<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In an age in which corporate malfeasance abounds, too much of the mainstream media has been unaccountably lax in covering the abuses of big business. Luckily for us--and unluckily for would-be white-collar criminals--one indispensable journal has kept a watchful eye on corporations for the last quarter century. 
<p>
In 1980, <i><a href="http://multinationalmonitor.org/monitor.html">Multinational Monitor</a></i> was founded by Ralph Nader and a rag-tag band of socially conscious reporters who felt that corporate power was "undergoing a transformation, mutating into something more fundamentally global in scope and profoundly more dangerous."  Published nine times a year, the <i>Monitor</i> is not glamorous or immediately recognizable outside of activist and political media circles. But its hard-hitting stories on corporate environmental abuse, health and safety violations, and exploitation of developing nations have long held the feet of executives to the fire.

<p>
The <i>Monitor</i>'s <a href="http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2004/122004/mokhiber.html">most widely publicized feature</a> in recent years has been its annual list of the "Top Ten Worst Corporations," compiled by Robert Weissman (who also serves as editor) and Russell Mokhiber of <i><a href="http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com">Corporate Crime Reporter</a></i>. This past year, Coca-Cola, Merck, and--you guessed it--Wal-Mart all made the list, which spread through the blogosphere like wildfire and caused migraines for corporate PR firms.
<p>
We're also big fans of the <i>Monitor</i>'s bi-monthly Lawrence Summers Memorial Award--named after the loose-lipped Harvard president and former Treasury Secretary, who once suggested that polluting developing nations was a fiscally responsible strategy (among other ridiculous things).  A recent recipient was <a href="http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2005/032005/front.html#AWARD">SeaCode</a>: a company, according to the <i>Monitor</i>, "which plans on locating a cruise ship in international waters, just off of the California coast, and out of reach of US labor, employment and immigration law, to house a software development company." 

<p>
It's no wonder that hundreds of advocacy groups rely on the <i>Monitor</i>'s consistently bold investigative reporting. "I think they are the only reliable source of information on global corporations," says John Cavanaugh, director of the <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org">Institute for Policy Studies</a>. "It's amazing to me that they're the only magazine that is explicitly devoted to the issue of the excess of corporate power--which is probably the greatest challenge to democracy in the world."
<p>
Happy 25th <i>Multinational Monitor</i>. Keep giving ‘em hell.
