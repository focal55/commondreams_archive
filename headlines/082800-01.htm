BOGOTA - Suspected members of Colombia's feared

right-wing paramilitary forces killed 22 people in two separate

massacres over the weekend, police and local media reported on

Sunday.

<p>Some 150 heavily armed men killed 10 people in the town of

Cienega near Colombia's Caribbean coast in a predawn raid

Sunday after pulling their victims from their beds and from a

dance hall, a police spokesman said.

<p>``This was the work of the so-called self-defense groups,'' a

regional police spokesman told Reuters by telephone, referring

to the paramilitary groups.

</TABLE>Separately, another paramilitary death squad killed 12

people overnight Saturday in three towns near the Pacific port

of Buenaventura after announcing they would act against

suspected leftist rebel collaborators, RCN television reported.

<p>Ultra-right paramilitary gangs are loosely organized under

the umbrella group known as the United Self-defense Forces of

Colombia (AUC) that battles leftist rebels and often

selectively kills guerrilla sympathizers.

<p>Colombia has suffered three decades of fighting between the

Marxist guerrillas, state security forces and paramilitary

groups. More than 35,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in

the past ten years alone.
