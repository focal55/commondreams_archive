PRISTINA, Kosovo, May 22 -- One 

boy was killed and two other children 

were seriously wounded by a cluster 

bomb on Sunday, and a United Nations official said today that NATO 

had delayed the marking and removal of its unexploded bombs.



<p>  Since refugees returned to Kosovo 

in June, more than 100 people have 

died in mine and bomb accidents, 

and hundreds have been wounded. 

 An estimated 40 percent have been 

the victims of cluster bombs.



<p>  One cluster bomb releases up to 

200 bomblets that scatter over a wide 

area and should explode on impact. 

But explosives experts have found 

that there is a high failure rate, as 

high as 20 percent in some areas, and 

the bombs lie on the surface or often 

dig into the earth. Children and farmers often find the bright-colored, 

shuttlecock-shaped bombs.



<p> NATO did not provide detailed information on the airstrikes that 

dropped 1,392 cluster bombs on Kosovo until two weeks ago, nearly a year 

after the conflict ended, said John 

Flanagan, program manager of the 

United Nations Mine Action Coordination Center. It coordinates civilian 

organizations clearing mines and unexploded ordinance across Kosovo.



<p>  "It was definitely frustrating," 

Mr. Flanagan said. "Ten months after the conflict finished, we are just 

getting to grips with the information, 

and it shouldn't be like that." 



<p>   Teams that search for unexploded 

mines have been able to mark only 60 

to 70 percent of the cluster bomb 

sites so far. That much  could have 

been accomplished earlier if the 

teams had  the information on the 

airstrikes, he said. 



<p>  The NATO-led peacekeeping force 

in Kosovo has also failed to meet its 

commitments to survey and mark 

the bombed areas, he said. "It became clear that we did not have all 

the information, and the marking 

was not done," Mr. Flanagan said. 

"Sometimes the first we knew of a 

strike area was when there was a 

casualty."  



<p>  Another sore topic has been whether depleted-uranium munitions were 

used in the air campaign in Kosovo. 

NATO finally admitted in February 

that such munitions were used.  Last 

week the United Nations secretary 

general, Kofi Annan, wrote to the 

NATO secretary general, George 

Robertson, asking for detailed maps 

showing where those strikes were 

made in Kosovo.   

<p>           



<p>  Mr. Annan asked for precise areas 

of the strikes and for assistance to 

undertake "systematic radiation 

measurements and sampling." He 

also asked for help in preventing 

damage from the munitions. 



<p>  While there is some debate about 

the danger of depleted-uranium debris, there is no doubt about the 

danger of cluster bombs, which has 

shocked both peacekeeping soldiers 

and civilians  working to render the 

mines harmless. "Cluster bombs almost always cause multiple casualties, and it is nearly always young 

people who get injured," Mr. Flanagan said. "We did not anticipate the 

number of them used and their attractiveness to kids."  



<p>  Refugees in the camps were not 

warned of the dangers of cluster 

bombs, he added, and even soldiers 

under the NATO command were not 

always well-informed.   In the 10 1/2  

months before April this year, there 

were 478 casualties in Kosovo from 

mines or bombs, and 100 of them 

were fatalities, Mr. Flanagan said. 

With the arrival of spring, the casualty figure has climbed again, to 15 

casualties in April. Four  teams are 

concentrating on clearing cluster 

bombs and hope to clear  the 333 

known sites of  bomblets this year.



<p>  But the bomblets from a single 

bomb can scatter over a large area.   

When he applied directly to the United States military, Mr. Flanagan 

said, he finally received vital details 

like the direction of attack of the 

plane and wind conditions.   

<p>



<p>  He blames the structure of NATO 

and of the peacekeeping force as 

much as anything for the delay and 

lack of help.   Under their mandate, 

peacekeepers have restricted themselves to clearance they judged essential to their mission, and they 

have left the mine clearance to civilian teams financed by the United 

Nations. 



<p>  "A lot of work was done, and then 

there was a line drawn in the sand," 

Mr. Flanagan said, alluding to the 

fact that many military explosives 

experts were pulled out, even while 

cluster bomb sites remained unmapped and uncleared. "They could 

have made a significant dent in the 

situation."
