WASHINGTON  - Forced labour and other human rights

abuses

associated with building natural gas pipelines in Myanmar

(formerly known as

Burma) continue with the knowledge of US and European corporations

which

partially own and manage the projects, according to a new report

released  here

Monday by Earthrights International (ERI).

<P>

''The abuses are not incidental or unrelated to the pipelines -

they are a

direct result of western companies' investments,'' says the

report, 'Total

Denial Continues.' 

<P>

Three prominent companies have invested in the region to construct

pipelines:

Union Oil of California (UNOCAL), and Total, a French company are

involved  in

the Yadana pipeline. And the British company, Premier Oil, is part

of a

consortium building the Yetagun pipeline. 

<P>

The 180-page report is based on first-hand testimony gathered

between 1995  and

2000 from several hundred villagers who claim to either be victims

or

witnesses

- including Burmese army deserters - to recent abuse. 

<P>

Ka Hsaw Wa, a member of Burma's Karen ethnic minority, who is co-

director of

ERI, gathered the interviews which document hundreds of recent

cases of  rape,

execution and confiscation of property carried out by the

military. 

<P>

Most of the testimony revolves around the Yadana pipeline which

was  completed

early this year and has already begun operations.  

<P>

The 1 billion dollar project, operated by a consortium that

includes UNOCAL,

Total and the government of Myanmar, carries natural gas through

Burma to

Thailand. 

<P>

Many people interviewed from Karen, Tavoyan and Mon villages in

the pipeline

regions say the area was never heavily militarised before

construction  began.

Now they claim they are victimised by an army which has been

condemned for  its

abuses by the US State Department, the United Nations, and many

other

organisations. 

<P>

''I wish the foreign companies would go back to their country ...

so the

troops

will go back to Rangoon,'' says one Tavoyan villager interviewed

in 1999. 

<P>

The report also examines reports of forced labour and other rights

abuses

surrounding the 70 million dollar Yetagun gas pipeline. Premier

Oil, acting  as

operator of the project, is part of a consortium currently

developing

off-shore

gas reserves in the Yetagun field in the Gulf of Martaban.á

Yetagun ''is  as

much a problem as the Yadana project, and Premier has surely

benefited as  much

from these crimes as have Total and UNOCAL,'' says the report.  

<P>

"Total Denial Continues" also includes company documents never

before made

public that ERI says prove that corporations knew that forced

labour was  being

employed on their projects. 

<P>

''The companies knew from their own consultants that abuses were

occurring

surrounding their projects, yet they continued involvement,''

according to  the

report.  

<P>

All three companies strongly deny accusations of complicity in

rights  abuses.  

<P>

Charles Jamieson, the Chief Executive of Premier Oil, says he

disagrees with

activists who want to isolate Myanmar.á ''We believe in

constructive

engagement

rather than closing the country off to the world,'' he says.  

<P>

John Imle, former president of UNOCAL, admits that when the

project was  first

being constructed, the military used conscripted labour for

porterage. 

<P>

''I know that in the early days of this project, military units in

the

areas of

the project were using conscripted labour,'' he said. But he says

this does

not

happen anymore. 

<P>

''When I'm visiting these people in these villagers they say,

'We're glad

you're here, please stay,'' says Imle, referring to health and

education

facilities provided by the company.  

<P>

In 1997, United States federal court agreed to hear a lawsuit

brought  against

Unocal and Total by 14 victims for alleged human rights abuses

associated  with

the Yadana project. 

<P>

Federal Judge Richard A. Paez declared that transnational

corporations and

their executive officers can be held legally responsible for

violations of

international human rights law in foreign countries, and that US

courts have

the authority to adjudicate such claims.  

<P>

The decision, contained in a 38-page written order, calls some of

Unocal's

arguments ''inexplicable'' and ''hard to imagine.'' 

<P>

Plaintiffs in the case are represented by a team of lawyers from

ERI, the  New

York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, Hadsell & Stormer and

the Law

offices of Paul Hoffman. The case is seen as ground breaking since

it lays  the

foundation for victims in other countries to sue US corporations

for human

rights violations.  

<P>

Since 1994 activists have been trying to get company shareholders

to approve

resolutions that would force UNOCAL to review its operations in

Myanmar.

But at

each shareholder meeting, the proposals have only received a small

percentage

of the vote.  

<P>

With their protest outside UNOCAL's shareholder meeting near Los

Angeles

Monday, human rights and religious groups, and pro-democracy

Burmese

organisations hope to again draw attention to the issue.
