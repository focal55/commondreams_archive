SAVAR, Bangladesh, Dec 7  - The World Bank and its market-

driven health policies are getting the ire of health activists and

experts here, who say the Bank's cures are harming the developing-

country patients they seek to help. 

<P>

   Criticism of the bank and health priorities driven by the

market peaked has been a key theme of the ongoing People's Health

Assembly (PHA) here, but peaked during a stormy face-off

Wednesday. 

<P>

   At that session between the World Bank and health activists,

Bank representative Richard Lee Skolnik was treated to the display

of a giant cloth montage with brightly embroidered newspaper

headlines, which told stories of the harmful effects of the Bank's

structural adjustment programme (SAP) in Zimbabwe. 

<P>

   The headlines spoke of rising food prices, increasing crime,

and labour retrenchment. 

<P>

   These, presenter Mary Sandari said, are the direct result of

the country's acceding to SAP to pay back its debts as directed by

the bank. 

<P>

   Skolnik responded by saying the Bank only asked Zimbabwe to

manage its economy soundly and did not tell it to cut funding to

the social sectors. 

<P>

   Sandasi's presentation was followed by another by Hugo Icu, a

doctor from Guatemala who outlined the collapse of primary health

care in his country as a direct consequence of his government's

following the Bank's prescriptions. 

<P>

   Skolnik said the World Bank's health policies were helping poor

countries like India fight leprosy, polio, tuberculosis and

HIV/AIDS. 

<P>

   But at this remark, angry delegates to the health assembly

shouted ''get out''  and chanted ''no, no,'' until PHA project

coordinator Zafarullah Choudhury threatened to call off the week-

long PHA which ends Friday. 

<P>

   Skolnik was not allowed to finish his presentation, but instead

heard activists telling the Bank about the need to  restore the

primary health care approach promoted since the 1978 ''Health for

all Declaration'' at an global meeting at Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. 

<P>

   Critics say the global pledge set at that meeting -- which

included primary health care for all by 2000 -- have now all but

been scuttled by the Bank's approach which deprives developing-

country budgets of funds for social sectors. 

<P>

   ''We don't want charity but justice,'' said Charles Mutasa, a

panelist from Zimbabwe, adding that the Bank's approach has driven

many African countries into a debt trap as a result of the new

global economic system.  

<P>

   Mutasa spoke of ''exogenous'' factors that made debt repayment

difficult, such as floods, corruption and civil strife, the last

of which ''the west was so good at pioneering.''  

<P>

   To this, Skolnik explained that ''there was no substitute for

good governance'' and that the Bank should indeed be ''hit hard''

for lending money to bad regimes. 

<P>

   But Antonio Tujan, an activist from the Philippines, disputed

the assertion that Bank funds went into social sectors. In his

country, he said, less than three percent of its loans actually

went into public health.  

<P>

   ''Most of the money goes into projects like the Subic

freeport,'' he said, referring to a vast infrastructure project

for business at a former U.S. military bases, north of the capital

Manila. 

<P>

   Looking at the effects of economic 'reforms' on health, Tujan

said there has been ''progressive destruction of the people's

health agenda'' by the private corporatisation of health services,

which has a curative rather than a preventive approach.   

<P>

   As things stand, Tujan said, he wonders if ''no medicine is

better than bad medicine.''    

<P>

    A panelist from Australia, David Leggae, said that although

the Bank's 'Wealth through growth which would trickle down'

approach provided the rationale for neoliberalism and structural

adjustment, it was also responsible for economic polarisation and

increased mortality. 

<P>

   There are too many fundamental flaws in the Bank's approach, he

said, since it is based on the idea that ''consumption could be

maintained by increasing debt'' and that an economic crisis could

thus be deferred.  

<P>

   Basically, Leggae adds, the game is one of maintaining the

stability and wealth of the North at the cost of the well-being

and health of the South. 

<P>

   He said this game is backed by the Bank, the International

Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation (WTO), news

corporations, money markets and rating agencies, among others. 

<P>

   Leggae adds that the only counteraction available to the

''unfair'' global trade regime, which transfers wealth to the

North at the cost of social sectors in the South, is popular

mobilisation like the recent ones seen at trade and economic

meetings in Seattle, Geneva, Melbourne and Paris. 

<P>

   He says also that people's understanding of regulatory regimes

and governance structures in the global system is ''essential to

demand a global trading system which discriminates positively in

favour of poor countries.'' 

<P>

   Leggae advised the Bank to ''apologise for deaths and suffering

caused by structural adjustment and stop claiming privileged

access to divine truth, and acknowledge that embedded in its

recommendations were its core constituency -- the privileged

West.''  

<P>

   Interventions from the floor were even more biting. ''There is

an easy way out of all this -- the World Bank and IMF have enough

resources to cancel debts,'' said Robert Weissman, co-director of

the U.S.-based group Essential Action. 

<P>

   ''The World Bank's own case studies showed that in the last 20

years it had made no effect even on a single district in India,''

pointed out Ravi Narayan from India, the Bank's biggest borrower. 

<P>

   Narayan said while the World Bank may not directly ask for cuts

in social sectors, its adjustment programmes inevitably led to

governments to take on adverse fiscal policies, including

inadequate financial allocations for capital and recurrent costs

for the social sectors. 

<P>

   These same policies led to shortages in health equipment, drugs

and facilities, which happened in India, Narayan says.

In turn, deteriorating conditions bring down the performance of

health personnel, said South African David Sanders. 

<P>

   Commenting on the discussion, Halfdan Mahler, the architect of

the primary health care approach as director general of the World

Health Organisation (WHO) from 1973-1988, told IPS that the Bank

was again ''postponing the coming explosion'' through its

untenable positions. 

<P>

   Mahler blamed the World Bank's ''hijacking of health'' from the

WHO in 1993 and the abandonment of the primary health approach for

the crisis in public health management, especially in developing

countries.
