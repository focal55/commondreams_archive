MARIN, CALIFORNIA --    Environmental waste has put the life support system of 

the planet on Red Alert, and ``human rights'' in the 21st century 

means the right to be born free of toxins, experts said over the 

weekend at a conference for environmental solutions.

<P>  ``If Thomas Jefferson were here today, he'd be calling for a Bill 

of Responsibilities,'' said environmental architect and designer 

William McDonough, who called for a new Industrial Revolution in 

which ecology, accountability and profit are siblings on equal 

footing in the global economy. ``When the Exxon Valdez spills, the 

(gross domestic product) of Alaska goes way up because everyone's at 

work on the cleanup. Our activity is not our legacy.''	 

</P>

<P>  The speeches were given at the 10th annual <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers</a> conference, 

held in San Rafael. The word bioneers means ``biological pioneers,'' 

and the yearly conference featured an eclectic group of speakers from 

around the country -- scientists, doctors, businesspeople, authors, 

academics and artists -- who subscribe to a ``Declaration of 

Interdependence'' that says humans 

and nature are inextricably linked. Over 2,000 attendees came to the 

Marin Center meeting.	 

</P>

<P>  McDonough, who won a presidential award for sustainable 

development, discussed projects such as developing ``infinitely 

recyclable'' polyester for Nike's running shoes and his current work 

on redesigning the Ford Motor Co. facility in Michigan. The Virginia 

resident also designed the Gap office complex in San Bruno, which is 

30 percent more energy efficient than California law requires.	 

</P>

<P>   Author Alice Walker said one of the nation's most critical 

restoration projects is creating a culture that respects elders and 

connects them with youth -- most likely through cyberspace. She told 

the audience it was time to grow up -- and that she didn't even hit 

her stride till her 50s.	 

</P>

<P>  ``By not growing up, we miss out on ever becoming adults,'' she 

said. ``Elders are a government soon to be in exile.''	 

</P>

<P>  The conference was founded by Santa Fe resident Kenny Ausubel in 

1990. ``One of the problems for the public with the environmental 

movement is the gloom and doom scenario,'' said Ausubel, who now runs 

<a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers</a> with his wife, Nina Simons. ``The conversation changes 

radically when people realize there are solutions.''	 

Many of those solutions were offered by presenters from the Bay Area, 

such as Dr. Michael Lerner of Bolinas' Commonweal, a health and 

environmental institute that has attracted attention for its 

innovative programs for cancer patients. Lerner spoke on his newest 

campaign, Health Care Without Harm, an organization working with 

hospitals to stop the incineration of medical waste containing dioxin 

and mercury. In four years, it has grown from 30 people to 300 member 

organizations in 30 countries.	 

</P>

<P>  ``We're living in an epidemic of chronic health problems (such as) 

cancer and learning disorders due to chemical exposure,'' said 

Lerner, who equated the right of a fetus to be born free of toxins to 

labor rights, civil rights and women's rights.	 

</P>

<P>   Although <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers</a> began in Santa Fe, it outgrew the city in its 

third year, and Ausubel and Simons moved the meeting to the Bay Area 

because of its progressive environmental community. Bioneers has 

evolved into a national public radio series, and Simon and Ausubel 

are also exploring the possibility of a TV show.	 

</P>

<P>  Bioneers was born out of Ausubel's work in the 1980s producing a 

documentary on Harry Hoxsey, a former coal miner who in the 1950s 

created the world's largest privately owned cancer clinic using 

herbal therapy, and his co-founding of Seeds of Change, the organic 

seed firm dedicated to ``backyard biodiversity.'' (Ausubel has since 

parted ways with the company.)	 

</P>

<P>  Ausubel and Simon both say they see the conference not just as a 

forum for eco-visionaries, but as a way for them to cross-pollinate. 

British biologist Dr. Mae-Wan Ho, for example, is collaborating with 

Chicago cancer prevention expert Dr. Samuel Epstein on a book on 

genetic engineering, after meeting at a previous Bioneers conference.	 

</P>

<P>   ``Part of the solution is in these ecological technologies,'' 

says Ausubel, ``But another part is a change of heart.'' In the hard 

drive of humanity, there is a fundamental systems error, says 

Ausubel, and that is ``thinking we're apart from -- rather than a 

part of -- nature.''	 

</P>

<P>  Among the most popular speakers were mycologist Paul Stamets of 

Washington state, who has done scientifically documented work 

breaking down hazardous waste with fungi, and the Body Shop's Anita 

Roddick, whose projects include sending employees of her cosmetics 

company to postwar Kosovo to help with rebuilding efforts.	 

</P>

<P>  About 60 percent of the people who came to Bioneers this year were 

from California, the rest from other parts of the United States and 

from around the globe. The crowd was diverse -- moms with babies and 

toddlers in tow; architects, activists, doctors and dot-commers; 

aging hippies clad in hemp. Law student Glen Banfield of Oregon came 

because he wanted to get ideas for an environmental justice 

conference he's organizing himself.	 

</P>

<P>  ``It makes no sense to blame anyone about the environment at this 

point,'' said Banfield. ``It's better to be proactive and do 

something about it.''	 

</P>

<P>  Jeanne Besanceney, a 34-year-old San Franciscan attending the 

conference Saturday, recently quit a lucrative job at a Silicon 

Valley dot-com to volunteer for Ralph Nader's Green Party campaign. 

She came to Bioneers, she said, because ``I think the lifestyle of 

the boom economy is alienating us from nature. Endless amounts of 

hours in front of the computers . . . the emphasis on the machine 

world. It's a false sense of community.	 

</P>

<P>  ``To come here and to stay in touch with the people I meet 

afterward -- it's the best natural antidepressant there is.''
