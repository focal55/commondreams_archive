UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has

denounced

one of the most ''reprehensible'' violations of human rights: the

global trade

in human beings. 

<P>

''I believe the trafficking of persons, particularly women and

children, for

forced and exploitative labour, including for sexual exploitation,

is one of

the most egregious violations of human rights which the United

Nations now

confronts,'' he said in a statement released Wednesday. 

<P>

According to the Geneva-based International Organisation for

Migration (IOM),

human trafficking is a thriving 7-billion-dollar annual global

business with

links to the international arms trade, drugs, prostitution and

child abuse. 

<P>

In the United States alone, an estimated 500,000 women and

children - from

Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe - are trafficked into the

country each

year to work as prostitutes, servants or in sweat shops in the

garment

industry. 

<P>

Addressing a UN conference in Palermo, Italy, Annan said Tuesday

that the

trade

in human beings was both ''widespread and growing''. 

<P>

It is rooted in social and economic conditions in the countries

from which the

victims come, facilitated by practices which discriminate against

women, and

driven by cruel indifference to human suffering on the part of

those who

exploit the services that the victims are forced to provide, he

added. 

<P>

The four-day conference, which is for the signing of a new UN

Convention

Against Transnational Organised Crime, is being attended by

ministers and

delegates from over 120 countries.  

<P>

Urging member states to sign and ratify the Convention, which

includes

provisions against human trafficking and smuggling of migrants,

Annan said the

fate of these most vulnerable people is ''an affront to human

dignity and a

challenge to every state, every people, and every community''. 

<P>

The Convention - the first legally binding UN treaty to fight

organised

crime -

was adopted by the General Assembly last month and will enter into

force after

40 countries have ratified it. 

<P>

For the first time, the convention offers the international

community

universally recognised definitions of several fundamental concepts

of criminal

law linked to organised crime. The 41 articles in the convention

define

concepts such as ''organised criminal group'', ''serious offence''

and

''proceeds of crime''. 

<P>

The new treaty is expected to strengthen governments against all

forms of

serious crimes, including money laundering, arms smuggling,

international

fraud, drug trafficking and corruption. 

<P>

The need for a convention has arisen due to a surge in

transnational crimes

prompted by globalisation. Open borders and advanced technology,

which have

propelled international trade and global commerce, have also led

to an

increase

in cross border crimes. 

<P>

Annan said that criminal groups have wasted no time in embracing

today's

globalised economy and the sophisticated technology that goes with

it. ''But

our efforts to combat them have remained, up to now, very

fragmented, and our

weapons almost obsolete,'' he added. 

<P>

Annan pointed out that the Palermo Convention, however, gives a

new tool to

address the scourge of crime as a global problem.  

<P>

''With enhanced international co-operation, we can have a real

impact on the

ability of international criminals to operate successfully, and

help citizens

everywhere in their struggle for safety and dignity in their homes

and

communities,'' he said. 

<P>

The signing of the Convention, he said, would be a watershed event

in the

reinforcement of the UN fight against organised crime. 

<P>

Addressing delegates, the Italian Minister of Justice Piero

Fassino said: ''We

are no longer citizens of individual countries, but of the world.

Crime is

more

organised at a transnational level while technology has increased

mobility for

all. Both licit and illicit interests have become transnational

and new

figures

of illegality have arisen, as have new forms of crime.'' 

<P>

The Italian government, he said, is supporting a proposal under

which 25

percent of the confiscated proceeds of organised crime will be

paid to the

United Nations to help fight transnational crimes. 

<P>

UN Under-Secretary-General Pino Arlacchi of Italy, executive

director of

the UN

Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, said that until

recently, the

Sicilian city of Palermo was the centre of one of the world's most

notorious

mafias. 

<P>

''Our presence here this week, and adoption of the Convention, is

a potent

symbol of hope. It is a lesson for those who believe that cross-

border

crime is

invincible - too big or too complex to be faced down by the rule

of law,'' he

noted. 

<P>

Arlacchi, who is best known for his relentless battle against

mafia syndicates

in his home country, paid tributes to two judges, Giovanni Falcone

and Paolo

Borsellino, who were killed by the Sicilian mafia back in 1992. 

<P>

''Their deaths remind us that the struggle against organised crime

is never

cost-free. This is the reason why this Convention is a milestone

measure a

living tribute to the thousands of men and women who have lost

their lives in

pursuit of a world free of mafias and criminal violence,'' he

added. 

<P>

''I hope that today will be the beginning of a process - one that

will result

in the reclaiming of many cities around the world - for peace,

justice and the

rule of law.''
