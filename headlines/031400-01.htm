<p>Buoyed by a string of recent

campaign

successes, consumer groups around the world are now demanding

mandatory

labelling of genetically modified (GM) food as they mark World

Consumer

Rights Day on March 15, reflecting growing concern about the

unregulated

production and trade of GM food crops.

<P>

	Mandatory labelling, insist the groups, would enable consumers to

make

informed choices û a basic consumer right. It would also protect

their  right

to safety by allowing any subsequent health problems to be

properly

identified and traced back to source. 

<P>

	Genetic engineering takes the DNA of genes from one organism

(animals,

plants, bacteria) and inserts them into a completely different

organism

(e.g. food crops) to transfer a desired trait. Plants are

genetically

modified to improve resistance to pests and weed-killers. But

activists

worry about the long-term effects of tampering with nature. 

<P>

	Creating herbicide-tolerant crops is like ''giving one plant a

radiation

suit, then dropping a small nuclear device to wipe out all other

plant life

in the area, as well as the animal life that depends on it, along

with any

hope of sustainable agriculture,'' wrote Andrew Simms of Christian

Aid. 

<P>

	Consumers are reacting with growing concern, says Julian Edwards,

the

director general of <a href="http://www.consumersinternational.org/wcrd/">Consumers International</a>, a federation of over

250

consumers' organisations in 111 countries. 

<P>

	Foremost is the fear that GM crops might be dangerous to eat in

some way,

he points out, saying that consumers face risks from the

unintended effects

of GM foods. 

<P>

	Edwards was speaking here at the launch last week of a CI

campaign kit to

heighten awareness of consumer rights using the theme <a href="http://www.consumersinternational.org/wcrd/">'Our Food,

Whose

Choice? Consumers Take Action on GM Foods'</a>. 

<P>

	Genetic modification can transfer allergies from foods that

people know

they are allergic to to foods they think are safe. About 2 percent

of

adults and 8 percent of children have true food allergies and

about one

quarter have

reacted adversely to some type of food. 

<P>

	''Failure to label GM foods,'' says the CI campaign kit, ''would

mean that

people with allergies have no way of knowing whether they are

eating

potentially risky foods or, in the event of problems, what

ingredient

provoked the reaction.'' 

<P>

	Activists also highlight the uncertain long-term effects on

nutrition and

health posed by GM foods. They point to the use of antibiotic-

resistant

genes as ''markers'' (to track the gene carrying the trait being

transferred)

in GM crops, which, they say, could add to the problem of

antibiotic

resistance. Genetic manipulation, argue the activists, could also

increase

levels of natural plant toxins in foods or create entirely new

toxins in

unexpected ways. 

<P>

	''The testing has not been as rigorous as it is with medicine,''

says

physician Nadine Gusman, a World Health Organisation consultant.

Gusman

wondered who was carrying out the research. Were they the same

firms

developing the technology, she asks. 

<P>

	The other major risk, notes Edward, is the impact GM foods will

have on

the environment: ''Do they support sustainable agriculture in the

long  run?'' 

<P>

	Critics say genes from GM crops could contaminate wild plants,

which could

then become resistant or toxic to certain plant pests. The wind,

birds, and

insects could carry pollen from GM plants and once released may

cause

permanent gene pollution. Crops engineered to resist herbicide and

pesticides may pass their traits on to their wild relatives and

create

pesticide-and herbicide-resistant super-weeds, they say. 

<P>

	GM organisms also threaten to diminish biological diversity, say

the

activists. The cultivation of GM organisms, they add, could lead

to the

wiping out of weeds and insects. If that happens, the species that

depend on

them will also suffer. 

<P>

	There is also the question of seed ownership by big firms through

patenting and terminator technology. ''Farmers in the South are

angry

because they don't feel that anyone should own their seeds,'' says

Jennife r

Mourin, the Safe Food Campaign Coordinator of the Pesticide Action

Network's Asia-Pacific

office in Penang. 

<P>

	The main commercially cultivated GM foods are soya, maize, rape

seed

(canola), potatoes and tomatoes. GM soya is present in about 60

percent of

all soy derivatives, including vegetable oils, soy flour, lecithin

and soy

protein. GM corn can be found in 50 percent of all corn products

and

derivatives, such as corn starch, corn flour and corn syrup. 

<P>

	Over 90 percent of these processed foods are excluded from

European Union

labelling norms, the most stringent in the world. 

<P>

	Other GM foods expected soon include rice, sugar, and beets.

Animal feed

is the principal market for GM crops. Some 98 percent of global

transgenic

crop acreage is accounted for by just three countries: the United

States,

Canada, and Argentina. The US has by far the largest acreage at

20.5

million hectares or 74 percent of the GM fields as of 1998. 

<P>

	The Rio Declaration of the 1992 Earth Summit stated that

governments have

to take a ''better safe than sorry'' approach to potential

environmental

and health risks. This means that the burden of proof for a

product's

long-term

safety falls on its producer. 

<P>

	According to the Rural Advancement Foundation International

(RAFI) in

Canada, the top five Gene Giants account for nearly two thirds of

the global

pesticide market, about a quarter of the commercial seed market,

and

virtually all the GM seed market. The five are AstaZeneca, DuPont,

Monsanto,

Novartis and Aventis. Monsanto alone controls nearly 90 percent of

the GM

seed market in the U.S., where farmers plant roughly half of their

corn,

cotton and soyfields with GM crops. 

<P>

	The biotech industry and many regulatory agencies argue that the

composition of GM food is not chemically different from

conventional ones

in ways that could jeopardise their safety or nutritional value.

Using this

concept of ''substantial equivalence'', they argue that GM foods

require no

special safety testing or labelling. 

<P>

	''This is being strongly resisted by us and other national

governments,''

says Edwards. 

<P>

	Some activist groups would prefer an outright ban on GM foods,

saying that

labelling would be meaningless for illiterate people, especially

in

developing countries. 

<P>

	Although its backers say GM foods are the answer to world hunger

and can

produce more nutritious food, critics feel otherwise. ''Are the

big gains

promised actually there?'' asks Mourin. With GM crops, Mourin

argues that

pesticide use will actually go up with disastrous impact for

consumers and

the environment. 

<P>

	Consumer groups are fighting back. In a David vs Goliath battle

in Brazil,

the 'Instituto de Defesa do Consumidor' (IDEC) and its allies,

using a

campaign slogan 'GM Foods: Don't Swallow that Stuff', stopped the

commercial planting of GM seeds in a country where 25 percent of

the world 's

soya is grown.  The federal court ruled in June 1999 that Monsanto

had to

present an environmental impact assessment before any GM soya

could be

planted and sold commercially. 

<P>

	Although some groups want a total ban on GM foods, most consumer

groups

recognise the strategic value of pressing for mandatory labelling.

''Labelling is the key issue,'' conceded a spokesperson for a

Monsanto

subsidiary to the press. ''If you put a label on genetically

engineered

food, you might as well put a skull and crossbones on it.''
