LONDON - The British government illegally expelled nearly 2,000 inhabitants

of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean at the height of the Cold War

to make way for a strategic U.S. military base on Diego Garcia, the High

Court ruled here Friday.

<p>The judges overturned a 1971 immigration order banning the Ilois

islanders from their native lands and decided that the exiles--now

numbering about 4,500 with descendants, according to their attorneys, and

living in Mauritius and the Seychelles--have a right to return to the

65-island archipelago.

<p>"For us, it is a historical day to win this fight. It seems like David

and Goliath," said Olivier Bancoult, chairman of the Chagos Refugee Group

in Mauritius, who was exiled in 1968 at the age of 4. "We all think about

returning, and we want compensation for all we have been suffering."

<p>The British government said it will not appeal the decision and will

complete an ongoing feasibility study on resettling the exiles.

<p>The U.S. government is not party to the suit. In Washington, the

Pentagon reacted warily to the ruling.

<p>"The United States does have a strategic interest on Diego Garcia,"

said a Defense Department official who asked not to be named because of

the sensitivity of the case. "But this is a matter between the British

authorities and the individuals who brought the case. We have no comment

on the merits of the case."

<p>The official added, however, that Diego Garcia "has played a primary

role in the support of naval and Air Force units operating in the Indian

Ocean and the Persian Gulf."

<p>U.S. units responding to Middle East crises have used the base to

refuel. The Air Force and Marine Corps store heavy equipment on Diego

Garcia for use in the event of a Middle East emergency. U.S. warplanes

based on the island flew missions during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

<p>"It's one of the two or three single most important U.S. military

bases in the world," said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense policy expert at

the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

<p>Bancoult's attorney, Richard Gifford, said the U.S. government filed a

statement during the hearing opposing the islanders' return to the

archipelago on the grounds that it would be a "threat to national

security," despite a distance of more than 130 miles between the air base

and the nearest island.

<p>The case of the exiled islanders is seen by many here as a sad chapter

of Britain's colonial past and Cold War history. It has been an

embarrassment for British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who expressed

outrage at the eviction as a young member of Parliament when the story

first came to light in 1975--then had to send attorneys to defend the

action in the High Court hearing in July.

<p>The Foreign Office said after the decision that "the government has

not defended what was done or said 30 years ago" and, as the court

recognized, "made no attempt to conceal the gravity of what happened."

<p>The Chagos islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965 and became a

new colony called the British Indian Ocean Territory. The deal with

then-Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson led to Mauritius' independence

three years later.

<p>About 1,500 miles south of India, in a region of interest to China and

the Soviet Union, the territory was leased in 1966 to the United States

for use as an air and naval base for 50 years.

<p>The U.S. government reportedly gave Britain a multimillion-dollar

discount on its U.S.-made Polaris nuclear weapons system as payment for

use of the islands. A memo from Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart to

Wilson in 1969 admitted that the U.S. payment for use of the islands was

kept secret from Parliament and the U.S. Congress.

<p>But the United States wanted a land without people, and the islands

were depopulated by stealth between 1967 and 1973, according to

information revealed in a U.S. congressional investigation in 1975 and in

Foreign Office documents declassified after 30 years and introduced in

the case.

<p>Although some of the islanders--descendants of African and Indian

plantation workers--had lived there for generations, Britain asserted

that they were temporary migrants and therefore could be removed without

concern for their rights.

<p>Paul Gore-Booth, a senior Foreign Office official in 1966, wrote to a

diplomat, "We must surely be very tough about this. The object of the

exercise is to get some rocks which will remain ours. . . . There will be

no indigenous population except sea gulls. . . ."

<p>Residents who left the island for any reason were prevented from

returning. The remaining inhabitants eventually were evicted to Mauritius

and the Seychelles, where they failed to adjust to city life. Most

remained on the fringes of society, poor and uneducated.

<p>Bancoult recounted how his 11-member family went to Mauritius in 1968

so that his ill sister could see a doctor.

<p>After she died, the family tried to return home, "but we were told the

land had been given to the Americans for a U.S. military base."

<p>He recalled wanting to take to Mauritius a drum that his grandfather

had given him but was told to leave it behind. "We couldn't carry all of

our belongings, and we were thinking we would go back," he said.

<p>An electrician with three children of his own now, Bancoult said he

hopes he will be allowed to go home "and put flowers on my grandparents'

graves."

<p>In the decision, Lord Justice John Laws told the court that banishing

the islanders had been an "abject legal failure" by the British

government. The court said the government had used excessive zeal in

removing the population, even when judged by the standards of the

colonial times.

<p>Gifford, Bancoult's attorney, said he was uncertain how the government

ultimately would comply with the court ruling, whether the exiles would

be allowed to return to their native islands or be relocated on the

islands farthest from Diego Garcia, or whether they ultimately would be

asked to remain abroad and receive compensation.

<p>"We are ready to negotiate," Gifford said.

<p>O'Hanlon, the U.S. defense expert, said the impact of the decision

will depend on whether returning islanders are allowed to live anywhere

they wish. He said it appears possible that restrictions could be applied

to residents to prevent them from interfering with operations at the

military base.

<p>In the absence of such restrictions, O'Hanlon said, the ruling could

limit future military operations at Diego Garcia.

<p>"It could be a major hindrance," he said.
