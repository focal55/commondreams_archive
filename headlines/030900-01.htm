Over the past 500 million years, 

there have been dozens of episodes of 

extinction on the planet, the most 

famous being the titanic event that 

swept away the dinosaurs. Scientists 

have assumed that the time it takes 

for the living world to bounce back is 

proportional to the damage done: 

more time should be required to fill 

all of the earth's empty corners with 

newly evolved life after gargantuan 

extinctions and less time should be 

required after a more minor die-off.



<p>But in an entirely unexpected finding that has gotten the attention of 

both paleontologists and conservationists, researchers reported today 

that it takes a long time to recover 

from these large-scale extinctions -- 

around 10 million years -- and more 

intriguing, the recovery time appears to be the same, whether the 

original destruction was one of the 

grander or one of the more minor 

events.



<p> Many biologists say that by destroying tropical forests and other 

habitats, humans are driving species 

extinct at an accelerating rate that if 

unchecked will result in one of the 

major extinctions in history.



<p>  An ominous implication of the new 

research, some scientists say, is that 

humans may already or will soon 

have destroyed enough species that 

it will require a full 10 million years 

for the planet to recover -- 20 times 

as long as humans have already existed and longer than many scientists predict humanity itself is likely 

to persist into the future. 



<p> Scientists say the new study will 

also prompt paleontologists to rethink how life evolves after major 

extinctions,  events that have played 

a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of life.



<p> The study, by Dr. James W. Kirchner, an earth scientist at the University of California, and Dr. Anne Weil, 

a paleobiologist at Duke University, 

appears today in the journal Nature.



<p> "I think it's a surprise to everyone," said Dr. Douglas Erwin, a paleobiologist at the National Museum 

of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. "We're 

just at the beginning of understanding biotic recoveries following extinctions."



<p> Dr. Mike Foote, a paleobiologist at 

the University of Chicago, said the 

paper would change how people 

looked at the fossil record, adding, 

"It's going to be seminal." 



<p> Borrowing statistical techniques 

from other areas of geology and astrophysics, the researchers examined an enormous set of data gathered by the late Dr. Jack Sepkoski, a 

paleontologist at the University of 

Chicago. The data set documents 

when new kinds of marine animals 

first appear in the fossil record and 

when they disappear or go extinct. 



<p> Scientists expected that with every 

additional species that gets knocked 

out during an extinction, the longer 

the recovery should take. 



<p> What researchers found instead 

was that after extinctions, big and 

small, it took about 10 million years 

for the proliferation of new kinds of 

organisms to peak and then begin to 

tail off. The decrease in the proliferation of new creatures is seen as a 

sign that ecosystems have recovered 

and are so full of diverse life that 

there is little opportunity left for new 

organisms. 



<p> So unexpected was the outcome 

that Dr. Weil said that when Dr. 

Kirchner handed her the results, she 

said, "Did you do that right?" She 

added, "I made him do the analysis 

again while I was looking over his 

shoulder."



<p> Scientists said the new study suggested that the evolutionary rebuilding after an extinction might work 

differently than had been envisioned. 



<p> Many paleontologists had previously pictured extinctions as being 

the equivalent of wiping the pieces 

off a chessboard. In such a situation, 

though the pieces are gone, the 

spaces on the chessboard, the place 

for a queen or rook -- or in nature, 

the niche for an algae-eating fish or a 

long-lived evergreen tree -- are still 

there, each simply needing to be refilled by a newly evolved species.   

<p>



<p> But the new study, Dr. Erwin said, 

suggests instead that "when you 

wipe the pieces off the chessboard, 

the size of the chessboard shrinks." 

That is, with the loss of a species 

comes the loss of opportunities for 

the existence of other organisms as 

well -- like those that would make 

their living by preying upon or parasitizing that organism.



<p>  So when there are few types of 

organisms left after an extinction, 

there are few opportunities for new 

species to evolve. Each new kind of 

organism that does evolve creates 

more opportunities for other species, 

and each of those, in turn, creates 

more opportunities in a kind of  positive feedback loop, the dynamics of 

which may be setting the recovery 

clock at 10 million years.



<p> While some scientists predict that 

humanity will not live to see a recovery from the extinctions it has 

wrought, many questions remain. It 

is difficult to compare modern-day 

extinctions with those viewed 

through the lens of the fossil record.



<p>  As a result, scientists still do not 

agree on whether and when humanity will have destroyed enough species to require a 10 million year 

recovery, with some saying that 

point has already been reached, and 

others predicting it will be anywhere 

from 50 years to a thousand years or 

more in coming. 



<p> But if diversity is what provides 

the fuel for the recovery from any 

extinction, as the new work suggests, 

then in terms of a practical application, Dr. E. O. Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, 

said the message was clear.   

<p>"The 

bottom line," Dr. Wilson said, "is 

that we had better take care to hold 

on to the biodiversity that still exists."
