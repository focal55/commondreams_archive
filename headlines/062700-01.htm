PARIS  - Greenpeace refused on Tuesday to comply

with French government orders to move away from La Hague, where

the environmental pressure group has installed a camera on an

underwater pipe discharging radioactive waste into the sea.

<p>Greenpeace used the camera to <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/%7Enuclear/ospar2000/livecamconf.html">broadcast on the internet live</a>

footage of the discharge from the nuclear reprocessing plant at

La Hague, northern France. It wants to persuade an international

panel to ban sea dumping of radioactive waste from land pipes.

<p>Greenpeace campaigner Mike Townsley said French coastguards

had ordered the group to move its ships the Twister and MV

Greenpeace, its dinghies, divers and the webcam from the area by

0800 local time on Tuesday, saying the vessels no longer had

''innocent right of passage'' in French waters.

<p>

''We've moved the Twister into UK territorial waters, but we

haven't and won't move the MV Greenpeace, and we certainly won't

move the web camera,'' Townsley told Reuters by telephone from

the MV Greenpeace.

<p>``We're just making a peaceful protest. We haven't impeded

anything. We're just showing the delegates at the OSPAR meeting

the discharge they're supposed to ban,'' he said.

<p>Ministers from the 15 countries in the OSPAR Commission, set

up to protect the environment of the North Atlantic ocean, are

meeting in Copenhagen this week to discuss a proposal by Denmark

to ban sea dumping of radioactive waste from land pipes.

<p>OSPAR has already banned other forms of sea dumping of

nuclear waste -- from ships, platforms and aircraft.

<p>Townsley said Greenpeace could face a one million franc

($142,300) fine for defying the authorities while MV Greenpeace

captain John Castle might face up to six months in prison.

<p>Maritime officials, who sent a patrol boat to investigate,

said Greenpeace was breaking international and French law by

stopping, anchoring and diving near the pipe outlet.

<p>They said they would ``not start a naval battle'' but would

report back to the public prosecutor, who could impose a fine or

order the seizure of the Greenpeace boats.

<p>State-run nuclear fuels group Cogema, which owns the nuclear

fuel reprocessing plant at La Hague, said the radioactive waste

leaving the pipe was monitored before being dumped and met

existing standards on health and environmental impact.

<p>In a bid to dispel its secretive image, Cogema installed 10

permanent web cameras at its reprocessing site seven months ago

but it has not fixed a camera to the discharge pipe, located 30

meters under the sea in an area of fierce currents.

<p>``You can't see a lot because its deep under water and

changes in tides and currents make installing that kind of

material under water very difficult,'' a press official at the

company told Reuters, adding that photos of the discharge pipe

could be consulted on the company's internet site.

<p>Townsley said some eight OSPAR states favored a ban on all

sea dumping of nuclear waste but France and Britain, the only

countries outside Russia which still reprocess spent nuclear

fuel, were opposed. Twelve votes are needed to approve the ban.

<p>Cogema press officials were not immediately able to answer

allegations by Greenpeace that the plant had ignored a legally-

binding OSPAR commitment to significantly reduce the volume and

concentration of nuclear waste dumped in the sea by 2000.

<p>Greenpeace said on Saturday independent surveys showed 80

percent of Europeans opposed dumping nuclear waste in the sea.
