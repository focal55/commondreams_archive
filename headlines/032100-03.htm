<p>GENEVA -- U.S. jets used 31,000 depleted uranium rounds --



about 10 tons of the munitions -- during the Kosovo war, a U.N. task



force said Tuesday, citing confirmation by NATO.



<P>   Some specialists believe the rounds, which have been used as far



back as the Persian Gulf War, are environmentally harmful,



especially when people and animals inhale the dust that forms when



the shells disintegrate on impact.



<P>   Target zones hit by depleted uranium -- known as DU -- should be



marked and children kept away from them, said Pekka Haavisto, head



of the U.N. Environment Program's Balkans Task Force.



<P>   Haavisto said NATO's confirmation that it used DU should not



cause alarm, but conceded scientific knowledge of its effects is



limited. He said he was unable to estimate the number of people



exposed.



<P>   "I'm very happy that this spring we have got finally from NATO



the information, but we would have been more happy if we could have



had this information already last summer," Haavisto said.



<P>   A set of NATO maps of areas where the munitions were used "is



not precise enough to make field assessments," Haavisto said. He



noted that U.N. experts last year carried out measurements in



Kosovo, but found nothing because the exact locations were unknown.



<P>   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the ammunition's



use did not violate any international conventions.



<P>   In the past, the U.S. Defense Department has robustly defended



the use of depleted uranium -- a dense metal which provides enhanced



armor-piercing capability -- saying the rounds pose no more health



risk than conventional anti-tank weapons.



<P>   The U. N. task force said the World Health Organization was



preparing a general report on the health effects of depleted



uranium and that the Royal Society, Britain's academy of science,



was producing its own independent study.



<P>   NATO secretary-general Lord Robertson wrote to U.N.



Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb. 7, acknowledging that DU



rounds were used during last spring's air campaign against



Yugoslavia whenever American A-10 ground attack aircraft engaged



armored vehicles.



<P>   He said the ammunition was part of the planes' standard load,



meaning that they were used throughout Kosovo on about 100



missions.



<P>   The major focus of the operations was an area west of the



Pec-Dakovica-Prizren highway, in the areas surrounding Klina and



Prizren and north of a line between Suva Reka and Urosevac,



Robertson said. But he added that many missions used DU in other



areas.



<P>   The round, Robertson said, uses a byproduct of the uranium



refining process.
