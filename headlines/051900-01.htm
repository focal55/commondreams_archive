For years, the Paramount Television studio has been left out of the 

riches of daytime talk television as 

shows starring Oprah Winfrey and 

Rosie O'Donnell became wildly popular.



<p> So, last spring, top Paramount executives jumped at a chance to 

produce a talk show starring Dr. 

Laura Schlessinger, the conservative 

advice-giver whose radio show is the 

second-highest-rated talk show in the 

nation. They scheduled it for September and sold it to stations covering 96 

percent of the country.



<p>  But now they are facing an increasingly vociferous protest by gay 

advocacy groups, who are angered 

by what they say is Dr. Schlessinger's anti-gay message. And the 

protests are getting results.



<p>  This week, the nation's second-largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, announced that it was dropping 

plans to sponsor the TV show and 

would stop advertising on her radio 

program because of the controversy 

generated by the protests.



<p>  Yesterday, United Airlines, a unit 

of UAL, said it would not run any 

more advertisements for the radio 

show in its in-flight magazine. A 

week ago,  the Canadian Broadcast 

Standards Council issued a condemnation of Dr. Schlessinger's radio 

commentary and recommended that 

stations censor any anti-gay remarks by her.



<p>     Gay activists have complained 

about her descriptions of  homosexuality  as "deviant" and derivative of 

"biological error."



<p>  Dr. Schlessinger, who declined to 

be interviewed about the protest, has 

said in  articles and broadcast commentaries that her statements are 

being taken out of context. She has 

said that while she opposes homosexuality and a "gay activist agenda," 

she does not oppose gays.



<p> Paramount executives said they 

were standing behind the program, 

which they maintained would carry 

positive messages about family values and would not promote "hate, 

hurt or intolerance." 



<p> The reactions to the protests  reflect the growing political and economic clout of gays.



<p>      It has been far more common for 

mainstream marketers to listen to 

groups on the right like the American Family Association, which assert that they represent millions of 

consumers, than to those representing gays, a smaller segment.



<p> About the only time that advocates 

for gays have won a big, visible victory was two decades ago when their 

protests and boycott led Florida citrus commissioners to end an endorsement contract with the singer 

Anita Bryant.



<p> Boycott threats from conservatives have proved mostly powerless 

-- as when the sales of the Clorox 

Company a decade ago were unaffected by a boycott called by the 

family association for sponsoring 

shows with content it viewed as objectionable. 



<p> But the conservative organizations 

have achieved results by generating 

controversy about a TV series or 

individual episode that dissuaded 

marketers from buying commercial 

time in the first place, rather than 

withdrawing commercials they had 

already agreed to run. 



<p> That worked for two years to keep 

most mainstream advertisers off 

"N.Y.P.D. Blue" despite strong ratings in the initial two seasons; only 

after seeing how that large viewership kept watching the series week 

after week did large advertisers 

climb aboard.



<p> "Controversy is in general something advertisers want to avoid," 

said Howard Buford, president and 

chief executive at Prime Access in 

New York, an agency specializing in 

campaigns directed toward gays. 

"The idea of advertising is to pull 

people in, not drive people away, so 

when a topic is divisive or polarizing, 

you want to stay away."



<p> The reason advertisers would begin to listen to gays about what upsets them is a result, Mr. Buford 

said, of "the fact that there's a very 

different picture now of who is gay 

and what it means."



<p>       Robin Tyler, a gay who co-founded 

a Web site that has rallied opposition 

to the Dr. Schlessinger TV show 

(www.stopdrlaura.com), said one 

reason the anti-Schlessinger forces 

were gaining momentum so quickly 

 was that the Internet was enabling 

the organizers "to get out our messages instantly, reaching millions of 

us in our own communities."



<p>  Stopdrlaura.com was the brainchild of a small group of activists. 

But now, established gay and lesbian 

organizations like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation are 

marshaling their forces to join the 

fight.



<p>   Dr. Schlessinger has  said that 

while gays are "entitled to love and 

respect as are all human beings," 

homosexual activity is incompatible 

with Scripture. She has said she supports the concept of  therapy for gays 

who wish to change their sexual orientation. She supported a ballot  proposition in California that outlawed 

same-sex marriages.



<p>   The decision by Procter & Gamble, 

which  spends more than $2.6 billion a 

year in advertising for brands like 

Tide, Pampers and Crest, could lead 

to defections by other advertisers 

because the company is a pacesetter 

among the mass market advertisers 

that buy most of the commercial 

time during syndicated talk shows.



<p>  Paramount executives said yesterday that no other sponsors had pulled 

out. Despite trepidation expressed by 

some station managers, the executives said no local stations had 

moved to drop the show.



<p> The show is said to have offended 

employees at all levels of Paramount, and some of the studio's executives want it dropped. 



<p> The producer of "Frasier," David 

Lee, who is openly gay, said yesterday that he had repeatedly asked his 

studio to call off the show, but to no 

avail.
