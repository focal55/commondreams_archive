THE HAGUE <wbr>--<wbr> A U.N. conference on how to reduce emissions of the gases blamed

for global warming and freakish weather from California to the European

continent was gridlocked Thursday, with many environmentalists and

delegates casting the United States in the role of chief villain.

<p>"We have all concluded that the U.S. has brought these negotiations to

the brink of failure by seeking loophole after loophole," Philip Clapp,

president of the Washington-based National Environmental Trust, said at a

joint news conference organized by U.S. ecological groups.

<p>The Clinton administration's chief negotiator at the talks,

Undersecretary of State Frank Loy, has had a raspberry, chocolate and

cream cake thrown in his face by incensed protesters. On Thursday, about

200 American students from the environmental organization Greenpeace

showed up and announced that they were observing a Thanksgiving fast to

denounce their country's stance.

<p>"Thanksgiving is supposed to be a day to warm the heart, not the

atmosphere," said Alex Tapia, 21, of Austin, Texas.

<p>The U.N. conference on climate change, attended by the envoys of more

than 180 nations, is supposed to put teeth in the agreement reached three

years ago in Kyoto, Japan, to cut worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide

and other so-called greenhouse gases.

<p>Those gases, accumulating in the atmosphere, are causing the planet to

heat up. They are seen by many scientists as the cause of melting

glaciers, rising sea levels and an increase in storms--from record rains

in Santa Barbara two years ago to the mighty storm that felled trees by

the millions in France last December.

<p>The goal subscribed to in Kyoto was to reduce global emissions of

greenhouse gases to 5.2% below 1990 levels by 2012. Delegates meeting

here since last week have proved incapable of agreeing on key issues,

including to what degree countries should be allowed to take credit for

forests and farmland that soak up carbon dioxide, rather than taking

additional steps to reduce output of the heat-trapping gases.

<p>"There has been progress, but not enough," Jan Pronk, environmental

minister of the Netherlands and chairman of the conference, said

Thursday. "There has been a greater divergence of opinion than could have

been expected."

<p>"I will make suggestions which may cause pain, which will cause pain,

but there will be a sharing of pain as evenly as possible," the Dutchman

announced. He said he is determined to wind up the meeting by Saturday,

one day later than originally scheduled.

<p>The main onus of the so-called Kyoto Protocol falls on the

industrialized nations that burn much of the world's oil, coal and other

fossil fuels. The United States, generator of a quarter of the planet's

greenhouse gases--more than any other country--is supposed to cut its

emissions by 7% from the 1990 benchmark. Europe is supposed to reduce its

output by 8%, and Japan by 6%.

<p>In a sense, because of the U.S. economic boom, those numbers are

misleading. Because of the full-bore growth of the economy in recent

years, U.S. officials estimate that their country would have to slash its

greenhouse gas emissions by 35% from current levels.

<p>To meet that obligation, the U.S. insists on taking advantage of the

full panoply of possibilities that it says was enshrined at Kyoto. That

includes a trading mechanism that would allow a noncomplying country to

purchase "credits" from another nation that meets or exceeds its

gas-reduction obligations. In effect, Americans would then be buying from

Belgians or Botswanans the right to pollute.

<p>"To meet the target, we need all of the tools we took on at Kyoto,"

one official on the 150-member U.S. delegation explained Thursday. "The

atmosphere doesn't care whether you're getting a reduction in gas from

Russia or Paris."

<p>Outraged environmentalists see that strategy as an attempt by a

wealthy, powerful nation to buy its way out of its commitments. According

to Clapp, the U.S. approach would allow it to meet 84% of its obligations

through "loopholes that don't represent any reductions of emissions into

the atmosphere."

<p>Bill Nye, an American who hosts a popular television program on

science and a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, came to The

Hague to use an aquarium, vinegar and baking powder to demonstrate to

reporters how carbon dioxide retains heat and to urge his country to heed

the concerns of others.

<p>"If the U.S. can take that extra step, I think we can go forward

and--dare I say it--change the world," said Nye, a mechanical engineer.

<p>Many Europeans also have been dismayed at the U.S. position.

<p>"We have been left aghast at the lack of the meeting of minds between

us as Europeans and the United States," said Chris Davies, a British

member of the European Parliament. On Monday, French President Jacques

Chirac made the trip from Paris to this Dutch seaside city to demand that

the United States do more.

<p>"Each American emits three times more greenhouse gases than a

Frenchman," Chirac said. "It is in the Americans, in the first place,

that we place our hopes of effectively limiting greenhouse gas emissions

on a global scale."

<p>For many influential Americans, though, jobs are at least as important

as scaling back carbon dioxide releases into the atmosphere. Already, the

Senate has passed a resolution making its approval of any treaty

commitment on reducing global emissions contingent on a guarantee that

the pact would not harm the competitiveness of U.S. business.

<p>"What we want is a way that makes it work without penalizing the

economies of the world and our economy," Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho)

told reporters during a visit to The Hague this week.

<p>In search of compromise, the American delegation volunteered to reduce

the emissions credits that the U.S. or any other nation could derive from

its forests and farmland, which soak up carbon dioxide.

<p>Despite the dearth of progress, U.S. delegates said the conference in

The Hague seemed to be moving from a phase of inflexible public posturing

to genuine dealing. Jokingly pleading with any more cake-throwers in the

audience to spare him because he was wearing his last clean suit, Loy

produced a Thanksgiving metaphor.

<p>"It's time to talk turkey," the undersecretary of State for global

affairs said at a Thursday evening news briefing. "And I'm pleased to say

that we are now talking turkey in this conference."

<p>Dominique Voynet, France's environment minister and head of the

15-nation European Union contingent here, also was upbeat, saying the

mood of the meeting had changed from one of collective depression to a

willingness to engage in hard-nosed bargaining.

<p>"Everything can either split apart or solidify," she said. "We are now

testing ideas that we never thought of before."
