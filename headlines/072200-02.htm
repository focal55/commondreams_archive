AMERICA was on a collision course with the rest of the world yesterday after saying that its economic boom has been so great that it cannot achieve its commitment to tackle global warming under the 1997 Kyoto Treaty by cutting fuel use.

<p>



Frank Loy, who will be its senior negotiator at the autumn climate change talks, said in London that economic growth meant that the seven per cent cut America had agreed to make by 2010 was "a tougher task" than other countries faced. Mr Loy, Under-Secretary of State, global affairs, spoke after Nasa scientists said that the Greenland ice sheet was melting at a rate of about 12 cubic miles a year, accounting for seven per cent of sea level rise worldwide.

<p>



Mr Loy ensured the opposition of the EU and the developing world by saying that America needed to trade its emissions cut with developing and developed nations. He also refused to accept any figure of how much of its target it should meet at home. "We should not put any constraint on our ability to achieve that, when the Earth does not care whether it is taken here or there."

<p>



America has found it politically impossible to impose a single cent in tax on the price of petrol. It would need to trade its emissions cut with Russia, and even the Third World, to achieve it. One of the financial mechanisms to be discussed at this autumn's talks is a proposal to let America pay Kenya to switch from coal to less-polluting gas.

<p>



China has agreed to emissions trading, with America supplying cleaner power stations in return for an audited cut in carbon it can put against its own target. America also wants to include the planting of trees, and other "sinks" which soak up emissions, within the climate treaty in the autumn negotiations.

<p>



The EU is insisting on all developed nations making half their agreed cuts at home, but Mr Loy said that America saw "zero justification" in putting a limit on the amount achieved by trading. Mr Loy said his government was in favour of adding the cuts which a country had failed to make in the last round on to the cuts it would have to make in the next one.

<p>



Countries might have to pay a fine into a clean development fund if they failed to meet their commitments under the legally-binding Kyoto Treaty. Sanctions are one of the subjects to be agreed in the autumn. The Senate decided at the time of the Kyoto Treaty that it would not ratify the protocol if it damaged the economy and if it did not bind in the developing world. 

<p>



Developing countries, led by China and India, say that the industrialised world, which is responsible for most of the emissions, should act first. Mr Loy said that the political atmosphere in America had changed significantly since then. There was a growing recognition among people and among leading companies that the science of climate change was hardening up and they needed to do something about it.

<p>



"I can't underestimate the importance of that mindset. Companies of size and influence have an influence beyond their immediate companies. They change the political atmosphere."

<p>



The Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions said: "Mr Loy is putting forward a hard negotiating position. We have to be sure that the trading is for things that wouldn't have happened anyway."
