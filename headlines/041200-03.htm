A federal judge in San Francisco yesterday rebuffed an effort by 

the Clinton administration to relax standards for ``dolphin safe'' labeling 

on tuna.

<P>  Several environmental groups had filed suit in August after Commerce 

Secretary William Daley proposed a change in the standard for labeling tuna 

``dolphin safe,'' which had been reserved for tuna caught without any 

chasing and netting of dolphins.	 

</P>

<P>  Daley ruled in April 1999 that there was insufficient evidence that 

dolphin populations are adversely effected by large encircling nets used by 

tuna fisherman. Environmentalists have long objected to the use of such 

nets, which tend to harass and ensnare dolphins, which are swimming above 

and feeding on tuna.	 

</P>

<P>  In ruling against the administration yesterday, U.S. District Judge 

Thelton Henderson said Daley ``acted contrary to the law and abused his 

discretion when he triggered a change in the `dolphin safe' label 

standard.''	 

</P>

<P>  David Phillips, director of the international Marine Mammal Project at 

Earth Island Institute, one of the environmental groups, called the ruling a 

``tremendous rebuke'' of the administration and other officials ``who sold 

out dolphin protections to accommodate a handful of foreign fishing 

companies.''	 

</P>

<P>  A spokesperson for the Commerce Department could not be reached to 

respond to the ruling.	 

</P>

<P>  Environmental groups have waged a long battle against fishermen in the 

eastern, tropical Pacific who use the encircling nets, known as purse seine 

nets, to capture tuna swimming below dolphins.	 

</P>

<P>  The environmentalists claimed that Daley's decision to loosen the 

standards was politically motivated to allow fishing fleets in Mexico and 

other Latin American countries to sell tuna that has been banned in the 

United States since 1990, when the ``dolphin safe'' label was adopted.	 

</P>

<P>  In yesterday's ruling, Henderson found that Daley abused his discretion 

because he failed to provide research data to support a change in the 

labeling standard. A law passed by Congress requires the Commerce Department 

to back up labeling changes with evidence that the use of nets was not 

harmful to the dolphin population.	 

</P>

<P>  The Commerce Department responded that it could not take samples from 

dead dolphins because of a lack of cooperation from the foreign tuna fleets.	 

</P>

<P>  But Henderson did not buy that argument. ``The record, however, makes it 

clear that Mexico was more than willing to cooperate in the necropsy 

research,'' the judge wrote in his decision.
