WASHINGTON  - Corporate power keeps growing and

growing. That's

the

message of a new report released here Monday by the left-wing

Institute

for Policy Studies, one year after anti-corporate demonstrators

and

self-described ''anarchists'' stalled World Trade Organisation

(WTO)

negotiations in Seattle.

<P>

The report, the latest in a series of annual studies on corporate

size

produced

by the Institute, notes that, of the world's 100 largest economic

entities, 51 are corporations and only 49 were countries measured

by annual

corporate sales and annual gross domestic product (GDP). 

<P>

Moreover, the world's 200 largest corporations have combined sales

greater

than the combined GDP of all countries but the world's 10 largest

economies

and

18 times greater than the combined annual income of the roughly 25

percent of

the world's population living on less than one dollar per day. 

<P>

Nor does it appear that all of these economic activity necessarily

provide

proportional benefits to these companies' workers. The profits of

the 200

largest companies - 82 of which are US based - grew 362.4 percent

over the

16 years between 1983 and 1999, according to the Institute, while

the

number of

people they employed grew by only 14.4 percent. 

<P>

And while their sales amounted to the equivalent of about 27.5

percent of

global GDP in 1999, the number of people employed by them directly

amounted

to only 14.4 percent of the global workforce, according to the

report. 

<P>

Its publication comes at a time of growing popular concern here

about

corporate power, illustrated most recently by a special feature

appearing in

the Sep. 11 edition of the influential Business Week magazine. The

article,

entitled 'Too Much Corporate Power?', found that, despite the

longest

period of economic expansion in US history, the US public was

increasingly

uneasy about corporate influence on their lives and communities. 

<P>

While almost half of respondents in a major poll sponsored by the

weekly

magazine and conducted by the Louis Harris polling organisation,

agreed with

the notion that what is good for business is good for most of the

citizenry,

two-thirds of those polled thought that large profits were more

important to

big companies than developing safe and reliable, quality products

for

consumers. 

<P>

It also found that the so-called ''New Economy'' of hi-tech and

information

companies - which have recently suffered serious setbacks in the

stock

market - are leaving workers and their families ''feeling

overworked and

stressed out''. 

<P>

And about three out of four respondents agreed that big companies

have too

much influence over ''government policy, politicians, and policy-

makers in

Washington''. 

<P>

''It's no longer a youth or hippie thing,'' the article stated.

''Today,

those angry at business come from all parts of US society.'' 

<P>

That sense helps explain the decision by Vice President Al Gore to

run a

quasi-populist campaign - in which he strongly assailed tobacco,

oil, health

insurance, and pharmaceutical companies - in the presidential

elections, a

decision which caught many by surprise given his own history of

friendliness

both to corporations and their political campaign contributions. 

<P>

For this year's campaign, according to the Institute, the 82 US

companies on

the Top 200 list made direct contributions to candidates through

political

action committees totalling more than 30 million dollars, not

counting many

times more that amount made in so-called ''soft-money'' donations

to parties

or interest groups directly involved in the campaign. 

<P>

Overall, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,

corporations

outspent

labour unions 15 to one during this year's campaign. 

<P>

''The growing private power has enormous economic consequences,''

the report

states. ''However, the greatest impact may be political, as

corporations

transform economic clout into political power. As a result,

democracy is

undermined. This threat deserves to be one of the major issues on

the

political agenda.'' 

<P>

At the same time that they wield enormous political power in

Washington,

companies have been successful in resisting government or public-

interest

efforts to make their foreign operations more transparent,

according to the

Institute. Among information that US firms which do business

abroad are not

required to make public are data about the number of workers they

employ in

each country, the amount of toxic gases their plants emit into the

atmosphere;

the location of their plants or contractors; and their wage rates. 

<P>

Their influence is also illustrated by the extent to which they

avoid paying

taxes both here and abroad. One study by the Institute of Taxation

and

Economic Policy found that 44 of the 82 biggest US companies

failed to pay

the full standard 35-percent corporate tax rate during the period

1996-98,

while seven - Texaco, Chevron, PepsiCo, Enron, Worldcom, McKesson,

and

General Motors - of them actually received rebates that exceeded

the amount

of taxes they paid during that time. 

<P>

The liberal use of tax havens abroad has also reduced US corporate

tax

liability for overseas operations far below the rates at which

their foreign

profits have grown, according to the report. 

<P>

The 82 US firms among the world's top 200, as determined by

Fortune Magazine,

represent a substantial increase over 1995, when only 59 of the

top 200 were

US-based. At that time, Japan was a close second with 58, but,

with the

continuing effects of its long recession, Japanese firms now  

account for only 

41 of the 200 largest. 

<P>

The world's six largest companies as defined by 1999 sales are  

General Motors, 

Wal-Mart, Exxon, Mobil, Ford Motor, and the German company Daimler  

Chrysler in that order. As economic entities, they rate, 23, 25,  

26, 27 and  

28, respectively, behind the GDPs of the major western  

industrialised  

powers, China, Brazil, Mexico, India, South Korea, Russia, and  

Argentina. 

<P>

The world's biggest private employer in 1999 was Wal-Mart, whose  

global  

workforce has skyrocketed from 62,000 in 1983 to 1,140,000 last  

year. The  

report notes that while the retail chain, which has been expanding 

aggressively 

in Latin America, has undoubtedly created new-job opportunities  

for tens of 

thousands of workers, it remains ''notorious'' for its anti-union  

efforts and 

heavy reliance on part-time employees to whom it is not required  

to pay health 

or other benefits.
