GAZA   - The United States was ready to create a

$30 billion refugee compensation fund if Palestinian President

Yasser Arafat agreed to compromise on key issues at the Camp

David summit, a senior PLO official said on Thursday.

<p>Selim al-Zanoun, who heads the Palestine Liberation

Organization's parliament-in-exile and mini-parliament, said

Arafat refused the offer during last month's Camp David peace

summit which was hosted by President Clinton.

<p>A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv declined

comment.

<p>``The Americans offered to give the Palestinians $30 billion

for a compensation fund to tempt us to cede the rights of the

refugees,'' Zanoun told a news conference in Gaza.

<p>He said the compensation would be divided between

Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced to flee their

homes in 1948, when Israel was created, and Jewish refugees who

fled Arab countries after Israel was established.

<p>Zanoun said the other condition attached to the $30 billion

offer was that Arafat must agree to compromise over Jerusalem.

<p>``The American pressure at Camp David took two forms --

threats and the gestures made by some Zionists in the American

administration,'' Zanoun said. ``President Arafat rejected the

enticements and the threats.''

<p>A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv said the

United States would not comment on proposals tabled at the

summit and added that Clinton said after the summit collapsed

that everything discussed at the peace talks was null and void.

<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967

Middle East war and, in a move not recognized internationally,

has long regarded all of Jerusalem as its ``united and eternal

capital.'' The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital

of a future independent state.

<p>Some reports suggest Prime Minister Ehud Barak broke away

from that long-standing Israeli position by agreeing to give

Palestinians sovereignty over outlying parts of the city.

<p>Clinton indirectly blamed Arafat for the failure of the

summit, saying the Palestinian leader had shown less

flexibility than Barak. Some Palestinian officials have

criticized Clinton over his comments.
