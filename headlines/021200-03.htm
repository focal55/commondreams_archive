<p>JERUSALEM - An Israeli soldier killed in south Lebanon yesterday by Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces was almost certainly a casualty of an American missile supplied to Iran by Israel. More than 2,000 of the Tow anti-tank weapons were handed over in 1986 as part of the Iran-Contra deal engineered by Ronald Reagan aides Robert McFarlane and Oliver North.

<p>Intelligence sources said yesterday that the missiles were sent to Hezbollah via Syria in the past two months. They have been used to devastating effect against Israeli outposts in what Tel Aviv calls its "security zone", a ten-mile wide strip of land inside Lebanon. The soldier killed yesterday - two were wounded in the attack on Beaufort Castle army base - was the seventh in less than three weeks. Shortly 

afterwards, Israeli warplanes struck positions near by. 

<P>

Israeli officials also stormed out of a US-sponsored meeting of international monitors aimed at halting the escalating violence in south Lebanon. Calling the Hezbollah action "particularly egregious", James Rubin, the US State Department spokesman, said in Washington: "We can only interpret the event as a deliberate attempt by Hezbollah to wreck the prospects for peace in the region." At least four of the Israelis killed in recent days are believed 

to be victims of Tow missiles, which have a range of 1.5 miles, further than the Soviet-made Saggar that Hezbollah has used in the past. Earlier this week, a Hezbollah guerrilla party managed to film one of the missile attacks. It showed an Israeli outpost evaporating when it was hit by the armour piercing missile  to destroy the world's most sophisticated tanks.

<P>

 Mr McFarlane, interviewed on a skiing break, said: "You'll remember that the Israelis pushed that deal. What a historic irony." It is an irony not lost on the Israeli public, which has lost enthusiasm for the Lebanese quagmire dubbed "our very own Vietnam".  Opinion polls this week showed that 56 per cent of Israelis wanted a withdrawal from Lebanon.
