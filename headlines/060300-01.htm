SACRAMENTO<wbr> - <wbr>A state senator Friday called for a new hearing on a $4-million

request by the California Highway Patrol to pay for crowd control at the

Democratic National Convention, while the head of the CHP said he was

surprised to learn about some of the items included in the budget

request.

<p>D.O. "Spike" Helmick said a two-page request for crowd control

equipment that is part of the $4 million came from the Los Angeles Police

Department, and that when he appeared before a Senate budget committee

two weeks ago seeking the money, he believed it was primarily for

personnel and some equipment. He was not aware of what the equipment was,

he said.

<p>"This is clearly a list submitted to us by LAPD," Helmick said Friday

after being shown a detailed listing of the LAPD's request.

<p>The list includes a paper shredder and mountain climbing equipment, as

well as pepper spray and tear gas and guns to launch the canisters.

<p>Law enforcement officials have expressed concerns that the convention,

to be held in Los Angeles, could be the site of protests like those

earlier this year in Seattle and Washington. Some have warned that there

could be terrorist attacks.

<p>However, Helmick said little of the equipment appears vital to the

CHP's main mission during the convention: keeping freeways open and

ensuring that dignitaries can get to and from the convention safely.

<p>"I haven't got a clue why they would ask for that [paper shredder],"

Helmick said. "I will find out."

<p>A Los Angeles police spokeswoman said she was unaware of the

rationale. "We're directing all calls about that to the CHP. They're the

ones handling it," Capt. Sharyn Buck said Friday.

<p>The list also includes gas guns that shoot beanbag-like projectiles

used to control demonstrators.

<p>The CHP budget request includes bomb detection equipment and

protective vests, plus 39 video cameras and 39 bolt and pipe cutters used

to dislodge protesters who chain themselves to poles.

<p>The CHP and LAPD are among the law enforcement agencies represented in

regular planning meetings for the convention. But Helmick said he does

not know why the LAPD requisition list was given to the CHP, why many of

the items were included or why state money is being sought.

<p>"They're clearly going to have to explain it, or the question will be

revisited, I can assure you," Helmick said.

<p>Helmick said that as far as he is concerned, none of the material will

be "utilized unless it is absolutely necessary. These folks have a right

to be heard."

<p>The CHP's request is one of thousands buried in the $100-billion

spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. It attracted Sen.

Tom Hayden's attention because he sits on a budget subcommittee that

oversees the CHP, and because of his history of being put on trial for

leading protests at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago.

<p>The Los Angeles Democrat said the police request suggests they will

overreact to protesters at the convention in Los Angeles, and he wrote a

letter Friday calling on the Legislature's budget committee to reopen

discussions about the $4-million item.

<p>"The request was made in a way that smacks of being covert," Hayden

said.
