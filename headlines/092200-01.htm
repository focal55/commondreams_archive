The dozen states that have chosen not to enact the death penalty 

since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that it was constitutionally 

permissible have not had higher homicide rates than states with the death 

penalty, statistics and analysis show.	 

<P>  Indeed, 10 of the 12 states without capital punishment have homicide 

rates below the national average, FBI data shows, while half the states with 

the death penalty have homicide rates above the national average. A 

state-by-state analysis found that during the last 20 years, the homicide 

rate in states with the death penalty has been 48 percent to 101 percent 

higher than in states without the death penalty.	 

</P><P>  The Times study also found that homicide rates have risen and fallen 

along roughly symmetrical paths in the states with and without the death 

penalty, suggesting to many experts that the threat of the death penalty 

rarely deters criminals.	 

</P><P>  ``It is difficult to make the case for any deterrent effect from these 

numbers,'' said Steven Messner, a criminologist at the State University of 

New York at Albany, who reviewed the analysis. ``Whatever the factors are 

that affect change in homicide rates, they don't seem to operate differently 

based on the presence or absence of the death penalty in a state.''	 

</P><P>  That is one of the arguments most frequently made against capital 

punishment in states without the death penalty -- that and the assertion 

that it is difficult to mete out fairly. Opponents also maintain that it is 

too expensive to prosecute and that life without parole is a more efficient 

form of punishment.	 

</P><P>  Prosecutors and officials in states that have the death penalty are as 

passionate as in states that don't. While they recognize that it is 

difficult to make the case for deterrence, they contend that there are 

powerful reasons to carry out executions. Rehabilitation is ineffective, 

they argue, and capital punishment is often the only penalty that matches 

the heinousness of the crimes committed. Furthermore, they say, society has 

a right to retribution, and the finality of an execution can bring closure 

to victims' families.	 

</P><P>  Polls indicate that these are the views held by most people. And 

certainly, most states have death penalty statutes. Twelve states have 

chosen otherwise, but their experiences have been largely overlooked in 

recent discussions about capital punishment.	 

</P><P>  ``I think Michigan made a wise decision 150 years ago,'' said the state's 

Republican governor, John Engler. Michigan abolished the death penalty in 

1846 and has resisted attempts to reinstate it. ``We're pretty proud of the 

fact that we don't have the death penalty,'' Engler said, adding that he is 

opposed to the death penalty on moral and pragmatic grounds.	 

</P><P>  Engler said he is not swayed by polls that show 60 percent of Michigan 

residents favor the death penalty. He said 100 percent would like not to pay 

taxes.	 

</P><P>  In addition to Michigan, and its Midwestern neighbors Iowa, Minnesota, 

North Dakota and Wisconsin, the states without the death penalty are Alaska, 

Hawaii, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts, where 

an effort to reinstate it was narrowly defeated last year.	 

</P><P>  The homicide rate in North Dakota, which does not have the death penalty, 

was lower than the homicide rate in South Dakota, which does have it, 

according to FBI statistics for 1998. Massachusetts, which abolished capital 

punishment in 1984, has a lower rate than Connecticut, which has six people 

on death row; the homicide rate in West Virginia is 30 percent below that of 

Virginia, which has one of the highest execution rates in the country.	 

</P><P>  Other factors affect homicide rates, of course, including unemployment 

and demographics, as well as the amount of money spent on police, 

prosecutors and prisons.	 

</P><P>  But the analysis found that the demographic profile of states with the 

death penalty is not far different from that of states without it. The 

poverty rate in states with the death penalty, as a whole, was 13.4 percent 

in 1990, compared with 11.4 percent in states without the death penalty.	 

</P><P>  Of the current death row population across the country, 43 percent are 

African Americans, according to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 

Inc.

BC:	

  THE DEATH PENALTY AND HOMICIDE RATES	 

  Homicide rates in states with the death penalty are higher than in 

those without, and have shown similar up-and-down trends over the 

years, offering little support to the contention that capital punishment is 

a deterrent.
