<p>GENEVA - Amnesty International criticized the United States today for increasingly brutal police measures against crime suspects, saying the use of pepper spray and stunning devices as punishment constitutes torture. 



<p>The London-based human rights group presented a report to the U.N. Committee Against Torture, which meets Wednesday to consider the U.S. record for the first time since Washington ratified a convention outlawing torture in 1994.

Since then, the "increasingly punitive approach toward offenders [in the United States] has continued to lead to practices which facilitate torture or other forms of ill-treatment," Amnesty said. U.S. officials in Geneva for the session had no immediate comment. 



<p>In the 45-page report, the London-based human rights group cited long-term isolation for prisoners and incarceration of asylum-seekers in "cruel and degrading conditions." It said the rising prison population contributed to widespread ill-treatment of inmates and that police brutality is particularly directed at racial and ethnic minorities. 



<p><b>Pepper spray, stun belts cited</b>



<p>Amnesty pointed to the use of pepper spray, tear gas and electric-shock devices and noted in particular the use of pepper spray against demonstrators protesting at meetings of the World Trade Organization and other events in recent months. 



<p>It said there are reports of police officers dousing suspects with spray as a form of "street justice" after they had already been restrained. At the WTO protests in Seattle in November and December, protesters accused police of swabbing pepper gel or foam into their eyes while they were in custody, the report said. 



<p>Amnesty also cited the use of stun belts, which are placed around a prisoner's waist and can apply shocks. It said 100 U.S. jurisdictions have acquired stun belts, citing one example where a prisoner was given an electric shock in open court by order of the judge. 



<p>"As with other international human rights treaties, the United States' respect for the Convention against torture is only halfhearted when applied to itself," it said. 



<p><b>'Abuses' acknowledged</b>



<p>In its report to the committee made public last year, the United States said cases of torture are rare, but it conceded that "abuses occur despite the best precautions and the strictest prohibitions." 



<p>It assured the panel that torture is a criminal offense in the United States and that perpetrators are prosecuted and victims entitled to compensation. The federal government also may take civil action against police misconduct under a 1994 law. 



<p>"Every unit of government at every level within the United States is committed, by law as well as by policy, to the protection of the individual's life, liberty and physical integrity," the report said.
