Never had Trevor Buchanan faced a ballot measure so deeply

personal.

<p>Proposition 36 was not only about policy, it was about the ordeal of

his older brother, a recovering cocaine addict. It was about people

Buchanan knew--six altogether--imprisoned for drug abuse and related

crimes. It was about the neighborhood where he grew up, a well-to-do

quarter of San Diego where you might never expect so many users.

<p>"Where there's money to buy it, it's even worse," Buchanan said of the

problem. "It's everywhere."

<p>The 22-year-old university student was part of the tide of

California's young and old, from cities, suburbs and hinterlands, who

voted for a dramatic shift in how government handles nonviolent drug

offenders.

<p>Proposition 36 passed with a resounding 61% of the vote. It provides

$120 million a year to channel users into treatment programs, rather than

into jails and prisons. Graduates of such programs could have their

convictions erased; those who flunk could still land in prison.

<p>To many, the message of the extraordinary measure was clear: Old

policies are not working. It is time, voters said, to circumvent the

politicians and rethink the idea that addicts are criminals. Using speed

or smoking crack is not necessarily the province of dangerous men on

urban street corners; it is a problem afflicting families of every social

stratum.

<p>There is no telling where it will strike next--maybe your wife, your

cousin, your father.

<p>"Locking people up for drugs--for an illness many of them can't

control--is just primitive," said Rita Lowenthal, 73, of Santa Monica,

whose son battled addiction. "What are we going to do, lock everybody up?

All our sons and daughters? Where is it going to stop?

<p>"It's amazing and shameful that our country is still doing it.

Basically, I think the war on drugs is a big, fat failure."

<p>Bobbi Jones, 60, of Los Angeles watched a younger brother become

involved with marijuana and cocaine. Family members "jumped in with tough

love," she said, and took turns accompanying him to a treatment center

that straightened him out.

<p>That was 10 years ago. He's still clean and holding a job, Jones said,

but she hates to imagine how his life would have been changed by prison.

<p>"There wasn't anybody in prison to help him except other drug users

and dealers who would say, 'When you get out, come see me,' " she said.

"Most people using drugs or dealing drugs have low self-esteem. Why put

them in prison? Why not give them the help they need?"

<p>Prison overcrowding has been an unwelcome side effect of the costly

war on drugs. Nationwide, drugs and drug-related offenses now account for

about one-third of all arrests, more than any other category of crime,

the FBI reports.

<p>The federal drug-fighting budget has soared from $1 billion in 1980 to

nearly $18 billion a year, in addition to the $20 billion or so spent by

state and local governments.

<p>The crackdown has been especially notable in California. More people

are incarcerated here for simple drug possession than in any other state,

both per capita and in total numbers.

<p>California's prison system now bulges with 162,000 inmates. One in

three is there because of drugs. Eight in 10 have a history of substance

abuse, according to the Department of Corrections. And overwhelmingly

they are African Americans and Latinos.

<p>Outrage over those numbers--and the continuing drug problem--motivated

three wealthy businessmen to introduce Proposition 36. Before launching

the $2.8-million campaign, insurance magnate Peter Lewis, financier

George Soros and John Sperling, founder of the University of Phoenix,

conducted a statewide poll.

<p>They found that only 11% of respondents considered the drug war a

success; 65% preferred treatment over prison for nonviolent drug

offenders. A Los Angeles Times poll in October found an even larger

sentiment for treatment.

<p>"The drug war is a colossal failure, and everybody knows it except the

politicians," Sperling said in an interview from Arizona. Actually, he

added, "the politicians probably know it too but they . . . figure if

they do anything to stop the madness, they would be seen as soft on

crime."

<b><br>

<p>Support Came From All Regions

</b>

<p>The measure passed despite California's status as one of the leading

tough-on-crime states. Legislators here have stiffened penalties for drug

criminals, expanded the death penalty, pioneered "three strikes"

sentencing and funded $5 billion worth of new prison construction.

<p>The proposition's support came from liberal and conservative

communities alike, although it had much less support in the Central

Valley.

<p>In San Francisco, where proponents were predictably strong,

stockbroker Don Ashton, 36, said what's the big deal: "Are you kidding?

Why should you go to jail? Everybody uses drugs now and then."

<p>Marketing analyst Ann Bouton, 30, said only the poor do prison time

now. "Anyone with money," she said, "[hires] a lawyer and gets

probation."

<p>In conservative Orange County, where the measure passed with 60.7% of

the vote, there was a feeling that existing laws haven't worked, prison

construction is expensive and government needs to try a less punitive

approach.

<p>"There is a change in the mood here and nationwide," said Shirley

Grindle, a community activist. "This country wastes . . . a lot of money

in the war on drugs."

<p>A 64-year-old voter named Tom, from the tiny wine country town of

Napa, also cited financial considerations in supporting the measure. He

called himself a conservative who hates to commit more tax dollars to

anything. But allowing addicts to languish in prison may be far more

costly than paying for treatment, he figured.

<p>"You throw somebody in prison, he's not going to be cured--and who

knows what's going to happen two days after he hits the street again?"

said Tom, who declined to give his last name because he belongs to

Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>His own two sons, both successful professionals, went through

treatment programs after becoming addicted to speed. One has been clean

only eight months.

<p>"I bet there isn't anybody, for God's sakes, who doesn't know

somebody" whose life is affected, Tom said.

<p>Many of today's voters grew up during a time, the 1960s, when drug use

lost much of its stigma. Users were no longer ostracized as "dope

fiends." They were celebrated at Woodstock. The likes of Timothy Leary

and Jim Morrison became cultural icons, and it was considered cool in

some circles to experiment with even LSD and heroin.

<p>Today's teenagers, the offspring of that generation, also grew up in

an age of tolerance. In some surveys, 30% to 40% of high school students

acknowledge smoking marijuana. Some teens say it is no worse than

drinking beer.

<p>"Certainly, among young people, drug use is up," said Lynn McCormack,

principal of Mira Costa High, a top-rated school in affluent Manhattan

Beach, which nonetheless continues to grapple with student drug abuse.

<p>McCormack blamed peer pressure, stresses at home, ready spending

money, and the easy availability of drugs--especially marijuana--for the

upsurge.

<p>There is less stigma now, but parents are still alarmed when told that

a son or daughter has been caught with drugs, she said. They react mainly

by looking for help, not punishment.

<p>"I don't think I've ever seen a parent who wasn't shocked when they

received a call," McCormack said. "They're often in tears and they

struggle to understand it. But once they get beyond the moment . . . the

focus is, 'What are we going to do about this? How are we going to keep

this from happening again?' "

<p>A student might be suspended for a few days, but the counseling and

rehabilitation go on for many weeks, she said. The emphasis is on

fairness and solving the underlying problems that caused the student to

turn to drugs--attitudes undoubtedly reflected in the support for

Proposition 36, she said.

<p>"For me, as an educator, I would never think incarceration in terms of

drugs," said McCormack, who has three grown children. "I fully supported

that measure."

<b><br>

<p>Doctors' Attitudes Also Changed

</b>

<p>Attitudes in the medical community also have changed. Ten years ago,

many doctors did not know how to deal with a patient with a substance

problem, said Dr. Drew Pinsky, a well-known addiction specialist at Las

Encinas Hospital in Pasadena.

<p>Now, referrals to treatment programs are almost automatic; 12-step

groups have grown by staggering numbers.

<p>"Doctors are tuned in now," he said. "There's no longer the draconian

notion that [drug abuse] is a willful process that bad people engage in.

It's a disease that has a treatment, and the treatment is effective. It's

about time we behave accordingly."

<p>Dr. Gary Jaeger, incoming president of the California Society of

Addiction Medicine, agreed, saying drug abuse, like alcoholism, is now

regarded as a brain disorder.

<p>"It makes as much sense to put [addicts] in prison as it did to lock

up schizophrenics 100 years ago," he said.

<p>That so many actors, athletes and other celebrities have abused drugs,

only to be given second chances, may also have influenced public

attitudes toward rehabilitation, some experts believe.

<p>Untold thousands of fans have followed the travails of actors Charlie

Sheen and Robert Downey Jr., baseball star Darryl Strawberry and others.

<p>Retired jazz performer Buddy Arnold, now 74, who served time in prison

and beat a heroin addiction that lasted 31 years, now runs the

Hollywood-based Musicians Assistance Program, providing treatment for

addicts in the music industry.

<p>"I imagine some people might be resentful" of celebrities who often

get a break and avoid jail time, Arnold said.

<p>Maybe they figure, "If the star can get away with it, the common man

should be given a shot," Arnold said. "You should not have people doing

10 years for a joint, which actually happens."
