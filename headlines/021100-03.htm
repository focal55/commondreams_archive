Ignore it and maybe it will go away. In large part that seems to be the

attitude of our society toward the reality of breast cancer. Sure, there

are 5K races to support research, and pink ribbons to be pinned on

supporter's lapels, but when it comes to the cold, hard reality of

mastectomies, radiation, chemotherapy and often death, there are few

places the American public comes face-to-face with the killer. That is,

unless they know one of the one in nine women who will develop the

disease in her lifetime. And though that's not unlikely, even then many

remain unaware of the ravages of the disease.</P>

<P>A billboard campaign targeted at changing that has been the subject of

controversy in the last few weeks. The three posters, designed to look

like a Cosmopolitan magazine cover, a Victoria's Secret catalogue and a

Calvin Klein perfume ad, feature topless models striking the usual

come-hither pose -- but with a twist. In place of voluptuous breasts the

models sport scars. Mastectomy scars.</P>

<P>The posters were scheduled to go up in 57 bus shelters in San Francisco

and in surrounding Contra Costa, Santa Clara and Napa counties. But in

that liberal, anything-goes City By the Bay someone suddenly grew a

prudish conscience and decided citizens' eyes needed to be shielded from

the realities of breast cancer. Outdoor Systems, the company that

contracts with San Francisco for exclusive rights to advertise on city

bus shelters, backed out of donating space for the ads after seeing the

final product.</P>

<P>Ironically, the posters did go up in more conservative parts of the Bay

Area, though fewer than 20 currently remain on display. (Most were taken

down due to citizen's complaints, though the total number of upset

citizens who were able to topple the posters in Santa Clara County was

said to be four.)</P>

<P>Lew Lillian, head of Outdoor Systems, made the decision to keep the ads

out of San Franciscans' sight.</P>

<P>"To see a woman's terribly, terribly scarred body -- it's just not for

public consumption on the streets of San Francisco...where children and

others can be traumatized," Lillian told the San Francisco Examiner.

"It's too shocking, too upsetting, too provocative."</P>

<P>Shocking? Outrageous? Andrea Martin hopes so. She underwent mastectomies

in 1989 and 1991 and it's her chest that's on display in the ads --

superimposed on models' bodies. Martin, 53, is director of The Breast

Cancer Fund (<A HREF="http://www.breastcancerfund.org">www.breastcancerfund.org</A>), a San Francisco-based  nonprofit

organization dedicated to putting an end to the breast cancer epidemic

through education and funding for research. The ads are part of the

organization's "Obsessed with Breasts" campaign intended to raise public

awareness about the disease.</P>



<P>The posters (all work on which was done pro bono) were designed to

change the way people think about breast cancer and to challenge

society's obsession with the female breast as an object. But the ads

have met with resistance even within the breast cancer community. The

American Cancer Society (<A HREF="http://www.cancer.org">www.cancer.org</A>) has come out against them,

according to Martin, citing concern that the images might upset and

frighten women away from getting mammograms or seeing a doctor. However,

while Martin has her own reservations about what she calls "one size

fits all" prescriptions for mammograms, the screening exam was not the

focus of the campaign.</P>

<P>"We need to think about exposure to toxins, exercise and diet and the

things we know can help prevent the disease while we're waiting for

scientific answers," Martin says. "There are so many things women need

to do to educate themselves about this disease besides mammograms and

self exams." Martin does note that until there are other adequate

screening methods women should use those currently available after

taking into account their personal and family medical histories.</P>

<P>Educating people about the disease and getting them involved with

raising funds for research into environmental causes of the disease are

two of the main goals of the campaign. The Breast Cancer Fund's site

offers a call to action for people to get involved. Their new book,

"Pathways to Prevention: Eight Practical Steps -- From the Personal to

the Political -- Toward Reducing the Risk of Breast Cancer" offers more

ways to get engaged.</P>

<P>Regardless of the fact that their ads were pulled, the posters have

succeeded in bringing attention to the subject. Since they were

introduced in late January, traffic on the Fund's Web site has

increased. During the first week of February they had 8,000 pageviews,

far exceeding normal numbers (and more people visited the Obsessed with

Breasts pages than the homepage). They've heard from men and women

around the world. Media calls have poured in from across the globe, from

the BBC to Elle magazine.</P>

<P>"I think freedom of expression has been abridged," says Martin of the

censorship the ads received. "The people making the decisions are

substituting personal sensibilities for the entire community. The

community has every right to see the ads."</P>

<P>Community response to the campaign has been overwhelmingly supportive

and Martin is optimistic that the positive public opinion will help turn

the campaign around.</P>

<P>"Our sincere hope is that the bus shelter organizations will reconsider

their decision based on the obvious strength of public opinion in favor

of the campaign. In addition, we hope that the increased awareness about

the campaign will bring forward other possible sponsors for the ad in

places that include women's magazines and other consumer publications."</P>

<P>And it seems that new life may be breathed into the campaign. According

to a February 8 article in the San Francisco Examiner, another billboard

company, Eller Media, announced it will display the ads free of charge

on a number of billboards in the city. However, all their boards are

currently rented through September, so when that may happen remains

unclear.</P>

<P>Outdoor Systems' Lillian says he will not bow to pressure just because

another company plans to display the ads. He says that since the space

to display the posters was donated he feels no need to do so. But he may

have no choice. The Breast Cancer Fund has been in discussion with the

American Civil Liberties Union to determine if in fact First Amendment

rights have been violated.</P>

<P>In a letter to San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, Alan Schlosser,

managing attorney for the local office of the ACLU, wrote: "If the City

is going to allow bus shelters to be opened up to speech activity, it

cannot allow the spaces to become an arena for censorship." It remains

to be seen whether or not legal action will be taken.</P>

<P>On February 7, Supervisor Mark Leno introduced a resolution commending

Martin and The Breast Cancer Fund for their work. While it does not

condemn Outdoor Systems, if the resolution is passed it will put the

city on record supporting the Obsessed with Breasts campaign.</P>

<P>So there's new hope that more people will see the photos and hopefully

learn more about the disease, protecting themselves and what needs to be

done to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of women in the future.</P>

<P>"These ads have got the power of truth," Martin says. "They may cause

you to look away or be stopped in your tracks, but when you start

thinking about them you have to admit to the truth of this. What is

wrong with a society that can objectify women and their bodies and not

look at the truth of breast cancer?"</P>
