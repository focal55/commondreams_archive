<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Clinton is considering Sen. Russ Feingold's request for a

moratorium on federal executions, the White House said.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The request is being reviewed by White House counsel, spokesman Joe Lockhart

said. But he said that does not guarantee that Clinton would act on the matter

soon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A spokesman said Clinton is "certainly concerned'' about Illinois' decision

to halt executions and evaluate how that state handles the death penalty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The president was certainly concerned by the issues raised by the governor

of Illinois,'' Lockhart said. "If there are legitimate concerns that are brought

to us, we will look at the concerns. But I can't predict anything beyond that

until we've had a chance to study the issue.''</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feingold, D-Wisconsin, a longtime opponent of the death penalty, wrote

letters to Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno dated Wednesday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feingold wrote the letters after Illinois Gov. George Ryan halted executions

earlier this week. Ryan cited the high number of death-row inmates later found

innocent in his decision to stop executions pending a review of whether the

death penalty is being administered fairly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We'll see how far we get,'' Feingold said in an interview Friday. "It makes

me ill to think we have had innocent people on death row in this country. I

think it's a great opportunity for us to not make a horrible mistake at the

federal level.''</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last federal execution took place in 1963, but 21 inmates sit on federal

death row and another eight are on military death row, Feingold said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the federally condemned is Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another, Juan Raul Garza, has exhausted his appeals and could become the

first federally executed prisoner in more than 35 years. Garza, head of a

marijuana-trafficking ring in Brownsville, Texas, was sentenced to die for the

murders of three men he suspected of being police informants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feingold introduced a bill in November to abolish the federal death penalty

and called on all states that impose the death penalty to cease the practice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All my life I have felt there's something fundamentally wrong with the death

penalty. It's an exciting development that people are starting to question

this,'' Feingold said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his letter, Feingold said the government must determine whether the death

penalty is applied in a fair manner, free of racial bias.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Mr. President, in light of the serious questions raised in Illinois and

elsewhere, I respectfully urge you to suspend federal executions and undertake a

thorough review of the administration of the federal death penalty,'' Feingold

wrote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1976, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 death row inmates have

been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a few cases,

persistent investigation by college journalism students.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according to

the Death Penalty Information Center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feingold said that although Clinton has been a supporter of the death

penalty, he may choose to weigh other factors in considering a moratorium.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The president is, in my view, fair-minded and concerned about the

administration of our system of justice. I think he's also sensitive to issues

of racial bias, which are among the many issues that are involved with the death

penalty,'' Feingold said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local leaders were energized by the development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Mayor Paul Soglin said it was "a courageous act by both Senator

Feingold and the president. I hope the president exercises the moratorium.''</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mayor Sue Bauman said through her spokesman, Ryan Mulcahy: "I oppose the

death penalty and would be happy to see a moratorium on the death penalty.''</font></p>
