<p>OKINAWA, Japan (Reuters) - More than 27,000 people linked

hands under the bright skies of Japan's Okinawa island on

Thursday in a dramatic protest against U.S. forces there.

<p>They formed a human chain stretching 11 miles around the

largest U.S. air base in Asia.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>Singing, laughing, and occasionally beating drums or playing

guitars, they came together from all around Japan in hopes of

showing President Clinton the huge U.S. military presence on the

Japanese island must be reduced.

<p>The protest took place a day before Clinton's arrival to

join other Group of Eight leaders in a summit residents hope can

throw a spotlight on festering local resentment of what they

have long complained is an unfairly heavy burden.

<p>``Bases are places where they practice killing people every

day,'' was written on a handkerchief held by a demonstrator.

<p>The initially festive atmosphere in the human ring -- just

an arm's length from the fence surrounding Kadena Air Force Base

-- turned solemn just minutes after it was announced the chain

had been formed.

<p>``Fifty-five years ago Okinawa was the only place in Japan

to suffer a land battle,'' said organizer Seishu Sakaihara,

referring to the 200,000 killed during the 1945 Battle of

Okinawa, the single most bloody episode of the Pacific War.

<p>``In all of Japan we have the greatest experience of

suffering in this way. So we don't want this tragic history to

repeat,'' he said. ``If we permit the bases to stay we are

allowing war.''

<p>Outside one gate leading to a boom town that developed

catering to U.S. military personnel, banners flew that read

''Bases Out of Okinawa,'' ``Get the bases out of the

prefecture,'' ``American troops go home.''

<p>The demonstration was peaceful, with protesters breaking

their chain to allow passage of the few cars entering or leaving

the base.

<p>Kadena's commander, General James Smith, told a news

conference he welcomed the protest as part of the democratic

process but did not know how the G8 leaders would react.

<p>``I don't know how this will be interpreted,'' he said. ``In

many ways, these people just deserve to be heard.''

<p><font size=+1><b>``Years Of Pain''</b></font>

<p>Anti-U.S. base sentiment in Okinawa has festered for years.

<p>``We are expressing 55 years of pain through this chain,''

an editorial in the local Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper said. ``It is

the only way we can do it.''

<p>Residents have long objected to the fact that while they

have less than one percent of Japan's land, they play host to

about 26,000 of the total 48,000 U.S. military personnel in

Japan -- just over one-quarter of the entire U.S. military force

in Asia.

<p>Urgency was injected into the anti-base campaign recently

after a U.S. marine was arrested for molesting a 14-year-old

girl this month and an airman was nabbed for a hit-and-run

accident, setting off a wave of protests and demonstrations.

<p>Colored balloons and ribbons were tied to the perimeter

fence and a women's group displayed banners made up of hundreds

of handkerchiefs, each with peace messages written in Japanese.

<p>The massive Kadena base has the longest runway in the Asian

region. The base's Web site says it ``contributes significantly

to the island's economy.''

<p>Long-standing resentment of the bases flared after the 1995

rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by three U.S. marines, a bitter

memory revived by this month's arrest of the marine.

<p>The incident prompted the U.S. military to slap a late-night

curfew on its forces in Okinawa until after the summit.

<p>Despite calls for removal of the bases, Washington is

unlikely to do so, arguing that their presence is essential for

security in the Asia-Pacific. But the recent reduction of

tension in the region, especially on the Korean peninsula,

brings the issue into question as never before.

<p>Kadena commander Smith said he felt Kadena would become more

important in the years to come, but added: ``The number of

troops in Japan is the most important question that Japan and

the U.S. face over the next 50 years.

<p>``We'd better get it right.''

<p>The G8 comprises the United States, France, Italy, Germany,

Japan, Britain, Canada and Russia.</p>
