<p>WASHINGTON - Despite seemingly beneficial new

scientific breakthroughs in the development of biologically

engineered seed, resistance to genetically altered crops is

spreading among farmers, investors and the general public.

<P>

   In a politically diverse panel discussion held here Thursday on

genetically modified organisms (GMOs), farmers, public interest

scientists and environmentalists remained seriously sceptical of

the technology. 

<P>

   Other participants, including government officials,

corporations

and larger research institutions, continued to tout the benefits

of the new technology while downplaying the potential

environmental

and health risks. 

<P>

   Brian Halweil, a staff researcher at the Worldwatch Institute

here, portrayed the biotech companies as "an industry in trouble." 

<P>

   "Stock prices for agricultural biotech companies are falling,

exports of transgenic crops are tumbling, and questions are

mounting about the liability for what is turning into a major

debacle for farmers," he said. 

<P>

   Responding to growing public alarm over the technology and

international efforts to regulate trade in GMOs, share prices for

biotech seed companies - which were Wall Street's rising stars

just

a few years ago - are sinking toward all-time lows. 

<P>

   In May, Europe's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, recommended that

investors sell all holdings in companies involved in GMOs. 

<P>

   Investors in Monsanto Company, the industry leader which has

borne the brunt of public criticism, have watched the

corporation's

share price lose nearly one-third of its value in the last year,

falling from a high of 50 dollars in February 1999 to a recent low

of just 35 dollars per share. 

<P>

   Further complicating the financial picture, said Halweil, are

concerns about uninsured liabilities for farmers and agribusiness

companies. 

<P>

   In November, 30 farm groups, including the National Family Farm

Coalition and the American Corn Growers Association (ACGA), warned

US farmers that "inadequate testing of gene-altered seeds could

make farmers vulnerable to 'massive liability' from damage caused

by...the spreading of biologically modified pollens." 

<P>

   US farmers have been caught in the middle of the biotechnology

debate between seed dealers, chemical companies, grain traders,

consumers abroad, and trade policy, said Gary Goldberg, chief

executive officer of the ACGA, which represents about 14,000

farmers. 

<P>

   The ACGA does not oppose genetically-modified crops and many of

its members plant them. 

<P>

   But as large food companies in Europe, Japan, and Mexico reject

GMOs, US farmers are hurting, said Goldberg. 

<P>

  Because of lost export corn sales, he estimates that last year

farmers lost more than 200 million dollars. 

<P>

   In the United States, Gerber baby foods, Frito-Lay, Seagram's,

IAMS pet foods, and others have also made the decision to purchase

only non-GMOs. 

<P>

   "The question is whether a farmer can afford to plant a crop

this coming spring that may not be marketable in the fall," said

Goldberg. 

<P>

   Acknowledging the controversy, Dan Glickman, the US secretary

of agriculture, recently called for studies assessing the long-

term

ecological effects of these crops. 

<P>

   But Halweil criticised this effort for coming too late, when

already about half the acreage for major commodities like

soybeans,

cotton, corn and canola in the United States, Argentina and Canada

are planted with modified seed. 

<P>

   "Widespread commercialisation of these crops has come before -

not after - thorough examination of the associated risks and

benefits," he said. 

<P>

   Margaret Mellon, director of the sustainable agriculture and

biotechnology programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists here

said she could count on one hand the number of studies examining

the technology's potential risks to human health. 

<P>

   "We have a 'don't look, don't find' regulatory policy," said

Mellon. 

<P>

   She described the health risks, including the development of

possible allergies to GMOs. Scientists do not know the impact of

ingesting food or introducing crops into the environment that are

designed to contain toxic substances to ward off pests, said

Mellon. 

<P>

   Miguel Altieri, a professor at the University of California at

Berkeley and an international expert on sustainable agriculture,

described the possible ecological impacts of GMOs. 

<P>

   Massive use of crops altered to contain toxins can dramatically

alter ecological processes and impact non-target organisms,

including beneficial insects and micro-organisms in the soil, he

said. 

<P>

   The transfer of genes through cross-fertilisation could create

super-weeds. And insect pests will quickly develop resistance to

crops modified to contain toxins, since they are constantly

bombarded with the chemical, according to Altieri. 

<P>

   Altered crops on the market are just a continuation of the

"prevailing agricultural model that emphasises chemical-based pest

control" and keep farmers vulnerable to pesticide resistance, he

added. 

<P>

   Concerns over these potential risks recently led countries to

draw up the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety, an international

agreement regulating trade in GMOs. 

<P>

   David Sandalow, US assistant secretary of state for

environmental affairs, said he was pleased with the international

agreement. 

<P>

    While acknowledging the potential risks of GMOs, Sandalow and

a representative for Monsanto discussed the possible ways the

technology could be used as a tool to increase crop yields,

prevent

blights, and even improve nutrition. 

<P>

  For example, last month, researchers at the Institute of Plant

Sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich

announced they had successfully developed a strain of genetically

modified rice capable of eliminating vitamin A deficiency. 

<P>

   This nutritional problem kills up to two million children a

year

and is the world's leading cause of blindness. 

<P>

   "Biotechnology is not going to feed the world," said Robert

Horsch, co-president of Monsanto's sustainable development

programme, contradicting previous advertising slogans of the

company. 

<P>

   "But it is going to be an essential piece of the total

solution," he said. 

<P>

   But despite industry claims, biotech companies have channeled

most of their research to a limited range of products designed for

the capital-intensive farmers of industrialised nations, argued

Halweil of Worldwatch. 

<P>

   Altered seed products, such as Bt corn and Round-up Ready

soybeans, have little relevance to poor, subsistence farmers, who

grow different crops facing other problems, like drought, he said. 

<P>

   "Beyond this obvious disconnect between advertised objectives

and where the money is really going, the search for a biotech fix

for hunger clearly distracts attention from hunger's underlying

causes and other alternative interventions that may prove more

appropriate," said Halweil.
