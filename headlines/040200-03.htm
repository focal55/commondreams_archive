FLORHAM PARK, N.J., April 1 -- The police brought out 

mounted patrols,  dogs and metal 

barricades  today to  prepare for a 

protest against the World Bank and 

International Monetary Fund  by 

many of the same people who led 

destructive demonstrations last year 

at the World Trade Organization 

meetings in Seattle.



<p>  Billed in a news release as  "picking up where Seattle left off," the 

rally outside a World Bank and 

I.M.F. conference here was expected 

to draw several hundred protesters, 

said organizers of the New Jersey/New York Mobilization for Global Justice.



<p>  They said the rally was  a tuneup 

for a  demonstration  at meetings of 

the two economic groups on April 16 

and 17  in Washington, D.C.



<p>  Organizers said they did not plan 

to disrupt the weekend meetings 

sponsored by the two groups and the 

Brookings Institution.



<p>  The protesters planned to rally at 

a barricaded parking lot next to the 

Hamilton Park Conference Center.



<p>  But two women who were part of 

the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in December were 

arrested on Thursday after they  unfurled a 40-foot banner from the top 

of the  center, the police said.



<p>  The women, Lisa Kuhn, 19, of Salt 

Lake City and Judith Karpova, 54, of 

Hoboken, were charged with criminal trespassing, criminal mischief 

and possession of burglary tools, the 

authorities said. The two used bolt 

cutters to cut the chain on a trap door 

to the roof of the hotel before unfurling the banner,  which read "World 

Bank and IMF = Corporate Colonialism," the authorities said.



<p>  A rally organizer, Ted Glick, said 

the coalition did not advocate violence or civil disobedience, but "a 

number of us thought that was a nice 

action."



<p>  "Ultimately, we can't stop them," 

he said of groups who may decide to 

protest more forcefully.



<p>  The coalition blames the W.T.O., 

the World Bank and the I.M.F. for 

globalization of the world economy. 

The protesters  believe that the World 

Bank and the I.M.F., charged with 

using international corporations to 

improve life in developing countries, 

instead throw the countries into debt 

while enriching corporations and degrading the environment.



<p>  About 100 people attending the 

conference are meeting to discuss 

the collapse of economies in Asia and 

its effect on developing countries. A 

World Bank spokesman, Andrew 

Kircher, said the bank had noticed a 

rising level of awareness of the meetings in the United States, especially 

since the Seattle protests.



<p>  More than 100 officers, some with 

horses and dogs, have been patrolling the conference center here since 

the conference began on Thursday, 

said Steven Foley, a spokesman for 

the Morris County prosecutor's office. The police put up barricades 

and first aid tents and videotaped 

protesters from a hotel window.



<p>  Mr. Foley described the police 

presence as precautionary, a reaction to the violence and destruction 

that paralyzed the Seattle sessions of 

the World Trade Organization. Those 

protests led to $2.5 million in damage, a state of emergency in the city 

and the arrests of 500 protesters.



<p>  Four protesters slept by the side of 

the road here on Thursday night, 

surrounded by signs with messages 

like "Break the Boomerang of 

Debt," and "Honk for Global Justice."



<p>  On Friday, mounted police officers 

and officials standing on the hotel 

roof with binoculars outnumbered 

the 20 or so protesters who marched 

from a teach-in on Drew University's 

campus about a mile away.
