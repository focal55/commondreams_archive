NEW YORK   - The United Nations must tread carefully

in its partnership with the private sector, setting up monitoring

mechanisms to ensure that it does not lose sight of the values

enshrined in its Charter, non governmental organisations (NGOs)

meeting here this week said Thursday.

<P>

At the Davos Forum in January 1999,  where governments and

business leaders met to discuss the world economy, UN Secretary-

General Kofi Annan called for a "Global Compact" between the

United Nations and the business community.  

<P>

He challenged business leaders to embrace and enact nine core

principles derived from international agreements on labour

standards, human rights and environmental practices. In exchange,

he promised the United Nations will support free trade and open

markets.  

<P>

Since then, the United Nations has been talking with the private

sector exchanging views and promoting partnership-based approaches

to achieve the aims of this Compact. 

<P>

It also has a website on global corporate citizenship which

"brings together activities, issues and information related to the

Compact's three areas," said Denize O'Brien, Information Officer

at the UN Department of Public Information.

<P>

Addressing the Millennium Forum on May 22, Annan spoke of the need

for new norms of international behaviour, stressing that non

governmental organisations (NGOs) could help individuals

participate in the global economy and make sure that policy

choices had an impact on daily lives. 

<P>

But although citizens' organisations recognise that the private

sector has "an enormous influence" on human development and

rights, they are not so enthusiastic about this partnership and

fear that due to the financial pressure it faces, the United

Nations will "sell its soul to the devil." 

<P>

"It's dangerous to assume that the goals of the private sector are

somehow synonymous with those of the United Nations because they

most emphatically are not," Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of

UNICEF once said.   

<P>

"As an educator, I use to say to my children that the UN is good

and that big corporations are not so good," stated Kenny Bruno. 

<P>

Bruno is part of a global movement "Citizens Compact On the United

Nations and Corporations" through which more than 40 organisations

from all over the globe pledge their active support for a

"strengthening of the United Nations, financially and

politically."  

<P>

They also adhere to nine principles to safeguard the "image,

mission and credibility" of the United Nations as it deals with

the private sector.  

<P>

"Multinational corporations are too important for their conduct to

be left to voluntary and self generated standards," says James A.

Paul, Executive Director of the Global Policy Forum. A legal

framework, including monitoring, must be developed to govern their

behaviour, he argued. 

<P>

Paul found it disturbing that private companies had been "pouring

millions of dollars into US right wing organisations such as the

Heritage Foundation that had been attacking the UN, while there

are attempts to restrict NGOs access to the UN." 

<P>

Moreover, say several representatives of NGOs, the United Nations

must ensure that the Bretton Woods institutions - the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank - and the

World Trade Organisation (WTO) respect the principles and goals of

the United Nations Charter which is centred on humanitarianism.  

<P>

Above all, the United Nations should not endorse or promote

products or brand names of any private corporation.  

<P>

The idea that representatives of international corporations enjoy

a special status in the United Nations was dismissed by Bill

Stirberly of the International Chamber of Commerce, one of the

private institutions currently discussing with the UN Secretary

General the framework of the Global Compact. He also denied NGO

criticism that through this partnership, the world body was

bringing the private sector directly into its decision making

process. 

<P>

Several humanitarian organisations, including Handicap

International, Action Against Hunger and Doctors Without Borders

meanwhile have called on civil society to protect the humanitarian

principles which are linked with human rights and to reject "all

attempts to transform the field of humanitarian assistance into a

new market open to private companies." 

<P>

Jean Francois Vidal, of Action Against Hunger, says that several

international companies have begun competing with humanitarian

NGOs in the field, "making our work even more difficult." Vidal

expressed strong doubts that private companies can protect

civilians, especially in conflict situations.  

<P>

NGOs have advised the United Nations to ensure that private

donations to the world body go to programmes which have no link to

the donor's commercial activities. 

<P>

Furthermore, in its partnership with the private sector, the

United Nations should act with "full transparency at the

conceptual, planning and implementation stages", and NGOs should

have access to the information.
