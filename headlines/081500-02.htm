LOS ANGELES - At 

Democratic conventions past, the 

Rev. Jesse Jackson wrote  a compelling piece of the story line. The 1988 

convention in Atlanta, for instance, 

was consumed with the question of 

how warmly Mr. Jackson would embrace Michael S. Dukakis, who had 

defeated him in the primaries.



<p>    At this year's convention, however, Mr. Jackson's son Representative 

Jesse L. Jackson Jr. is the one making waves by giving voice to the 

concerns within the party's left wing 

about its centrist ticket.

</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>It began on Saturday, at a forum at 

the University of Southern California, when Mr. Jackson, a third-term 

Democrat from Chicago, was asked 

whether people should vote for Vice 

President Al Gore and his running 

mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman.



<p>  "The only option is Al Gore," he 

responded. "But if there was another 

campaign that was speaking to our 

issues that had the possibility and 

plausibility of winning, we should 

support that campaign."



<p>  Today, at another forum, this one 

part of a shadow convention organized by a coalition of left-leaning 

groups, Mr. Jackson made it clear 

that he would aggressively campaign for the Gore-Lieberman ticket. 

But he continued to cast his decision 

as one driven more by his fear of the 

alternative: electing George W. Bush 

and Dick Cheney.



<p> At a news conference after the 

speech, Mr. Jackson said: "I am 

supporting Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman, and I'm doing it as enthusiastically as I can. But Jackie Wilson is 

not on the ticket, and Elvis Presley is 

not on the ticket, so Mr. Excitement 

is not running for president. This is 

about pragmatism."



<p>    Indeed, there has been low-level 

tension among Democrats, tension 

that has surfaced anew since Mr. 

Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. 

Lieberman as his running mate -- 

that pits centrists against  Democratic liberals. While a moderate message is seen as necessary to win 

undecided independent voters, the 

party's left wing argues that a more 

traditional agenda is needed to excite minorities and other voters from 

the Demcrats' base.   

<p>Some liberals 

have complained about Mr. Lieberman's support for federal vouchers 

to pay for private school tuition and 

about his statements in opposition to 

affirmative action.



<p>  On Tuesday, Mr. Lieberman is expected to address some of those concerns at a meeting of black delegates 

here, and several Gore campaign 

officials have been acting as ambassadors to concerned black Democrats, assuring them that Mr. Lieberman's record is acceptable.



<p>Such concerns are something the 

Gore campaign could do without as it 

tries to generate enthusiasm for its 

candidate, and seeks to motivate a 

traditional base that include minorities, women and union members.



<p>     Mr. Jackson said he would try to 

persuade disillusioned liberal Democrats against defecting to  Ralph Nader and the Green Party. And he 

criticized the Gore campaign's recent emphasis on restoring the country's sense of morality, something 

Mr. Lieberman has emphasized 

throughout his career.   

<p>"When we 

start getting into this personal-life 

litmus test we are deep in Jerry 

Falwell and Pat Robertson territory," the younger Mr. Jackson said, 

"and that is unfamiliar Democratic 

real estate."



<p>  Mr. Jackson's father has not 

stayed silent, and today made essentially the same point.   

<p>"If it means we 

have to hold our noses and take castor oil, do it," the elder Mr. Jackson 

urged a group of voters today. 



<p>The elder Mr. Jackson is scheduled to speak at the convention on 

Tuesday night. Though he has had 

starring roles at past conventions, he 

said he was not bothered by the fact 

that he was slated to appear this 

year before network television coverage begins. 



<p>  "Whenever I speak," he said, "it's 

prime time."
