<p>A San Francisco group's protest against radio talk-show 

host Laura Schlessinger for her view of homosexuality as deviant has 

picked up national steam.	 

</P>

<P>Within two days of its inception on Wednesday, a Web site called 

<a href="http://www.stopdrlaura.com">Stop Dr. Laura</a> had surpassed 1 million visits. The site encourages 

people to flood Paramount, producers of Schlessinger's planned 

television talk show, with complaints about giving her a wider forum.	 

</P>

<P>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors will jump into the fray on 

Monday, with the entire 11-member board co-sponsoring a resolution 

demanding that Schlessinger tone down statements about lesbians and 

gays. And Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley said in a 

recent radio interview that her views ``make me sick to my stomach.''	 

</P>

<P>John Aravosis, an Internet consultant who is part of an ad hoc group 

of gay activists who put up the <a href="http://www.stopdrlaura.com">Web site</a>, said, ``She tapped into a 

core issue that really hurts gay people deep down inside; people read 

her quotes and flip out.''	 

</P>

<P>Schlessinger, whose show has surpassed Rush Limbaugh's in the 

ratings, has been under fire for describing homosexuality as deviant 

and a ``biological error.'' Schlessinger, who spends three hours on-

air each weekday helping listeners with their moral quandaries, 

preaches that sexual orientation can be changed.	 

</P>

<P>Schlessinger was not available for comment, and a spokeswoman from 

Paramount would not say how many telephone calls or faxes the company 

received after the Web site's detailed directions on how to lodge 

complaints.	 

</P>

<P>But Paramount's prepared statement said: ``We respect and believe in 

Dr. Laura's right to have and express her own point of view, just as 

we respect the individual opinions of all our talent, employees and 

producers.''	 

</P>

<P>Last week, the Horizons Foundation, based in San Francisco and the 

nation's first lesbian and gay community foundation, complained that 

Schlessinger's harsh words are dangerous to gay teenagers.	 

</P>

<P>The foundation submitted a letter to the three California stations 

that carry her show, including KGO-

AM in San Francisco, signed by the Child Welfare League, the National 

Mental Health Association and Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of 

Harvard University's African American studies department, as well as 

by more than 175 individuals and organizations.	 

</P>

<P>The signers asked Schlessinger to stop calling gays deviant and to 

stop supporting the notion that therapy can reverse homosexuality, an 

assertion that has been contradicted by the American Psychological 

Association and the American Medical Association.	 

</P>

<P>Schlessinger is not a licensed psychiatrist. She has a doctorate in 

physiology and a postdoctoral certification in marriage, family and 

child counseling. Her show reportedly has 20 million listeners and is 

broadcast in nearly 500 stations in the United States and Canada.
