<p>PHILADELPHIA -  Republican officials insist that their financial base is primarily small donors, but the party has received 

more than $90 million from a relatively small pool of wealthy individuals and corporations, some of whom 

have shielded their generosity from 

public view.



<p> An elite cadre of 739 contributors, 

writing larger checks than in the 

past, has provided two-thirds of the 

party's $137 million in so-called soft 

money, the unrestricted party gifts. 

Some donors have been directed by 

party officials to make their gifts in 

ways that disguise their identity and 

the degree of their largess, according to a top Republican fund-raiser.



<p> The party's platinum-level sponsors are the Republican Regents, a 

group of 139 people and corporations 

that party officials say have each 

given at least $250,000 in soft money 

since January 1999. Two-thirds of the 

Regents are individuals, the rest are 

corporations. According to Federal 

Election Commission records, the select membership includes Lawrence 

Kadish, a New York real estate developer; Kenneth W. Lay, the chairman of Enron Corporation; Jerrold 

Perenchio, the chairman of the Univision television network; and Alex 

Spanos, a developer and investor 

based in Stockton, Calif.



<p> But Federal Election Commission 

records show only 54 corporations 

and individuals as having given the 

large donations to the party because 

some donors have split them into 

smaller checks, at the suggestion of 

party officials. That effectively 

makes the donors' contribution totals harder to trace.



<p> Some donors have also written 

checks to state party committees, 

whose records are not filed with the 

Federal Election Commission and 

are hard to obtain. Several party 

fund-raisers acknowledged that 

some donors have been told by finance officials to make contributions 

in the name of more obscure corporate subsidiaries that cannot always 

be easily linked to individuals.



<p> Bill Pascoe, the Republican Party 

press secretary, said he was not 

aware of a deliberate plan to direct 

large contributors to send checks to 

state party committees as a way of 

disguising the size of their gifts.



<p> But fund-raisers said big-dollar donors were willing to write numerous 

checks to different party committees 

to try to preserve their privacy. 

Some have even asked for suggestions from party officials for ways to 

disguise  their contribution levels.



<p>       "It's broken up," said a longtime 

Republican fund-raiser who declined 

to be named. "A man gives some, a 

spouse gives, an investment company gives, a subsidiary gives. People 

want anonymity. The party doesn't 

care; they're getting their money."



<p> Behind closed doors here this 

week, the Regents are getting suitably royal treatment.



<p> At 4 p.m. on Monday, Tiffany & 

Company closed early so it could 

hold a private reception for 200  Regents and their spouses. They sipped 

soup from mock Faberg&#0233; eggs as a 

string quartet played. Joan Specter, 

the wife of  Senator Arlen Specter of 

Pennsylvania,  designed the table arrangements, which included rare orange Gerber daisies and matching 

roses. Each Regent was given a 

trademark blue Tiffany box containing a crystal bowl, inscribed with 

George W. Bush's signature.



<p> Some Regents played golf this 

morning with Republican elected officials and former cabinet members 

at the White Marsh Valley Country 

Club in Lafayette Hills, Pa.



<p> These events have been strictly off 

limits to reporters, and credentials 

are carefully checked at the door. 

Several Regents asked the Republican National Committee to send extra party workers to guard their 

events from the media. (Party officials refused,  suggesting the club 

hire its own security guards.)



<p>Party officials declined to disclose 

the Regents' membership list or a 

complete convention agenda, but The 

New York Times obtained a carefully guarded list of the Regents' Philadelphia itinerary from a member. On 

the calendar, the events are listed 

"REGENTS ONLY."



<p> In previous years, the donor elite 

was Team 100, a group of $100,000 

contributors that began in 1988 to 

help elect President George Bush. 

The club, now dedicated to the election of his son George W., the governor of Texas, has grown to 600 members and accounts for more than $60 

million of the party's $137 million  in 

soft money. In Philadelphia, some 

Team 100 members have complained that their events are too 

crowded. One Regent crowed that 

Team 100 members were packed like 

sardines in their party suite, while 

the $250,000 club members had 

"room to stretch our legs."



<p> "You pay a little more, you get a 

little more," Mel Sembler,  finance 

chairman of the Republican National 

Committee, said the other day.



<p> Party officials said that while they 

were grateful for the support of big 

donors, the core of the party was its 

600,000 small contributors, whose  average donation  is $99.63, they said.



<p> "We are the party of small donors 

who represent grass-roots America," said Jim Nicholson, the party 

chairman. "We're pleased with the 

outpouring of support we've seen in 

recent weeks, particularly since 

Governor Bush announced his selection of Dick Cheney."



<p> Some of the party's biggest donors 

have also written large checks to 

state Republican Party chapters. 

For example, 17 top donors to the 

national party also appear as donors 

to the Indiana party, according to the 

National Institute on Money in State 

Politics. Sam Fox, the chairman of 

the Harbour Group, a Missouri manufacturing company, and the party's 

largest individual donor, is credited 

in state records  with having given 

the Indiana party $275,000. But Mr. 

Fox said in an interview today that 

he had not written a check to the 

state party. A Republican National 

Committee official said he could not 

explain the discrepancy.



<p> The institute  found that 10 top national party contributors also gave a 

total of $367,000 to the New York 

party. A  fund-raiser said that contributors were given credit for contributions to state parties when determining their qualifications for the 

Regents and Team 100 clubs.



<p> Campaign finance experts  criticized the Republican Party today for 

what they said appeared to be efforts 

 to hide large contributions.



<p>  "This is an extraordinary development," said Fred Wertheimer, an 

advocate of revisions in federal campaign finance law  and the president 

of Democracy 21, a group that works 

toward that end. "These efforts to 

raise soft money secretly are an outrageous evasion of disclosure laws. 

Large soft-money contributions are 

disappearing underground."



<p>  Since March 1999, Governor Bush 

has raised $93.2 million in checks of 

$1,000 or less, much of it raised by a 

network of fund-raisers called the 

Pioneers. He has promptly listed his 

donors and the amounts they have 

contributed on his  Web  site.



<p>  "I have always supported rapid 

public disclosure of campaign contributions as a healthy campaign finance reform," Mr. Bush said in 

September.



<p> Mr. Sembler, a Florida shopping 

center magnate  and former ambassador to Australia, created the Regents last year,  coining the name. 



<p> "I thought it had a lofty sound to 

it," Mr. Sembler said in an interview 

earlier this year. But some Republicans do not like the name, saying it 

hardly hides the fact that a small 

donor group gets royal treatment 

from the party.

 This week's highlight event is a 

"Regents only" reception that precedes Wednesday's Republican gala 

lunch to be held at the Philadelphia 

Marriott. The Regents will get  to 

meet privately with Governor  Bush 

and his wife, Laura; Mr. Cheney; 

and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.



<p> When asked if he would allow a 

reporter to attend a Regents event, 

Mr. Sembler laughed. "Write me a 

$250,000 check," he said, "and I'll 

open the door for you."
