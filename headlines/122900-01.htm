WASHINGTON  - With only three days left before the

deadline for

heads of state to sign the 1998 Rome Treaty for the International

Criminal

Court (ICC), human rights groups are hoping that outgoing

President Bill

Clinton will stand up to Pentagon pressure and finally put his pen

to paper.

<P>

The lobbying at the White House reportedly is fast and furious, as

the State

Department, which has always supported joining the treaty in

internal

administration councils, is going head to head with the military

brass who

have

insisted that the treaty permanently exempt US troops from the

ICC's

jurisdiction as the price for Washington's signature. 

<P>

''It's definitely in play,'' said Richard Dicker, pointman on the

treaty for

New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW). ''They are clearly taking

a close and

careful look at this.'' 

<P>

The principal focus of the debate is Clinton's national security

adviser,

Sandy

Berger, who, while said to be personally sympathetic to the ICC

supporters,

has

carefully guarded the president's flanks from right-wing and

military attack. 

<P>

Political considerations weigh heavily. Clinton has always had a

troubled

relationship with the armed forces. Embarrassed by charges that he

evaded the

draft during the Vietnam War, he has consistently backed down in

the face of

their demands, such as Washington's boycott of the treaty on

banning

anti-personnel mines and, most recently, its refusal to apologise

for a

massacre of civilian refugees in South Korea 50 years ago. 

<P>

More recently, Democrats have been smarting from attacks by

Republicans over

alleged efforts by Vice President Al Gore's campaign to challenge

absentee

ballots cast by soldiers and sailors overseas that did not satisfy

technical

requirements of Florida law. 

<P>

So intense was the criticism, that the Army and Air Force military

commands

published warnings that it is a crime for active-duty personnel to

express

contempt for the nation's political leaders. 

<P>

Some officials worry that the perceived gap between Democrats and

the military

leadership could widen further if Clinton defies the Pentagon and

signs the

treaty. 

<P>

On the other hand, public support for the ICC appears to have

grown

steadily in

the waning days of Clinton's presidency, if judged by the number

and

geographical spread of newspapers which have come out in its

favour. 

<P>

Those include not only the New York Times, which has long

supported the ICC,

but some major regional newspapers as well, including, most

recently the St.

Louis Post-Dispatch, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and the San

Francisco

Chronicle. 

<P>

In addition, a last-minute rush to sign the treaty by other

countries -

including some which opposed or abstained on the adoption of the

treaty -

could

increase pressure on Clinton to take the leap. By the end of the

weekend,

Dicker believes the total number of signatories could rise from

123 as of

Wednesday to as many as 135, 15 more than those which voted for it

in July

1999. 

<P>

Unconfirmed reports that both Iran and Israel have signalled their

intention to

sign this weekend could also be crucial, as right-wing opposition

to the

treaty

in the Senate, centred on Foreign Relations Committee Chairman

Jesse Helms,

has

long cited Israel's opposition to the treaty as a major reason why

Washington

should oppose it, too. 

<P>

''If Israel signs, it leaves the United States even more

exposed,'' said

Dicker, adding that the Israeli army is repeatedly subject to

charges of war

crimes committed by its troops. 

<P>

The treaty authorises the creation of a permanent independent

judicial body to

investigate and prosecute individuals alleged to have committed

serious crimes

under international law, including genocide, crimes against

humanity, and war

crimes. 

<P>

The ICC, however, will be authorised to take up such cases only

when the

defendants' national courts are shown to have been either

unwilling or unable

to meet their obligations to prosecute such cases themselves. 

<P>

The United States helped create the most important international

tribunal of

this kind after World War II, when Nazi leaders were tried at

Nuremberg. More

recently, the Clinton administration has supported other limited

international

criminal tribunals for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Iraq. 

<P>

But, under Pentagon pressure, Clinton has not supported a

permanent ICC. The

price of US backing, according to senior administration officials,

is a formal

guarantee that US military officials or civilians abroad will not

be

subject to

the Court's jurisdiction. 

<P>

The Pentagon is concerned that, given the global reach of US

military power,

other countries may be tempted to make politically motivated

charges

against US

soldiers. It has been backed by right-wing lawmakers like Helms

who say that

the ICC's mere creation and assertion of universal jurisdiction

violate US

sovereignty. 

<P>

He and the Republican leadership have gone so far as to draft

legislation that

would cut off aid and impose other sanctions against countries

which ratify

the

treaty. 

<P>

Undeterred, 25 countries, including staunch US ally Germany, have

ratified the

treaty which will take effect once 60 countries ratify it - a goal

which is

likely to be achieved by the end of 2002, according to its

supporters. 

<P>

Other treaty supporters - including Washington's NATO allies -

have tried to

accommodate US concerns by adding provisions to reduce the

possibility of

''runaway prosecutors'' filing and investigating politically

motivated claims

against US or other forces. But these efforts were rejected at the

last

negotiating session at the UN headquarters in New York earlier

this month. 

<P>

By signing the treaty before the Dec. 31 deadline, Clinton would

not commit

the United States to ratify it, which can only be done by a

majority of the

Senate. 

<P>

In fact, given the strong opposition to the treaty on the part of

Helms and

the

Republican leadership - as well as President-elect George W.

Bush's own

statements against it during the election campaign - chances of

Senate

ratification are considered nil over the next four years. 

<P>

But, by signing the treaty, Clinton would ensure that Washington

could still

take part in negotiations over its implementation. 

<P>

Treaty supporters also argue that Clinton's signature would be an

important

symbolic gesture that, in the words of the New York Times, would

''encourage

eventual ratification and maintain Washington's global leadership

in human

rights and efforts to bring international criminals to justice''. 

<P>

''If President Clinton fails to sign the treaty, he will weaken

our

credibility

and moral standing in the world,'' according to a column by Robert

S.

McNamara,

Pentagon chief during the Vietnam War. 

<P>

''We will look like a bully who wants to be above the law,'' wrote

McNamara,

who authored the column with Benjamin Ferencz, a prosecutor at the

Nuremberg

trials after World War Two.
