WASHINGTON -  International arms sales surged last 

year to nearly $30.3 billion, the 

highest level since 1996, and the 

United States solidified its position 

as the world's biggest arms dealer, 

according to an authoritative government report.



<p> The report by Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, showed that 

 American contractors sold nearly 

$11.8 billion in weapons in 1999 -- 

more than a third of the world's 

total and more than all European 

countries combined.



<p> American arms sales, like those 

worldwide, were still far below the 

peaks reached in the aftermath of 

the Persian Gulf war in 1991, but 

the United States has steadily increased its sales in the last few 

years, from $7.7 billion in 1997 and 

$10.3 billion in 1998, the report 

found.



<p> "Obviously the United States' 

position has been consolidated as 

the leading weapons supplier -- 

both for the world as a whole and 

for the developing countries," said 

Richard F. Grimmett, an analyst 

who wrote the report, which is 

delivered every year   to Congress.



<p> While the United States remained the largest supplier, Russia vastly expanded its weapons 

sales in 1999 -- to $4.8 billion, nearly double the $2.6 billion in deals it 

made the year before. With the 

impoverished Russian military 

proving a meager customer, Russia's military-industrial complex 

has begun a major effort to market its wares to Asia, the Middle 

East and Africa.



<p> Nearly half of Russian sales last 

year came from an agreement to 

sell China 40 to 60 Su-30 fighter 

jets, while Russia also provided a 

number of advanced weapons to 

India. With many Western nations 

more willing to buy weapons from 

the United States or other NATO 

nations, China and India are likely 

to remain Russia's most lucrative 

customers in the years to come, 

Dr. Grimmett said.



<p> "The Indians are building up 

their military and the Chinese are 

trying to modernize their force 

structure," he said. "And the Russians are their major supplier. As 

long as those two countries continue to build up, the Russians are 

likely to increase their sales in the 

future."



<p> China also emerged in 1999 as a 

major weapons supplier, reaching 

agreements to sell $1.9 billion 

worth of weapons. That was more 

than double the $925 million it sold 

the year before and the most since 

the Congressional Research Service began compiling its report in 

1992. 



<p> The report attributed most of 

China's increase to relatively 

small weapons deals in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, with 

Pakistan "a key Chinese client." 



<p> The report did not give details of 

China's sales to Pakistan, but a 

separate report sent to Congress 

by the Central Intelligence Agency 

earlier this month said that China 

had increased its efforts to provide 

Pakistan with "missile-related 

technical assistance" last year. It 

also said China had provided similar assistance to Iran, North Korea 

and Libya.



<p> As in the past, roughly two-thirds of all arms were sold to 

developing nations -- and again 

the United States, with $8.1 billion 

in sales, led the way, followed by 

Russia, with $4.1 billion. 



<p> In recent years, the hungriest 

buyers have been countries in the 

Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, 

the United Arab Emirates, Egypt 

and Israel.



<p> In 1999, however, South Africa 

emerged as the leading buyer in 

the developing world, reaching 

agreement for $3.3 billion in weapons purchases, according to the 

report. Much of that was driven by 

the government's  agreement with 

Germany to buy four patrol corvettes and three diesel-electric 

submarines, the report said, a purchase that was criticized by some 

South Africans as too costly.



<p> The report predicted intensifying competition among arms supplies in the years ahead. Many 

countries, eager to protect their 

own defense industries, are less 

likely to turn to the international 

market, while the lingering impacts of the Asia financial crisis of 

1997 could mean still fewer buyers.



<p> The report said, however, that 

those trends enhanced the United 

States' advantage over other international sellers, since previous 

American sales resulted in new 

ones.



<p> "There are very few big sales 

out there," Dr. Grimmett said, 

"but for the last 25 years, we've 

developed relationships with so 

many countries that now, even 

though it's a very difficult market, 

we have a competitive advantage 

in selling spare parts and support 

services."
