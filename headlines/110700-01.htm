BOGOTA, Nov 6   - The candidate who wins the United States

presidential elections Tuesday will maintain that country's

support for 'Plan Colombia' in the US war on the drug trade, which

is based on repression in drug-producing nations, agree Colombian

politicians and experts. 

<P>

   The similar stances held by Republican George W. Bush and

Democrat Al Gore regarding Plan Colombia, President Andrés

Pastrana's anti-drug and pro-development initiative, indicate that

the US drug-fighting policy will continue its course. 

<P>

   Aid totalling 1.3 billion dollars, approved by the US Congress

with bipartisan support, was finalised in August during President

Bill Clinton's visit to Cartagena, on Colombia's northern coast. 

<P>

   The two presidential candidates, with slight differences, back

the drug policy line the United States has been following for more

than a decade - based on fighting drug trafficking at the source,

in the producing countries, said Luis Valencia, a National

University expert in international relations. 

<P>

   As a result, ''relations with Colombia will continue to be

'drug-based' as long as we remain the leading provider of

narcotics for the US market,'' even though under the Pastrana

administration ''we went from being a pariah country to an ally in

the fight against the drug trade,'' he told IPS. 

<P>

   Valencia believes Gore would continue with the hemispheric

priorities set by Clinton, who considers drug trafficking and

circumstances in Colombian to be a matter of US national security. 

<P>

   Vicente Torrijos, former director of the governmental School

for Advanced Studies, says continued US support for Plan Colombia

is a sure thing, at least for the next two years, but agreed with

Valencia that the bilateral relations ''will continue to be based

on drugs as long as it continues to be the Colombian reality.'' 

<P>

   But the expert forecast sharp differences between the two

candidates as far as their potential reaction to the United

States' first assessment of Plan Colombia, to take place in two

years. 

<P>

   For Gore, the human rights question would weigh upon the

evaluation, while for Bush the essential component would be the

concrete results of the anti-drug programmes, said Torrijos. 

<P>

   The most likely scenario in two years, according to Torrijos,

is that illicit crops, which today cover 120,000 hectares, will

not have diminished despite Plan Colombia, and the peace processes

underway between the government and guerrilla groups will not

achieve major advances. 

<P>

   In assessing such a situation, Gore ''would tend to maintain

the line initiated by Clinton for co-operation,'' while Bush, ''if

the results are unsatisfactory, could turn to a more heavy-handed

approach.'' 

<P>

   During the electoral campaign, Gore has claimed as his own

achievement that under the Clinton administration the US Congress

has approved the largest anti-drug budget, which grew from 12.2

billion to 18.5 billion dollars, including 1.3 billion for

Colombia. 

<P>

   Bush has indicated that the US aid package, largely earmarked

for military expenditures, is essential for the Colombian

government ''to protect is people, fight drug trafficking'' and

halt the insurgent groups, ''which are financed by drug profits.'' 

<P>

   The US policy of a full-out war on drugs, with its current

focus on producing countries, gathered strength in 1989 under the

Republican administration of George Bush, father of that party's

current presidential candidate. 

<P>

   Following the end of the Cold War, the United States needed a

new enemy to replace communism as the threat to its national

security, and that role went to the drug trade, with the Colombian

cartels at the top of the list, say analysts. 

<P>

   In 1989, then-president Bush established an alliance for an

Andean strategy to combat drug trafficking with the Colombian

president at the time, Virgilio Barco, and other presidents of the

region. 

<P>

   In the eight years of the Clinton government, bilateral

relations continued to be marked by the illegal drug issue and

suffered their worst moment under president Ernesto Samper (1994-

1998), due to allegations that his electoral campaign had been

financed by money coming from the drug cartels. 

<P>

   During that period, Washington gave Colombia a negative

evaluation of its fight against drug production and denied US

visas to Samper and several Colombian lawmakers. 

<P>

   Then, in 1998, ''the relations went from hell to heaven, due to

the fact that the US government considered Pastrana to be the

antithesis of Samper,'' said former foreign minister Rodrigo

Pardo. 

<P>

   Since the beginning of his presidential term, Pastrana has met

with Clinton five times, the latest being in Cartagena. The result

of the new phase of bilateral relations was the finalisation of

Plan Colombia, Pardo pointed out. 

<P>

   The Pastrana and Clinton governments define the Plan as ''an

integral strategy to fight drug trafficking, and for social

development, peace and strengthening the State.''
