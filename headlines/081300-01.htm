COPENHAGEN  - A long lost U.S. nuclear bomb

probably lies on the seabed off Greenland near Thule airbase,

which the United States wants to use for its controversial

anti-missile shield, a Danish newspaper reported on Sunday.

<p>Classified documents obtained by a group of former workers

at Thule, an Arctic air and radar base built by the United

States in 1951-52, suggest that one of four hydrogen bombs on a

B-52 bomber that crashed there in 1968 was never found, the

daily Jyllands-Posten said.

<p>``Detective work by a group of former Thule workers

indicates that an unexploded nuclear bomb probably still lies on

the seabed off Thule,'' the right-leaning mass-circulation daily

said.

<p>The crash on January 21, 1968 led to a crisis in relations

between the United States and NATO ally Denmark, which is

responsible for Greenland's foreign, security and defense policy

and at the time prohibited nuclear weapons on its territory,

including Greenland.

<p>Denmark was never informed about the lost bomb, which has

serial number 78252, the paper said.

<p>Footage filmed at the site by a U.S. submarine searching for

remains of the B-52 wreckage in April 1968 contained images of a

bomb-like object, the Danish Ritzau news agency reported.

<p>A U.S. state department document dated August 31, 1968 said

all weapons onboard the crashed aircraft had been accounted for

but did not spell out whether they had been recovered, Ritzau

said.

<p>The United States assured the Danish government in spring

1968 that clean-up work after the B-52 crash had been completed

and gave up searching for the lost bomb in August that year,

Jyllands-Posten said.

<p>``We are not able to comment at this stage,'' Lawrence

Butler, Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. embassy in

Copenhagen, told Reuters by telephone. Danish government

officials were not immediately available for comment.

<p>Senior State Department officials are scheduled to visit

Greenland on August 21 to 24 for talks with Danish and Greenland

officials on Thule's role in the planned National Missile

Defense (NMD) initiative.

<p>According to Senate testimony by Defense Secretary William

Cohen in July, Washington needs a decision on upgrading the

Thule radar next year if the White House makes the political

go-ahead to deploy NMD by 2005.

<p>Home to a ballistic missile early-warning radar station,

Thule sits at the midpoint of a chain of similar sites between

Alaska and the British Isles -- a line along which the United

States may build a shield against missiles from what it calls

states of concern such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya.

<p>Leading politicians in Greenland, which has enjoyed limited

self-determination under the Danish crown since 1979, do not

want Thule to play any role in the NMD.

<p>Denmark has declined to speak out on the issue apart from

saying that the NMD should not go ahead if it breaches the

strategic missile treaty between the United States and Russia.

Moscow opposes the U.S. missile shield plan, and says it does

breach the treaty.

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Denmark and

other U.S. NATO allies that their participation in the NMD could

upset global strategic stability.
