<p>BANGKOK - More than 300,000 child soldiers are fighting for national and guerrilla armies around the world, a human rights pressure group said on Wednesday.



<p>Rory Mungoven, coordinator of the <a href="http://www.us-childsoldiers.org/">Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers</a> (CSUCS), said child soldiers, combatants under the age of 18, were used in all parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia.



<p>About 120,000 child soldiers were deployed in armies across Africa and a further 75,000 in Asian countries, including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.



<p>Child soldiers had also played a major part in the militias involved in the violence in East Timor, as well as in local conflicts in India, he said.

<p>"Precious little attention is given to this problem of

child soldiers, although it is widespread," Mungoven told

Reuters. "It is a dark and disturbing aspect of many modern

conflicts."<p>CSUCS is organizing a major conference in Kathmandu from May

15-18, sponsored by several human rights groups and the United

Nations Children's Fund.<p>"We hope the conference will add to the movement for a

global ban on children under 18 being used in conflicts...and

put the use of children as weapons of war beyond the pale," he

said.<p>Mungoven said there was a growing movement around the world

to ban child soldiers and classify the forced recruitment of

children as a war crime.<p>Support for a ban was broad in Asia with backing from

Thailand, Sri Lanka and Nepal, but several Western countries

including the United States and Britain opposed it.<p>The British army, for example, recruited soldiers as young

as 15 years old, he said.<p>"Almost all of the states in this region (Asia) recruit

below the age of 18," he said.
