NUEVA LOJA, Ecuador - The military's fumigation of

coca

plantations in Colombia with the herbicide glyphosate, part of the

government's anti-drug trafficking fight, is causing environmental

damage

and health problems in neighbouring Ecuador's border provinces. 

<P>

Residents of General Farfán and Puerto el Carmen, villages in the

Ecuadorian

Amazon province of Sucumbíos, on the banks of the San Miguel

River, told IPS

that in the days after they heard airplanes fumigating in the

nearby

Colombian department of Putumayo, dozens of trees in their towns

began to

die. 

<P>

'The consequences are felt on this side of the border - many

trees dry up

and no one knows why, but it can be explained by the application

of some

herbicides, like those used in the Colombian fumigations,''

commented Tito

Piedra, resident of Puerto el Carmen. 

<P>

Bolívar Botina, mayor of Puerto Guzmán, on the Colombian side,

affirmed

Piedra's information and added that seven people in the area have

died from

intoxication caused by the extensive fumigation over the last four

months. 

<P>

'Last week they stopped fumigating, perhaps because of the

protests by the

people of Putumayo against Plan Colombia,' but we presume they

will be back

soon,'' said Botina. 

<P>

Plan Colombia, which took effect Sep 1, is President Andrés

Pastrana's

seven-billion-dollar initiative to fight drug trafficking and

production.

The United States has already assured 1.3 billion dollars for the

plan û

largely military aid -, Colombia is to provide 4.5 billion, and

Pastrana is

hoping Europe and Asia will put up the rest. 

<P>

But it was the fumigation efforts in an area of the Colombian

department of

Nariño, bordering Ecuador's mountainous province of Carchi, that

caused the

worst impacts on the Ecuadorian population. 

<P>

'Since August the air we breathe hasn't been the same and there

are

neighbours who have had sore eyes and headaches, which isn't

normal,'' said

Juan Cruz, a farmer from Tobar Donoso, a village in Carchi. 

<P>

Arturo Yepez, a doctor from Tulcán, capital of Carchi, said the

zone's

residents come to him with symptoms similar to peasants who have

been '

poisoned from ingesting pesticides.'' 

<P>

Peasant farmers from Tobar Donoso say there have been only low-

level

fumigations in recent weeks, but they fear renewed massive

efforts, like

those in late August intended to destroy 5,000 hectares of coca

fields on

the Colombian side of the border. 

<P>

At that time, Colombian anti-drug forces used three Turbo Thrush

crop-dusting airplanes, guarded by three Black Hawk helicopters

and 200

soldiers, trained and equipped by the United States. 

<P>

The director of the anti-drug police, Gen. Ismael Trujillo, said

that with

the destruction of the coca fields and of the processing

laboratories in

Nariño his force has prevented the production of approximately 29

tonnes of

cocaine destined for the US market. 

<P>

'While planes flew over the plantations, leaving a wake of

glyphosate in

the air, and the helicopters escorted them to prevent guerrilla

attacks, the

soldiers went into the forest to search for peasants who fled,'' a

coca

grower, who requested his name withheld, told IPS. 

<P>

On the Ecuadorian side, farmers reported that approximately six

hours after

the spraying they saw extensive areas of yucca, or manioc, with

burned

leaves. 

<P>

Glyphosate, one of Monsanto's most important chemical herbicides,

was

introduced in Latin America 25 years ago, marketed principally

under the

name Roundup with annual sales of 1.2 billion dollars. 

<P>

It is an herbicide classified as a Category III Toxin, which calls

for

caution in handling because it can cause gastro-intestinal

problems,

vomiting, enlargement of the lungs, pneumonia, mental confusion,

and

destruction of the red corpuscles in mucus membrane tissues. 

<P>

But the Ecuadorians also fear that in the eradication of coca, the

Colombian

military is using the transgenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum.' The

fungus is

an alternative Washington proposed to the Colombian government,

but has been

denounced by scientists and environmentalists around the world

because of

the dangers posed by its release into the environment. 

<P>

Lucía Gallardo, of the Acción Ecológica' organisation, conducted

research

on the potential environmental consequences of Plan Colombia in

Ecuador and

stresses that 'Fusarium oxysporum would threaten the biodiversity

of the

entire Amazon region.'' 

<P>

'It causes damage to various cultivated plants, leading to

different types

of diseases and wilting of the leaves, rotting fruit and even

killing the

plant. It can also cause illness in humans, especially in patients

with

depressed immune systems, with cancer or AIDS,'' she added. 

<P>

Gallardo also says the fungus has the ability to genetically

mutate and

scatter itself, killing other crops - it is an organism that

easily adapts

to its surroundings. 

<P>

'By introducing the fungus into an ecosystem as complex as the

Amazon, it

could attack important crops like manioc, a food on which the

indigenous

peoples of the Amazon basin depend, and it could spread to the

coast,

affecting coffee, citrus, banana and other plantations,'' the

researcher

pointed out. 

<P>

The Amazon could turn into a focal point of contamination, the

effects of

which could last many years as the fungus can live for 20 years

and is

disseminated by air, soil and water. 

<P>

Fusarium oxysporum is categorised in the draft of the Protocol to

the

Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention as 'a biological agent

for war,''

that once released into the environment is impossible to withdraw,

such that

'its effects are unpredictable.'' 

<P>

'The fungus can spread without taking into account political

borders,

attacking other crops and the biodiversity of Ecuador, Brazil,

Peru and

Venezuela,'' argues Gallardo. 

<P>

Ecuador's Minister of Environment, Jorge Rendón, issued a decree

prohibiting

the use of Fusarium oxysporum in the country and denied that any

experiments

had been carried out within national borders. 

<P>

According to the New York Times, the Colombian Minister of

Environment, Juan

Myer, under pressure from the United States, agreed to test the

effectiveness of the herbicidal fungus in that country, but he

later refuted

the reports, saying Colombia would not allow experiments with the

fungus

there. 

<P>

The Ecuadorian population living along the border is also

concerned that

there might be a massive influx of Colombians, displaced by the

fumigations

and by the escalation of armed confrontations between the

guerrillas,

paramilitary groups and government forces. 

<P>

Anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 peasants from Putumayo could be

displaced and

seek refuge in Sucumbíos, according to official estimates. Massive

immigration would collapse the Ecuadorian province's

administrative

capacity. 

<P>

Several human rights organisations have reported that Colombian

right-wing

paramilitary groups are buying up farms in Sucumbíos, feeding

fears that

confrontations with Colombia's leftist guerrillas will further

spill over

into Ecuadorian territory. 

<P>

Experts believe that coca plantations could spring up in Ecuador,

as

occurred in the early 1990s when coca eradication plans in Peru

prompted the

expansion of coca fields in Colombia. 

<P>

'If that occurs, the indigenous peoples and peasants in those

regions could

be displaced, and the biodiversity and different ecosystems

threatened with

extinction,'' stated Gallardo. 

<P>

More than 20 communities and of the indigenous Kishwa peoples,

located along

the border, would be at risk, she said. 

<P>

Border authorities and non-governmental organisations have formed

the Amazon

Defence Front to monitor the consequences of Plan Colombia on the

region's

environment. 

<P>

'We will not allow them to contaminate our ecosystem, because

they have

already caused enough damage with their oil spills,'' said Máximo

Abad,

mayor of Nueva Loja, capital of Sucumbíos.
