WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (IPS) - Toxic pollution that has mysteriously

entered

Canada's pristine Arctic region has now been linked to air

emissions from

specific municipal waste incinerators, cement kilns and industrial

plants in

the United States, Canada and Mexico, according to a new study

released Tuesday. 

<P>

Although there are few pollution sources in Nunavut, the region of

Arctic

Canada studied, it is on the receiving end of toxic pollutants

known  as dioxin

that have been transported over long distances by the prevailing

air  currents,

says the report by the Center for Biology of Natural Systems of

Queens College

in New York. 

<P>

''Decision makers now have the ability to determine where dioxin

is coming

from

and where it is going,'' says Greg Block with the North American

Commission

for

Environmental Co-operation, a Montreal-based inter-governmental

organisation

set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 

<P>

''This will be very helpful in prioritising cost-effective efforts

to  reduce

exposure,'' he says.  

<P>

Block's organisation commissioned the report.  

<P>

Dioxin are one of a dozen types of chemicals known as Persistent

Organic

Pollutants or POPs, which accumulate in the fat of animals.  

<P>

Dioxin, proven to cause cancer, immune deficiency and harmful

reproductive and

developmental effects, are unintentionally produced as by-products

of

incineration and industrial processes. 

<P>

According to scientists, POPs are capable of being transported

long distances

through the environment and end up settling in colder regions

because  of

weather patterns. 

<P>

The study released Tuesday was a response to numerous scientific

reports that

revealed high amounts of dioxin in the food chain in the polar

regions and

blood supply of indigenous people living in the Arctic, known as

the  Inuit. 

<P>

In Nunavut, for example, even thought there are no significant

sources of

dioxin within 500 kilometres, dioxin concentrations in Inuit

mothers  breast

milk are twice the levels observed in southern Quebec. 

<P>

Now for the first time, this study reveals where exactly the

dioxin

originated.

The authors of the study hope this will aid international and

regional efforts

to reduce dioxin at the source so that it never ends up in the

food chain. 

<P>

''The only possible way of dealing with the issue is going to the

source and

preventing or reducing the amount of dioxin that comes out of that

source,''

says Barry Commoner, a scientist at Queens College who headed the

research

study. 

<P>

Using mathematical and meteorological models, the study analyses

1996-1997

data

obtained by Canadian, Mexican and US environmental regulatory

agencies. 

<P>

The model estimated the amount of dioxin emitted by each source in

the three

countries at its geographical location. Using weather and climate

data, the

model then predicted which dioxin would reach various locations in

Nunavut. 

<P>

Overall the greatest contribution, about 70 to 82 percent, of

dioxin  in

Nunavut

is coming from US sources. 

<P>

About two-thirds of the total dioxin emission is caused by

municipal  waste

incinerators, medical waste incinerators, cement kilns burning

hazardous waste

and backyard trash burning. Iron sintering, and copper and

aluminum smelting,

are other major sources of dioxin, according to the report. 

<P>

While the contamination problem can seem overwhelming, the

realistic

possibility of adequately stopping the pollution at specific

sources  is

strengthened by the study's finding that most of the airborne

dioxin deposited

in Nunavut originates from an extremely small number of individual

sources. 

<P>

Six of the total North American sources identified as emitting the

most

dioxin,

for example, are located in the industrialised eastern half of the

United

States. These include three municipal waste incinerators, two iron

sintering

plants and one copper smelter. 

<P>

Canadian sources contribute between 11 and 25 percent of dioxin

reaching

Nunavut, while Mexican sources contribute about five to 11

percent. The

largest

amount of dioxin emitted by a single Canadian source was a

municipal  waste

incinerator in Quebec. 

<P>

No single Mexican source is ranked in the top 35 percent of sites

listed. 

<P>

Since the model used in the study relies on data from 1996 and

1997,  the

current amount of dioxin coming from the reported sources are

likely  to be

much

different because of recent pollution regulations, says Block. 

<P>

''The snapshot could look different today since 1997 air quality

regulations

have come into place,'' he says. 

<P>

Michael McCally, an expert on dioxin who teaches at New York's

Mount Sinai

School of Medicine called the report ''tremendously significant''. 

<P>

''We have known for a long time that native communities living in

the  Arctic

circle thousands of miles from industry had high levels of dioxin

in  their

blood and tissue samples and now we have specified where the

dioxin is

actually

coming from,'' he told IPS in a phone interview. 

<P>

Indigenous leaders are praising the researchers for finally

pinpointing the

exact location of pollution sources that they said have

contaminated  their

communities for decades. 

<P>

''For us, this particular study is very important,'' says Sheila

Watt

Cloutier,

an Inuit leader in Canada. 

<P>

Tens of thousands of Inuit people living in Nunavut territory

depend  on

Caribou 

for food. Past studies have found that Caribou herds in the region  

are 

contaminated by dioxin. 

<P>

''Human exposure to dioxin is almost entirely (98 percent) through  

animal 

foods, especially those that are rich in fat,'' according to the  

report 

released today. 

<P>

In Washington on Tuesday afternoon, indigenous leaders throughout  

North 

America 

held a press conference in front of the US State Department. They  

called for 

lawmakers to take tougher national and international action on  

eliminating 

Persistent Organic Pollutants at the source. 

<P>

''From the Great Lake tribes to the Native villages of Alaska,  

dioxin , DDT, 

PCB 

and other chemicals are in the bodies of our traditional food web -  

from the 

fish we eat - to the bodies of our people,'' says Tom Goldtooth,  

director of 

the Indigenous Environmental Network, an advocacy group based in  

the  state of 

Minnesota. 

<P>

In December in Johannesburg, South Africa, nations will begin the  

fin al 

negotiating session of an international treaty that seeks to  

eliminate POPs. 

Environmentalists and indigenous groups alike have accused the  

United 

States of 

trying to weaken the treaty. 

<P>

Shawn Larson, who works with Alaska Community Action on Toxics, a  

Native 

American advocacy group, says her village is very concerned about  

the  health 

effects - like cancer, diabetes and learning disabilities that she  

says POPs 

are causing. 

<P>

''I have come here on behalf of my people to ask that the United  

States 

government owns up to its responsibility to protect us as a  

people,''  she told 

reporters on Tuesday.
