<p>EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scientists, regulators and consumer

groups will tackle the thorny issue of GM foods at an

international conference starting on Monday.

<p>The three-day event organized by the Organization for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will focus on the

science of genetically modified food, how it is regulated and

whether or not it is safe to eat.

<p>Instead of slanging matches between biotechnology giants and

environmentalists and consumer activists, the OECD hopes the

meeting will provide suggestions for a constructive way forward.

<p>``The philosophy is to try and identify, through having a

diversity of views and an open debate, areas of greater

convergence and areas of lesser convergence,'' said Sir John

Krebs, the conference chairman.

<p>The professor of zoology at Oxford University said 400

delegates from 14 countries would attend the conference.

<p>It is one of a series of meetings organized by the OECD

following a request by the Group of Eight (G8) big powers for

more information on GM food. Krebs will report the findings of

the conference to a G8 meeting in Okinawa in July.

<p>``Potentially the report could have a significant impact on

the thinking of major countries in the world,'' he said.

<p>Professor Arpad Pusztai, whose research sparked an

international row about the safety of GM food, and Gordon

Conway, president of the Rockefeller Foundation who is credited

with convincing biotechnology giant Monsanto Co to stop using

its ``terminator'' gene technology, will attend.

<p>``I have tried to get as many of the people who are

concerned about GM technology into the conference. Nobody can

accuse us of sidelining the worriers,'' said Krebs.

<p>Scientists will discuss the latest trends in crop genetics,

the impact of GM foods on diet and nutrition and the possibility

of using GM foods, such as golden rice which produces extra

vitamin A, to improve human health.

<p>Delegates from the developing world will be able to voice

their concerns at the meeting which will be broadcast live on

the Internet (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/edinburgh">www.oecd.org/edinburgh</a>). Members of the public can

listen to the speakers and submit questions which will be

presented to the delegates.

<p>Krebs does not expect to find a magic solution to the GM

dilemma, but he said one idea that may emerge from the

conference is a global approach to biotechnology.

<p>``What its structure would be one can't tell, but there are

precedents for having an international forum for debating

scientific issues where science interfaces with policy, for

example the intergovernmental panel on climate change,'' he

said. ``It could be a way forward.''
