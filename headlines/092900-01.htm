WASHINGTON - The underground market in small arms is

booming, according to a new book on the global black market in

small weapons.

<P>

''Whether in Africa, Sri Lanka, Columbia or the United States, it

isn't heavy weaponry or high-tech devices that kill the most

people, but cheap, easy to get small arms,'' states 'Running Guns:

the Global Market in Small Arms' in its opening pages. 

<P>

Timed to influence the United Nations's preparatory meetings for

the 2001 Conference on Illicit Arms Transfers, 'Running Guns' is a

collection of essays analysing different aspects of this

international trade. 

<P>

''Running Guns provides a template of policy measures that

concerned states need to take to thwart this all too easy trade,''

asserts editor Lora Lumpe. 

<P>

Divided into four comprehensive sections, the book's opening

chapter frames the issue with a first-hand, graphic account of how

ammunition is moved from Eastern Europe to Africa.  Followed by

chapters on sources of supply and the mechanics of obtaining and

moving weapons, the book rounds off with detailed recommendations

of what governments can do to end this practice. 

<P>

''The prospect today for curbing violent conflict runs afoul of a

simple but powerful contradiction between the enormous damage

weapons do and the almost trivial process by which they are

acquired,'' says contributing author R.T. Naylor. 

<P>

In fact, according to the book's findings, criminals,

paramilitaries, insurgents or repressive governments produce few

weapons.  Most rely on illegal - black market - supplies for guns,

grenades, mortars and other weapons. 

<P>

''In many of the world's regions, vast stockpiles of [assault

rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and the like] circulate

and re-circulate outside of state control,'' Norwegian Red Cross

President Thorvald Stoltenberg said in the book's foreword. 

<P>

These weapons, Stoltenberg believes, are responsible for 90

percent of the world's combat related killings. 

<P>

In its 1999 report, 'Arms Availability and the Situation of

Civilians in Armed Conflict', the International Committee of the

Red Cross (ICRC) found that more than 50 percent of war casualties

in the 1990s were civilian and that small arms represented the

major contributing factor in the growing numbers of civilian

fatalities. 

<P>

As the authors point out, whilst illegal arms trafficking is not

new, the apparent increase in arms being traded is.   

<P>

The authors identify a number of trends in the 1990s - newly

opened borders, massive post-Cold War arms surpluses and the rapid

expansion of free trade - as responsible for this increase. 

<P>

This has led to territories such as Cambodia and Angola, becoming

some of the most heavily militarised and deadly countries on

earth, despite their having no industrial scale arms production. 

<P>

'Running Guns' provides for the first time a detailed critique of

the US government's cold war - and continuing - practice of

supplying arms to insurgent groups to destabilise governments it

does not favour. 

<P>

In the chapter, 'Government Gun-Running to Guerrillas', authors

Lucy Mathiak and Lora Lumpe trace the legacy of military aid by

governments to guerrillas or insurgent forces during the Cold War

era in many of today's brutal conflicts. 

<P>

''That legacy goes well beyond the billions of dollars' worth of

light weapons still in circulation and in use as a result of such

operations,'' asserts Mathiak and Lumpe. 

<P>

More importantly, ''it also encompasses complex logistical,

political and economic networks established to move weapons to

combatants while masking the true identity of the supplier

government.'' 

<P>

''Developing clear international law barring small arms supply

(usually covert) to sub-state actors would be one of the most

meaningful policies that concerned governments and NGOs could

pursue to curb further dangerous small arms proliferation,''

recommends Lumpe. 

<P>

As Lumpe points out, the US government employed this practice

routinely throughout the cold war, most devastatingly in Central

America, Afghanistan/Pakistan and Angola/Zaire conflicts, and

refuses to renounce the practice, continuing to see it as a useful

and justifiable tool of foreign policy. 

<P>

In line with this position, the US government actively opposes

proposals by Canada for an international treaty to ban gun running

by governments to insurgents.   

<P>

According to a recent US General Accounting Office report, 'US

Efforts to Control the Availability of Small Arms and Light

Weapons', for fiscal years 1996-1998, the ''United States

authorised or delivered 3.7 billion dollars in small arms and

light weapons to 154 nations through direct commercial sales,

foreign military sales; or other transfers''. 

<P>

The final section of 'Running Guns' provides a thorough round-up

of the issues and obstacles involved in tackling small arms

trafficking and comprehensive forward steps for governments to

embrace to end this practice. 

<P>

Among them, the book's authors advocate ''taking a broader view of

factors that facilitate and fuel gun-running and moving those

activities into the realm of controlled, if not prohibited''

actions. 

<P>

''Running Guns hopes to advance understanding of the illicit arms

trade in a manner that will strengthen states' resolve and

contribute to sound international policymaking in this area,''

ends Lumpe. 

<P>

'Running Guns' is a project of the Norwegian Initiative on Small

Arms Transfers - a coalition of Church AID, the Norwegian Red

Cross, the International Peace Research Institute, and the Oslo

Norwegian Institute for International Affairs.
