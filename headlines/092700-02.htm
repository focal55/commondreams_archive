WASHINGTON<wbr> - What's behind Washington's huge, expensive military intervention to

combat drugs in Colombia?

<p>Last week, the actions of the House Republican leadership suggested

one possible answer: procurement. The Republican Congress, it appears,

wants to help American defense firms sell helicopters for use in

Colombia--and to obtain the prices they want for these copters.

<p>This is not all that unusual. In fact, it's a classic example of how

Congress sometimes works harder for private defense contractors than for

taxpayers.

<p>Last summer, the Clinton administration and Congress approved the

$1.3-billion Plan Colombia, a package of aid (most of it military)

designed to bolster the Bogota government's efforts to eradicate drugs

and to combat traffickers.

<p>On Sept. 21, the House International Relations subcommittee on the

Western Hemisphere summoned representatives of the State and Defense

departments to a hearing on the progress of Plan Colombia.

<p>The executive branch officials came armed with facts and figures on

the details of the program.

<p>But they had barely started before Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-Neb.) made

plain what the Republican leadership cared most about: concluding a deal

for the use of Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.'s <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/uh-60.htm">Black Hawk</a> helicopters in

Colombia.

<p>Ordinarily, Bereuter wouldn't even have attended this hearing, because

he isn't a member of the subcommittee. But he announced that he had come

at the "personal request" of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).

<p>Hastert, he said, was dismayed that it was taking too long for

Sikorsky to obtain a contract for its Black Hawks.

<p>The Republican leadership wanted to know why there had been so many

delays. Congress had approved the purchase of 18 Black Hawk helicopters,

but U.S. officials had subsequently said they might buy a lower number.

Sikorsky was willing to sell 16 Black Hawks for $234 million, Bereuter

said.

<p>What was going on here? At first, it seemed as though the Republicans

might be concerned only about speeding up Plan Colombia. The record shows

that Hastert, to his credit, has taken a personal interest in the issue

of stopping drugs for years, even before he became the House speaker.

<p>Still, Bereuter persisted, growing more and more specific. "The

Sikorsky offer still stands, $234 million for 16 Black Hawks," he told

the executive branch officials. "Is that an understanding?"

<p>Finally, Rand Beers, assistant secretary of State for narcotics

programs, pointed to the underlying issue: In the original Plan Colombia,

$234 million was supposed to purchase 18 Black Hawks, and now Sikorsky

seemed to be proposing to supply 16 helicopters for that same $234

million.

<p>"Sikorsky is giving you a number for a lower number of helicopters,

and that's not our objective," Beers said.

<p>In short, the dispute wasn't just about timing but also about price.

And the House Republican leadership seemed to be weighing in on

Sikorsky's side in its contract negotiations with the Pentagon.

<p>This week, Sikorsky suggested that, in Bereuter's effort to help,

perhaps he had gotten his numbers wrong.

<p>"We have said consistently that we would be prepared to deliver 18

helicopters, appropriately configured, for $234 million, presuming timely

contract negotiations with the government," said Scott Seligman, a

spokesman for Sikorsky's parent company, United Technologies.

<p>The point here is not that Republican lawmakers behave differently

than the Democrats. In Congress, being solicitous of defense contractors

is a bipartisan cause.

<p>Sikorsky is located in Connecticut. Earlier this year, Connecticut's

two Democratic senators, Joseph I. Lieberman and Christopher J. Dodd,

pushed hard for Sikorsky to win congressional approval for the use of

Black Hawks in Colombia.

<p>Rather, the point is that the pressures for contracts and sales in

America's defense industry are so strong that neither of the major

parties can resist them.

<p>In the wake of the end of the Cold War, American companies have been

eager to find new sorts of missions for which they can supply planes and

helicopters. The drug war in Colombia is one such effort.

<p>"The market for military equipment abroad is not great these days, and

obviously these [helicopter] companies have to sustain their production

base," says Gabriel Marcella, a specialist on Latin America at the U.S.

Army War College.

<p>Sikorsky is merely one of many U.S. companies that hope to take part

in Plan Colombia. Last month, the Financial Times listed others, such as

Textron, which is upgrading Huey helicopters, and Lockheed Martin, which

makes early-warning systems. Other smaller, private companies will hire

former U.S. soldiers to help train the Colombian military.

<p>Nearly four decades ago, in January 1961, President Eisenhower warned

in his farewell address about the influence of what he famously called

the "military-industrial complex."

<p>What we're witnessing now is something new. It's the emergence of a

narco-industrial complex: a proliferation of U.S. companies lining up,

with congressional support, to obtain public money for anti-drug

campaigns overseas.

<p>Beware.
