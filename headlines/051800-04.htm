WASHINGTON - Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott wants his

    Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, to rein in

    Sen. Paul Wellstone for challenging how Lott runs the Senate,

    according to a report in a Capitol Hill Web publication.

       <p>Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, told Congressional

    Quarterly Thursday that Daschle isn't doing enough to control his

    ``more volatile members,'' specifically Wellstone, D-Minn., and

    Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.

       <p>The two were ``up on the edge'' of violating Senate decorum when

    they attacked the majority leader on Wednesday for not allowing

    Democrats to offer amendments on the floor, Lott said.

       <p>``I'm just tired of that,'' he said. ``I'm not going to just

    stand around and let them take potshots at me.''

       <p>Lott's comments came a day after an unusually explosive exchange

    in which Wellstone said that Lott ``wants to run the Senate as the

    House of Representatives,'' a reference to the tighter controls the

    House exerts on debate.

       <p>``I think the Senate is losing its capacity to have the

    discussions, to have debate, and to have its vitality,'' said

    Wellstone, one of the Senate's feistiest members who often blocks

    bills he opposes.

       <p>An emotional Lott said he felt ``personally maligned, and I do

    not appreciate it ... I am getting really tired of people

    questioning my commitment to the Senate and to the opportunity for

    debates, and that I am trying to be a rules committee of one.''

       <p>He said Democrats keep offering time-consuming resolutions that

    take away from the business of the Senate.

       <p>Judging from Daschle's response on the Senate floor, it's not

    likely he will try to muzzle the two liberal Democrats.

       <p>``The way the Senate is being run is wrong,'' an angry Daschle

    said Wednesday. ``No majority leader in history has attempted to

    constrain Senate debate as aggressively as Senator Lott has chosen

    to do.''

       <p>``He is trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote

    on tough issues,'' Daschle continued. ``Let's get it out on the

    table.''

       <p>On Thursday, Lott said Daschle should have a talk with

    Wellstone. Daschle's spokeswoman, Ranit Schmelzer, said that's not

    likely to happen.

       <p>And Wellstone himself was unrepentant.

       <p>Speaking on the Senate floor, Wellstone said that if Lott blames

    him for instigating Wednesday's exchange, ``I will be proud to take

    the blame. It's a discussion we needed to have.''

       <p>``What I wanted to say was I don't intend to be silent,'' he

    added. ``I intend to issue challenges and speak out.''
