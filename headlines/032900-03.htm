<p>A scientific research expedition to the Mexican coast by 20 

University of California at Davis students, scholars and environmentalists 

turned tragic when one of their boats capsized, leaving at least three 

people dead and two missing.	 

</P>

<P> Authorities said yesterday that the research party was returning to the 

remote fishing village of Bahia de los Angeles late Monday when its 22-foot 

inflatable boat capsized off the coast of Baja California about 300 miles 

south of the U.S. border.	 

</P>

<P>  Four survivors clung to the overturned boat for two hours, then spent 

three hours swimming through swells reaching six feet before reaching two 

small islands late Monday. They were rescued yesterday.	 

</P>

<P>  UC Davis administrators identified one of the dead as Michael Rose, a 

28-year-old researcher at the university's Department of Environmental 

Science and Policy. He also was a project director for <a href="http://earthwatch.org/index.html">Earthwatch Institute</a>, 

an international environmental group that works closely with UC Davis 

researchers in Mexico.	 

</P>

<P>  University officials withheld the name of the second victim, a visiting 

Japanese scholar, pending notification of relatives. A third victim, whose 

name was not released, was found later yesterday.	 

</p>

SPIDER EXPERT MISSING

<P>  One of those missing was <a href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Polis/Polis.HTM">Gary Polis</a>, the 53-year-old chairman of the 

Department of Environmental Science and Policy. He is considered one of the 

world's foremost authorities on spiders. His work has appeared in forums 

ranging from national television to children's books, and Polis himself was 

the topic of the 1994 book ``Scorpion Man.''	 

</P>

<P>  ``He's a renowned expert in the field,'' said Dr. Charles Griswold of the 

California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. ``If he is lost, it will be 

a huge loss to the field.''	 

</P>

<P>  The identity the other person who remained missing was not released.	 

</P>

<P>  The researchers were returning to Bahia de los Angeles from Isla Cabeza 

de Caballo, where they were studying spiders and scorpions. They boarded two 

inflatable Zodiac boats at midday for the four-mile trip back to the Baja 

peninsula.	 

</p>

WAVES FILLED BOATS WITH WATER

<P>  Winds gusting to 30 mph churned the sea, kicking up four-

foot to six-foot swells that caused one of the boats to fill with water and 

capsize.	 

</P>

<P>  ``It all happened within a matter of minutes. There was a big wave every 

two minutes that pounded us,'' said survivor Gary Huxel, 38, a 

post-doctorate ecology researcher at Davis.	 

</P>

<P>  After clinging to the capsized vessel for two hours, Huxel and two others 

set off for shore with life jackets and seat cushions. Huxel said Polis was 

still hanging onto the boat when he swam off.	 

</P>

<P>  Those who left the boat were soon separated by the punishing waves; Huxel 

drifted to one nearby island while the others wound up on another.	 

</P>

<P>  ``It was a long, brutal swim,'' said Rob German, whose girlfriend, 

Rebecca Lawson, survived the ordeal and recounted it to him in a phone call 

yesterday. ``(Rebecca) was pretty beat up.''	 

</P>

<P>     The other rescued survivors are UC Davis students Sarah Ratay and 

Ralph Haygood. All were found sunburned and exhausted but otherwise 

uninjured.	 

</p>

SEARCH TO RESUME TODAY

<P>  Mexican naval authorities and the Coast Guard called off their search 

last night but planned to resume this morning..	 

</P>

<P>  ``It's impossible to speculate what has happened to them,'' said Shannon 

Knight, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. ``The good news is that they're young and 

probably healthy and could have possibly swum to land. The other good thing 

is the weather has been calm.''	 

</P>

<P>  Water temperatures in the area ranged from 60 to 65 degrees. An 

average-sized person could last up to eight hours in those conditions, Coast 

Guard officials said. A person with more body fat and in good health could 

last longer.	 

</P>

<P>  Friends and colleagues remained hopeful last night that the missing would 

turn up safely.	 

</P>

<P>  ``For all we know they could be holed up on an island somewhere,'' said 

Roger V.D. Bergen, president and CEO of Earthwatch Institute.	 

</P>

<P>  Six members of Earthwatch were on the ill-fated expedition but occupied 

the boat that made it back.	 

</p>

HELICOPTER SENT TO SEARCH

<P>  The Mexican Navy had been searching for Polis and two others since 

daybreak yesterday. A body was found later in the day but no identification 

was made public. A Coast Guard helicopter arrived at the scene from San 

Diego at about 4 p.m. to assist in finding the missing pair but returned to 

Southern California as darkness fell on the Sea of Cortez.	 

</P>

<P> Polis' work has appeared in publications such as Nature, Smithsonian 

Magazine, and National Geographic Explorer. He has been hailed by 

conservationists as ``a hero to the environment.''	 

</P>

<P>  He came to UC Davis two years ago from Vanderbilt University in 

Nashville, Tenn., where he taught from 1979 until 1998.	 

</P>

<P>  Colleagues called Polis a warm, outgoing man who loved cooking Italian 

meals. His fascination with scorpions began in 1972, when he spotted one of 

the venomous creatures during a camping trip in the Santa Monica Mountains.	 

</P>

<P>  Polis began his research in Baja in the late 1980s and travelled there 

three or four times a year, university officials said. This time the 

researchers concentrated on an island off the coast of Bahia de los Angeles, 

a tourist spot and popular destination for sports fishermen and wildlife 

biologists drawn by the region's rich array of wildlife.	 

</P>

<P>  Bahia de los Angeles is so remote the town has just one telephone and 

electrical service is shut off at 10 p.m. each night.	 

</P>

<P> Rose, who died in the mishap, had helped Polis in the laboratory and in 

the field. Colleagues said Rose enjoyed playing soccer and possessed a keen 

sense of humor.	 

</P>

<P>  ``He was a great guy to be around,'' said Paul Sabatier, vice chairman of 

the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at UC Davis.	 

</P>

<P>  Bergen said Rose had gone to Mexico early to prepare for the expedition 

because of his organizational skills.	 

</P>

<P> ``He was a very detail-oriented person,'' he said. ``We had tremendous 

confidence in him -- this is the last thing anybody would have thought would 

have happened. We just felt this guy had everything down pat.''
