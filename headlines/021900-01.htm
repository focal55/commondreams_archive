<p>BEIRUT - More than 10,000 angry demonstrators

                        took to the streets on Friday for a third

                        day of protests against perceived US bias

                        toward Israel, with some students and

                        activists laying siege to the offices of

                        the American television network CNN.

<p>

                        Riot police and troops blockaded the

                        streets leading to CNN&#146;s office in

                        Verdun and beat back some 500 furious

                        demonstrators with tear gas, batons and

                        water cannons. The demonstration came a

                        day after a march on the US Embassy in

                        Awkar also ended in violence.

<p>

                        The protest began peacefully in the

                        afternoon, with thousands marching

                        through Basta to assemble in front of UN

                        House in Riad Solh. The General Labor

                        Confederation, Hizbullah, Amal, the

                        Communist Party and the Syrian Social

                        Nationalist Party joined students from

                        many universities for the protest. Even

                        the Nijmeh and Ansar soccer teams

                        participated in the march.

<p>

                        The crowds waved flags and banners

                        blasting America and Israel. Amid

                        traditional chants of &#147;Death to

                        Israel, Death to America&#148; were more

                        studied insults: &#147;You old woman,

                        take back your owl-faced

                        ambassador,&#148; yelled a group of

                        protesters referring to US Secretary of

                        State Madeleine Albright and US

                        Ambassador David Satterfield.

<p>

                        The procession, which extended for about

                        2 kilometers, rippled with banners:

                        &#147;This land is ours,&#148; (in

                        Hebrew), &#147;America and Israel are two

                        faces of the same enemy,&#148;

                        &#147;Albright, we are now

                        All-dark,&#148; &#147;Israel and America,

                        our enemies forever,&#148; &#147;and

                        &#147;Barak is a good terrorist.&#148;

                        The Israeli premier was also portrayed

                        with donkey&#146;s ears and burned in

                        effigy.

<p>

                        Youngsters leaving school joined the

                        march, as did motorists. &#147;We&#146;ve

                        reached the end of our patience,&#148;

                        said one man as he parked his Mercedes.

                        &#147;We can&#146;t take American-Israeli

                        aggression any longer.&#148;

<p>

                        A group of 500 students raced through the

                        streets toward Ras Beirut ahead of ISF

                        troopers&nbsp; toward the CNN offices in

                        the Concorde complex. Police managed to

                        cut them off less than 50 meters away

                        from the building.

<p>

                        CNN has been accused of pro-Israeli bias

                        in its coverage of the recent Israeli air

                        strikes subsequent fighting. Although

                        CNN&#146;s Brent Sadler broadcast live

                        from the Jamhour power station in the

                        aftermath of the air raids, subsequent

                        footage dwelt more on the residents of

                        northern Israel in their bomb shelters

                        and the Israeli government&#146;s

                        perspective&nbsp; rather than the

                        Lebanese view.

<p>

                        The crowd ran straight into the helmeted

                        and masked policemen, who beat them back

                        with batons, tear gas and water cannons.

                        Two students were injured.

<p>

                        An elderly woman, originally from the

                        south, whose house overlooked the scene

                        applauded the students and threw them

                        onions, lemons and shredded bed sheets,

                        antidotes to the tear gas.

<p>

                        The protesters then stood at the

                        crossroads chanting: &#147;We have to

                        tell the truth: We hate you

                        America,&#148; and &#147;Resistance is

                        our right,&#148; while holding up banners

                        parodying CNN that read: &#147;Q and A:

                        Where is the other side of the

                        story?&#148; and &#147;CNN where is your

                        Insight?&#148;

<p>

                        When a CNN cameraman appeared on the roof

                        of the building to film the

                        photographers, the crowd shouted

                        &#147;Zionist Journalism,&#148; and

                        directed obscene finger gestures at him.

<p>

                        Sadler could not be reached for comment

                        on Friday.

<p>

                        The demonstrators then proceeded toward

                        the home of Prime Minister Salim Hoss in

                        Aisha Bakar. Hoss, with a small police

                        escort, came out of his house to meet the

                        excited crowd. &#147;We&#146;re all

                        resistance,&#148; he replied to the

                        cheers of the crowd. &#147;We will not

                        surrender.&#148;

<p>

                        Raghid Adhami, an Arab University student

                        activist, noted that &#147;it&#146;s

                        ironic that there were more policemen

                        guarding the CNN offices than there were

                        guarding the prime minister.
