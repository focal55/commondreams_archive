A federal appeals court yesterday ordered a new trial for 

environmental activists who sued the Humboldt County Sheriff's 

Department for swabbing pepper spray on their eyes during a series of 

1997 protests, saying the trial judge had been wrong to rule that the 

chemical's use could not be considered excessive force.

<P>  In a 28-page decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco 

said U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker had been wrong to issue 

a verdict against the demonstrators in 1998 after the jury panel 

hearing the case had reached an impasse in its deliberations.	 

</P>

<P>  The ruling, issued by Judges Myron Bright, Harry Pregerson and 

William A. Fletcher, said the jury had failed to reach a conclusion 

about the protesters' central complaint -- that Humboldt County 

sheriff's deputies and Eureka city police had used cotton swabs 

dipped in pepper spray to paint the eyes of unarmed and nonviolent 

demonstrators during a peaceful protest.	 

</P>

<P>  Walker had erred in substituting his own judgment for that of the 

panel, they said.	 

</P>

<P>  In fact, the appellate judges said the demonstrators had provided 

ample evidence that the use of pepper spray was excessive force 

outlawed by the U.S. Constitution.	 

</P>

<P>  ``The district court's conclusion that the officers did not use 

excessive force to effect the arrests of the protesters as a matter 

of law is untenable given the evidence presented at trial,'' the 

opinion said.	 

</P>

<P>  ``It is clear to us that a `fair-minded jury could return a 

verdict for the plaintiff(s) on the evidence presented.'	 

</P>

<P>  ``Accordingly, we reverse the district court's decision to enter 

judgment,'' the judges ruled. ``We remand this action for a new 

trial.''	 

</P>

<P>  In a separate but concurring opinion, Bright said he hoped that 

the two sides would resolve the lawsuit through a negotiated 

settlement now that the appellate decision ``has established that the 

use of pepper spray in the eyes and on the faces of nonviolent, 

passive protesters may amount to an unreasonable use of force.''	 

</P>

<P>  In its decision, the appeals court made it clear that it was not 

drawing a legal precedent on whether the use of pepper spray violates 

constitutional rights. ``We are only to decide whether the district 

court erred in directing a verdict for the defendants in light of the 

evidence in the record,'' the judges wrote.	 

</P>

<P>  At the same time, there is little doubt that the ruling will cause 

law enforcement agencies to re-examine their rules for the use of 

chemical agents, particularly against political protesters who are 

passively resisting arrest while involved in demonstrations.	 

</P>

<P>  The suit stemmed from three demonstrations against the logging 

practices of Pacific Lumber Co. in September and October 1997. During 

those protests, anti-logging activists engaged in nonviolent sit-ins. 

County and city law enforcement officers sprayed aerosol pepper spray 

into some demonstrators' faces from inches away, and swabbed other 

protesters' eyes with pepper spray while removing and arresting them.	 

</P>

<P>  The anti-logging activists filed suit against the county and city 

in October 1997, charging that pepper spray is a chemical weapon 

designed to be used against violent suspects who are resisting 

arrests, not nonviolent demonstrators engaging in protected speech.	 

</P>

<P>  The case went to trial in August 1998.	 

</P>

<P>  At trial, Macon Cowles, an attorney for the protesters, said the 

two departments had ``run wild'' by using the spray in an 

experimental fashion that is not condoned by other law enforcement 

agencies.	 

</P>

<P>  ``These sheriff's deputies and police officers were working off 

the books,'' he said. ``They've got to be reined in.''	 

</P>

<P>  Lawyers for the city and county countered that the spray had been 

used properly and that no serious injuries had resulted from the 

application of the chemical.	 

</P>

<P>  ``No one is before you with a physical injury of any kind,'' said 

Nancy Delaney, an attorney representing the city and county. ``No one 

required medical treatment.''	 

</P>

<P>  After only seven hours of deliberation, the jury reported to Judge 

Walker that it was hopelessly deadlocked. The judge initially 

declared a mistrial, but later dismissed the suit after ruling that 

no reasonable juror could find that the officers involved had acted 

improperly.
