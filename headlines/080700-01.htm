WASHINGTON -- It's not so odd that a graduate 

of the 80's with a master's 

degree in economics and 

some supply-side credentials 

should now find himself  negotiating a big merger.



<p> But in this case, the merger 

would combine Ozone Action and 

Greenpeace U.S.A., one of the 

more obscure and one of the 

more famous of environmental 

organizations. The buzzwords 

might be the same as in the 

world of corporate combinations 

-- "synergy" comes to mind -- 

but the objectives could not be 

more different.

</TABLE>

</font></font>Whether or not the merger 

succeeds (the two groups' 

boards are still thinking it over), 

John Passacantando, co-founder 

and executive director of Ozone 

Action, has agreed to move to 

Greenpeace U.S.A. as its executive director. At age 38, he will take charge of 

one of the best-known franchises in environmentalism after years of upheaval in the group. 

Greenpeace U.S.A.'s entire board resigned several months ago amid disputes over the group's 

internal organization, staffing and overall direction.



<p>  Greenpeace U.S.A.'s membership is  about 

300,000, down from the  million members it 

reported several years ago. It has a budget of 

about $20 million a year, raised mostly by 

costly direct mail. Its staff numbers about five 

dozen, after reductions under its former director, Kristen Engberg.



<p>   Ozone Action is built quite differently. It  has 

no members, but a network of a few thousand 

volunteers; its budget of $1.3 million comes 

mostly from family foundations, and its staff 

numbers about a dozen.



<p>  Both groups are based in Washington, but 

Greenpeace U.S.A. reports to Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. Ozone Action focuses narrowly on  pollution that causes global 

warming or  thins the earth's protective ozone 

layer. Greenpeace's agenda is much broader, 

taking in everything, including  saving whales 

and opposing genetically modified crops.



<p> But the groups share something important, 

Mr. Passacantando said: an appreciation for 

attention-grabbing theatrics, on the streets or 

on the high seas,  in support of their  policy 

objectives.



<p> And for this sincere son of the suburbs, the 

trip to the helm of Greenpeace U.S.A.'s  ship 

meant getting used to the ruckus-raising tactics 

known in the trade as "direct action."







<p> Usually, Ozone Action's events are moderate 

in tone, like bringing ambassadors from small 

island states to seashore town meetings on 

rising ocean levels from global warming, or 

building Web pages that use government data 

to illustrate  increases in heat waves. But a few 

months ago, Mr. Passacantando,  the president 

of Friends of the Earth and a few others were 

arrested at the headquarters of the World Bank 

in Washington during protests of the April 

meetings of the international monetary organizations. They tried to hang a banner denouncing 

energy development and to disrupt traffic with 

a disabled truck.



<p> "Somehow you can find a way that is outrageous and fun, but still fair and ethical, to 

speak the truth to power," he says of such 

tactics. "That's a fun job to go to every morning."



<p> He was not  always like this. Growing up 

in Whippany, N.J., the son of a father 

who sold insurance and a mother who 

left a research job to rear him and his younger 

brother and sister, Mr. Passacantando liked to 

camp, hike and fish with his dad but was not 

 preoccupied by the environment.



<p> "I was under the false conviction, well conveyed to me during the Reagan years, that the 

era of movements was over," he said. "I had 

missed the civil rights movement, and I 

thought, 'What a shame.' "



<p>   He sold computer systems, then was hired by 

Jude Wanniski's Polyconomics Inc. to sell economic research to Wall Street. "In fact, very 

conservative research, supply-side research," 

he recalled. "It was pro-development, without any regard for 

sustainability."   



<p> Meanwhile he got a master's 

degree in economics at New 

York University. But  his world 

view was starting to change.



<p> He was reading John Muir and 

Rachel Carson, the farmer-philosopher Wendell Berry and the 

eco-spiritualist Thomas Berry. 

And he became involved "as a 

minor player" in a local development dispute in Morristown, N.J.



<p> Then Bill Moyers, the head of 

the Florence and John Schumann Foundation in Montclair, 

N.J., who is the father of Mr. 

Passacantando's first wife, took 

him aboard with the assignment 

of encouraging  "a grass-roots 

renewal of democracy." 



<p> (His current wife works on 

environmental policy in the Clinton administration.)



<p> The work brought him into 

contact with environmental advocates, people 

like Michael Clark, who was building a coalition 

to protect the Yellowstone ecosystem, and Jeff 

DeBonis, who was organizing green-leaning 

professionals in the Forest Service. 



<p> "I saw that there was, after all, a movement 

of activists all over the country; it just did not 

get through the veil," he says. "There was a 

wonderful buzz in our democracy, which I had 

not been seeing, which I did not see in college. 

This is my generation's great battle, and I 

wanted to be in the trenches."



<p> In July 1993, he co-founded Ozone Action, 

taking the name from the crisis over the ozone 

hole caused by emissions of chlorofluorocarbons. His co-founder was Karen Lohr, a Greenpeace veteran.



<p> The two groups' styles still differ considerably. Ozone Action has been training 200 students 

to  report on corporate efforts to influence the 

global warming negotiations in The Hague. 



<p>Greenpeace, meanwhile, has been driving its 

boats obstreperously into the path of a test of a 

missile defense system.



<p>  But there is  no real culture gap, says Mr. 

Passacantando, who hopes his team will fit 

right in after a merger.



<p> "Greenpeace took what the American colonists did at the Tea Party and really did develop 

it to an art form," he said. "And what you have 

now is an organization that is stabilized, that 

came out of a steep fall for the last decade, and 

really wants its leadership to get its creative 

work going again."
