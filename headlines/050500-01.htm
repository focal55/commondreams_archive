WASHINGTON - May 4   - Following the outcries against

genetically engineered crops, environmental groups are beginning

to take aim at plans underway to alter the genes of trees grown

for pulp and paper products. 

<P>

While forest-related biotech research is still in its infancy

compared with that taking place in agriculture, field trials of GM

trees have proliferated around the world during the second half of

the 1990s.  

<P>

Now environmentalists are starting to pay attention to research

links made between large biotechnology companies and the paper and

pulp industry to develop faster growing trees that could be

designed to work together with herbicides. 

<P>

Ecologists worry that the drive for profit is causing these

companies to overlook the overall impact genetically modified

trees could have on the complex workings of ecosystems.  

<P>

The economic incentive for these companies to produce trees more

quickly cannot be overemphasised, say groups which estimate the

value of the world's total annual timber harvest is in excess of

400 billion dollars.  

<P>

Environmentalists fear, for example, that new GM traits - such as

herbicide resistance - could possibly spread to other trees

through

cross fertilisation. This could cause certain trees to take over

ecosystems and cause other native species to go extinct.  

<P>

''We feel that this is a very dangerous trend in industrial

forestry and a real threat to bio-diversity, forest ecosystems and

the planet,'' says Patrick Reinsborough, outreach co-ordinator for

the California-based Rainforest Action Network.  

<P>

Last April, Monsanto Company (expected to merge with Pharmacia

Upjohn), hooked up with International Paper, Westvaco Corporation

(both based in New York) and the New Zealand-based Fletcher

Challenge Forests to form a forestry biotechnology joint venture.  

<P>

The four companies will contribute 60 million dollars over five

years to produce and market tree seedlings that they say will

improve forest health and productivity. 

<P>

Researchers will focus on altering the genetic traits of tree

species commonly planted by the forest industry worldwide, such as

eucalyptus, poplar, radiata pine, loblolly pine and sweetgum

trees, say the companies.  

<P>

Besides increasing the growth rates of tree, they plan to also

focus on making these trees tolerant to certain herbicides, much

like Monsanto's 'Round-up Ready' soy beans which are genetically

designed to survive sprayings of an herbicide it manufactures.  

<P>

They say they will also aim to improve the fibre quality and

uniformity to increase efficiency in paper and wood products

manufacturing processes.  

<P>

''Increasing the productivity of tree plantations safely and

sustainably will help meet the world's wood and fibre needs

without

increasing pressure on native forests,'' says a statement released

by Westvaco.  

<P>

But environmental groups say that just like biologically modified

corn and soy, not all the possible impacts of genetically altering

trees have been adequately studied and tested. 

<P>

''The use of genetically engineered trees intensifies the many

concerns about the use of genetically engineered crops,'' says

Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist with Environmental Defense, a

Washington-based group critical of the technology.  

<P>

Since trees grown uniformly on plantations for paper and pulp are

often nearby natural native forests, environmentalists fear that

cross pollination will be very likely. 

<P>

Goldburg says that pollen from trees are known to travel great

distances by the wind.  

<P>

''Buffer zones'' of 50 or so metres - intended to shield

traditional crops and native trees from genetically modified

pollen - as advocated by biotech companies are inadequate given

that pollen from some pine trees have been known to travel

hundreds of kilometres, she says.  

<P>

One of the proposed gene altering strategies to increase tree

growth rates involves shutting off the tree's ability to reproduce

so that all the organism's energy goes towards development instead

of fertility. If traits affecting reproduction escape to wild

trees whole species could be jeopardised, warn groups. 

<P>

''The risks of genetic pollution in our remaining native forests

are irreversible and potentially one of the greatest threats to

bio-diversity ever,'' says Mick Petrie, a campaigner with the

Native Forest Network (NFN), an advocacy group based in the state

of Vermont.  

<P>

According to NFN, companies can now alter trees to substantially

reduce lignin, a component of the cell walls in trees and other

plants that is essential for the structure of the plant, aiding in

strength and vascular functions.  

<P>

Pulp and paper companies must remove the lignin from wood pulp to

make paper. But now researchers have devised a way to genetically

disrupt a tree's production of lignin.  

<P>

''The actual processes that form lignin are poorly understood, and

how diminished production of essential enzymes within may affect

other functions is unknown,'' says NFN, in a recent newsletter to

its members. Because lignin is essential to a tree's strength,

lowering lignin could adversely affect a tree's ability to

withstand wind without damage, says the group. 

<P>

''Escape of low-lignin genes into the wild is a significant worry,

and could have devastating consequences on native forests,'' it

says.The altering of lignin production underlies that more

research is required to fill gaps in the understanding of tree

biology and ecology, say environmentalists. 

<P>

Trees are very complex organisms. Recent studies, for example,

revealed that some trees, when attacked by caterpillars, release a

chemical warning to surrounding trees, which alter the chemical

structure of their leaves to be unappealing to the caterpillars.  

<P>

''How will altering gene codes affect these and other little

understood behaviours? '' asks NFN.  

<P>

World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says that trees - unlike crops - can

take

up to hundreds of years to fully mature and are therefore subject

to a much wider range of environmental stresses, and these

stresses can in turn affect the behaviour of the modified genome. 

<P>

''At present, nobody can confidently quantify the environmental

risks surrounding genetically modified trees,'' the group says in

a report on genetically modified trees published last year.  

<P>

Given all of the unknowns, WWF is urging governments to declare a

moratorium on the commercial release of GM trees and encouraging

the industrial forest sector to do the same voluntarily. 

<P>

While calling for government regulators of biotechnology to better

consult with environmental organisations, WWF is also prodding the

paper and biotechnology industries to redesign field trials to

examine broader environmental impacts.  

<P>

''Any decision as to whether biotechnology has a role in

commercial

forestry should only be made once the risks involved are properly

identified and quantified,'' says WWF.
