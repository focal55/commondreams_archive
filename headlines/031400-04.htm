<p>PARIS  - Environment advocates from around the

world unveiled an ``<a href="http://www.earthcharter.org/">Earth Charter</a>'' Tuesday designed as a new

code of conduct for government, business and private citizens in

the globalized age.

<p>The activists, who include former Soviet President Mikhail

Gorbachev and former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, said

their 16 principles reflected growing global demand for more

moral and ethical values in business and public affairs.

<p>The anti-globalization protests at last year's World Trade

Organization summit, consumer campaigns against companies using

child labor and proliferation of non-governmental organizations

(NGOs) all reflected this new mood around the world, they said.

<p>Convinced that this sense of global interdependence was

growing, they said they would present the charter over the next

few years to the United Nations, governments, businesses,

schools and NGOs as the basis for new laws and codes of conduct.

<p>``We need a moral and ethical recovery, not just an

economic recovery,'' Maurice Strong, co-chairman of the Earth

Charter Commission, said after the group agreed on the final

text following a three-day meeting in Paris.

<p>Steven Rockefeller, a U.S. academic and philanthropist, said

the world was moving in two different directions, with booming

economies in developed countries and persistent poverty and

environmental destruction in the Third World.

<p>``These two trends cannot continue without engulfing us

all,'' he said. ``The Earth Charter presents an integrated

vision.''

<p>Participants told a news conference in Paris that many of

the broad principles outlined in the Earth Charter had already

been espoused by NGOs and used to pressure large corporations

and associations to change their ways of operating.

<p>``CEOs and boards of directors are beginning to understand

they have to change and need new codes of conduct,'' said

Lubbers, noting how Shell responded to criticism of its plan to

sink the Brent Spar oil platform or Nike came under fire for

alleged child labor in its Asian shoe factories.

<p>Strong said groups as diverse as the World Federation of

Engineering Associations and the World Tourism and Travel

Council had inserted Earth Charter principles in their policies.

<p>The Earth Charter, which grew out of the Rio summit's

failure to draw up a binding charter on the environment, aims to

be a long-term basis for environmental policies similar to the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights for democratic policy.

<p>Its principles are broadly worded guidelines such as

''respect Earth and life in all its diversity'' and ``build

democratic societies that are just, sustainable, participatory

and peaceful.''

<p>``The Earth Charter is a vehicle for changing the mentality

of generations to come,'' said Alexander Likhotal of Russia, who

represented Gorbachev at the meeting.
