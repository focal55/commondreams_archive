SACRAMENTO --        By nearly 4 to 1, Californians favor 

stopping state executions to study how the death penalty is applied, 

according to a Field Poll released today.

<P>  Although Californians still favor the death penalty 2 to 1, the 

support for a moratorium reflects a growing national worry that the 

legal system's ultimate penalty may be snaring the innocent along 

with the guilty.	 

</P>

<P>  ``This crosses party lines, gender lines and ethnic lines,'' said 

Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll.	 

</P>

<P>  The surprising results show that not only do 83 percent of 

Democrats favor a temporary ban on executions, but so do 62 percent 

of Republicans, usually the staunchest death penalty backers.	 

</P>

<P>  Of women polled, 76 percent favor the moratorium, while 71 percent 

of men support it.	 

</P>

<P>  Despite the poll results, Gov. Gray Davis will not back a 

moratorium, said his spokeswoman, Hilary McLean.	 

</P>

<P>  ``A majority of Californians share the governor's view that the 

death penalty is appropriate in certain instances and should be the 

law of the land,'' McLean said.	 

</P>

<P>  Like GOP Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Davis, a Democrat, has said 

that California's handling of death penalty cases has sufficient 

safeguards to ensure a convicted murderer's guilt.	 

</p>

EMERGENCE OF THE ISSUE

<P>  Capital punishment has leaped to national prominence this year 

after Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a longtime death 

penalty supporter, halted executions in his state on January 31.	 

</P>

<P>  Ryan made his decision after 13 wrongfully condemned inmates in 

Illinois were freed over the past 13 years.	 

</P>

<P>  His move sparked legislative efforts in several other states for 

moratoriums and national publicity about death row prisoners and 

their cases.	 

</P>

<P>  After Ryan imposed the ban, a group of religious leaders, 

including Cardinal Roger Mahoney of Los Angeles, called on Davis to 

follow suit.	 

</p>

ISSUE DOGS BUSH	 

<P>  The issue has also dogged Bush's presidential quest. He has 

presided over 134 executions in Texas since 1995 and was confronted 

with death penalty protesters on his campaign swing through 

California this week.	 

</P>

<P>  Bush will return today to _®Øs, ,where he must consider the 

scheduled execution of Gary Graham. Graham was convicted of a 1981 

murder despite no physical evidence linking him to the slaying and 

proof that a gun in his possession was not the murder weapon. 	 

</P>

<P>  In California, there are 560 people on death row -- the largest 

number in the nation.	 

</P>

<P>  Since Davis became governor in 1999, three people have been 

executed. All sought clemency, and Davis denied each request. Two of 

those seeking clemency did not claim to be innocent of their crimes.	 

</p>

POLL PROCEDURE	 

<P>  The question asked by the Field Poll referred to the national 

debate on capital punishment.	 

</P>

<P>  ``In recent months, the governor of Illinois halted all executions 

in his state because it was found that there were a number of cases 

where inmates on death row did not appear to be guilty as a result of 

DNA testing procedures,'' poll respondents were told.	 

</P>

<P>  ``In California, a number of religious leaders and others have 

asked Gov. Davis to impose a similar moratorium. Would you favor or 

oppose Gov. Davis halting all executions until a study of (capital 

punishment's) fairness in California were carried out?'' 	 

</P>

<P>  DiCamillo said it was the first time a question about a moratorium 

on executions had been asked in a Field Poll, although the poll has 

tracked public sentiment toward the death penalty since 1956.	 

</P>

<P>  Support for the death penalty was at its highest in the 1980s, 

when the state's incidence of crime was also at its peak. Support 

reached a high of 83 percent in 1986.	 

</P>

<P>  That level fell to 63 percent in the most recent poll, with the 

proportion of those opposed to capital punishment more than doubling 

from 14 percent in 1986 to 30 percent today. 	 

</p>

QUESTIONING THE POLL	 

<P>  McLean, Davis' spokeswoman, questioned the phrasing of the 

moratorium issue.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Look at how the question was framed,'' McLean said. ``It 

outlines problems found in a different state and attaches another 

statement about California. California is not Illinois.''	 

</P>

<P>  McLean said California has plenty of procedural safeguards to 

ensure the guilt of convicted death row inmates, including automatic 

appeals to the state Supreme Court and the opportunity for further 

appeals in federal court.	 

</P>

<P>  In the 10 years since 1986, when former Chief Justice Rose Bird 

and two of her liberal colleagues were ousted from the court by 

voters, the state's high court upheld 184 of 216 death sentences. 

From 1977 to 1986, the Bird court reversed 64 of 68 death sentences.
