PHILADELPHIA<wbr>--<wbr>It's 8 a.m., and the revolution is being shown on public access

channels.

<p>Radio host Amy Goodman, seated at a table draped with a blanket, opens

<a href="http://democracynow.org/">her show</a> by reading political headlines on the air, casually dropping the

name of the hotel housing the GOP's largest corporate donors and chatting

up a string of protesters, all while a cameraman zaps her image to a

rented satellite truck waiting outside.

<p>But unlike the stars of network television, she's not reading from a

script in a sky box above the delegates at First Union Center. She's in a

corner of the Independent Media Center, a shoestring-budget newsroom run

out of a downtown apartment building here.

<p>Even as TV news vans raced around the city Monday filming a march

against homelessness, local activists contend the major news

organizations camped out in Philadelphia are writing them off. So they

are trying to shine their own spotlight on the demonstrations with

alternative newspaper, television and radio programs. More than 400

people have signed up at the center to write articles, shoot footage or

sound off on the airwaves.

<p>"What we're trying to do is create a platform where other voices can

be heard," said Brian Drolet, an organizer with the Free Speech TV

channel, which is carrying the satellite broadcast. If media

consolidation results in homogenous news stories, he says, "it doesn't

matter how many channels you have."

<p>Part of what drives the independent media movement, which also covered

demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, is the

concern that the major print and electronic media's corporate owners will

censor stories that are critical of the companies' interests. But

Philadelphia's independent media center plays a dual role that would run

afoul of ethical boundaries at most professional news organizations: In

addition to providing a base for the demonstrators' documentary crews and

radio chats, it houses their public relations arm.

<p>The activists' "coverage is not influenced by who owns the mechanism

for the message," said Amy Hammersmith, 31, a volunteer writer and editor

for the newspaper.

<p>On the other hand, the activists' work reflects the authors' approval

of the protests they're covering. Saturday's edition of the Unconvention

newspaper, for example, featured largely positive stories about a tent

city activists built for the homeless, past convention protests and a

news conference by the so-called R2K protest leaders.

<p>When asked if the newspaper is weighted to promote the demonstrators,

Hammersmith said "it's impossible not to have a lens. I think the word I

like to [emphasize] is accuracy, instead of objectivity."

<p>The Independent Media Center's drab loft-style space in central

Philadelphia is a far cry from the labyrinth of trailers and

air-conditioned tents accommodating 15,000 accredited journalists

encircling the First Union Center. Writers are typing on computers lugged

from home. Organizers are shouting orders on a sound system borrowed from

Hammersmith's boyfriend's band. And one volunteer slept amid cardboard

boxes Monday morning across the room from Goodman's jury-rigged radio

studio as her show went live.

<p>The would-be reporters also face some major hurdles in gathering news.

They don't have credentials to cover the convention itself. And the

7,000-circulation newspaper failed to come out Sunday when they couldn't

find an open printer.

<p>But technology is widening the center's reach. Goodman's two-hour

program was beamed to the 3.1 million homes subscribing to the Dish

Network, 30 public access cable channels around the country, dozens of

radio stations in the Pacifica Network and the Internet.

<p>"This is a chance to expose the raw anatomy of power," Goodman said.

"If you think the story is money in politics, [the convention] is where

the news is being made. This is what democracy looks like in America

today."
