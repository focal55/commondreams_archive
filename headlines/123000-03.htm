WASHINGTON  -- They call him ''traitor,'' ''egomaniac'' and

''fool.'' Some of Ralph Nader's old battle buddies even call him

''politician.''

<p>

   Many of those who fought with Nader on the frontlines for the

environment, consumer rights and other liberal causes now say he

betrayed them by not ending his presidential run in time to save Al

Gore's candidacy. And they say his career as a public advocate is

through.

<p>

   ''Who's going to work with him now?'' snorted Rep. John Conyers,

D-Mich., a powerful congressman who once worked with Nader on labor

and regulatory issues.

<p>

   The iconoclast's idol is undergoing the kind of beating he once

trademarked, but Nader could care less.

<p>

   ''They were all anesthetized by Clinton, the snake charmer,''

said the man who described Gore and Bush as ''Tweedledum and

Tweedledee.''

<p>

   In an interview in his cramped campaign office -- just blocks

from his cramped Washington bachelor's pad -- Nader sounded the same

themes that informed his campaign: the two major parties are

beholden to corporate interests, and voters lacked choice.

<p>

   ''The Democrats were moving toward the Republican Party,

developing Republican agendas for Republican issues -- to take

Republican voters away,'' he said.

<p>

   That elicits moans from his former allies, who agree with him

that much was wrong with the Democratic Party -- but who say

differences are real, and now very very evident, thanks to the man

they still affectionately call ''Ralph.''

<p>

   Each starts by mentioning Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, whose

controversial civil rights record is already dogging his attorney

general nomination. They also point to Andrew Card, a former

automobile industry lobbyist named as White House chief of staff,

and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney's oil industry past.

<p>

   ''We all complained how Clinton gave a green light to industry,

but it can be greener,'' said Ken Cook, who heads the Environmental

Working Group.

<p>

   Nader now concedes that Bush will cause more damage than Gore.

<p>

   ''Bush is probably going to jettison the tobacco lawsuits, and

he's not good on energy,'' he said.

<p>

   That's a major departure from his insistence that Gore and Bush

were two sides of the same coin. Having made the concession, Nader

-- who avoids eye-contact like an oncoming Ford Pinto -- started

scribbling notes to himself, and said a Bush presidency will at

least galvanize liberals.

<p>

   ''Oh yeah,'' Conyers said scornfully. ''Now that we're not

anesthetized, Ralph, we want to work real close and take

instructions from you.''

<p>

   Not all in the advocacy community blame Nader.

<p>

   Maggie Geist of the Association for the Preservation of Cape Cod

blames Gore for straying from his strong pro-environment record in

a misguided attempt to win the center.

<p>

   ''He will have to explain to himself why he chose not to

highlight that during his campaign,'' she said.

<p>

   Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen, a consumer group, and

once a close Nader ally, is also wary of a Bush presidency -- but

she blames Gore's poor performance.

<p>

   ''You have to ask why he didn't win by a landslide, why he

wouldn't let Clinton campaign in Arkansas,'' she said.

<p>

   Nader's detractors readily agree that Gore misstepped -- but they

say that pales next to Nader's willfulness.

<p>

   ''Nader was never the only factor (in Gore's defeat),'' said

Cook. ''But it was the only factor that was a betrayal.''

<p>

   Nader had his strongest support in a handful of states -- Oregon,

Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan. Gore ultimately won all

five, but only after being forced to spend precious time and money

there. Meanwhile, Nader only took 2 percent in Florida -- a state

that was never considered a Nader stronghold -- but that was enough

to throw the state to Bush.

<p>

   Some say Nader strayed from his original aim of establishing the

Green Party as a national force, and let his personal dislike for

Gore color his judgment.

<p>

   Gary Sellers, a retired activist whose friendship with Nader

dates back to the 1960s -- Nader was the best man at his wedding --

says Nader hinted last summer that he would withdraw if it were

getting close.

<p>

   ''He said, 'Oh, Gary, don't worry about it,'' Sellers said.

<p>

   When it became clear in October that Nader had no such

intention, Sellers established Nader's Raiders for Gore. He now

describes Nader as an ''egomaniac'' seduced by one more stab at the

national spotlight, and says he lied to his constituents about

Gore's record -- just like the establishment politicians he once

reviled.

<p>

   ''You don't throw the country away'' to prove a point, Sellers

said, noting that Bush could appoint as many as 600 federal judges.

<p>

   Peter Petkas, a Houston businessman and a Nader's Raider in the

1970s, said the same single-mindedness that drove Nader to heroic

victories in those days undid the election.

<p>

   ''Ralph didn't see a way out, he locked himself in,'' he said.

Petkas says he suffers the consequences of the ex-Texas governor's

deregulatory fervor on a daily basis -- Houston is the nation's

smoggiest city.

<p>

   Nader says pulling out would have betrayed the Greens. ''The

campaign built the basis for a long-range political reform

movement.''

<p>

   Notably, he does not use the word ''party'' -- the Greens fell

well short of getting the 5 percent needed to qualify for federal

matching funds, and they elected just 20 people to local office,

including a sewage commissioner.

<p>

   For some, those numbers spell the last of Nader. Norm Shiren, a

retiree in Chappaqua, N.Y., modeled his modest local environmental

activism on Nader's. No longer.

<p>

   ''Nader ended up throwing the election to someone who is going

to do everything to ruin his issues,'' he said.
