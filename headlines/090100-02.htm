LONDON - Global warming could wipe out many species of 

plants and animals by the end of the 

21st century, the World Wide Fund 

for Nature said in a report issued 

here yesterday.



<p> The fund, known in the United 

States as the World Wildlife Fund, 

paints a devastating picture of the 

ability of species from Arctic polar 

bears and walruses to New England 

sugar maple trees to survive unless 

they can migrate quickly or adapt to 

their new environments. 



<p>     The predictions are based on the 

standard assumption -- which some 

experts say should be revised -- that 

by 2100, carbon dioxide emissions 

into the atmosphere will be double 

what they were at the start of the 

Industrial Revolution.



<p> They also rely on climate models 

that lose precision when assessing 

regional impacts of a warming global climate.



<p>      Particularly at risk in addition to 

rare species, the report indicates, 

are those living in mountainous or 

isolated places. Among those singled 

out as vulnerable are the Gelada 

baboon in Ethiopia; the monarch 

butterfly, which spends winters in 

Mexico; the Australian mountain 

pygmy possum; the northern spruce 

in New York State; and the spoonbilled sandpiper, which breeds in the 

far northeastern reaches of Russia.



<p>      According to the report, as much 

as 70 percent of the natural habitat 

could be lost, and 20 percent of the 

species rendered extinct, in the Arctic and northernmost areas of places 

like Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where warming is predicted to 

be most rapid.



<p> Places farther south, including 

parts of Sweden, Finland, Estonia, 

Latvia, Iceland and Kyrgyzstan, 

could lose more than half of their 

natural habitat. 



<p>    In the United States, the report 

predicts, more than a third of the 

existing habitat in Maine, New 

Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, 

Oklahoma and Texas could be irrevocably altered by global warming. 



<p>      "Rapid rates of global warming 

are likely to increase rates of habitat 

loss and species extinction, most 

markedly in the higher latitudes of 

the Northern Hemisphere," the report reads. 



<p>  Jennifer L. Morgan, director of the 

World Wildlife Fund Climate Change 

Campaign in Washington, says that 

to survive into the following century, 

some species would have to migrate 

10 times faster than after the last ice 

age.



<p>      "Climate change is coming at us 

much faster than many habitats are 

going to be able handle," Ms. Morgan 

said.
