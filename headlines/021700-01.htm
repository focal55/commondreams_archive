<p>In a major boost for the forces of

economic globalisation, US President Bill Clinton has decided to

back multinational corporations in a key court challenge to a

Massachusetts law designed to promote democracy in Burma.

<P>

   In a brief quietly filed with the Supreme Court Tuesday,

Clinton's Justice Department charged that cities and states which

make it more difficult for companies doing business in repressive

countries to win procurement contracts "impermissibly intrude into

the national government's exclusive authority over foreign

affairs." 

<P>

   Joining a coalition of some 600 major multinational

corporations, the European Union (EU) and Japan, the

administration

asked the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments on the

case

March 22, to declare the Massachusetts law unconstitutional. A

final judgment by the nine-member court is expected in June. 

<P>

   The case, called "Natsios versus the National Foreign Trade

Council (NFTC)," has major implications for grassroots human

rights

and other US activist groups, which over the past 25 years have

used state and local "selective-purchasing" laws to influence the

behaviour of multi-national corporations abroad. 

<P>

   Selective-purchasing laws are designed to force companies to

choose between continuing to do business with repressive foreign

governments and bidding on often-lucrative state or local

government contracts. The Massachusetts law, for example, adds 10

percent to any bid by a target companies - foreign and domestic -

on a state procurement contract. 

<P>

   Such laws were used most successfully during the late 1970s and

1980s to force scores of US multinationals - including such giants

as Coca-Cola, IBM, and General Motors - to withdraw from South

Africa because of apartheid. The resulting divestment, according

to most experts, played a crucial role in bringing about majority

rule. 

<P>

   Similar laws in New York, California, Pennsylvania and other

states and cities targeting Swiss banks and insurance companies

which had failed to adequately account to Nazi Holocaust victims

and their families helped prompt a settlement of outstanding

claims

in 1998. 

<P>

   Some two dozen states and cities, including New York, Los

Angeles, and San Francisco - which each year put hundreds of

millions of dollars in contracts up for bids - have enacted

selective-purchasing laws against companies doing business in

Burma, where a military junta has repressed the democratic

opposition led by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. 

<P>

   Multinationals naturally oppose these initiatives because they

curb their freedom to do business where they like. But until now,

they were reluctant to challenge the laws in court due to the

negative publicity that could result from a company claiming a

right to do business with abusive governments. 

<P>

   In 1998, however, the NFTC filed a case in federal court

challenging the 1996 Massachusetts law on the grounds that it

violated US constitutional provisions which gave the federal

government the power to regulate foreign commerce and foreign

policy. In an unprecedented step, the EU and Japan filed amicus

curiae (friend of the court) briefs on the NFTC's behalf. 

<P>

   At the same time, Brussels and Tokyo also filed their own

challenges to the law with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in

Geneva. They claimed that Massachusetts, by enacting the law, had

violated the WTO's 1995 Government Procurement Agreement (GPA),

which forbids states from using non-economic criteria in deciding

contract bids. 

<P>

   The Clinton administration, deeply split on the issue, stayed

out of the case. While strong supporters of globalisation, like

the

Treasury and Commerce Departments, argued for backing the NFTC,

other offices, especially in the State Department and the National

Security Council, opposed taking any position. 

<P>

   In a letter to state officials in April 1998, Secretary of

State

Madeleine Albright expressed the administration's deep

ambivalence. 

<P>

   "Our challenge," she wrote, "is to ensure that America speaks

with a single voice." She also noted, however, that "President

Clinton and I recognise the authority of state and local officials

to determine their own investment and procurement policies, and

the

right - indeed their responsibility - to take moral considerations

into account as they do so." 

<P>

   The latter position is the one taken by Massachusetts in the

case. "The states should be free...to apply a moral standard to

their spending decisions," according to a brief filed by the

state,

which, in a rare breach of legal protocol, was not informed in

advance by the administration - apparently to avoid publicity - of

its own submission. 

<P>

   "Nothing in the federal Constitution...requires the states to

trade with dictators," argues the Massachusetts brief, which is

supported by amicus briefs from more than two dozen states and

cities, some 24 members of Congress, and a plethora of human

rights

and labour groups. 

<P>

   The Clinton administration brief stresses that it, too,

strongly

opposes the current government in Burma and has imposed trade and

other sanctions against it. 

<P>

   "The disagreement," according to the brief, "is only over

whether the State could permissibly take the sort of action

reflected in the Massachusetts Burma Act." 

<P>

   Citing complaints against the law by the EU, Japan, and the

Association for Southeast Asian Nations, the administration goes

onto argue that it has "complicated (US) efforts to develop a

multilateral strategy" and thus "impermissibly infringe(s) upon

the

national government's exclusive authority to conduct foreign

affairs." 

<P>

   "Indeed, if the (Act) were sustained, a multitude of different,

and differing state and local measures sanctioning foreign

governments could be expected," the brief states, adding that

similar selective-purchasing statutes have been or adopted or

considered against companies doing business in China, Cuba, Egypt,

Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Morocco, Nigeria, North Korea,

Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Switzerland, Tibet, Turkey, and

Vietnam. 

<P>

   The administration's arguments echo those made by the two

courts

which have considered the case to date. In November 1998, US

federal court judge Joseph Tauro ruled that "State interests, no

matter how noble, do not trump the federal government's exclusive

foreign affairs power." 

<P>

   Last June, in a more sweeping decision, a three-judge federal

appeals court in Boston found that "the conduct of this nation's

foreign affairs cannot be effectively managed on behalf of all the

nation's citizens if each of the many state and local governments

pursues its own foreign policy." 

<P>

   But supporters of the Act remain confident. "This could

actually

backfire against the administration," noted Robert Stumberg, a

professor at Georgetown Law Centre. "Some justices who might have

been more sympathetic to the administration's case may now be more

inclined to see in this a major extension of federal power at the

expense of state and local authorities." 

<P>

   The Court's majority consists of justices appointed by

Republican presidents, who generally have been more solicitous of

state and local rights. Ironically, President Ronald Reagan's

attorney-general, a strong supporter of apartheid South Africa,

opposed a constitutional challenge to the selective-purchasing

laws

against Pretoria for precisely that reason. 

<P>

   "The administration's brief amounts to an unparalleled attack

by the federal government on state sovereignty and local democracy

and really makes a sharp contrast with even the Reagan

administration's view that selective-purchasing laws were

constitutional," says Simon Billeness, a financial analyst in

Boston who has led the anti-Burma campaign there. 

<P>

   Whatever the Supreme Court decides, however, the case's main

impact may actually work against the WTO, which was already badly 

wounded by the debacle of its Seattle meeting last December, 

according to Stumberg. 

<P>

   In 1994, when the administration was negotiating with Congress 

over Washington's membership in the WTO, it offered assurances to 

the attorneys-general of all 50 US states that private  

corporations 

could not sue states in connection with WTO agreements, including 

any constitution-based challenges to state laws. 

<P>

   "To get it through Congress, that's what the US Trade 

Representative agreed to," said Stumberg. "Now the fact that the 

administration is lining up with the corporations will not help  

the 

USTR's credibility when new trade agreements come up."
