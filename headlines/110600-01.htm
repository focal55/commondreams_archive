WASHINGTON  -- Nearing the end of his longshot campaign for the U.S. presidency, Ralph Nader on Sunday joined thousands of Green Party supporters for a boisterous rally in ''the last American colony.''

</font>More than 12,000 people gathered in the heart of the nation's capital for four hours of progressive politics, cheering as Nader and his celebrity supporters dismissed arguments that a vote for Nader is a vote for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.





<p>``If you don't win on Tuesday, Mr. Gore, it won't be because

of Ralph Nader,'' said Michael Moore, the liberal filmmaker. ``It

will be because of you, Mr. Gore.''

<p>Moore argued that with 35 years experience as an activist,

Nader was inherently more qualified than either Bush or Gore, a

theme echoed by former TV host Phil Donahue, actor Danny Glover

and rock musician Patti Smith.

<p>They also minimized the differences between the major-party

candidates, filling the MCI Center with repeated denunciations

of the ``Republicrats.''

<p>``A vote for Nader means the buck stops here ... that we're

not willing to play the game of lesser of two evils,'' actor

Danny Glover said, quoting extensively from Langston Hughes,

the great Harlem Renaissance poet.

<p>With Nader hovering at about 5 percent in most national

polls, but drawing significant support in Oregon, Michigan and

other toss-up states, his rag-tag campaign has increasingly

worried associates of Democrat Al Gore.

<p>In an address that went on for more than an hour, Nader

regaled the mostly white, 20-something crowd with some of his

favorite themes, arguing for an increase in the minimum wage,

stricter consumer and environmental regulations, universal

health care and an end to the war on drugs.

<p>But, as he has been prone to do, Nader seized the

opportunity to criticize the power and influence of American

businesses.

<p>``Corporations were designed to be our servants, not our

masters,'' Nader said, surrounded by ads for the giant

corporations that bankroll the local Washington Wizards

basketball team and Capitals hockey team.

<p>``We can and must stop this corporate welfare that is coming

out of Washington, a bustling bazaar of accounts receivable for

these corporations,'' Nader said.

<p>The rally also served as a national platform for local

activists working to secure statehood for the District of

Columbia, a city of more than 500,000 that depends on

Congressional largesse for many of its operations, yet lacks a

voting representative in either legislative chamber.
