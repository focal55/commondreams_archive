BAGHDAD  - A senior U.N. official said Friday about

half a million children under the age of 5 have died in Iraq

since the imposition of U.N. sanctions 10 years ago.

<p>Anupama Rao Singh, country director for the U.N. Children's

Fund (UNICEF), made the estimate in an interview with Reuters.

<p>``In absolute terms we estimate that perhaps about half a

million children under 5 years of age have died, who ordinarily

would not have died had the decline in mortality that was

prevalent over the 70s and the 80s continued through the 90s,''

she said.

<p>A UNICEF survey published in August showed the mortality

rate among Iraqi children under 5 had more than doubled in the

government-controlled south and center of Iraq during the

sanctions.

<p>Baghdad said the UNICEF survey proved that the sanctions

were killing thousands of children every month and called for an

immediate end to the embargo.

<p>Rao Sigh blamed malnutrition for the high mortality rate

among children.

<p>``Nutrition was not a public health problem in Iraq in the

80s. It emerged as a major problem in the 90s and it increased

steadily till about 1996,'' Singh said.

<p>She said since the start of the U.N. oil-for-food program,

malnutrition rates among children had stabilized, but death

rates remained extremely high.

<p>``One in four children below 5 suffers from some form of

malnutrition or other and most of them are chronically

malnourished,'' Rao Singh said.

<p>Sanctions were imposed on Iraq as punishment for its 1990

invasion of Kuwait, although the United Nations has allowed Iraq

to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian

supplies.

<p>Rao Singh said the sanctions also have affected the quality

of education, with many children forced to leave schools to

hustle a living on the streets.

<p>``There has been a drop in enrollment, an increase in drop-

outs ... children working, children in the street -- all of

which, we believe, is going to affect the quality of human

resources that Iraq will have in the future,'' she said.

<p>According to Rao Singh, the sanctions have caused massive

impoverishment except for a small proportion of the elite. ``The

majority of middle class people in Iraq, for instance, now find

themselves having to do all sorts of mean and insecure jobs to

survive,'' she said.
