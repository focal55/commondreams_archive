<p>In a rare defection, a group of Democratic stalwarts Monday

denounced their party's decision to contribute heavily to a campaign to

defeat a political reform initiative on Tuesday's ballot.

<p>At a news conference in Los Angeles, former Secretary of State March

Fong Eu, longtime Democratic financial backers Stanley Sheinbaum and Max

Palevsky and pollster Pat Caddell accused the party hierarchy of being

out of step with rank-and-file members who overwhelmingly support

campaign finance reform.

<p>All four are backers of Proposition 25, a reform initiative sponsored

by millionaire Ron Unz and former acting Secretary of State Tony Miller.

<p>"I'm just so embarrassed by what they [party officials] did," said Eu.

"It sends a very regrettable message to the people of California that the

California Democratic Party opposes the reform."

<p>Late last week in an unprecedented move, party leaders dumped $500,000

into the campaign against Proposition 25 to counteract a $1-million

donation Palevsky had given backers of the initiative the day before.

<p>Party officials insisted that they supported campaign finance reform

but could not back the Unz-Miller proposal because it provided some

taxpayer financing of initiatives.

<p>Palevsky said he is so outraged by the party's action that when the

primary is over he intends to denounce it in full-page advertisements in

newspapers statewide. He said the headline on the ads will be one word in

bold black letters: <b>Shame.

</b>

<p>Proposition 25 would tighten political fund-raising by setting

contribution limits, banning corporate donations, providing blackout

periods, requiring frequent disclosure and offering taxpayer-financed

advertising credits to campaigns that agree to spending limits.
