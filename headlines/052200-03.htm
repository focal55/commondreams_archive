TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP)  Though national environmental groups are

&nbsp;embracing Al Gore, some grass-roots conservationists are

&nbsp;contemplating a protest vote for Ralph Nader - a gesture that could

&nbsp;end up helping George W. Bush in Western states.

&nbsp;

<p>   Nader, a Green Party candidate, is winning support from people

&nbsp;who normally vote Democratic by pressing hardline environmental

&nbsp;proposals on forest policy and other subjects.

&nbsp;

<p>   For example, during a campaign stop here along the Sierra

&nbsp;Nevada's eastern front, he won applause when he said, "I don't

&nbsp;believe there should be logging in federal forests, period." He

&nbsp;also advocated sweeping mine reform.

&nbsp;

<p>   The consumer advocate, who got his start taking on the auto

&nbsp;industry, increasingly is taking aim at Gore's environmental record

&nbsp;- an area thought to be a Gore strength.

&nbsp;

<p>   "He wrote a book in 1992 (Earth in the Balance), that he

&nbsp;completely turned his back on," Nader said during a speech at the

&nbsp;University of Nevada, Reno.

&nbsp;

<p>   The message seems to be resonating with some environmental

&nbsp;liberals who view President Clinton and his vice president as

&nbsp;dealmakers too quick to compromise.

&nbsp;

<p>   "Most of my folks are going to vote for Nader. They will never

&nbsp;vote for Al Gore again," said Tim Hermach, executive director of

&nbsp;the Native Forest Council in Eugene, Ore.

&nbsp;

<p>   Sixteen percent of the old-growth forest that existed when

&nbsp;Clinton imposed his Northwest forest plan has now been logged "on

&nbsp;the way to clearcutting 55 percent of the old-growth we had when he

&nbsp;started," Hermach said.

&nbsp;

<p>   "I think the worst, dumbest Republican is better for us because

&nbsp;we don't perceive him to be our friend."

&nbsp;

<p>   While it's hard to measure Nader's impact, a poll last month in

&nbsp;Oregon - a state that has backed the Democratic presidential

&nbsp;candidate in the past three elections - had Bush at 40 percent,

&nbsp;Gore at 37 and Nader at 7, with a margin of error of plus or minus

&nbsp;4.5 points. Gore and Bush are tied in Washington, another

&nbsp;environmentally conscious state that has voted Democratic in the

&nbsp;past three presidential elections.

&nbsp;

<p>   The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters haven't

&nbsp;decided whether to endorse Gore. But they are leaning that way and

&nbsp;doing their best to defend him against detractors.

&nbsp;

<p>   Among the largest national groups, only Friends of the Earth,

&nbsp;which endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primary, appears to

&nbsp;be realistically weighing a Nader endorsement.

&nbsp;

<p>   A national poll by Zogby International last month found Nader

drawing 6 percent - slightly more than Pat Buchanan's 4 percent -&nbsp;in a field with Bush at 43 percent and Gore at 39. The poll had a

&nbsp;margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.

&nbsp;

<p>   One of Nader's goals is to pull 5 percent or more of the

&nbsp;national vote, which would qualify him for millions in federal

&nbsp;campaign funds.

&nbsp;

<p>   The Gore campaign and its mainstream environmental allies argue

&nbsp;that a vote for Nader is ultimately a vote for Bush, whose record

&nbsp;as Texas governor hardly endears him to conservationists.

&nbsp;

<p>   In addition to Bush's ties to the oil industry, critics point to

&nbsp;Texas' bad air quality, and particularly Houston's crown as the

&nbsp;nation's smog capital of 1999. The League of Conservation Voters

&nbsp;argues that Bush opposed the Kyoto treaty on global warming, worked

&nbsp;to make some Texas air pollution regulations voluntary and

&nbsp;generally advocates a reduced role in environmental enforcement and

&nbsp;regulation.

&nbsp;

<p>   "I'm not sure Ralph Nader has been paying too much attention,"

&nbsp;said Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. "The most productive thing

&nbsp;for an environmentalist to do is to support Al Gore."

&nbsp;

<p>   But some activists say they've been taken for granted by a

&nbsp;Clinton-Gore administration too ready to compromise away old-growth

&nbsp;forests and other habitat for endangered wildlife.

&nbsp;

<p>   Environmentalists in the Sierra Nevada, organized under the

&nbsp;national group American Lands, don't endorse candidates. But

&nbsp;leaders say many will vote for Nader.

&nbsp;

<p>   Brian Vincent, California organizer for American Lands, was

&nbsp;among those who had trumpeted Clinton's proposal to protect

&nbsp;roadless areas in national forests. But he's changed his tune.

&nbsp;

<p>   "We think the administration is talking out of both sides of

&nbsp;its mouth," he said.

&nbsp;

<p>   Clinton unveiled the roadless initiative in October not long

&nbsp;after Friends of the Earth endorsed Bradley.

&nbsp;

<p>   "I think it is pretty obvious it is an election-year ploy to

&nbsp;get environmental endorsements," said Fraser Shilling, a Sierra

&nbsp;Club member who coordinates a research program on land use at the

&nbsp;University of California-Davis.

&nbsp;

<p>   The Sierra Club's national board has identified Bush as the

&nbsp;enemy but hasn't decided whether to endorse Gore over Nader.

&nbsp;

<p>   "If they both take us in the right direction, the question

&nbsp;becomes who can excite people and compel people to vote?"

&nbsp;executive director Carl Pope said from San Francisco.

&nbsp;

<p>   Deb Callahan, executive director of the League of Conservation

Voters, said Gore might have been the victim of inflated

&nbsp;expectations.

&nbsp;

<p>   "Sometimes, advocates who don't really understand the stakes in

&nbsp;some of these policy fights don't acknowledge the role a politician

&nbsp;has to play in forging something that can be passed by Congress,"

&nbsp;she said.
