<p>Tony Blair has acknowledged that genetically-modified foods are potentially damaging to human health and the environment.

<p>The prime minister said the jury was still out on the new food technology and that there was cause for legitimate public concern. 

<p>Mr Blair argued that the potential benefits of GM technology were considerable, but insisted that his government was not an unquestioning supporter of GM food, and that its first priority would always be to provide the highest level of protection for the public.

<p>His comments appear to mark a significant shift in his attitude to GM technology.

<p>Only a year ago Mr Blair expressed his "frustration" at the outcry over genetic modification, and said he was sufficiently confident about the safety of GM foods to eat them himself.

<p>But in an article for the Independent on Sunday, Mr Blair writes: "There is no doubt that there is potential for harm, both in terms of human safety and in the diversity of our environment, from GM foods and crops.

<p>"It's why the protection of the public and the environment is, and will

remain, the government's over-riding priority."

<p>Mr Blair continues: "But there is no doubt, either, that this new

technology could bring benefits for mankind.

<p>"Some of the benefits from

biotechnology are already being seen in related areas such as the production of

life-saving medicines ...

<p>"GM crops, too, have the potential for good - helping feed the hungry by

increasing yields, enabling new strains of crops to be grown in hostile

conditions, or which are resistant to pests and disease."

<p><b>'Fantastic leap forward'</b>

<p>Mr Blair adds: "The key word here is potential, both in terms of harm and

benefit.

<p>"The potential for good highlights why we were right not to slam the

door on GM food or crops without further research.

<p>"The potential for harm shows

why we are right to proceed very cautiously indeed. And this is exactly what we

are doing."

<p>And he concludes: "I can promise that no GM food will be put on the market

here without going through the most rigorous safety assessments in the world ...

no GM crops will be grown commercially in this country until we are satisfied

there will be no unacceptable impact on the environment."

<p>Mr Blair's article was welcomed by Charles Secrett, executive director of

Friends of the Earth, who said: "This is a fantastic leap forward.

<p>"For the first time Mr Blair seems to be listening to the people on these

issues. The article signifies a real change of approach both over GM technology

and on environmental issues as a whole."
