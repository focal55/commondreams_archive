Rioblanco de Sotara, Colombia  --        The children and their 

teachers were in the schoolyard, they say, playing soccer and basketball and 

waiting for classes to begin when the crop-duster appeared. At first they 

waved, but as the plane drew closer and a gray mist began to stream from its 

wings, alarmed teachers rushed the pupils to their classrooms.

<P>  Over the next two weeks, a fleet of counternarcotics planes taking part 

in a U.S.-sponsored program to eradicate heroin poppy cultivation returned 

here repeatedly. Time and time again, residents charge, the government 

planes also sprayed buildings and fields that were not supposed to be 

targets, damaging residents' health and crops.	 

</P>

<P>  ``The pilot was flying low, so there is no way he could not have seen 

those children,'' said Nidia Majin, principal of the La Floresta rural 

elementary school, whose 70 pupils were sprayed that Monday morning last 

June. ``We had no way to give them first aid, so I sent them home. But they 

had to cross fields and streams that had also been contaminated, so some of 

them got sick.''	 

</P>

<P>  In fact, say leaders of this Yanacona Indian village high in the Andes, 

dozens of other residents also became ill during the spraying campaign, 

complaining of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, rashes, blurred vision and ear 

and stomachaches. They say the spraying damaged legitimate crops, 

undermining government efforts to support residents who have abandoned poppy 

growing.	 

</P>

<P>  Such incidents are not limited to this village of 5,000, say critics, but 

have occurred in many parts of Colombia and are bound to increase if the 

fumigation program is intensified, as the Clinton administration is 

proposing as part of a $1.6 billion emergency aid package.	 

</P>

<P>  Critics say they frequently receive reports of mistakes and abuses by the 

planes' Colombian pilots that both the U.S. and Colombian governments choose 

to ignore. State Department officials deny indiscriminate spraying takes 

place, with a U.S. Embassy official in Bogota describing the residents' 

claims of illnesses as ``scientifically impossible.''	 

</P>

<P>  But to local leaders, the situation brought on by the spraying remains a 

crisis. ``The fumigation was done in an indiscriminate and irresponsible 

manner, and it did not achieve its objective,'' said Ivan Alberto 

Chicangana, who was the mayor when the spraying occurred.	 

</P>

<P>  ``The damage done to the physical and economic well-being of this 

community has been serious,'' he said, ``and is going to be very difficult 

for us to overcome.''	 

</P>

<P>  He and other local leaders say that people were sick for several weeks 

after the spraying, and in interviews a few residents complained of lasting 

symptoms. Three fish farms with more than 25,000 rainbow trout were 

destroyed, residents said, and numerous farm animals, mostly chickens and 

guinea pigs, died, while others, including some cows and horses, fell ill.	 

</P>

<P>  In addition, fields of beans, onions, garlic, potatoes, corn and other 

traditional crops were sprayed, leaving plants to wither and die. As a 

result, community leaders here say, crop-substitution projects sponsored by 

the Colombian government have been irremediably damaged and their 

participants left impoverished.	 

</P>

<P>  Peasants in the coca-growing region of Caqueta, to the southeast, last 

year complained to a reporter that spray planes had devastated the crops 

they had planted after abandoning coca, and similar reports have emerged 

from Guaviare, another province to the east.	 

</P>

<P>  U.S.-financed aerial spraying campaigns have been the principal means by 

which the Colombian government has sought to reduce coca and opium-poppy 

cultivation for nearly a decade. The government fleet has grown to include 

65 airplanes and helicopters, which fly every day, weather permitting, from 

three bases. Last year, the spraying effort resulted in the fumigation of 

104,000 acres of coca and 20,000 acres of opium poppy.	 

</P>

<P>  Yet despite such efforts, which have been backed by more than $150 

million in U.S. aid, cocaine and heroin production in Colombia has more than 

doubled since 1995.	 

</P>

<P>  In an effort to reverse that trend and weaken left-wing guerrilla and 

right-wing paramilitary groups that are profiting from the drug trade and 

threatening the country's stability, the Clinton administration is now 

urging Congress to approve a new aid package, which calls for increased 

spending on drug eradication as well as a gigantic increase for 

crop-substitution programs, to $127 million from $5 million.	 

</P>

<P>  Critics, like Elsa Nivia, director of the Colombian affiliate of the 

advocacy organization Pesticide Action Network, see the eradication effort 

as dangerous and misguided. ``These pilots don't care if they are fumigating 

over schools, houses, grazing areas or sources of water,'' she said in an 

interview at the group's headquarters in Cali. ``Furthermore, spraying only 

exacerbates the drug problem by destabilizing communities that are trying to 

get out of illicit crops and grow legal alternatives.''	 

The U.S. Embassy official who supervises the spraying program said in an 

interview in Bogota that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the pesticide 

used here, is ``less toxic than table salt or aspirin.'' Calling it ``the 

most studied herbicide in the world,'' he said it was proven to be harmless 

to human and animal life and called the villagers' account ``scientifically 

impossible.''	 

</P>

<P>  But in an out-of-court settlement in New York state in 1996, Monsanto, a 

leading manufacturer of glyphosate-based herbicides, though not necessarily 

identical to those used here, including one called Roundup, agreed to 

withdraw claims that the product is ``safe, nontoxic, harmless or free from 

risk.'' The company signed a statement agreeing that its ``absolute claims 

that Roundup `will not wash or leach in the soil' is not accurate'' because 

glyphosate ``may move through some types of soil under some conditions after 

application.''	 

</P>

<P>  In the United States, the EPA has approved glyphosate for most commercial 

uses.
