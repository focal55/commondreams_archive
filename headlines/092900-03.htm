<p>&nbsp;BOGOTA, Colombia  - Marxist rebels issued a

warning on Friday to U.S. soldiers based in Colombia, saying

they will be declared a ``military target'' if they take any

front-line combat role in the nation's long-running war.

<p>``The FARC declares United States soldiers a military

target,'' said the headline of a statement distributed via the

Internet by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

</font>The 17,000-strong rebel army, known by its Spanish-language

acronym, is Latin America's largest and oldest guerrilla force

and has a dominant presence in roughly 40 percent of Colombia.

<p>``All Colombian or foreign military personnel in combat

zones will be a military target of the FARC,'' said the

statement, quoting senior rebel commander Andres Paris.

<p>``At the moment FARC guerrillas do not wish to reveal if

there are concrete plans to attack United States military bases

in the country,'' it said.

<p>But it added that several such bases, where U.S. military

personnel are located, were ``very close to regions where

guerrillas recently staged intense combat that caused

government forces important casualties.''

<p>U.S. and Colombian officials have said repeatedly that

American troops will not be involved directly in the Andean

nation's escalating war against the drug trade and the leftist

guerrillas they accuse of protecting and profiting from the

trafficking.

<p>Under a $1.3 billion U.S. aid package for Colombia approved

by the U.S. Congress in July, lawmakers opened the way for the

number of American advisers in Colombia to be doubled to about

500 at any one time, to train special battalions in fighting

drugs, and indirectly, guerrillas.

<p>But the package contains a clause that would allow the U.S.

president to wave the cap for 90 days in the event of an

''imminent involvement'' of U.S. forces in hostilities.

<p>The FARC has branded the aid package, consisting of mostly

military aid, as counterinsurgency assistance thinly disguised

as anti-drug aid, and warned repeatedly of Washington's slide

into a military quagmire.

<p>The latest FARC statement was similar to several others the

group has issued over the past year, warning U.S. military

advisers against a deeper, Vietnam-style involvement in an

internal conflict that has taken 35,000 lives over the past

decade.

<p>America's involvement in Vietnam began with the dispatch of

military advisers and led to the deaths of about 58,000 U.S.

troops.
