<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) has endorsed Vice President

      Al Gore in his bid for the White House, he doesn't hide his enthusiasm

      about the issues raised by Ralph Nader's presidential candidacy.



      

<P>Wellstone told The Hill that he agrees with Nader on almost

      every issue but one.</P>

<P>&quot;The only disagreement is that I'm not supporting a third

      party effort,&quot; he laughed. &quot;I'm just not in the Green

      Party.&quot;</P>

<P>The second-term Minnesota senator explained matter-of-factly

      that his endorsement for president was not a difficult decision.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm supporting the vice president in this race,&quot;

      Wellstone said in the form of a disclaimer. &quot;I've always

      said that I'm a Democrat, and that's who I support.&quot;</P>

<P>Yet, Gore was not Wellstone's first choice. The liberal themes

      of former Sen. Bill Bradley's (D-N.J) campaign mixed nicely with

      the issues Wellstone is most passionate about.</P>

<P>&quot;I thought that Bill's focus on the poverty of children

      was heart and soul,&quot; he said. &quot;I would have supported

      him on that alone.&quot;</P>

<P>But, the crash and burn of the Bradley campaign left the Democrats

      with only one contender. And the vice president was quick to

      court members of Congress who had supported Bradley, and, in

      turn, Wellstone was quick to endorse Gore.</P>

<P>&quot;About two days after Bradley bowed out, the vice president

      came to Minnesota,&quot; Wellstone recalled.</P>

<P>Yet, on many fronts, Nader's campaign follows the liberal

      line of Bradley's much closer to Wellstone's political philosophy

      than Gore's middle-of-the-road stances. Wellstone naturally gravitates

      to the same issues.</P>

<P>&quot;I think Ralph and I are in agreement on the key issues

      in the country - reform to health care, to the education system,

      to the right to organize,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>Labor is one area through which Wellstone and Nader continue

      to walk together, while Gore and the Democratic Party have wandered

      in search of, perhaps, more lucrative pastures.</P>

<P>&quot;The Democrats have institutionalized their indifference

      to organized labor,&quot; Nader recently said. &quot;Instead

      they're taking them for granted, and knowing it! Knowing it.&quot;</P>

<P>Specifically, the Minnesota senator and legendary consumer

      advocate are in agreement in their opposition to granting permanent

      normal trade relations (PNTR) to China. Both are adamant about

      taking human rights issues and the right to organize labor unions

      into account before the thoughts of business deals and economic

      interests.</P>

<P>Yet, while Wellstone shares many of the same ideas with Nader,

      he is careful to not use the words &quot;support&quot; or &quot;endorse&quot;

      when speaking of the man.</P>

<P>&quot;Ralph Nader is someone who I've always admired, and

      I continue to,&quot; Wellstone said. &quot;He continues to command

      my respect. There are a lot of issues that he's talking about

      that are important for the country.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The inequalities in the country - [Nader is] never afraid

      to take on the special interests,&quot; he continued, but was

      quick to promote the Democrat: &quot;The vice president is saying

      some of that stuff, as well.&quot;</P>

<P>Wellstone said that he and Nader are friends, but not in the

      personal sense.</P>

<P>&quot;We've known each other for a long time,&quot; he said.

      &quot;He's not someone who we get together with on the holidays.

      [But] he's a friend.&quot;</P>

<P>Many Democrats have kept their distance from Nader and the

      Green Party for fear of undermining the efforts of their own

      candidate. </P>

<P>However, Wellstone defended his stance on Nader, and didn't

      foresee troubles or criticism from others in the Democratic Party.</P>

<P>&quot;It's not based on any formal support,&quot; he said.
