WASHINGTON  - Even as more than 160 nations prepare to  

gather in 

The Hague to hammer out the final details of the international  

treaty to 

reduce 

heat-trapping greenhouse gases, the convention is facing a  

political quagmire 

which could prevent its successful implementation worldwide.

<P>

At issue are ''flexible market mechanisms'' such as emission  

permit trading 

and 

getting credit for planting trees, which absorb the greenhouse gas  

carbon 

dioxide. Most environmentalists view these proposals as loopholes  

that would 

enable countries to get credit for meeting most of their target  

reductions for 

actions that would have happened anyway. 

<P>

Unless countries resolve their differences and make a strong  

commitment to 

reduce their emissions in The Netherlands, Nov. 13-25, scientists  

say the 

consequences could be disastrous. Most climate experts believe  

that global 

warming is caused by mostly carbon-based gases emitted when fossil  

fuels, like 

oil, gas and coal are burned. 

<P>

Already these gases have been blamed for heating the deep oceans,  

fracturing 

Antarctic ice shelves and fuelling more intense El Ninos. Severe  

storms in 

Britain and France last week are the latest weather disruptions  

that are being 

viewed as an early taste of global warming. 

<P>

According to an upcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on  

Climate 

Change, which was leaked to the press, the international committee  

of climate 

experts is expected to say that it is likely that greenhouse gases  

have 

''contributed substantially to the observed warming over the last  

50 years''. 

<P>

To deal with the threats of climate change, industrialised nations -  

despite 

strong opposition from powerful oil, coal and gas industries  

fearing for their 

bottom-line - negotiated an international agreement in 1997, known  

as the 

Kyoto 

Protocol. Named after the Japanese city where it was drawn up, the  

treaty 

requires that industrialised countries reduce their emission by an  

average of 

five percent below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012. 

<P>

The Protocol requires the ratification of at least 55 of the  

countries that 

signed the Convention, including the industrialised countries of  

the 

Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  

which in 1990, 

accounted for more than half of carbon dioxide emissions, one of  

the main 

greenhouse gases. 

<P>

Yet the agreement has yet to be ratified by most of its  

signatories. Since its 

inception, the treaty has been plagued by political resistance  

from the United 

States, by far the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. 

<P>

While the administration of US President Bill Clinton signed the  

treaty, 

the US 

Senate refuses to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and has put language  

into 

appropriations bills that forbids the government from spending  

money to comply 

with the Kyoto Protocol. 

<P>

But most of the developing economies of Latin America, Asia and  

Africa argue 

that the wealthy industrialised nations should make the first move  

toward 

reducing emissions since they are responsible for the bulk of the  

emissions 

already in the atmosphere. 

<P>

The contentious issues left to be hammered out in The Hague  

revolve around the 

treaty's so-called market-based ''flexible mechanisms'' such as  

how emissions 

trading will work and whether there should be a limit to the  

extent this 

can be 

used to account for a country's Kyoto target. 

<P>

While the European Union believes there should be a limit to how  

much market 

mechanisms can be used, the US administration argues that it  

should be able to 

use flexible mechanisms to meet all of its reductions. 

<P>

Fourteen Latin American countries recently announced that they  

would back the 

US bid for emissions trading which would allow the United States  

to count the 

reduction of emissions in poorer countries and the use of carbon  

sinks - the 

planting or saving of forests - as part of its own quota under the  

Kyoto 

Protocol. 

<P>

Here in Washington this week, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the  

National 

Environmental Trust, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and  

the Union of 

Concerned Scientists (UCS) released a report saying that these  

mechanisms will 

amount to nothing but loopholes that will allow business to  

continue as usual. 

<P>

Environmentalists argue that international carbon trading - either  

between 

industrialised nations or between industrial and developing  

nations - cannot 

work since carbon is emitted from millions of sources all over the  

world and 

would be impossible to monitor. 

<P>

''Accounting gimmicks may fool bureaucrats, but they will not fool  

Mother 

Nature,'' says Alden Meyer, director of government relations at  

the UCS. ''The 

climate treaty must make real cuts of real pollution or the severe  

storms and 

other impacts that we are already starting to see will only get  

worse..' 

<P>

Further complicating the situation is the variation in emissions  

trends since 

the 1990 base year.  

<P>

Owing to economic collapse, Russia's 1995 emissions were 29  

percent below 1990 

levels, and Ukraine's 1997 emissions were down by 49 percent.  

Meanwhile, in 

1997 the European Union's emissions were only four percent below  

1990 

emissions 

while US emissions were 11 percent above 1990 levels. 

<P>

Because of these discrepancies, countries such as Russia and  

Ukraine under the 

Protocol have been granted carbon emission credits potentially  

worth billions 

of dollars annually. This then would allow the United States and  

other major 

emitters to meet most of their reduction commitment by purchasing  

credits from 

this region for reductions that have already taken place. 

<P>

''Trading of 'hot-air' would undermine the legitimacy of this  

(emission 

trading) system, making it more an arena for political horse- 

trading than a 

market mechanism,'' argues Hillary French, vice president of  

research at the 

Worldwatch Institute in Washington. 

<P>

In The Hague, countries will also debate how to harness the  

ability of forests 

to absorb 'greenhouse' gases. The United States, Japan, Canada and  

Australia 

are pushing for the inclusion of emission credits for tree  

plantations. 

<P>

But a report by Greenpeace and WWF released here this week says  

that rules to 

allow the use of forest plantations to store carbon pollution from  

the 

atmosphere could actually accelerate the destruction of old-growth  

or ancient 

native forests around the world. 

<P>

The environmental groups document how Tokyo Electric Power Company  

(TEPCO), 

Japan's largest power utility, has been implicated in the  

destruction of 

old-growth forest in the Australian state of Tasmania.  

<P>

According to the report, the company cut down native forest and  

replaced it 

with fast-growing eucalyptus plantations intended for 130,000 tons  

of credits 

that could be offset against rising carbon emissions in Japan. 

<P>

''We could see native forest destruction accelerate but still see  

no benefit 

for the global climate if Japan, Australia, Canada and the United  

States get 

their way,'' says Jennifer Morgan, director of WWF's climate  

change campaign. 

<P>

Environmentalists are also worried about that another of the  

flexible 

mechanisms under Kyoto called the Clean Development Mechanism  

(CDM) which will 

permit industrial nations to buy inexpensive reductions in  

developing 

countries. 

<P>

A typical CDM plan might involve selling China technology to make  

its coal 

cleaner, or a US coal-burning utility could pay to expand or  

preserve 

carbon-absorbing forests in Costa Rica. 

<P>

Ross Gelbspan, a long-time US-based author on climate change  

issues, says the 

CDM plan is inequitable since it would allow industrial nations to  

buy 

limitless amounts of cheap emission reductions in poor countries  

and to bank 

them indefinitely into the future. 

<P>

This would mean that when developing nations eventually become  

obligated to 

cut 

their own emissions, they will be left with only the most  

expensive options, 

says Gelbspan. 

<P>

''This clearly constitutes a form of environmental colonialism,''  

he says. 

<P>

In early October, more than 130 environmental organisations also  

criticised 

the 

US proposal for the CDM plan that would allow nuclear power plants  

to receive 

emission credits. 

<P>

Groups, including Public Citizen, Greenpeace and Friends of the  

Earth, say the 

US stance amounts to the transfer of a harmful outdated technology  

to Asia, 

Latin America and Africa. 

<P>

''Western nuclear companies, unable to get contracts at home due  

to safety, 

environmental and cost concerns, would be attempting to dump their  

unwanted 

and 

failing technology on developing countries,'' says a letter the  

organisations 

sent to Clinton.
