In a victory for multinational

corporations and other forces for economic globalisation, the US

Supreme Court Monday struck down a Massachusetts law that

penalised companies doing business in Burma.

<P>

The case, which took two years to reach the Court, has major

implications for grassroots human-rights and environmental

activism. 

<P>

It puts into question the future of such "selective purchasing"

laws used by state and local governments over 25 years to pressure

companies to withdraw from apartheid South Africa and, more

recently, from Cuba, Nigeria, and Switzerland, among other

countries. 

<P>

"It invalidates all state and local sanctions aimed at Burma and

sends an extremely strong message to states and local governments

that they should not be in the business of making foreign policy,"

said Greg Costanias, the lead attorney for the National Foreign

Trade Council (NFTC), an association of some 600 companies which

brought the lawsuit. 

<P>

Supporters of the Massachusetts law, on the other hand, insisted

that the Court's opinion did not go that far. "It's a yellow

light; not a red light (for selective-purchasing laws)," said

Robert Stumberg, a law professor at Georgetown University who

helped Massachusetts prepare its case.  

<P>

Other Burma campaigners said they will introduce new laws designed

to punish companies doing business in Burma in other ways in

coming months. 

<P>

The case, which was filed by the NFTC in 1998, is based on a law

approved by the Massachusetts legislature in 1996. It required

companies doing business in Burma to add 10 percent to all of its

bids for procurement contracts with the state.  

<P>

Such selective-purchasing laws are designed to force companies to

choose between continuing to do business with repressive

governments abroad and bidding on often-lucrative state or local

governments contracts.  

<P>

Such laws were used most successfully during the late 1970s and

1980s to force scores of US multinationals - including such giants

as Coca-Cola, IBM, and General Motors - to withdraw from South

Africa. According to most experts, the resulting divestment played

a major role in bringing about majority rule there. 

<P>

Some two dozen states and cities, including New York, Los Angeles,

Minneapolis, and San Francisco have enacted similar laws against

companies doing business in Burma, where a military junta has

repressed the democratic opposition led by Nobel Peace Laureate

Aung San Suu Kyi. As a result, some of the country's best-known

companies, including several from the retail apparel industry,

withdrew.  

<P>

Multinationals naturally oppose these initiatives because they

curb companies' freedom to do business where they please. Until

the NFTC lawsuit, however, they were reluctant to challenge these

laws in court due to the negative publicity that would result from

a company claiming a right to do business with abusive

governments. 

<P>

The NFTC was backed by the European Union (EU) and Japan whose

companies were also affected by the Massachusetts law. Claiming

that Massachusetts had violated a multilateral ban on sub-national

governments using non-economic criteria in deciding contract bids,

they also filed challenges to the law in the World Trade

Organisation (WTO) and amicus curiae briefs with the courts here

in support of the NFTC. 

<P>

The Clinton administration, which was deeply split on the issue,

stayed out of the case until last February when it submitted its

own brief arguing that the Massachusetts law had violated the US

constitution by "impermissibly infring(ing) upon the national

government's exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs." 

<P>

That position echoed the judgements of the district court in

Massachusetts and the appeals court both of which decided the case

on sweeping constitutional grounds that appeared to invalidate

acts by state and local governments designed to affect conditions

in foreign countries. 

<P>

For its part, Massachusetts, which was supported by amicus briefs

from more than two dozen states and cities and some 78 members of

Congress and dozens of state attorneys-general, argued that states

"should be free ... to apply a moral standard to their spending

decisions ... Nothing in the federal Constitution ... requires the

states to trade with dictators." 

<P>

Monday's 9-0 decision declined to explicitly endorse the more-

sweeping holdings by two lower courts.  

<P>

Instead, the Court ruled more narrowly that a Congressionally

enacted law directed at specific countries, such as Burma, pre-

empts any action taken by local governments vis-à-vis the same

countries. In Burma's case, it found, Congress had passed a law

that gave President Bill Clinton broad discretion to impose or

lift sanctions directed against the country. 

<P>

"Because the state Act's provisions conflict with Congress's

specific delegation to the President of flexible discretion (on

sanctions) ... and with direction to develop a comprehensive,

multilateral strategy under the federal Act, it is pre-empted, and

its application is unconstitutional," the Court said in a 10-page

opinion by Justice David Souter. 

<P>

By failing to rule explicitly on whether all selective-purchasing

laws - including those which target a country that is not the

subject of Congressional sanctions legislation - violate

constitutional provisions on the president's power, the Court

appeared to invite further debate. 

<P>

"Yes, it's a red light when Congress has specifically delegated

power to the president," said Stumberg, who added that where

Congress has not done so, selective-purchasing laws may still be

permitted. "This was not decided by a sweeping constitutional

theory that says states have no role in adopting standards of

public morality in determining purchasing," he said. 

<P>

But the NFTC's Costanias disagreed. "If there isn't a red light,

then it's an awfully pink one," he told IPS. Citing passages in

the opinion which referred to the president's foreign-policy-

making authority as an "exclusively national power," Costanias

added: "It's hard to read that language as allowing any role for

the states and local governments to conduct their own little

versions of foreign policy." 

<P>

Still, Burma activists said they were undaunted.  

<P>

They said they are currently mulling over several possible

responses: using state and local governments to require companies

bidding on public contracts to disclose where they do business;

using public pension funds and investment agencies more to press

shareholder resolutions requiring divestment or other similar

measures; and persuading local and state legislatures to petition

Congress to explicitly provide the legal authority for selective

purchasing laws, as was done in federal anti-apartheid

legislation. 

<P>

"Over the next six months, we plan to introduce new Free-Burma

laws in several key cities and states in New England," said Simon

Billenness, co-ordinator of the New England Burma Roundtable. "Our

message to corporations is clear: If you do business in Burma,

your business will suffer in New England."
