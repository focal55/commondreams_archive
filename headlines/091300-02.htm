WASHINGTON<wbr>--<wbr>A Justice Department study has found that black convicts in the

federal penal system face the death penalty much more often than white

prisoners, confirming the arguments of those who say that capital

punishment is not applied uniformly.

<p>The statistical survey, the first comprehensive study of the federal

death penalty since it was reinstated in 1988, found a wide racial

disparity in recommendations for capital punishment from federal

prosecutors across the country. Roughly three-fourths of federal

defendants recommended for capital punishment over the last five years

were minorities.

<p>President Clinton said that the figures raise concerns "since we're

supposed to have a uniform law of the land." But he added that there had

been "no suggestion, as far as I know, that any of the [federal] cases

where convictions occurred were wrongly decided."

<p>With the fairness of capital punishment figuring in the presidential

campaign, the findings promptly led to renewed calls from some members of

Congress, legal groups and human rights organizations for a federal

moratorium on executions.

<p>Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, however, rejected a moratorium on the federal

death penalty, saying that such a delay "goes to the issue of people who

were wrongfully charged," which the department's survey does not address.

<p>Instead, Reno called for additional research and said that

overrepresentation of minorities on federal death rows reflects racial

and economic disparities throughout the criminal justice system and

points to the connection between crime and higher rates of economic and

social problems in minority communities.

<p>More than anything, Reno said, the survey's findings may reflect that

"our system, our society, is not fair to a large number of minority

children . . . who do not have equal opportunities."

<p>While the figures "should be a concern to us all," she said, so long

as poverty, drug abuse and unequal opportunities continue to take an

especially heavy toll on black youths, "we will continue to see

disparities in the number of minorities in the criminal justice system."

The study found that, of 682 defendants charged with federal crimes

subject to the death penalty, 20% were white and 80% were minorities.

U.S. attorneys recommended that the death penalty be sought for 183 of

them--26% of them white and 74% minorities.

<p>Reno approved seeking death penalties for 159 of those 183

defendants--28% of whom were white and 72% minorities, the majority of

them black.

<p>Deputy Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., who supervised the study, said

that he was "personally and professionally disturbed by the [racial]

disparity," which showed that "minorities are overrepresented" on federal

death rows.

<p>The study also found geographic differences in application of the

federal death penalty. Just nine of the 94 U.S. attorney districts

accounted for 43% of all death penalty recommendations. They are Puerto

Rico, two in the New York region, western Missouri, western Tennessee,

northern Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Virginia and Maryland.

<p>Although state systems were not included in the Justice Department's

survey, Reno said that she believes the racial disparities "may be

roughly the same."

<b><br>

<p>Study Based on Recommendations

</b>

<p>During the latest five-year span, 20 defendants have received death

sentences from federal judges or juries. Only a fifth of them are white.

<p>But the Justice Department study focused on the recommendations of its

own officials in Washington and its top prosecutors in the field, not on

actual death sentences meted out in the federal system.

<p>In the federal system, capital punishment is reserved for such

offenses as terrorist bombings, violence in some drug crimes, violence at

international airports, assassination of government officials and violent

crimes in aid of racketeering activity.

<p>To achieve more uniformity, Reno established a new system in 1995.

U.S. attorneys now must submit cases to a review committee in Washington.

Reno herself then has to approve the death penalty when it is sought for

federal defendants. Neither the review team members nor Reno are told the

race of a defendant.

<p>The report noted that "overall, the federal government continues to

play a relatively small role in administering the death penalty in this

country." From 1930 to 1999, state governments executed 4,400 defendants,

mostly for murder convictions, which generally are state crimes. In the

same period, the federal government put to death only 33 defendants and

has not carried out any executions since 1963.

<b><br>

<p>Leaders Urge Delay of Executions

</b>

<p>The Supreme Court in 1972 struck down state death penalty laws on

grounds that they were being applied unfairly, a ruling that also brought

federal executions to a halt, even though there had been none during the

previous nine years. The court later reinstated the death penalty after

the adoption of new procedures.

<p>The federal government revised its procedures in 1988, when Congress

passed the Drug Kingpin Act, making the death penalty a possible

punishment for some drug-related offenses.

<p>Under the previous system, which was in effect from 1988 to 1994, 52

defendants were submitted by U.S. attorneys to their Justice Department

superiors for approval of death penalty recommendations. In that period,

racial disparities were similar to those of the last five years, the

study showed.

<p>About 13% of those defendants were white, 75% were black, and most of

the remainder were Latino.

<p>Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), a chief sponsor of bipartisan

legislation to guarantee DNA tests to certain federal inmates, called the

Justice Department study "more clear evidence that the death penalty

system is broken" and that "this is a national problem."

<p>Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) renewed his demand and that of five

other members of Congress that Clinton postpone any federal executions

until a commission can study the issue.

<p>Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) called for a moratorium similar to

the one imposed in Illinois last January by Republican Gov. George Ryan.

"We should not have business as usual," Jackson said.

<p>William F. Schulz, executive director of the human rights group

Amnesty International, said that "no one should be surprised that the

federal death penalty is displaying the same lottery-like qualities that

plague capital justice at a state level." He also urged a national

moratorium on executions.
