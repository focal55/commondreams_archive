<p>BOSTON - Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader has booked the FleetCenter for a political rally to be held two days before the scheduled presidential debate at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.

<P>

<P>The focus of the rally will be the ''closed-door'' nature of the debate, according to Green Party officials. The Oct. 3 debate  at UMass includes only Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democratic candidate Al Gore.

<P>

<P>Nader should be allowed to participate in the televised face-off, said Green Party organizer Annette Ramos, who expects about 13,000 people to attend the rally.

<P>

<P>The Commission on Presidential Debates has said that only candidates with the support of at least 15 percent of the electorate in polls would be allowed to debate.

<P>

<P>Nader and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan have both registered in the single digits in national polls and would probably be barred from the debates.

<P>

<P>Nader had filed a federal lawsuit claiming that corporate sponsorship of presidential debates is illegal because it amounts to corporate contributions to political campaigns, which are illegal.

<P>

<P>AT&T, Anheuser-Busch, and Sun Microsystems are among companies making tax-deductible contributions to the nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates.

<P>

<P>US District Court Judge Patti Saris ruled that the debates are nonpartisan and encourage people to vote, and thus meet an exception to rules prohibiting such contributions in federal elections.
