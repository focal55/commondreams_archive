WASHINGTON  - In light of a proposed merger of two

multinational

oil companies announced this week, consumer and environmental

groups  are

warning that the growing concentration of power and wealth of the

oil  industry

is unsafe for the environment, communities, and consumers

worldwide. 

<P>

On Oct. 15, California-based Chevron Corporation agreed to acquire

Texaco Inc.

for about 36 billion dollars in stock, creating the world's fourth-largest oil

company. The acquisition comes at a time when crude oil prices

have hit their

highest in a decade, while oil company profits have skyrocketed. 

<P>

Both companies are expected to be forced to sell off some of their

as sets in

order to win approval by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Regardless of the

long road before the acquisition is approved, the merger will

likely  go ahead

relatively smoothly since the green-light has already been given

recently to

several even larger oil mergers. 

<P>

In April, British Petroleum (BP) Amoco and ARCO (Atlantic

Richfield C ompany)

received clearance from the US FTC for the combination of their

companies.

The union will create a corporate group worth some 200 billion

dollars.  

<P>

And in late 1999, the regulatory agency approved the 82 billion

dollar merger

of Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation. 

<P>

Consumer and environmental groups alike are concerned that the

recent  spate of

mergers will lead to an unhealthy concentration of power. They say

the mergers

are unmaking history by putting back some of the pieces of the

Standard Oil

empire that was broken up into 34 companies by the US Supreme

Court i n 1911. 

<P>

Exxon was originally Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was

once  Standard

Oil of New York. Atlantic Refining was one of the Standard Oil

companies

and in

1965 was later named ARCO. Standard Oil of California was renamed

Chevron,

while Standard Oil of Indiana was renamed Amoco. Standard Oil of

Ohio  was

bought out in 1987 by British Petroleum. 

<P>

Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy

Project says

that this trend toward more consolidation is bad for consumers in

the  long run

and has the added impact of increasing the political power of

these larger

companies to influence environmental and energy policy. 

<P>

Most of these recently merged oil companies have been involved in

campaigns

against an international agreement on climate change, known as the

Kyoto

Protocol. The treaty requires industrialised countries to reduce

their

heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, caused by the burning of

coal, oil,

and

petrol. 

<P>

The influence of the oil companies on US lawmakers, through

campaign

contributions and lobbying, has already thwarted ratification of

the  Protocol.

As they merge, their views become even more commanding. 

<P>

Rather than moving away from the use of oil, these larger, more

politically

powerful companies, says Hauter, ''can influence public policy and

th is

results

in more subsidies, more tax breaks for the oil industry and

increased  pressure

to drill in environmentally sensitive areas''. 

<P>

James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, an

advocacy group

based in Washington, says that worldwide consolidation of the oil

industry

makes it easier for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting

Countries

(OPEC) to

keep prices high. 

<P>

''OPEC benefits from increased oil company concentration, which

makes  it much

easier to monitor private actions and even to solicit co-operation

fr om the

leading private actors,'' he told reporters. 

<P>

Some politicians have also voiced concern about the mergers. Upon

announcement

of the Chevron-Texaco merger, Chris Lehane, a spokesman for

Democratic

presidential candidate Al Gore told reporters: ''Given the fact

that  oil

companies saw their profits rise by more than 300 percent in the

past  year, it

raises the question whether big oil is getting too big.'' 

<P>

Despite Vice President Gore's family connection to Occidental

Petroleum, the

Presidential candidate has donned a populist hat. He said various

times while

on the campaign trail that ''big oil'' was getting too powerful.  

<P>

Environmental groups are campaigning against California-based

Occidental to

stop drilling for oil on land claimed by an indigenous tribe in

Colombia. 

<P>

Environmentalists say that the Chevron-Texaco merger unites two

''corporate

criminals'' which have troubled records on the environment and

human  rights.

Both companies are currently being sued in US court for their

operations

abroad

which allegedly have led to environmental and human rights

violations. 

<P>

''These facts are rarely considered by the regulators when looking

at  mergers

and acquisitions, but they should be,'' says Danny Kennedy,

executive  director

of Project Underground, a California-based environmental watchdog. 

<P>

Chevron is facing a lawsuit in Federal Court for its alleged role

in

providing the Nigerian military with equipment that was used to

attack

people protesting the oil companies in 1998. The company is also

accused

of aiding the military in an attack on the villages of Opia and

Ikenyan

in the Niger Delta region. 

<P>

New York-based Texaco is facing a billion-dollar class action

lawsuit  filed by

people in Ecuador, including several indigenous tribes, charging

the  company

deliberately polluted the environment. 

<P>

According to Judith Kimerling, a lawyer who first documented the

impact of oil

development on the Ecuadorian Amazon in the 1991 book 'Amazon

Crude',  Texaco

discharged an estimated 4.3 million gallons of highly toxic

''produced'' water

per day into the rain forest, as it pumped billions of gallons of

crude out of

Ecuador. 

<P>

The plaintiffs claim that the company - which denies all charges -  

ignored oil 

industry standards and instead of re-injecting the waste into the  

ground, 

Texaco dumped its toxic cocktail of chemicals into unlined pits  

that 

eventually 

leached into streams and rivers. 

<P>

Paulina Garzon with the Center for Economic and Social Rights in  

Quito, 

Ecuador 

has worked with indigenous communities in documenting the impact  

of pollution 

allegedly caused by Texaco's past operations. 

<P>

''Now, we find that the first thing (oil) companies say when they  

come to 

Ecuador is that they are not like Texaco,'' says Garzon.
