<p>With millions of ordinary people

killed in conflicts during the last decade, the United Nations

is devoting International Women's Day on Wednesday to the

personal loss and devastation caused by war.

<p>Entitled ``Women Uniting for Peace,'' a U.N.-style town

meeting includes professors advocating women intervene in

peacekeeping to children organizing against war to films of

widows on both sides of the Vietnam conflict.

<p>``To this day, the strategies that have been applied to

peace negotiations have at least one thing in common: they have

almost entirely ignored women's visions for peace and social

chance,'' said General Assembly President Theo-Ben Gurirab,

Namibia's foreign minister.

<p>``Women are half of every community. Are they therefore not

also half of every solution?'' Gurirab said in a statement

written for the occasion.

<p>Countless civilians have died in civil conflicts since the

end of the Cold War a decade ago in such places as Sierra Leone,

Angola, Liberia, Sudan, Kosovo, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Bosnia,

Colombia and Afghanistan.

<p>The wars have killed 2 million children, left 6 million

maimed, created 1 million orphans and 12 million refugees and

uprooted 30 million people from their homes, the U.N. says.

<p>Women in Black, a loose organization, that began in Albania

and held vigils in Belgrade, plan to stand silently in the

United Nations courtyard to mourn for war victims.
