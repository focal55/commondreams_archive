<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.<wbr>--<wbr>Time warp?

<p>Listen in on the rhetoric buzzing through Missouri's capital these

days, and you might begin to think so.

<p>Here's a state senator earnestly proclaiming that we must add the

Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution "if this country is to be

great and stand tall."

<p>There's Phyllis Schlafly, the ERA's arch-foe, warning that the

amendment would legalize same-sex marriages and promote "abortion on

demand."

<p>Here's praise for righteous symbolism. There's scorn of constitutional

clutter. Coed bathrooms. Women in combat. Wasn't this all settled two

decades ago?

<p>Well, yes.

<p>But then again, maybe not.

<p>Most activists--most everyone, really--thought the ERA died in 1983.

It had been ratified by 35 states but needed 38 to make it into the

Constitution. The original ratification deadline had come and gone. So

had a three-year extension. And Congress was not inclined to give ERA

backers any more time. Even the Supreme Court pronounced the amendment

dead.

<p>Now, a few stubborn dreamers are attempting to revive it.

<p>They consider the original 35 ratifications still valid. By that

logic, all the ERA needs to win a spot in the Constitution is approval

from three more states. Focusing on Missouri--but targeting Illinois and

Virginia as well--ERA activists are pushing hard to get those three

additional ratifications.

<p>They take courage from precedent: In 1992, Congress revived an

amendment that had languished for more than 200 years by ordering that

the ratification tally pick up where it had stalled back in George

Washington's day. In other words, Congress decided that states' 18th

century votes still counted. New states then jumped to ratify. And the

amendment--which requires a roll-call vote before Congress can grant

itself a pay raise--is now part of the Constitution.

<p>That episode gave ERA activists hope.

<p>After all, they reasoned, if an amendment can be resurrected after two

centuries, why not after two decades?

<p>"It takes a long time to win the big ones, and this is a big one,"

said Roberta Francis, who leads a national effort to ratify the ERA. She

then quoted women's suffrage champion Susan B. Anthony: "Failure is not

an option."

<p>It is, however, a distinct possibility.

<p>For the three-state strategy has several potential flaws.

<p>For one, Congress set a time limit--long since expired--on ERA

ratification. (The pay raise amendment had no such deadline.) Congress

could, presumably, pass new legislation reopening the ERA for debate. But

then it might be hard to make the case that the original 35 ratifications

should count.

<p>Another hitch: Five states that ratified the ERA in the '70s later

passed resolutions taking it back. ERA boosters insist it's illegal for a

state to cancel its ratification. But that position, again, would be open

to legal challenge.

<p>Then there's the issue of public support.

<p>In the 1970s, the ERA stirred strong passions. However, it has since

dropped out of view.

<p>Kelly Anthony, a Missouri college senior trying to rev up student

support for the ERA, acknowledges that "even some of my feminist friends

don't know what it is." And while Francis says she's sure most Americans

are behind her, she couches her conviction this way: "They absolutely

would care--as soon as they knew about it."

<p>One group in the know is the Missouri Legislature, where ERA sponsors

in both the House and the Senate are confident they can bring

ratification to a vote this spring. The ERA has some powerful backers in

both chambers. But it also has detractors who see the whole debate as a

dispiriting waste of time.

<p>"Maybe I'm from a different generation, but I feel that women have all

the opportunities in the world," said state Rep. Vicky Hartzler, 39, a

Republican. "Instead of sending women the message that we need to support

[the ERA] because we're still victims, we should be telling them that the

past is behind us, we have a bright future and it's time to move forward

with confidence."

<p>ERA advocates counter that women can't stride ahead with confidence

until their rights are guaranteed.

<p>Sure, there are federal laws granting women equal access to education

or equal pay for equal work. But those are laws, not constitutional

guarantees. A future Congress could repeal them. Or gut the funding that

supports them.

<p>"Only by including [women's equality] in the Constitution can we grind

it into the bedrock of our national policy," said Missouri House Speaker

Steve Gaw, a Democrat.

<p>Beyond that symbolism, however, even the ERA's most ardent backers

find it tough to articulate just what the amendment would accomplish.

<p>"It isn't concrete, not something you can see will immediately help me

in my lifetime," said Mary Mosley, who heads Missouri's ERA lobby. "It's

more the principle of the thing."
