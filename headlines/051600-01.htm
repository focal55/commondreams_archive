WASHINGTON - The US Agency for International

Development (AID) is cutting funding for Indonesian environmental

groups because of their criticism of US mining corporations,

according to environmentalists here and in Indonesia.

<P>

So far, the funding of one Indonesia environmental non-

governmental

organisation (NGO) has been cut by the US government agency and

groups here and in Indonesia worry that financial support for

another - which it supported for years - will also be stopped.  

<P>

Environmental groups warn that de-funding Indonesian NGOs

undermines recent attempts to amend the corruption of the past

regime under former President Suharto.  

<P>

Since the democratic election of President Abdurrahman Wahid, many

groups and government officials are now openly criticising

contracts signed under the past dictatorship with multinational

corporations, including US mining companies. 

<P>

''We strongly urge the US State Department to support Indonesia's

fragile democracy rather than protect sweetheart deals for

American

corporations,'' says a letter by Friends of the Earth sent to

Secretary of State Madeline Albright.  

<P>

In April, the Indonesian Mining Advocacy Network, a Jakarta-based

advocacy group known as JATAM, received a letter from the Bio-

diversity Support Programme Kemala, which disburses US AID funds,

that said it would not renew the network's funding.  

<P>

The group had been given 75,000 dollars to protect the rights of

communities to manage their natural resources and also assist in

monitoring the impact of mining operations. 

<P>

Citing human rights abuses and environmental destruction caused by

mining in Indonesia, JATAM came out with a strong position in 1999

to cease all new mining activities in Indonesia and urged the

government to revoke all the mining licenses and permits given to

all mining corporations.  

<P>

One of the main perpetrators, according to JATAM, is Denver-based

Newmont Mining Corporation.  

<P>

Last week, Chalid Muhammed, director of JATAM, went to the

company's annual meeting in Denver, Colorado and told shareholders

that Newmont is dumping thousands of tons of toxic mine tailing

waste directly into rivers and coastal waters from its Minahasa

Raya gold mine located in North Sulawesi.  

<P>

While Newmont says it has high environmental standards and has

never broken the law, Muhammed told IPS that high concentrations

of mercury, lead, arsenic, copper, cadmium and other toxic

compounds have been measured in nearby Buyat Bay.  

<P>

''Fish stocks have declined dramatically and this is a big problem

for the fishermen whose income is going down,'' he says.  

<P>

After JATAM held a workshop in November 1999 condemning Newmont's

actions, Muhammed says he received a call from the US Embassy

inquiring whether the funds used in the workshop were derived from

US AID. According to Muhammed, the Embassy said they received a

complaint from Newmont protesting the use of US taxpayers' money

to fund a campaign against a US company. 

<P>

Kim Walz, a spokeswoman for US AID, confirmed that JATAM's funding

was not renewed.  

<P>

''Doubts were raised about JATAM's ability to give impartial

assistance to communities and we determined that this was harmful

to US goals,'' she told IPS.  

<P>

In the face of the funding cut, members of the organisation say

they remain determined to not alter their position in order to

receive financial support 

<P>

''We shall continue our work to support communities and the

environment against the ravages of the oil and mining industry and

will not bow to pressure,'' says Estee Helvi Lystiani, the

information manager at JATAM. 

<P>

Another Indonesia environmental group's funding may also be on the

chopping block because of its criticism of mining operations in

Irian Jaya, the name given to the western half of New Guinea,

according to Friends of the Earth here. 

<P>

Known as Walhi, or Friends of the Earth Indonesia, the

environmental group says Freeport McMoRan's Grasberg Mine in Irian

Jaya, has devastated more than 100 kilometres of rainforest. They

accuse Freeport of dumping toxic mine waste into nearby rivers

causing fish caught by the Amungme tribe to die.  

<P>

With copper, gold, and silver deposits reportedly worth more than

60 billion dollars, Grasberg is one of the world's largest mines

and remains the country's single largest source of tax revenue.  

<P>

Indonesia's environmental groups are hardly the only critics of

Grasberg.  

<P>

The mine's impact sparked an international outcry and prompted the

US Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) which was

helping finance the mine, to conduct an independent environmental

audit of Grasberg.  

<P>

According to OPIC, the mine ''has created and continues to pose

unreasonable or major environmental, health or safety hazards with

respect to the rivers that are being impacted by the tailings, the

surrounding ecosystems, and the local inhabitants.'' 

<P>

Like Walhi, the Indonesian Minister of Environment and several

Indonesian parliamentarians are calling for an independent

environmental audit of Freeport's operations. Some officials have

raised the possibility of renegotiating the corporation's Contract

of Work with the government. 

<P>

In the past several weeks, according to Friends of the Earth, US

Ambassador to Indonesia Robert Gelbard has publically praised

Freeport's environmental record and personally intervened to cut

off funds for JATAM and Walhi. The latter has received about

400,000 dollars since 1997 from US AID. 

<P>

Walz, with US AID, says this is untrue. 

<P>

''There has been no pressure whatsoever,'' she told IPS. ''The

Ambassador has not discussed this with US AID.'' 

<P>

She says that she can neither confirm nor deny that Walhi's

funding will be cut. ''Walhi is up for routine renewal and they

are currently in negotiations,'' she says.  

<P>

An environmental letter writing campaign here urging the US State

Department to continue funding Walhi has reportedly yielded more

than 6,000 letters, according to Friends of the Earth.  

<P>

''The Indonesian people are making valiant and courageous efforts

to establish a clean, effective and responsive government, to

enforce the rule of law, to create a just society and to safeguard

Indonesia's unique natural heritage,'' says the letter.
