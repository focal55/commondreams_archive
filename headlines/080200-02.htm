LOS POZOS, Colombia<wbr> - <wbr>Using U.S.-donated helicopters to reinforce Colombian police during

guerrilla attacks will escalate this country's prolonged civil conflict

and draw America closer to direct involvement in the fighting, a rebel

spokesman warned Tuesday.

<p>Raul Reyes, spokesman for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,

or FARC, this country's oldest and largest guerrilla force, said

helicopters used to rescue police during attacks will be considered

"military targets," subject to being shot down.

<p>He made the remarks in this rebel-controlled hamlet a day after State

Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said in Washington that the Clinton

administration will not "second-guess" the way Colombian police decide to

use Black Hawk helicopters donated by the United States for the fight

against illegal drugs.

<p>Reeker's statement added fuel to the debate over the U.S. role in

Colombia, a country where a 36-year conflict has been exacerbated in the

past decade by drug money that has left both the rebels and the

right-wing private armies that pursue them better armed than the

military.

<p>The helicopters, piloted by Colombian police, have generally been used

to protect planes that fumigate crops of opium poppies and coca, the raw

material used to make cocaine. Colombia supplies about three-fourths of

the world's cocaine and an increasing share of the heroin sold in the

United States.

<p>After recent guerrilla attacks on police outposts, U.S. congressional

members who support the Colombian police have criticized the Clinton

administration for allegedly preventing use of the helicopters for

reinforcement or rescue operations. When police officers were killed late

last month in a remote area after guerrillas pinned them down and they

ran out of ammunition, the U.S. Embassy released a statement denying that

the ambassador had prohibited the Colombians from sending the helicopters

in for support.

<p>Weather conditions were blamed for grounding the aircraft both then

and over the weekend, when a guerrilla incursion left the northern town

of Arboleda in ruins. Only four of more than two dozen police assigned to

the town are known to have survived the attack, which was carried out

with weapons that included gas cylinders hurled like Molotov cocktails.

<p>On Monday, Reeker said the Black Hawks could be used in such

situations.

<p>"What they are trying to do is intimidate us," said Reyes, the rebel

spokesman. "But all that intimidation and threats will achieve is a more

forceful reply of the Colombians in defense of our national sovereignty.

<p>"This is direct intervention of the United States in the internal

affairs of Colombia," he said.

<p>The helicopters used by police have been donated over the past two

years and are not part of the $1.3-billion anti-narcotics aid package

approved by the U.S. Congress in late June. Reyes called the package "an

attack against the Colombian peace process," whose negotiations are now

entering their 18th month.

<p>Only two of the helicopters to be supplied as part of the new aid

bundle are destined for the police. The rest will go to the army to

support recently formed anti-narcotics battalions.

<p>Both the $289 million in anti-narcotics aid given to Colombia last

year and the new package are restricted to being used in the fight

against drug production and trafficking. However, the line between the

drug war and the guerrilla war in Colombia is often blurred because

rebels collect "taxes" on drug crops grown in areas under their control.

<p>Further, U.S. congressional supporters of the Colombian police have

long urged crossing that line.

<p>The most vocal of those, Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), said during

a conference in Washington last year, "The administration has been so

preoccupied with avoiding being involved in Colombia's counterinsurgency

efforts that it has permitted the situation to erode and deteriorate."

<p>However, Reyes disputed the notion that the United States has been

extra-careful about avoiding counter-guerrilla activities.

<p>"Ever since the Black Hawks arrived, they have been used against us,"

he said. "What [the U.S. is] doing now is publicly recognizing that they

can be used."

<p>Both civilian pilots flying fumigation planes under contract and

helicopter pilots protecting them have reported being fired on by rebels

over the past two years. Guerrillas have said that they fired on the

aircraft to protect civilians from fumigation chemicals.
