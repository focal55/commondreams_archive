THE number of executions in America is so high that states are advertising for volunteers to act as public witnesses to the killings.

<p>



 Both Arizona and Pennsylvania have asked the curious to apply and are offering days out on Death Row to see how one of the "most traditional forms of justice" is meted out. A total of 38 states have the death penalty and the majority require public witnesses. Most say that there should be at least half a dozen people present with no connection to the crime or to the media.

<p>



 The Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. There were only 11 executions between then and 1984 but last year there were 98. In Arizona, where 11 inmates were scheduled for execution last year, the prison service scoured the state for witnesses, putting advertisements in the local press and publishing letters on its website.

<p>



 The publicity drive proved successful and the state now has almost 100 volunteers. In other states, too, officials keep a list of people interested in attending executions but the pool of volunteers is running dry. All applicants are required to submit a letter detailing their reasons for wanting to attend. Only a few are turned down.<p>



 "We get all sorts of people," a spokesman for the Texas Corrections department, which has one of the highest numbers of executions, said. "They range from students who are doing a thesis on the death penalty to people in the film industry who are featuring an execution in their film and want to see a real one. We also get people who say they will win a bet if they can sit through it without fainting."

<p>



 Anti-execution campaigners say the drive to get more people to be witnesses should help their cause. "Once you have seen what happens to someone who is electrocuted, or dies from lethal injection, you will never forget it and you will see how barbaric the situation is," a spokesman for the Human Rights Commission to end the Death Penalty said.
