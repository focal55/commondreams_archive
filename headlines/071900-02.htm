BLUE RIDGE SUMMIT, Pa. - In a crisis that threatened national security, senior civilian and military officials would relocate from Washington to "Site R," a nuclear-war-fighting command center built deep inside a solid-rock mountain near this bucolic town.

<P>

    So secret it doesn't have a proper name, the underground command and communications center is part of an extensive, painstaking and costly government effort to secure a cherished American political principle:

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>Elected civilian leaders are in charge - not the military, especially in wartime.

<P>

    But that principle would be overturned by the proposed national missile-defense system, which would have to react so quickly to the threat of incoming warheads that its military operators would make the decision to fire.

<P>

    Warheads could detonate on American soil within minutes. And so it would be a snap decision under enormous pressure.

<P>

    Thus the decision to go to war, the most grave choice a democracy can face, would be removed from the president in the Oval Office and given instead to an unknown military officer sequestered in an underground command post - or, to a computer.





<P>

<B>A fundamental issue</B>

<P>

<P>

    The proposed missile-defense system - to detect, track and shoot down enemy missiles as they streak through space - has failed two out of three of its tests, the latest on July 7. The decision about whether the United States should build it remains pending.

<P>

    Although a missile defense against "rogue states" has been endorsed by both major presidential candidates, it has generated bitter disputes over its potential effectiveness and its ramifications for global stability.

<P>

    But no one has raised the more fundamental issue of who would be in charge.

<P>

    The White House, asked for comment, was initially flummoxed. After several days, Army Lt. Col. David Stockwell, spokesman for the National Security Council, said the president "would be involved" in the command and control of a national missile-defense system.

<P>

    But Stockwell declined to say that the president would take part in a decision to actually fire interceptor missiles. "It's all under development at this time, and to say anything more would be speculation," he said.







<P>

<B>Full auto, or 'CINC Space'</B>

<P>

<P>

    The proposed system would rely heavily on sophisticated computer software to detect missile launches, track the devices as they arced toward space, and try to determine if they were hostile and where they would land. It would launch and guide interceptor missiles to collide with the warheads before they streaked down to their targets.

<P>

    Officials stressed that there will be a human in the decision-making loop.

<P>

    Some analysts, however, believe the relentless time pressure of the perceived attack will drive the system toward full automation.

<P>

     That is particularly true, they said, for a "boost-phase" missile-defense system advocated by, among others, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican nominee. Such a system would intercept missiles within the first five minutes of launch, even before they released their warheads and decoys - perhaps leaving too little time for any human decision at all.

<P>

    But even under the initial system, projected to be in operation at Alaska bases by 2005, the decision to open fire would be made entirely within the military.

<P>

    "There's not enough time to call back and say, 'Can I shoot?' " said Vice Adm. Herbert Browne, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, which would control the system from its headquarters inside Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs, Colo.

<P>

    That decision would fall to the commander in chief of Space Command. At present, that job, called "CINC Space," is held by Air Force Gen. Ralph "Ed" Eberhart.

<P>

    Later, the president would learn from a phone call that the country had gone to war.

<B>A chilling scenario</B>

A dozen U.S. interceptor missiles are launched. They appear on China's primitive early-warning radar, making that nation believe it is under U.S. nuclear attack.

<P>

    In a panic, China launches its nuclear missiles at the United States before they can be destroyed in their silos. That triggers a genuine U.S. nuclear counterattack.

<P>

    Would the risk of having five Korean chemical weapons detonate on American soil be worth a global nuclear holocaust?

<P>

    That's a question "CINC Space" would have to answer, in a heartbeat.

<P>

    "There's going to have to be special trust and confidence placed in the hands of the CINC," Browne said at a recent press briefing.











<P>

<B>Cold War: a simpler time</B>

<P>

<P>

    The problem of response was slightly easier in the early days of the Cold War, when U.S. strategy called for an unthinking "massive retaliation" for what was presumed would be a massive Soviet attack at the climax of a slowly rising crisis.

<P>

    Authorizing such a counterstrike would have been an "awesome" decision, but not an especially tricky one, strategist Walter Slocombe wrote in 1987.

<P>

    "The decision does not particularly lend itself to analysis and could be delegated" from the president to lower-ranking officials should the president be at risk of being killed, wrote Slocombe, now undersecretary of defense. "Far more difficult are the choices that would have to be made in the case of limited attack."

<P>

    "Limited attack" is the most likely risk the United States faces today, according to the most recent CIA assessment.

<P>

    In the strategic environment developing today, for instance, the risk is an attack of one or a handful of missiles by "rogue states" in ambiguous circumstances - in which it might not be clear, for example, whether the launch was deliberate or an accident. Knowing which would be critical in determining the U.S. response.

<P>

    But missile-defense technology is narrowing the opportunity to investigate.

<P>





<P>

<B>'A few tens of seconds'</B>

<P>

<P>

    In the "boost-phase" system, for instance, "you really have a knee-jerk reaction, and you wouldn't know yet what the missiles are intended to do," said Bruce Blair, president of the nonpartisan Center for Defense Information, also in Washington, and a former missile-launch officer.

<P>

    "You'd have a few tens of seconds to detect a launch and fire within another few seconds," Blair said.

<P>

    "What if a country is just going to test a missile? Are we going to knock it out just because it has the range to reach our country? It could be a peaceful space launch."

<P>





<P>

<B>Civilian command bunkers</B>

<P>

<P>

    Those kinds of questions now are considered and debated at places like Site R, where military police occasionally open the massive chain-link front gate to allow military joggers out for a midday run in the hills.

<P>

    In the mid-1980s, a survey by William M. Arkin, an independent researcher, found a "massive and pervasive" system of fortified bunkers like this, where civilian officials would relocate during a nuclear war. Some 350 facilities could, like Site R, provide "post-nuclear-attack operations" including protection from radioactive fallout and food and water, he found.

<P>

    Most of them are maintained today, Arkin said, including a fleet of 18-wheeler trucks carrying mobile command facilities. These are garaged around the country, including Washington, D.C.

<P>

    In addition, the Navy provides airborne command posts in Boeing 707s called TACAMO (for "Take Charge and Move Out") aircraft. These link the president, the secretary of defense and the nation's ballistic-missile submarines.









<P>

<B>Software in charge</B>

<P>

<P>

    At times during the Cold War, limited authority to wage nuclear war was delegated beforehand to military commanders - but only if the president and Cabinet had perished in a massive attack.

<P>

     Today, war authority rests entirely with the "national command authority," the military designation for the president and his secretary of defense and their deputies.

<P>

    But the idea of keeping a civilian, or any human being, "in the decision-making loop" may become obsolete.

<P>

    "In the real world, the human in the loop basically serves as little more than a circuit breaker to prevent the system from going off half-cocked," said John Pike, a space and military-policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.

<P>

    By the time the missile-defense system is operational, the computer software that assesses an attack and analyzes response options "will be the culmination of many thousands of work-years of modeling and calculation and simulation and refinement and testing," Pike said.

<P>

    "The software is going to be in an infinitely better position to make a considered judgment about what should be done than the few human beings sitting in the room," Pike said. "There will be too much stuff going on too fast for any human operators to figure it all out.

<P>

    "There just won't be any time for mere human meddling."
