BOSTON -- So sanguine is Simon Billenness that he seems not the 

least bit downcast by this 

week's United States Supreme 

Court decision overturning the 

Massachusetts "Burma Law," 

which he co-wrote.



<p>  There are, after all, so many 

other economic tools to use 

against companies that support 

the totalitarian regime of Myanmar, formerly Burma. And as a 

super-specialist in just this kind 

of battle,  using financial pressure to fight foreign oppression, 

he knows all of them: divestment campaigns, consumer boycotts, shareholder resolutions, 

the whole gamut.



<p>  Mr. Billenness enumerated 

them as he sat surrounded by 

two-foot-high stacks of paper 

("Here I am working to topple a 

military dictatorship, and I have 

trouble finding things on my desk!" he lamented in the cheery clip of his native Britain) and 

books with titles like "The Anguish of Tibet" 

and "Corporate Crime and Violence."



<p>  The desk belongs to Trillium Asset Management, a Boston concern that, with $675 million 

in client money, labels itself the nation's largest 

and oldest independent investment firm dedicated totally to "socially responsible" investment. 



<p>  Most of Trillium's employees actually work 

investing money, but Mr. Billenness, 35, a senior research analyst, has the particular luxury 

of spending virtually all his time on social 

advocacy, like figuring out how best to support 

the democracy movement in Myanmar, whose 

leaders are accused of torture, forced labor and 

brutal repression.



<p>  To wit: With nary a pause after the Supreme 

Court decision, Mr. Billenness and other members of the Free Burma Coalition, a national 

umbrella group, plan to begin a push this summer to get cities and states to pass new laws 

penalizing companies that do business with 

Myanmar, he said. 



<p>  The Supreme Court's ruling against the Massachusetts law, which largely barred the state 

government from doing business with companies that trade with Myanmar,  was narrow 

enough that it left room for states and cities to 

pass  such home-grown foreign policy measures, Mr. Billenness said. Provided, that is, they 

are not pre-empted by federal law, as the 

Massachusetts measure was.   

<p>



<p>  So there is room for a continued local-global 

campaign that is, not coincidentally, highly 

reminiscent of the movement to fight South 

African apartheid using economic means like 

divestment.



<p>   Here is the Massachusetts link: In 1993, Mr. 

Billenness, a freshly minted M.B.A. from Boston College, went to watch a news conference 

about the end of economic sanctions against 

South Africa. There he met Byron Rushing, a 

prominent legislator who had written the 

state's law on anti-apartheid sanctions. And he 

suggested that Mr. Rushing do something similar for  Myanmar. 



<p>  Mr. Rushing said he would need more information on the country. Mr. Billenness provided 

it, including a statement by Nobel Peace Prize 

laureates  calling for sanctions. 



<p>  Mr. Rushing eventually gave Mr. Billenness a 

copy of the bill he wrote on South Africa sanctions and asked him to adapt it for Myanmar. 

So Mr. Billenness went home, he said, "and 

typed it out word for word, except that whenever I came to 'South Africa,' I put in 'Burma.' 

Then I gave it back to him on a disk, and that's 

how I 'co-authored' the law on Burma."



<p>  Mr. Rushing  introduced the bill in 1994, and it 

passed in 1996. Citing the Massachusetts law, a 

number of companies pulled out of Myanmar, 

among them Apple Computers and Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Billenness said.   

<p>But by 1997, a 

backlash began as well. There was, he said, 

"quite a kerfuffle." 



<p>  The European Commission formally protested, and in 1998, the National Foreign Trade 

Council, a Washington-based association, 

brought suit. The law's opponents said it violated international trade agreements and interfered with the federal government's function of making foreign policy. They won in federal 

court. And now again in the Supreme Court.



<p>  Why was the Myanmar law 

challenged, while the South Africa laws never were? The economy has become so globalized, 

Mr. Billenness said, that more 

than ever, "if you pass a selective purchasing law in any city in 

the world, it will have import far 

beyond its borders."



<p>  That brought trouble for the 

Massachusetts law, but "it 

shows how we as consumers, as 

investors, can use our freedom 

in the marketplace to effect political and social change."



<p>   Mr. Billenness said  he believed "the battle has been more 

important than the result" in 

that the Massachusetts law 

helped bring talk about Myanmar to the forefront. Seventy-eight members of Congress expressed support 

for the law, as did 22 state attorneys general.



<p>  The movement is growing, as reflected in the 

thousands of names on his e-mail lists, all 

collected over the last few years.





<p>  MR. BILLENNESS himself came to the 

"Free Burma" cause in a rather researched, though by no means cold-hearted, way. A native Londoner, he is the 

second son of parents who met at a Young 

Liberals conference and who both remain very 

active in Britain's Liberal Party. He became 

actively Liberal himself by the age of 14, even 

resuscitating a local Young Liberals chapter. 



<p>  When he finished Loughborough University 

in 1985, he married an American -- he has since 

divorced -- came to the United States and 

began working in finance from the ground up, 

as a bank teller. He quickly overcame his initial 

confusion between the American dime and the 

nickel, he said.



<p>  He gravitated toward "socially responsible" 

investing (to this day, he has a Working Assets 

Visa card -- "plastic with purpose" that contributes a percentage of purchases to causes) 

and ultimately worked his way up to his job as 

one of two employees at Trillium who devote all 

their time to social advocacy. In 1992, when he 

was still an intern at the firm, he wrote a report 

on which human rights issues most needed 

attention from concerned investors, and Myanmar was one of them, along with sweatshops 

and China. So it began.



<p>  And so it continues. Last year, Mr. Billenness 

noted, Hootie & the Blowfish, a rock band and 

client of Trillium Asset Management, was playing at a San Diego concert sponsored by Suzuki, 

which is the target of a consumer boycott for 

investing in Myanmar. Guess who provided the 

T-shirts that some of the band members wore 

reading "Suzuki Out of Burma"?
