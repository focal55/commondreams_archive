LONDON  - The collapse of U.N. climate talks

triggered a blizzard of charges and countercharges on Sunday

over who was responsible for the latest failure to reach a pact

on global warming.

<p>World economic powers hurled blame at each other for the

two-week Hague summit's ending without a plan to coordinate

cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>In developing nations, considered most at risk from higher

temperatures, scorn was poured on the failure of the gas-

guzzling rich to stop squabbling over the cost and unite to

tackle climate change.

<p>``The United States remains obsessed with the idea that it

can use the dollar to buy itself out of trouble'' said a

commentary in South Africa's Daily Mail & Guardian under the

headline ``U.S. plays dirty at climate summit.''

<p>The United States, the world's top polluter, pushed a plan

to allow nations to count carbon dioxide soaked up by forests,

so-called carbon sinks, against emissions targets.

<p>``The reason why they (talks) ultimately collapsed was that

U.S. insisted that grasslands and forests should count in

carbon sequestration (limiting),'' an expert associated with the

independent Tata Energy Research Institute said in New Delhi.

<p>``These are natural processes. And they just happen. It is

not fair for the U.S. to count these as additional activities,''

he said. ``The U.S. intransigence is what led to the breakdown.''

<p>The Hague conference had sought agreement on implementing a

pact reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, which called for a five

percent average cut in developed nations' 1990 levels of

emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide by 2010.

<p>Washington, backed by Australia, Canada and Japan, said it

could not reach its targets without such methods. Opponents

said the plan might actually lead to an increase in global

emissions.

<p>``The refusal of some industrial nations to give climate

protection priority at home caused the failure. It also failed

because industrial countries wanted to count too much their

natural forests as a source of man-made reduction rather than

actually cutting greenhouse gases,'' German Environment Minister

Juergen Tritten, a member of the Greens party, said.

<p>Scientists say gases like carbon dioxide threaten

potentially disastrous effects on weather, sea levels and the

spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever.

<p>French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, whose country

holds the EU's rotating presidency, said U.S. proposals had

been unacceptable but held out hope for the Kyoto process.

<p>``It would have been a failure not to wage a battle, to keep

posturing on principles or sign a bad climate agreement,'' she

told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in an interview.

<p>``If despite everything there was a failure, it was in the

sense that we have not finished our work.''

<p>She said she hoped the United States would see reason.

<p>``Maybe they'll realize in the end that a resident of

Houston, Texas, emits five times as much global warming gas as

someone who lives in the Paris region,'' she said.

<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard defended his

country's backing of the U.S. plan.

<p>``It's very important for Australia that that be kept in the

package,'' he told Nine Network television on Sunday.

<p>``It's all right for the Europeans who get the fortuitous

benefits, in the case of Britain for example, in (mining) pit

closures in the 1980s which, ironically enough, the present

British government, then in opposition, bitterly opposed.

<p>``In Australia's case, the way the rules are written, if

those sinks are out, we carry a disproportionate burden.''
