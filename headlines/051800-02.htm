WASHINGTON  - US lawmakers may be shifting toward  

taking action to prevent climate change. On Wednesday the  

Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee convened a hearing  

on the potential impact of global warming.

<P>

Arranged by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who ran  

this year in his party's primaries for the presidential  

nomination, the hearing considered testimony from some of the  

world's leading scientists. 

<P>

McCain said he was motivated to conduct the hearing during his  

primary campaign when young adults across the county had asked him  

what his plan was on global warming. 

<P>

''I don't have a plan,'' said McCain. But, he added ''policy  

makers should be concerned about the mounting evidence that  

something is happening.'' 

<P>

Most scientists - including those at the hearing - agree that the  

so-called 'greenhouse' gas emissions - which are produced by the  

combustion of oil, petrol, coal and other mostly carbon- based  

chemicals - have been gradually warming Earth's atmosphere and  

altering its climate.  

<P>

The past decade has been the warmest ever recorded and 1998 was  

the hottest year in at least 200 years, researchers said.  

<P>

If current record-breaking warming trends continue, average global  

temperatures could rise between one and 3.5 degrees centigrade by  

the year 2050, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  

Change (IPCC), a United Nations scientific body.  

<P>

Scientists said they are witnessing a shift to extreme and  

anomalous weather events.  

While it is not possible to directly prove that droughts and heat  

waves in the United States and Russia or cyclones in India are a  

direct cause of global warming, such events are becoming more  

chronic, said scientists.  

<P>

'''The question is not whether climate will change in response to  

human activities, but rather where, when and by how much,'' said  

Robert Watson, chairman of the IPCC, at the hearing. 

<P>

He said it is clear that climate change will adversely effect  

human health (particularly through the spread of diseases like  

Malaria), ecological systems such as forests and coral reefs, and  

the economy, especially fisheries and agriculture. 

<P>

To address this problem, industrialised nations hammered out what  

has been come to be known as the Kyoto Protocol. Named after the  

Japanese city in which it was drawn up, the agreement calls for 38  

industrialised nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse  

gases by an average of at least five percent below 1990 levels, by  

the year 2012.  

<P>

Claiming that US industry will be at a competitive disadvantage,  

the Senate - many of whose members are financially supported by  

the oil and coal industries - has refused to ratify the treaty  

unless ''key'' developing countries also commit to binding  

limitations and timetables on cuts in emissions.  

<P>

Before the Protocol was signed by President Bill Clinton, the  

Senate passed legislation that prohibited it from ratifying, any  

treaty that ''exempts'' developing nations from legally binding  

mandates or that would cause ''serious economic harm'' to the  

United States.  

<P>

Many environmental groups closely monitoring the debate on climate  

change, praised McCain's efforts to break the political deadlock  

on Kyoto and try to understand the implications of global warming.  

<P>

''If Senator McCain is serious about global warming, it could be  

just the leadership Americans have been waiting for from  

Washington,'' said John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone  

Action.  

<P>

Recently the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee held a hearing on how  

farming practices, such as no-till farming, could reduce carbon  

emissions. During the hearing, several Senators from agricultural  

states publicly stated their belief that global warming needs to  

be addressed. 

<P>

Despite this new momentum in the US Congress, two Republican  

members of the House of Representatives, Joe Knollenberg and Jo  

Ann Emerson have introduced legislation designed to halt any  

funding for programmes that resemble those under the Kyoto  

Protocol, such as carbon emissions trading schemes.  

<P>

''No funds shall be used for the Kyoto Protocol, including such  

Kyoto mechanisms as carbon emissions trading schemes and the Clean  

Development Mechanism that are found solely in the Kyoto Protocol  

and nowhere in the laws of the United States,'' says the proposed  

measure.  

<P>

The legislation has been attached to the House Agriculture  

Appropriations bill.  

<P>

Neal Land, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology,  

strongly denounced the proposal when asked about it at the  

hearing. ''We are very concerned about this,'' he said. ''It  

undermines the ability of the executive branch to conduct  

international negotiations - which seems to me to raise serious  

constitutional questions.'' 

<P>

Depending on how the language of the proposal is interpreted, Land  

said the measure could have a ''chilling effect'' on national  

scientific research abilities. 

<P>

Environmental groups agreed, calling the legislation a ''global  

warming gag rule.'' 

<P>

''Representatives Knollenberg and Emerson would rather quash  

reasonable scientific and policy inquiry than learn more about the  

impacts of pollution that dirties our air and causes global  

warming,'' said Philip Clap, President of the National  

Environmental Trust, an advocacy group here.
