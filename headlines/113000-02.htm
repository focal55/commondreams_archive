RIO DE JANEIRO  - The international trafficking of

human beings, especially of women who are then forced into

prostitution, represents the world's third largest area of

organised crime, and a business that produces seven billion

dollars annually.

<P>

   Greater illegal profits are found only in the drugs and arms

trades, according to data from the United Nations Office for Drug

Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP), released during the

International Seminar on Trafficking in Human Beings, in the

Brazilian capital this week. 

<P>

   Every year, nearly one million women worldwide are victims of

the activity - which amounts to slavery -, says the ODCCP, whose

executive director, Pino Arlacchi, took part in the two-day

seminar ended Wednesday. 

<P>

   Brazil's role in the phenomenon can be seen in the 75,000 women

currently involved in the sex trade in the European Union,

according to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, a non-

governmental organisation in Finland. 

<P>

   Spain is the top destination for such women, who are usually

attracted by offers of employment, good wages and other benefits.

Once they arrive, the smugglers confiscate their passports and

force them to pay back the airline ticket, and other supposed

''travel expenses,'' through prostitution. 

<P>

   Nearly all women - 95 percent - are tricked in similar ways and

subjected to degrading living conditions, according to the Finnish

study. 

<P>

   There are no reliable statistics available to give a precise

idea of the scope of the problem, acknowledged police agents, UN

experts and diplomats participating in the conference. In addition

to being illegal and clandestine, the practice of smuggling

migrants benefits from scant investigation and lack of information

exchanged by authorities on the issue. 

<P>

   Arlacchi, who won fame for his efforts against the Mafia in

Italy, commented that the magnitude of international trafficking

in human beings approaches that of narcotics, but presents greater

difficulties for authorities attempting to fight it. 

<P>

   The Helsinki Foundation points to Brazil as the largest Latin

American source of women engaged in the sex trade in Europe, as

the country is responsible for 15 percent of the region's ''human

exports.'' 

<P>

   Brazil's Foreign Ministry has some idea of the problem's

gravity due to the number of Brazilian women deported back home,

especially from Spain. In 1998 alone, the Spanish authorities

returned 461 women of ''irregular legal status ''to Brazil,

according to consular information. 

<P>

   Portugal, Belgium, France and the Netherlands are other

countries where there are many Brazilian women forced into

prostitution. Brazil's border with Suriname is one of the major

routes for such trafficking in human beings, according to the

International Police (Interpol). 

<P>

   In Portugal, in addition to Brazilians, there are many

Colombian and Eastern European women in prostitution, according to

that country's Assistant Attorney General, Euclides Simaes. 

<P>

   The phenomenon of smuggling emigrant women is most evident in

countries facing war or prolonged economic crisis, which explains

the wave of women coming from countries such as Russia, Ukraine,

Hungary and Romania, pointed out Brazil's Human Rights Secretary

of State, ambassador Gilberto Saboia. 

<P>

   Brazil, he acknowledged, also faces intense internal

trafficking, as young people are forced into prostitution in

''remote areas of the country,'' such as the 'garimpo' zones of

informal gold mining, and along the nation's borders. There are

also reports of many Brazilian women sex workers in Paraguay. 

<P>

   Trafficking in children for illegal adoptions, and workers who

emigrate, fooled by intermediaries who offer nonexistent jobs,

were some of the other concerns addressed by the experts in

Brasilia. 

<P>

   In the case of smuggling children, Saboia stressed that The

Hague Convention, which regulates international adoption, must by

ratified in order to better combat illegal adoptions. 

<P>

   Justice Minister José Gregori signed an accord with Arlacchi

which establishes that the ODCCP is to assist the Brazilian

government in its fight against trafficking in women and children. 

<P>

   In mid-December, Brazil is also to sign the Convention against

Organised Crime, in Palermo, Italy, during an international

meeting to further define mechanisms to combat trafficking of

human beings.
