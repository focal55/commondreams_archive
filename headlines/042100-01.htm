GENEVA -  (IPS) - The United Nations (UN)

Commission on Human Rights released an unsettling

statement about the worsening of international

humanitarian law violations in Colombia and about the

failure to secure a cease-fire in the decades-long

conflict involving the government, guerrilla forces

and paramilitary groups. 

<P>

This South American country saw the reduction last

year in reports of human rights violations in general,

but it was offset by the sharp rise in abuses and

assassinations attributed to right-wing paramilitary

groups, according to the UN commission's report. 

<P>

The commission's presidential office declared its

unequivocal condemnation of the persistent and serious

violations and abuses committed by paramilitary troops

and by leftist guerrillas. 

<P>

The UN statement called on the Colombian government to

take urgent action through appropriate political,

administrative and judicial measures to target

official organisations, members of the government's

armed forces and other individuals suspected of

supporting the paramilitaries. 

<P>

The Commission on Human Rights sees it as a positive

step that the Colombian government has made official

announcements about the issue while working to prevent

the co-operation and collaboration of its armed forces

with paramilitary groups. But charges of such contact

between official and irregular troops must be

investigated immediately, says the commission. <P>

The declaration by this specialised organisation was

based on reports presented by the UN High Commissioner

on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, who has a permanent

office set up in Bogota. 

<P>

Colombia's representatives before international

organisations in Geneva acknowledged the severity of

the UN statement. &quot;It makes demands on the government

- it must be said - to be more efficient in actions

intended to reduce violence and (human rights)

violations,&quot; said a delegate requesting anonymity. 

<P>

The official reaction was generally positive, as

representatives called the commission's declaration

&quot;constructive&quot; even though it requires a major

effort by Colombian authorities to comply with the

recommendations formulated by human rights

organisations. 

<P>

Sources close to the Colombian government expressed

complacency in regard to the declaration's paragraphs

that call for a cease-fire and which condemn the use

of child soldiers and of anti-personnel mines by

guerrilla groups. 

<P>

The UN commission charged the National Liberation Army

(ELN) with committing mass kidnappings and blowing up

electrical towers. It also condemned the country's

largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of

Colombia (FARC), for assassinating foreigners and for

kidnappings. 

<P>

Colombia's non-governmental human rights defence

groups suggested that, in addition to strengthening

the UN High Commissioner's office in Bogota, the

commission should designate a special rapporteur to

follow up on the humanitarian situation of this Andean

nation. 

<P>

But the Colombian activists also applaud the fact that

the severe tone of the UN commission's statement

reflects the serious nature of their country's human

rights problem. 

<P>

The declaration includes key issues, they observed,

such as the worsening of human rights violations, the

ties between government armed forces and the

paramilitary groups, the displacement of tens of

thousands of people caused by the conflict and the

obligation of the government to comply with the

commitments it has assumed in the human rights arena. <P>

The UN commission particularly condemned the ongoing

attacks in Colombia against human rights defenders, as

well as journalists and trade unionists. <P>

The organisation also lamented the persistence of

impunity in cases involving serious crimes, especially

in the military jurisdiction. <P>

The Commission on Human Rights declaration expressed

concern that the consequences of such violence

disproportionately affect minority groups, such as

indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians.
