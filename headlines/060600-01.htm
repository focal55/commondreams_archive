New York -          The adage that money cannot buy happiness may be 

familiar, but is easily forgotten in a consumer society. A much more 

persistent and seductive message is beamed from every television screen: 

Contentment is available for the price of this car, that computer, a little 

more getting and spending.	 



<P>  Over the last few years, however, psychological researchers have been 

amassing an impressive body of data suggesting that satisfaction simply is 

not for sale. Not only does having more things prove to be unfulfilling, but 

also people for whom affluence is a priority in life tend to experience an 

unusual degree of anxiety and depression as well as a lower overall level of 

well-being. Likewise, those who would like nothing more than to be famous or 

attractive do not fare as well, psychologically speaking, as those who 

primarily want to develop close relationships, become more self-aware or 

contribute to the community.	 

</P>

<P>  Earlier research had demonstrated that neither income nor attractiveness 

is strongly correlated with a sense of well-being. But Dr. Richard Ryan, 

professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, and Dr. Tim Kasser, 

a former student who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Knox 

College in Illinois, have discovered that the news is even worse.	 

</P>

<P>  In three sets of studies published in leading psychology journals since 

1993, with a new article this year in Personality and Social Psychology 

Bulletin and still more papers on the way, the researchers sketch an 

increasingly bleak portrait of people who value ``extrinsic goals'' like 

money, fame and beauty.	 

</P>

<P>  Such people are not only more depressed than others, but also report more 

behavioral problems and physical discomfort, as well as scoring lower on 

measures of vitality and self-actualization. While not every study has 

investigated the full list of effects, the pattern that emerges from the 

research project as a whole is remarkably consistent.	 

</P>

<P>  Ryan and Kasser said their studies provided a look at the ``dark side of 

the American dream,'' noting that the culture in some ways seemed to be 

built on precisely what turned out to be detrimental to mental health. 

Americans are encouraged to try to strike it rich, but, ``the more we seek 

satisfactions in material goods, the less we find them there,'' Ryan said. 

``The satisfaction has a short half-life; it's very fleeting.''	 

</P>

<P>  Moreover, the detrimental effect of extrinsic goals seems to hold 

regardless of age or even level of income: A preoccupation with money bodes 

ill regardless of how much money one already has. The effects also appear 

not to be limited to any one culture. Kasser and his associates have now 

collected data from subjects in 13 countries, including Germany, Russia and 

India. The fact that pursuing wealth is psychologically unhelpful and often 

destructive, he reports, ``comes through very strongly in every culture I've 

looked at.''	 

</P>

<P>  Affluence, per se, does not necessarily result in an unsatisfying life. 

Problems are primarily associated with ``living a life where that's your 

focus,'' Ryan said. Nevertheless, the negative psychological picture does 

seem to be associated with the extent to which people believe that they are 

already on the way to attaining extrinsic goals.	 

</P>

<P>  For example, the paper to be published this year surveyed about 300 

youths, some in the United States and some in Russia. In both countries, 

lower levels of mental health were found not only in people who wanted to 

make a lot of money but also in those who thought they were likely to 

succeed at it.	 

</P>

<P>  Another study by the same researchers, not yet accepted for publication, 

found that college students who were already ``relatively high in the 

attainment of appearance, financial success and popularity'' were 

nevertheless ``lower in well-being and self-esteem.'' Those who aspired to 

affluence also had more transient relationships, watched more television and 

were more likely to use cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs than were those 

who placed less emphasis on extrinsic goals.	 

</P>

<P>  Apart from its obvious implications for a culture that thrives on 

material gain, this whole line of research raises questions about the 

proclivity of some psychologists to analyze the dynamics of what is often 

called goal-directed behavior while, in effect, ignoring the nature of the 

goal. Likewise, it challenges homespun advice to ``follow one's dream,'' 

whatever it may be.	 

</P>

<P>  These data strongly suggest that not all goals or dreams are created 

equal. According to the researchers, pursuing goals that reflect genuine 

human needs, like wanting to feel connected to others, turns out to be more 

psychologically beneficial than spending one's life trying to impress others 

or to accumulate trendy clothes, fancy gizmos and the money to keep buying 

them.	 

</P>

<P>  The latter quest may amount to using compensation to try to compensate 

for something more meaningful. The empirical support for this piece of the 

puzzle comes from a particularly provocative study that Kasser and Ryan 

conducted with Dr. Melvin Zax at the University of Rochester and Dr. Arnold 

Sameroff at the University of Michigan. These researchers discovered that 

18-year-

olds for whom financial success was especially important turned out to be 

disproportionately likely to have mothers who were not very nurturing. When 

parents are ``cold and controlling,'' the researchers wrote, ``their 

children apparently focus on attaining security and a sense of worth through 

external sources.''	 

</P>

<P>  This seems consistent with anecdotal accounts of very wealthy men who 

grew up in troubled homes. Such stories are sometimes cited as evidence that 

they made the best of a bad thing, turning out well despite or because of 

their unhappy childhoods. The problem with this interpretation, according to 

the research, is that they may not have turned out so well after all. They 

just turned out wealthy.
