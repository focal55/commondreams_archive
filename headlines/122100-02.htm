BOGOTA, Dec 21 - Plan Colombia', the military assistance

package

between

Colombia and the United States was supposed to launch new

prospects for peace

and development but, at year end, it has instead led to a further

escalation of

the internal armed conflict, and the impact of the strategy has

already begun

to be felt by neighbouring countries, say local analysts. 

<P>

   Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez and U.S.

Ambassador to

Bogota

Anne Patterson launched the Plan Colombia on Sep 28, with the

signing of an

agreement for the first disbursement of 800 million dollars in aid

for the

fight against drug trafficking. 

<P>

   Then, on Dec 2 there was the signing of an accord with a rural

community in

the southeastern department of Putumayo for the eradication of

illicit

crops by

hand which one local magazine Cambio' saw as marking another

starting-point

for the Plan Colombia. 

<P>

   When President Andres Pastrana took office in August 1998, his

chief aims

were to launch peace talks with the guerrillas, reactivate the

slumping

economy, strengthen the justice system and crack down on drug

trafficking. 

<P>

   In early 1999, the Pastrana administration began peace talks

with the

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest rebel

group. 

<P>

   The president also made his first trip to Washington in search

of aid

against the drug trade. But when he got there, ''they changed the

script on

him,'' according to Marco Romero of the Peace Colombia Initiative,

a coalition

created in September by 60 local non-governmental organisations

(NGOs) seeking

an alternative to the Plan Colombia. 

<P>

   Pastrana's talks with U.S. congressional leaders and the head

of the White

House office on National Drug Control Policy, Barry McCaffrey,

gave rise to

the

Plan Colombia, said Romero. 

<P>

   The programme, which the two governments describe as ''an

integrated

strategy for building peace, strengthening the institutions of the

state and

fighting drug trafficking,'' is painted by Romero in a very

different

light. In

fact, the activist labelled it ''a war plan.'' 

<P>

   Romero explained that ''the change in script was seen in how

Congress

earmarked the special aid'' for Colombia requested by President

Bill Clinton. 

<P>

   The price tag on Pastrana's flagship project is seven billion

dollars, four

billion of which will be provided by the Colombian government, and

1.3 billion

of which will come from the United States in the biggest package

of U.S.

aid in

Colombian history. 

<P>

   The Pastrana administration is hoping the rest will be financed

by other

donor countries and multilateral lending institutions. The

governments of

Spain, Japan and Canada and international lenders pledged 871

million dollars

at a meeting of donors held in Madrid in the middle of this year. 

<P>

   The European Union (EU), which the Colombian government hoped

would come

through with the rest of the aid, announced at a second donors

meeting, on Oct

24 in Bogota, that it would provide 300 million dollars from 2000

to 2006, but

on the condition that the aid only be used for infrastructure

works and social

development projects in areas affected by the eradication of drug

crops. 

<P>

   Around 70 percent of the U.S. aid is to go towards financing,

training and

supplying army anti-narcotics battalions operating in southeastern

Colombia, an

area of FARC influence where an estimated 60 percent of Colombia's

coca is

grown. 

<P>

   In support of their request for aid to Colombia, U.S. Secretary

of State

Madeleine Albright and drug czar McCaffrey told the U.S. Congress

that the

funds were to be used for ''restoring order in southeastern

Colombia.'' 

<P>

   McCaffrey said at that time that the Colombian departments of

Caquet and

Putumayo were in the grip of rebel groups, which he said were

largely financed

by drug traffickers operating in the area. 

<P>

   He added that the drug trade and its ties with the insurgents

had become a

national security problem for the United States and for the region

as a whole. 

<P>

   Romero said such remarks substantiated the assertion by peace

activists

that

the U.S. strategy was based on a strengthening of Colombia's armed

forces,

''which would have a hard time obtaining foreign aid otherwise.'' 

<P>

   He said the military component of Pastrana's anti-drug plan was

leading to

the ''narco-tisation'' of the peace process, and to a further

escalation of

the

war, because the guerrillas would respond by building up their

military

capacity. 

<P>

   Jorge Rojas, director of the Consultancy on Human Rights and

Displacement

(Codhes), said the Plan Colombia was part of a ''long-term,

continent-wide

U.S.

strategy that has very precise objectives.'' 

<P>

   Rojas told IPS that under the pretext of the fight against

drugs, control

over national territory, the exploitation of natural resources,

and the

bio-diversity of the Amazon jungle were being put at risk for the

benefit of

the United States. 

<P>

   The Plan Colombia is not a peace plan, he maintained, because

''simply the

announcement of the programme led to an unexpected increase in

armed

activity''

in the department of Putumayo, and the forced displacement of

thousands of

peasant farmers to Ecuador. 

<P>

   Rojas reported that more than 12,000 people had fled to

Ecuador, Peru and

Venezuela from January to September, prompting those countries to

step up 

military controls along their borders with Colombia. 

<P>

   The eradication, by hand, of drug crops by local peasant  

farmers cannot not 

be considered the chief objective of Pastrana's anti-drug efforts,  

the real 

aim 

of which is the destruction of the large plantations and the fight  

against 

bands of drug traffickers, said Rojas. 

<P>

   The agreement signed this month for the voluntary elimination  

of coca crops 

involves 600 families who own a total of 1,580 hectares, of the  

more than 

70,000 hectares planted in coca in Putumayo. The total number of  

hectares 

under 

coca in Colombia is estimated at over 120,000 hectares. 

<P>

   The coordinator of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon  

Basin, Antonio 

Jacanamijoy, said the manual eradication of crops ''could be a  

good measure'' 

if it were carried out in consultation with local communities, if  

the 

agreements reached were respected, and if development alternatives  

were 

provided. 

<P>

   But Jacanamijoy, a member of the Inga ethnic group that resides  

in 

Putumayo, 

told IPS that his community was opposed to the Plan Colombia  

because it had 

not 

been consulted regarding the new strategy which, moreover, failed  

to address 

local needs. 

<P>

   The department of Putumayo, which is now home to some 350,000  

of Colombia's 

40 million people, began to receive a flow of settlers in the  

1950s, who were 

drawn by the prospect of incomes from rubber-tapping. More  

colonists were 

attracted by the oil industry in the 1980s and, more recently, by  

the 

option of 

growing coca. 

<P>

   However, the region was neglected by the state, and is now the  

site of turf 

wars between leftist insurgents and right-wing paramilitaries. 

<P>

   According to Jacanamijoy, ''the debate over the Plan Colombia  

has been 

going 

on for a long time, but it is the inhabitants of Putumayo who are  

suffering 

the 

war in the midst of the most basic unmet needs, such as a lack of  

food, 

channels of communications, health services and education.'' 

<P>

   The EU delegate to the donors meeting in Bogota, Renaud Vignal,  

said the 

European bloc's contribution was focused on social aspects and the 

strengthening of democratic institutions, to back Pastrana's  

efforts for 

peace. 

<P>

   The EU believes Colombia's political conflict requires a  

negotiated 

solution, which it supports. But it will not quarrel with the  

United States, 

its main trading partner, over the Plan Colombia, local analysts  

pointed out. 

<P>

   Jaime Zuluaga, a researcher at the National University's  

Institute of 

Political Studies and International Relations, said it was only to  

be expected 

that some EU countries would have reservations regarding the Plan  

Colombia, 

because ''Pastrana's plan is basically oriented towards an  

escalation of the 

war.'' 

<P>

   Many European countries were upset that the government's plan  

failed to 

take 

into account the views of social or political organisations, or of  

rebel 

groups 

involved in, or planning to engage in, peace talks. 

<P>

   The Peace Colombia Initiative argues that the government  

strategy will have 

a severe impact on small farmers, the weakest link in the drug  

trafficking 

chain. 

<P>

   Andean Action, a private institution dedicated to studying the  

drug 

trade in 

Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, and the Amsterdam-based Transnational  

Institute 

agreed that the eradication of illicit crops would have to form  

part of ''an 

integrated proposal,'' which should be agreed with local  

communities, in order 

to sever the circuit ''of the drug and war economy of armed  

actors,'' the real 

motors behind the drug trade.
