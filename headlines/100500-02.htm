WASHINGTON  - Democrat Al Gore continued to hold a

slight lead over Republican George W. Bush in the Reuters/MSNBC

daily tracking poll released on Thursday, the first to reflect

some impact of Tuesday's presidential debate.

<p>The survey also showed what pollster John Zogby called a

''surge'' of support for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, which

could affect the neck-and-neck presidential race in

battleground states.

<p>The poll, conducted by Zogby, surveyed 1,209 likely voters

between Monday and Wednesday. It found the vice president

leading the Texas governor 46 percent to 40 percent, five weeks

ahead of the Nov. 7 election. Bush dropped a point from

Wednesday's poll while Gore remained steady.<p>``Again this race is very close -- close among voters over

50, close among voters earning more than $50,000, close among

suburban voters and those who have had some college or a

college degree,'' he said.<p>Nader, the third party candidate who was excluded from the

presidential debate in Boston, rose two points to 7 percent in

the new survey.<p>``Gore holds on to his lead, but Nader has picked up

significant support, especially after the debate,'' Zogby said.<p>Nader was up to 17 percent among independents and 18

percent among progressives.<p>``If he continues the same trend, he will have an impact on

several of the battleground states,'' Zogby said.

<p>The Reform Party's Pat Buchanan  had 1 percent of the likely

voters polled, while Libertarian candidate Harry Browne  and

Natural Law's John Hagelin  had less than 1 percent.

<p>Another 7 percent were undecided.<p><font size=+1><b>Poll Shows Debate Impact</b></font><p>Reuters and MSNBC will release a new poll every day until

the election. The surveys are made up of a rolling daily sample

of 400 likely voters each day to create a three-day sample of

about 1,200. The race is now on the outer edge of the

statistical margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage

points.<p>The effect of Tuesday's presidential debate began to be

reflected in Thursday's poll and will be further revealed over

the next two days.
