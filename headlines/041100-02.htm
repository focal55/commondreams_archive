Warning that increases in global water pollution and water shortages pose a

major national security threat to the U.S., Secretary of State Madeleine

Albright on Monday proposed the creation of a world alliance devoted to

preserving water resources.

<P>

   "Environmental threats should be seen for what they are," she said.

"Namely, threats to our security."

<P>Albright told a joint session of the World Resources Institute and U.S.

National Defense University that the competition for water and the economic

and social consequences of unsafe water are contributing to political

extremism and civil strife.

<P>

   "Today, around the world, more than 1 billion people lack access to safe

drinking water," she said. "More than 2 billion live in countries experiencing

some kind of water stress. At least 5 million people die every year from

water-related illness--more than the population of Maryland."

<P>

   The secretary said this means trouble for stability and U.S. interests in

any region where a struggle for water resources exists.

<P>

   "Studies show that the squeeze on water resources will tighten as

populations grow, demand increases, pollution continues and global climate

change accelerates," she said. "As competition for water intensifies, further

disagreements over access and use are likely to erupt. Unless properly

managed, water scarcity can be a major source of strife, as well as a

roadblock to economic and social progress."

<P>

   She called for the U.S. to lead the proposed alliance, despite reported

resentment of America's dominance over other countries as the world's only

superpower. Developing nations are now responsible for about half the

pollution on the planet, Albright said, and the U.S. should take a leadership

role in curbing contamination of the environment because it has long been a

major polluter.

<P>

   "The United States has the world's largest economy," she said. "Our

scientists have designed the best environmental technology. Our society is by

far the largest emitter of the gases that cause global climate change. So we

have both the capacity and the obligation to lead."

<P>

   The secretary said she will begin meetings this summer with other

industrial powers on finding ways to help developing nations with serious

water problems, provided the countries are willing to take action to solve

them.

<P>

   She noted that 130 nations sent representatives last month to a World Water

Forum conference at The Hague, which adopted a declaration that "every person,

everywhere, should have access to enough safe water at an affordable cost."

<P>

   But reality is far different, she said.

<P>

   "Of every two major rivers and lakes on the planet, one is seriously sick,"

Albright said. "On every continent, fresh-water ecosystems have been harmed.

And half the world's wetlands have disappeared."

<P>

   Part of the problem is inefficiency, she said. Some 70 percent of all water

usage in the world goes for agriculture, but as many as three in every five

gallons pumped for irrigation are wasted, she said.

<P>

   Improved irrigation technology developed by the U.S. can reduce the waste,

she said.

<P>

   Albright said that, despite continuing tensions and strife, countries in

the Middle East are beginning cooperative efforts to improve mutual "water

security" there.

<P>

   She said that during a visit next week to central Asia she will confer with

leaders of former Soviet republics about water quality problems, which she

said were caused in part by practices implemented under communism. "The two

river systems of the Aral Sea basin are sorely degraded," she said.

<P>

   The secretary complained that "pollution, poorly placed dams and flooding"

have threatened the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia, which supports 250

million people.

<P>

   She also said international cooperation by adjoining nations has made

considerable progress in improving the quality of the Nile, the world's

longest river. But the rest of Africa is in serious trouble, Albright said.

<P>

   "More Africans lack access to safe water now than a decade ago," she said.

"Almost half the people on the continent suffer from water-related disease.

The result is economically crippling and, from a humanitarian standpoint,

flat-out unacceptable."
