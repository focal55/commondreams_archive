PARIS - A French state prosecutor has launched a

preliminary judicial investigation into the workings of the

United States' Echelon spy system of satellites and listening

posts, the prosecutor's office said Tuesday.

<p>Echelon, set up during the Cold War, can intercept millions

of telephone, fax and e-mail messages, and Washington has been

accused of using it for economic espionage against its allies, a

charge it denies.

<p>The investigation, which could spark a diplomatic row with

the United States, would not necessarily lead to legal action, a

spokesman for prosecutor Jean-Pierre Dintilhac told reporters.

<p>Coincidentally, the European Parliament is due to decide in

Strasbourg Wednesday whether to set up a commission to

investigate whether Echelon infringes the rights of European

citizens and industries.

<p>Dintilhac's office began the preliminary investigation in

response to a letter by a French center-right member of the

European parliament, Thierry Jean-Pierre, who alleged Echelon

was potentially prejudicial to French nationals and to France's

economic interests.

<p>Dintilhac has ordered the state counter-intelligence agency

DST to find out whether Echelon's activities could be qualified

under French law as ``harmful to the vital interests of the

(French) nation.''

<p>Confirmation would lead to legal proceedings, though it was

difficult to see how a U.S. government agency could be sued in a

French court.

<p>A report submitted to the European parliament by a British

researcher last October said Echelon's eavesdropping activities

had resulted in several major contracts going to U.S. rather

than European firms.

<p>In particular, it cited a 1994 attempt by the French-led

European Airbus consortium to break the U.S. hold on airliner

sales to Saudi Arabia.

<p>In 1995, France expelled five U.S. diplomats and officials,

one of them the alleged Paris station chief for the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), in connection with the case.

<p>Current CIA director George Tenet said last March, as

controversy over Echelon spread to include charges that it also

spied on U.S. citizens, that the United States did not spy on

foreign firms to give American companies competitive advantage.

<p>But his predecessor James Woolsey, CIA director at the time

when the U.S. is alleged to have used Echelon to beat Airbus to

the Saudi deal, said this year that Washington had found that

Airbus agents were offering bribes to a Saudi official.

<p>David Nataf, a Paris lawyer representing French firms and

individuals who say they have suffered from infringement of

privacy by U.S. government agencies, told Reuters that

Dintilhac's action came as ``a divine surprise.''

<p>He said French courts had so far been far quicker at

replying to requests for action by U.S. government agencies

against French nationals than they were at handling cases

against official American bodies.

<p>``The truth is, our justice system is usually at its fastest

when it is asked by the (US) Federal Bureau of Investigation or

U.S. Air Force to take action against teenage hackers in this

country,'' Nataf said.

<p>The lawyer said he would seek to link the complaints he

lodged last December, but to which no magistrate has so far been

assigned, with Dintilhac's action. Nataf declined to immediately

name his clients for legal reasons.
