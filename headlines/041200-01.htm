A multibillion-dollar system designed to protect the United States against a ballistic missile attack by a "rogue" state could be defeated by simple countermeasures and should not be built, a panel of prominent U.S. scientists said yesterday.  

<P>The panel, affiliated with the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concluded that the Pentagon's planned antimissile shield would be unable to cope with a warhead that subdivides into hundreds of bomblets, a likely scenario in a chemical or biological attack.</P>

<P>In addition, the scientists said, an adversary easily could confuse the system's radar by concealing a nuclear warhead inside a mylar balloon and releasing dozens of decoy balloons. Or, the adversary could cool the warhead's nose cone with liquid nitrogen to foil the U.S. system's heat sensors, they said.</P>

<P>"Any country that can deploy a long-range missile with a nuclear or biological weapon can deploy these countermeasures," said Lisbeth Gronlund, a physicist and missile defense expert in MIT's Security Studies Program. "Pentagon claims that the system can deal with countermeasures simply do not stand up to technical scrutiny."</P>

<P>Gronlund said the panel's 175-page study, entitled "Countermeasures," is the first independent, technical evaluation of the current plan for national missile defense. "This is basic physics, and it's airtight," she said. "It's as close to a proof as you can get that the system won't work."</P>

<P>Mike Biddle, a spokesman for the Pentagon's National Missile Defense Joint Program Office, wasn't impressed. "We continue to assert that the system we are developing will be effective against the envisioned rogue [missile] threat of 2005," Biddle said.</P>

<P>President Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead with construction of a limited national missile defense system, starting with 100 interceptors in Alaska. The price tag would be at least $12.7 billion over the next six years and $30.2 billion over the next 25 years, according to the latest Pentagon estimates.</P>

<P>In its first flight test last October, the system's "kill vehicle" succeeded in hitting a dummy warhead high over the Pacific Ocean. But the interceptor missed its target in a second test in January. A third test--the final one before Clinton's decision--is now scheduled for late June.</P>

<P>Biddle said at least 17 more tests are planned before Pentagon officials select the kill vehicle's final design in 2003. During those tests, he said, kill vehicles will have to find their targets amongst an array of decoys and countermeasures.</P>

<P>But in the study released yesterday, the scientists concluded that none of the three tests prior to Clinton's deployment decision have been designed to determine whether the system would be effective against countermeasures.</P>

<P>"Since we find that even the full system would be defeated by realistic countermeasures, it makes no sense to begin deployment," said Andrew Sessler, a former director of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and past president of the American Physical Society. "A defense that doesn't work is no defense at all."</P>

<P>The scientists noted that U.S. intelligence agencies reported last fall that China already has developed countermeasures and that North Korea, Iraq and Iran could reasonably be expected to do the same.</P>

<P>The scientists also argued that deployment of the national missile defense system could "produce a net decrease in . . . national security" by prodding China to build up its force of intercontinental ballistic missiles--now numbering only about 20--to be sure that it has a credible nuclear deterrent.</P>

<P>Before constructing a national missile defense system, the United States also would have to amend or scrap the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a cornerstone of arms control agreements since 1972. The scientists warned that irritating Russia by forcing changes in the ABM Treaty could jeopardize efforts to secure Russia's nuclear stockpile and prevent an accidental Russian missile launch, which they argued is an even greater risk than a missile attack by a state such as Iran or North Korea.</P>
