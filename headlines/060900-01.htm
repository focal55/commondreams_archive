Citing the Pentagon's own plan, 

critics of the proposed antimissile 

defense  and even some military experts say  all flight tests of the $60 

billion  weapon have been rigged to 

hide a fundamental flaw: The system cannot  distinguish between enemy warheads and decoys.



<p>      In interviews, they said that after 

the system failed to achieve this crucial discrimination goal against 

mock targets in its first two flight 

tests, the Pentagon substituted simpler and fewer decoys that would be 

easier for the antimissile weapon to 

recognize.



<p>      The Pentagon's plan was obtained 

by Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute 

of Technology who opposes the weapon. It covers  the four tests that have 

taken place as well as future tests up 

to the system's projected deployment in 2005.   

<p>



<p>  Other technical experts who have 

seen it, including both antimissile 

and decoy designers, concurred with 

his criticism, as did a senior government official who has examined the 

Pentagon's testing plan.



<p>      "It is clear to me," said the official,   who spoke on condition of anonymity,  "that none of the tests address the reasonable range of countermeasures," or decoys that an enemy would use to try to outwit an 

antimissile weapon.



<p> While acknowledging the plan Dr. 

Postal obtained as authentic, Pentagon officials strongly defended the 

testing program. Lt. Gen. Ronald T. 

Kadish of the Air Force, director of 

the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization,  denied that his 

program had engaged in any deception or dumbing down. General Kadish  said the testing program would 

be extremely useful and the resulting weapon would defeat crude warheads launched by inexperienced nuclear powers that might emerge in 

the future, like Iran, Iraq or North 

Korea.   

<p>



<p>        Though unclassified, the plan is 

considered sensitive. Dr. Postol said 

he obtained it from a Pentagon 

 source he would not identify.



<p>      Dr. Postol, who  is preparing a report for the White House on what he 

sees as the plan's flaws,  made his 

argument on Monday  at a meeting of 

the State Department's advisory 

board on arms control, along with 

another antimissile critic, Nira 

Schwartz. Dr. Schwartz, a former 

senior engineer at the military  contractor TRW, lost her job after after 

challenging the claims the company 

made about the weapon's ability to 

distinguish warheads from decoys. 



<p>      Dr. Postol,  who worked in the Reagan Administration on such issues as 

antimissile defense, says that the 

Pentagon has ignored earlier criticism like Dr. Schwartz's  and instead 

put flawed testing methods at the 

heart of all its plans to develop and 

build a weapon. The upshot, he says, 

is that any real attacker -- no matter 

how inexperienced -- would be able 

to easily outwit the weapon.



<p>      Pentagon officials "are systematically lying about the performance of 

a weapon system that is supposed to 

defend the people of the United 

States from nuclear attack," Dr. 

Postol said in an interview.



<p>      General Kadish conceded that 

 "this technology is difficult." As a 

result, he said,  his organization's approach  "is to walk before we run, 

with increasingly stressful decoys to 

match what we expect" by way of 

enemy threats. "When we get to that 

end point," he said,  "we'll have the 

confidence to put this on alert."



<p>      But far from increasing the complexity of future tests, the Pentagon 

has made them easier, military experts who examined the testing plan 

agreed.   

<p>Two rigorous  experiments, 

in 1997 and 1998,  to have the weapon 

simply observe the targets, they 

said, have been followed by interception tests designed to make discriminating between decoys and mock 

warheads as easy as possible.



<p>      "They did a good fox trot for the 

first couple of tests and then slowed 

down to a crawl," said Bob Dietz, a 

retired former designer of warhead 

decoys for American missiles. "You 

have to ask why they don't build 

better decoys. They've always said 

they'd get better with time."



<p>     Michael W. Munn, a retired scientist for the military  contractor Lockheed and a pioneer in designing and 

testing antimissile weapons, said: 

 "The only way to make it work is to 

dumb it down. There's no other way 

to do it. Discrimination has always 

been the No. 1  problem, and it will 

always remain that way."



<p>      He said manipulation of antimissile flight tests was nothing new. 



<p>"It's always been a wicked game," 

Mr. Munn  said.



<p>      The Pentagon itself is sharply divided on the testing issue. In February, Philip E. Coyle III, the Defense 

Department's director of testing and 

evaluation, faulted the antimissile 

tests as insufficiently realistic to 

 make decisions  about moving  from 

research to building the weapon.



<p>      The 16 interception test flights 

called for in the development program would cost at least $1.6 billion, 

Pentagon experts say. So far, the two 

observation tests have been followed 

by two interception attempts, the 

first successful, the second a failure. 

Another test is scheduled in July.



<p>      The Clinton administration plans 

to make a decision later this year on 

whether to start building the antimissile  system, which is to shield the 

United States from limited missile 

attacks by so-called rogue states.



<p>      Dr. Postol, a professor of science 

and national security studies at 

M.I.T. and the author of many private and federal weapon reports, 

was a top Navy science adviser in 

the Reagan Administration and for 

decades has studied enemy countermeasures to antimissile weapons.



<p>      After the 1991 Persian Gulf war, he 

challenged the Army's claims of success for its Patriot antimissile system, saying it had,  in fact,  destroyed 

no Iraqi missiles at all. Though the 

Pentagon at first denied his assertion, it later conceded that initial 

reports of the Patriot success had 

been exaggerated.



<p>      The current scientific fray centers 

on the interceptor's 120-pound homing device, known as a   kill vehicle. 

Fired on a rocket, it is designed to 

use  a telescopic sensor, a computer 

and jet thrusters to steer itself 

through space toward a warhead, 

destroying it by force of impact.



<p>      Dr. Postol's critique involves its 

hardest job, distinguishing between 

actual enemy warheads and the 

cloud of decoys considered sure to be 

launched to disguise them. If unable 

to tell decoys from warheads, a defender would be forced to fire interceptors at every threatening object, 

quickly exhausting a defensive force.



<p>Dr. Postol began digging into the 

first antimissile flight test, in June 

1997, after reviewing Pentagon data 

gathered by  Dr. Schwartz. 



<p>The sensors at issue are cooled to 

more than 300 degrees below zero 

and work in the icy void of space to 

track faint heat emissions from 

warm targets, just as ordinary telescopes track light. They see  warheads and decoys as twinkling points 

of light, like stars.



<p>The June 1997 flight test, Dr. Postol asserted,  showed that the infrared twinkles were random and insufficiently different from one another 

to let the interceptor distinguish 

among them, and that the Pentagon 

had conspired to hide this surprising 

discovery.   

<p>The Pentagon, he said, 

 has altered future tests to  artificially 

heighten any  differences that could 

be detected between  warheads and 

decoys.



<p>His accusation is based mainly on 

a detailed chart from the Pentagon's 

Ballistic Missile Defense Organization that gives an overview of its 

program for Integrated Flight Tests 

of the kill vehicle. Entitled "I.F.T. 

Targets Selections," the chart is dated May 5, 2000,  and at the top is 

labeled "For Planning Purposes." 

The chart's bottom warns, "Configuration controlled by N.M.D. J.P.O.," 

or the National Missile Defense Joint 

Program Office. "Do not alter this 

document."



<p>The chart starts with the June 1997 

test, lists another sensor flight  and 

then goes through the 16 intercept 

tests scheduled for the kill vehicle's 

entire development. The last flight is 

listed as June 2004, right before the 

antimissile weapon is to begin operating in 2005. In each case, the chart 

spells out the exact type and number 

of test decoys and warheads and 

depicts them in small pictures.



<p>Dr. Postol said the chart shows 

how the initial suite of challenging 

decoys, the ones that twinkled a lot, 

making them hard to distinguish 

from a warhead,  had been replaced 

by fewer and simpler decoys  that 

twinkled as little as possible, accentuating their differences from  warheads that fluctuate a lot in infrared 

intensity.



<p>Long and conelike, pointy at one 

end, flat at the other, the warheads 

can wobble and shift in complex 

ways while moving through space, 

presenting differing heat emissions 

to a distant sensor. By contrast,  the 

spherical decoy balloons have  more 

uniform signatures.



<p>The removed decoys, Dr. Postol 

said in his report, all had infrared 

signatures similar to the  warheads. 

Abandoned  were spherical balloons 

whose stripes made their infrared 

emissions fluctuate, rigid decoys 

that looked like  warheads and balloons that inflated to conelike shapes.



<p>"These decoys," he wrote, "have 

brightness and time-dependent oscillating signals that can be quite similar to the signals from either warheads that are spinning around their 

axis of symmetry, or tumbling end 

over end."



<p>The only retained decoys, he said, 

were spherical, uniform in materials 

and substantially brighter or dimmer than  warheads. Their signatures, he said, "will have very uniform and controlled intensities."



<p>All the program's interception 

tests, Dr. Postol said  in the draft 

report to the White House, "have 

been carefully orchestrated to avoid 

encountering the discrimination 

problems."        In an interview, he said 

he hoped to get the report, a draft of 

which runs to 20 pages, to the White 

House next week.



<p>General Kadish, while saying the 

planning chart was authentic, if tentative, strongly denied that the testing program had been structured to 

become increasingly easy. To the 

contrary, he said, the decoys were 

selected to make the evolving tests 

increasingly hard.



<p>"Complexity is increasing," he 

said.



<p>Asked how a smooth balloon could 

be more difficult to track than a rigid 

decoy shaped to look like a warhead, 

he replied, "That's a valid technical 

argument," but he added that just 

because a decoy seemed effective 

"doesn't mean its credible."



<p>The test program, he said, was 

structured to make the weapon flexible and robust. Testing it against 

decoy shapes that were too specific 

might allow an enemy to fool the 

weapon by changing them "a little 

bit," General Kadish said. "What 

we're after is a basic physics approach."



<p>Previously, Pentagon officials 

have said they reduced  the complexity of some antimissile testing when 

the government cut the program's 

goal from trying to knock out advanced warheads from countries like 

Russia and China to more primitive 

ones from rogue states. 



<p>Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air 

Force, an antimissile spokesman, 

said the current testing diagram depicts provisional goals rather than a 

hard-and-fast plan. The only decoy 

configuration  set in concrete, he added, was the next test flight, which has 

been delayed repeatedly and is now 

scheduled for the first week of July.



<p>Yesterday, Dr. Postol belittled the 

Pentagon's retorts, saying they    were 

misrepresenting the program's logic. "They've been caught in one outright lie after another," he said.
