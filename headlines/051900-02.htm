WASHINGTON<wbr>--<wbr>The U.S. intelligence community is writing a secret report warning

the Clinton administration that construction of a national missile

defense could trigger a wave of destabilizing events around the world and

possibly endanger relations with European allies, a U.S. intelligence

official said Thursday.

<p>The new National Intelligence Estimate will sketch an unsettling

series of political and military ripple effects from the proposed U.S.

deployment that would include a sharp buildup of strategic and

medium-range nuclear missiles by China, India and Pakistan and the

further spread of missile technology in the Middle East.

<p>A supplement to the highly classified report will also note that the

threat of attack from North Korea has eased since last fall, when

Pyongyang effectively froze its ballistic-missile testing program in

response to U.S. overtures.

<p>Outside critics have long argued that the proposed national missile

defense could backfire and actually diminish national security and global

stability. But the CIA-led analysis and updated threat assessment are the

first official evaluation of how the system could generate new threats.

<p>The administration has pledged to decide this fall whether to proceed

with an initial base of 100 "interceptor" missiles in Alaska, backed by

ground-based phased radar stations and satellite-based infrared sensors,

in a system designed to shield the continental United States from a

limited missile attack.

<p>Proponents of the system argue that North Korea, Iran or Iraq may

threaten U.S. territory with intercontinental ballistic missiles someday.

Critics argue that the threat is exaggerated, that the antimissile

technology is unproved and that deployment would undermine crucial arms

control and nonproliferation regimes.

<p>CIA analysts believe that Russia would accept U.S. arguments that no

system could protect against the number of missiles Moscow could launch

and that its deterrent thus would be preserved. But China has only 20

CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missiles in vulnerable silos, and the

analysts say that, after a U.S. deployment, Beijing would conclude that

it had lost its deterrent force--and act accordingly.

<p>"We can tell the Russians that [the missile defense] won't affect the

viability of their deterrent force," the intelligence official said. "I

don't know how we can say that to the Chinese with a straight face."

<p>If the U.S. system is built, the CIA believes, China would install

multiple independent nuclear warheads on its missiles for the first time

in an effort to overwhelm any missile shield. Beijing has possessed the

technology for more than a decade but has not used it so far.

<p>In addition, Beijing is deemed likely to build several dozen mobile

truck-based DF-31 missiles, which it first tested last year, to create a

more survivable force. It also is likely to add such countermeasures as

booster fragmentation, low-power jammers, chaff and simple decoys to

confuse or evade U.S. interceptors.

<p>The intelligence official said that Russia and China both would

increase proliferation, including "selling countermeasures for sure" to

such nations as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

<p>Moreover, the official said, India is deemed likely to increase its

nuclear missile force if it detects a sharp buildup by China, its

neighbor and longtime rival. That, in turn, likely would spur Pakistan,

India's archenemy, to increase its own nuclear strike force, the official

said.

<p>Former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft called such a

scenario "plausible" and expressed concern about its possible

implications.

<p>"We ought to think whether we want the Chinese to change their very

minimalist strategy," he said in a telephone interview. "I'm not sure

what the answer is, but this is certainly one of the possible

consequences that, in a sense, is more serious than the Russian reaction

might be."

<b><br>

<p>The Likelihood of a Domino Effect

</b>

<p>Other specialists said that, while it is likely China would move to

increase its intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal--now thought to

be about 20 strong--it is questionable whether India and Pakistan would

follow suit.

<p>"China has had a strategic capability for a long time relative to

India, and India has hardly gone on a missile arms race to counter it,"

noted John E. Peters, an arms control specialist at Rand Corp., a Santa

Monica-based think tank.

<p>Michael O'Hanlin, who tracks the missile defense issue at the

Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, argued

that, however dramatic it may sound, a domino-style nuclear arms buildup

would be a lesser threat to the United States than China's potential

willingness to develop and sell missile defense countermeasures to

countries like North Korea. Arms control specialists have expressed

strong concern that the missile defense system as designed would be

incapable of overcoming relatively cheap and easy-to-deploy

countermeasures, such as clusters of decoys.

<p>"If they do that, it could defeat the entire purpose of the national

missile defense," O'Hanlin said. "That is the scenario that's very

important."

<p>Further afield, the intelligence official who outlined the report

said, America's allies in Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty

Organization could be angered if the United States is seen to be walling

itself off from its allies with an antimissile shield.

<b><br>

<p>N. Korea's Test Program Frozen

</b>

<p>The updated threat assessment notes that North Korea has frozen its

program to test an intercontinental ballistic missile--the Taepo-Dong

2--since the administration proposed relaxing economic and diplomatic

sanctions last year.

<p>The missile still could be tested on short notice, the official said,

and related tests of the system's electronics, pumps, tanks and other

equipment are still going on.

<p>CIA analysts, who warned last year that Iran may try to test an

intercontinental ballistic missile by 2010, have detected little progress

in Tehran's program. "We're not seeing some of the things we expected,"

the official said. "We're not seeing the threat advance."

<p>The White House requested the intelligence estimate as part of its

decision-making review.

<p>The analysis, to be delivered next month, presents two different

scenarios of how other nations are likely to react to a U.S. deployment.

<p>The first is based on the premise that Russia agrees to U.S. demands

to amend the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty of 1972 to allow a missile

shield. The second assesses the effect if Russia refuses and Washington

simply abandons the arms control process, as many Republicans have

demanded.

<p>At the moment, Russia and China are the only potential adversaries

capable of hitting the United States with nuclear missiles. Russia has

about 1,000 strategic missiles and 4,500 warheads.

<p>The report pointedly declines to describe North Korea and other

hostile states as "rogue" nations, since the argot suggests that their

leaders are irrational.

<p>"The term rogue state almost predisposes you in favor of" the missile

defense system, the intelligence official said.

<p>Moreover, the report warns that the missile defense shield would not

protect Americans against what the official called "more accurate, more

reliable and much cheaper" ways of delivering chemical, biological or

nuclear weapons. These include ship-launched missiles, suitcase bombs and

other covert means.

<p>"The joke here is, if you want to bring a nuclear weapon into the

United States, just hide it in some drugs," the official said.
