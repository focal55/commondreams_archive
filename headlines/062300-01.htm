WASHINGTON - Months 

after they dismissed Ralph Nader as 

a fringe third-party candidate who 

would fade quickly, Democratic and 

Republican strategists now say 

he has emerged as more politically 

potent than Patrick J. Buchanan and 

could deeply complicate the candidacy of Vice President Al Gore.

									</table></font></font></font>Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate 

who is expected to capture the Green 

Party's nomination in Denver this 

weekend, is in single digits in most 

polls. No one thinks he has a chance 

of rising to the electoral heights of 

Ross Perot in 1992, who at this point 

in that campaign had the support of 

about a third of the voters in many 

polls.   

<p>And few people predict that he 

will reach the 15 percent threshold 

required to assure a spot in the nationally televised candidate debates 

this fall.



<p> Even so, Mr. Nader is already 

forcing Mr. Gore to compete more 

vigorously for the active support of 

labor and other groups that are reliably Democratic. And many pollsters and analysts said that in a tight 

race with Gov. George W. Bush, a 

few points could make a difference 

-- and force Mr. Gore to reconsider 

his electoral calculations in important states.



<p>  In a close race, Mr. Nader could tip 

the balance in Michigan, Ohio and  

other swing states of the Midwest. In 

California, where Mr. Gore is running comfortably ahead, a Field Poll 

this week showed Mr. Nader drawing 

7 percent. And a  Quinnipiac University poll in Connecticut this week 

showed he had 9 percent. Mr. Nader 

is also showing strength in New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.



<p> More troubling for some Democrats is that Mr. Nader, who has 

ridiculed Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush as 

sounding identical and has emphasized his record as a consumer and 

environmental advocate, is becoming more and more popular with 

organized labor. By campaigning aggressively against the China trade 

deal, which passed in the House last 

month, Mr. Nader has effectively 

capitalized on labor's distress with 

Mr. Gore for his support of the measure.



<p> In doing so, Mr. Nader has made 

Mr. Gore battle for a constituency 

that his campaign thought it could 

count on. In fact, pollsters say most 

of Mr. Nader's backers are not the 

swing voters that Mr. Gore needs to 

win over, but staunch Democrats 

who should already be on his side.



<p> "The Bush people, I'm sure, are 

thrilled about Nader," said one of 

Mr. Gore's most senior aides.



<p> Mr. Nader's potential for trouble 

was on display here today, when 

James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, appeared beside him at a news 

conference and ridiculed the vice 

president.



<p> "There is no distinction between 

Al Gore and George W. Bush when it 

comes to trade," Mr. Hoffa asserted 

after Mr. Nader met privately with 

the Teamsters' 24-member executive board. He added that Mr. Gore 

was "wrong on trade" and said, "We 

agree wholeheartedly with what Mr. 

Nader has said." Mr. Nader won a 

standing ovation from the board.



<p> Imploring the audience to take 

him seriously, Mr. Nader said: "People are always asking, 'Am I worried 

about taking votes away from Gore?' 

No. I'm worried about Gore taking 

votes away from me."



<p> Gore advisers said they had 

moved aggressively behind the 

scenes to try to keep Mr. Hoffa from 

endorsing Mr. Nader, to the point 

where they had directed projects 

through federal agencies that would 

use Teamsters.



<p> Those efforts may be paying off -- 

at least for now. "We're not going to 

hurry to endorse," Mr. Hoffa said 

today. But even Gore aides said a 

Teamsters endorsement of the vice 

president seemed increasingly less 

likely.



<p> "We have options of endorsing or 

not endorsing," Mr. Hoffa added.



<p>    Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the 

assistant Democratic leader who is a 

Gore loyalist, contacted several labor leaders today, discouraging 

them from defecting to Mr. Nader. In 

an interview, he bluntly condemned 

Mr. Nader as a spoiler.



<p> "Ralph Nader is a very selfish 

person and he's on an ego trip," Mr. 

Reid said. "He has no respect for the 

process."



<p>    Mr. Gore had never anticipated 

new headaches with labor, given that 

he had to struggle last fall to win the 

A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement against 

former Senator Bill Bradley. Now, 

not only have the Teamsters not rallied behind Mr. Gore, but he is also 

struggling for backing from the United Automobile Workers. The Teamsters have 1.4 million members; the 

U.A.W. has 800,000.



<p> Earlier this year, most political 

strategists viewed Mr. Buchanan as 

the biggest threat -- and a potentially big problem for Mr. Bush. He has 

run twice for the Republican presidential nomination, even winning the 

critical New Hampshire primary in 

1996. And if he wins the backing of 

the Reform Party, whose nomination 

he is seeking, he would draw $12.6 

million in federal money.



<p> But even if Mr. Buchanan gets that 

money, strategists now say Mr. Nader has a greater potential impact on 

the race because polls show that he 

takes his support almost exclusively 

from Mr. Gore. Mr. Buchanan, with 

backing both from protectionist 

Democrats and conservative Republicans, does not have as much potential to wound Mr. Bush.



<p>      Even with the Reform Party nomination, Mr. Buchanan  would be 

weakened because many in that party do not like him. And despite Mr. 

Buchanan's staunch position against 

free trade, many unions see Mr. Nader as more of a soulmate because, 

unlike Mr. Buchanan, he is not conservative on social issues.



<p>   Over all, Mr. Nader is a far more 

popular figure than the controversial 

Mr. Buchanan. Fifty percent of registered voters have a negative view of 

Mr. Buchanan, while only 15 percent 

have a negative view of Mr. Nader, 

according to an NBC News/Wall 

Street Journal poll taken June 14-18. 

The poll found that 12 percent had a 

positive view of Mr. Buchanan, while 

33 percent had a positive view of Mr. 

Nader.



<p> "I would hate to be Al Gore looking 

at the third-party horizon this  year," 

said J. David Gillespie, a political 

scientist at Presbyterian College in 

Clinton, S.C., who is an authority on 

third-party candidacies. "Nader's 

draw in key states may be very 

crucial in determining the outcome 

of this election."



<p> The strategy of the Gore and Bush 

campaigns thus far has been to ignore Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan, 

and not do anything to raise their 

profiles. 



<p>    Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National 

Committee, echoing some Gore advisers, insisted that he was not at all 

unsettled by Mr. Nader. "I'm not 

worried about it," he said. "It doesn't 

make much difference if Ralph Nader is an angel or not: people aren't 

going to throw their votes away." 



<p> Most voters, he said, do not know 

much about Mr. Nader -- and his 

backers will sour on him when they 

realize he is just "a human being" 

and not a loftier figure. "He's 

reached his high point right now," 

Mr. Andrew said.



<p> A strategist for Mr. Gore put it this 

way: "In June, you're wasting your 

energy if you worry about these 

things. In October, it would be worrisome."
