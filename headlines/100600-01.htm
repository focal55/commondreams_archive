UNITED NATIONS, Oct 5  - The widespread belief among Third

World nations

is that the five permanent members of the Security Council - the

United

States,

Britain, France, China and Russia - are not the only ones wielding

veto powers

at the United Nations. 

<P>

Lurking behind the United States is a sixth UN member state, which

for the

last

50 years, has indirectly - and meticulously - exercised its own

brand of veto

through a proxy. 

<P>

''Whenever the US vetoes a Security Council resolution critical of

Israel,''

says one Arab diplomat, ''we always see the hidden hand of the

Israelis.''  

<P>

</TABLE></font>That hidden hand may be visible once again as the United States is

poised to

cast its veto against a UN draft resolution sponsored by the 114-

member

Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) calling for an international inquiry

into the

killings of over 45 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza since

last week. 

<P>

The resolution, which is expected to be taken up later this week,

faces a

possible US veto because Israel has made it clear it will not

permit any

international investigation into the shootings. 

<P>

The proposed investigation is also one of the demands made by

Palestinian

leader Yassir Arafat Wednesday at the Paris talks involving

Israeli Prime

Minister Ehud Barak and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 

<P>

Arafat has also demanded an immediate cease-fire and the

withdrawal of all

Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza. 

<P>

Ambassador Richard Holbrooke of the United States has argued that

the first

priority must be to stop the violence. ''Now was not the time to

apportion

blame,'' he told the Council. 

<P>

''Too often in the past, positions taken by this Council, and by

the UN

itself,

had tarnished the Organisation's credibility and undermined its

ability to

play

a constructive role in the peace process,'' he said. 

<P>

The US argument is also that any attempts to probe the killings

will undermine

the ongoing peace process in the Middle East. 

<P>

A Third World diplomat told IPS that he could not understand why

the United

States should oppose such a probe when it has supported several

such

investigations, including visits by members of the Security

Council, into some

of the trouble spots in Africa, including the Democratic Republic

of the Congo

and Sierra Leone. 

<P>

If, however, the resolution is vetoed by the United States, there

is a strong

likelihood that NAM will call for a special session of the UN

Human Rights

Commission (HRC) in Geneva to probe the use of deadly force by the

Israelis.

Two similar special sessions were held earlier in Geneva to

investigate human

rights violations in East Timor and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 

<P>

Addressing a meeting of the Security Council Wednesday, the UN

Permanent

Observer for Palestine Nasser al-Kidwa said the way in which

Israel had

reacted

to the Palestinian protest was no surprise. 

<P>

''They had used large amounts of military power, snipers, live

ammunition,

hand

grenades, anti-tank missiles and helicopter gun-ships, moving

battle tanks to

Palestinian towns,'' he said. 

<P>

The Israeli army, he charged, tried to inflict great losses on the

Palestinians, using unprecedented military force. Their actions

were in gross

violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the protection of

civilians in

times

of war. 

<P>

''The perpetrators must be brought to trial and punished,'' he

added.  

<P>

He also asked the Security Council to put an end to ''the brutal

campaign of

Israel and its violation of international law, Council resolutions

and the

peace accords''. 

<P>

Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France said the events of recent

days were

the

result of ''a deliberate provocation'' carried out by rightist

leader Ariel

Sharon. 

<P>

France, he said, condemned his actions and deplored the violence

that grew out

of his visit to the area of the Al Aksa Mosque on the Temple

Mount. That

visit,

he said, was done for reasons of domestic politics. 

<P>

Ambassador Hasmy Agam of Malaysia, who is the primary sponsor of

the NAM

resolution, said the world would never forget the image of the 12-

year-old

child being shot and killed in the arms of his father. 

<P>

Their fates summed up the plight of the Palestinians living in the

occupied

Arab territories: that of vulnerable people who were, from time to

time,

caught

haplessly in situations of violence and subjected to the draconian

policies

and

practices of the army of an occupying power. 

<P>

Malaysia also reaffirms the establishment of an independent state

of

Palestine,

with Al-Quds Al-Sharif, as its capital, along with the

implementation of all

international resolutions on the Palestinian issue, he added.

These were the

only guarantees for lasting peace between Israel and Palestine, he

noted.
