THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Demonstrators disrupted a major

conference on global warming Wednesday with dozens of protesters

staging a sit-in and a cake thrower targeting the top U.S.

negotiator.

<p>The uproar came as discussion at the U.N. climate conference

focused on how to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases,

blamed by much of the scientific community for global warming.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font>Key contentious issues include how far countries should be able

to use the carbon dioxide absorbed by forests and agricultural

lands against emission reductions targets and to what extent

nations should be able to buy their way into complying with their

targets.

<p>But the high-level talks were disrupted when several dozen

environmental activists entered the high security building, broke

into a committee meeting and staged a sit-in. Conference President

Jan Pronk said equipment was damaged and small fires were set in

the building.

<p>In an apparently unrelated incident, a woman pressed a chocolate

cream cake into the face of the chief U.S. negotiator, Under

Secretary of State Frank E. Loy as the American delegation gave its

daily press briefing. The woman then calmly walked out of the room.

<p>A second woman then stood up on a chair and screamed at the

delegates before being escorted out by a conference technician. Her

words were indecipherable. Conference officials said the identity

of the women were unknown.

<p>``On the eve of Thanksgiving, pumpkin pie would have been a more

traditional choice, but what I really want is a strong agreement to

fight global warming. I'm headed back to the negotiating table

right now with that aim,'' Loy said after the incident.

<p>He then excused himself and the briefing was called off.

<p>Environmental activists sitting outside the meeting room told

The Associated Press they sneaked into the building to disrupt

proceedings because they believed the goal of the meeting had

betrayed the spirit of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The protocol

committed the developing world to reduce their greenhouse gas

emissions by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels.

<p>The U.N. conference, which involves delegates from more than 180

countries, has two days left to decide how to reduce greenhouse gas

emissions, according to the Kyoto agreement.

<p>They environmental activists said they were not connected with

the women who disrupted Loy's briefing, nor with any environmental

organization.

<p>Dutch police said they had arrested around 100 protesters

Wednesday near The Hague's central train station. The activists

were planning to march to a number of embassies to protest against

nuclear energy, but did not have a permit.

<p>Protesters in the conference building said they believed the

negotiations were watering down environmental protection.

<p>Conferees are debating different ways that nations can use to

meet their emission reductions targets.

<p>One strategy includes the idea of international trading of

emissions credits, where countries who will have no trouble meeting

their goal could sell their surplus credits to those who are

struggling to meet the target. The United States wants unlimited

trading in credits.

<p>Another mechanism involves a voluntary compliance fund, where

parties can pay into a fund that will act as an agent to buy

foreign credits to help them meet their emissions targets.

<p>``They are woefully inadequate at addressing the issues,'' said

Kim Webster, one of the group's protesters from England. Webster

accused delegates of avoiding the ``real'' issues and called on

them to increase spending on renewable energy sources.

<p>``They need to stop talking about how to make money from climate

change,'' she said.
