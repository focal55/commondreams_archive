WASHINGTON  - Lawyers for victims of human rights

abuses committed

by the military regime in Burma claim that the Republican Party's

vice

presidential nominee was involved in a company that assisted in

energy

projects

in Burma associated with violent human rights abuses.

</TABLE></font>Until he was selected as vice presidential candidate for the

Republican

ticket,

Dick Cheney headed the energy giant Halliburton, which activists

say owned a

subsidiary which helped construct two pipelines that involved the

forcible

relocation of villages, forced labour, rape and murder. 

<P>

''Halliburton partners and subsidiaries, both before and during

Dick Cheney's

tenure as CEO, have been contractors for pipeline projects that

have led to

crimes against humanity in Burma,'' says Katie Redford, a human

rights lawyer

with EarthRights. 

<P>

The military government in Burma, also known as Myanmar, has long

been

considered one of the world's most abusive regimes. The United

States and the

European Union have imposed economic sanctions against the country

due to the

military's human rights abuses. 

<P>

The regime is holding Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whose

political

party swept national elections 10 years ago with more than 80

percent of the

vote, under house arrest. 

<P>

With western countries blocking substantial economic assistance

from the World

Bank and other multilateral financial institutions, the regime has

been forced

to rely on foreign investment in order to earn hard currency. 

<P>

Two such investment projects are the Yadana and Yetagun pipelines.

The 1.2

billion-dollar Yadana pipeline will pump natural gas from off-

shore fields in

the Andaman Sea through Burma to Thailand. Construction began in

1992 and was

completed last year. 

<P>

Lawyers with EarthRights have gathered testimony from more than

100 villagers

and several alleged army deserters who claimed to be victims or

witnesses of

abuses related to the army's security operations in the pipeline. 

<P>

Activists are demanding that the consortium operating the

pipeline, including

French oil giant Total, US-based Union Oil of California (Unocal),

and a Thai

state owned company, withdraw from the project and Burma

altogether. 

<P>

Redford and other lawyers for victims of human rights abuses

committed by the

military regime in Burma are appealing a Los Angeles judge's

recent ruling

that they cannot sue California-based Unocal which allegedly knew about

and

benefited directly from the regime's conduct. 

<P>

In the case, 'John Doe et al versus Unocal et al,' the lawyers

argued that the

company should be held liable for abuses committed by the army

which,

according

to their legal theory, acted as paid agents of Unocal and other

members of the

consortium. 

<P>

On Aug. 31, US District Judge Ronald Lew found that evidence had

been

presented

that Unocal knew or should have known about human rights abuses

committed in

connection with the project and that these acts benefited the

project.  

<P>

But, the judge concluded even if that were all proven in court,

the plaintiffs

would have to show that Unocal was much more involved. 

<P>

If the case proceeds, it could have major implications for recent

efforts by

the

United Nations and other international groups to promote codes of

conduct for

companies operating in developing countries. 

<P>

While activists appeal the ruling, Washington-based EarthRights is

now taking

aim at Halliburton whose subsidiary European Marine Contractors,

in a joint

venture with the Italian company Saipem, helped lay the offshore

portion of

the Yadana pipeline in 1996 and 1997, according to a new report by the

advocacy

group. 

<P>

Cheney was CEO of Halliburton during this time. Halliburton Energy

Services

also provided pre-commissioning services to the Yadana pipeline

with the help

of

the British company, Alfred McAlpine, according to the 42-page

report

released

here Wednesday. 

<P>

Human rights activists also connect Halliburton with a second

pipeline, the

Yetagun, which was constructed parallel to the Yadana pipeline.

EarthRights

claims that Bredero-Shaw, a subsidiary for Dresser Industries

manufactured

the

coating for the Yetagun pipeline in 1998. Dresser was purchased by

Halliburton

that same year. 

<P>

EarthRights has documentation that the Yetagun pipeline is

associated with

the

same pattern of human rights abuse as reported against the Yadana

pipeline.

''To be involved in the Yetagun project is to knowingly accept

brutal

violations of human rights as part of doing business,'' says

Redford. 

<P>

In response to criticism, last month Halliburton spokeswoman Wendy

Hall said

''we don't do business in Burma.'' 

<P>

Cheney announced early last month that he would forfeit some

options in

Halliburton if the Republican ticket is elected. He has already

sold a large

part of his holding in the energy company. 

<P>

EarthRights also outlines some of Halliburton's other activities

in Indonesia,

Iran, Iraq, Libya and Nigeria. 

<P>

One of the company's contracts with Indonesia was cancelled by the

government

during a purging of corruptly awarded contracts. An Indonesian

corporate

watchdog organisation called Halliburton's engineering division,

Kellogg Brown

and Root among 59 companies that used ''collusive, corruptive and

nepotistic

practices'' with former president Suharto's family, according to

EarthRights. 

<P>

In Nigeria, Halliburton was accused of complicity in the shooting  

of a 

protestor  

by Nigeria's Mobile Police Unit. 

<P>

EarthRights also documents Halliburton's strong involvement in USA- 

Engage and 

the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), two powerful industry  

groups that 

lobby against US sanctions. 

<P>

Last June, the Supreme Court sided with the NFTC which fought  

against the 

Massachusetts Burma law that prohibited state money from employing  

or 

contracting with companies that work in Burma. 

<P>

Pro-democracy Burmese groups and US human rights activists  

compared the 

selective purchasing law with those laws that helped bring down  

apartheid in 

South Africa in the 1980s.  

<P>

The NFTC argued that states should not be able to steer money away  

from Burma 

dictatorship because the federal government has already enacted  

sanction  

against Burma that pre-empt state laws. 

<P>

Dick Cheney signed an amicus brief against the Massachusetts law,  

according 

to  

the EarthRights report. Like Unocal corporate officers, he argued  

that 

sanctions do not work and that what is needed is so-called  

''constructive 

engagement' with  

governments accused of abuses. 

<P>

But Redford says the term constructive engagement is a smokescreen  

and what  

is really behind Halliburton's and the NFTC's agenda is commercial  

interests. 

<P>

''The real reason is they don't want to lose the business for  

themselves,'' 

she says.
