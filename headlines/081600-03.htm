BOGOTA, Colombia  - Colombian human rights groups have

rejected offers to take part in a U.S.-financed plan to fight drug

production, saying it envisions spending too much on the military

and not enough on social problems.

<p>A coalition of rights groups turned down U.S. appeals to support

President Andres Pastrana's ``Plan Colombia,'' which is being

partially funded with $1.3 billion in aid from the United States.

<p>U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said last week

that the anti-drug plan would rely on Colombian human rights and

other non-governmental organizations for advice on how to spend

millions in aid money.

<p>But representatives from 37 human rights and other

non-governmental organizations on Friday signed a statement in

which they rejected Pastrana's initiative.

<p>``We have ethical and political difficulties receiving aid from

this program,'' said Fernan Gonzalez, director of the Jesuit-run

Center for Investigations and Popular Education. ``Under these

conditions, we would not accept the resources the program will

provide.''

<p>The group's statement said the aid ``will not resolve Colombia's

drug problems'' because it assumes Colombia's ``national security

is based exclusively on a strategy to fight drugs and not on this

country's social and armed conflict.''

<p>The organizations faulted Plan Colombia because its total

projected $7.5 billion-budget earmarks a little less than $2

billion for social and economic development in areas where the

economy depends on cocaine production - not enough, they say.

<p>The statement came a week after about 100 elite U.S. troops

arrived in Colombia as part of the plan and began training an

anti-narcotics battalion near guerrilla territory.

<p>Most of the U.S. funds will go toward providing 60 combat

helicopters, which are to be used to ferry U.S.-trained troops into

drug-producing areas where leftist rebels and right-wing

paramilitary groups are active. The troops are to seize the areas

and allow planes to destroy drug crops by aerial spraying without

being shot down.

<p>The United States is also dedicating some $51 million to

strengthening Colombia's democracy and improve human rights, $13

million to improving Colombia's judicial system and $3 million to

further the peace process.

<p>European countries and international institutions are also

pledging to add more money for the plan, though the amount remains

to be determined.

<p>Jorge Rojas, director of the Consortium for Human Rights and the

Displaced, said Plan Colombia jeopardizes hopes that the Colombian

government and leftist guerrilla groups will reach an accord to end

a 36-year civil war.

<p>He said his organization would reject any money offered by

Washington as part of the plan.
