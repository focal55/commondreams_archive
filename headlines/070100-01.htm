OAKLAND, Calif., June 28 -- It 

was nearing 10 o'clock at night, but 

in the sweltering lecture hall that 

served as the stage for this political 

rally, the Green Party's nominee for 

president of the United States was 

still going strong.



<p>      He sharply criticized an "apartheid economy" that was benefiting 

only the rich, and he bemoaned the 

state of affairs in a country with "far 

more problems than it deserves and 

far more solutions than it applies." 

And he scoffed at the notion that he 

might be a spoiler, drawing enough 

votes away from Al Gore to tip the 

election to George W. Bush.

</TABLE></font></font>"You can't spoil a system," the 

candidate, Ralph Nader, said, "that's 

spoiled to the core."



<p>      The audience of 300 people or so 

loved it, repeatedly breaking into applause and giving the 66-year-old Mr. 

Nader a standing ovation coming in 

and heading out.



<p>      It is impossible to know whether, 

as current polls suggest, Nader's 

Raiders will have more impact on 

the race than the Buchanan Brigades 

of the likely Reform Party nominee, 

Patrick J. Buchanan. But one thing is 

clear on the campaign trail with Mr. 

Nader, the country's best-known consumer advocate: he is running an 

exceedingly more energetic race 

than he did four years ago, when he 

essentially stood in as a protest candidate, spending less than $5,000, 

speaking rarely and taking 1 percent 

of the vote.



<p>      "This is the difference between a 

person running and a person standing still," he said by way of comparison to his 1996 White House bid.



<p>  He has campaigned in every state 

this year -- flying commercial coach 

class, frequently using his senior-citizen's discount -- and appears 

well on his way to his goal of raising 

$5 million, with the help of the direct-mail network he has built over the 

years and plugs from several big 

Hollywood names.



<p>      He may wind up as a passing phenomenon in this campaign, like former Senator Bill Bradley or Senator 

John McCain. But for now, Mr. Nader is attracting a lot of attention -- 

among the news media, among left-leaning voters who see him as a 

more reliably liberal voice than Mr. 

Gore, and among leaders of organized labor, who agree with his stands 

on trade. Mr. Nader is a staunch 

critic of the North American Free 

Trade Agreement and the World 

Trade Organization, both of which he 

depicts as evidence of a "corporate 

globalization" that harms worker 

rights and the environment.



<p>      Polls in recent weeks have put him 

at 5 percent to 10 percent of the vote.



<p>      It would be a  stretch to call Mr. 

Nader a natural politician, and his 

one-and-three-quarter-hour nomination acceptance speech on Sunday in 

Denver may have been a tad long. 

But he seems highly animated, and 

 has a lot of sound bites down. He 

even claims to be enjoying his life as 

a politician, though he chooses a 

rather grim analogy to explain why.



<p>      "Oh, I have programmed myself 

so that if something is important to 

do, it's enjoyable," he said in an 

interview on Monday, after speaking 

at a women's center in the Mission 

District of San Francisco.



<p>      "I mean, there are some professional people who do that, too," Mr. 

Nader continued. "A good doctor, if 

he believes it's important to treat 

people, he'll enjoy treating people, 

even though outsiders may say, 'Oh, 

my God, what horrible tragedies and 

near misses, what pain you're dealing with.' "



<p>      In Mr. Nader's depiction, most of 

the country is in pain.



<p>  "At no time in our history have the 

children of America been in such 

crisis," he said in San Francisco the 

other day. And most wage earners, 

he told the crowd here, are working 

harder and longer than ever but have 

less purchasing power than they had 

in 1968.



<p>   Mr. Nader sees the West Coast -- 

with its mix of liberals, radicals, 

environmentalists and others who 

lean to the left -- as a fertile ground 

for his campaign. And indeed in California, where Mr. Nader has been 

involved in tort initiatives and has 

campaigned for so-called "patient 

protection" and H.M.O.-reform initiatives, polls show his support in the 

5 percent to 7 percent range.



<p>       Though the number is small, much 

of that support comes at the expense 

of Vice President Gore, who most 

analysts believe has to carry California to win in November. But even 

with Mr. Nader campaigning hard in 

the state, Democrats here profess to 

be little concerned about his impact.



<p>    Rather than reaching out to Mr. 

Nader and his backers, they have so 

far been dismissive.



<p>  "Ralph Nader is a 66-year-old Corvair in this race ready to be rear-ended," said Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the California Democratic Party. "This is the most serious vote of people's lives and they're 

not going to throw it away."



<p>  Mr. Mulholland said his  party 

would not "waste one ad" campaigning against the Green candidate.



<p>     "Nader became famous because 

of the Corvair and he's been doing 

college campuses ever since," he 

 said. "And now he wants to be president? It's a joke; it's ridiculous. Only 

in America can someone completely 

irrelevant run for president."



<p>     Politically, Mr. Nader's message 

is a bit complicated. He says that he 

hopes his candidacy will energize 

turnout for Democratic candidates 

in close races for the House of Representatives, and thus help turn power 

over to House Democratic leaders, 

and away from the Republicans in 

the House leadership whom he calls 

"beyond the pale."



<p>      But at the presidential level, Mr. 

Nader has nothing but venom for Mr. 

Gore and President Clinton, whom 

he accuses of offering "some of the 

most intensive demonstrations of political cowardliness in American  history." He says the race offers voters 

two "Republicrat" candidates, barely distinguishable.



<p>      "The only distinction between 

Bush and Gore is the velocity with 

which their knees hit the floor when 

big corporations knock on the door," 

Mr. Nader said the other day in Los 

Angeles, campaigning outside a public housing project.



<p>      A seasoned political strategist 

might suggest that while Mr. Nader 

remains so hot, he should be barnstorming the country. He did follow 

up his nomination acceptance in 

Denver with the swing here, and he 

said he plans many such swings. But 

afterward, he headed back to Washington, D.C., where aides said he 

planned to spend the rest of the week.



<p>      Here in Oakland, speaking on Monday at a downtown school called the 

University of Creation Spirituality, 

Mr. Nader elicited hisses of agreement from the crowd when he blasted several big-name Democrats in 

California, including Gov. Gray Davis and Senator Dianne Feinstein. 



<p>        Among the central planks of his 

campaign are  pledges to enact universal health insurance, to change 

labor laws to make it easier for 

unions to organize and to eliminate 

corporate welfare.



<p>      If there was any good news for Mr. 

Gore out of the rally here, it would 

seem to be that Mr. Nader's crowd 

was, by and large, so left-leaning that 

many voters there were not even the 

vice president's to lose. Several people in the audience said they had 

voted for Green or Libertarian Party 

candidates in the past.



<p>      What seemed to resonate with 

them most was Mr. Nader's "honesty -- just the sense that nobody is 

going to own him," as Corine Thornton, a 77-year-old retired waitress, 

put it. She voted for Mr. Nader four 

years ago, Ms. Thornton said, because "I just was  no longer satisfied 

with voting for the lesser of two 

evils."



<p>      Mateo Williford, a 28-year-old self-described "traveling activist," rejected the idea that a vote for Mr. 

Nader was a wasted vote.   

<p>"If we're 

ever going to have the possibility of 

three, four, five political parties," he 

said, "we have to make the choice to 

start bringing those in."



<p>      Still, some people were not even 

sure about the whole electoral effort 

on Mr. Nader's  behalf.



<p>      "I'm disappointed that all this energy is being put into the political 

system," said Jonah Zern, 22, a recent Cornell University graduate 

with a degree in environmental policy. "I mean, the idea that one person 

can represent 250 million people is 

absurd."



<p>      Mr. Nader is not without potential 

 vulnerabilities. Eyebrows were 

raised recently when the financial 

disclosure statements of Mr. Nader, 

America's most famous corporation-basher, revealed that he was worth 

nearly $4 million, in large part because of some savvy stock investments in high-technology companies.



<p>      Mr. Nader scoffed at the notion 

that there was anything untoward 

about reaping such gains. He said 

that he lived on about $25,000 a year, 

giving away 80 percent of his after-tax income, and that any of his gains 

represented a "de facto philanthropic fund" for his favorite causes.



<p>      No one really expects it, but what 

if Mr. Nader wound up in "that corporate prison we used to call the 

White House," as he describes it, 

dealing with the lawmakers "who 

have turned Capitol Hill into Withering Heights"?



<p>      Would he find it all daunting? Mr. 

Nader thought about the question for 

a while, and replied no:     "First of all, 

I've been in Washington too long, I've 

seen what kind of characters were in 

power, who should have been daunted but weren't."



<p>  So, no, 'daunting' was not  the right 

word.



<p>      "I would find it challenging to be 

president," he said. " 'Daunting' has 

almost a stuck-in-the-headlights, taken-aback sense, that maybe you're 

surprised by what you find yourself 

having to cope with. I don't think that 

would be the case."
