NEW DELHI  - India and Pakistan could still lose a

fight over

the ownership of 'Basmati' rice to a U.S.-based company, which has

been

forced to withdraw patent claims on the fragrant rice that has

been grown

for centuries in the central Indian Himalayan foothills. 

<P>

   Food security experts say celebrations by the Indian

government's

Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development

Authority

(APEDA), which filed for revocation of the patents granted in

September

1997 to 'Rice Tec' by the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO), may be

early.  

<P>

   ''We have succeeded in forcing Rice Tec to withdraw four out of

20

claims. The claims now withdrawn would have adversely affected

India's

commercial interests in future exports of Basmati rice,'' said an

APEDA

statement. 

<P>

   But leading food security activist Devinder Sharma argues that

by

withdrawing four of its crucial claims, Rice Tec has foiled

India's

attempts to strike down the patent. 

<P>

   According to Sharma, Rice Tec withdrew these because it

realised its

claims pertaining to 'novel rice grains' would not hold in the

light of the

re-examination sought by APEDA with the USPTO. 

<P>

   ''Of the 20 claims, only four are specific to the

characteristics of the

rice grain while the remaining 16 claims are more or less

concerned with

'novel rice lines', which details breeding techniques,

characteristics and

properties for cultivation outside the Indian sub-continent,'' he

says. 

<P>

    APEDA's strategy was to contest the claims made on novel rice

grains on

the premise that that the rest of Rice Tec's claims would then

automatically fall flat. But Rice Tec's lawyers, apparently

sensing the

strategy, deftly withdrew the clearly untenable claims.  

<P>

   ''Instead of celebrating and putting on a brave front in

public, APEDA

must quickly challenge the withdrawal and force the USPTO to

either accept

the entire patent application for re-examination or direct Rice

Tec to

withdraw its patent,'' says Sharma. 

<P>

   Rice Tec's claim on Basmati rice is said to be the most

audacious

instance of 'biopiracy' by Western transnational corporations

(TNCs). The

Indian government has successfully contested in the United States,

the

grant of a patent on the commercial use of the traditional

medicinal

properties of turmeric. 

<P>

   Another well-known example of biopiracy is the patent on the

herbicidal

properties of the 'neem' tree.  

<P>

   The Indian government was successful in the turmeric patent

case because

it could produce documented evidence, from ancient Indian texts,

showing

that turmeric's medicinal use was well known in the country for

centuries. 

<P>

   ''The Basmati case is tricky techno-legal business and once we

take up a

position we cannot easily withdraw it,'' explains Raghunath

Mashelkar,

director general of the Council of

Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).  

<P>

   But leading Indian anti-biopiracy campaigner, Vandana Shiva,

who

successfully challenged patents on neem granted to 'W.R. Grace' by

the

Munich-based European Patent office, accuses the government of

''lethargy,

indifference and collusion'' with Western interests. 

<P>

   According to Shiva, the Indian government is actually helping

biopirates. She has challenged in India's Supreme Court, a

biodiveristy law

enacted by Parliament last year, which allows TNCs exclusive

marketing

rights (EMRs) for traditional medicines that are used by the bulk

of the

one billion Indians. 

<P>

   ''The implication of the (biodiversity) bill is that the global

seed

industry can freely take seeds, claim patents or breeder's rights

by

tinkering with them and not be regulated,'' she explains. 

<P>

   In contesting the neem patents, Shiva too cited ancient texts

to show

that neem products have been used in India for centuries for

medicinal and

agricultural purposes. Earlier, the

Indian government lost its challenge to the neem patents in the

United States. 

<P>

   Pakistani anti-biopiracy campaigner, Uzma Jamil describes the

Basmati

and turmeric patents as ''manifestations of the increasing

infringement of

the economic and national sovereignty of the South by the North.''  

<P>

   According to Jamil, who is with the 'South Asia Commission on

Environmental, Economic and Social Policy, Rice Tec's claims are

clear

violations of the Convention on Biodiveristy (CBD), which

recognises the

sovereignty of a state over its natural genetic resources. 

<P>

''The manner in which Rice Tec established its patent,

demonstrates that it

has ignored the contributions of local communities in the

production of

Basmati and that it does not intend to share the benefits,'' says

Jamil. 

<P>

    Rice Tec's Basmati patent also violates provisions of the

Trade Related

Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement concerning

'geographical

indications', say anti-biopiracy activists. 

<P>

   Under this, for example, the term 'champagne' can only be used

to

describe wine that has been produced in the Champagne region of

France and

'Scotch' whisky can only be applied to the spirit produced in the

Scottish

highlands. 

<P>

   Basmati rice is also governed by this rule since it is has a

''closely

linked, exclusive relationship with its place of origin on the

Indian

sub-continent,'' says Sharma. 

<P>

   But, India has failed to claim TRIPs protection for Basmati

rice,

Darjeeling tea and other products, he says.
