JERUSALEM --        Dr. Khaled Qurie, the director of East Jerusalem's 

busiest hospital, opened the Kalfany Bonbons tin on his desk yesterday and 

offered one of the items inside to a visitor.	 



<P>  The small black ball, about the size of a Milk Dud, was not a sweet, but 

a rubber-coated steel pellet, one of several varieties of the projectiles 

Qurie has collected from his patients in the past few days.	 

</P>

<P>  In small clear storage jars atop Qurie's filing cabinet, he keeps ten 

more of the projectiles, used by the Israelis for riot control on the theory 

that they are less likely to be lethal than live ammunition. Some are 

spherical, some cylindrical, some sheathed in plastic, some covered in 

rubber. Each has a neatly lettered label specifying from whom, when, and 

from what part of the body it had been extracted.	 

</P>

<P>  ``The surprise was the high number of upper body injuries -- abdomen, 

chest, neck and head,'' he said, reviewing from memory the cases of the 35 

Palestinians who had been admitted to Makassed Hospital on Friday.	 

</P>

<P>  Most had serious wounds from the chaotic confrontation between Israeli 

police and Muslim worshipers outside Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. Six of 

the patients died, three of them hit by conventional bullets and three by 

the nonexploding rubber-coated projectiles.	 

</P>

<P>  An Israeli army spokesman, Maj. Yarden Vatikai, said such cases are 

unfortunate but unavoidable aberrations in armed clashes ``with hundreds and 

sometimes thousands of people,'' many of whom are lobbing stones and 

gasoline bombs at the troops. Israeli troops only fire live ammunition in 

response to incoming fire or ``when lives are threatened,'' he said.	 

</P>

<P>  But Qurie's collection is a prime exhibit in the case being made here by 

Palestinians and some Israelis, and internationally, that Israeli police 

have too readily employed deadly force in confrontations with Palestinian 

rioters in the past six days. Israeli soldiers are taught to fire the coated 

projectiles from specially adapted M-16s from at least 100 feet away and 

only at the feet and legs, army officers say.	 

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P> But there are many documented instances of close-range shootings at eye 

level. Since Friday, doctors at St. John's Eye Hospital in Jerusalem have 

treated 18 Palestinians who were shot in the eye with rubber projectiles, 

said Michael Cook, the chief executive there; most of the damaged eyes were 

left sightless, he said.	 

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P> Israel's critics are calling for an international inquest into the 

casualties. At least 51 Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have been killed in 

the clashes, including 13 children, as well as two Israeli officers and an 

Israeli civilian. And for the first time since peace talks led to the 

creation of the Palestinian Authority six years ago, Israelis have fired on 

civilians with helicopter gunships and armor-piercing missiles.	 

</P>

<P>  To the dismay of Israeli officials, the United States has joined in the 

</P>

<P>criticism. At the U.N. Security Council meeting in New York 

yesterday, the United States provisionally endorsed a draft statement 

condemning Israel for ``the acts of provocation, the violence, and the 

excessive use of deadly force against Palestinian civilians in the past few 

days.''	 

</P>

<P>  Many of the other 14 Security Council members, over unyielding American 

objections, pressed unsuccessfully for stronger language accusing Israel of 

violating the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which sets rules for the 

treatment of civilians by occupying military powers. The government of 

Israel contends it is not an occupying military power in East Jerusalem or 

the Palestinian territories under the terms of the convention.	 

</P>

<P>  Israeli officers acknowledged yesterday that their troops may have been 

responsible for killing 12-year-

old Mohammed Jamal Aldura in Gaza Saturday. His death has been universally 

acknowledged as both tragic and politically costly for the Israelis.	 

</P>

<P>  But some international critics found the killing of a Palestinian Red 

Crescent ambulance driver who was trying to come to the boy's aid equally 

disturbing.	 

</P>

<P>  In an unusual written protest, the International Committee of the Red Cross publicly "deplored" the driver's death and cited the obligations of military forces under the Fourth Geneva Convention to "respect and protect civilians and to apply the principle of proportionality whenever the use of force is required." 



<P>At least 18 Red Crescent ambulances have been hit by gunfire, said Uriel Masad, the International Red Cross spokesman in Israel. The Red Cross also condemned the 11 reported attacks in Palestinian areas on Israeli Magen David Adom ambulances.
