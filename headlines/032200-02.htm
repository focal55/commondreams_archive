<p>ATLANTA  --        Lisa Fair, a top executive in consulting firm 

Arthur Andersen's tax division, was pleased to learn that Georgia was 

rolling out a pioneering plan to provide free preschool to 4-year-olds from 

lower-income families. ``I feel like you should give each kid some equal 

opportunity,'' said the mother of three.	 

</P>

<P>  Her interest soared, though, when she learned a few years ago that the 

program was being expanded to all families, regardless of income, paid for 

with proceeds from a state lottery. Her daughter, Rachel, 4, now attends a 

free 6 1/2-hour program daily, where she has learned her ABCs, plays in the 

sandbox and does simple science experiments.	 

</P>

<P>  ``I'm really blown away,'' said Fair, 38, as Rachel and her classmates 

excitedly shouted out answers to questions about the stars and planets one 

day recently. ``I believe so much that this is the right answer to 

quick-start our educational system. We haven't done everything in Georgia we 

should -- by far -- but this program is so valuable.''	 

</P>

<P>  Georgia's ambitious undertaking -- more than 70 percent of the state's 

4-year-olds are now enrolled -- is but one indicator of the growing interest 

among states to offer extensive preschool programs to prepare youngsters for 

the demands of kindergarten and beyond.	 

</P>

<P>  The preschool movement is spreading across the country, much as the 

kindergarten concept caught fire in the United States at the turn of the 

century.	 

</P>

<P>  Forty-two states offer free or subsidized preschool, and enrollment has 

swelled to 750,000 children, according to a recent study by the Children's 

Defense Fund, an advocacy group. State spending on prekindergarten programs 

topped $1.5 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Health 

and Human Services, up from $180 million in 1987.	 

</P>

<P>  While many of these programs are designed for poor children, a few states 

are following Georgia's lead, opening them to all children, regardless of 

income or neighborhood.	 

</P>

<P>  Oklahoma and New York are among those starting to make preschool 

universal. New Jersey has the ambitious goal of enrolling 44,000 of its 

poorest children in preschools, and state officials say the program will 

continue to grow.	 

</P>

<P>  Connecticut is at the midpoint of a five-year ``school readiness'' plan 

that has enrolled 6,500 children in all-day programs so far; officials hope 

to include all 3- and 4-year-olds eventually.	 

</P>

<P>  Delaine Eastin, state superintendent of public instruction for 

California, has proposed spending $5 billion to offer preschool for the 

state's 1.1 million 3- and 4-year-olds.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Universal preschool is one of the most important things that our nation 

can do for our children,'' Eastin said. ``It will give them a firm 

foundation that allows them to be successful in school and, ultimately, in 

life.''	 

</P>

<P>  Optional preschool is on the table in several states, including Maryland, 

which already has a state-funded program for 11,000 low-income 4-year-olds. 

A coalition of legislators and state officials proposes to expand it to 

cover all 4-year-olds.	 

</P>

<P>  Supporters acknowledge little chance of approval for the $75 million 

initiative this year, but say they hope to spark discussion of the idea to 

gain support down the road.	 

</P>

<P>  Virginia has 6,100 children enrolled in a 5-year-old preschool initiative 

designed for at-risk children. The program, which costs about $18 million a 

year, takes place in Head Start centers, private schools and child care 

centers.	 

</P>

<P>  For years, the federal government has subsidized prekindergarten 

education for economically disadvantaged children through programs such as 

Head Start. But the funding covers only a portion of those eligible, and 

parents with moderate or above-average incomes have had to pay for private 

preschools or keep their children home until kindergarten.	 

</P>

<P>  Some studies suggest that disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds who 

participate in good preschool programs reap the benefits for years.	 

</P>

<P>  A study at the University of North Carolina that for two decades tracked 

disadvantaged children -- some who attended an intensive child care program 

and others from a regular program -- found that those in the former group 

were more likely to attend college, hold jobs and delay parenthood.	 

</P>

<P>  Another study, started in Michigan in the 1960s with 3-year-olds, 

obtained similar results.	 

</P>

<P>  The preschool issue has caught the attention of the presidential 

candidates. A cornerstone of Vice President Al Gore's campaign is a proposal 

to spend $50 billion on free preschool for all of the country's 4-year-olds. 

On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose state increased 

prekindergarten spending 30 percent in the 1990s to $235 million, has 

proposed revamping Head Start to emphasize academics.	 

</P>

<P>  Preschool programs are costly, as even their supporters admit. Thus far, 

only Georgia has a fully funded program for all 4-year-olds whose families 

want them to go.	 

</P>

<P>  Some critics say the programs force taxpayers to foot the bill for 

working parents to have free child care, while others point to research 

suggesting that benefits of preschool fade in a few years.	 

</P>

<P>  Darcy Olsen, director of education and child policy at the Cato 

Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, said most children do not 

need preschool.	 

</P>

<P>  ``I question the premise that there is an overwhelming unpreparedness -- 

that kids are spending the ages of 0 through 5 doing nothing, and then go 

through some sort of shock when they get to kindergarten,'' she said. ``I 

just don't see the evidence for that at all.''
