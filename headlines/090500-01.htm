WASHINGTON - The 

Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that had endorsed 

Bill Bradley in the Democratic 

primaries and seriously flirted 

with supporting Ralph Nader in 

the general election, has decided 

to endorse Vice President Al 

Gore, officials with the group 

said.



<p>      The endorsement, which will be 

announced in Oregon on Tuesday, 

provides another sign that Mr. 

Gore is moving swiftly to consolidate his support in the Democratic Party's liberal wing, much of 

which had balked at supporting 

him up until just a few weeks ago.



<p>      Friends of the Earth, considered the most left-leaning of the 

three national environmental 

groups that endorse candidates, 

has in the past sharply criticized 

Mr. Gore and the Clinton administration on a variety of issues, including their support for fewer 

restrictions on global trade and 

their failure to do enough to slow 

global warming.



<p>      Brent Blackwelder, president 

of Friends of the Earth, said in an 

interview on Sunday that the organization's political action committee had agonized over whether 

to support Mr. Nader, the Green 

Party candidate for president, because he shared their views on 

trade and many other major issues. By comparison, the group 

said in a statement,  it "knows the 

environmental disappointments 

with Gore."



<p>      But Dr. Blackwelder said the 

organization concluded that endorsing Mr. Nader would be tantamount to helping to elect Gov. 

George W. Bush, the Republican 

nominee. And he said that Mr. 

Gore's environmental positions 

were far better than those of Mr. 

Bush, which he asserted would 

"plunge us into a dark age" of 

environmental policy.



<p>      "We're looking at the reality 

here," he said. "In the United 

States, third parties do not get 

elected to the presidency."



<p>      In particular, Dr. Blackwelder 

asserted that Mr. Gore would 

spend more money on environmental programs, select more environmentally concerned judges 

for the federal bench and appoint 

more environmentally conscious 

administrators to federal agencies than Mr. Bush. 



<p>      Though Friends of the Earth is 

relatively small and has little 

money to invest in campaigns, it 

is potentially influential with liberal voters. Dr. Blackwelder said 

he and other leaders of his group 

would be traveling to swing states 

where Mr. Nader has been running strong, including Oregon, 

Washington, New Mexico and 

Michigan, to encourage potential 

Nader voters to support Mr. Gore. 



<p>      The League of Conservation 

Voters and the Sierra Club, the 

two other national environmental 

groups that publicly support national candidates, have already 

endorsed Mr. Gore.
