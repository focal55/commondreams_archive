WASHINGTON - The 

Democratic convention starting on 

Monday in Los Angeles will be a 

display of wealth, power and influence as gaudy as the Republican 

show in Philadelphia.



<p> Giving some of the most lavish 

parties will be Hollywood movie moguls, important Democratic sponsors at a time when the Democratic 

National Committee remains heavily 

dependent on its triad  of financial 

support: trial lawyers, trade unions 

and Hollywood.



<p> But the party has aggressively 

courted corporate support in recent 

years   and now counts securities 

firms, real estate investors, telecommunications   giants, software makers and insurance companies among 

its biggest donors. All will be well 

represented in Los Angeles at seven-figure fund-raising events for Democratic candidates and in the skyboxes ringing the Staples Center.



<p> The Democrats have even topped 

the Republican Regents, the elite 

club of $250,000 donors, with a big-dollar cadre of their own, a group of 

18 individuals and corporations 

called Leadership 2000 who have given or raised $350,000 or more. The 

club includes S. Daniel Abraham, 

chairman of Slim-Fast Foods; Peter 

G. Angelos, a trial lawyer and owner 

of the Baltimore Orioles; Peter L. 

Buttenwieser, a liberal Philadelphia 

philanthropist; and Louis Weisbach, 

a former high school football coach 

who is now a multimillionaire marketer of promotional products in 

Niles, Ill.



<p> In the 18 months ending June 30, 

the Democratic National Committee 

had collected $118.6 million in soft-money donations, the unregulated 

gifts from unions, corporations and 

wealthy individuals, nearly erasing 

the traditional Republican advantage in such contributions. The Republican National Committee reported $137 million in soft-money donations over the same period.



<p> The Democrats have raised nearly 

twice as much soft money in the 

current election season as they did at 

this point in 1996, when the party had 

collected $64.1 million. Most of the 

increase, however, is in the party's 

House and Senate campaign accounts, not at the Democratic National Committee, which has raised 

roughly the same amount as in 1996.



<p> While unions are 6 of the party's 10 

top donors, the bulk of the party's 

money is coming from  corporations 

and individuals who are motivated 

both by ideology and an impulse to 

put down a marker on what might be 

a winning ticket.



<p> "Right now the Republicans have 

been more successful with corporate 

money because they're in the lead in 

the presidential race and control the 

House," said Anthony Corrado, a 

campaign finance expert at Colby 

College in Maine. "But I would expect we will see more corporate contributions to the Democrats after the 

convention. When Gore tightens up 

the numbers in the polls and Democrats look like they have a chance to 

take the House, I expect to see corporations hedging their bets."



<p> Each of the three major sources of 

Democratic financing -- lawyers, 

unions and entertainment figures -- 

has increased its giving to the party 

over this point in 1996.   The three 

industries have provided nearly a 

quarter of all soft-money gifts to the 

Democratic National Committee so 

far this election cycle.



<p> The entertainment industry has 

given Democratic Party committees 

$5.8 million this year, compared with 

$5 million in 1996. Labor has contributed $11.3 million so far this year, 

compared with $9.28 million in 1996. 

The biggest increase is in gifts from 

lawyers and lobbyists, who have given the Democrats $11.6 million this 

year, compared with $8 million for 

the 1996 election cycle.



<p> Some of the individual trial lawyers who have donated the biggest 

sums to the Democrats were involved in class-action lawsuits 

against the tobacco industry and received windfall fees. Mr. Angelos, for 

instance, has demanded that the 

state of Maryland pay him more 

than $1.1 billion for his part in negotiating the state's $4.6 billion settlement with cigarette makers. He and 

his law firm have given the Democrats $700,000.



<p> Each constituency of the iron triangle has its reasons to be generous 

to  Democrats.



<p> Hollywood has generally supported the Democrats on social issues 

even as some Hollywood executives 

have expressed skittishness about 

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's condemnation of some movies, television shows and songs, but their jitters have not yet slowed donations. 

In fact, there will be dozens of Democratic fund-raising receptions in Hollywood  next week, including a post-convention party given by the chief 

of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein.



<p> Labor likewise is a longtime stalwart of Democratic politics. And 

while it has had its publicized fights 

with the Clinton administration, notably on trade, it remains ideologically attuned to the Clinton-Gore 

agenda. The administration has supported minimum-wage increases, 

middle-class tax breaks, expanded 

benefits for retirees under Medicare 

and increased spending on child care 

and preschool programs, all policies 

supported by the labor movement.



<p> Organized labor has been highly 

critical of Gov. George W. Bush's 

record in Texas on wages, labor 

rights, immigration, the environment and health care. Teachers 

unions, an important Democratic 

constituency, abhor Mr. Bush's support for school vouchers.



<p> And trial lawyers, put bluntly, despise Mr. Bush, who has made the 

trial bar a favorite whipping boy and 

has moved to limit awards in personal-injury and class-action lawsuits. 

The Clinton administration encouraged plaintiffs' lawyers to pursue 

multibillion-dollar lawsuits against 

cigarette companies which yielded 

huge fees to the lawyers. And Mr. 

Clinton won trial lawyers' undying 

devotion and financial support with 

his 1995 veto of a bill to curb shareholder lawsuits against companies 

with wildly fluctuating stock prices. 

Congress, in a rare act, overrode the 

president's veto, but the trial bar has 

not forgotten the president's act.



<p> Labor is doing more than it ever 

has to support the Democratic ticket, 

according to John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who provided a detailed account of labor's 

plans to help the Democratic ticket 

this fall. Contributions to Democratic 

committees, while significant, are 

but a fraction of the financial and 

shoe-leather efforts that unions are 

planning for the fall, he said.



<p> "The Republicans are going to 

spend more than ever because they 

want that house over there so badly," 

Mr. Sweeney said in an interview in 

his office overlooking Lafayette 

Park and the White House. "We can 

never match them dollar for dollar. 

But we have people power and an 

ability to communicate with people 

one-on-one. They have to try to buy 

that kind of voter contact."



<p> The A.F.L.-C.I.O. expects to spend 

about $48 million in the 2000 campaign, compared with about $35 million in 1996, union officials said. 

Much of the spending in the last 

election cycle was on television advertisements critical of Bob Dole, 

the Republican nominee.



<p> But this year the union is redirecting its efforts away from television 

toward organizing its members to 

get out the vote. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. 

and its member unions plan to put 

650 full-time workers on the street 

this fall, organizing every local, every factory and workplace, every 

shift to mobilize support and turn out 

union voters,  said Steve Rosenthal, 

the labor federation's political director.



<p> Other unions are planning independent expenditures as well. The 

American Federation of State, County and  Municipal Employees plans to 

spend roughly $3 million on outside 

efforts, including an advertising 

campaign sponsored by a union-created group, American Family 

Voices. The Service Employees International Union will spend as much 

as $5 million, in addition to its hefty 

contributions to Democratic committees and candidates.



<p> "These are the largest contributions that the American labor movement has ever made," said Gerald 

McEntee, president of the 1.3-million-member federation. "Everything is on the table -- the presidency, the leadership in the House and 

now the Senate -- and our members 

understand the stakes."



<p> The Democrats rewarded Mr. 

McEntee and Mr. Sweeney with 

prime-time speaking spots at the 

convention Tuesday and Wednesday 

evenings.



<p> Executives in the entertainment 

industry said that the relatively 

small increase in donations from 

Hollywood this year reflects two factors -- a certain complacency after 

controlling the White House for eight 

years, and a lower level of passion 

for Vice President Al Gore than for 

Mr. Clinton. Mr. Gore's selection of 

Senator Lieberman, an outspoken 

critic of the entertainment industry, 

as his vice-presidential choice has 

also dampened the ardor for the ticket in Tinseltown.



<p> "There's always a different level 

of enthusiasm when you're trying to 

get back something; 1992 was a different dynamic because we were trying to get back the White House after 

12 years," said Donna Bojarsky, a 

political adviser to several major 

Hollywood figures. "Then there's 

Clinton as a phenomenon out here 

that Gore just can't match. He'll 

have the money he needs, but the 

level of enthusiasm is different."



<p> The trial lawyers have been more 

generous in their giving to Democrats and more explicit in the reasons. Governor Bush has harshly 

criticized what he calls the greed of 

the trial bar and tried to limit their 

fees for winning multibillion-dollar 

settlements from the tobacco companies. Mr. Bush's support for tort law 

changes  and limits on settlements 

has made him anathema to plaintiffs' lawyers.



<p> "He has dedicated himself to gutting consumer rights," said Ron Motley, one of the nation's most feared 

trial lawyers and the bane of the 

tobacco industry. "He's for the pharmaceutical industry and the oil industry, and he's going to get a substantial amount of money from the 

tobacco companies."



<p> Senator Lieberman has advocated 

revision of tort law and limits on 

damages that plaintiffs can receive 

in damage suits, a position at variance with Mr. Gore's. Some trial 

lawyers have privately raised concerns about Mr. Lieberman's views, 

but for most plaintiffs' lawyers the 

Democratic ticket remains vastly 

preferable to the Republican alternative.



<p> "As a general rule, his record on 

civil justice issues has not been real 

strong," said Debbie D. Branson, 

chairwoman of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association. But she said Mr. 

Lieberman's presence on the ticket 

would not diminish trial lawyers' 

support for Mr. Gore.



<p> "We know what Gore's commitment is, and we certainly know what 

the Bush agenda is," Ms. Branson 

said. "We're quite confident that a 

Gore administration will support the 

civil justice system and protect 

American families."
