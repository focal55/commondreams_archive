San Francisco city officials yesterday took a bite-sized 

move toward rejecting genetically engineered foods by urging city 

purchasers to favor organic food vendors.	 

<P>  The Planning and Policy Committee of the city's Commission on the 

Environment unanimously passed an unusual resolution that urges all 

city departments to give preferential treatment to organic food 

vendors when the city awards catering contracts for special parties 

and events.	 

</P><P>  Caterers who avoid genetically engineered food -- known to its 

foes as ``Frankenfood'' -- would also get an advantage over 

competitors.	 

</P><P>  The resolution, which does not carry the force of law, is likely 

to pass the full Commission of the Environment, said President 

Randall Hayes. From there, it must get the approval of the city Board 

of Supervisors.	 

</P><P>  The measure won applause from Simon Harris of the Organic 

Consumers Association. He said scientific testing of engineered foods 

from the federal Food and Drug Administration has been lax, and the 

public could be exposed to unknown culinary dangers.	 

</P><P>  ``The primary goal of the U.S. government is to rush these foods 

to the supermarket shelves as quickly as possible with a minimum 

amount of testing,'' he said.	 

</P><P>  But one lobbyist from the grocery industry said the resolution was 

overcautious and could hinder the advancement of foods genetically 

altered to include vaccines and vitamins, creating products that can 

benefit poor countries.	 

</P><P>  ``Efforts like this take the technology a step backward,'' said 

Lance Hastings, of the Grocery Manufacturers of America.	 

</P><P>  The push to label genetically altered food in San Francisco is an 

outgrowth of a nascent drive to pass similar laws on the state level.	 

</P><P>  This April in Sacramento, the Senate agricultural committee 

rejected a proposal from Los Angeles Democratic Sen. Tom Hayden to 

require all grocery stores and restaurants in California to label 

products that had genetically modified ingredients.	 

</P><P>  Local representatives from Greenpeace helped shape the language of 

the proposed resolution, said commission member Parin Shah, adding 

that similar resolutions have been introduced in Santa Cruz, Berkeley 

and Boston.	 

</P><P>  In Berkeley, the school district has a policy-mandated goal of 

serving organic foods in its cafeterias.	 

</P><P>  San Francisco's resolution would call upon elected city officials 

to urge the federal government to label genetically engineered foods 

until they have been proved safe.
