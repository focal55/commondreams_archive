WASHINGTON -  Green Party presidential hopeful Ralph Nader picked up the endorsement of a big nurses' union in California, a state where his candidacy might have an impact on the general election.

<p>

The California Nurses Association, a 31,000-member union based in Oakland, praised Nader as committed to universal health care, patients' rights and expanded federal health insurance for Americans.

<p>

"He is the real thing, and he deserves the support of caregivers," Kay McVay, president of the association, said in a statement Wednesday.

<p>

Nader has been doing better than expected in some national polls, with some showing him at 4 to 5 percent in a statistical tie with Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan. But an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday indicated that including Buchanan and Nader in a four-way race did not alter the dynamics of the race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore significantly.

<p>

Nader, who has run for president several times in the past, earlier this month again selected American Indian activist Winona LaDuke as his vice presidential running mate.
