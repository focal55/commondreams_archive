WASHINGTON  - The spraying of chemical herbicides to

destroy coca

fields in southern Colombia could seriously threaten the

rainforests and

wildlife of the Amazon and the health of indigenous and small

farming

communities, warned scientists and indigenous leaders here. 

<P>

As part of a 1.6 billion dollar US emergency aid package to

Colombia, the

South

American country is preparing to undertake a large-scale

fumigation of

illicit coca plants using the herbicide glyphosate. 

<P>

Indigenous leaders, at a press conference here Monday, said the

use of

glyphosate, manufactured by the US-based company Monsanto, is not

stopping

coca from being grown. Instead, it is killing their food crops and

causing a

series of health problems and water contamination. 

<P>

''The fumigation has caused damage to our yuca and sugarcane crops

and has

caused sickness in our children,'' said Francisco Tenorio,

president of the

Regional Indigenous Organisation of Putumayo, a region in

Colombia. 

<P>

In Putumayo and other regions, including Guaviare, Meta and

Caqueta,

communities have reported that indiscriminate fumigation has

caused illnesses,

destroyed pastures and food crops, poisoned livestock and

contaminated water

supplies, he said. 

<P>

Emperatriz Cahuache, president of the Organisation of Indigenous

Peoples

of the Colombian Amazon, displayed a map illustrating how the

areas of coca

and marijuana cultivation overlaps with indigenous territories and

the areas

that have been fumigated. 

<P>

''These fumigations are contaminating the Amazon and destroying

the forest,''

said Cahuache. 

<P>

Photos taken in Colombia displayed at the press conference showed

food crops

destroyed by fumigation along side thriving coca plants that

somehow escaped

the herbicide. 

<P>

While supporters of the aerial spraying say glyphosate is no more

harmful than

table salt, Elsa Nivia, director of the Colombian affiliate of the

Pesticide

Action Network, an environmental advocacy group, said the

herbicide is

''toxic'' to all plants. 

<P>

''It is impossible to say that this herbicide can be applied in a

way that is

not harmful to the environment,'' she said. 

<P>

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency's own

study on the

herbicide published in 1993 noted that in California, a state that

is required

to report pesticide poisonings, glyphosate was ranked third out of

the 25

leading causes of illness or injury due to pesticides. 

<P>

Labels on glyphosate products in the United States advise users to

avoid

applying it to any body of water. 

<P>

Nivia warned that the ecological impacts of the pesticide in the

Amazon is not

completely known since it has not been tested in a tropical

ecosystem.. 

<P>

David Olson, director of the conservation science programme at the

World

Wildlife Fund (WWF), compared the effects of spraying glyphosate

in Colombia

with the use of Agent Orange during the US war with Vietnam. 

<P>

He said both caused large areas of forest to be contaminated and

stripped of

their leaves, causing a loss of habitat for species and increased

fragmentation

of intact forests. 

<P>

''From a global bio-diversity perspective, defoliating and

poisoning vast

areas

of Colombian forests is like dynamiting the Taj Mahal, a global

jewel of

humanity's cultural heritage,'' said Olsen. 

<P>

Aquatic ecosystems are particularly sensitive to glyphosate and

wildlife,

especially frogs and insects will be directly affected, he said.  

<P>

''Many will die from contact with the spray,'' he said. ''The loss

of habitat,

foods, shelter, moisture and soil nutrients will affect all

species.'' 

<P>

The survival of Colombia's abundant bird species is also at risk

from the

fumigation, according to Luis Naranjo, director of international

programmes

at the American Bird Conservancy, a US advocacy group. 

<P>

He said a recent scientific study of a part of Putumayo, confirmed

that about

500 bird species were living in the region that is now the main

target of the

drug eradication campaign. 

<P>

''Unless the current policies to face the drug problem in the

country are

revised, we will be facing the extinction of many of the organisms

that make

the country's biota so distinctive,'' said Naranjo. 

<P>

Human rights activists and Colombian drug policy analysts at the

press

conference said there is strong evidence that aerial fumigation

and other

source control efforts are ineffective at curbing overall drug

production and

reducing drug use in the United States. 

<P>

Even though the Colombian government fumigated coca and poppy from

1992

to 1999, the country remains the world's leading producer of coca,

said

Ricardo Vargas, a sociologist with Accion Andina, a Colombian-

based

organisation that researches the impact of counter-narcotics

policies.. 

<P>

''Despite these realities, Colombia is preparing to repeat yet

again a

policy that has failed repeatedly,'' he said. 

<P>

Sanho Tree, director of the drug policy project with the Institute

for

Policy Studies, criticised the focus on drug eradication,

interdiction and law

enforcement. 

<P>

He pointed to a study by the RAND Corporation, a California-based

think-tank,

which found that dollar for dollar, providing drug treatment to

cocaine

users in the United States is 10 times more effective than drug

interdiction

programmes and 23 times more cost effective than trying to

eradicate coca at

its source. 

<P>

''If decreasing drug use is our ultimate goal, why aren't we

putting more

resources into our woefully under-funded domestic drug treatment

programmes

where each dollar spent is 23 times more effective?'' asked Tree.
