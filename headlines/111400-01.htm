NEW YORK -  Complaints continue to mount from African-

Americans

around the country who say they were prevented from voting or that

they

observed serious irregularities in last week's poll for the

nation's highest

office.

<P>

Among the obstacles reported were registration challenges,

intimidation,

misleading information, police profiling near predominately Black

polling

stations and ballot tampering.  

<P>

''The system is not working for us - again,'' said Florida

Congresswoman

Carrie

Meek, who added in a published report that she personally was

aware of

hundreds

of complaints from black voters.  

<P>

Reports of alleged voter fraud continue to emerge as well from

Florida

counties, now in the international limelight, including reports

from two

African-American weekly papers.  

<P>

In Fort Myers, Florida, Charles Weaver, publisher of the Community

Voice,

said:

''In Republican Country, (I) received at least a dozen calls from

people with

all kinds of apparent 'voting inequities.'''  

<P>

Visiting one of the polls himself, he said he witnessed

''intimidation,

harassment and apparent illegal activity'' at the precinct.  

<P>

''There were illegal poll watchers, threatening people, telling

them, 'I know

where you work. You're going to get fired.'''  

<P>

''One guy who lost his wallet was not allowed to vote because he

had no

identification - rather than asking him to sign a document stating

his

identification as (is legally) required,'' Weaver said.  

<P>

At another African-American weekly, Miami Times, Tonnette Collier,

a reporter,

said her newspaper got so many calls that she lost count. ''There

were a

lot of

elderly people. They were very upset,'' she said. ''It's so much

confusion,

it's unbelievable.''  

<P>

Many callers told of a police check point that was stopping cars

on a road

that

leads to the First Baptist Church of Woodville in Tallahassee,

Collier said.  

<P>

Major Ken Howes of the Tallahassee Highway Patrol confirmed that

his

department

did conduct what he called a ''routine'' check point on Oakridge

Road about

''2.1 miles'' from the precinct. He said the check, ''one of 31

that been

conducted in the last 30 days in this area,'' had nothing to do

with voting or

elections, but was to enforce laws pertaining to licenses,

insurance and faulty equipment on cars.  

<P>

Similar troubles were reported by Anita Hodgkiss, senior attorney

at The

Advancement Project and a former voting rights lawyer with the US

Justice

Department.  

<P>

Hodgkiss volunteered to work with other lawyers on a telephone

hotline taking

calls on direct intimidation or obstruction of potential voters.

'Apparently,

police in Newport News, VA were stopping people at checkpoints,''

she says.

''In St. Louis, Missouri, some voters there were turned away for

not having

their cards, while their White counterparts were allowed to vote.  

<P>

''We also got a lot of calls from ex-felons who wanted to vote,

but couldn't.

The good thing is that they were (calling from) states where they

could vote.

In Florida now, there is a legal challenge pending to the

disenfranchisement of

ex-offenders.''  

<P>

A statement released by the human rights group Human Rights Watch

noted that

Florida, being one of over a dozen states that denies the right to

vote to

ex-offenders, kept 400,000 (black and white) individuals out of

the election

booths. One third of African-American men in that state, or

200,000, cannot

vote because of a past felony arrest.  

<P>

Nationally, one in 50 adults, or nearly 4 million US citizens

cannot vote

because of felony records, and 1.4 million of them have completed

their

sentences and are not on probation or parole.  

<P>

In a 1998 report, the human rights group estimated that 30-40

percent of the

next generation of African-American men may be disenfranchised

because of

criminal records.  

<P>

Meanwhile, the nation's largest black civil rights group, the

NAACP (National

Association for the Advancement of Colored People), has asked

Attorney General

Janet Reno to investigate possible violations of constitutional

guarantees of

the right to vote.  

<P>

''On the surface, there appears to be a violation of the 15th

Amendment, which

guarantees minority voters the right to vote for the candidate of

their

choice,'' said Julian Bond, NAACP chairman, in a published report.  

<P>

The voter fraud allegations, said NAACP president Kweisi Mfume,

''raise

serious

questions about the fairness and accuracy of the election ... Our

sense is

that

the level and number of calls we received suggest very serious

problems,

perhaps even nationwide''.
