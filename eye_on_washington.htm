    By Craig Brown<br>
    Executive Director<br>
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/">Common Dreams</a></font> 
<p><font face="Georgia"><big><big><big>I</big></big></big>t&#146;s
    been said that dreams are our roadmap to the future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">If so, just where is our country heading?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Consider the cynical, short-sighted, poll-driven promises made in
    the recent presidential election: Impose strict curfews on our kids. Mandate school
    uniforms. Solve crime by building more prisons. Put V-chips in TV sets. Slash investments
    in our future. Privatize public services.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">A vision for America&#146;s future? The &quot;Bridge to the 21<sup>st</sup>
    century&quot;? Hardly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">I watched the 1996 presidential campaign feeling cheated. Where
    was the debate on the real issues of our day? Where were the competing visions that we
    could examine and choose among? Where were the bold, inspiring ideas to rally Americans to
    work together for a brighter future?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">It&#146;s no wonder 52% of American voters chose &quot;None of the
    Above&quot; by staying home last November.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">How ironic. It was just a few years ago that our Great American
    Democracy was the beacon of inspiration to the young people tearing down the Berlin wall
    and facing down tanks in Tiananmen Square. Now, while counties such as Greece and Italy
    have voter turnouts approaching 90%, we set dismal new records for no-shows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Our democracy is in deep trouble. Have Americans really become so
    disgusted with Washington, so cynical about our politics that we are ready to give up?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">My generation grew up believing that America was special. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">As a teenager in the 1960&#146;s, I first thought of public
    service through the words of Bobby Kennedy. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us to work for
    social justice. Each of us could make a difference, all of us should try. &quot;Ask not
    what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">What a different message kids coming of age in the 80&#146;s and
    90&#146;s have heard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Ronald Reagan, in his first Inaugural speech, said that not only
    was government incapable of solving our problems, but that government was, itself, the
    problem with America.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Talk radio&#146;s message of &quot;me-first-ism&quot; has been
    blaring for years. The marketplace is god. The doctrine of the bottom-line. Survival of
    the fittest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">At a recent Capitol Hill reception, hundreds of young
    Congressional staffers and interns filled a standing-room-only hall to hear and meet their
    new icon. A bold, young Senator or Congresswoman? A visiting world leader? No. They
    cheered and sought autographs from political consultant Dick Morris -- the cynical
    mastermind of the Clinton/Gore reelection campaign.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">I spent four years in Washington as Chief of Staff to former Maine
    Congressman Tom Andrews. My friends back home would often ask me if things in Washington
    were really as bad as they seemed. &quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;it's worse than we
    thought. Much worse.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">In 1917 Republican President Teddy Roosevelt warned that unchecked
    capitalism would destroy America.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Our national leadership, Democrats and Republicans alike, have
    understood that democracy and capitalism exist together in an uneasy alliance. Pure
    capitalism -- left alone by the state -- would lead to an unjust society with a few big
    winners and many losers. Capitalism too tightly constrained by the state would choke and
    fail. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Over the past 60 years, Presidents and Congress -- usually prodded
    by grassroots pressure -- have built a legislative framework of programs and laws to
    protect the common good against the excesses of capitalism. The result: a thriving
    American middle-class.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">But something has gone wrong. And that framework is being
    dismantled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">The balance between our democracy and capitalism is seriously out
    of whack. While the stock market soars to new heights, our democracy has fallen to new
    lows. While the gap between the haves and have-nots has widened, the middle-class is
    squeezed ever tighter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Politicians like to say that government should be run more like a
    business. Americans, perhaps thinking of thrifty hometown mom-and-pop small businesses,
    nodded in a collective &quot;Amen.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Unfortunately, the Washington of today took its cue not from a
    1950&#146;s community-based small business but rather a 1990&#146;s-style corporate
    raider. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Like the absentee corporate managers who care only about the
    bottom line in the next earnings report, our political system looks no further than
    yesterday&#146;s poll and the next election cycle. Cut back on investments in the future
    in order to make the short-term ledger/next election look a little better. Put off the big
    problems for someone down the road to clean up. Slash benefits to the workers while the
    CEO&#146;s get massive bonuses. Corporations pollute our air with toxic emissions;
    politicians pollute our airwaves with toxic &quot;wedge issues.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Washington is awash in money. There are 90,000 lobbyists and
    60,000 lawyers working the system for the benefit of their clients. Former Senators George
    Mitchell and Bob Dole -- like so many others -- join forces to lobby their former
    colleagues for the tobacco industry and Chilean salmon farmers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">It&#146;s pretty clear why short-term politics beats out the
    long-term common good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">What shall we do?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">We could curse the darkness. We could retreat into a cynical
    apathy and join the majority who sat out the last election. Or we could choose optimism
    and be part of the solution. Indeed, those Americans who still maintain a democratic faith
    have a patriotic duty to come to the aid of our American democracy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Those of us who grew up in New England know the rich tradition of
    shared town commons. The sense of community when neighbors pitch in to help one another
    get through hard times. The civil give-and-take of our town meetings. We know that
    government is not our enemy. Probably more than in most parts of America, we New
    Englanders agree with these words of Teddy Roosevelt, spoken 1902, &quot;The government is
    us; we are the government, you and I.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Common Dreams is a new national grassroots organization created to
    work to renew and reinvigorate America&#146;s democratic vision.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">We believe that it is time to have a new national dialogue on just
    what it means to be an American today and for the future. What common dreams do we share
    for ourselves and our kids? What obstacles stand in the way of achieving our dreams? What
    kind of example do we want to set for emerging democracies around the world?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">We believe that we have a unique and powerful opportunity to
    challenge the cynicism that symbolized the 1996 elections. An opportunity to rediscover
    what it means to be part of a national community. A chance to show that working for the
    common good, and not only for oneself, is the key to a better future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Election year 2000. A new century. A new millenium.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">We are a society that holds sacred the milestones of the passing
    of time &#150; birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and decades &#150; each an opportunity
    to pause and reflect on our past, our current condition and, our future. A time to reflect
    -- individually and collectively<i> </i>-- on opportunities lost. And dream of fresh
    starts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Common Dreams mission is to organize an open, honest and
    nonpartisan national discussion leading up to the Election Day 2000. At the national
    level, and in communities throughout every congressional district, we will work to breathe
    life into our common dreams.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">America is at a crossroads.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia">Will we continue down the path of cynical and shortsighted
    policies? A path that plays to our fears and divides our communities? Or, will we begin
    organizing Americans to think big and use our national imagination to create a roadmap for
    a better future?</font></p>
