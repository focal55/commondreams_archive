<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As with every tragedy, I try to find the good that can come of it. In the case of the world trade towers, It came in the form of Howard Lutnick the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. His company was literally on top of the world. They were housed on the top floors of the tallest building in a city considered to be the center of trade for the world. He was the apex of the most profitable company in that building. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  I watched him being interviewed on world news, as he broke down in tears. Here was a very wealthy man who had everything a person could wish for. Numbers were his life, 700 employees were lost in the blink of an eye. He no longer sat at the top of the world, he no longer had 700 employees, and all his wealth no longer mattered, the bottom line seemed so unimportant. He had what some might call an epiphany. He made the statement that he and his four surviving employees were going to rebuild the business. However this time he would do it differently. He vowed that he was going to put emphasis on taking care of the people that work for him. Why do you suppose he made this statement, I believe he had come to realize that a business cannot function without people, let alone become profitable. I truly hope he lives up to this noble promise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  In these times of corporate cutbacks and bottom lines I have watched as companies have forgotten about the human element. It has been a generation since companies have shown loyalty to their employees, which in turn has caused employees not to show any loyalty in return. There is no such thing as a career employee anymore. By the time an employee learns how to do their job, they are let go, so that a company does not have to pay higher wages and benefits. Or the employee moves on to another company that might offer better wages. Many companies have gone to using part time employees, why, its considered more profitable to have two employees that work less than forty hours a week with low wages and no benefits rather than have one person earning higher wages and receiving benefits. Companies have many ways of increasing the bottom line, another such way is to cut staffing all the while increasing their workload. If they do not perform, they are simply let go. Hey there are always some other eager beavers waiting in line to be chewed up and spit out. As a result of this CEO bottom line thinking, American workers are perceived as lazy and uncaring. Products and services in this country have taken a back seat to the bottom line. This typical CEO mentality has infiltrated into all aspects of our lives. CEO politicians are starting to do the same in state and federal governments,who will suffer as the result. Do you suppose the President may be rethinking some of his cutback thinking now, there are some Governors that have been doing the same to their states as well, look at Florida as an example. A Company or a government is only as good as the people who do the work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  Yes, this was a very tragic event, unfortunately it often takes tragedies to bring about change. I am one American that prays that other CEO&#146;s and CEO politicians take stock of the people that work for them. Thank you Cantor Fitzgerald for realizing the importance of the people that work for you. With this new found philosophy I believe that your company will come back stronger than the steel and concrete that used to house your company.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jane and I went to the Unitarian Universalist Church in Palo Alto on Sunday morning and had to sit in folding chairs in the lobby, where the overflow had spilled. People stood along the walls of the chapel and the lobby throughout the service. Apparently about a third of those in attendance were visitors like us, not regular members.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Early in the service one of the ministers called for all the elementary-school-aged children - and there were many - to come forward and gather near the front of the chapel. From where we sat we couldn't see how many went forward, but we could see that most of the children near us responded to that call by clutching their parents more tightly, and by burying their heads in their mothers' laps, just as I would have done when I was a child, and as our kids would probably have done at that age. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Curiously and wonderfully though, a little later when another invitation went out to the children to come to an adjacent room to work on a quilt, &quot;to help those who are sad,&quot; every child got up out of his or her fear and went forward.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of us are like that, aren't we? Our impulse to help is so profound that it often feels like a primal biological need.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apparently the Red Cross and other relief agencies in New York are having to turn away help, so overwhelming is the tide of love and caring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Out of the depths of unfathomable evil and pain come acts of incredible heroism and love. There are so many stories. We heard about a man at the World Trade Center, now lost, who wouldn't leave the side of his paraplegic friend.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are opened up and we see the best and worst at once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's curious, isn't it, that both of these forces - the best and the worst - seem to come forth most often when our &quot;tribe&quot; is attacked and wounded? Surely this is why we want to hang out our flags. It was the American tribe that was attacked. Our tribe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently I heard the Middle East described as, not nations, but rather &quot;tribes with flags.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm not using the word, &quot;tribe,&quot; as a pejorative ... not any longer.  It really *is* our nature. We evolved in tribes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For much of my adult life I scoffed at that tribal impulse. I associated it with ignorance and narrowness. I wanted to believe I was above that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This particular arrogance - along with most other impulses that separated me from my tribe - got blasted into oblivion last Tuesday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe the best hope for humans on planet Earth right now is not to reject our tribal nature, but rather to fully accept it, and work, as my friend Sunia says, &quot;to make the 'we' bigger.&quot; This means, not leaving the tribe, but making the tribe bigger. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A way to begin this process is just to be more conscious. When we feel those noble and legitimate impulses - patriotism, care and love - we should remember that all members of all tribes everywhere feel them just as keenly and just as legitimately as we do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe an ironic and unexpected side-effect of today's transformation to economic globalization will be an enlarging of the &quot;We.&quot; That thought occurred to me when a colleague sent me the following very touching photos from around the world, citizens of many countries grieving *with* us:<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blood lust has been unleashed.  The corporate media, the opportunistic

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People who have been so angry and frightened by policies that have eroded
their jobs, wages, medical coverage, environment, communities, schools,
freedoms and futures, now have a target to vent on.  Reeling under the

inflation of the currency; the second is war.  Both bring a temporary

War I and II up close and personal.</font></p>

will be revealed as the myths they truly were, and slavery unmasked for the
reality it has always been.</font></p>

Why do Americans assume the recent attack on the World Trade Center and 
Pentagon was committed by Muslims?  Presumably because Americans assume 
Muslims have reason to bear a grudge against the American people for all 
the pain the government of the United States has visited upon the people of 
Islam.  In this there is hope for a compassionate change in the current 
policy of the United States, the policy which has brought so much suffering

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm usually sympathetic to progressive causes and 
believe that Americans tend to turn a blind eye 
to the destructive effects of corporate 
imperialism around the world.  Yet I find myself 
unnerved by the dogmatic overtones of the 
progressive response to the events of September 
11.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I too would abhor civilian casualties abroad at 
the hands of the U.S. military if these resulted 
from an ineffectual jingoistic response to these 
attacks to appease a vengeful electorate.  But if 
putting that kind of pressure on the governments 
of, for example, Afghanistan or Iraq, could force 
their hand, expose their complicity in support of 
anti-American terrorist networks, and flush out 
these networks' members, I have a tough time 
opposing the viability of military action.  I am 
open to any solution that will ensure I don't 
wake up in New York one morning to find an 
anthrax cloud blowing into Brooklyn.  I'm not so 
sure some of the avowed pacificts on this board 
are, and that troubles me.  Yes, a violent 
response might just inflame the passions of 
disaffected bystanders and breed a new terrorist 
generation.  At the same time, appeasement may 
very well encourage militants to even bolder 
attacks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Americans know from confrontations with the 
far right on their own soil, fundamentalists 
subscribe to a rigid absolutism that willfully 
refuses to respond to reasoned argument.  At this 
late date, copping to America's foreign policy 
debacles in the Middle East seems very unlikely 
to soften the tempers of the Mujihadeen.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I stood at the corner of West Broadway and Duane 
St. in Tribeca when the first WTC tower 
collapsed -- outside the blast radius but close 
enough to feel the earth shake -- a bold, animal, 
palpable manifestation of hate.  In a time of 
such profound insecurity, you may feel tempted to 
seek solace in cherished, time-tested beliefs.  
Have the courage to start over -- admit your 
uncertainty, your lack of expertise -- to 
acknowledge that you may have to reassess the 
premises of your understanding of your place in a 
world with few places left to run to.  Don't let 
yourself become a victim of the fundamentalist 
Left (it does exist) just to salvage your sense 
of self from the ideological wreckage.  You 
aren't who you thought you were anymore. </font></p>

It is without argument we need Middle East intervention to snag Osama bin Laden and his boys; or do we want to repeat the Russian version of Viet Nam in Afghanistan?  In just two day's research, I found reasons for the hatred of us.  Bill Clinton's less-than-successful bombing, followed by bail-out from long term commitment.  While reasons were found, there will never be justification for the carnage on Tuesday.  Their's is a culture foreign to us.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I awaken to another glorious Maine autumn day.  Sparkling sun.  Deep blue cloudless sky.  I can't wait to get out into the woods for my early morning walk.  How fortunate I am to live in rural Maine, and have access to a beautiful forest.   All by myself.   No one else around except the critters going about their early morning business.<br>
 <br>
What will my business be today, Monday September 17?  Here' some of my to-do list:  <br>
 <br>
I will glance of my tattered Earth flag, faded and worn from so many summers on the flagpole.  (Its time to invest in a new one.)<br>
 <br>
I will water the beautiful red geraniums in the whiskey barrel out under the mailbox.  (The whiskey barrel that just sprouted a small American flag over the weekend thanks to a friend.)<br>
 <br>
I will secure the Peace candle (aka Christmas candle) to the window sill on the second floor, making sure it stays lit for all who pass the house to see. <br>
 <br>
I will figure out a way to wear an old Peace pendant I dug out of the attic over the weekend.<br>
 <br>
I will re-registered for the Earth Charter Symposium postponed from this upcoming weekend, now scheduled for early spring.<br>
 <br>
I will call to thank a friend who had the wits about him to quickly organize a peace and tolerance rally in Portland last Wednesday.<br>
 <br>
I will send money to the Red Cross, Salvation Army and the Firefighters Relief Fund.<br>
 <br>
I will keep my scheduled appointment this afternoon with friends from Maine Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Maine Council of Churches.  Agenda:  to plan global warming strategy and legislation for the upcoming state legislative session.<br>
 <br>
I will call my environmental activist friends in D.C. to tell them I and others in Maine are beginning again to move onward and upward. <br>
 <br>
Peace.</font></p>

I put a peace sign flag on my garage.  A simple white sheet with a blue 
spray painted on peace sign.  A pizza pan served as a good model for a 
circle.  I am sickened by the mass hysteria and patriotism.  The American 
flag has become a symbol of it, chest beating and trigger happy people 
wanting revenge.  I want to be the voice of peace and not only the one in 
Madison doing this, so pass this on to people all over the US/world. The 
voices of dissent have been silenced, I have not once heard on major 
networks anything about the causes of why this happened - our treatment of 
Iraq and the Palestinians, which inflamed Bin Laden, our training him to 
fight the Soviets.  The US is complicit in these attacks due to our 
misguided foreign policy.  Our hands are bloody as well.  I pray for the 
families and for the victims and also pray for the &quot;collateral damage&quot; 
(e.g. more civilians) who will suffer from our bombings, which at this 
point seem likely.  </font></td>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think it goes without saying that nations, including the United States, have the right to defend themselves when they come under attack.  But that doesn't relieve their leaders of the obligation to exercise some intelligence and to avoid recklessly endangering the lives of their own citizens, and it certainly doesn't confer any special rights to kill other innocent civilians who happen to live in countries targeted for counterattack.  It's not enough that a response appear to be &quot;justified&quot; and in keeping with the terms of a broad national consensus (easy standards to meet given the enormity of the carnage and the natural impulse to strike back).  Setting aside for the moment issues of proportionality, international law, past and current US military intervention and support for various repressive foreign regimes, the US response must also meet the test of actually, and not just apparently, promoting the public safety of the  American people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's what I expect will happen in the weeks and months ahead:  more resources (after a shake-up) for the FBI and the CIA; greater isolation (if that's possible) of the Palestinians; increased defense spending; funding for Star Wars; strengthening of the sanctions against Iraq (how many dead children so far?); renewed support for police &quot;profiling&quot;; stepped-up involvement in Colombia; black ops vs. Danny Ortega's presidential campaign in Nicaragua (the polls have him in a dead heat); the killing of Osama bin Laden; and major military counterattacks against targets in Afghanistan and Iraq. Will this make the world safer for American citizens?  Somehow I doubt it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any response purporting to promote the safety of the American public that does not include a serious re-examination of US foreign policy, particularly in the Mideast, is grossly inadequate and will, in all likelihood,  place American lives in even greater jeopardy in the future.  Forget about the propaganda. We are not just dealing with a small handful of madmen in the pay of evil monsters who can simply be identified, hunted down and eliminated.  Unless we address the conditions that have given rise to the hatred and desperation on display this past week, airstrikes and assassinations and invasions will just set the stage for the next round of suicide attacks on the United States and its allies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How ironic that the Right wing governments who call for tax cuts, less public spending, low minimum wages, cut this, cut that, and the slavish devotion to the bottom line is what  led to lax airport security that allowed the suicidal terrorists to board those jetliners in the first place. How about the punitive sanctions against countries such as Iraq that have killed un-told numbers of children( who must surely be classified as civilians) and the propping up of un-representative governments in  the Middle East, that gave birth to the perpetrators of the crashes at the World Trade Centre? Did we not create  monstrous dictators such as Saddam Hussein?<br>
Or the freedom fighter/terrorist Osama-Bin-Laden? <br>
Do we see any acknowledgment of these facts? <br>
No! Instead there are mindless calls for revenge. Blame some-one else! Point the finger!  Portray ourselves as innocents! Blameless! The beacons of light in a savage world! Without guilt or responsibility for the horrors that were visited on innocent Arab or Muslim civilians! Civilian deaths that continue even as this debate rages on! <br>
And what about the trade deals that are plunging the majority of the worlds populations into desperate poverty and hunger?  Trade deals that place Corporate rights above those of humans. <br>
Are we not reaping that which we ourselves have sown? <br>
No two ways about it! Any decent minded person would call last Tuesdays occurrences &quot; Terrorism&quot;. <br>
Therefore I mourn the loss of innocent lives be they American, or African, or Iraqi, or Palestinian or Chechen or Colombian. <br>
We know who is being blamed for the loss of American lives! Who are we to blame for the continuing loss of human life around the globe? <br>
In an enlightened world the only humane response is to abhor and avoid violence. <br>
As Mahatma Gandhi  eloquently put it so long ago; <br>
<i>An eye for an eye will only lead to the world becoming blind.</i> <br>
Let us respond to this grievous act with vision instead. <br>
It is only the strong and powerful who can renounce violence, because the strong and the wealthy have so many other options at their disposal. The weak, the powerless, the oppressed obviously don't have many options. <br>
It is time , for the sake of humanity, for the sake of the environment, to renounce violence as a way for human beings to settle their differences. <br>

time someone brings up the vital ideas so many have mentioned on these
pages, that we should look for the root causes of this disaster, and that if
you continually terrorize people in other nations terror will eventually
find its way back here, the reply is that there is no justification for what
happened.  We need to keep insisting that understanding why something
happens is not the same as justifying it, and that understanding is in fact
the only way to chart a course of action that won't cause this to keep
happening.</font></p>

don't stamp out violence with violence.  Most people were taught as
children, and teach their own children, not to hit one another to solve
problems:  &quot;Don't hit back,&quot; &quot;use words,&quot; &quot;get help,&quot; we tell children when
they face aggression.  Unfortunately, what they are learning from watching
their elders in this system is &quot;punish,&quot; &quot;retaliate,&quot; &quot;destroy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we only had space to think calmly about what to do, I believe most
people, even though they are so angry and hurt, would be willing to find a
sensible, longlasting approach to stopping the violence.  The problem is
that with the drumbeat relentlessly sounding, people are not being given
that space.  How to create it?</font></p>

Those Americans died for oil.  Yet this issue is largely ignored by the mainstream media.  This is the opportunity to focus on alternative forms of energy to reduce and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.  I wonder if Rudolf Deisel, who invented his engine for soybean oil, would have anything to say?  How about American farmers?  And what about other forms of alternative fuels that could have seen the benefit from a large investment to fuel a war on energy instead of the $40 billion which our congress just appropriated for a war on terrorism?  Or is the war machine just a way to help put our country back on the track away from recession?  How nice it would be to see stimulating our economy in a cleaner, healthier and safer world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My initial thought was to contribute to the discussion of Tuesday&#146;s tragedy by advancing a logical, well reasoned presentation setting forth reasons why heart-felt appeal to our national leaders begging them to respond to the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon with restraint and justice are an exercise in futility.  They can not and will not respond with less than military force.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any social order resting on foundations of injustice can not to defuse the anger and hatred of those who suffer its injustice by extending  justice.  Such social orders, inherently unable to act justly, can only repress those who rebel, and thus generate more still injustice and violence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a historical example, the American antebellum South comes to mind.  To do justice to its slave population would have meant abandoning its social structure.  This it could not and would not do. Various forms of repression were its only option. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So too today as then, as world capitalism lives out its operational policy made explicit more than fifty years ago by George F. Kennan.  That policy was, to paraphrase Ambassador Kennan, that the United States with six percent of the world&#146;s population consumes more than twenty five percent of the worlds resources &#150; and we should keep it that way.  Nothing has changed, only the numbers.  Injustice continues to be the rule.</font></p>
