<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I&#146;m still in a state of shock concerning Yesterday's events.  Insofar as US
foreign policy is concerned, the implications of this recent national
tragedy are significant.  While I am in no way apologizing for this
terrible and cowardly act, it is important to point out that terrorism has
always had two faces -  terrorists to some, are freedom fighters to others.
Ironically, the suspected perpetrator of this recent terrorist act, Osama
Bin Laden, cut his teeth in the Mujahadeen, 'freedom fighters' armed and
trained in the martial arts by US military advisors.  The objective of the
Mujahadeen was to destabilize Soviet control of Afghanistan.  It succeeded.
The war in Afghanistan has been accurately described as Russia&#146;s Vietnam.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US policy of destabilizing leftist regimes around the world has not led
to stable democratic governments.  Most often, these countries are racked by
civil war until a strongman or totalitarian regime takes over.  Examples
include; Panama, El Salvador and most notably &#150; Afghanistan.  They say that
history is bound to repeat itself.  Haven&#146;t we seen this scenario play out
before with Manuel Noriega in Panama?  The thought of George Bush Jr.
hunting down a former CIA operative is as surreal as the terrorist attack
itself.  US foreign policy must be revisited in the wake of this tragedy.</font></p>

against those who seek to destroy us with terror. Our hearts cry for
vengeance but hate will make us less as a people.  America will become
like those that hate us.  We want vengeance but each one of us should
offer forgiveness to those terrorists filled with fanatical hate toward
Americans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We then can look at why others hate America and where we can find
change within us.  America must change, for we instigate the hate of
others and the terror some unleash on us.  America is an arrogant place
where through &#147;manifest destiny&#148; we seek to make the world more
&#147;American&#148;.  With arrogance we push our &#147;American&#148; economy, society and
culture onto the rest of the world.  The world begins to hate us.
America forces itself on the world, pitting nations against one another,
to gain political fortune.  The people of the world die.  Innocent
people die from war, hunger, disease and terror.  Now innocent Americans
die from our arrogance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
     Perhaps now is the time for humility.  The rest of the world is so
different than us.  America should step back and let the world grow,
live and make the same mistakes we have made in our history.  America
must not isolate from the world but open to the world&#146;s other economies,
societies and cultures.  We must not change the world in our image but
humbly coexist with others.  Working towards one world that is good for
all, not just for America.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    America, we will recover from the terrorism that haunt us now.  As a
people we are tough and will rise above those filled with hate.  With
hope America will rise above without extreme hate and arrogance but love
and humility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right now, I agree that the immediate response must be one of total
solidarity with the victims, and
against the terrorists who committed these massacres.  However, when the dust
settles and calmer reflection is engaged in, I hope that the US
will be more self-critical than they've been in similar circumstances in the
past.  [For example, to this day, I have never heard an American
acknowledge that the anger of the Iranian people in 1980 was because the CIA
assassinated their democratically elected leader, Mosadegh,
in 1953, and installed the anachronistic Shah as America's 'Man in Teheran' for
27 years.]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        I think that what Bush said about us being targeted in today's attack
&quot;because we are a beacon of freedom&quot; is totally false.  I think we
were targeted because our new government is totally insensitive to certain
groups of victimized people in the world, particularly the
Palestinians.  I hate to say this because I have some wonderful Jewish friends
but Israel has become totally intransigent on the issue of peace
and land over there;  and this Bush Administration has encouraged them in this
course of action.  It was obvious, even to relatively
disinterested observers of the scene in Israel, that it is heading for a
conflagration.  At some point, hopefully in time to change our posture in
the Middle East before the whole thing blows up, this kind of self-recrimination
needs to take place.  Do I think it will happen though?  No.
George W Bush and the Republican Administration are far too arrogant,
self-righteous, pugnacious and war-mongering to ever contemplate
any change of heart like that.</font></p>

We must be willing to die but not to kill.  A planetary pact for mutual survival.   Nothing less than this will do.

Share what we have and make certain no one goes without. We must begin to see each other as global family united in our vulnerability and yearning for true freedom.  We need to entirely redefine our concepts of nations and community.   This is the only security plan that has any hope of sparing us the nightmare of global ruin.

U.S. General in an interview that in America, we always thought we were
invulnerable. She continued: &quot;Why did this happen and maybe we have to

the U.S. empire. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The narcissistic and arrogant and smug sickly hyper self-loving nature of

instance, who were killed under U.S. bombing campaigns in Iraq. As long as

can no longer apply a brutal foreign policy without suffering any domestic 
consequences. For a country which 'carpet bombed' Baghdad and Belgrade from 
30 000 feet to call these attacks 'cowardly' is irrational. If other cities 
must suffer this way then America must be prepared to accept the 
consequences. Until now US citizens believed themselves to be untouchable: 
Not any more.
My sympathy is with those innocent people who lost their lives, but not 
only in New York &amp; Washington, but in Belgrade, Kabul, Libya, Sudan &amp; Iraq. 
American lives are not worth more than other peoples and Americans can no 
longer brutalize the rest of the world with impunity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Yesterday, as I watched the falling of the towers on live TV during my freshman science class at high school, the full repercussions of this tragedy never occurred to me.  First of all, I didn't realize how many people were actually in that building.  I thought that casualties would be easily under one hundred, let alone running in the thousands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But far beyond the obvious results of this incident such as the thousands of dead and wounded, there are the repercussions that I believe will happen in the near future if nothing is done to prevent them.  As I have already seen begin to emerge among my peers, a discriminatory, anti-Arab fervor is spreading around American society.  We must be careful to prevent the use of Arab peoples as a scapegoat and target of revenge after the tragedy that occurred yesterday.  The possibility of Muslim extremist groups having involvement with this act of terrorism runs high, but accusing every person of Arabic origin to be a guilty party would be an outrageous but very possible crime.  In times like these, people want someone to blame.  We must control ourselves and not jump to any conclusions about who did this and who is guilty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I fear, as many other like-minded people I'm sure do, that those who wish to increase our military spending will use this incident as an excuse.  Building more weapons of mass destruction, increasing the size of our armed forces, or constructing a &quot;missile defense shield&quot; will not protect us, nor will it solve the problem of global terrorism.  The United States of America needs to re-analyze its foreign policy.  If it was in fact a Muslim extremist group who conducted this attack, the reasons are most likely quite obvious.  The United States gives one billion dollars a year to the nation of Israel.  I support and believe in Israel's right to exist, but Israel is and has been for quite some time a racist, repressive state when it comes to the people of Palestine.  As I saw on TV, some Palestinians celebrated yesterday's attack.  I don't agree with that, but they have every reason to.  American guns kill their innocent friends and family every day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What happened yesterday was a crime against the people of America and the people of the world.  I mourn the deaths of those who died in the initial attack, and those who died trying to save lives afterwards.  But now is not the time to react in blind anger.  We must proceed with caution.  There has been enough bloodshed, we don't want to kill innocent Afghanis in retaliation.  Military retaliation against possible suspects is not the answer.  For now we should mourn the dead and hope for peace.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To those of you who insist on immediate retaliation and rallying around the
President (In particular, Shane from Idaho):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. As Americans we have no obligation to rally round the President regarding
our peacetime foreign policy.   Contrary to the rhetoric here, heard and
seen elsewhere, America is (probably) not under imminent threat of another
attack and by no means under threat of a possible invasion.  This is not
Pearl Harbor and we are not yet at war with any nation.  In 1941, the threat
was real because the nations we faced were &quot;significant and credible&quot; as
military opponents, to borrow the words of one Bush Administration official.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. If we do find that a national government is responsible for this attack
then we have a right to demand a firm and swift response from the United
Nations and a right to use our own military unilaterally IF and ONLY IF
there are no viable alternatives.  If we do choose to use violence we have
an obligation to formally declare war on that nation and make clear at the
outset our terms for settlement/surrender.  That's a minimum requirement for
a just military action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. It is disgusting to listen to these foreign policy hawks proudly claim
how willing they are to ignore international law and how easily they'd chuck
out the US Constitution when it comes to raining bombs and retaliatory
terror on foreign peoples.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. No sane or moral person could believe that innocent victims deserve to
die - here or abroad.  I have yet to see a post here that implies that
except from those of you who think it's time to load up the Aircraft
Carriers and attack someone, somewhere in the name of justice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What many of us ARE claiming is that unless we reassess our role in the world
and our support for murder, dictators, oppression and violence, we should
expect more carnage in the future to be brought to our soil.  On our current
path, we will live in an increasingly violent world whether we deserve it or
not.</font></p>

warning that the United State must change its (admittedly atrocious) foreign

attacks. There seems to be an assumption that they are linked to the Middle
East. Yet the last mass murder, in Oklahoma, was the work of home-grown
Americans with grievances of their own against the US government. Was the
lesson of Oklahoma that the federal government should put itself out of
business? I'm not saying that there are not millions of people world-wide
with legitimate grievances against the US government. I am saying that to
link those grievances with the murder of tens of thousands of people who
simply woke up in the morning and went to work, is to legitimize the same
thinking that could lead to the bombing of Kabul.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let me start by saying that I am an liberal American and damn proud to be both.  One of the reasons that I voted for Ralph Nader last year was that he took a strong stand against excessive military spending, missile defense, the sanctions on Iraq, the mistreatment of the Palestinians by Israel, the policies of the IMF and World Bank, and other aspects of our insufferably arrogant and bellicose foreign policy.  However, I also agreed with him that we can't reduce our defense budget to zero, which is what this country might as well do if it refuses to defend itself.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Many on the left warn against &quot;retaliation&quot; and tell us to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;.  Although we sink to the level of the terrorists if we lash out indiscriminately, I don't think that it is unjust to hunt down those who actually committed this monstrous crime.  It is self-defense.  How do we know that they will not attack us again?  How do we know that refusing to act won't embolden other terrorists to attack us?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Although I believe that we need to change substantially the way that we treat other countries, making these changes as capitulation to mass murder and blackmail really sticks in my craw.  Since the terrorists were too cowardly to claim responsibility for the bombing, we don't even know who to appease or how to appease them.  There are far too many groups in the world with conflicting demands for us to appease everyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
BTW, the agenda of terrorists is filled with some pretty nasty things.  If we make it our first priority to find out how Big Bad America is &quot;victimizing&quot; them, and make it clear we view self-defense as an evil exercise that &quot;just increases the level of violence&quot;, what's to stop us from being blackmailed by all sorts of groups with hideous ideas?  What about domestic white supremacists?  Can they bomb our black brothers and sisters back to Africa (never mind that many of their families have been here since before the Civil War)?  Can Taliban-loving fanatics bomb our women back into subservience because American culture is so dominant and might undermine their terrible misinterpretation of Islam?  Many terrorists hate democracy.  Can they bomb us into a dictatorship that Stalin would envy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Let us work for peace and justice in our world, but let us not forget our right to have peace and justice in America.</font></p>

trade movement, what ever you want to call it). Already activists are
talking about calling off the Sept. 29-30 protests. I feel this should
only be done it the IMF meetings are canceled. We have to make the case
that this happened because of globalization, because of US militarism.
This is the price we pay for our free market capitalism, and ignoring
the needs of the poor. I&#146;m not entirely sure yet how to make that case
successfully to many Americans who want revenge even though they are
also victims of US capitalism, but I do know that if we pause in the
face of this tragedy; if we let it slow the momentum of our protests, if
we let it quiet the tone of our voices and our outrage, if we let it
slow down our organizing, if we let it slow our third party building,
and sideline our progressive journalism and artwork this movement will
quickly die. There are people suffering all over the world many of them
here in the US, many of us in the movement are those people. They need
us not to give in to conservative agendas and symbols (like &#147;limited
protests&#148; or ignoring the upcoming welfare reform renewal) out of fear
and guilt. If we weaken our stance and let our momentum slow, those in
need (including many of us) will be crushed, and it will take another
20-30 years for this movement to build again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I watched the news yesterday, I began to cry very softly.  Part of it 
was from the horror at the destruction, but another part of my mind was 
mourning the loss of progress toward peace as American politicians took to 
the TV, promising &quot;punishment&quot; with ugly undertones of violence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The way our nation has reacted to this tragedy has not inspired any hope 
for peace in me.  I can feel a miasma of suspicion, paranoia, and vengeance 
pouring over me, that same miasma that warps people's ability to care for 
others, to forgive.  The same poison that twists every situation into a 
life-or-death situation, so that every action/reaction of violence on the 
US's part is regarded as both appropriate and necessary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The creation and testing of weapons will only cost the world more human and 
environmental damage, pushing other nations who are hurt by our pollution 
and testing processes to desperate measures to show their objection to 
American actions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now IS a time for Americans to wake up-- to know that most of the citizens 
of the world have several valid reasons to be angry at Americans 
ignorant/apathetic consumption patterns, which drives international 
businesses to commit atrocities abroad in countless places, to countless 
innocents.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Can being sensitive and caring to the other peoples of the world prevent 
terrorism completely?  Probably not, but it is something that every single 
person can do, and it, unlike the creation of more weapons, will at least 
decrease the chance of more terrorism.  The creation of more weapons will 
only lead to the creation of better weapons, which only tears at the 
fragile world we are currently living in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace.</font></p>

have become even more convinced that it is our own hubris that lead us
into this situation.  We are supporting and indirectly advocating
various acts and governments in the Middle East yet expect to remain
&quot;clean&quot; of the bloody events.  We pretend that Israel is not acting as
terrorists in Palestine while condemning any act by the Palestinians in
retaliation or defense of &quot;their&quot; lands. No oil interest is worth the
lives lost already, let us stop it now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is my hope and prayer that we will rethink our biased and imbalanced
policies in this region and remove our money, equipment and above all,
our military men and women.  We must advance the cause of peace while
remaining strong enough to bring judgment upon those who have inflicted
this wound upon us.  Only through careful planning and execution of
covert actions will we even have a ghost of a chance to track down bin
Laden or another responsible party.  A full-scale war will not solve the
problem and will undoubtedly lead only to further loss of personnel, on
all sides. PRAY FOR PEACE and act accordingly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ladies and Gentlemen,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us first pray - Give forgiveness for the loved ones taken from us
and give thanks for the loved ones who were spared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this time of great world crisis, one which man has made himself, we
can not let this tragedy weaken our resolve to bring peace into this
world.  We must take from this event an increased devotion to make this
World, Our World, better for all things man and beast.  The enormity of
our personal losses can only go to reinforce the urgency with which we
must act to change our ways - to foremost let go of greed, as that is
the first step towards true peace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is tempting to explain this death and destruction in the realm of
culture, politics, and religion - but this is not so.  We can only think
of these attacks within the context of historical action, and
environmental repercussions.  After all does it really matter who
perpetuated these deeds on us?  Does it really matter why they did it?
American, Chinese, or Arab - for God, for Country or for Love all these
are moot when we see this action as part of all our actions.  To be
clear about the point I am trying to make: Man is behaving no
differently than how any other animal on this planet would behave when
faced with severe environmental stress.  From fish to snake to ant to
bear all will destroy themselves when faced with the extremes of
starvation and predation - and in this way man has behaved no
differently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So I ask each and every one of us: Is the pain you feel from the sadness
of the loss of our loved brethren?  Or is it the shame of knowing that
if we had all lived are lives with true love and responsibility, if each
and every one of us had dedicated ourselves to making this World better
for all things that inhabit it, then none of this would have happened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until now I have been quietly spreading the message - that we must
change our ways or suffer the inevitable dire consequences.  But I see
that few have heeded my word.  So now I will speak with great voice and
urgency; choose now and choose wisely.  Our leaders will come to us with
plans of revenge - retaliation - retribution - reprisal; they will say
that to continue our ways we must react violently and swiftly.  We must
deny them.  We must say to them they we do not want to continue our
ways, that we are sick of the greed, made sore of the arrogance and grow
weary of our dismissive disregard of all others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World will no longer tolerate the presence of people who live their
lives as we do, so we must be the ones to change or we will have those
changes imposed upon us.</font></p>
