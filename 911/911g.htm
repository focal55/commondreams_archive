I am deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks on our nation. My prayers and deepest sympathy go out to all those who lost a loved one.. 
However, I do not think it would be wise to drop bombs in the Middle East or wage war on Afghanistan. Thousands of innocent people would be killed if we act with violence. This will bring no one back from the dead, or rebuild our national treasures. Nor will it prevent more terrorist attacks. In fact, it might cause more attacks even more deadly and ruthless. Is shedding blood really the best way? Will we as a nation feel justified by causing enormous pain and suffering on even more innocent people? Wouldn't that make us as bad as the terrorists. Maybe they were seeking vengeance and retaliations for the numerous bombs we have dropped in the Middle East. We should reevaluate our foreign policy, and finds ways to spread peace in the world. A third world war may result in our own extinction! It is a hard and difficult thing to do, to fight violence with wisdom, peace, and love . Let us look to Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;An for an eye will make the whole world blind&quot;</i> - Mahatma Gandhi</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would like to quote a eulogy written by Martin Luther King for several young girls murdered in a church by a bomb as they attended Sunday school on September 15, 1963. <i>&quot;We must not become bitter; nor must we harbor the desire to retaliate with violence.
So in spite of the darkness of this hour we must not despair. We must not lose faith in our white brothers. Some how we must believe that the most misguided among them can learn to respect the dignity and worth of all human personality&quot;</i> - Martin Luther King</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Because of those words of nonviolence this country evolved. May we learn how to love in the face of hatred, and find ways to stop violence before it happens, that is our best defense! </font></p>

I look at the flag-waving people on television and here and there around our town, a suburb of Portland, Or, and I wonder whether they've thought all this through.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
I haven't.  My head is still spinning from the patriotic &quot;go-get-em&quot; spin that has been laid over this tragedy in the past few days by the major media and just about everyone that has appeared therein.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
And I'm certain that few others have thought this through either - including those who sit in the nation's capitol and make their decisions about waging yet another war I, as a citizen, did not authorize them to wage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
I've determined, for myself, that the thing to do is to go into mourning for thirty days and I'm wearing the traditional black armband as I type this; just a strip of  wide black ribbon knotted about my shirt on my upper left arm, cost me about thirty cents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
While I'm wearing this black armband and mourn the loss of all those people I never knew and mourn for their families and loved ones, I'm also in mourning for the impact all this has had on our country and for the potential loss of what this nation is allegedly about - freedom and the right to a voice in such matters as waging war, however diluted that voice may become as a result of the representative style of democracy we live under.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
And, while I mourn, I intend to carefully consider what it is best to do about all this - not that anyone cares what I think; but I care what I think and I want to fully understand why this happened, really.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Since we do not seem to have an enlightened leadership, perhaps it is incumbent on each of the rest of us to still our flags into a simple display of solidarity among ourselves, put on respectful black armbands for thirty days to mourn our losses and really consider what has happened and why.  We may adopt a broader worldview than our benighted 'leaders' and perhaps we'll come up with a better solution than just killing more people, ad infinitum.  </font></p>

I am very grateful for a site such as this, and for the hundreds of 
responses from people who share a great common dream: PEACE. In times like 
these I feel so alone...but those of us who dissent must speak up. We are 
definitely NOT ALONE. I am truly scared to let others hear what I have to 
say, but I will do it anyway. I will not fall into the trap of blind 
patriotism, and I will not tolerate anymore indiscriminate killing of innocents. We as dissenters, we as seekers of the truth need to stand up and 
say NO MORE.</font></p>

The only thing we know is that four airplanes were hijacked by suicidal fanatics, three crashed into buildings, the other crashed into the ground. Everything else is speculation and theory. If Bush would have explained it in similar terms, we wouldn't have this rush to judgment. It could very well have all been planned and executed by the fanatics, and when they crashed, that was that. We have enemies all over the world, including Iran and Iraq, any of them could have done it. All the so-called evidence the FBI is gathering doesn't necessarily follow the scenario they claim it does. </font></p>

Dear Mr. Bush,<br>
Please learn more about other ways to end terrorism besides striking back in 
a violent way.  You must hear from some of us in this country that starting a 
war is not the way to go.  Learning the non-violent way is the only way we in 
this new century can create a future for our children, human and non-human.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Please choose a path that truly gives you the stature of being a leader of a 
peace-loving nation.  You are looked to as one who might bring a dramatic 
change through love and not hate.  As a man of faith, may you be an example 
of one who is willing to see the deeper problems that underlie this terrible 
day we have all just experienced. Our nation has done acts of violence that 
caused many deaths over many years.  Now is the time to lead in a new 
direction.
We are counting on you.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Jean E. Barker

Please choose peace, and let your friends, family, and co-workers know why. Talk to them, write letters to the editor. Then contact Bush and your Congresspeople. We must resist this emotional, blind rush toward increasing the violence! It could lead to an endless war, a series of genocides. If you don't agree, I hope you realize that you can't obtain all the information you need for an informed opinion from mainstream media, even &quot;public&quot; radio. Inform yourself (www.zmag.org is a good website) as to possible reasons the U.S. needs to stop and check itself out. Look into your heart. Is there any compassion there for the people in other countries who have suffered because of our country's militaristic, pro-corporate policies? What they've gone through is years and years of what we in this country have just experienced. Let's stand together -- I agree -- but as brothers and sisters of the planet earth. We need to take care of each other (and of our earth home). Fly the earth flag -- put it in your window.</font></p>

Should not the definition of terrorism be independent of

I wonder how many people in Europe will keep 3 minutes of silence for

demanded by a revengeful  blood thirsty US public? If the genocide being
perpetuated in Iraq offers any clue,  very few will.
And just when I thought I was all alone I find thousands who share the
same dreams of justice for all. Thank you.</font></p>

How do Christians, such as those in the current administration, respond to a holy war by Muslim fanatics?  As we learned in Vietnam, wars are only won by America if we believe we are right.  If we doubt ourselves, we don't have the heart to win. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course we are right to believe that terrorists are mass murderers and should be treated as such.  But Bush has declared war, not a manhunt for criminals.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Christian response is to love your enemy and turn the other cheek.  Perhaps this is too much to expect from a secular government. </font></p>

In fact, this country worships the golden calf, and has turned away from the way of  &quot;love your neighbor&quot;, with its talk of missile shields and treaty breaking. </font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I see how stiff-necked this people is,&quot; continued the LORD to Moses. <br>
   For they have become depraved. <br>
   They have soon turned aside from the way I pointed out to them, <br>
   making for themselves a molten calf and worshiping it, <br>
   sacrificing to it and crying out, <br>
   'This is your God, O Israel, <br>
   who brought you out of the land of Egypt!' Let me alone, then, <br>
   that my wrath may blaze up against them to consume them. &quot; <br>
                                          Ex 32: 8-10 <br>
  <br>
As we pray for those who have died, and for those who are bereaved, let us also pray that God will turn us back to Him, so that we may be righteous in fighting the Jihad, and have the spirit to win.     In Jesus' name,  Carol Wolman </font></p>

I live in Arlington County, Virginia.  It is my home, and also the place where the Pentagon is.  For those of you not familiar with it, it is a mostly quiet leafy place -- the second smallest county in the country, possibly the most Democratic, as well as the most democratic, place here.  It is a suburb which also houses the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery, Fort Myer, National Airport, and many federal agencies, but mostly it is a place where people live -- raise families, worry about the schools, argue about dog parks, commute to work in DC or the tech belt beyond us.  We are largely uppermiddle class, with a very high percentage of college-educated adults, but we also have a large population of immigrants -- our schools educate children who speak about 90 languages, and we are proud that they are here.  We have the best selection of ethnic restaurants in the world -- I can choose from Vietnamese, Persian, Chinese, Thai, Afghan, Cambodian, Ethiopian, etc. etc. etc.   </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My family's personal experiences on Tuesday are trivial -- my husband had to walk the five miles home from his office in the city, our streets were closed in order to allow the passage of emergency equipment, my daughter was awakened by the passing of the plane en route to the Pentagon.  Our fire and rescue services have been organizing the work at the Pentagon.  It has been hard and bitter work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The attack on the Pentagon on Tuesday, while minor by comparison with the devastation in New York, has left us all stunned.  How could this happen in our pleasant place?  What can we do about it?  I am not politically sophisticated, although I have lived in six countries and speak several languages.   I don't want to take sides in the debate which is going on now, but I just want to say that we must be careful and thoughtful about our support of, or our opposition to, what happened.  Some of the rhetoric on this site has been hatefilled -- please slow down and think more rationally.  Many of the letters have almost completed the circle and are in agreement with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who think that we deserve what happened, albeit for different reasons.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  From Webster's dictionary, terrorism is &quot;the systematic use of terror, especially as a means of coercion.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Having been a media addict since Tuesday in my desire to know more, I am appalled to watch as the terrorism is now reapplied in an effort to rally the nation to war.  How does one define this new usage of terror?  Leading us into a war that can not be won with weapons, fighting and death.  This war you speak of is not an end.  Nor is it a means to a positive end.  By going to war, we will only perpetuate the very &quot;evil&quot; we claim to be fighting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  As a lifelong American citizen, I wish to express my firm belief that going to war is wrong.  I ask you to reflect on history, to learn from mistakes that have been made, and to lead us in a new direction.  Be strong, and lead us away from war.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this moment, before the United States has retaliated, is a golden
moment of opportunity. We have not yet put into motion the unending
cycle of violence answering violence. Let me posit an admittedly
far-fetched fantasy:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What if President Bush, citing Jesus' admonition to turn the other
cheek, declared to the world that the United States would refrain from responding militarily to this act of barbarism. It would be such a
stunning display of enlightened, 21st century leadership, that the
symbol of those disintegrating towers would be transformed from one of
death into one of rebirth. The world would be shocked at the United
States' good will and Zen wisdom. Our image as a Rogue Superpower would
be immediately transformed into true world leader. Bush would be seen as
a great hero - as he indeed would be, for being able to transcend the
impulse towards and eye for an eye.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, President Bush, as you consider your options, I beg you to ask
yourself this question: &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot;</font></p>

Thank you for organizing this message board, I hope all who have discovered it will inform others. As the tears flow while I read the messages, I find myself wishing there were a way to organize all the individual contributors into a political force to prevent what seems to be the inexorable response to Tuesday's mass murder, more mass murder.</font></p>

I didn't hear from one of my best friends until Friday -- but even while I thought she was lost in the rubble, I didn't think in terms of revenge.  Obviously pouring injustices out on the world -- like killing a million Iraqis without a second thought -- was a major part of why my city is now suffering.  If we were to really exact revenge for those responsible for this attack, how could we leave out Washington, and New York? Washington gives the world at large every reason to want to destroy us, and New York media runs interference with the best spin in the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
 How do we get our fellow Americans to be honest and realistic about the unjust pain the U.S. metes out to the world?  How do we get people to realize that these &quot;realistic&quot; cloak and dagger types are usually the ones who created our villains (Noriega, Contra crack dealing, giving Saddam chemical weapons to poison Iranians, giving Afghanis weapons up the wazoo just as &quot;revenge&quot; on the Soviets for Vietnam...)?</font></p>

I'm frustrated and torn between whether to support this administration's
poorly thought out foreign policy through unilateralism, isolationism and the arrogance that our country is the &quot;best.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Middle East, in which we've built up each faction with aid and
political compromise, has been known to be a hotbed for religious
persecution in all its horrific forms. As we go about our own misguided
way through revenge there is one detail which leaves me even more
fearful: The invocation of &quot;god&quot; on our side as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friday was declared as not just a  day of remembrance but a day of
prayer as well. For someone who still believes in the idea of a secular
state which recognizes all and no religion simultaneously in the pursuit
of equality for all this small item is a big problem which lowers us
further to participating within a holy war: Our head of state is
invoking Christianity with every stop while the &quot;enemy&quot; is perceived to
believe in their deity which is, by our skewed perception, inferior to
ours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is bad enough that detrimental foreign policy on our part was called
and put us in the position in which civilian lives were lost upon United
States soil. This position makes it even worse when millions of
citizens' brains are braised by the searing heat of American religious
patriotism which, with abundant iconic flag waving, will wind up further
dividing this nation between those who want further blood in the name of &quot;god&quot; and those with clearer heads willing to become pariahs just
because they question our position. In fact, up to this moment, our
position in retribution is exactly like the terrorists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who pays the price? We do. Civilian lives were lost overseas and here.
We can keep the blood flowing or we can call all parties involved,
including foreign governments which may be harboring terrorism, and end
this need for blind vengeance and replace it with justice. All
governments, including ours, should be questioned as we go about finding
a solution. We're the ones in the middle of this as our side pulls and
the terrorists pushes us all towards the brink of escalated genocidal
warfare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are no longer a superpower. Our arrogance cost our country lives.
Freedom wasn't attacked and destroyed but families and livelihood was.
When we start cracking down upon our own by rescinding civil liberties we
march in lockstep to become what we rally against. What are we to do in
the long-term to make sure this never happens again?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's bad when I can't fully bring myself to support our government's
position but that doesn't mean I support this horrific act of the
terrorists. With this view I'm perceived as such by my peers. When will
we open our eyes to the whole truth and see what we've become? We have
an enemy but who as we go to war? I'm not the enemy for my position just
as much that anyone of Arabic descent isn't either.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, blind religious patriotism will do us in further. My
sympathies are to all civilians caught in the middle of all of this who
have to pay the ultimate price.</font></p>
