<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank-you for providing this forum.  I've been watching the TV in horror not only because of the events of yesterday but because of the responses of our gov't, financial analysts and journalists.  I was becoming very alienated and depressed until something told me to check out commondreams.org.  As I read these thoughts I know there are others,  many, many, many others who take time to think intelligently and feel deeply, who are not racists bent on protecting their power and money.  I feel the events of yesterday are the tragic consequences of cause and effect.  Not only have we caused these events with our monstrous foreign policies but also with out complete disregard of our environment causing mortal damage to Earth (Earth is a living being) and other species that co-exist with us.  Everytime I drive to a nearby city I see bulldozers destroying hundreds of acres of woodlands to make way for yet another freeway so that we can get to our offices faster to make more money.  I know the trees, rabbits, deer, birds, squirrels, etc, etc, etc, etc feel the terrorist attack that has been perpetrated on them.  Thanks again to commondreams for providing this forum and all the people who are providing their thoughts----I feel more hopeful. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 7:00 PDT i was awoken by the phone and my partner telling me that the WTC
and the pentagon had been hit.  I fell back asleep in disbelief.  At 7:30 PDT
my mother called from New Hampshire to say the same.  Sleep rolled off of me
slowly until I turned on the tv to CNN. . . and there it was.  My jaw
dropped and my heart went out to all the people there as i sat watching,
waiting. . . and then sadness filled me, sadness that the foreign policy of
this country has come back to haunt us; sadness that our government has been
so arrogant that a lesson like this occurred; sadness that what should be
learned from this by those in power is being overlooked.  Retribution,
retaliation... have we learned nothing?  It is US policies of terror in
other countries that have brought this down upon us.  It is time for
everyone who can to organize, to yell in one voice that things must change
for the entire world.  And we must make sure to remember the internment
camps during world war two and not repeat that in any form towards any
people that the US propaganda machine says is responsible.  The time to
stand is now, but not to fight, not to kill, to change US ways of
interacting with the world.  Yesterday was a sad day and must be remembered
and learned from.  My thoughts are with all who have suffered here, as they
have been with others who have suffered and continue to suffer worldwide.</font></p>

let us not forget that what has happened is a result of many many

society. I don't know all the facts, and I'm not a politician, but I do
believe that what we need to focus on now- as a nation- is the REASON this
attack was made; not how another one can be prevented with more security.
If we don't look at our foreign policy and make some changes, nothing will
ever be resolved. &quot;Retaliation&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; is an understandable
reaction, but PLEASE look through the lies and anger so that we can address
the situation with  clear minds. Without clear minds- we will only make it

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ever since the events unfolded, I have been feeling numb. I watched in shock  as I saw both buildings fall down to the ground live on TV. There is no excuse for such a horrific event. Yet as angry as I am, as well as many others, I feel that people need to understand why this happened. What would cause a group of people to organize such an act? <br>
 <br>
In order to understand  the cause we must understand why there is terrorism . I am no expert and I can only speak from my own personal experience, but terrorism to me is an act of despair that is used to send a message to the world. This act was a big message sent to the US. As one person who I talked to said &quot;The chickens have some to roost.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I believe that this is true. The US is getting a taste of their own medicine. The US have dominated the Middle East and bombed Iraq to the stone age. The US supports Israel who is causing hell to the Palestinians. The US bombed Belgrade, invaded Columbia, etc.<br>
Though this is a great tragedy for the people of the US and even a greater tragedy for those who know people who have lost their lives, we need to think about all the lives that were lost through US domination. We cannot forget all the innocent people and their families all around the world who have suffered by US bombings, invasions, and austerity measures.   </font></td>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You may not like my point of view and I disagree with some of yours.  Yet
here we are discussing all of this in open forum, free to call the US
terrorist, and free to decry the &quot;terrorist&quot; actions of our country.  Try
that in Iraq, or Libya or Iran, or Syria.  We'd be all facing firing squads
or prison at least. (By the way you could do this freely in Israel.)
It's so easy to blame the American government for all of this... and point
to our policies in the Middle East as a driving factor.  But the reality is
that what we have in the Middle East is a case of hatred and fear.  The
world felt guilty after World War II about the Holocaust, about how America
and the rest of the world stood by and watched six million people be
exterminated merely because they belonged to a religion.  And no we have
500,000 displaced Palestinians who have been written off for fifty years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Fear and hatred, not the American government is to blame.  But there is
hope.  Look at what's happening in Northern Ireland (partly brokered by the
American government).  If they can do that there then it can happen in the
Middle East.  But we must recognize that Israel is going to go away and
neither are the Palestinians.  We must find ways of getting past the hate
and fear on both sides.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   First, the statements of our cowboy president force us to avert our gaze and look elsewhere for leadership.  Focus where?  The only Bush administration official who did himself proud was Donald Rumsfeld, the Elder, who actually went to the scene of death and destruction in Virginia and helped with rescue efforts.  The rest of our leaders, including the president, disappeared.  All that could be seen of Bush was jet trails, crisscrossing the continent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   We can look at the nearly 300 police and fire department personnel who died at the trade center, died trying to help others.  We can look at the lines of good neighborhood people from the Boroughs who are standing in line to give blood to help other people.  Faceless crowds of good Americans willing to go wherever they are needed to help other people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
This is real heroism.  Wall Street has closed down, but the people came through.  We are finally reading about great value that is not for sale.  The market is nowhere to be seen; only love and generosity shown by ordinary people.</font></p>

Maybe we should be grateful that George Bush got out of the way so we could see clearly what we are and who we are.  Those faceless crowds make us proud.</font></p>

 <br>
I do hope that people can from now on help and support fellow human beings during times of peace as well as in times of . . . horror.  I cannot help but think that the growth of indifference in U.S. culture feeds terrifying acts such as those that occurred on 11 September.  As many others have stated, perhaps the U.S. people can now focus on joining others for and in peace and for the improvement of all people's human condition--not for profits and the increase of inhumane imperialism.<br>

persuasion) are held up as beacons of freedom for the progressives here.
You people are jumping up and down with joy on the corpses of the World

loved one died because the damn well deserved to die. All these pathetic
posts start with, &quot;I don't condone these actions&quot;, followed by why we
deserve them and should get more of them. You are as progessive as any

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jane and I go to a candlelight vigil at noontime in Stanford's Memorial 
Church, along with hundreds of others. Waiting for it to begin, listening 
to the music, more weeping. It's always the innocents who die. It's always 
the innocents who pay. A prayer goes up for restraint. A good prayer. 
People come forward and light candles. Finally, a man comes forward, takes 
the mike, and rambles incoherently forever about god and George Bush. I 
expect him to suggest nuclear retaliation. Jane whispers, &quot;Wanna go?&quot; I 
say, &quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>

Hennessy sends out email suggesting that employees who need to can go home.</font></p>

safe through the Cuban Missile Crisis. I felt safe during the Vietnam War 
(despite the domino theory), once I realized I wasn't going there myself. 
When Kissinger did his grisly work, I felt safe. Even when I went to the 
Watts riots with the National Guard in the late Sixties, I felt safe enough 
to empty the bullets from my M16 and my bandoleer, resolving not to spend 
my time on earth killing anyone. I felt safe during all the years of 
American support for dictators in South America. When ordinary Guatemalans 
were being dropped from helicopters into the mouths of roiling volcanos, I 
felt safe. What did it have to do with me? When Timorese were being 
slaughtered, I felt safe. When children were dying in Rwanda, I felt safe.</font></p>

but the noise of high-flying warplanes.  On wings of desire the
innocents fly also&#133;sad spirals.  Fallen workers, each one a hero for
doing the necessary, marching through this life to perpetuate a dream of
love, to perpetuate a struggle.  Every moment spent working is a moment
spent nobly, not only in self-edification but most often for the love of
others&#133;for those left behind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Danger in the workplace varies wildly according to occupation with taxi
drivers regularly occupying first place and police officers and fire
fighters close behind.  To be struck down during selfless endeavor at
our moment of innocence and altruism is the most extreme brutality, a
crime against the solidarity of humanity.  No religion can ever carry
souls to this level of purity and no religion dare try.  If a creator
has given us truly free will then no deed this evil can ever be done in
God&#146;s name.  In whose name are these things done?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these days our planet&#146;s various vengeful deities have unleashed such
horrors one wishes merely for the formula, the incantation that would
return these cruel genies to their bottles.  Christians are throwing
bottles at the little girls of rival Christian sects in Northern
Ireland.  Semitic Jews refuse the most basic human rights for Semitic
Palestinians, like voting and property rights, and even international
monitors who could stop the bloodshed in the Middle East (and much of
the world?) immediately.  India&#146;s saffron fascists are dealing
internationally to downgrade their brutal caste system into something
less than racism (tradition&#133;the untouchables actually benefited).  The
Christian government of the US refuses to consider reparations or
apologies for slavery (tradition&#133;the slaves actually benefited).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When reading the apologetics of the white Baptist church in the southern
US, the biblical underpinnings of racism, one is reminded of Pakistani
intellectual Irfan Husain writing recently in these pages of sexism
among Afghanistan&#146;s Taliban: &#147;Their grasp of religion is based on a
literal interpretation of poorly understood texts, and there is a
tendency to ascribe ancient tribal customs to Islam. Thus, the
traditional place accorded to women in a very backward tribal society
has acquired all the weight and solemnity of religious dogma.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My nine-year old son, shocked by the news rocking the East coast, asked
me why this was happening.  I wanted to tell him about religions and a
horribly unequal and unjust world that our country seems to sit astride
proudly but stopped myself.  For this horror, for all these lives and
promises, there can be no reason&#133;or that the reason is a name so
terrible it should not be spoken.</font></p>

when the market was secondary to ordinary people's lives and concerns.
Now, it seems, we must all hear of the plight of the markets before we
hear of the immediate human needs of our fellows, and commiserate,
first, with the markets and its corporate members in their suffering.  </font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of us may be just getting used to the reality that we will
carry the scars of the events of September 11th, 2001 for the rest of our 
lives. The misery and horror that &quot;doesn't happen here&quot; has happened here - 
in the here-est part of here.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The smoke has not yet cleared, and it will not for some time. I think we 
need to be extremely cautious and sensitive about people's feelings. The 
number of people worldwide who knew someone in the Pentagon, Twin Towers, 
rescue crews or airplanes who didn't make it may be in the millions. No 
amount of aspirin will heal this excruciating pain in a short time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If progressives are to take a position on this matter, we must champion 
peace. We should state openly that we condemn terrorism and the killing of 
thousands of innocent people roundly - whether it is by hijackers of planes 
or Israel and the United States. From here it is less hard to see that the 
understandable angry motivation to a military strike really does not benefit 
us. Mass violence and terror on the part of the U.S. will only beget more 
mass violence and terror on the other side, and we will not stop terrorism 
by stooping to the level of the terrorists themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Ariel Sharon and other terrorists and war 
criminals either are or have been bankrolled by the United States at one 
time (bin Laden was bankrolled in the Afghan war in the 1980s by the U.S.). 
The lesson to draw from this is that the United States government, in trying 
to construct a global empire and conquer the world, will always have some of 
its friends turn sour on it when U.S. imperial interests collide with those 
of our &quot;friends&quot;. From this, one can see that a military strike will not 
stop terrorism, and war or martial law will only lead to the damaging of 
more lives everywhere. This is the progressive argument for peace that we 
should be making - that we will not stoop to the level of mass murderers in 
order to accomplish nothing. Besides, after the horrifying things that have 
happened, I'm sure there's a space in people's hearts next to their 
understandable feelings of anger and revenge for some peace in this truly 
awful hell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake of this tragedy, cooler heads may not always prevail. We will 
face a ravenous media and right wing which will hamper our efforts to get a 
progressive argument through sometimes. But give the dust time to clear, and 
in the coming months, when people will be more able to discuss this subject 
with equanimity, an argument for peace which firmly opposes terrorism as 
well may be able to win back the moral initiative to the progressive cause. 
Don't forget, we still have a president who walked out on the World 
Conference Against Racism, the Kyoto Protocol and the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty. Though it will take time, this too shall pass. Let us be sober but 
not defeated.</font></p>

Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Seoul, Hanoi, Baghdad, and Belgrade.  September 11 
should serve as a wakeup call--not to the latent militarism within all of 
us but to the courageous nonviolence Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., 
taught.  We now know what it feels like to suffer undeserved violence.  Let 
us remember this feeling when deciding how to go forward as a nation and as

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What occurred this morning, and what apparently is still unfolding ranks 
among the most despicable, monstrously wicked events of this or any Century.  
The evil attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and plane crashes 
apparently near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and possibly even Camp David will 
forever change the way Americans view internal security. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are too many events unfolding, so for now I will simply put forth some 
random thoughts to be commented upon at a later date:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.  There may be thousands dead and certainly thousands injured, making this 
a Pearl Harbor-scale attack.  This is an utterly insane attack that will 
outrage this nation the way Pearl Harbor did.  And remember that that attack 
nearly sixty years ago was avenged with two nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, respectively.  The Japanese learned a brutal lesson that you do not 
attack the US, and even though Hawaii was at the time a colony, not a state, 
several hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens lost their lives and their 
government was smashed.  America's fury has no rival.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.  We must mourn the loss of so many innocent lives and at the same time 
realize that these monstrously wicked and vile attacks are the result of a 
foreign policy that for too long has ignored much of the world.  The US 
government, and by implication, the American people can not continue to act 
as if the rest of the world does not matter.  Our one-sided support for 
Israel, our walking out on the Kyoto Agreement, the Durban Conference on 
Racism, the ABM Treaty, and numerous other examples has not only isolated the 
US from the rest of the world, but has served as a clarion call that we 
simply insist on being an arrogant and intentionally ignorant society.  
Today, that ignorance came back at us in the form of massive hatred and 
violence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.  The President's proposed National Missile Defense system (NMD) could not 
and would not have been able to thwart such an attack.  We may soon spend 
hundreds of billions on a system that not only will create another 
destructively wasteful arms race with Russia and China, but that will also 
leave us with an illusion of safety.  Those of us who oppose NMD do so from a 
motive of patriotic concern for the nation's genuine security.  We are 
motivated also by the realization that such a useless, wasteful program will 
squander our resources and trigger a deadly arms race.  Finally, since I am 
both a student and teacher of history, I am aware of previous unsuccessful 
attempts by other nations to defend their territories.  France's Maginot Line 
and China's Great Wall come to mind, respectively.  National Missile Defense 
will amount to another hare-brained scheme, a modern day whiz-bang, high-tech 
Maginot Line utterly incapable from halting attacks like the ones today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. This terror attack also marks a Titantic-sized failure on the part of the 
FAA to provide airline security.  The idea of turning over airline security 
to private industry is sheer madness.  The only thing being &quot;turned over&quot; 
under such a system are the airport security personnel whose turn-over rates 
range from 200 percent at Boston's Logan Airport, where two of the ill-fated 
planes were hijacked, to 90 percent at Dulles Airport, scene of another 
fateful hijacking today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.  We may add to the failure list the FBI, NSA, CIA, and Department of 
Defense.  Where were they?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6.  The anti-Arab and anti-Islamic Witch Hunt will now reach a fever pitch.  
We can rest assure that there will be a wave of the most hateful, anti-Arab 
hysteria that will sweep this nation.  While this is the darkest day for 
America since December 7, 1941, American Arabs will soon face a backlash not 
suffered by any American minority since the Nisei (Japanese Americans) were 
targeted and eventually interned in 1941-1942, and remained interned for the 
duration of the Second World War.  It is dark day to be an American Arab.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.  CBS Network News earlier today showed film footage of Palestinians 
dancing and celebrating in the streets.  While it is true that Arafat and 
seemingly all leading Palestinian figures have condemned the attacks, the 
scene of  some Palestinians celebrating this deed is not only a horribly 
disgusting scene, but another example of how America has so badly alienated 
herself from Palestinians that such celebrations are made possible.  The 
video tape footage no doubt will be used to strike another hard blow against 
Palestinians.  Some Palestinians and Arabs' ignorance of Public Relations and 
of how to sway American hearts and minds absolutely boggles the mind.  I have 
heard some say this before: &quot;When Allah was handing out diplomas and degrees 
in Public Relations apparently not a single Arab was in line.&quot;  This harmful 
little maxim gained momentum today. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cause of Palestinian Justice may well have died today along with 
thousands of innocent lives and America's sense of security.  Making the case 
of Palestine to the American people has now become a million times more 
difficult.

Although there were plenty of comments about how this brought out the best in Americans, I saw plenty of the worst brought out, too.  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gasoline prices got jacked-up in order to gouge consumers after prices had already skyrocketed this year.  Cars lined up outside of stations in my small town, creating traffic jams and danger on the roads.  I heard second-hand of fistfights at the gas pumps.

No.  Did they even mention oil refineries closing down?  No.  I don&#146;t know if they did or didn&#146;t.  If it was just a rumor, it was certainly enough to send prices up for the oil companies.  Did you see anything about corporations putting up barricades at their headquarters and increasing security?  I didn&#146;t.  I can&#146;t help but wonder if the media silence is complicity in masking the first steps towards martial law being declared.

violence we have shown the world.  America can only push the world so hard 
before it pushes back.  To quote Bruce Cockburn:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;If I had a rocket launcher...someone would pay.<br>
If I had a rocket launcher...I would not hesitate.<br>
If I had a rocket launcher...I would retaliate.<br>
If I had a rocket launcher...some son of a bitch would die.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Someone found a rocket launcher today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the saddest thing about today is the innocent victims who died.  No 
doubt, those who perpetrated the acts were aiming at those who they believed 
had killed and undermined them or those they support.  But it's the men in 
the shadows who make the decisions of this sort, who order the deaths, who 
accept collateral damage, who initiate violence...&quot;<i>they are never the ones 
to fight or to die</i>&quot; -Jackson Browne.  And suppose we retaliate against 
Afghanistan or whomever, the members of the Taliban or the small sect of 
violent extremists who perpetrate the violent actions will not die either.  
It will once again be the faceless civilians who are forced into war by a 
dictatorship.  If America really stands for freedom, we will not send our 
innocent into war to kill other innocent people, but rather expose those in 
our own government and other governments who condone terrorism and accept 
the deaths of millions.  Why are they never the ones to lose their lives?</font></p>

 <br>
While listening to National Public Radio most of the day, many people interview mentioned the notion of retaliation and retribution, always in the form of swift violent responses. What does this achieve?<br>
 <br>
The casualties will be accounted for once the rubble is searched.  I am not minimizing their deaths, in no sense at all, however, those who really hurt at this moment are the survivors - those who lost parents, friends, childrens, wives, husbands, companions, etc.   <br>
 <br>
If the US retaliates with violence, will the result not be the same - in that families and friendships will be displaced and destroyed in another place.  We need to internalize this prior to professing violent retaliation.<br>
 <br>
Surely, two wrongs do not make a right.  Retaliation should come forth in the form of restraint first, national reflection, foreign policy review, peaceful negotiation, and consideration of viable alternatives for preserving freedom and peace. </font></p>
