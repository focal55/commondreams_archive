Best Defense System is a Sustainable, Just World</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forgive me for describing my personal feelings at a time when all Americans are supposed to be sharing the same collective feelings.  I do this not to appear self-absorbed, but to make a point.  Perhaps you can empathize.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Four-or five days before Tuesday&#146;s horrific attacks, I woke up in the morning with a sense of melancholy and sadness  nothing unusual.  There was no tragedy in my life at that time, no overtly imminent threat.  As I so often do, I reproached myself for feeling this way.  What right do I have to feel unhappy?  I have a solid marriage, a healthy 7-month-old daughter.  Though I am not rich, I am not greedy or materialistic and have more than enough possessions (I wish I could get rid of some stuff).  I would prefer to make a living as a jazz music composer, but my scientific job is comfortable, and in some ways rewarding.  I am in good health.  Many people in this country and around the world would very quickly trade places with me. How spoiled and ingratious I should feel for being unhappy.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But wait a minute  for all in my life that I hold dear, a voice inside of me continually says &#147;Be prepared to suffer.&#148;  Paranoia?  No, the awareness of being a collaborator in an unsustainable way of life.  If I had to put my finger on one word which describes my omnipresent uneasiness, it is this: unsustainability.  Our comforts and way of life are built on a castle of sand.  Everything we do and enjoy is financed by a growing mountain of economic, material, environmental, and spiritual debt.  Our country uses 75% of the world&#146;s resources and demands a larger percentage.  We exploit more and more of the environment, the world&#146;s people and our own citizens to get less and less of what little remains.  We try to protect ourselves against the increasing anger of the people we exploit by devoting more resources to military and police power, only to find out as we did on September 11th that an anger a person is willing to die for is stronger than the fear of the military or the police.  We silence, dismiss, and arrest those who call for changes in our lifestyle, those changes needed to make sure that all people are given an opportunity to enjoy the basic necessities of life and that our fragile environment is protected.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As most on this proclaimed day of prayer, Friday, September 14, will be praying to God for the victims, but then wishing for swift and violent retribution for the attackers, I will be looking in the mirror and asking the God of a sustainable and just world, &#147;what do I need to change or give up to break the cycle of environmental, social, and economic decay?&#148;  Tell me and I will do it.  What do I need to change or give up to make sure everyone around the world can achieve the basic necessities of life?  For people to run their own affairs and enterprises without economic and environmental exploitation from multi-national corporations?  For people to save the last wild places, refuges of nature&#146;s innocence which are needed to cleanse our spirits?  What do I need to change or give up to protect us from the effects of global warming, deforestation, draining of the aquifers, loss of topsoil, polluting of our air and water, the extinction of our animal and plant diversity?  What do I need to change or give up to make sure all races and nationalities have an equal opportunity to use their intellectual and creative potential for the good of the world?  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent editorial by a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist stated that the worst thing we as a people can do right now is pause, or hesitate, and ask ourselves whether we are even partially responsible for sowing seeds that create conditions of hatred and anger leading to attacks like those on Tuesday.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would counter by saying that this is the BEST thing we can do. By recognizing where each of us is placed in a link of the chain which perpetuates violence, hatred, and injustice, we can help break the chain and prevent such further attacks. </font></p>

My sleep is disturbed by disjointed nightmares. I wake to more news that is the same. Surprisingly, I realize that now that we don't have sports to distract us, we need them to give us little, temporary loyalties that don't hurt anyone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    I think I know why they bombed us with our own passenger airplanes. That doesn't make me like or approve. Surely, someone of the generals and journalists and politicians who give us so many aerial views or reports of our own bombs in other places can see that killing and destruction do hurt if you are on the ground receiving them. Maybe that is why most of them do not seem to think about it?</font></p>

Thanks to Heiderose Kober (9/14/01 12:16 AM) for pointing to Michael Lerner's homily.  Thanks to Emilie Nichols (9/14/01 6:16 PM) for all the good referrals.  From links on the Sojourner's site in her list, I would further recommend: <br>
    <a href="http://www.ecapc.org/terrorism.asp" target="_new">http://www.ecapc.org/terrorism.asp</a> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two most important American books of the last half century were Bertram Gross's &quot;Friendly Fascism&quot; and Joseph Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot;.  I've read Gross's book twice, understand it only dimly, but know he is saying something very important -- it is already here, and we allow it because we fail to recognize it.  Meanwhile, Heller beautifully follows Mel Brooks's advice to fight fascists with the weapon they fear most -- laughter.  For a timely example, see the chapter titled &quot;Captain Black&quot;, the story of the Great Loyalty Oath Crusade. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The deaths and grave injuries on Tuesday fill us with deep melancholy.  But sadder still would be to respond to terrorism by curtailing democracy and fulfilling Gross's prophecies.  This would let the terrorists inflict even greater damage than they could have imagined. </font></p>

 While it is true that our policies in the Middle East, namely our unconditional support for Israel against the Palestinians have caused the US and Americans in general to be despised by many Arabs and Muslims, this cowardly assault on civilians here in America carries with it the condemnation of the entire world. This attack will NOT be tolerated by the US, nor by the majority of the world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will be the forum for many changes: Americans will not feel as safe as they once did, and we will face more security restrictions as we travel. However, hopefully it will also be a time where we all pay closer attention to our country's policies, as the Reagan administration gave aid to this monster bin Laden and it seems that he has helped to fully arm a monster that has despised us even when we were arming him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We must now fully go after the people who attacked our citizens in our own homeland, and any country that harbors men such as these who launched their cowardly attack on Tuesday will be grouped with them and will face our response. This is the right thing to do, as we have been violated in our own country in a most savage and cowardly manner, where our own planes and our civilians aboard were used as guided missiles against our own cities. I have put partisanship aside and stand with our leaders and our American people, seeking justice on all fronts. I want the people and, if necessary, the brutal Taliban government brought to justice for these attacks, and I also want to see Americans paying closer attention to how our aid goes to spread misery in places like the West Bank. There are many dead Palestinian children killed by the Israelis who are just as innocent as our American children killed on Tuesday, and I think we should terminate all military aid to Israel. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am against all wrongs, no matter where they are carried our, or by whom. America is a strong country, and we will prevail against this despicable act of terrorism carried out in our own homeland. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What harm we do to others will come back to haunt us two fold,
unfortunately it often takes down those innocent among us.  Our
governments both past and present have caused great harm to others, we
as citizens are, more often than not, the innocents.  Those are the
thoughts that ran through my head as I watched the horror unfold.  I was
not surprised that such an act was carried out (it seemed eerily like a
plot out of a Hollywood movie) but more so at the magnitude of it.  No
one deserves to die like that...my heart also goes out to my Arab and
Muslim friends (being one doesn't mean being the other) for I imagine
they fear retaliation and abuse just for being, as our friends and loved
ones died just for being.   My heart also goes out to all the Americans,
Canadians, Australians, Japanese etc.. who lost their lives in this
horrendous acts, less we forget that, though this attack took place on
American soil it has impacted greatly on many of us from around the
world.</font></p>

I could add.  I remembered a book I had recently purchased - Simply Living,
The Spirit of the Indigenous People - randomly flipped it open and as fate
would have it, found these two quotes: </font></p>

not your mode.  Westerners often ignore this truth.  We have survived a long
time in a world where survival is very difficult, and we learned how to do
it.  When the blizzard lashes out at us, only a fool tries to face it and
struggle with its power.  But only a fool abandons himself to it and lets it
blow him where it will.  The wise man leans against it and lets it push him
slowly, slowly, so he can pick his path and find his way to safety.&quot;</i>  Simeon

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We face the blizzard now each one of us.  I

we speak out to our leaders.  I pray we don't participate in their calls for
vengeance.  I pray for understanding, justice and peace.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you for offering this forum.  While I feel fortunate to be born and 
raised an American who currently lives in the Rocky Mountain region, where I 
camp and take in the awesome beauty of a still-pristine land; and while I am 
heartsick over the sudden and horrific death that rained down on New York, 
Washington and Pennsylvania... most of my thoughts are concentrated on the &quot;what comes next&quot; aspect of this drama.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sadly, I see only more horrific 
death, mutilation and otherwise gratuitous violence, which will engender more 
hatred and violence against our government and people.  Until the <i>core issues</i> 
that led to this tragic moment are addressed and given a true chance at 
resolution -- and by <i>core issues</i> I am referring mainly to the oppressive 
foreign policy paradigm of a corporate-driven elitist agenda, which 
marginalizes and disempowers the vast majority of humanity -- I really see no 
hope for Planet Earth and its living inhabitants.  The optimist in me views 
this as a turning point, where Americans will wake up from their consumerist 
slumber, change their priorities in such as way as to include the rest of the 
globe in a rise to prosperity and equality, and save the world before it's 
too late.  The pragmatist in me, however, suspects that any resistance to the &quot;manufactured consent&quot; of an angry nation crying for retribution is an 
exercise in futility.  </font></p>

military response does not spiral into mutual and total destruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of us are &quot;jumping up and down with joy on the corpses of the world 
trade center,&quot; as one outraged contributor to the Common Dreams forum put it 
-- but I  can understand the impulse that led them to write such a thing.  
Many (though by no means all) of the posts to this forum really do come off 
sounding as if &quot;I told you so&quot; and even worse, &quot;when you get down to it, not 
that I'm condoning violence, but . .  . serves them right&quot; lurked between the 
lines.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    I was sickened and shamed by the news that some Americans have carried 
out small-scale, local acts of &quot;retribution&quot; against innocent people, by the 
references, already, to &quot;those people&quot; and their crazed, murderous ways -- 
but I was not surprised.  This, though, this has me shocked, that whatever 
the (doubtless achingly sympathetic) intent behind such messages,  there 
would be even the appearance of such moral shortsightedness and callousness.
    Now is not a time conducive to clear thinking, as shown by both kinds of 
forum responses.  And _of course_ it is necessary to understand the history 
and motivations behind this horror, in order to respond correctly both now 
and for the future -- a necessity which is not likely to be addressed by the 
mainstream news  adequately, or at all.  I just would like to say two things:
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    At this point the chance that this was a homegrown horror seem 
vanishingly small.   However, when that still remained a possibility, I read 
posts which (responsibly) reminded us not to jump to conclusions (a la the 
imaginary swarthy men of Oklahoma City) while castigating the U.S. for the 
international oppression which brought about this nightmare.  This is both 
illogical and morally untruthful, and generally unbecoming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    It is important to understand what lies behind such hideous acts.  For 
example, Faisal Bodi pointed out (as one can read in the &quot;Terrorism Through 
Lens ...&quot; article on this site) that &quot;inside America, the trade center, the 
Pentagon, Camp David and Capitol Hill are all seen as symbols of global U.S. 
power and prestige, of the triumph of democracy. Outside, in the Muslim 
world, they are popularly regarded as symbols of terror and oppression.&quot;   It 
is these sorts of insights that should be on the tv alongside reports of 
cheering Palestinians.  We must offer, through all available channels, every 
piece of evidence, every argument suggesting that such evil doesn't just fall 
from the sky like a meteorite in a Discovery Channel dinosaur special.  This 
seems the only alternative to incomprehension or worse, an all-too simplified 
understanding, dangerously prone to be rallied behind ill-planned or 
downright immoral reactions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    And yet, we must not forget:  it's not about symbols. I live in 
Poughkeepsie, some 70-odd miles up the Hudson from New York, an area where 
many people ride  a Metro-North train down to jobs in the city every weekday. 
 The children who went to school these last few days just not knowing what 
happened to their mother or father, the downstairs neighbors whose son is a 
NYC firefighter (thankfully, they just heard from him yesterday) -- they're 
not frantic over symbols.  It was not symbols who died.  It was not symbols 
who were killed.  We must keep this in the front of our thoughts and 
responses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
    Most of us who visit Common Dreams have in our hearts a heavy burden of 
atrocities and injustices,  more even then the vicious world gives us as our 
birthright.  This is a necessary thing, but I think sometimes it might be too 
heavy to safely carry, day after day, without causing a kind of damage, 
however subtle.  One of the things about terrorism, we are finding out all 
too clearly, is how it spreads out to poison the every-day -- one very minor 
example:  the boxcutter I use everyday at my job in a bookstore is now simply 
un-usable.  Ideology, I think, no matter how noble an ideology, can have a 
very similar character.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Pragmatically, any messages sent out with even the hint of such a tone, like 
one letter I saw  recently in the local newspaper, is worse than useless in terms of anything besides preaching to the converted, probably helping only to 
turn people way from consideration into blind patriotism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personally, we must ask ourselves -- what does this makes us?  What kind of 
people are we being?</font></p>

leads me to fear how this would be enacted.
Our own Revolutionary War utilized tactics
that were then considered an abomination to
all civility, an unprecedented breach of conduct,
much as these terrorist actions have been
described by us today.  Humility and deep
consideration is called for as we figure out
how to proceed and what kind of society we
want to live in and inflict on the rest of the
world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, regarding our immediate response,
we know that these actions, however heinous,
do not appear in a vacuum.  We trained Bin
Laden.  We have a history with the Taliban.
We have supported and trained and provided
weapons to countless rebel groups in the name
of our immediate goals, and consistently we
have abandoned them after setting them up.
Repeatedly we act for short term goals without
the kind of consideration for the &quot;innocent&quot;
people involved and impacted by our decisions
that we want people to have for us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the only way we can appropriately respond
to these heinous acts and avenge the sad and
horrible deaths of so many innocent people is
to return the favor and retaliate militarily
(as opposed to legally) against any people or
places possibly involved -- how are we
different from Belfast?  Where is our high
and mighty horse from which we advise
others who face death and destruction and
fear?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I urge you to be a voice for moderation, for
consideration, for reflection.  I urge you to
use this as an opportunity for increased
communication and understanding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I do not feel reassured by a unified government
behind acts that continue the cycle of violence.
We have inflicted violence in the past.  And now
we have experienced it in our world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us celebrate our response and the outpouring
of support and courage of the rescue workers,
of the people pouring out to give blood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please represent the people in the U.S. who,
like me, grieve deeply for the tragedy but
feel it of the utmost importance to not
succumb to anger.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With greatest respect,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More random thoughts in the wake of Tuesday....
I write these words with no particular knowledge or expertise in
politics or history or foreign policy. I am not an expert in anything. I just write from the heart. Take it for what it's worth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am becoming afraid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm not afraid of terrorists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am afraid for the future of my children.
<br>
I am afraid that the United States of America no longer exists,
at least not as it did prior to the attack on New York and Washington.
<br>
I am afraid that we will be all too willing to sacrifice our freedom
in order create a sense of security. 
<br>
I am afraid that my ability
to freely travel will be greatly inhibited.
<br>
I am afraid that a sense of paranoia will overtake this country
like nothing we have ever seen.
<br>
I am afraid that we will be more
suspicious than ever before
of anyone who speaks with an accent, especially an accent that sounds
Middle Eastern.
<br>
I am afraid that we will not trust anyone who doesn't look like an&quot;American&quot;. (whatever that means)
<br>
I am afraid that mainstream Americans will become even more intolerant
of ideas and philosophies that
are deemed even remotely &quot;un-American&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even now I'm uncomfortable when
I speak with acquaintances and co-workers about my left leaning
politics. Do I dare suggest in public that I embrace some beliefs which
might be deemed &quot;socialistic&quot;?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than anything, I believe this country needs to look inward. We need to seriously examine ourselves
and ask what we did to arrive at this point in history. What policies
and actions have we undertaken on the world stage that would cause
another group of people to harbor so much hatred toward us? The events
of this week were not created in a vacuum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And now I am afraid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these minutes my stomach is not yet in a knot, although my heart is

of Islamic men. No young men from here dead and in a bag home. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've been watching from Germany how people in the United States have absolutely no intellectual
framework for understanding recent events (or any other event, for that matter).  The second they turn to the bombings, they are utterly lacking in the ability to understand it historically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had some nuts ask me today if I <i>supported</i> the airliner bombings, presumably on the basis of my having warned about the dangers of letting the media dehistoricize the bombings by pretending that they came out of nowhere.  This stuff is incredible.  It's to do the unthinkable thing of asking me if I actually support the unthinkable.<i>  (Yes, I supported the airliner bombings -- just as I support the destruction of the planet Earth by super aliens from Outer Space.)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's like the kind of madness we keep seeing among the New Humanitarians.  The NHs claim to be in favor of the right of &quot;humanitarian&quot; intervention (i.e., warmaking in the name humanitarianism) in cases where
human rights atrocities are exceptionally egregious.  And yet they never call on any &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to bomb the United States based on its decades of egregious conduct abroad.  Thank goodness they don't, but they are congenitally incapable of understanding the sheer hypocrisy of the principle to which they allegedly adhere.</font></p>
