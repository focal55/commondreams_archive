    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - August 24 - Missouri River barges have little or no impact on
    rates charged by railroads to move goods anywhere near the river, according to a study
    released today by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). The report contradicts the
    findings of a study prepared for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that claimed railroads
    lower their rates greatly as a result of competition from shipping on the Missouri River. <br>
    <br>
    The report's author, Dr. Phillip Baumel, Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in
    Agriculture at Iowa State University, also found that the region's farmers would probably
    benefit more if water used for occasional barges on the Missouri River were instead saved
    and used to float barges on the Mississippi River below St. Louis during droughts.
    Mississippi River barging does result in significant transportation benefits to farmers. <br>
    <br>
    Missouri River barges have carried an annual average of only around 1.5 million tons of
    commercial traffic, compared to almost 100 million tons carried on the Mississippi River
    below St. Louis. According to an earlier study by Dr. Baumel, the Missouri River carries
    less than 2% of the grain exported from any of the states it serves (Iowa, Nebraska,
    Kansas and Missouri). According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Missouri River
    provides annual economic benefits of less than $10 million per year, compared to $1.3
    billion generated by the Missouri River for other industries, including recreation. <br>
    <br>
    Despite this fact, navigation advocates have claimed that the potential competition of
    river barges forces railroads to lower their rates in ways that benefit farmers along the
    Missouri River. The report prepared for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated that
    railroads lowered rail rates roughly $200 million per year. <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Baumel's review of this report concluded that it was fundamentally flawed. &quot;The
    report is sufficiently flawed that it provides no evidence to refute the common sense
    notion that barge traffic on the Missouri River is so small that railroads almost
    certainly ignore it. Rail rates are based almost entirely on competition with other
    railroads, and, in recent years, on the ability of farmers to truck their corn and
    soybeans directly to the Mississippi River or to local corn milling plants and
    feedlots.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The flaws with the report to the Army Corps start with the basic data,&quot; said
    Dr. Baumel. &quot;The study used deliberately coded reports of rail rates that cannot be
    used without a key to the code, which the authors simply did not have. They then
    arbitrarily rejected more than two thirds of the data. There is good reason to believe
    that much of the remaining data are equally unreliable.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Baumel's report also found that the conclusions of the report conflict with the
    conclusion of another Corps report, backed by Corps of Engineers' traffic data, which
    found that the amount of grain taken by barge down the Missouri River is fixed by the
    amount of fertilizer brought up the river. This fact means railroads provide no meaningful
    competition to railroads for grain, in contrast to the findings of the report that grain
    shipments provided two thirds of the alleged benefits. &quot;Use of the Missouri River is
    only likely to decline in the future because of the rapid growth of direct railing of
    grain to the west coast, to local feedlots and to other destinations that could not use
    the river,&quot; added Dr. Baumel. <br>
    <br>
    By contrast, Dr. Baumel's review summarizes some of the critical problems faced by farmers
    when the Mississippi River below St. Louis runs shallow, which can bottle up three times
    as much commerce in a month as the Missouri River carries in a year and more than double
    barge rates. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Army Corps of Engineers has indicated that water from the Missouri River could
    be used to help keep barges moving on the Mississippi River at critical times if it were
    not used up to support barges on the Missouri River,&quot; said Dr. Baumel. &quot;The
    region and the Army Corps should take a hard look at the trade-off because it would
    probably be of real benefit to farmers.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is studying new ways of managing water on the Missouri
    River. EDF has advocated that it eliminate efforts to stabilize flows for Missouri River
    navigation because of the great potential alternative uses of that water for the
    environment and far vaster economic uses including river- based recreation and Mississippi
    River navigation. <br>
    <br>
    The Environmental Defense Fund, a leading national, NY-based nonprofit organization,
    represents 300,000 members. EDF links science, economics, and law to create innovative,
    equitable and economically viable solutions to today's environmental problems.<p align="center">###</td>
