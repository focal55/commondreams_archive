    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 23&nbsp; - The American Public Health Association
    today urged Congress to approve legislation that will protect patients seeking medical
    care and guarantee access and quality services to those enrolled in managed care programs.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Managed care has the promise to provide quality, comprehensive and affordable
    coverage to all Americans enrolled in managed care plans,&quot; said Mohammad N. Akhter,
    MD, MPH, executive director of the American Public Health Association. &quot;Now that most
    Americans are enrolled in these plans, many are unable to access the necessary quality
    care, are losing their choice of health care providers and are lacking information about
    health plans.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Over the years, physicians have been strong advocates of patients, providing the
    best care based on the best available science,&quot; said Akhter. &quot;With managed care,
    profits and cost-savings have come between the patient and the physician/health care
    provider.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Congress must act now to protect patients and approve standards that will guide
    managed care organizations in the delivery of health care and at the same time will tell
    the American public their rights as they decide on a health care provider,&quot; he said.
    &quot;The Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998 is an important first step.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The American Public Health Association, the oldest and largest organization of public
    health professionals, represents more than 50,000 members from over 50 public health
    occupations. Managed care will be the theme of APHA's 126th Annual Meeting, November
    15-19, 1998, in Washington, DC.<p align="center">###</td>
