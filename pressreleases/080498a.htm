    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 4 - The House is scheduled to vote today on the
    Hefley Amendment&nbsp; to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill which seeks to
    overturn President Clinton's May 28th executive order banning workplace discrimination
    based on sexual orientation.&nbsp; The passage of this bill would go against public
    opinion which recent polls show is overwhelmingly in favor of job protection for gay
    Americans, according to the Human Rights Campaign.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is a flagrant bid to placate
    religious political extremists who have threatened to leave the GOP unless they adopt more
    strident positions on social issues.&nbsp; The Hefley Amendment is indicative of the
    stranglehold the Far Right currently has over certain elements of the GOP,&quot; said HRC
    executive director Elizabeth Birch.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A vote for the Hefley Amendment is a vote
    for legalizing discrimination, which most Americans adamantly oppose.&nbsp; Republicans,
    Democrats, and independents in Congress do not want to add the official stamp of approval
    for anti-gay workplace discrimination in federal <br>
    agencies,&quot; said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hefley amendment, sponsored by Rep. Joel
    Hefley (R-CO), is not in line with public opinion. A new poll released by HRC and
    conducted by the polling firm Penn, Schoen, and Berland shows 64 percent of Americans said
    they are against Congress overturning the executive order, compared to only 28 percent who
    support overturning the discrimination ban. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released
    last week reaffirms the HRC findings with 72 percent of the American public supporting
    President Clinton's Executive Order against anti-gay bias in federal agencies.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An April, 1997 poll conducted for the Human
    Rights Campaign by the Tarrance Group, shows that eighty percent of the American public
    says that homosexuals should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this executive order was issued, many
    federal agencies had their own separate policies banning discrimination based on sexual
    orientation.&nbsp; This often led to confusion amongst government workers as to whether or
    not they were protected.&nbsp; Contrary to the claims of the GOP leadership, this
    executive order helps clarify the law for government workers by bringing uniformity to
    existing anti-discrimination policies across the federal government.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order adds sexual orientation to the list
    of protected categories for which discrimination is already prohibited, i.e., race, color,
    religion, sex, national origin, handicap and age. In issuing the order, Clinton noted that
    this policy does not add any new enforcement <br>
    rights, such as the ability of a civilian federal worker to appeal an anti-gay job
    discrimination case before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's
    largest national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the
    country, effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public
    to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work,
    and in the community. <p align="center">- 30 -</td>
