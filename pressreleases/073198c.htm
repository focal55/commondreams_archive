    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 31 - The White House Council of Economic Advisors
    (CEA) released a report today that exposed the Administration's plans to abandon any real
    domestic emissions reductions in favor of simply buying &quot;paper reductions&quot; from
    other countries. <p>The much anticipated report on the economic impacts of implementing
    the Kyoto Protocol starkly contrasts recent speeches by both the President and Vice
    President suggesting the Administration was ready to position the United States to take
    responsibility for reducing the 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions the U.S. emits each
    year. </p>
    <p>&quot;The Administration's approach is the same one used by northerners during the
    Civil War who paid poor people to fight for them,&quot; remarked John Passacantando,
    Executive Director of Ozone Action. &quot;We made real commitments to reduce our emissions
    of greenhouse gases. The Administration should be releasing plans for how to make those
    reductions domestically&quot; </p>
    <p>Under the Kyoto Protocol, the U.S. committed to reducing emissions 7% below 1990 level
    by 2008-2012. The scenario favored by the CEA calls for 85% of those reductions to be
    achieved abroad and simply purchased by the U.S. Using this scenario, the CEA estimates
    the costs of reducing emissions at $200 per U.S. household or $20 billion per year. The
    Clinton/Gore approach is insufficient for addressing the threat of global climate change
    in at least three ways: </p>
    <p>1) <b>The plan sacrifices U.S. competitiveness and national security. </b>The world's
    economies are shifting increasingly towards low-emission, energy efficient technologies.
    By not reducing emissions at home, U.S. businesses will have less incentive to deploy
    innovative technologies, falling behind the rest of the world and remaining dependent on
    foreign oil. </p>
    <p>2) <b>The plan is an embarrassment to the U.S. internationally. </b>Developing nations
    have insisted they will not participate in the Kyoto agreement until they see
    industrialized countries like the U.S. take steps to reduce their emissions domestically.
    This plan is a clear indication to China, Brazil and India that we have no intention to
    reduce emissions at home. </p>
    <p>3) <b>The plan will result in cleaner air abroad than at home. </b>U.S. dollars will be
    used to invest in clean energy and transportation projects in other countries, while dirty
    power plants and factories in our own cities will continue to pollute our air and
    negatively impact public health. </p>
    <p>A successful emissions reductions plan must call for the U.S. to achieve a substantial
    majority of our emissions cuts at home. Anything less is both irresponsible and
    ineffective. &quot;The current proposal reveals a fatal weakness of this Administration.
    It must never have intended to deliver on the Kyoto promises through domestic
    action,&quot; noted Passacantando. </p>
