    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 15 - The report of the Rumsfeld Commission established
    by Congress to assess the ballistic missile threat to the United States makes a case why a
    ballistic missile threat to the United States could develop more quickly than had been
    anticipated by the intelligence community.<br>
    <br>
    With little doubt, proponents of national missile defense deployment will seize upon the
    report to advocate quick deployment of a defensive missile system.<br>
    <br>
    There are major flaws in the proponents' case, however; most notably, the U.S. has not
    been able to develop a workable missile defense system after 40 years of trying and
    spending $108 billion.<br>
    <br>
    The Republican quest for a national missile defense is all too reminiscent of France's
    building of the Maginot Line against a resurgent German army. <br>
    <br>
    National Missile Defense remains a bad idea whose time has not come:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127; Whatever the threat, after more than 40 years, the U.S. still has not been
    able to develop a workable defensive missile system against medium or long-range missiles.
    &nbsp; Recent testing of missile defenses has produced only four successes out of 18
    tries.&nbsp; This failure to develop an effective missile defense comes despite spending
    some $108 billion since the program was first conceived four decades ago.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127;The Pentagon continues to develop a National Missile Defense in a hasty
    process that the Welch panel in February 1998 called &quot;a rush to failure&quot; and
    which the General Accounting Office last month labeled &quot;high risk&quot; [see quote on
    next page]<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127; While it may have been difficult to know in advance that the Indian's were
    testing underground, above-ground ICBM tests are much more noticeable and subject to
    detection.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127; Only Russia, China, France and Great Britain have long range ballistic
    missiles capable of hitting the United States, and the French and British missiles are on
    submarines.&nbsp; North Korea's No Dong missile, for example, has a range of only about
    800 kilometers.&nbsp; None of the countries that are potentially hostile to the United
    States that may be seeking to develop long-range missiles has even flight tested a missile
    that could hit the United States.&nbsp; Flight tests -- tests that can be easily detected
    -- will be necessary before deployment.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127; National missile defense (NMD) provides no defense against the most likely
    future attacks on U.S., which would not be delivered by missiles. The methods of delivery
    have already been demonstrated at the World Trade Center in New York, the Federal Building
    in Oklahoma City and the subway in Tokyo.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127; Deployment of a national missile defense could reduce U.S. security by
    jeopardizing further cuts in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &amp;127; It would be more cost effective to spend money on programs to reduce the most
    urgent proliferation threats, such as on the dismantlement of Russian warheads, making
    weapons-usable fissile material in the former Soviet republics more secure, strengthening
    the IAEA, and improving verification techniques. <br>

    ====================================================================<br>
    <br>
    General Accounting Office Report, June 23, 1998, &quot;National Missile Defense -- Even
    With Increase Funding Technical and Schedule Risks are High&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Overall technical risk associated with a fiscal year 2003 deployment remains high
    because the amount of testing, although increased, is still limited compared to other
    programs.&nbsp; Even after the increase in the number of tests, the program manager told
    us that in his view, the planned flight test program is anemic.&nbsp; The program plans a
    maximum of 16-system level flight tests through the end of fiscal year 2003, the earliest
    planned deployment date.&nbsp; By contrast, the Safeguard program included 111 flight
    tests before the system became operational.&nbsp; Of these 111 tests, 70 were intercept
    tests, 58 of which were successful . . . Despite the additional activities, the risk of
    the program being completed on its current schedule is still high.&nbsp; Also, any
    decision in fiscal year 2000 to deploy an NMD system by 2003 would involve high technical
    risk because the associated compressed schedule will permit only limited testing of the
    system.&quot; <p align="center"># # #</td>
