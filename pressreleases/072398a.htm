    announced that as part of the plea agreement between Odwalla Inc. and the U.S. Attorney's
    Office, S.T.O.P. will receive $125,000 over 5 years. In the agreement, Odwalla pled guilty
    to &quot;16 counts of criminal misdemeanor for unknowingly shipping adulterated
    juice.&quot; In the fall of 1996, Odwalla brand unpasteurized apple juice products
    contaminated by the deadly bacteria E.coli O157:H7 sickened at least 70 people. Victims
    were identified in California, Washington, Colorado, and British Columbia. Fourteen
    children developed the life-threatening condition Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which
    is the leading cause of kidney failure in children. One of them, sixteen-month-old Anna
    Gimmestad of Colorado, died from HUS related multiple organ failure. E. coli O157:H7
    survivors face a lifetime of medical uncertainty, and may battle significant health
    complications for years following the initial illness.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We strongly support the government's pursuit of companies that ship contaminated
    foods that cause life threatening illness,&quot; said Nancy Donley, President of S.T.O.P.
    &quot;Such companies should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&quot; S.T.O.P.
    has supported the imposition of criminal and civil penalties for offenders. &quot;This
    should place industry on notice that hazardous and illegal activities will be
    prosecuted.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In resolving this case, the federal government has set two significant examples. First,
    the government quickly pursued a company suspected of violating food safety standards.
    Second, a portion of the settlement will be distributed to a victim's organization,
    whereas typically all the monetary penalties are paid exclusively to the government.
    Pursuant to negotiations, Odwalla Inc. and the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to direct a
    portion of the fines imposed on Odwalla to S.T.O.P.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We applaud the creative decision to allocate money to S.T.O.P. as part of the
    resolution of the legal action,&quot; said S.T.O.P.'s Executive Director Elaine Dodge.
    &quot;The contribution to S.T.O.P. will ensure that money will be used directly to benefit
    victims and educate consumers.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    S.T.O.P. members affected by contaminated juice are developing consumer education and
    victim's assistance programs that would be funded by thesettlement. Under consideration
    are:<br>
    <br>
    Expansion of the foodborne illness victim's section of the S.T.O.P. website
    (www.stop-usa.org/victims.html); <br>
    <br>
    Establishment of a Foodborne Illness Outbreak Report for all 50 states;<br>
    <br>
    and,&nbsp; Sponsorship of a Foodborne Illness Victims Conference addressing medical
    issues. <br>
    <br>
    S.T.O.P. -- Safe Tables Our Priority is an independent, national, non-profit, grassroots
    organization devoted to victim assistance, public education, and policy advocacy for safe
    food and public health. The organization was founded in 1993 by families and friends of
    people who became ill or died from exposure to E. coli O157:H7 in meat. Our membership has
    grown to include victims of pathogenic bacteria from a variety of foods, and their family
    members, consumers, and concerned members of the public health and public interest
    communities.<p align="center">###</td>
