    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 23 -The United States can meet its obligations under
    the Kyoto climate treaty at overall economic savings or a very modest cost, according to a
    new report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists. While this conclusion is
    expected to echo a soon-to-released Clinton Administration analysis, A Small Price to Pay
    shows that the US need not rely on emission cuts in other countries to meet the Kyoto
    reduction requirements.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Contrary to the doomsday economic predictions of the fossil fuel industry and its
    supporters, we can stem global warming without slowing the economy,&quot; said Alden
    Meyer, Director of Government Relations for the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;The
    US can meet the Kyoto target and save consumers money through common sense energy use at
    home.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Kyoto Protocol requires the United States to cut its emissions of heat-trapping gases
    7 percent below 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012. The new report applies this target
    and the most recent data on emissions to previous independent government, scientific, and
    private economic studies to determine the cost of action. These studies demonstrate that
    the US could reduce emissions by as much as 13 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 with net
    savings.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tales of economic Armageddon from climate foes have been consistently panned by
    independent analyses,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;The impacts of global warming could be quite
    costly. This study is further proof that preventive action need not be.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The fossil fuel lobby and their supporters in Congress have been quick to label the Kyoto
    Protocol prohibitively expensive. Such alarmist predictions presume that the nation would
    cut emissions in costly ways and ignore the many cost-effective policies available to
    stimulate greater use of energy efficiency and renewable technologies. Critics of action
    also ignore the potentially large economic costs of global warming, including many impacts
    that are not easily quantified in dollars.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;With insurance against global warming so affordable, it&#146;s time for Congress to
    act rather than demagogue and delay,&quot; said Meyer. <p align="center">###</td>
