Breakup of RJR Nabisco is Significant Victory For INFACT's Tobacco Industry

        - March 9 - </font>The sale of RJR Nabisco's international tobacco unit, followed by the split of 
its US tobacco business from its Nabisco food division, marks a significant 
victory for INFACT's Tobacco Industry Campaign, targeting RJR Nabisco along with 
Philip Morris since 1993. &quot;The decision to split RJR Nabisco's food and 
tobacco businesses shows that through grassroots organizing and public pressure, 
people can win life-saving changes from giant corporations,&quot; says INFACT 
Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey. The corporation is seeking to free Nabisco, 
which along with Philip Morris's Kraft has been a target of INFACT's Tobacco 
Industry Boycott, from the liability of tobacco.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;With the completion of these transactions, RJR Nabisco--the corporation 
responsible for Joe Camel and other outrageous youth-oriented tobacco promotion 
schemes--will no longer exist in the same size and scope,&quot; says Mulvey. 
&quot;Tobacco giants like Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco have long gotten away 
with marketing abuses because of their stranglehold over public policy.&quot; 
With the disintegration of RJR Nabisco, its influence as a corporation--along 
with that of the entire tobacco industry--over US and international policy will 
be dramatically reduced. The removal of the veil of legitimacy provided by 
Nabisco will further shrink and isolate the tobacco business, and its capacity 
to spread tobacco addiction around the world.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">RJR Nabisco's statement that the separation will allow all divisions to meet 
their potential is an admission that the food business has been dragged down by 
the liabilities of tobacco. The corporation has faced intense pressure from 
investors favoring a Nabisco spin-off, some specifically referencing INFACT's 
Boycott as a reason to sever Nabisco's association with tobacco. &quot;Just as 
public pressure forced RJR Nabisco to withdraw Joe Camel, organized consumer 
pressure on its food business and exposure of global abuses have helped create a 
climate forcing RJR Nabisco to sell off and quarantine its tobacco 
business,&quot; says Mulvey.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Prior to the launch of INFACT's Boycott in 1994, Nabisco had been gaining 
ground from competitors. Since 1994, that trend has been reversed. Nabisco has 
disappointed analysts' projections of double-digit growth, and earnings have 
fallen short of expectations, according to the corporation's own Annual Reports 
and statements by top corporate executives. INFACT's Boycott has been a key 
factor in tarnishing Nabisco's image by linking food brands with the tobacco 
parent. Internal documents released as a result of the Minnesota lawsuit further 
demonstrate RJR Nabisco's concern about INFACT's Boycott.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">RJR Nabisco's decision to exit the international tobacco market comes less 
than a year after the release of INFACT's <EM><STRONG>Global Aggression: 
</STRONG>The Case for World Standards and Bold US Action Challenging Philip 
Morris and RJR Nabisco.</EM> Through its ongoing Tobacco Industry Campaign, 
INFACT will monitor the impact of RJR Nabisco's breakup on tobacco marketing and 
influence-peddling around the world - including Japan Tobacco's promotion of new 
brands it is acquiring. INFACT will also closely monitor the spin-off to ensure 
that Nabisco will indeed be independent from RJR's tobacco interests. If the 
spin-off is completed, it would allow INFACT to focus full attention on Philip
Morris - the driving force behind the tobacco industry in the US and 
internationally.</font>
