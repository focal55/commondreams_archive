        - March 12 - </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Landscape: </font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">According to government research, there are 65 million cable subscribers in 
the country. The cable industry is adding about 2 million subscribers a year. 
Currently, almost 70 percent of households subscribe to cable.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">More than 90 percent of cable subscribers receive expanded service, which 
usually includes the most popular cable channels such as ESPN, CNN, TBS and 
TNT.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which called for the 
end of cable regulation, cable rates have climbed 22 percent and continue to 
climb about three or four times the rate of inflation. <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Federal Communications Commission data show that, in 150 communities where 
there has been competition, cable rates are about 10 percent lower than in areas 
where a cable provider has a monopoly on service. If rates were reduced to this 
competition level nationwide, consumers would save about $3 billion a year.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Direct Broadcast Satellite service caters to the high-end of the television 
viewing market, failing to bring true competition to the cable industry. <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to the up-front costs for a satellite dish and related installation 
charges, which run three-to-five times the cost of installing cable, satellite 
TV remains too costly for many consumers.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumers Union has found that satellite service today is little threat to 
cable because, in part, nearly one-half of satellite TV subscribers purchase 
cable as well.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The Telecommunications Act of 1996 set an arbitrary three-year period on 
cable regulation, assuming that the industry would face increased competition 
from satellite broadcasters and telephone companies in that time. March 31 is 
the last day of that three-year period.<BR></font></LI></UL>
        <B><font size="2" face="Arial">Statement of 
Gene Kimmelman,</font></B> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Co-director of the </B><A 
href="http://www.consunion.org/aboutcu/contact.htm#DC"><B>Washington DC 
office</B></A><B> of Consumers 
Union,<BR>publisher of Consumer Reports magazine:<BR></B></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;When Republicans took over Congress in 1994, they made deregulation a 
priority and wanted no controls at all on the cable industry. It took two years 
to come up with legislation that would satisfy the Congress and secure 
Presidential approval. Despite preserving public oversight for three years, 
Congress made it clear that it wanted the Federal Communications Commission to 
get out of the business of regulation. And the FCC acquiesced with a 'hands-off' 
policy that has allowed cable rates to jump 22 percent in the last three 
years.<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law that was supposed to provide 
consumers with competition to prevent skyrocketing cable rates, has failed to 
keep the hands of the cable operators out of consumers' wallets. Cable rates 
have risen almost four times the rate of inflation in the last three years. The 
rates just keep climbing because most of the 65 million Americans who subscribe 
to cable have no choice about where to get their service.<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Congress must take immediate, forceful action to correct its mistake 
and give consumers relief from spiraling cable rates. Consumers Union believes 
that policymakers must put a new lid on cable rates, and open the cable market 
to more competition from satellite television and other providers. Only when 
satellite television or other providers offer the vast majority of cable 
subscribers an alternative that meets their needs, will cable companies be 
forced to bring down prices.<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We believe it is critical to both enable and require satellite and 
other companies to become head-to-head competitors with cable for the core 
television services that consumers want most. This means:<BR></font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Elimination of rules that prevent satellite companies and other cable 
competitors from carrying local programs, such as local news.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Passage of legislation which gives satellite and other potential cable 
competitors comparable treatment under our nation's communications and copyright 
laws;<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Expansion of previous laws designed to hold down cable rates and make 
popular television channels available to cable's potential competitor's;<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Aggressive regulatory oversight of potential access to cable equipment and 
cable-owned programming;<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Strong antitrust and regulatory review of satellite mergers to ensure that 
satellite companies continue to reduce up-front costs and eliminate other 
obstacles to direct price competition with the cable industry.<BR></font></LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Unfortunately, April 1 will find most consumers playing the fool and 
paying inflated cable rates. Due to Congress' lack of action on this issue, the 
only choice consumers will have is to pay the ever-increasing cable bill or 
cancel their cable service.&quot;</font></P>
