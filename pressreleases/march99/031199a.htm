        - March 11 - </font>

        <font face="Arial" size="2">Awash in legal and public relations woes, TV preacher Pat Robertson and his 
Christian Coalition will attempt to turn the tide against them by announcing 
today a &quot;get out the vote&quot; strategy for religious conservatives in 
advance of the 2000 elections.</font>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Robertson is desperately trying to regain some momentum 
after a year of disasters, blunders and defeats,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. 
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
&quot;Unless he can control his radical rhetoric and get his political machine 
running smoothly again, Robertson risks losing his ringside seat in the 
Republicans' 'big tent.'</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Robertson is a rogue elephant in the GOP china shop,&quot; 
added Lynn, a leading critic of the Religious Right. &quot;Whatever happens, 
he's likely to break a lot of dishes.&quot;</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2">As evidence of the Religious Right group's troubles, Lynn noted 
that the Christian Coalition has been beset by one crisis after another in the 
last year. Over the last twelve months:</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Christian Coalition President Don Hodel resigned,</B> 
apparently due to a complete inability to function under Robertson's reign. 
<I>The Washington Times</I> quoted one source as saying that Hodel grew 
frustrated by the fact that the Christian Coalition &quot;was not consistently 
putting principle over politics.&quot;</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Former Coalition Executive Director Ralph Reed has resigned 
from the Coalition Board. </B>In addition, CC National Operations Director Chuck 
Cunningham has quit, taking two other key staffers with him.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> The Internal Revenue Service continued to give Robertson 
fits.</B> The Christian Coalition is under investigation by the IRS, which has 
refused to grant the organization's request for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. 
Also, Robertson was forced to pay a penalty to the IRS for illegal campaigning 
done by his Christian Broadcasting Network, including a retroactive tax-exempt 
revocation for CBN for 1986 and 1987.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> The Federal Election Commission's lawsuit against the 
Coalition for illegal partisan electioneering progressed.</B> Documents released 
as a result of the trial have been embarrassing for the Coalition as they detail 
close ties between the Christian Coalition and the campaign operatives of 
incumbent candidate George Bush in the 1992 presidential election.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"> <B>The Virginia Attorney General's office has also continued its 
investigation of Robertson for alleged unethical business practices</B> stemming 
from accusations of misuse of Operation Blessing charity airplanes to benefit 
Robertson's for-profit diamond mining operation in the Congo.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Oklahoma State Senator Dave Herbert (D) has filed a 
defamation lawsuit against the Oklahoma Christian Coalition. </B>This suit, 
filed in District Court of Oklahoma County, charges that the Coalition voter 
guide falsely reported that Herbert supports &quot;abortion on demand,&quot; 
&quot;minors' access to pornography in libraries,&quot; &quot;increased federal 
control of education&quot; and &quot;socialized health care&quot; and wants to 
&quot;decriminalize sodomy and beastiality [sic].&quot;</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Robertson made Religious Right activists and Republican 
allies in Congress angry</B> by abruptly calling for an end to the impeachment 
trial, after months of demanding Clinton's removal. In September, Robertson said 
getting Clinton out of office was a top goal of the Coalition, dismissing 
resignation as too easy and demanding that he be impeached. Then, in February, 
he reversed course and concluded that Clinton had won.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> The Christian Coalition has continued to lose visibility and 
movement leadership </B>to other Religious Right figures including presidential 
candidate Gary Bauer and his Family Research Council, as well as James Dobson of 
Focus on the Family.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Robertson has no clear candidate for the 2000 presidential 
election.</B> While Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft was Robertson's early favorite, 
his departure from the race leaves no apparent choice. Some candidates who are 
courting the Religious Right appear unpalatable to Robertson, including Bauer, 
who is associated with a rival organization.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> The Coalition suffered multiple failures in the 1998 
elections, </B>despite spending millions of dollars. Some of the group's 
favorite and most sympathetic candidates went down in defeat, including 
high-profile incumbents such as Govs. Fob James in Alabama and David Beasley in 
South Carolina.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Churches began to turn away from the group.</B> After an 
election year campaign by Americans United to educate churches on the dangers of 
getting caught up in the Coalition's political machine, many church leaders 
rejected the group's materials out of fears that the &quot;voter guides&quot; 
are too partisan and may jeopardize the church's tax exemption. Accordingly, the 
Christian Coalition's chosen method of distribution for their campaign materials 
was severely hampered. University of Akron Prof. John C. Green and other 
political science scholars said that the Religious Right's electoral misfortunes 
were due in part to &quot;more determined opposition&quot; from groups such as 
Americans United (<I>The Christian Century</I>, Dec. 23, 1998).</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><B> Robertson himself was made the subject of national public 
ridicule.</B> In June, Americans United alerted the media to Robertson's 
announcement that Orlando may be struck by a hurricane and &quot;possibly a 
meteor&quot; after flying rainbow colored flags from city lightposts during the 
annual &quot;Gay Days&quot; festivities. That was followed by AU's discovery in 
July that Robertson's Regent University received funds from the National 
Endowment for the Arts while Robertson was calling on Congress to shut down the 
agency.</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2">Americans United is a church-state watchdog group based in 
Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and 
allied houses of worship in all 50 states.</font></P>
