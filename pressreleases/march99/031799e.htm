        - March 17 - </font>Emmy Award-winning writer and best-selling author Al Franken will serve as 
master of ceremonies for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids' 1999 Youth 
Advocates of the Year Awards gala on April 29.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Franken will team up with event chairman, actor/director Rob
Reiner, to 
recognize outstanding young tobacco prevention activists who have 
distinguished themselves as leaders among thousands of kids working to 
protect their peers, their communities and the nation from tobacco 
addiction.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Youth Advocates of the Year Awards program, now in its third
year, 
was created to encourage tobacco prevention activism and leadership among 
the nation's youth who are fighting for healthier futures. The Campaign will 
honor one national winner, five regional winners and one group winner. Award 
recipients will serve as spokespersons for the Campaign, work in their 
communities against tobacco and encourage kids and adults across the country 
to join the fight against youth tobacco use. Franken, one of the founding members of Saturday Night Live, is possibly best known for portraying
the &quot;I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me&quot; character, Stuart Smalley.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">One of Franken's more recent accomplishments is his creation of
the NBC 
sitcom &quot;Lateline.&quot; He also has been recognized as a best-selling 
author with the book, &quot;Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot&quot;; a hit 
screenwriter with the movie, &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;; and a political satirist as a commentator for CNN and for his appearances
on 
such shows as &quot;Politically Incorrect.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Al Franken is an outstanding performer and is a great addition to
this year's event,&quot; said Bill Novelli, Campaign president. &quot;We're excited to have him and chairman Rob Reiner to help us turn the
Washington spotlight on the young stars of the evening.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Reiner, perhaps best known for his memorable son-in-law role on
the CBS 
sitcom &quot;All in the Family,&quot; has devoted substantial time and resources to tobacco control and other issues affecting children.
Last 
fall, he spearheaded a successful campaign for passage of California's 
Proposition 10 initiative, designed to fund early childhood development and 
anti-tobacco programs through an increase in the state's tobacco tax.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;More than 3,000 children become regular smokers every day,&quot; said
Reiner. &quot;It is crucial that we break tobacco's grip on our kids and slow down this alarming rate of addiction.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The 1999 awards will be presented in Washington, D.C., on April 29
at the 
National Building Museum at 6:30 p.m. More than 500 attendees are expected, 
including members of Congress and the Administration; public health, 
business and community leaders; and, of course, kids.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Award recipients will be chosen based on how their initiative,
leadership, creative thinking, problem solving and communication skills 
have altered state and local policies and beliefs that limit kids' access to 
tobacco. Each of the winners will receive grants to continue his/her local 
efforts to educate kids about the dangers of tobacco.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We want to support and recognize the exceptional work
that these kids have done, and will continue to do, in the hope that all of us can 
look forward to a healthier, tobacco-free future,&quot; said Franken. &quot;Or something like that.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is the largest non-government
initiative ever undertaken to decrease youth tobacco use in the United 
States. Its mandate is to focus the nation's attention and action on keeping 
tobacco marketing from seducing children, and making tobacco less accessible 
to kids.</font>

Awards gala,
