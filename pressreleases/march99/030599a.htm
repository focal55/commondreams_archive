<FONT SIZE=2><P><font face="Arial">MEDIA ADVISORY</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">Press Conference: 10 am - 11:30 am  Monday,  March 8, 1999</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Sheraton Seattle, 1400 Sixth Avenue, East Room B</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">BIG OIL - BIG LIES: THE EXXON DISASTER CONTINUES</font></P>

        </FONT>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> Actor Ted Danson, who became famous in his role as Cheers television
bartender Sam Malone, will join the Alaska Truth Squad as the All-Alaska panel of scientists, Native leaders and oil industry analysts give a
message to the world outlining the continuing impacts of the Exxon Valdez disaster.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ten years after the nation's worst environmental catastrophe (March 24,
1999), the Alaska Truth Squad has scheduled a press conference in Seattle immediately prior to the opening of the industry/government-sponsored
International Oil Spill Conference (IOSC). The Alaska speakers will set the record straight regarding the Exxon Valdez oil spill and its continuing
impacts.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">When the Alaska Truth Squad learned that Danson, an outspoken supporter of
conservation issues, had planned to speak at the International Oil Spill Conference, the group immediately appealed for his participation in the
Truth Squad event.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"We're very encouraged by Mr. Danson's support," said Rick Steiner, an
Alaska marine advisor who will moderate the Alaska Truth Squad press event.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"His solidarity with the people, animals and communities still suffering
from the Exxon Valdez disaster  means a lot. We hope people around the world can learn from Ted Danson's example."
Danson, president of the American Oceans Campaign, will deliver a call to action urging the prevention of future oil spills.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">At the Oil Spill industry conference, Exxon and other oil company giants
are expected to attempt once again to portray oil spills in general - and the Exxon Valdez in particular - as relatively benign, easily dealt with,
and mere financial and political nuisances; the Alaskan message documents these clear and simple truths:</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">* the Exxon Valdez spill continues to be the most damaging oil
spill in history</font></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">* the injured ecosystem and human communities have not recovered</font></P>
        </FONT>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">* Exxon refuses to pay the $5.2  billion punitive damage verdict to
30,000 Alaska Natives, fishing families, businesses, and others injured by Exxon's recklessness</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">* despite modest improvements in spill prevention and response, our
nation's coastal waters are presently at significant risk of catastrophic spills like the Exxon Valdez</font></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">* the Exxon-Mobil merger should not be approved</font></P>
        </FONT>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">* restoration after the Exxon Valdez has accomplished some habitat
protection, but it was too little, too late</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*  the oil industry has failed to take responsibility to ensure the
safety of the aging Alaska tanker fleet (mandate double-hull tankers) and Trans-Alaska pipeline.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Alaskan speakers will call for multinational government action to deny
the largest-ever corporate merger between Exxon and Mobil.  The message is: "Bring Exxon to Justice,"-  pay overdue punitive awards to spill-impacted
Alaskans.</font></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>

<P><font face="Arial">Alaska Truth Squad Presenters:</font></P>

        </FONT>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Riki Ott - Cordova resident, biologist, former fisherwoman and author
- will discuss the ecological damage and lack of recovery, social and economic disruption, and Exxon's problem with the truth.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dune Lankard - commercial fisherman, Eyak Preservation Council, Native
spokesperson for Eyak people, lifelong resident of Prince William Sound - will discuss Native subsistence impacts, and what life was like in the
region before Big Oil.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">David Grimes - Alaska wilderness guide, musician, former fisher in Prince
William Sound - will discuss the historic Restoration program - the coastal habitat to be protected by Exxon's $1 billion tax-deductible criminal
settlement, and the many tragic failures of the government process.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Walt Parker - former chair of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission, present
member of the Arctic Research Commission, a director of Oil Watch Alaska - will present a Report Card on how poorly government and industry have
implemented the recommendations made 10 years ago by the Alaska Oil Spill Commission</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Stan Stephens - Valdez charter boat operator for several decades, past
president of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council which oversees the oil industry and government - will talk about weak
links in both the national and Prince William Sound spill prevention policies</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Moderator - Rick Steiner  - founding member of the Coastal Coalition in
Cordova and a marine advisor for Prince William Sound since 1983, played critical roles immediately following the spill and ever since.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Presentations will take place between 10 am and 10:30 am, with the balance
of time devoted to press questions.  From 11:30 to Noon, the slide show "Half Empty - Half Full," covering natural resources damages from the
Exxon Valdez spill will be shown followed by statements by Dan Ritzman of Greenpeace on Arctic oil issues.</font></P>
