        - March 17 - </font>The nation could avoid 1.2 million tons of smog-forming pollution every
        year if we ended the current pollution loophole for SUVs and other light
        trucks, according to "Big Cars, Dirty Air," a report released today by U.S.
        PIRG. Currently, light trucks, such as SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks,
        are allowed to emit up to three times as much nitrogen oxide as passenger
        cars.  This year, the EPA is expected to propose new rules for automobile
        air pollution that could require automakers to make SUVs and other light
        trucks as clean as passenger cars.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"While Detroit makes a fortune selling ever-larger and dirtier
SUVs, the public breathes the unhealthy consequences," said Angie Farleigh, Clean Air
Advocate with U.S. PIRG. "It뭩 time for automakers to clean up SUVs so that they play by the same clean air rules as cars," continued Farleigh.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report also documents the state-by-state benefits of the rule, assuming
benefits are distributed in proportion to the number of SUVs and other light trucks on the road in each state.  The report found that:</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> If the SUV loophole is not closed, the SUVs and other light trucks
projected to be on the road would emit 1.38 million tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide each year by the year 2020.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> If the SUV loophole is closed nationwide, by 2020, the projected number
of SUVs and other light trucks would only emit 196,600 tons of NOx--one-seventh the amount they would emit if the loophole is not closed.
Closing the  SUV loophole will cut 1.2 million tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide each year.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> California, which has already adopted standards similar to the EPA
proposal, has the most to gain by closing the SUV loophole.  Assuming the benefits of closing the loophole are distributed in proportion to the
number of SUVs and other light trucks per state, the states, other than California, with the most to gain from closing the loophole would be Texas,
Florida, Michigan, Ohio, New York, Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, Washington, and Pennsylvania.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> From 1992 to 1997, the number of SUVs and other light trucks on the road
grew from 54 million to 68 million.  Today there is one light truck for every 3.9 Americans. If current growth continues, there will be an
estimated 133 million light trucks on the road by the year 2020. Given population growth projections, this would be one light truck for every 2.4
people.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Automobiles, especially light trucks, are a major source of the pollutants
that create smog.  They emit 30% of the nation's nitrogen oxides (NOx) pollution. The American Lung Association estimates that there are more than
117 million Americans who live in areas where the air is unhealthy to breathe due to high levels of smog pollution.  Smog sends tens of thousands
of Americans to hospital emergency rooms each year.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"People drive SUVs like cars, but they pollute like trucks," said Farleigh.
"By adopting tough new standards, the EPA can help us all breathe a little
easier.&quot;</font></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>

<P><font face="Arial">"Big Cars, Dirty Air" projects the benefits of closing the SUV loophole
nationwide, in the year 2020 when most vehicles on the road would meet the new standards.  The term &quot;SUV loophole&quot; includes SUVs as well as minivans
and some pickup trucks.  The EPA is considering this action as part of proposed &quot;Tier 2&quot; regulations. Under the Clean Air Act, Congress mandated
that the EPA finalize these new emission standards, to become effective in2004, by the end of this year.  This February, EPA submitted a draft Tier 2rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review in advance of making
the draft rule public.  The public comment period is expected to begin as early as this April. California adopted similar standards last November.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial">The SUV loophole dates back to a time when SUVs and other light trucks were
used primarily as work vehicles for off-road or hauling purposes.  Over the past two decades, SUVs and other light trucks have become the fastest
selling and most profitable passenger vehicle in the U.S., used for virtually the same purposes as cars.  Sales of SUVs alone have grown
tenfold since 1980, with 2.8 million new SUVs sold in the U.S. last year.</font></P>
        </FONT>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to reducing SUV and other light truck pollution to the same
level as passenger cars, the EPA is also considering several ways to reduce auto pollution.  U.S. PIRG and a growing coalition of health and
environmental groups are urging the EPA to:</font></P>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial"> Adopt tougher standards that would ensure that new cars and light trucks
            are clean. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Require diesel engines to meet the same tough new standards as
            gasoline engines. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Cut sulfur content in gasoline to the levels currently
            available in California.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Increase the production and availability of
            advanced technology vehicles.</font></li>
        </ul>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"This decision will affect how clean our air will be for decades to come,"
said Farleigh.  "We're calling on EPA to put the brakes on auto pollution."</font></P>
