HRC Says McCaffrey's Position On Medical Marijuana Study Directly Contradicts
        His Position On Needle Exchange Programs</font></b></td>

        - March 18 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The Human Rights Campaign strongly criticized Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of 
the Office of National Drug Control Policy today for touting &quot;science&quot; 
in his reaction to a medical marijuana study, but refusing to consider 
&quot;science&quot; in his position on needle exchange programs last Spring.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We are pleased that Gen. McCaffrey has found science,&quot; said Winnie
Stachelberg, HRC's political director. &quot;We hope his new found confidence in 
science will lead him to reconsider his opposition to needle exchange programs, 
which science concludes saves lives.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A statement released yesterday by the ONDCP in response to a study by the 
Institute of Medicine on the use of medical marijuana, says &quot;We are 
delighted that science is the basis of the discussion of this issue.&quot; The 
statement concluded by saying &quot;We will continue to rely on the professional
judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the 
National Institute of Health, and the Surgeon General on all issues related to 
the medical value of marijuana....&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Yet Gen. McCaffrey refused to listen to the same government officials who all 
concluded that needle exchange programs are effective in the battle against HIV 
and AIDS.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;After reviewing all of the research, we have unanimously agreed that 
there is conclusive scientific evidence that needle exchange programs, as part 
of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy, are an effective public health 
intervention that reduces the transmission of HIV and does not encourage the use 
of illegal drugs,&quot; said the heads of the National Institute of Health, 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, and the Surgeon General among others. The statement was 
made in an April 20, 1998, memorandum to Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala urging her to certify the effectiveness of needle exchange 
programs which she did the same day.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">By certifying the scientific evidence in support of needle exchange, the 
Secretary could have allowed local communities to use federal funds to support 
these life saving programs. However, due in large part to Gen. McCaffrey's 
opposition, the Clinton Administration decided to maintain the federal funding 
ban despite the Secretary's action. According to a <I>Washington Times</I> 
report a week after the Secretary's certification of the science, it was 
McCaffrey who convinced President Clinton that the opinions of the country's 
preeminent scientists and public health officials were wrong and that the 
science on needle exchange was still uncertain. &quot;[The President] and I are 
happy [with] the way this came out,&quot; he is quoted as saying.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite the continued prohibition on the use of federal funds, the debate 
continues. Congress last year prohibited the District of Columbia from using 
their own local funds for needle exchange and cut off all federal funds to 
individual organizations which use private funds to do so. Similar bills have 
already been introduced to apply similar prohibitions across the country.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our hope is that Gen. McCaffrey will apply his new found confidence in 
science to this debate&quot; says Stachelberg. &quot;His words can actually save 
lives if he chooses to oppose further congressional involvement in this 
issue.&quot;</font></P>
