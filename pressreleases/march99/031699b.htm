        - March 16 - </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We are here today with the <A 
href="http://www.now.org/issues/legislat/02-09-99.html#education">Women's Equality 
Summit</A>, as a combined force of over 50 national women's organizations, 
knocking again on the door of <A 
href="http://thomas.loc.gov/bss/d106query.html">Congress</A>.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For almost five years now, Congressional leaders have ignored women's 
voices.  They have let good bills die in committee . . . bills that would 
increase women's income through pay equity . . . bills that would assure child 
care for those who need it . . . bills that would make our homes and streets 
safer for women. These are the issues that the vast majority of women -- 
Republican and Democrat, older and younger -- all want to see passed.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Why hasn't Congress acted?  Aren't they listening to women?</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Not only have they ignored women's demand for child care, domestic violence 
programs, pay equity and health care.  They have passed bills that actually 
restrict women's equality and opportunity.  The last two Congresses passed 88 
bills that limit women's access to reproductive health services.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Now the Republican leadership wants to pass a meaningless bill they call the 
Patients' Bill of Rights Plus (S.300) -- B.S. Plus for short.  <A 
href="http://www.senate.gov/contacting/index.cfm">Senate</A> leaders want to 
fool the public into thinking that health care consumers will now have 
assurances to vital health services from their Health Maintenance 
Organizations.  But women won't be fooled.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Women want real protections in our health care plans.  We want comprehensive 
legislation which guarantees and enforces patients' access to services.  There 
is a true Patients' Bill of Rights, introduced as S.6.  It would ensure that 
treatment decisions are in the hands of doctors -- not insurance companies.   It 
would require insurance companies to pay for emergency services, and would 
prevent health care professionals from being financially rewarded for limiting a 
patient's care.  S. 6 allows patients to appeal denials of care and gives women 
direct access to OB/GYN services without going through a primary care doctor.  
None of these key provisions are in the Republican bill that will come to the 
Senate floor next week and we intend to defeat it.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For several years now, women's groups have called for expansion of programs 
and protections under the <A 
href="http://www.usdoj.gov/vawo/vawa/vawa.htm">Violence Against Women Act</A>.  
The Senate last year let a bill die that would have continued very effective 
programs under that act and authorized other new ones.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Opponents of women's rights argue that the only government intervention 
necessary to curb violence is more jails. They even go so far as to question 
whether there really is a problem. Feminists know that you just have to talk to 
women to know that violence against women has reached epidemic proportions.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This year, most of those effective programs which have saved so many lives 
will expire, and more women's lives will be in danger.  Even if the Senate acts 
to re-authorize programs, they may well slash funding.  The National Domestic 
Violence Hotline gets 10,000 calls for help each month and battered women's 
shelters must turn away desperate women and their children every day.  Yet 
Congress is turning its back. Shame!</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Women demand that Congress pass new legislation to bring effective 
anti-violence programs to every community, urban and rural, serving women of 
color, older women, lesbians, and other groups that have been under-served.  We 
must fully support shelters so that no woman is turned away when she tries to 
escape an abusive relationship. The new Violence Against Women Act will 
authorize a billion dollars for more space and services at battered women's 
shelters.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps most importantly, the <A 
href="http://www.now.org/issues/violence/vawa/vawa1998.html">Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA) of 1998</A> proposes a host of workplace initiatives that reflect the 
reality of women in danger where they are employed. Many of the proposals are 
designed to encourage employers to take steps to reduce that danger through 
heightened security measures and flexible job policies. <BR>  <BR>Women are 
telling Congressional leaders that they must also pass this year the <A 
href="http://www.now.org/nnt/01-98/campaig.html">Hate Crimes Prevention Act</A>.  This bill 
sets the pace and tone of our national effort to combat hate violence based on 
gender, sexual orientation or disability.  Women demand that we be able live our 
lives without the fear of being assaulted, beaten or murdered.  The resources of 
the federal government must be brought to bear against these hate crimes, 
including serial rape, serial battering, mutilation and hate-motivated murder.  
They must be investigated and their perpetrators prosecuted.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Hate crimes happen every day all across the nation. Often local law 
enforcement authorities do not have the necessary tools -- and sometimes lack 
the will -- to vigorously pursue them.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For 12 long years, the National Organization for Women and scores of other 
national groups have advocated for expanding the Hate Crimes statutes.  Congress 
seems to be hard of hearing, but we will keep repeating it . . . and you can 
even read our lips:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We demand that a national policy to end hate crimes against women be adopted 
now. <BR>Congress, did you hear us?</font>
