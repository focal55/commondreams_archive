      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - March 16 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">A new study by the national conservation group American Forests documents a 
dramatic loss of tree cover in the southeast portion of the Chesapeake Bay 
watershed, including the greater Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. The 
analysis calculates previously unreported costs of tree loss due to urban sprawl 
and benefits of tree cover as it relates to air and water quality and stormwater 
runoff in this increasingly urbanized region.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This is just the latest evidence of why we need to change our 
development patterns before it is too late,&quot; said Maryland Governor Parris 
N. Glendening, whose 1997 Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation initiative 
has received national acclaim. &quot;The American Forests study, coupled with 
the steady loss of agricultural and other resource lands in the Chesapeake Bay 
region, ought to sound the alarm for every American.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The analysis of three satellite images from 1973, 1985 and 1997 found that 
areas with high vegetation and tree canopy coverage dropped from 55 percent (6.3 
million acres) to 38 percent (4.4 million acres) of the total area (11.4 million 
acres). During the same 24-year period, areas with very low tree cover increased 
from 35 to more than 50 percent of the total study area. High canopy coverage 
was defined as 50 percent tree cover or more. Very low canopy coverage was 
defined as less than 20 percent tree cover. The average tree cover throughout 
the study area declined from 51 percent to 39 percent.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The dominant ecological feature here just 30 years ago was heavy 
forests. Today it is development and lands sparsely covered with trees. These 
changes are so large they threaten to undermine many important natural functions 
performed by forest ecosystems,&quot; said Gary Moll, vice president, American 
Forests Urban Forest Center.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Analysis of a 1.5-million-acre area surrounding the Baltimore-Washington 
corridor shows similar trends. Average tree cover declined just slightly more 
than the larger region, from 51 to 37 percent. Areas with heavy tree cover 
declined from 55 to 37 percent, and areas with little or no tree cover increased 
from 31 to 49 percent.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The loss of tree cover and increase in impervious surfaces, such as roads and 
buildings, increased the cost of stormwater management in the 
Baltimore-Washington area. The study found that stormwater flow during a peak 
storm event increased by an estimated 540 million cubic feet or 19 percent. 
Replacing this lost stormwater retention capacity with reservoirs and other 
engineered systems would cost $1.08 billion ($2 per cubic foot). This service 
was provided previously by trees, vegetation and natural soils, which slow 
stormwater movement, lower total runoff volume, reduce costly flooding, and 
improve the Chesapeake Bay region's overall water quality.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Air quality control costs also grew. The lost tree canopy would have removed 
about 9.3 million pounds of pollutants from the atmosphere annually at a value 
of approximately $24 million. Baltimore-Washington’s urban forest improves air 
quality by removing nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>), sulfur dioxide 
(SO<SUB>2</SUB>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>), and particulate 
matter 10 microns (PM<SUB>10</SUB>) or less.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The American Forests study highlights the urgency which must be placed 
on maintaining tree cover and forests throughout Maryland and the entire 
Chesapeake Bay watershed,&quot; Senator Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) said. &quot;By 
taking these steps now to replenish a healthy tree cover, we will not only help 
to restore the Bay's natural filtering system but will also provide vital 
habitat for fish and wildlife, as well as for recreation areas for generations 
to come.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">American Forests used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and its 
unique CITYgreen software to measure the region’s urban forest and values. The 
data prepared for the analysis is available to city and county governments. 
American Forests recommends they use it to conduct more detailed, 
neighborhood-level analyses to measure their urban ecological values and better 
incorporate environmental systems into their planning processes. Healthy cities 
should have an average tree canopy coverage of 40 percent to ensure their 
ecological, economic and social sustainability. Rural areas should set a goal of 
at least 50 percent.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Understanding the changes we've made on the landscape helps us 
understand how we can take steps to revitalize it,&quot; said Deborah Gangloff, 
American Forests executive director. &quot;We do know that planting trees is one 
of the most cost-effective ways to capitalize on the natural services provided 
by healthy ecosystems.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The study, which underpins <I>Global ReLeaf for the Chesapeake Bay</I>, a 
major cooperative tree-planting campaign of American Forests, is sponsored by 
the USDA Forest Service, Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, Henry M. 
Jackson Foundation, Virginia Department of Forestry, NRCS Washington DC 
Initiative, District of Columbia, Fairfax County, Arlington County, ESRI for GIS 
software, and ERDAS for remote sensing software. The campaign is supported by 
specialty retailer Eddie Bauer, Mobil Corporation, Exxon Corporation, and Spring 
Creek Foundation. The campaign was launched last April as part of American 
Forests’ Global ReLeaf 2000 campaign to plant 20 million trees for the new 
millennium. American Forests has committed to 
planting one million trees in the Bay watershed in support of the President’s 
Clean Water Action Plan and the regional Riparian Forest Buffer Initiative (RFBI) to create 2,010 miles of streamside forests by 2010. The RFBI is 
coordinated by the Chesapeake Bay Program: a partnership between the EPA; the 
states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; the District of Columbia; the 
Chesapeake Bay Commission; and advisory groups.</font></P>
