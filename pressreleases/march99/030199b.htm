<font face="Arial">Preventable adverse drug reactions afflict more than 2 million Americans, kill 
100,000 and hospitalize 1.5 million every year, partly because people do not 
know how to protect themselves from dangerous drugs or drug combinations, 
consumer group Public Citizen said today.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">    Americans fill more than 2.3 billion drug prescriptions each year, but 
weakened federal oversight and an onslaught of drug industry advertising have 
left consumers treading through a pharmaceutical minefield -- with nightmarish 
consequences for thousands of patients who suffer adverse reactions to drugs, 
said the group.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">    &quot;This is a national epidemic. The pharmaceutical industry has 
succeeded in intimidating the Food and Drug Administration into approving record 
numbers of drugs that either offer no significant benefit over drugs already on 
the market or have dangerous side effects,&quot; said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, 
director of Public Citizen’s <A href="http://www.citizen.org/hrg/">Health Research Group.</A></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">    To help patients use prescription and over-the-counter drugs more safely, 
Wolfe and the staff of Health Research Group have produced<I> <A 
href="http://www.worstpills.org">Worst Pills, Best Pills: A Consumer’s Guide to 
Avoiding Drug-Induced Death or Illness. </A></I></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">    The $16 book includes in-depth profiles, including potential risks, of 
456 of the most commonly used drugs, categorized by the type of treatment for 
which they are prescribed. It also lists 160 drugs that patients should not take 
at all -- either because they are too dangerous or because they are ineffective 
-- and provides safer alternatives.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">    &quot;The whole system is stacked against patients,&quot; Wolfe said. 
&quot;Drug companies, doctors and pharmacists are too often making decisions 
that ultimately derive from what is best for the drug companies, doctors and 
pharmacists -- not what is necessarily best for the patient. This book has been 
written to help consumers come out ahead in the struggle with our health care 
system.&quot;</font></P><I>
<P><font face="Arial">Worst Pills, Best Pills</font></I><font face="Arial"> includes separate chapters instructing readers on 
how to protect themselves from preventable drug-induced injury and how to save 
money on prescription drugs.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Wolfe blames the epidemic of adverse drug reactions on:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><font face="Arial">The pharmaceutical industry, which spends $12 billion a year to promote 
drugs to doctors and to consumers directly through advertisements on television 
and in newspapers and magazines. The industry has pressured Congress to weaken 
FDA reviews and approvals of new drugs, the monitoring of drugs already on the 
market and the oversight of the industry’s advertising claims.</font> </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font face="Arial">The FDA, which has bent over backward to approve new drugs. In 1996 and 1997 
the agency approved more drugs than had ever been approved in any two-year 
period. Thousands of people were injured or killed after taking three of the 
drugs approved during that period -- Duract, Redux and Posicor, all of which 
have been taken off the market. A recent Public Citizen study showed that 19 FDA 
medical officers -- the officials in charge of reviewing new drugs -- identified 
a total of 27 approved drugs in the past three years that they reviewed that 
they thought should not have been approved.</font> </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font face="Arial">Physicians who misprescribe drugs; prescribe drugs in dangerous 
combinations; treat adverse drug reactions with more drugs; fail to identify 
non-drug treatments for some conditions; or prescribe dangerous drugs when safer 
alternatives are available.</font> </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial">    Of the 2.3 billion prescriptions written per year, hundreds of millions 
are simply not needed, Wolfe said. For example, 23 million prescriptions are 
written each year for colds, bronchitis and upper respiratory infections -- all 
caused by viruses but treated with antibiotics that have no effect on the 
underlying cause. This accounts for one-fifth of all prescriptions for 
antibiotics. Wolfe cites another study showing that 47 percent of people 
admitted to a nursing home who were taking the heart drug digoxin did not have 
the problem for which it was prescribed.</font></P>
