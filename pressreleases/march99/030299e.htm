        YORK
        - March 2- </font>
Demonstrators will march through downtown Brooklyn March 5 in support of 
long-time war tax resister Ed Hedemann and in opposition to U.S. militarism. 
<BR><BR>Since 1972, Hedemann has protested the use of federal income taxes to 
finance war and weapons by paying to nonprofit groups and agencies the entire 
amount due on his federal income taxes. &quot;As a pacifist,&quot; he explains, 
&quot;I can't support any institution that is dedicated to killing and 
destruction.&quot; Now he's being sued in federal court by the IRS to force him 
to turn over his financial documents. A first hearing is scheduled for March 5, 
the day of the planned protest.<BR><BR>The protest has been organized by the War 
Resisters League, a 75-year-old pacifist organization. Each year the War 
Resisters League publishes &quot;Where Your Income Tax Money Goes,&quot; a 
pamphlet featuring a pie-chart graph of the new federal budget. The pie chart 
has shown the majority of federal tax monies going to the Pentagon. The 
organization therefore supports war tax resisters who, like Hedemann, refuse to 
contribute to what they see as a death machine.<BR><BR>Last December 11, against 
the backdrop of renewed U.S. air strikes against Iraq, Hedemann was served with 
an Order to Show Cause why he should not be compelled to turn over his financial 
records to the IRS. Just days after unleashing the largest military action since 
the Gulf War, which took nearly 2,000 Iraqi lives and cost U.S. taxpayers more 
than $500 million, President Clinton asked Congress for an additional $100 
billion for the Pentagon over the next six years. &quot;This is the largest 
military build-up since the unprecedented peace-time military spending of the 
Reagan era,&quot; comments Ruth Benn, Director of the WRL National 
Office.<BR><BR>Hedemann began withholding federal taxes in 1972 as a protest 
against the Vietnam War. He has continued the practice since then because, he 
says, &quot;Fifty to 65 percent of federal income taxes have been spent on 
present and past military programs through the Department of Defense and related 
agencies.&quot; Since he began refusing to pay the IRS, he says the agency has 
&quot;routinely sent me threatening notices and levies, called me at home, 
harassed organizations I work for and looked for nonexistent bank accounts and 
property. But this is the first time they've ever taken me to court. I guess 
they're in desperate need of more money to pay for all those cruise 
missiles.&quot;<BR><BR>There are an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people in the U.S. 
who are refusing to pay some or all of their federal taxes because of opposition 
to war. In the past 30 years only a half dozen war tax resisters have been taken 
to court; the last such case was nine years ago.<BR><BR>Hedemann files all his 
tax returns, and pays state, local, and social security taxes. But when he files 
his federal returns, he sends, instead of a check, a note of explanation as to 
why he is sending the entire amount due to organizations such as Voices in the 
Wilderness, which provides material aid to Iraqi civilians; the New York Times 
Neediest Cases fund; and a documentary film project on the U.S.-aided murder of 
Jesuit priests in El Salvador.<BR><BR>The planned march will pass both the 
military recruiting center and the IRS office in downtown Brooklyn, showing the 
multiple ways that militarism impacts the lives of ordinary New Yorkers. 
<BR><BR>A spokesperson for the War Resisters League said, &quot;While Army and 
Navy recruiters are redoubling their efforts to attract young people to the 
military and the US is engaged in a slow motion war against the people of Iraq, 
the reasons for war tax resistance are painfully clear. The Pentagon would 
rather address global problems with cruise missiles than diplomacy while the 
dollars it consumes are desperately needed by communities here at 
home.&quot;<BR><BR><BR>Schedule:<BR>11 am Gathering at Atlantic Avenue and State 
Street<BR>Leaflet in front of U.S. military recruiters at Flatbush Avenue and 
State Street<BR>Walk along Flatbush to IRS Building at 625 Fulton 
Street<BR>Leaflet on Fulton Street<BR>Walk on Court Street to Federal 
Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza<BR><BR>1 pm U.S. v Hedemann hearing begins, 6th 
floor, Courtroom 8.<BR></font>
