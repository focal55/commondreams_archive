        - March 9 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">More than 50 scientists and 41 health, consumer, and other groups today called 
on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of certain antibiotics 
to fatten livestock. In a letter and petition to the FDA, the groups charged 
that feeding antibiotics to livestock endangers the value of those drugs for 
treating life-threatening diseases in humans.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For more than 40 years, ranchers and growers have been feeding low levels of 
penicillin, tetracycline, and other antibiotics to poultry, cattle, and pigs to 
speed growth and cut costs. That use accounts for about a third of all 
antibiotics sold in the U.S. Scientists worldwide have decried the use of 
antibiotics to promote animal growth because it increases the prevalence of 
bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics' effects and jeopardizes human 
health.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Michael F. Jacobson, Ph.D., 
executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said: 
“Agribusiness is recklessly squandering one of the only weapons against deadly 
bacteria. That industry continues to oppose tighter regulations even though new 
drug-resistant strains of bacteria are becoming a serious public-health hazard.”</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">CSPI staff scientist Patricia Lieberman, Ph.D., added, “The U.S. is one of 
the only developed nations that still allows the ‘subtherapeutic' use of 
important human-use antibiotics to promote the growth of livestock. For the sake 
of the public's health, it's high time that the FDA kicked livestock off the 
drug habit.”</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the past two years, the World Health Organization and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention have called for ending the use of several 
antibiotics for growth promotion in livestock.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">“I've seen hospital patients die due to antibiotic-resistant infections,” 
said Dr. J. Glenn Morris, professor of medicine and head of the Division of 
Hospital Epidemiology at the University of Maryland. “To reduce rates of 
antibiotic resistance we've got to eliminate unnecessary uses of antibiotics in 
all settings: in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and on farms.”</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Bacteria can develop defense mechanisms (“resistance”) against one or several 
antibiotics. Those antibiotics are then useless in treating infections caused by 
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Adding antibiotics to livestock feed can lead to antibiotic resistance in 
foodborne pathogens. That can make cases of food poisoning difficult to treat or 
even deadly.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">One common form of food poisoning is caused by <I>Salmonella typhimurium</I>. 
The prevalence of <I>Salmonella typhimurium</I> infections that are resistant to 
five commonly used antibiotics has soared from less than 1% in 1979 to 34% in 
1996. Those infections — if they require treatment with antibiotics — are 
increasingly difficult to treat.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">New antibiotics also are jeopardized by the use of related antibiotics on 
farms. Synercid, for example, may become one of the only effective cures for 
deadly bloodstream infections. Although it has not yet been approved for use in 
humans, Synercid's value already has been compromised because a related drug,
virginiamycin, is fed to livestock. In the U.S., bacteria resistant to Synercid 
have been found in turkeys fed virginiamycin. In Germany, bacteria resistant to 
Synercid have been detected in humans even though the drug has not been given to 
people.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">“Decreasing the use of antibiotics in livestock feed can decrease the 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and does not adversely affect animal 
health,” Lieberman said. “For example, in Denmark, following a 1995 ban of the 
use of avoparcin to promote growth in chickens, the prevalence of 
antibiotic-resistant enterococci bacteria in chickens declined from 82% to 12% 
in three years.”</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Environmental Defense Fund, Union for Concerned Scientists, Public 
Citizen’s Health Research Group, and Food Animal Concerns Trust joined CSPI in 
petitioning the FDA. Other groups that advocate the ban include the American 
Public Health Association, American Medical Women’s Association, and Association 
of State and Territorial Health Officials. Scientists supporting the petition 
include Nobel-laureate Joshua Lederberg, Ph.D., Rockefeller University; Dr. 
Robert Baltimore, Yale University School of Medicine; Stanley Falkow, Ph.D., 
Stanford University; and Dr. Joyce Lashof, University of California, Berkeley.</font>
