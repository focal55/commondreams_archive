<I><font face="Arial">&quot; My feet were still shackled together, and I couldn't get my legs 
apart. The doctor called for the officer ... No one else could unlock the 
shackles, and my baby was coming ... Finally the officer came and unlocked the 
shackles from my ankles. My baby was born then.&quot;</font></I>
<P><font face="Arial">(&quot;Maria Jones&quot; describing how she gave birth while an inmate of 
Cook County Jail, Chicago, 1998)</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">The use of shackles on pregnant inmates is just one example of the cruelty 
and ill-treatment many women suffer in US jails and prisons, Amnesty 
International said today in a new report issued as part of its international 
campaign against human rights violations in the USA.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">As well as the use of restraints on pregnant and sick prisoners, Amnesty 
International's report -- &quot;Not part of my sentence&quot;-- details human 
rights violations including sexual abuse, lack of medical care and lengthy 
periods of confinement in so-called super-maximum units.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">Reports of rape and other forms of sexual abuse -- including sexually 
offensive language and male staff touching women's breasts and genitals during 
searches or watching them when they are naked -- are widespread in US prisons 
and jails.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">&quot;Cases of sexual abuse actually reported are probably only the tip of 
the iceberg as victims are often reluctant to complain for fear of not being 
believed or suffering retaliation,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">&quot;The overwhelming majority of complaints concern male staff, reflecting 
the fact that many guards and other prison employees are male,&quot; the 
organization added.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">The number of women in US jails and prisons has been growing dramatically, 
largely as a result of the war on drugs. In 1997 the figure was at 138,000 -- a 
three-fold increase since 1985. This amounts to about 10 times the number of 
women prisoners in Western European countries, which combined have a female 
population the same size as the USA.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">&quot;Authorities around the USA have been spending large sums of money 
building new prisons and jails but have not provided adequate funds for the 
health, welfare and rehabilitation of the people they are locking up,&quot; 
Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">As the world celebrates International Women's Day on 8 March, Amnesty 
International is calling on US federal, state and local authorities to make a 
strong commitment to implement the measures required to effectively protect the 
safety, health and dignity of all women in custody.</font> 
<P><B><font face="Arial">Concerns expressed in the report include: </font> </B>
<P><font face="Arial">·Sexual abuse: rape of an inmate by staff is internationally recognized as a 
form of torture and violates US federal and state criminal laws, yet reports of 
rape and other forms of sexual abuse are common in US prisons and jails. Amnesty 
International is calling for female inmates to be supervised by female staff 
only, and for victims to be more effectively protected from retaliation if they 
report abuses.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">·Medical care: access to a doctor is often conditional on permission by 
non-medical staff, who may underestimate the seriousness of the case or be 
inclined not to believe inmates. In some cases, delays are reported to have had 
serious health consequences. In 1998 an inmate in an Arizona Jail wrote to 
Amnesty International reporting that she had lost her baby -- and almost bled to 
death -- after her call for urgent medical attention was left unheeded for 
hours. Amnesty International is urging that all women in custody have access to 
free and adequate medical care.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">·Mental health care: there are concerns about the use of psychotropic drugs 
and a reported lack of counseling. Amnesty International is calling for an 
inquiry into prison mental health services and for women suffering from severe 
mental illnesses to be transferred to mental health institutions.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">·Use of physical restraints on sick and pregnant women: handcuffs and 
shackles are often used on women both during transport and in hospital even if 
they do not have a history of violence or escape. In the case of pregnant women, 
restraints pose a serious health threat. Amnesty International is calling for 
the use of restraints to be limited to cases in which the inmates' conduct makes 
them necessary.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial">· Super-maximum security units: some women appear to be sent to such units -- 
where conditions are particularly harsh -- for comparatively minor infractions. 
Some of the rules in those units -- such as the one requiring that prisoners be 
&quot;in full view&quot; all the time --violate the inmates' privacy and 
dignity, and their isolated nature can increase the opportunities for abuse.</font></P>
