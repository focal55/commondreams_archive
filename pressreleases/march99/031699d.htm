        - March 16 - </font><FONT face=Arial size="2">A new study of privately managed individual retirement 
accounts in the United Kingdom shows that more than 40 percent of their value is 
consumed by administrative fees and other costs, a figure that is 
&quot;significantly higher than acknowledged thus far in the debate in the 
United States, although not as high as some other studies from the United 
Kingdom have suggested.&quot;</FONT>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report, <EM>&quot;<A 
href="http://www.cbpp.org/3-16-99socsec.pdf">Administrative 
Costs in Individual Accounts in the United Kingdom</A>,&quot;</EM> released today by the <A 
href="http://www.cbpp.org">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</A>, is based 
on a World Bank research project undertaken by three economists. As part of that 
project, the economists constructed a comprehensive database on administrative 
and other costs of individual accounts in the U.K. system, compiled on a 
company-by-company basis.</font></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">As a result, unlike the findings of other reports, 
&quot;This estimate reflects a comprehensive treatment of costs associated with 
individual accounts and is based on actual data from financial providers,&quot; 
said the study's author, <A 
href="http://www.sbgo.com">Dr. Peter R. Orszag</A>, one of the three economists 
who conducted the underlying research. Orszag teaches economics at the 
University of California at Berkeley and was formerly a Senior Economist on the 
Council of Economic Advisers. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The study comes as Congress is debating options for Social 
Security reform in the United States, including proposals to allow individuals 
to opt out of the Social Security system and into individual 
accounts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Some proposals before Congress would set up a centralized 
plan for individual accounts with investment options that are limited to a few 
broadly diversified index funds and managed by a single provider, along the 
lines of the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. Other proposals would 
use a decentralized approach, under which individuals choose their own private 
financial providers and invest in a wide range of assets, like the current 
Individual Retirement Accounts available to U.S. workers not otherwise covered 
by pension plans.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The U.K. experience &quot;vividly illustrates...that if 
individual accounts are created in the United States, a decentralized approach 
could carry a variety of potential dangers. In particular, the U.K. data suggest 
that administrative costs could prove surprisingly high under a decentralized 
approach,&quot; Orszag said.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Orszag emphasized that administrative costs &quot;depend on 
the structure of individual accounts.&quot; He said that costs would be lower 
under a system of individual accounts that took advantage of potential economies 
of scale through centralized management, as seen in the Thrift Savings Plan for 
federal employees.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The Social Security system in the United Kingdom consists of 
two tiers, a flat-rate basic state pension and an earnings-related pension. The 
first tier is provided through the government to all workers who have 
contributed to the system for a sufficient number of years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">At the individual's option, the second, earnings-related 
tier can be an employer-based pension, a retirement benefit provided through the 
government, or a privately managed individual account.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">In the World Bank research, Orszag — along with Dr. Mamta 
Murthi of Cambridge University and Dr. Michael Orszag of the University of 
London — uses data from financial providers to examine the lifetime costs on a 
private individual account over a 40-year span for a typical U.K. worker. The 
new report examines the full range of costs imposed on account holders and 
expresses them in a &quot;simple, comprehensive way by measuring how much of an 
individual account's value is dissipated by costs over a working 
life.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The report released today, <EM>&quot;<A 
href="http://www.cbpp.org/3-16-99socsec-exec.htm">Administrative Costs in 
Individual Accounts in the United Kingdom</A>,&quot;</EM> breaks the costs 
associated with individual retirements accounts into three categories:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size="2">Accumulation costs, which reflect the costs for 
administration and fund management — including advertising and marketing — that 
are incurred on the accounts kept by workers whose accounts remain with the same 
company for 40 years and who contribute consistently to that account throughout 
their careers. These costs reduce the value of an individual account in the 
United Kingdom by approximately 25 percent.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size="2">Costs incurred when an account holder switches from one 
financial provider to another or leaves the workforce and ceases to make 
contributions. These costs, termed &quot;alteration costs&quot; in the report, 
reduce an account's value in the U.K. by an average of at least 15 percent over 
a career. Although these costs are significant, most previous studies have 
overlooked them.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size="2">Annuity costs, incurred by the typical individual in 
converting an account to a lifetime annuity upon retirement. These costs reduce 
an average account's value by about 10 percent.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Taking into account interaction effects, on average &quot;43 
percent of the value of individual accounts in the United Kingdom is consumed by 
various fees and costs over a typical career...&quot; Orszag found. That finding 
is consistent with other studies from the United Kingdom, including one 
published in the respected U.K. financial publication Money Management, which 
found that accumulation and alteration costs alone would amount to about 42 
percent of an account's value over a typical 40-year term. Orszag added that 
some other previous estimates of administrative costs in the U.K. system failed 
to consider alteration costs and therefore underestimated the total 
costs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The report released today suggests that the high costs 
associated with individual accounts in the United Kingdom are intrinsic to a 
privately managed, decentralized system and are not the result of excessive 
profits taken by financial providers. This conclusion is based on the 
competitiveness of the individual account markets in the United Kingdom and the 
departure of some providers from that market.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Orszag said the lesson of the study is that, &quot;In 
addition to considering the broader question of whether to create individual 
accounts, policymakers in the United States must consider what type of 
individual accounts to create if they decide to adopt such accounts. The 
decision on what type of accounts to create will have a large bearing on how 
much of the accounts is consumed by administrative fees and other 
costs.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Orszag noted that this question applies both to individual 
accounts that could replace part of Social Security and to individual accounts 
created outside the Social Security structure, such as the USA accounts the 
Clinton Administration has proposed.</FONT></P>
