        YORK - March 5 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">On Tuesday, March 2, 1999, the Federal Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit 
ruled that US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements for highway 
project approvals violate the Clean Air Act. The ruling appears likely to stop 
funding for major road projects in a number of metropolitan areas that have 
failed to revise their regional transportation plans to meet motor vehicle 
emission targets set by states under the Clean Air Act. The decision requires 
compliance with requirements enacted in 1990 to hold transportation agencies 
accountable for air pollution from automobile use across America. The appeal 
from EPA's transportation planning rules was filed by the Environmental Defense 
Fund (EDF).</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Court struck down a rule allowing planned highway projects to be 
guaranteed future funding many years in advance of construction even if the 
transportation plan for the metropolitan area no longer meets Clean Air Act 
requirements when construction funds are to be spent. The Act requires cities 
with harmful pollution levels to adopt 20-year transportation plans that will 
achieve regional limits on emissions from motor vehicles adopted in a state's 
air pollution control plan. This decision will insure that federal funds may 
only be spent on highway projects that do not interfere with a metropolitan 
area's pollution cleanup plan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This Court ruling protects the public from highway projects that will 
contribute excess pollution in areas that violate national air quality 
standards,&quot; said Michael Replogle, EDF's federal transportation director. 
&quot;Road project sponsors will need to demonstrate that their projects comply 
with state air quality plans, and do not promote sprawl and development that 
worsens air pollution and transportation equity problems. As a result of the 
decision, highway funds may be committed to a project only if the area's 
transportation plan meets air quality requirements when the project is ready to 
begin construction, and not many years in advance. This will encourage 
transportation agencies to pay more attention to the effects of their plans and 
avoid the mistakes of Atlanta, where authorities approved over $700 million in 
road projects after it was known that the projects would add to excess pollution 
levels. Tuesday's decision would require Atlanta to change its transportation 
plan to cut air pollution before spending more on highway projects. These funds 
should be used immediately to alleviate the harmful effects of past 
transportation investments on communities and to boost job access for low income 
workers.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The ruling is likely to affect &quot;grandfathered&quot; road projects in 
other regions where plans are not in compliance with federal Clean Air Act 
requirements. These areas include Charlotte (NC), Northwest Indiana, Boise (ID), 
Kent County (DE), Monterey and Santa Barbara (CA), Ft. Collins (CO), Albuquerque 
(NM), Billings (MT), Medford (OR), Northern New Jersey, and Puerto Rico. The DC 
Circuit ruling would mean these plans must be revised to shift funds to projects 
that will contribute to reducing pollution.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;When Congress enacted these provisions of the Clean Air Act in 1990, it 
sought to insure that billions in US transportation funding would not add to air 
pollution while other government agencies were requiring emission reductions to 
protect public health,&quot; said Robert Yuhnke, EDF's attorney in the case. 
&quot;This ruling helps assure transportation funds will be part of the solution 
in seriously polluted metropolitan areas, not part of the problem.&quot;</font>

organization, represents 300,000 members. EDF links science, economics, and law 
to create innovative, equitable, and economically viable solutions to today's 
environmental problems.</font></P>
