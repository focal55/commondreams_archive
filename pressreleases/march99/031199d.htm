      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - March 11 - </font>Members of Congress announced the upcoming introduction of the
        Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) today at a bipartisan press conference on
        Capitol Hill.  The HCPA would extend current federal hate crimes protection to
        cover gender, sexual orientation and disability.  In the wake of several
        high-profile, brutal hate crimes in the past year, the Hate Crimes Prevention
        Act will help send a clear message that hate motivated violence is unacceptable
        and un-American, according to the Human Rights Campaign.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    The Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a key component of the effort to reduce
hate crimes, and it sends the message that hate-motivated violence against minorities has no place in America, said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The murders of James Byrd, Matthew Shepard and Billy Jack Gaither highlight the
need for Congress to pass this legislation and make it clear that our nation must no longer ignore this growing problem.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    The press conference featured nine congressional co-sponsors:
Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.;  Ron Wyden, D-Ore.; Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.; Arlen Specter,
R-Pa.; Gordon Smith, R-Ore.; and Reps. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y.; John Conyers,
D-Mich.; House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; and Constance A. Morella,
R-Md.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Members of Congress pointed out that while crime continues to decrease
nationally, hate crimes based on sexual orientation were up 8 percent in 1997, according to the latest FBI statistics. Sexual orientation was the third highest
category of hate crimes behind race and religion and represented 14 percent of all hate crimes reported.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    Calls for passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act accelerated in the
aftermath of three  brutal murders that rocked the nation.  Last year, white supremacists dragged James Byrd to death behind a pick-up truck in Jasper,
Texas.  University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was killed in Laramie, Wyo. last fall in part because he was gay.  Two men beat Shepard, tied him to a
fence and left him to die in freezing weather. On Feb. 19, Billy Jack Gaither, 39, was lured from a bar by two men, beaten to death and burned on a pile of
tires in Sylacauga, Ala.  Two men, Charles Monroe Butler, 21, and Steven Eric Mullins, 25, confessed to killing Gaither because he was a homosexual Coosa
County Sheriff’s Deputy Al Bradley told the Associated Press.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    Currently, hate crimes monitoring and enforcement consists of a patchwork of
laws that offer citizens varying levels of legal protection depending on where they live. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have hate crimes laws
that include sexual orientation.  Twenty one states have laws that do not include sexual orientation.  Eight states have no hate crimes laws at all.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    Hate crimes against gay and lesbian Americans are rapidly increasing as more
people choose to live their lives openly and honestly, said HRC Political Director Winnie
Stachelberg.   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act is needed to stem the tide of this alarming trend and to bring uniformity to the maze of state
laws that exist today.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    The Hate Crimes Prevention Act will also allow local law enforcement
authorities to utilize federal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.  This key aspect of HCPA is why it has broad support from
notable law enforcement agencies and state and local leaders, including 22 state
attorneys general, the National Sheriffs Association, the Police Foundation, former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    While high-profile cases such as Shepard’s and Gaither’s gain a lot of
publicity, anti-gay violence is far from uncommon. A study released in August by</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Karen Franklin, a forensic psychologist at the Washington Institute for
Mental Illness Research and Training, suggests that harassment and hate crimes against gay students by their peers is commonplace.  According to the study,
nearly one-quarter of community college students who took part in this survey admitted to harassing people they thought were gay.  Among men, 18 percent said
they had physically assaulted or threatened someone they thought was gay or lesbian.  And 32 percent admitted they were guilty of verbal harassment.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    An October 1998 CNN/Time poll found that 75 percent of Americans think
violence against gay Americans is a serious problem across the country.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the survey, 68 percent of those polled said a similar attack could
happen in their community.  And 39 percent said anti-gay violence is a very serious problem, while 36 percent said it is a serious problem.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    Two federal hate crimes laws include sexual orientation as a protected
group. The Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990 requires the FBI to collect statistics on bias-motivated crimes.  The Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act
of 1995 provides for tougher sentencing when it is proven that the crime committed was motivated by bias.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">    The Human Rights Campaign is the nation’s largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country, effectively lobbies
Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in
the community.</font></P>
