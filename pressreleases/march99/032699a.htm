- </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">March 26 - </font>Insurance companies have paid out $91.8 billion in losses from 
weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s so far, close to four times the 
weather-related claims handed out during the entire decade of the 1980s. At $15 
billion, weather-related insured losses in 1998 were second only to the $25 
billion recorded in 1992, according to the recently compiled estimates from the 
German reinsurance company Munich Re.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The rising insurance claims of the last decade have coincided with rises in 
global temperatures: six of the ten warmest years on record have occurred since 
1990. The increasing toll of claims has already raised premiums and made it 
difficult to obtain insurance in disaster-prone areas such as the Caribbean. If 
these trends continue, insurance coverage could become unaffordable or even 
unavailable to property owners and businesses living in these and other 
high-risk areas--particularly coastal regions and islands. Taxpayers may also 
have to foot the bill to help insurance companies fend off overexposure or 
insolvency, as they are now in Florida.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The largest insurance claims of 1998 were from Hurricane Georges, which hit 
the United States and the Caribbean, costing insurers $3.3 billion; from the ice 
storm that swept across the U.S. and Canada, bringing $1.2 billion in insured 
damages; and from flooding in China, which cost the industry $1 billion.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Munich Re estimated in its 1998 year-end report that the number of natural 
catastrophes has tripled since the 1960s, increasing the overall cost to the 
world's economies nine-fold, and the cost to the insurance industry 
fifteen-fold. Munich Re attributes this large increase to the growing 
concentrations of people and property in coastal regions and other 
&quot;high-risk zones,&quot; as well as to climate change. Scientists now 
believe that rising global temperatures may exacerbate extreme weather events, 
leading to increased damages in the decades ahead.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Climate change has added a new element of risk to the insurance equation. 
Rising temperatures increase the amount of evaporation from the oceans, which 
tends to increase rainfall in many flood-prone areas. In addition, higher 
temperatures add to the heat energy that fuels thunderstorms, tornadoes, and 
hurricanes. Gerhard Berz of Munich Re recently said, &quot;A further advance in 
man-made climate change will almost invariably bring us increasingly extreme 
natural events and consequently increasingly large catastrophe losses.&quot;</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another factor in the escalating cost of insured losses has been the effort 
of governments and insurers in industrial nations to make inexpensive insurance 
protection widely available, encouraging a coastal migration trend that has 
dramatically increased the amount and value of property at risk to storm 
damages. Research by the reinsurance company Swiss Re indicates that the 
relatively catastrophe-free years of the 1960s and 1970s gave property owners a 
sense of complacency, leading them to build heavily in disaster-prone areas. 
Some $2 trillion in insured property now lies within 30 kilometers of coasts 
exposed to Atlantic hurricanes.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Recent studies find that a single weather-related catastrophe could endanger 
the solvency of many insurance companies. A computer simulation by the Arkwright 
Mutual Insurance Company, presented at the annual meeting of the American 
Meteorological Society in 1998, indicates that the U.S. East Coast is exposed to 
&quot;unprecedented hurricane damage&quot; due to explosive coastal property 
growth that coincided with unusually low hurricane activity between 1940 and 
1990. The study estimates the Eastern U.S. could face hurricane losses of $50 to 
$100 billion, placing numerous insurers and reinsurers in danger of insolvency. 
Citing the president of a reinsurance industry group who believes that a $50 
billion hurricane would exceed the financial capabilities of the insurance 
industry, the Arkwright report concludes: &quot;we are...an industry with a 
disaster waiting to happen.&quot;</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A 1998 study by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) emphasizes the growing vulnerability of populations and property to 
hurricanes. Comparing normalized hurricane damages between 1925 and 1995, the 
report concludes &quot;it is only a matter of time before the nation experiences 
a $50 billion or greater storm, with multi-billion dollar losses becoming 
increasingly frequent.&quot; According to NOAA research released this past 
January, the U.S. has already seen 37 &quot;billion-dollar storms&quot; since 
1980 -- 31 of them since 1988 -- totaling $160 billion in damages.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The danger to insurers of higher storm damages has led to the emergence, in 
private financial markets, of &quot;catastrophe bonds&quot; and other means of 
hedging risks that the insurance industry will not cover. Meanwhile, the 
insurers and reinsurers that have traditionally resisted government attempts to 
regulate the private insurance market are now looking to the public sector for 
help. Last year, industry representatives testified before the U.S. Congress, 
calling on the federal government to provide a &quot;backstop&quot; of 
reinsurance protection for states and insurers in the event of natural disasters 
that yield damage claims beyond their financial resources. As a representative 
of the American Insurance Association told Congress, the U.S. economy and 
insurance industry are &quot;simply not prepared&quot; for a massive hurricane 
and its socioeconomic effects.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Florida State legislature is also appealing to the federal government to 
create a natural hazards insurance program to provide reinsurance for 
catastrophic events. A 1998 working paper from the Natural Hazards Center at the 
University of Colorado, Boulder reveals that Florida is still in the midst of an 
insurance crisis six years after experiencing the largest insured loss event in 
history, Hurricane Andrew, which caused $16 billion in insured losses. Andrew 
left seven insurance companies insolvent, and led 44 to reduce their exposure by 
reducing coverage and raising premium levels. Thousands of people were left 
without insurance and unable to collect claims, and many insurers sought to 
leave the state. To ensure available and affordable coverage, the state 
government has established a public underwriting agency, now the state's second 
largest insurer, and created funds to cover insurers for hurricane catastrophes 
and homeowners for wind damages. As a result, Florida taxpayers are now 
underwriting at-risk homeowners who private insurers are unwilling to cover, 
reinsuring insurers against weather-related catastrophes, and propping up the 
state's home building industry and its relentless construction in high-wind risk 
areas.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last year's weather-related losses for the insurance industry would have been 
much higher had the largest events--the Yangtze floods and Hurricane Mitch, 
which together cost $35 billion--not occurred in poor regions with minimal 
insurance coverage. Developing nations, where some of the most severe disasters 
of the last few years have occurred, have little insurance today, and could find 
it hard to achieve widespread affordable property insurance if they continue to 
be plagued by disruptions of this scale. In China, the Yangtze floods displaced 
223 million people--close to the entire U.S. population.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As developing nations attempt to build an infrastructure and economic base, 
some may find insurance rates prohibitive because of their demonstrated 
vulnerability to extreme weather events. Already, many insurers have raised 
premium rates for, and some have withdrawn property insurance entirely from, 
islands like Jamaica following the destructive hurricane Hugo of the late 1980s. 
Increasingly hazard-prone regions in the Caribbean as well as the Pacific are 
finding insurance very expensive or impossible to obtain.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many poor, low-lying islands and coastal nations in the Caribbean, Indian, 
and Pacific Oceans depend on insurance to attract investment in their tourism 
sectors, which account for as much as 70 percent of their gross national 
products. These nations, highly susceptible to rising sea levels and storm 
surges, may see their real estate values drop as investment patterns shift in 
response to the reduced availability and affordability of property insurance. 
The banking industry has already seen the withdrawal of coverage for properties 
on small islands that were being considered for long-term financial investments. 
Heavy uninsured losses may also bring loan defaults, and because property is 
often used as security for loans, some experts fear falling property values 
could trigger a &quot;credit famine&quot; in local economies. As storms become 
more frequent and intense, phenomena like these may spread to other parts of the 
world.</font>
