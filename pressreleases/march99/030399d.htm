        - March 3 - </font>

        On the eve of his meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, jailed East Timorese rebel Xanana Gusmao said the
        United States should cut off all training, weapons and ammunition sales to
        Indonesia, and called on Washington to pressure the Indonesian government
        to withdraw its military intelligence service from East Timor, which he blames for the establishment of paramilitary groups in the occupied territory.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In his first US radio interview since his 1992 arrest, given to Pacifica
Radio's Democracy Now! from Jakarta, Gusmao said that US military training and weapons sales to the Indonesian military is "preparing Indonesian
killers to go to East Timor and kill East Timorese people." He added that US military education and weapons had played a part in the torture, killing
and jailing of the Timorese population during the brutal 23-year Indonesian occupation of East Timor.
Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill) are introducing a bill in Congress this week that would cut off all US military training to
Indonesia.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Asked if he believed that Indonesia would deliver on its promise to grant
independence to East Timor if the Timorese rejected the option of becoming an autonomous region of Indonesia, Gusmao said that "President Habibie has
to be aware that he has made a commitment to the international community," and so he was "not worried" that Indonesia would withdraw its promise to
the Timorese.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Gusmao also told Pacifica Radio that if the east Timorese population is
given the choice between autonomy and independence, "I am sure that they will choose independence." He added that he is in favor of forming a
democratically-elected consultative assembly, which he said would "decide if east Timor accepts or rejects the question of autonomy" versus
independence.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Gusmao said that the withdrawal of the Indonesian military and the
disarmament of FALINTIL, the Timorese guerrilla group that he heads "must be enforced by a United Nations police force," which would then remain in
East Timor for another six months to help "consolidate mutual confidence between the East
Timorese.&quot; He said that the UN police force would assist in forming a new Timorese police force, composed of former guerrilla
independence combatants, as well as Timorese who worked for the Indonesian military.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Timorese rebel leader also reiterated charges that the Indonesian
military intelligence is responsible for recent violence in East Timor, as well as the creation of paramilitary units in the territory. He said that
the military intelligence service "gives weapons to the population" to promote instability and to "give the appearance that there would be a civil
war" if east Timor were given independence.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Summing up 23 years of brutal military repression by Indonesia, which has
killed an estimated one-third of East Timor's population, Gusmao said that Indonesia's military had attacked the population and conducted massacres
because they "wrongly thought they could crush the spirit of the East Timorese.&quot; Instead, he said, "the military occupation has united the East&nbsp;
Timorese, consolidated the nationalist spirit and created stronger patriotism."</font></P>
