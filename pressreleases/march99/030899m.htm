        - March 8 - </font>The Sierra Club today welcomed parts of the Clinton Administration's plan to curb water pollution from Confined Animal
        Feeding Operations (CAFOs), but expressed disappointment that the proposal doesn't go farther to clean up the industry's practices.  The
        group applauded the Administration's proposal to hold corporate animal owners -- not just the farmers contracted to raise the pigs --
        responsible for waste spills and other pollution.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     In addition to holding corporate owners responsible for pollution, the
plan also earned praise for requiring all new CAFOs to obtain an operating permit.  On the other hand, the plan fails to protect
groundwater, curb air pollution, ensure citizens can participate in granting permits to new
CAFOs, and deal with pig factories' giant lagoons of raw manure.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "The Clinton Administration's proposal for livestock factories is a
mixed bag," said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.  "The Administration plan tackles a terrible problem, but fails to offer
solutions for the most troubling air and water pollution aspects of these livestock factories.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "Sierra Club is happy the government is acknowledging that the
corporate hog and poultry industries are polluters out of control who need to be reigned in," Pope continued.  "Sierra Club is particularly
pleased that the Clinton Administration will be holding corporate owners responsible for pollution -- that's one of the first important
steps toward cleaning up the livestock factory industry."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Currently, CAFOs contract small farmers to raise their animals, but
only the farmer is held responsible for the animals' waste.  Under the new plan, animal owners who have substantial control over the farmers'
practices would be prevented from passing the buck onto the small contractors.  Instead, the corporate owners would share responsibility
with the contract farmer for pollution clean-up.  In addition, the plan will require that new livestock factories obtain operating
permits.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "No longer will corporate factory farms be able to shirk
responsibility from cleaning up the pollution they created," said Hank</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Graddy, a Kentucky environmental leader who chairs Sierra Club's CAFO
campaign.  "Unfortunately, the Administration blew its opportunity to take other big steps to attack the pollution problem head on.  This
plan could have prevented environmental disasters before they happened, rather than just spreading the blame after the fact."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Of crucial importance is cleaning up the giant lagoons in which CAFOs
hold tens of millions of gallons of liquid hog manure -- an issue not addressed by the EPA plan.  This plan leaves the nation's groundwater
vulnerable to manure contamination from lagoons.  Spills from these lagoons pollute streams, and manure percolates into groundwater.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Until CAFOs use technology rather than lagoons to treat their manure,
our streams, air and drinking water will not be safe.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     These lagoons are built on an enormous scale, with one in Oklahoma
covering 11 acres and holding more than 42 million gallons of hog manure.  In 1995, a North Carolina lagoon burst, spilling 23 million
gallons of raw sewage into the New River -- an amount more than double the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  That spill obliterated the river's
aquatic life.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "When hundreds of thousands of pigs live in cramped quarters at a
livestock factory, they produce an enormous amount of waste, and that manure should not simply flow into huge lagoons to spoil our land, air
and water," Graddy said.  "We wouldn't allow a large city to pump its sewage into a giant lagoon and leave it there.  Just as America's
clean water laws require cities to treat human waste, we should require livestock factories to treat their manure."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Another shortcoming is that the plan does not guarantee that citizens
can participate in deciding whether to grant a permit for a new or larger CAFO in their community.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "When communities are faced with the prospect of having two Exxon
Valdezes worth of hog manure spill into their streams, they deserve some say in whether a livestock factory can be built nearby," Graddy
said.  "It's essential that citizens can participate in deciding whether or not they should have to breathe the stench of hog manure
day after day."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Sierra Club is continuing to call for a moratorium on new CAFOs until
tough clean air and water standards are in place and existing operations are brought under control.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "I'm disappointed that the Administration failed to order a moratorium
on new CAFOs,&quot; Graddy said.  "Livestock factories are fouling our air, polluting our water and poisoning the fish we eat.  We should not
subject rural communities to these monstrous livestock factories unless the Big Pig and Big Chicken owners agree to operate them
cleanly.  If you live downwind of a livestock factory, you can't open your windows on a hot summer day, hang the laundry or sit on your
porch.  And when millions of gallons of manure can seep into local wells, you certainly aren't going to trust your drinking water."</font></P>
