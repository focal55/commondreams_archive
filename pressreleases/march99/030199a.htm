        - March 1- </font>

<font face="Arial">
As the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty became binding international law today, Human Rights 
Watch praised the remarkable progress in eliminating antipersonnel landmines 
around the world. </font>

<P><font face="Arial">But it also questioned the sincerity of the United States in reaching its 
stated goal of signing the ban treaty by 2006.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">&quot;The goal of 2006 is already unconscionably distant,&quot; said Stephen 
Goose, Program Director for the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. &quot;But 
how can we believe the Pentagon is serious about that goal, if it's seeking 
nearly $50 million from Congress this year for a new mine system that will be 
banned by the treaty?&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Arial">The new system, called RADAM, will package together existing antipersonnel 
and antitank mines and will cost in excess of $200 million. If the U.S. is signs 
the treaty, it will be unable to use RADAM after 2006, and will then have to 
spend money to destroy it. Last May the U.S. said it would sign the treaty by 
2006, but only if the Pentagon's search for alternatives to mines was 
successful.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">&quot;RADAM is the latest of a growing number of indicators that the Pentagon 
is not serious about the 2006 deadline, and that it is very unlikely to be 
met,&quot; said Mr. Goose.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">The world is moving rapidly toward a ban without the United States: 134 
nations have signed the ban treaty (including all of NATO, except the U.S. and 
Turkey), and sixty-five nations have ratified. Ukraine, a nation with a 
stockpile of 10 million antipersonnel landmines -- nearly as many mines as in 
the U.S. stockpile -- signed the treaty last week.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">The landmines treaty has become binding international law more quickly than 
any major treaty in history. Global production is down significantly, global 
exports have been reduced to a trickle, more than 10 million antipersonnel mines 
have already been destroyed from stockpiles, and new use appears to be on the 
wane. There are still serious disappointments: the government of Angola -- a 
treaty signatory -- is once again laying mines, and very few nations from the 
Middle East and former Soviet Republics are willing to sign now.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">&quot;President Clinton needs to consider his legacy on the ban on 
antipersonnel landmines,&quot; said Mary Wareham, senior advocate for the Arms 
Division of Human Rights Watch. &quot;The U.S. has used some encouraging 
rhetoric, and it has spent a good deal of effort on clearing existing mines. But 
the U.S. will continue to be a disappointment until it signs the treaty and 
fully embraces the ban. The Clinton Administration should do that this 
year.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Arial">Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning 
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and serves as co-chair of the 
government task force of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines. Human Rights Watch 
is also coordinator of the Landmine Monitor initiative, a global network that 
reports on implementation of the treaty and on the humanitarian response to the 
global landmine crisis.</font>
<P><font face="Arial">The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty (also known as Ottawa Convention) comprehensively 
bans all antipersonnel mines, requires destruction of stockpiled mines within 
four years, requires destruction of mines already in the ground within ten years 
and urges extensive programs to assist the victims of landmines.</font></P>
