        - March 2- </font>The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) Board of Directors announced today 
that it has nominated noted anti-death penalty activist and author Sr. Helen 
Prejean for the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In its nominating letter, the Board cited Sr. Prejean's faith-based advocacy 
in the United States and around the world towards abolition of the death 
penalty. Among her many efforts against capital punishment, Sr. Prejean 
testified in 1998 before the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in favor of 
a resolution calling on Member States to establish a moratorium on executions, 
with a view to completely end the death penalty. The resolution passed the 
Commission, 26 in favor, 13 against and with 12 abstentions.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sr. Prejean is the author of <I>Dead Man Walking</I>, the personal story of 
her efforts on behalf of Louisiana death row inmate Patrick Sonnier. <I>Dead Man 
Walking </I>became a much acclaimed movie in 1996.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Sr. Prejean has for many years been a religious voice of great clarity 
- and challenge -- on the inhumanity of state sponsored executions. She has 
tirelessly worked on behalf of the families of both the victims and perpetrators 
of capital crimes to bring a message of reconciliation, forgiveness and the 
opportunity for redemption,&quot; Newell said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The AFSC shared the 1947 Nobel Peace Prize with the Friends Service Council 
of Great Britain for the humanitarian work of members of the Religious Society 
of Friends (Quakers) in Europe following World Wars I and II. As a Nobel 
laureate, AFSC has the privilege of making nominations to the Nobel Prize 
committee of the government of Norway.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The AFSC views the death penalty as a gross violation of human rights, 
and recognizes that a just and peaceful world can only be built upon a 
foundation in which the human rights of all people are nurtured and 
upheld,&quot; Newell stated.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sr. Prejean is also a critic of the U.S criminal justice system and has 
worked to call attention to bias against the poor and minorities in corrections 
issues. Newell said that Sr. Prejean is at the forefront of efforts to educate 
people in the US about the injustice of the death penalty and to bring 
international pressure to bear upon those who would continue state sanctioned 
executions in our country.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sister Helen Prejean was raised in a devout and privileged Louisiana Catholic 
family and joined the Sisters of St. Joseph of Medaille in 1957. She began 
teaching in suburban parish schools and eventually worked directly with the poor 
in New Orleans where she came to know the impact of poverty, drugs, crime and 
violence. She began the prison ministry that was to change her life in 1981, 
when she began to counsel death row inmates. Her efforts against the death 
penalty have taken her to many locations across the United States and around the 
world.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Sr. Prejean continues to serve as a source of inspiration to the many 
who fervently oppose the death penalty,&quot; Newell said.</font> 
<P align="center">
<font size="2" face="Arial">###</font><P><I><font size="2" face="Arial">The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization which 
includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and 
humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every 
person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and 
injustice.</font></I></P></td>
