        CANADA
        - March 9 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">CARE, the high-profile U.S. 
food aid non-profit, is holding talks today with Monsanto Corporation at the 
company's world headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri (US).</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to 
information received by RAFI, Monsanto's CEO Robert Shapiro contacted CARE's 
President, Peter Bell, inviting CARE officials to discuss ways in which Monsanto 
may be able to use its technologies for the benefit of food security in the 
South. Whether this is an attempt to resurrect Monsanto's scheme to provide 
micro-credit (&quot;soft&quot;) loans to Third World farmers in order to market 
its proprietary pesticides and genetically-modified seeds remains to be seen. </font></p>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial">Monsanto is one 
of the world's leading Gene Giants - dominant in both crop chemicals and seeds. 
The company's best known product, Roundup (glyphosate), is the world's top 
selling herbicide and a multi-billion dollar profit engine for Monsanto. The 
company's patents on Roundup are expiring, however, and Monsanto is looking for 
new ways to maintain its market share and to advance sales of its controversial 
transgenic (genetically-modified) soybean, maize, cotton, and potato varieties. 
Using genetic engineering, Monsanto has bred seeds that tolerate Roundup 
spraying. It is estimated that the contentious market strategy has won Monsanto 
at least 85% of the booming U.S. transgenic seed market, and experts suggest, a 
similar share of the global transgenic market. <BR><BR><B>Cash 'n 
CARE? </B>In June 1998, Monsanto announced that it would develop a 
special microcredit program with the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh that would 
have made it financially feasible for cash-starved farmers to take out loans to 
buy Monsanto's advanced technology products. The Grameen Bank has won 
international accolades for its championing of credit programs to rural women 
who would not normally be seen as credit-worthy by conventional banks. Within a 
month of the Monsanto-Grameen announcement, however, the Bangladeshi institution 
cancelled the deal bowing to intense public pressure within South Asia and 
around the world.<BR><BR><B>Once More with Feeling?</B> 
&quot;At the time, we heard rumors that CARE and possibly some other 
development aid agencies were discussing similar deals with Monsanto,&quot; Pat 
Mooney, RAFI's executive director says, &quot;but we were told that CARE backed 
away from the table when Grameen threw in the towel.&quot; &quot;Now we are 
informed that an international team of CARE officials from their New York 
office, but also from some of their major regional offices, have gone to St. 
Louis to discuss a major initiative with Monsanto,&quot; Mooney adds, &quot;This 
could be a real problem.&quot;<BR><BR><B>GMO's in Every 
Pot?</B> Last year, more than 27.8 million hectares of farmland around 
the world was sown to genetically modified crops. Seventy seven percent of this 
land was sown to transgenic seeds designed to tolerate herbicide spraying. While 
the biggest market for biotech seed is in the USA and Canada, South countries 
such as Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, and China have also adopted the 
controversial seeds. Trials of Monsanto's transgenic seeds in India have led to 
mass demonstrations and intense debate in the media and in government. Similar 
debates are underway in Brazil. In Europe, environmentalists, farmers, and 
consumers have joined together to oppose the use of transgenic seeds. 
<BR><BR><B>GMO's Handled 
by CARE? </B>Blocked in 
Europe, is Monsanto trying to use well-known aid agencies to win acceptance for 
its GMOs among farmers and consumers in the South? &quot;Monsanto officials 
genuinely believe they have products that will solve the problem of food 
shortages in the next century,&quot; Hope Shand of RAFI says. &quot;The company 
may not be acting cynically. They believe they can make money and solve hunger 
through GMOs at the same time,&quot; Shand explains, &quot;If the meeting with 
CARE is to use the food aid agency to test and distribute their 
genetically-altered seeds among poor farmers, both CARE and Monsanto are making 
a terrible mistake.&quot; What exactly the goal is for the St. Louis talks? Are 
they to establish soft loan programs tied to Monsanto products, or to use 
CARE's field offices to facilitate trials of genetically-engineered 
herbicide-tolerant seeds? &quot;Either way,&quot; Pat Mooney concludes, 
&quot;neither party has the credibility to pull this venture off. CARE will be 
lambasted for jeopardizing the food security of farmers and Monsanto will be 
accused of using CARE as 'cheap labor' for its commercial goals. Whatever their 
intent, this indeed will be the result. I've talked with CARE negotiators in New 
York and I'm hopeful that they understand the issues and will not let their good 
name be used to pressure farmers into adopting Monsanto's unsustainable approach 
to agriculture.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>CARE 
Bears?</B> Monsanto is transforming itself from being a traditional 
chemical company into a dominant player in the Life Industry. In recent years, 
Monsanto has spent more than $8.5 billion in acquiring seed companies across the 
world. Many market analysts believe however, that Monsanto has over-extended 
itself and is now weighed under by a huge debt burden. In the midst of the 
world's longest running bull market, Monsanto is on some investor's bear lists. 
Last year, Monsanto announced that it would merge with American Home Products Ð 
another chemicals-turned-biotech corporation more than twice Monsanto's size. 
The deal was eventually called off. Last week, the New York Times reported that 
Monsanto was holding preliminary discussions with DuPont - a vastly larger 
multinational now attempting to extricate itself from energy subsidiaries in 
order to buy into the Life Industry. The message to many investors is that 
Monsanto is a company in trouble and looking for allies. </font>
