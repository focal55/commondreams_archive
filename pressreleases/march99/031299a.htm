        YORK - March 12 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">In a sharp detour from its mission of serving the world's poor, a key UN agency, 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has solicited funds from global 
corporations with tarnished records on human rights, labor and the environment.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">An internal UNDP memo obtained by the Transnational Resource and Action 
Center (the San Francisco-based corporate watchdog that released Ernst &amp; 
Young's audit of a Nike' factory in Vietnam last year) reveals that UNDP has 
approached at least 30 major global corporations and at least eleven are paying 
$50,000 each to UNDP for privileges that flow from this patronage. As part of 
its plan, the UNDP appears to be considering special UNDP sanctioned logos for 
use by corporate sponsors.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Called the &quot;Global Sustainable Development Facility&quot;(GSDF), the 
plan calls for corporate sponsors to funnel donations to a separate entity, 
which they will manage. Sponsors will &quot;benefit from the advice and support 
of UNDP through a special relationship&quot; according to the internal memo. 
Participation in the GSDF will afford corporations unprecedented access to 
UNDP's network of offices, high level governmental contacts and its reputation.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We fear these global corporations care more about
'greenwashing' their 
own tarnished public images than about meeting the pressing needs of the world's 
poor,&quot; said Joshua Karliner, Executive Director of the Transnational 
Resource and Action Center (TRAC). He adds, &quot;The needs of poor communities 
around the world constantly conflict with corporate goals. Corporations often 
use child labor, obstruct trade unions, and engage in practices that destroy 
natural resources and pollute poor communities.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In a letter to UNDP Administrator Gus Speth, copied to UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan, prestigious NGOs from around the world today called on UNDP to 
&quot;halt its Global Sustainable Development Facility project and in so doing 
preserve the credibility of its mission to serve the world's poor.&quot; The 
letter was signed by such prominent international figures as Upendra Baxi, the 
former Vice Chancellor of India's premiere university, the University of Delhi, 
and SM Mohamed Idris, President of the Malaysia-based Third World Network, one 
of the South's most highly respected centers of research and analysis.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The GSDF project reflects a broader trend of growing UN collaboration with 
transnational corporations. Secretary General Kofi Annan has accelerated the 
trend over the past year, notably in a recent speech in Davos, Switzerland. At 
the same time, the UN is considering undercutting a sub-group of the UN Human 
Rights Commission which is addressing the impacts of corporations on a broad 
spectrum of rights issues.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The UN is at a crossroads,&quot; said Upendra
Baxi, a visiting 
professor of law at New York University and former Vice Chancellor of the 
University of Delhi. &quot;It can take the low road and favor trade based, 
market friendly corporate rights or take the high road carved out by its 
founders, which would allow it to continue to stand up for universal labor, 
environmental and human rights in this age of globalization.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The U.S. government's refusal to pay the $1.6 billion it owes the UN 
may be leading the world body to seek political and economic support from 
corporations,&quot; observed John Cavanagh, Director of the Institute for Policy 
Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. &quot;Unfortunately, US policy 
results in pressure on agencies such as UNDP to serve the short term interests 
of corporate shareholders rather than foster the long term goals of sustainable 
human development,&quot; he said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A Perilous Partnership: The United Nations Development Programme's 
Flirtation with Corporate Collaboration,&quot; a report from the Transnational 
Resource and Action Center, the Institute for Policy Studies, and the Council on 
International and Public Affairs, names the corporations that have signed on as 
GSDF sponsors. Many, including the British mining concern Rio Tinto Plc; the 
Swiss-Swedish firm, Asea, Brown Boveri; US corporations Dow Chemical and 
Citibank; and Stat Oil, Norway's state-owned oil company, have come under fire 
from groups around the world for significant human rights, labor or 
environmental abuses.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The UN should be monitoring the human rights and environmental impacts 
of corporations in developing and industrialized nations, not granting special 
favors,&quot; said Ward Morehouse, President of the Council on International and 
Public Affairs. &quot;Increasing collaboration will lead to a reluctance to 
criticize corporations which are central players in the human rights, 
environmental and development dramas unfolding every day across the globe.&quot;</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This is precisely the wrong moment for the UN to do this,&quot; said 
John Cavanagh. &quot;Much of the world is now suffering because there are no 
checks and balances on the global financial market. The United Nations should 
act as a check on global corporations.&quot;</font></P>
