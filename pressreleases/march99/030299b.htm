        - March 2- </font>

        The following was released today by Handgun Control Inc.:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">With the reported ouster of the head of the gun lobby's main
trade 
association, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the gun industry 
appear to be closing ranks in opposition to suits against the industry.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Today's report in the Wall Street Journal that Richard Feldman
is about 
to be dismissed as the executive director of the American Shooting Sports 
Council is yet another indicator of the industry's long-standing 
intransigence. This is an industry that has, and will continue, to resist 
reform to the death. That's why it finds itself in a growing legal 
predicament. Left to its own devices, this industry has, quite simply, 
failed to act responsibly in the design, sale and distribution of its deadly 
product. Now it's paying the price for decades of neglect.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Gun manufacturers believe somehow or other that they are immune
from 
traditional standards of corporate responsibility. And now, following a 
stinging and unexpected defeat at the hands of a Brooklyn jury in the 
Hamilton case, they are closing ranks again with the National Rifle 
Association.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The firing of Feldman shows the transparency of the NRA's
arguments 
against reasonable gun control legislation. When Miami-Dade County filed a 
lawsuit against the gun industry, the NRA responded last week by sending its 
accomplices in the Florida legislature to wield a heavy-handed bill that 
would not only preempt the rights of cities from airing their grievances 
against the gun lobby in court, but would make a felon out of any mayor or county official who filed such a lawsuit. Yet, when Feldman
approached 
the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the city of New Orleans' lawsuit against 
the gun manufacturers, he was shown the door by the NRA.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Litigation is too expensive, they say, but settlement is out of
the 
question. Their only remaining tactic's intimidation. This is the kind of 
political bullying that the gun lobby is so famous for, and we can expect to 
see a lot more of it the weeks and monthsahead.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Rather than mounting the political barricades, the industry
should be 
talking to us about how to make guns safer, and how to keep them out of the 
hands of children and criminals. Dennis Henigan, director of the Legal 
Action Project of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, who is 
representing three of the cities who have sued the gun industry said, 
&quot;We're not trying to bring the gun manufacturers to their knees, we are 
trying to bring them to their senses.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The NRA and the industry are joined at the hip in a desperate
struggle. 
In the words of one gun industry executive, this is going to be a 
&quot;fight to the death.&quot; But now the NRA and gun manufacturers have 
started to swing blindly -- and reason is taking the first hit.</font> 
<P align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">------</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control Inc., chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's
largest 
citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI 
works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun control laws, but does 
not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members 
nationwide and works with local groups around the country to enact and 
protect reasonable gun control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence,
