        - March 12 - </font>Conservative think tanks are likely to increase their strength and impact in 
the new millennium with their unflagging commitment to marketing their policies, sophisticated political communication, seemingly unlimited
        resources and strong grassroots networks, according to a recent study by 
the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP), titled &quot;$1 
Billion for Ideas: Conservative Think Tanks in the 1990s.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;$1 Billion for Ideas&quot; builds on two earlier NCRP research reports
that examined the burgeoning of state-level conservative think tanks (1991) and private foundations funding the conservative political
renaissance (1997). This report, authored by David Callahan, picks up the threads of these earlier analyses to provide an expanded and more
detailed analysis of 20 leading conservative think tanks.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">NCRP President Robert Bothwell commented, &quot;When it comes to
'winning' political battles, ultimate success results less from who's doing the right thing and more from whose view of reality dominates
the 
battlefield. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the 
millions effectively spent by conservative think tanks have enabled them 
virtually to dictate the issues and terms of national political 
debates.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The top 20 conservative think tanks in the United States spent
$158 
million in 1996 and, as &quot;$1 Billion for Ideas&quot; asserts, spending will likely exceed $1 billion between 1990 and 2000. The 20 policy
institutions included in the study more than doubled their budgets since 
1992.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;To put the $158 million spent by the groups in perspective, the
Republican Party raised and spent $138 million in 'soft money' contributions in 1996, $20 million less than the conservative policy
groups profiled in the report,&quot; said Callahan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The NCRP's analysis includes well-known conservative think tanks
such as 
the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise 
Institute, but also many of the smaller, less visible conservative think 
tanks that have been multiplying and expanding throughout the 1990s. 
Together, these and other conservative policy groups have been able to 
define policy issues and approaches for public attention, skillfully using 
mainstream and alternative media outlets to create a powerful echo effect in 
and beyond the nation's capital.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">NCRP found several factors contributing to the success of
conservative 
policy groups in the 1990s and their likely expanding influence in the new 
millennium:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Conservative think tanks were able to use their spending power
to 
build impressive institutions and infrastructures. Partial data from 1997 
indicate that spending by center-right and far-right think tanks continues 
to grow rapidly, suggesting that the 1990s has been a period of continued 
institution-building by political conservatives. Overall spending by these 
institutions between 1990 and 2000 is likely to top $1 billion.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- A number of smaller and relatively new conservative think tanks
have 
risen to new positions of visibility in recent years. The five largest and 
most well-known policy institutions (the Heritage Foundation, Hoover 
Institution, Center for Strategic and International Studies, American 
Enterprise Institute, and Free Congress Research and Education Foundation) 
expended half of the $158 million total in 1996, but the remaining $80 
million was spent by 15 smaller policy organizations working to advance core 
elements of the conservative agenda.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- The groups continue to promote a highly ideological view
through 
multi-policy fronts arguing for privatization of the public sphere and 
elevation of the market as the prime mechanisms for social arbitration and 
resource allocation.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Conservative think tanks increasingly attract contributions
from 
corporations interested in affecting the political process.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Conservative policy groups have shown increasing sophistication
in 
waging high-intensity battles over extended periods of time, better 
coordinating their activities with lobbyists in the private sector, 
political operatives in Washington and the states, and activists at the 
grassroots. Major battles in the 1990s have helped them to refine their 
advocacy machines. At this point, these groups operate like &quot;extra 
party&quot; organizations, adopting the tactics of a permanent political 
campaign.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- The structure of political opportunities in the U.S. continues
to 
advantage conservative policy groups. The disconnect between people and 
politics and the growing imbalance between private power and public purpose 
has provided the perfect breeding ground for conservative success. 
Contributing factors include the continued demobilization of the American 
electorate, the decisive role that special interest money plays in national 
politics, the media's political importance, organized labor's declining 
ability to help set broad national budget and policy priorities, the 
single-issue focus on many left institutions, and the left's failure to 
develop and communicate to the American electorate an overarching public philosophy for the country.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- The absence of a mainstream or left-of-center parallel to the
critical 
mass of conservative policy institutions currently operating in the U.S. 
today has allowed conservative policy entrepreneurs formidable power to 
define, direct and dominate policy and ideological debates.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Overall, &quot;$1 Billion for Ideas&quot; argues that the rising strength of
conservative policy institutions is likely to reinforce trends toward a 
greatly narrowed public policy debate in the U.S. Rising national wealth and 
economic inequality, growing public disengagement from politics, and 
enduring racial problems continue to plague the nation, and there are no 
major initiatives on the horizon that would improve life for all. 
Unfortunately, as the conservative story becomes ever more influential, the 
search for substantive solutions creating shared prosperity, a stronger 
democracy and a more equal society sink even lower as priorities on the 
national agenda. <BR>------ <BR>NCRP was founded in 1976 as a watchdog 
organization with a mission to make philanthropic institutions more 
accountable and accessible to the disadvantaged. Copies of the 42-page 
report, &quot;$1 Billion for Ideas: Conservative Think Tanks in the 
1990s,&quot; are available at $25 per copy, prepaid. Copies of the 1997 
report, &quot;Moving a Public Policy: The Strategic Philanthropy of 
Conservative Foundations,&quot; are also available ($25).</font>
