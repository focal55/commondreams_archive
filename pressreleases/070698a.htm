    (NEA) Representative Assembly today set the association's course for continued cooperation
    and collaboration with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), proclaiming their
    commitment to pursuing unity.<br>
    <br>
    After a vigorous three-hour debate by almost 10,000 delegates, NEA members voted
    overwhelmingly to move ahead toward uniting the two organizations to better serve children
    and education.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Today, delegates have charted a clear direction,&quot; said NEA President Bob Chase.
    &quot;The dream of uniting America's educators in a single organization is very much
    alive. NEA delegates will leave this Representative Assembly with a single voice, and that
    is a strong voice for unity. The NEA family is fully committed to reaching that shared
    goal.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Overwhelming adoption of a New Business Item (NBI) directed the Association to continue
    the NEA/AFT Joint Council's efforts to enhance teacher quality, improve school safety and
    discipline, and modernize America's school building. The measure also established a
    procedure to set guidelines under which state affiliates could unite.<br>
    <br>
    Several states -- Montana, Florida, New Mexico and Minnesota -- are at various stages in
    developing unification agreements. As part of the action, delegates voted to encourage the
    NEA and AFT to continue their &quot;no-raid&quot; agreement, which discourages
    representational battles between local affiliates of both organizations.<br>
    <br>
    The action today affirms the Representative Assembly's commitment to the concept of a
    single, national organization that represents teachers and other education employees. The
    previous day, the delegates had voted down the Principles of Unity, which proposed a
    method to merge the two organizations.<br>
    ------<br>
    The National Education Association is the nation's largest professional employee
    organization, representing more than 2.4 million elementary and secondary teachers, higher
    education faculty, education support personnel, school administrators, retired educators,
    and students preparing to become teachers.<br>
    --<br>
    Note: Text of the New Business Item follows.<br>
    --<br>
    NEW BUSINESS ITEM # 1 AS ADOPTED<br>
    The Representative Assembly affirms its historic commitment to the concept of unity with
    the AFT. Consistent with this commitment, the Representative Assembly directs the
    President, in consultation with the Executive Committee and a representative group of
    leaders from large and small state affiliates and state affiliates that supported and
    opposed the Principles of Unity, to analyze the results of the Representative Assembly
    debate on the Principles, and determine the appropriate steps to take in order to achieve
    unity with the AFT, including when and under what circumstances to resume unity
    discussions with the AFT.<br>
    <br>
    As part of this analysis, a written survey of the delegates to the 1998 Representative
    Assembly will be conducted to identify those aspects of the Principles of Unity which were
    unacceptable to some delegates including, but not limited to, secret ballot, minority
    guarantees, AFL-CIO affiliation, one person-one vote, governance structures, and term
    limits. If unity discussions with the AFT are resumed, the NEA negotiating team will be
    guided by the results of this survey. The NEA negotiating team will, in addition, consult
    on a regular basis with a negotiations advisory committee consisting of, among others, a
    representative group of leaders from large and small state affiliates and state affiliates
    that supported and opposed the Principles of Unity.<br>
    <br>
    The Executive Committee will keep the Board of Directors and state affiliates informed of
    developments, provided that no commitments regarding a merger between NEA and AFT will be
    made without the approval of the Representative Assembly by a 2/3 majority vote in a
    secret ballot election.<br>
    <br>
    The President and Executive Committee will develop guidelines to deal with the question of
    mergers between NEA and AFT state affiliates before an NEA/AFT merger takes place, and
    arrange for the introduction of any amendments to the NEA Constitution and Bylaws that may
    be necessary. These guidelines will be approved by the Board of Directors before they are
    implemented, and any proposed amendments to the Constitution and Bylaws will be approved
    by the Board of Directors before they are introduced. No state affiliate mergers will take
    place except in accordance with these guidelines.<br>
    <br>
    While these actions are taking place, the NEA shall propose to the AFT continuation of the
    AFT/NEA Joint Council and the AFT/NEA national no-raid agreement, including the provisions
    of the agreement dealing with non-bargaining states.<br>
    <br>
    This NBI supersedes NBI 1995-A, but does not supersede or waive any provision of the NEA
    Constitution and Bylaws, or any other policy of NEA.<p align="center">-0-</td>
