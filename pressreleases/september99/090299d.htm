<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- September 2 - As global population rushes toward 6 billion--and beyond--national 
governments face the daunting task of creating nearly 30 million additional jobs 
each year for the next fifty years. Although Americans will celebrate Labor Day 
on Monday, September 6 with unemployment at a near record low, unemployment in 
the rest of the world is at an all-time high. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Failure to absorb the record 
number of new job seekers could fuel political instability as rising numbers of 
jobless youth strain the social fabric. In the absence of an accelerated effort 
to slow population growth in the years ahead, unemployment could soar to unmanageable 
levels. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since mid-century, the 
world's labor force--those between the ages of 15 and 65 seeking work--has expanded 
from 1.2 billion people in 1950 to nearly 3 billion in 1999. Over the same period, 
the world's total population surged from 2.5 to 6 billion. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unfortunately, the number 
of new jobs has not kept pace with the increasing number of job seekers. The United 
Nations International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that over 1 billion people, 
about one third of the global work force, are unemployed or underemployed (involuntarily 
working substantially less than full time, or earning less than a living wage). 
Persistent high levels of unemployment in many European nations with stable populations 
indicate the policy challenges of providing jobs even without rapid population 
growth. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If population increases 
remain on the current trajectory, the global work force will swell from 3 billion 
to nearly 4.5 billion by 2050. Of these 1.5 billion new job seekers, almost all 
will live in developing nations, where rapid population growth translates into 
intense pressure on job markets. Already struggling to satisfy basic needs, such 
as access to clean water and sanitation, many of these countries will be hard-pressed 
to create the required jobs. In the world's 50 poorest nations, the work force 
will surge some 235 percent by 2050. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The interaction between 
population growth and jobs is most acute in nations with young populations. Peru, 
Mexico, Indonesia, Zambia, and other nations with more than half of their population 
below the age of 25 will feel the burden of this labor flood. In the Middle East 
and Africa, 40 percent of the population is under the age of 15. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nations are straining to 
educate and train rapidly growing numbers of young people in marketable skills 
for the global workplace. But even so, many young people are facing dismal job 
prospects. Worldwide, the ILO estimates that currently there are 60 million people 
between the ages of 15 and 24 who are in search of work but cannot find it. And 
in most societies, unemployment for those under 25 is substantially higher than 
for older people. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nowhere is the employment 
challenge greater than in Africa, where 40 percent of the population lives in 
absolute poverty and where underemployment is already the norm. Although 9 million 
people entered the sub-Saharan work force in 1999, in just two decades this resource-scarce 
region will have to absorb more than 16 million new entrants each year. Over the 
next half-century, Nigeria's labor force is projected to nearly triple, and Ethiopia's 
to nearly quadruple. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As a result of unprecedented 
population growth and increasing acceptance of female participation in the work 
force, the number of people seeking work in the Middle East and North Africa, 
a region plagued by double-digit unemployment rates, will double in the next 50 
years. Rising numbers of jobless young people will add to existing political tensions 
in the region. In Algeria, a rapidly growing country already wrapped in turmoil, 
22 percent of the work force is unemployed. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Asia will also see phenomenal 
increases in the numbers seeking work. For example, Pakistan's work force is projected 
to grow from 72 million in 1999 to 199 million by 2050. Over the next 25 years, 
India will add nearly 10 million to its work force each year--a cumulative addition 
nearly as great as the current US population. Having slowed its population growth 
dramatically, larger China is adding only 6 million workers annually. Even so, 
the rush of migrants to China's coastal cities and massive layoffs from state-run 
operations are compounding work shortages. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The population seeking 
work in the industrial world will actually decline slightly over the coming decades, 
as couples are choosing to have smaller families and as the population ages. However, 
in the United States, one of the few industrial nations where population continues 
to swell, the work force will grow from 139 million in 1999 to 162 million in 
2050, adding roughly half a million job seekers each year. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In a situation of labor 
surplus, the quality of jobs may suffer, for workers will settle for lower wages, 
longer hours, fewer benefits, and less control over work activities. As global 
economic integration proceeds, surplus labor anywhere can weaken labor's bargaining 
power everywhere. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Rapid technological developments 
and globalization have also decreased demand for some kinds of labor. The increasing 
mechanization of agriculture has reduced labor needs on the farm--where most of 
the world still derives its food and income--while the flood of cheap food imports 
as economies liberalize can undermine rural livelihoods altogether. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Historically, surplus farmland 
served as a source of employment for growing populations, as new land could be 
brought under the plow to generate work, income, and sustenance. However, with 
the frontiers of agricultural expansion largely gone by 1950, global cropland 
per person has dropped by half since then. Moreover, the global exodus of job 
seekers from the countryside fuels the already high unemployment in many cities. 
Creating jobs in an urban world will require massive investment to accelerate 
employment growth in the industrial and service sectors. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In many regions, recent 
employment creation has come at the expense of job quality. Some 80 to 90 percent 
of new jobs in Latin America are in the informal sector--the underbelly of the 
economy characterized by low wages, poor working conditions, and little job security. 
The informal sector also accounts for 60 percent of employment in urban Africa. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As capital becomes increasingly 
mobile, corporations are shifting new investments to developing countries with 
their large pool of low cost labor. Viewed as a threat to workers in the industrial 
world, this shifting capital has helped create jobs in developing countries. China 
has been among the most successful nations in attracting such foreign capital. 
A combination of high domestic savings, record inflows of investment capital, 
and slow population growth created a record number of jobs and boosted incomes 
four-fold from 1980 to 1998. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Employment is the key to 
obtaining food, housing, health services, and education, in addition to providing 
self-respect and self-fulfillment. But in scores of countries rapid population 
growth is bringing greater unemployment, more people living in poverty, and more 
political instability. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Traditionally, governments 
have relied on economic policy to create jobs, but now those facing continued 
rapid population growth will need to rely on population policy as well. Achieving 
full employment is inseparably linked to efforts to stabilize population. Enhanced 
domestic and international support for family planning services, reproductive 
health care, the education of young women and men, and other efforts to stabilize 
population will yield the dual benefits of better living conditions and brighter 
job prospects in the next century. </font>
