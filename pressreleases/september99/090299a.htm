- September 2 - In the midst of the best economy in 30 years, health care costs 
remain a significant financial burden for many low- and middle-income families. 
A large proportion of Americans earning under the median family income of $35,000 
are uninsured, go without needed care, face collection agencies when they cannot 
pay their medical bills, and report poor health, according to <I><a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/programs/insurance/budetti_sick_347.asp">Can’t 
Afford to Get Sick: A Reality for Millions of Working Americans</a></I>, a new 
report based on <I>The Commonwealth Fund 1999 National Survey of Workers’ Health 
Insurance</I>. Authors John Budetti, Lisa Duchon, Cathy Schoen, and Janet Shikles 
find that a surprising number of middle- and higher-income Americans also have 
difficulties getting needed medical care and paying medical bills. The report 
is based on findings from the Fund’s survey of 5,002 Americans ages 18 to 64, 
which was conducted from January through May 1999 by Princeton Survey Research 
Associates </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Many Working Americans 
Are Shut Out of the Health Care System</B><br>
Lack of insurance remains a significant and growing problem, especially for those 
living in the bottom half of the income distribution. While nearly one of five 
(19%) working-age adults lacked health insurance, almost one of three (32%) adults 
with incomes below $35,000 were uninsured. Two of five (41%) adults with incomes 
in the bottom fourth (earning less than $20,000 annually) lacked health insurance. 
In contrast, just 7 percent of working-age adults with incomes $35,000 and above 
were uninsured. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many working Americans with 
below-average incomes do not have the option of obtaining coverage from their 
jobs, a problem that is particularly acute for low-wage workers. Two of five (42%) 
workers with incomes less than $20,000 either were not offered a plan through 
their workplace (25%) or were not eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored 
plan (17%). </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Uninsured workers rarely 
had the option of employer-based coverage. Only 16 percent of those working but 
uninsured were eligible for an employer plan, and many worked for employers who 
did not offer health benefits. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hispanics were generally 
at high risk of being uninsured and lacking access to employer plans. Nearly two 
of five Hispanics were uninsured. Among those who were working, one of three (34%) 
did not have a health plan available through their job, compared with 18 percent 
of whites and 17 percent of blacks. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have to recognize 
that our system of providing health insurance often does not work well for millions 
of working Americans,&quot; said Karen Davis, president of The Commonwealth Fund. 
&quot;As we look forward to the 21st century, we need to look for solutions that 
could enhance opportunities for working men and women to lead healthy, productive 
lives.&quot; </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Health Care Financial 
Burdens Affect Health and Economic Security</B><br>
High health care costs have consequences for people of all incomes. One of four 
(24%) adults—an estimated 40 million working-age Americans—either did not fill 
a prescription, failed to get a recommended test or treatment, or failed to see 
a doctor when needed because they could not afford it. More than one of three 
living below the median U.S. income, and nearly half (45%) of those in the bottom 
fourth of the income range, went without needed medical care in the previous year. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economic security, already 
tenuous for many Americans, is further threatened by health care costs. One of 
three (33 percent) working-age adults, representing 54 million Americans, described 
their financial situation as having &quot;just enough&quot; or &quot;not enough&quot; 
money to meet basic living expenses. Medical bills add a significant economic 
burden: more than half (51%) of those with incomes less than $20,000 and three 
of 10 (30%) adults with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 did not have enough 
money to pay their medical bills in the past year. An estimated 31 million people—or 
nearly one of five (19%) working-age adults—were contacted by a collection agency 
for unpaid medical bills in the past year, including one of three (34%) of those 
with incomes less than $20,000. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A surprising number of people 
with higher incomes faced medical bill problems as well. One of four with incomes 
between $20,000 and $35,000 were contacted by collection agencies for unpaid medical 
bills, as were 14 percent of those with incomes between $35,000 and $60,000. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Task Force Formed to 
Search for Innovative Solutions</B><br>
To address these and other issues, The Commonwealth Fund has created the Task 
Force on the Future of Health Insurance for Working Americans. The nonpartisan 
expert panel will comprise individuals nationally recognized for their contributions 
in the fields of business, government, public policy, economics, and medicine. 
&quot;The Task Force will work to put the debate over expanding health insurance 
coverage back on the national policy agenda,&quot; said chair James J. Mongan, 
M.D., president and CEO of Massachusetts General Hospital. &quot;We hope to support 
work that will enable the nation to make progress toward reducing the number of 
uninsured Americans and improving the stability and quality of health insurance 
for working families.&quot; </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Task Force will carry 
out and support cutting-edge research to redesign coverage to fit a 21st century 
labor force. Its initial project will be to develop workable solutions to the 
problem of working Americans who lack health insurance, and to provide constructive 
analyses on a wide range of options that have the potential for broad-based support.<br>
