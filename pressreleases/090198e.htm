    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - September 1 - Going For Broke, a study released today by
    Common Cause, reveals that the consumer credit industry has given $61.6 million in
    political contributions since 1987. The study comes as the United States Senate is poised
    to act - perhaps as early as this week - on sweeping, creditor-backed bankruptcy reform
    legislation despite criticism from consumer advocates and some bankruptcy experts. <p>The
    consumer credit industry - banks, credit card companies, consumer finance companies,
    savings and loans, and credit unions - have given $50.8 million in political action
    committee (PAC) contributions to congressional candidates, and $10.8 million in soft money
    contributions to national party committees, according to the study. </p>
    <p>&quot;Congress has a legitimate interest in making changes in the bankruptcy law to
    avoid abuses of the law by wealthy individuals who want to shirk their debt,&quot; Common
    Cause President Ann McBride said. &quot;But that congressional review has been distorted
    by millions of dollars of campaign contributions. In fact, while Congress is rushing to
    pass new bankruptcy legislation, it is ignoring warnings of experts and consumer activists
    who argue that ordinary Americans are not being adequately considered in this
    creditor-driven push for sweeping legislation.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Common Cause study found that since 1987, the consumer credit industry has given,
    on average, $100,000 in PAC contributions to current Members of the Senate, and $47,724 to
    current Members of the House. Of all current House and Senate Members, 97 percent took PAC
    contributions from banking and consumer credit interests during the period covered by the
    study. </p>
    <p>Included in the study is a Member-by-Member breakdown of the consumer credit industry's
    PAC contributions, as well as a list of the largest contributors within the industry, and
    lists of the top recipients in the House and Senate. </p>
