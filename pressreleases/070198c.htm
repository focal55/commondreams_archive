    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 1 - The U.S. Committee for Refugees and World Vision
    today called for an immediate moratorium on all bombing in Southern Sudan.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The aerial bombings in the region are inhibiting the humanitarian response, thus
    limiting food and humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians who are traumatized by
    sporadic violence, exacerbating the famine conditions,&quot; said Roger Winter, executive
    director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees.<br>
    <br>
    The situation in Southern Sudan is rapidly deteriorating, according to Winter. The World
    Food Program estimates that 2.6 million Southern Sudanese are at risk of dying from
    famine.<br>
    This estimate has risen from 350,000 just two months ago.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The World Food Program needs between nine and ten thousand metric tons of food per
    month in order to meet the needs in the South,&quot; said Kate Almquist, policy advisor
    for World Vision. &quot;Currently, they are only able to provide about five thousand
    metric tons per month. We need more flights, bringing more food, or else thousands of
    people will die in a matter of weeks. Time is running out.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    While noting the ongoing U.S. assistance to the region, the NGOs today called on the U.S.
    government to make sure all World Food Program appeals for assistance are fully met by the
    U.S. and other donor governments.<br>
    <br>
    Winter and Almquist returned last week from a four-day visit to the Bar El Ghazal region
    of Southern Sudan. &quot;The situation in Sudan today is much worse than anyone
    imagined,&quot; Almquist stated. Winter added, &quot;In my nearly 18 years of experience
    in the Sudan, I have never seen famine conditions as bad as those I saw last week.&quot;<p align="center">------</p>
