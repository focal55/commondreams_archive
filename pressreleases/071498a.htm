    delegates of the National Organization for Women gather in convention on the one hundred
    and fiftieth year of the women's rights movement. <br>
    <br>
    We bring passion, anger, hope, love and perseverance to create this vision for the future:
    &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where women's equality and women's empowerment to determine our own
    destiny is a reality; <br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where women have equal representation in all decision-making
    structures of our societies; <br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where social and economic justice exist, where all people have the
    food, housing, clothing, health care, and education they need;<br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where there is recognition and respect for each person's intrinsic
    worth as well as the rich diversity of the various groups among us.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where non-violence is the established order; <br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where patriarchal culture and male dominance no longer oppress us or
    our Earth; <br>
    <br>
    We envision a world where women and girls are heard, valued and respected. <br>
    <br>
    Ours is a movement that directs our love for humanity into action that spans the world and
    unites women.&nbsp; It is a movement that is both multi-issue and multi-strategic.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    But our future requires us to know our past.<br>
    <br>
    One hundred fifty years ago the women's rights movement grew out of the fight to abolish
    slavery.&nbsp; Angered by their exclusion from leadership and public speaking at
    abolitionist conventions and inspired by the power of the Iroquois women, a small
    dedicated group of women and men built a movement.&nbsp; After its inception, the movement
    was fractured by race.&nbsp; Our history is full of struggle against common bonds of
    oppression and a painful reality of separation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these activists
    created a political force that achieved revolutionary change.&nbsp; They won property
    rights for married women; opened the doors of higher education for women; and garnered the
    vote for women in 1920.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In 1923, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the historic Seneca Falls convention, Alice
    Paul led the demand for constitutional equality for women to win full justice under the
    law in order to end economic, educational, and political inequality.<br>
    <br>
    Our foremothers&nbsp; the first wave of feminists&nbsp; ran underground railroads,
    lobbied, marched, and picketed.&nbsp; They were jailed and force fed, lynched and raped.
    &nbsp; But they prevailed.&nbsp; They started with a handful of activists, and today, the
    feminist movement involves millions of people every day.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Standing on their shoulders, we launched the National Organization for Women in 1966, the
    largest and strongest organization of feminist activists in the world today.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
    devoutly grassroots, action-oriented organization, we&nbsp; have sued, boycotted,
    picketed, lobbied, demonstrated, marched, and engaged in non-violent civil disobedience.
    &nbsp; We have won in the courts and in the legislatures; and we have negotiated with the
    largest corporations in the world, winning unparalleled rights for women.<br>
    <br>
    The National Organization for Women and our modern day movement have profoundly changed
    the lives of women, men and children.&nbsp; We have raised public consciousness about the
    plight of women to such an extent that the majority of people today support equality for
    women.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In the past 32 years, women have advanced farther than in any previous generation.
    &nbsp; Yet still we do not have full equality.<br>
    <br>
    We have moved more feminists than ever before into positions of power in all of the
    institutions that shape our society.&nbsp; We have achieved some measure of power to
    effect change in these institutions from within; yet still we are far from full equality
    in decision-making.&nbsp; We demand an equal share of power in our families and religions;
    in law, medicine, the arts and humanities, sports, education, the trades and professions,
    labor and management, the media, corporations and small businesses as well as government.
    &nbsp; In no sphere of life should women be silenced, underrepresented, or devalued.
    &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Today, we reaffirm our demand for Constitutional equality for women and girls.
    &nbsp; Simultaneously, we are working with sister organizations to develop and pass a
    national women's equality act for the twenty-first century.&nbsp; And we participate in
    and advance a global movement for women and demand that the United States join the
    overwhelming majority of nations of the world in ratifying the United Nations Convention
    on the Elimination of All Forms of<br>
    Discrimination Against Women without reservations, declarations, or understandings that
    would weaken this commitment.<br>
    <br>
    We reaffirm our commitment to the power of grassroots activism, to a multi-issue,
    multi-tactical strategy.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    We are committed to a feminist ideology and reaffirm our historic commitment to gaining
    equality for women, assuring safe, legal and accessible abortion and full reproductive
    freedom, combating racism, stopping violence against women, ending bigotry based on sexual
    orientation, and ending discrimination based on color, ethnicity, national origin, age,
    disability, size, childbearing capacity or choices, or parental or marital status.<br>
    <br>
    We will not trade off the rights of one woman for the advancement of another.&nbsp; We
    will not be divided.&nbsp; We will unite with all women who seek freedom and join hands
    with all of the great movements of our time and all time, seeking equality, empowerment
    and justice.<br>
    <br>
    We commit to continuing the mentoring, training, and leadership development of young and
    new activists of all ages who will continue our struggle.&nbsp; We will work to invoke
    enthusiasm for our goals and to expand ownership in this movement for current and future
    generations.<br>
    <br>
    We commit to building a mass movement where we are leaders, not followers, of public
    opinion.&nbsp; We will continue to move feminist ideals into the mainstream thought, and
    we will build our&nbsp; media and new technology capabilities to control our own image and
    message.<br>
    <br>
    How long and hard a struggle it was to win the right for women to vote. Today, we fight
    the same reactionary forces: the perversion of religion to subjugate women; corporate
    greed that seeks to exploit women and children as a cheap labor force; and their
    apologists in public office who seek to do through law what terrorists seek to accomplish
    through bullets and bombs.&nbsp; We will not submit graciously, nor will we be
    intimidated.&nbsp; But we will keep moving forward.<br>
    <br>
    Those who carried the struggle for women's suffrage through to its end were not there at
    the start; those who started the struggle did not live to see the victory.&nbsp; Like
    those strong feminist activists, we will not let ourselves be dispirited or discouraged.
    Even when progress seems most illusive, we will maintain our conviction that the work
    itself is important.&nbsp; For it is the work that enriches our lives; it is the work that
    unites us; it is the work that will propel us into the next century.&nbsp; We know that
    our struggle has made a difference, and we reaffirm our faith that it will continue to
    make a difference for women's lives.<br>
    <br>
    Today, we dedicate ourselves to the sheer joy of moving forward and fighting back. <p align="center">###<br>
