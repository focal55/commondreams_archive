    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 7 - In the latest of series of legislative attacks
    against gay Americans and people at risk for HIV, two amendments to the District of
    Columbia House Appropriations Bill were passed that would prohibit unmarried couples from
    jointly adopting and deny money for needle exchange programs. The discriminatory adoption
    amendment, offered by Oklahoma Republican Steve Largent, is unmistakably anti-gay and is
    an intrusion into local government that will put thousands of DC children at risk,
    according to the Human Rights Campaign.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The contradictions and illogic of Largent's
    anti-gay amendment are unbelievable.&nbsp; On the one hand, those pushing it say they want
    to provide greater security for children.&nbsp; But in reality, they are creating less
    stability by limiting the number of guardians which will leave children vulnerable,&quot;
    said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.&nbsp; &quot;The American public doesn't
    want family policy made by the federal government.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hypocritical that
    these vocal proponents of more local control want to play national nanny and micro-manage
    adoption decisions that should be made on a case-by-case basis by parents and
    professionals.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Largent amendment, which passed on a
    227-192 vote,&nbsp; single DC residents would still have the ability to adopt children.
    &nbsp; The amendment will ban joint adoption by unrelated persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; While both
    parties of an unmarried couple would obviously still serve as parents to the child, the
    second parent would have no legal responsibility or protections for the child, including
    financial. In unfortunate circumstances, such as a break up or the death of a legal
    parent,&nbsp; the non-legal parent would have no legal responsibility to care for the
    child.&nbsp; As of June 22, 1998, there were 3,600 children in the D.C. foster care system
    waiting to be adopted.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passage of Rep. Largent's amendment follows
    last week's rejection of the same amendment offered by Rep. Tiahrt to the House
    Appropriations Committee.&nbsp; For three years, there have been attempts to attach
    similar language on adoption in the D.C. appropriations bill. This is the first time such
    language has passed.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An August, 1997 poll conducted by Penn,
    Schoen &amp; Berland Associates shows that most Americans agree that the federal
    government should stay out of family law decisions.&nbsp; In fact, Americans categorically
    reject the notion that the government should take a greater role in deciding who can and
    cannot adopt children.&nbsp; By a margin of nearly four to one (74 to 19 percent,) voters
    say we should keep the system we currently have, rather than allow the federal government
    to take a greater role. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kansas Republican Rep. Tiahrt's amendment to
    the bill also passed by a vote of 250-169.&nbsp; The Tiahrt amendment would prohibit the
    use of federal and District funds from being used for needle exchange programs.&nbsp; The
    amendment further prohibits funds from being paid to any organization that carries out
    such programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This crass political opportunism and
    intrusion into local District affairs will result in more people suffering and becoming
    infected with HIV,&quot; said HRC senior health policy advocate Seth Kilbourn.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tiahrt amendment is a radical departure
    from previous Congressional action on this issue and sets a dangerous precedent for many
    states and localities where needle exchange programs operate using local and state funds. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The District of Columbia has chosen to
    use its own funds to address an urgent local need.&nbsp; Congress should not encroach on
    the ability of any state or locality to implement successful programs to prevent the
    transmission of HIV.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We will work tirelessly during the months
    ahead to defeat both of these amendments in conference,&quot; said Stachelberg.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the largest
    national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country. It
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community.<p align="center">- 30 -<br>
