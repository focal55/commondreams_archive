    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 6 - Four million low-income seniors and people with
    disabilities, who are entitled to have their Medicare premiums paid for by programs
    established by Congress, are not receiving such help and, instead, are having their Social
    Security checks slashed each month to pay for those premiums. That is the charge leveled
    today in a report issued by the health consumer watchdog organization, Families USA.<br>
    <br>
    Shortchanged: Billions Withheld From Medicare Beneficiaries found that the Social Security
    Administration is withholding approximately $2 billion in annual premiums from Medicare
    beneficiaries who should have their premiums subsidized through Congressionally enacted
    programs. For low-income persons living alone, mainly widows and widowers, the amount
    being lost equals $525.60 per year. For couples, the loss is $1,051.20. <br>
    <br>
    Close to half the people entitled to have their Medicare premiums paid for are not
    receiving such assistance, according to the Families USA analysis. The report indicates
    that many low-income seniors and people with disabilities are also entitled to have their
    Medicare deductibles and co-payments subsidized but are not receiving this help.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As Medicare costs continue to grow, low-income seniors and disabled persons continue
    to see their Social Security checks shrink,&quot; said Ron Pollack, executive director of
    Families USA. &quot;If the Social Security Administration is responsible for cutting the
    checks of these needy seniors each month, it should also be responsible for getting them
    the benefits Congress and the President established and that they desperately need. &quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    The following states have the highest numbers of low-income seniors and disabled
    individuals eligible for payment of their Medicare premiums but are not receiving them:
    Texas (370,000 to 404,000); Florida (252,000 to 275,000); Ohio (233,000 to 264,000);
    Pennsylvania (202,000 to 231,000); Illinois (198,000 to 226,000); New York (148,000 to
    192,000); Virginia (122,000 to 131,000); Michigan (103,000 to 118,000); Massachusetts
    (94,000 to 113,000); Washington (99,000 to 107,000); Alabama (92,000 to 100,000); and
    Georgia (88,000 to 103,000). [Please see the report for more information.]<br>
    <br>
    During the last decade Congress established a number of programs, known as the
    &quot;Medicare buy-in,&quot; to help this needy population:<br>
    <br>
    The Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program, enacted in 1988, is designed to pay the
    Medicare premiums, deductibles, and co-payments for seniors and disabled persons whose
    incomes are below the poverty line - $8,292 in annual income for people living alone and
    $11,100 for couples. The report finds that between 1.9 and 2.4 million of these people,
    the poorest seniors and people with disabilities in the country, are not getting the
    benefits they are entitled to receive.<br>
    <br>
    The Specified Low-income Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMB) program, established in 1990, pays
    for Medicare premiums for seniors and disabled persons with incomes between the poverty
    line and 20 percent above that line. The report finds that approximately 1.4 million
    people eligible for SLMB benefits are not getting them.<br>
    <br>
    For people with incomes up to 35 percent above the poverty line, a program was established
    in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to expand Medicare premium subsidization. The report
    finds that as of June 1998, of the approximately 499,000 people funded by Congress to get
    this aid, only 4,723 individuals - less than one percent - are receiving it.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Since Medicare premiums will more than double over the next decade,&quot; Pollack
    said, &quot;the withholding of these benefits will result in lower and lower Social
    Security checks. Unless the problems with enrollment in the Medicare buy-in programs are
    resolved, the federal government will take an even larger bite out of the meager Social
    Security checks of widows and widowers in years to come.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    According to the Congressional Budget Office, Medicare premiums will increase from $525.60
    per year to $1,268.40 in the year 2008.<br>
    <br>
    Families USA cites lack of knowledge about the buy-in programs as the major reason for low
    participation. Although Medicare beneficiaries must visit a Social Security office to
    enroll in Medicare, and although the Social Security Administration deducts Medicare
    premiums from Social Security checks, low-income seniors and disabled persons are not
    allowed to apply for the buy-in programs at that office. Instead, people are required to
    apply at state welfare and Medicaid offices. In addition, there are many bureaucratic
    hurdles that must be overcome to apply for buy-in benefits, including extensive
    documentation and, in some states, requirements of in-person applications.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are some very simple steps that can be taken to ensure that more low-income
    seniors and people with disabilities don't lose out on these important benefits,&quot;
    added Pollack. &quot;First and foremost, the Social Security Administration should
    directly enroll low-income Medicare beneficiaries in the buy-in programs at Social
    Security offices.&quot;<p align="center">###</p>

    Medicare beneficiaries who believe they may be eligible for QMB or SLMB benefits, but are
    not certain, should call the Medicare Hotline at 1-800-638-6833 for the number of the
    Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program nearest you. Or, send a self-addressed stamped
    letter size envelope to Families USA/Shortchanged, 1334 G Street, NW, 3rd Floor,
