    National Petroleum Reserve To Oil Leasing And Development</font></strong></td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 6 - The plan offered by Interior Secretary Bruce
    Babbitt to allow oil leasing and development in 4 million acres of America's National
    Petroleum Reserve fails to recognize the critical importance of protecting the Arctic
    Ecosystem and is a bad compromise that will allow giant oil corporations to drill and
    develop previously undisturbed wilderness. The plan opens 87% of the Reserve to leasing,
    while protecting only 13%.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There is no compelling case to be made for why we should sacrifice the unique
    wilderness and wildlife of this area,&quot; emphasized Bruce Hamilton, Conservation
    Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;These are public resources that belong to every
    American and should not be sacrificed to please the oil industry and officials in the
    state of Alaska. While this is a great deal for big oil companies, it puts in jeopardy
    many of Alaska's biological treasures such as the wild caribou herds, numerous bird and
    fish species, moose, and brown bears.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The plan was touted by Secretary Babbitt as a balance between oil development and
    environmental protection. &quot;But in a time when oil and gas prices are at the lowest
    levels in two decades,&quot; argued Hamilton, &quot;there is no need or justification to
    support this plan. While gas prices remain low, we should be shifting away from fossil
    fuel development and burning, not opening up new areas for the oil industry to
    pillage.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    While Secretary Babbitt recognized the unique environmental values of the Colville River
    and Teshekpuk Lake regions and gave them added protection, even they are not fully
    protected under this proposal. The Teshekpuk Lake Caribou Herd is put at risk by this
    proposal by opening up a significant portion of its critical calving area to development.
    16% of the calving area is opened to surface occupancy. The calving area is the most
    critical habitat for the herd and should be fully protected from all development.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This plan permits leasing that relies on stipulations to protect caribou, raptors,
    and waterfowl,&quot; observed Hamilton. &quot;But the Sierra Club believes that all prime
    wildlife areas should be off limits to leasing.&nbsp; There is no national emergency. Why
    should we be inviting oil companies into the most important wildlife habitat areas?&quot;<p align="center"># # #</td>
