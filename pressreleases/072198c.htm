    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 21 - The Violence Policy Center (VPC) today released a
    package of gun industry advertisements showing how high-capacity magazines -- which were
    outlawed under the 1994 assault weapons ban -- are still being sold legally because of a
    loophole in the law. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has announced that she will offer an
    amendment on the Senate floor Wednesday to close the loophole.<br>
    <br>
    The ads expose 10 of the numerous companies that still sell high-capacity &quot;killer
    clips&quot; by taking advantage of the 1994 law's &quot;grandfather clause,&quot; which
    allows the sale of millions of magazines made before the ban took effect. These magazines
    are compatible with many semiautomatic firearms designed both before and after 1994,
    allowing them to fire more than 10 rounds without reloading.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This grandfather clause is a high-capacity loophole,&quot; said VPC Director of
    Federal Policy Kristen Rand. &quot;Just put an old magazine on a new gun and -- voila! --
    you beat the ban. You can have an assault weapon that is very lethal, but perfectly
    legal.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    One company has even taken the sale of killer clips a step further, the VPC ads
    demonstrate. Intratec, which once made the banned TEC-9 assault pistol, now sells a very
    similar weapon called the AB-10. The new gun is constructed with grandfathered TEC-9
    magazines that can fire 32 shots without reloading.<br>
    <br>
    Feinstein's amendment, which she plans to offer to the Commerce/Justice/State
    Appropriations bill, would close the killer clip loophole by amending the assault weapons
    ban to prohibit the transfer or sale of grandfathered magazines.<br>
