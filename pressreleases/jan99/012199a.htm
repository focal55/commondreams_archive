      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - January 21 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">In a further show of contempt for the rule of international law, US officials 
are set to kill another child offender, Amnesty International warned today. Just 
after midnight on 4 February 1999, government officials in Oklahoma intend to 
execute Sean Sellers for crimes he committed in 1986, when he was just 16 years 
old.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Sean Sellers has spent the whole of his adult life under a death 
threat. It is time for that threat to be lifted,&quot; Amnesty International 
said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The fact that it is not actually a child who will be taken from his 
cell, strapped down and injected with lethal chemicals should not make this 
premeditated killing easier for society to tolerate.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The ban on the use of the death penalty for those under 18 at the time of the 
crime is so widely accepted, and adhered to, throughout the international 
community, that it has become a principle of customary international law. No 
country can exempt itself from this global ban, no matter what human rights 
agreements it has or has not signed up to.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The US authorities know that by executing child offenders they are 
breaking international law,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yet, in a continuing display of contempt for international human rights 
standards, which negates its claims to the high moral ground on human rights, 
the USA believes that it is above the law on this issue.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, the USA has executed 12 people for 
crimes committed when they were 17. Sean Sellers would be the first person put 
to death for a crime committed at 16.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean Sellers' execution would bring the number of child offenders put to 
death in the USA since 1990 to ten -- more than in the rest of the world 
combined. Five other countries -- Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and 
Yemen -- are known to have executed child offenders since 1990, killing nine 
between them. Yemen has since changed its law to exempt under 18-year-olds from 
the death penalty.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The killing of Sean Sellers would confirm the USA as the single leading 
perpetrator of this calculated human rights violation,&quot; Amnesty 
International said, pointing out that the three known executions of child 
offenders in 1998 all took place in the USA.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;There is no excuse for the most powerful economy in the world not to be 
able to find a better response to the violent crimes of these children than to 
kill them. The international community must demand an end to this outrage,&quot; 
the organization added.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>The world has agreed that children should be exempted 
from execution, not to excuse their crimes or to belittle the suffering of their 
victims and their relatives, but in recognition of young people's immaturity and 
the greater scope for change in them. Sean Sellers' self-development, despite 
spending most of his adult life in one of the harshest prison regimes in the 
USA, is testament to this.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Convention on the Rights of the Child has confirmed the global consensus 
that killing child offenders is wrong. All countries apart from the USA and 
Somalia have agreed to be bound by the Convention's ban on the death penalty 
against those who commit crimes when under 18.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR), which came 
into force in 1977, bans the use of the death penalty against child offenders. 
The USA reserved the right to ignore this ban when it ratified the Covenant in 
1992. However, UN experts have repeatedly ruled that the reservation is invalid 
and should be withdrawn and eleven countries have lodged formal objections it.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean Sellers was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder of his mother and 
stepfather, Vonda and Paul Bellofatto, and of Robert Bower, an Oklahoma 
shopkeeper.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1998, a US federal court acknowledged undisputed expert testimony of 
serious mental illness that may have led him to commit his crimes, but stated 
that it was unable to prevent his execution.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The US federal authorities continue to maintain that the application of the 
death penalty to child offenders is an issue for individual US states and the US 
Supreme Court to determine. However, under international law, the federal system 
of government cannot be used to justify a breach of a country's international 
obligations.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Some 70 other prisoners remain on death row in the USA for crimes committed 
when they were 16 or 17.</font>

The imminent execution of Sean Sellers (AMR 51/108/98, December 1998). Also, On
