        - January 28 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">On the day when the Pope repeated his appeal against the death penalty, 
respect for human rights in the USA hit another low with the Oklahoma Pardon and 
Parole Board's vote to execute Sean Sellers for crimes committed when he was a 
child, Amnesty International said .</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The five members of the board yesterday ruled without hesitation that Sellers 
should not be granted mercy. After the hearing, one of the Board members told 
the media &quot;I hope this sends a message to all the 16-year-olds of this 
state&quot;.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The only message this decision sends to 16-year-olds and the rest of US 
society is that killing is the appropriate response to killing,&quot; Amnesty 
International commented.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The international community has agreed that executing people for crimes 
committed when they are under 18 is wrong,&quot; the organization continued. 
&quot;However, the USA considers itself above international law.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean Sellers, who would be the first prisoner executed for a crime committed 
at 16 since the USA resumed judicial killing in 1977, is scheduled to be 
executed on 4 February. Amnesty International will continue its efforts to stop 
his execution.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Sean Sellers shot his mother and stepfather in 1986. 
Among those appealing to the board to deny clemency were members of his own 
family. His stepsister urged that he be put to death. As Sean Sellers -- wearing 
handcuffs and leg irons -- wept while telling the board of his remorse, one of 
his uncles, who had already urged that clemency be denied, shouted across the 
room &quot;Stop begging. Take the punishment.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean Sellers told the Board that he could never make up for his crimes, but 
that he wanted to continue his work from prison to help disturbed teenagers. 
&quot;I cannot imagine what I could say today that would cause you to have mercy 
on me,&quot; he reportedly said to the Board. &quot;The only thing I know to do 
is try to show you my heart.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On the day of the hearing, in neighboring Missouri, Pope John Paul II 
challenged US Catholics to reject the cruelty of the death penalty, saying that 
&quot;A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human 
life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great 
evil. Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively 
denying criminals the chance to reform&quot;. In Oklahoma, the state Governor, a 
Catholic, welcomed the Board's vote on Sean Sellers. The USA executed three 
child offenders in 1998, the only such executions known in the world. The 
execution of Sean Sellers would mean that the USA has put to death more child 
offenders since 1990 than the rest of the world combined.</font>

USA to confirm its position as world leader in killing child offenders&quot; (AI

imminent execution of Sean Sellers&quot; (AI INDEX:AMR 51/108/98)</font></P></td>
