        - January 12 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Gulf War Resource Center
        (NGWRC), the largest Gulf War veterans 
organization in the country, has come out against economic sanctions which 
&quot;prevent or otherwise hamper nations from maintaining the public health of 
their people.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Comprising over 54 member groups from around the country, 
the NGWRC works to be a resource for information, support, and referrals for all 
those concerned with the complexities of Gulf War issues, especially Gulf War 
illnesses. Already successful in passing a comprehensive bill to ensure better 
health care for sick veterans, the NGWRC is now focusing on Depleted Uranium (DU) and protecting both U.S. troops and civilians from DU exposure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a 
resolution that was passed by the Board of Directors on December 20, 1998, 
shortly after the December air strike, the NGWRC urges that further civilian 
casualties in Iraq be avoided. &quot;As soldiers, we were trained to abide by 
international laws relating to the treatment and protection of civilian 
populations. Economic sanctions which prevent or otherwise hamper nations from 
maintaining the public health of their citizens, are in violation of these 
international laws, including Geneva Protocol 1, Article 54, which prohibits the 
'starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.' The UN and the U.S. must work 
toward an immediate end to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.&quot;</font></p>

Gulf War Veterans Express Concern About Recent Developments in 
the 8-Year War</FONT>
        </P>
        </B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The United States (U.S.) became involved in the Gulf War with 
the passage of Public Law 102-1, still in effect, that allows the President to 
use military force against Iraq in order to enforce Iraqi compliance with United 
Nations (UN) resolutions.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Gulf War Resource Center
(NGWRC) believes the 
following important lessons must not be forgotten regarding the Gulf War, a war 
that continues to impact millions of lives.</font> </P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Iraq possessed and deployed chemical warfare agents up to 1991.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1991, with the U.S. military destruction of Iraq's chemical weapons
  (CW) 
facilities, tons of agents were released, possibly exposing up to 100,000 
American servicemen and women, according to the U.S. Department of Defense 
(DOD).</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The U.S. uses depleted uranium (DU) in anti-tank ammunition. Scientists have 
associated DU, a radioactive toxic waste, with many adverse health effects. 
Since 1990, thousands of American troops have been exposed to DU, as have 
millions of Iraqis. The World Health Organization plans to investigate the 
possible link between a reported sharp increase in cancer incidents in Southern 
Iraq and DU exposure.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The U.S. DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs have estimated that 110,000 
American Gulf War veterans are ill as a result of their wartime service, many 
from exposures to CW, DU, pollution from oil well fires, experimental vaccines, 
and anti-nerve agent pretreatment pills, among other toxins.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The economic sanctions on Iraq now result in serious shortages of food, 
clean water, and medicine. Water and sanitation systems have collapsed, fueling 
an epidemic of diseases. Denis J. Halliday, the former UN head of the 
oil-for-food program, estimates that over 5,000 Iraqi children under five are 
dying each month from malnutrition and disease directly related to the 
sanctions. Meanwhile, the Iraqi government remains untouched and firmly 
entrenched.</font></LI></UL>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">Therefore, the National Gulf War Resource Center Board of 
Directors, after careful and thorough deliberation, urges the following steps be 
taken to ensure the protection of American forces and civilians in the Persian 
Gulf region. No active duty service man or woman should ever have to go through 
what so many Gulf War veterans and their families have had to go through.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to the likely exposure to CW,
DU, and other hazardous 
toxins, the NGWRC demands that the best training and protective gear be provided 
to American forces deployed in the Persian Gulf region, as well as the best 
health care, both while deployed and upon their return home. American soldiers 
should return in a timely fashion, safely, and in good health.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The NGWRC strongly believes that further civilian casualties in 
Iraq must be avoided. As soldiers, we were trained to abide by international 
laws relating to the treatment and protection of civilian populations. </font> 
<B><font size="2" face="Arial">Economic sanctions which prevent or otherwise hamper nations from maintaining 
the public health of their citizens (as opposed to targeted military and 
diplomatic sanctions), are in violation of these international laws, including 
Geneva Protocol 1, Article 54, which prohibits the &quot;starvation of civilians 
as a method of warfare.&quot; The UN and the U.S. must work toward an immediate 
end to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.</font></P></B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">With recent air strikes, the Gulf War continues. THE NGWRC is 
deeply concerned about the safety of the 30,000-40,000 American service members 
in the Gulf region and civilians in the combat zone. The NGWRC will follow 
events closely and work to ensure the veterans of Desert Shield, Storm, and Fox 
receive proper protection, health care and benefits for their war time 
service.</font></P>
