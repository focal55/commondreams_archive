        LOUIS - January 20 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">A broad range of state and national consumer groups today came together to 
announce their opposition to the proposed merger between SBC Communications, 
Inc. and Ameritech Corporation. Groups representing an array of geographically 
and institutionally diverse entities, including organizations from the major 
states served by SBC and Ameritech, released a jointly prepared white paper 
entitled, The Consumer Case Against the SBC-Ameritech Merger. The release of the 
white paper serves as a call to state and federal regulators to stop the merger. 
<BR></font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We have concluded that the merger would be a severe blow to the 
development of competition in local telecommunications markets, particularly for 
residential consumers,&quot; said Martha Hogerty, Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, speaking on behalf of the groups. &quot;The sheer size of the firm that 
would be created by the merger dwarfs virtually all competitors in the 
industry,&quot; she added.<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The merger will be a devastating blow to the feeble forces of 
competition that have been struggling to become established,&quot; Janee 
Briesemeister of the Southwest Regional Office of Consumers Union said. 
&quot;Bigger companies mean fewer choices and higher prices for 
consumers.&quot;<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Claims of the competitive benefits of the SBC-Ameritech merger ring 
hollow when one considers that despite the concerted efforts of the Michigan 
Legislature, the Michigan Public Service Commission and my office to foster 
competition, Ameritech-Michigan still serves over 96 percent of the access lines 
in its service territory,&quot; said Jennifer M. Granholm, Michigan Attorney 
General. &quot;Clearly, approval of the merger would be a significant setback in 
our effort to bring real competition to the telecommunications market in 
Michigan,&quot; she added.<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is difficult to see how Californians benefited from SBC's 
acquisition of Pacific Bell. We have seen proposals for rate increases, public 
offices have been closed, the company attempted to charge fees to customers 
paying their bills in person, aggressive and misleading marketing tactics have 
been used to oversell services, and the door to competition has been slammed 
shut,&quot; Regina Costa of TURN said. &quot;We fully expect that SBC's poor 
performance in California will be repeated in Ameritech states if this merger is 
permitted.&quot;<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;If the FCC and the DOJ actually approve this merger, consumers end up 
with the worst from both worlds-a major local competition alternative is 
eliminated and customers end up having to absorb the costs of the merger. The 
acquisition cost for Ameritech could well exceed the book value of the company. 
Adding that premium to the premiums SBC has already paid to acquire SNET and 
PacBell, insures that consumers will face higher telephone service costs for 
years to come,&quot; said Rick Guzman of the Texas Office of Public Utility 
Counsel. &quot;So long competition, hello higher prices.&quot; <BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Based upon principles of economics as demonstrated in SBC's own conduct 
in recent years, the merger can be expected to stifle competition, stifle the 
development of new technology and result in further degradation of service 
quality,&quot; Rick Gamber of the Michigan Consumer Federation said. &quot;SBC's 
merger application is so inherently flawed that no combination of conditions 
would be sufficient to protect the public interest against the anti-competitive 
consequences.&quot;<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;SBC had formally identified Chicago as a likely market for entry in 
defending its takeover of PacTel; now it claims it had changed its mind,&quot; 
David Stahr of Citizen Action of Illinois said. &quot;We're convinced that 
Illinois will end up with less competition as a result of this merger, not 
more.&quot; <BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Cook County State's Attorney's Office presented testimony that the 
proposed SBC/Ameritech merger is not in the public interest,&quot; Marie 
Spicuzza of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office said. &quot; SBC proposes 
takeover of Ameritech creates a number of serious risks for Illinois 
consumers.&quot;<BR></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The consumer document released today highlights arguments that include: 
<BR></font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">There is a fundamental difference between the SBC-Ameritech merger and 
previous mergers between local telephone companies that have been approved. The 
merger poses unique regional problems because the greater the market power at 
the regional and national levels, the less the likelihood that competitors will 
break through in the local market and the greater the likelihood that market 
power will extend into related markets.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The SBC-Ameritech merger reduces actual and potential local telephone 
competition. Ameritech began to scale back its local competition efforts after 
merger talks began. <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The SBC-Ameritech merger will make it more difficult for competitors to 
enter local markets in the SBC-Ameritech region. SBC-Ameritech would own about 
one-third of all local telephone lines in the country and would have almost a 50 
percent market share of national business lines. The merger violates the DOJ 
Merger Guidelines on market concentration by a wide margin.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The SBC-Ameritech merger does not provide significant competitive benefits 
in other markets. The merger harms or fails significantly to improve the 
prospects for competition in other markets  such as cable television, cellular 
telephone, and business and long distance markets  and the benefits it claims 
could be achieved in ways that do not harm competition.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">SBC's claims that retaliation by large telephone providers will increase 
competition are illogical and contrary to past Regional Bell Operating Company 
(RBOC) behavior. <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">SBC has shown its willingness to engage in anti-competitive and abusive 
practices. Public interest groups note that SBC has earned a reputation, to 
quote a filing in Ohio proceedings, &quot;as the most energetic Baby Bell in 
resisting competition.&quot; SBC refuses to open the local market and engages in 
abusive marketing tactics.<BR></font></LI></UL>

Communications Commission and the Department of Justice as part of their ongoing 
review of the proposed merger.<BR></font></P>
