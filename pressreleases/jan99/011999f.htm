        YORK - January 19 - </font>In an unusual move, the Internal Revenue Service has gone to
        court to force a long-time Brooklyn pacifist and war tax resister to turn
        over his financial records.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ed Hedemann, who for decades has refused to send his federal income taxes
to the IRS because of his objection to military spending, has been summoned to appear February 1 in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to show cause why
he should not turn over all his financial records to the IRS. A refusal to turn over the records would carry the risk of being sent to prison for
contempt of court.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The IRS served Hedemann the Order to Show Cause December 11 against the
backdrop of renewed U.S. air strikes against Iraq. Just days after unleashing the largest military action since the Gulf War—which cost nearly
2,000 Iraqi lives and more than $500 million of U.S. taxpayers money—Clinton asked Congress for an additional $100 billion for the
Pentagon over the next six years, representing the largest military build-up since the Reagan administration's record spending.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Hedemann began withholding federal taxes in 1972 as a protest against the
Vietnam War.  He has continued to withhold them since then because the federal government has continued to spend 50 to 65 percent of federal
income taxes on present and past military programs.  He files all his tax returns and pays state, local, and social security taxes. Instead of a
check, however, he sends the IRS a note with his federal return explaining why he is sending the entire amount of any taxes due to organizations such
as Voices in the Wilderness, which provides material aid to Iraqi civilians; the New York Times Neediest Cases fund; and a documentary film
project on the U.S.-aided murder of Jesuit priests in El Salvador.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Since 1972, the IRS has routinely sent me threatening notices and levies,
called me at home, harassed organizations I work for, and looked for nonexistent bank accounts and property," notes
Hedemann, "but this is the first time they've ever taken me to court. I guess they're in desperate
need of money to pay for all those cruise missiles."</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people in the U.S. refuse to pay some or all
of their federal taxes because of opposition to war. In the past 30 years only a half dozen war tax resisters have been taken to court; the last such
case was nine years ago.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A support demonstration is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. in front of the U.S.
District Court at 225 Cadman Plaza E. in Brooklyn on Monday, February 1, just before the 4 p.m. hearing. "I don't know what'll happen in court that
day, but I do know that I cannot turn over any papers to the IRS or do anything that'll contribute to the war-making effort of this or any other
country," commented Hedemann.</font></P>
