        - January 29 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The number of union members rose in more than half the states in 1998, according 
to new data made available today from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Union 
membership increased or stabilized in 32 states.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This new state data comes on the heels of data released Monday which showed 
that union membership grew by more than 100,000 nationwide in 1998. The number 
of union members in the U.S. rose from 16.1 to 16.2 million.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">More than half the states also showed an increase in the percentage of its 
overall workforce which is unionized. This is in contrast to the national trend 
which showed that although the number of union members climbed, the share of the 
workforce belonging to unions declined from 14.1 percent to 13.9 percent. This 
was a smaller decline than in the previous year.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">California led the nation with a net increase of 87,000 union members in 
1998. Other states that showed an increase or a stabalization, in order of the 
number of union members added, were: Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, 
Washington, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Connecticut, 
North Carolina, Delaware, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Kansas, 
Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Vermont, Wisconsin, Montana, Arkansas, Wyoming, 
North Dakota, Alaska, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Washington, DC.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">More than half the states also showed an increase in the 
<STRONG>percentage</STRONG> of their workforce which is unionized. These were, 
in alphabetical order: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, 
Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, 
Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This new data confirms that today's unions are on the right 
track,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. &quot;Our commitment and 
dedication to organizing, at all levels of the labor movement, is beginning to 
bear fruit -- but we still have a long way to go. We need to stay focused and 
redouble our efforts. &quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A closer look at individual sectors of the economy shows that unions brought 
in at least 373,000 new members -- in the service, communications and utilities, 
and government sectors. This gain, however, was offset by union job losses in 
such sectors as manufacturing.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The overall rise in union membership is due in large part to aggressive 
organizing efforts of unions. Unions organized more and won more in the first 
half of 1998 compared to the first half of 1997, according to a study by the 
Bureau of National Affairs (BNA). The number of government-supervised union 
elections rose 8.9 percent from 1479 in the first half of 1997 to 1611 in the 
first half of 1998. Workers trying to form unions won more often, winning 51.7 
percent of elections, up from 49.2 percent in 1997. &quot;Clearly, the lesson 
here is that we're not only trying more, we're winning more,&quot; said Kirk 
Adams, AFL-CIO Organizing Director.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the highlights of organizing in 1998 included the 19,000 United 
Airlines passenger service workers who unionized with the International 
Association of Machinists (IAM) in July, the largest single organizing win in 
more than 20 years; the 4500 workers at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas who 
organized in October after their employer agreed to recognize their choice for a 
union; and the 2500 workers at the Sunrise Hospital (Columbia HCA) who organized 
with the Service Employees' International Union (SEIU) this fall in a campaign 
that was a model of unions' new outreach to involve entire communities in 
defending workers' right to organize.</font> </P>
