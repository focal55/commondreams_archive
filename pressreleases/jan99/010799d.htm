<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force denounced a decision to ban gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people in Arkansas from becoming foster 
parents. Yesterday, the Child Welfare Agency Review Board passed a resolution 
that would make Arkansas the second state to enact such a ban. As worded, the 
ban would prevent a child from being placed with anyone who has engaged in 
same-sex sexual behavior or anyone sharing a household with someone who has 
engaged in same-sex sexual behavior. There is a comment period, which will 
likely take a number of weeks and will entail five public hearings, before the 
ban will take effect.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This ban is not about the welfare of children, it’s about attacking and 
demonizing gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people,&quot; said Kerry
Lobel, executive director of the Task Force. &quot;Right-wing extremists are 
aiming their arsenal at our families more than ever before. We will face similar 
battles in a number of states this year, and we will do everything in our power 
to face down these lies, distortions, and myths with the simple truth,&quot; 
added Lobel.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Arkansas would become the third state to ban gay, lesbian, bisexual, or 
transgender people from adopting and/or becoming foster parents. The New 
Hampshire legislature passed a law banning both adoption and foster care in late 
1980s. Florida passed a law banning adoption in 1977. Also, in Oklahoma, people 
convicted under the state's sodomy law are banned from adopting.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the Task Force, similar measures are likely to be introduced 
this year in at least three other states (IN, TX, MI). Last year, anti-adoption 
or anti-foster care measures were introduced in five states (AZ, CA, GA, OK, 
TN). All of them were defeated. Both the New Hampshire and Florida laws are 
currently being contested. In Florida there is a lawsuit challenging the ban, 
and yesterday in New Hampshire advocates introduced a bill (HB 90) that would 
reverse the law.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Regulations like this are responsible for robbing thousands of needy 
children from loving, nurturing, supportive homes. It is time to listen to the 
voices of young people who know that what is important is a good parent, not a 
parent whose sexual orientation has been run through a government-sanctioned 
litmus test,&quot; said Felicia Park-Rogers, Director of the organization 
Children of Lesbians and Gays Everywhere and herself a 27-year old lesbian 
daughter of a gay man and a lesbian.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community and its allies, 
including the Interfaith Alliance for Equality, are organizing to prevent the 
ban from being enacted. &quot;There are many serious problems with Arkansas' 
foster care system. Rather than using time and resources to address them, the 
state is wasting them on a non-issue,&quot; said Judy Matsuoka of the Little 
Rock-based Women's Project, and a coordinator of the efforts to block the ban.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Many organizations, including the Child Welfare League, the North American 
Council on Adoptable Children, and the American Psychological Association oppose 
the use of sexual orientation as a criteria in foster care and adoption 
placement.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Judy Matsuoka of the Women's Project is available at (501) 372-5113 for 
information about local efforts to block the ban. Felicia Park Rogers of COLAGE 
is available for further comment at (415) 861-5437.</font> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, 
violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at 
the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a 
broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is 
creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression 
and identity where all people may fully participate in society.</font></P></td>
