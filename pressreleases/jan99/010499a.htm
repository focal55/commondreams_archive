        - January 4 - </font>The following was released today by Handgun Control Inc.:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">1998 ended on an optimistic note: efforts to reduce and prevent
gun 
deaths and injuries are working. New reports indicate that gun violence 
continues to decline in the U.S. and that the nation's gun laws have a real 
effect on the availability and criminal use of firearms.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, since
implementation of 
the Brady Law in February 1994, background checks on handgun purchasers have 
prevented 242,000 prohibited purchasers from buying a gun from licensed gun 
dealers.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- The FBI's 1997 Uniform Crime Report shows crimes with guns
decreasing 
faster than violent crime overall. Compared to 1994, criminals in 1997 were 
less likely to use a firearm in the commission of a crime. Overall, the 
number of all violent crimes since 1994 has fallen 14 percent while the 
number of violent crimes committed with a firearm since 1994 has fallen 25 
percent.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- On Dec. 31, 1998, the New York Daily News reported that gun
deaths 
have dropped in New York City from more than 1,500 in 1992 to their lowest 
level since 1963. New York has some of the strictest gun licensing laws in 
the nation and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has attributed his city's drop in 
crime directly to that city's gun control laws. New York Police Commissioner 
Howard Safir agrees, and supports even stricter laws including one limiting 
handgun purchases to one a month.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- On Dec. 29, 1998, the Washington Post reported that gun deaths
in the 
District of Columbia have also dropped dramatically. According to the 
report, &quot;police officials attribute the latest decline in homicides to, 
among other things, the increasing difficulty of purchasing guns in Maryland 
and Virginia.&quot; Both states have passed anti-gun trafficking laws which 
limit handguns sales to one per person per month. Such laws greatly reduce 
&quot;straw purchases,&quot; in which an individual who may legally purchase 
a firearm is hired to purchase firearms for an individual who is either prohibited by law from making the purchase (i.e. felons and minors)
or 
does not want to be traced.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- One-Gun-A-Month laws work. Virginia passed a law limiting
handgun 
purchases to one per person per month in 1993. A 1995 study showed that in 
the first year alone, Virginia's law has greatly reduced the number of crime 
guns recovered in other states that were purchased in Virginia. Maryland 
passed its one-gun-a-month law in 1996. One year after enactment, the number 
of Maryland multiple-sale guns turning up at crime scenes in Washington, 
D.C., dropped from 23 to zero, and from 26 to four in Baltimore.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This dramatic decrease in gun violence debunks the gun lobby's
myth 
that gun control doesn't work,&quot; said Sarah Brady, chair of Handgun 
Control Inc. &quot;Common sense laws can and have worked. The gun lobby 
claims that 'an armed society is a polite society,' when, in fact, the 
opposite is true. These reports show that fewer guns on our streets means 
less crime and less violence.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;While we are grateful for this news, we know that more can and
must 
be done,&quot; Mrs. Brady continued. &quot;We have eliminated a number of sources for crime guns but loopholes still exist which allow
criminals 
to &quot;lie and buy.&quot; We need to institute a national one-gun-a-month 
law to reduce gun trafficking to criminals even further. We need to close 
the gun show loophole which allows so-called &quot;private collectors&quot; 
at gun shows to sell their wares to anyone without doing a criminal 
background check.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We also need to reinstate the Brady Law's waiting period which
expired on November 30, 1998. A waiting period gives local law enforcement time to conduct a thorough background check and acts as a
&quot;cooling-off&quot; period for gun purchasers considering crimes of 
passion or impulse suicides. And as always, those who violate gun laws and commit gun crimes must be prosecuted.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Much work remains to be done, but I am proud of the progress we
have made. As we begin a new year, I look forward to working with law 
enforcement, elected officials, the medical community, religious leaders and 
others to continue to reduce gun violence in this great nation.&quot;</font> 
<P align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">------</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control Inc. chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's
largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and
local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI 
has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around 
the country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws. More 
information about HCI and its affiliated organization, the Center to Prevent 
Handgun Violence, can be found on the website at <A
