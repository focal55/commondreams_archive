        - January 29 - </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Ambassador,</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 26 October 1998 Amnesty International addressed the plenary session of the 
Human Dimension Implementation Meeting in Warsaw on its concerns regarding the 
death penalty in the OSCE region. A large part of that address focused on the 
use of the death penalty within one participating state of the OSCE, namely the 
United States of America. Amnesty International expressed its deep disquiet at 
the continuing violation of international standards in that country's 
application of the death penalty. The organization highlighted the USA's 
continuing use of the death penalty against those under 18 at the time of the 
crime, a practice forbidden under international law, and on in which no other 
OSCE participating state engages.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">It is therefore with a very great sense of urgency that the organization is 
writing to draw your attention to the imminent execution, on 4 February 1999, of 
Sean Sellers in Oklahoma, USA, for crimes committed when he was 16 years old. 
Sean Sellers would be the first prisoner put to death in the USA for a crime 
committed when under 17, since judicial executions were resumed in 1977. As 
such, his killing would represent a further appalling development in the USA's 
use of the death penalty and would send a disturbing message to the 
international community from a country which repeatedly claims to be the most 
progressive force for human rights in the world.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International appeals to you to urge the US authorities to abide by 
international law and to stop this execution. This has been made all the more 
urgent by the fact that on 27 January 1999 the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board 
voted to deny Sean Sellers clemency.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The prohibition of the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by those 
under 18 is now a principle of customary international law from which no country 
is exempt, irrespective of whether or not it has ratified the relevant 
international human rights instruments.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As early as 1949, Article 68 of the Fourth Geneva Convention established that 
the death penalty could not be pronounced on persons who were under 18 at the 
time of the offence. The unacceptability of this punishment against juvenile 
offenders, even in times of war, was thereby recognized. In the 50 years since 
then, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, together with various other international 
and regional human rights instruments, have come into force and confirmed 18 as 
the minimum age for death penalty eligibility.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">One hundred and ninety-one states -- all except the USA and Somalia -- have 
ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. No state has made a 
specific reservation to Article 37(a) which prohibits the use of the death 
penalty against those under 18 at the time of the crime. This overwhelming 
consensus confirms the exemption of juvenile offenders from the death penalty as 
a principle of customary international law.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Only three executions of juvenile offenders were recorded worldwide in 1998. 
All three were carried out in the USA. Eighteen executions of juvenile offenders 
are known to have been carried out since 1990, nine in the USA. Only five other 
countries are known to have carried out such executions in the same period. At 
least one of them - Yemen - has since legislated to abolish the death penalty 
against those under 18 at the time of the crime. Also of note is the fact that 
China, which accounts for most of the world's judicial executions, changed its 
Criminal Code in 1997 to exempt juvenile offenders from the death penalty.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The USA claims to have exempted itself from the international consensus by 
lodging a reservation to Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. However, the UN Human Rights Committee has stated that the 
reservation is contrary to the object and purpose of the treaty and should be 
withdrawn. The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions reiterated this in his report on the USA in 1998, and concluded that 
the US practice of imposing the death penalty on child offenders violates 
international law.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In April 1998 the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution calling 
on all member states which still use the death penalty to establish a moratorium 
on executions, with a view to abolishing the death penalty altogether. The 
resolution specifically urged all States that still maintain the death penalty 
to &quot;comply fully with their obligations under the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
notably not... to impose it for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years 
of age...&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The US federal authorities have consistently maintained that the issue of 
juveniles and the death penalty is a matter for individual US states to 
determine, within the constraints set by the US Supreme Court. However, as 
Amnesty International and UN experts have repeatedly pointed out to the 
authorities, the federal system cannot be used to justify a breach of the USA's 
international human rights obligations.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I appeal to you to urge the US authorities to intervene to stop the execution 
of Sean Sellers, and for them to ratify without reservation the UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and to withdraw their reservation to Article 6(5) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If you should wish for further information on the case of Sean Sellers, there 
is an Amnesty International document available from this office by fax or 
e-mail: Killing Hope - The Imminent Execution of Sean Sellers (AMR 51/108/98, 
December 1998). It gives details of Sean Sellers' childhood, his crimes, his 
trial and appeals, his mental illness and his self-development in prison.</font>
