<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Georgia Commission on the Holocaust has deleted from a teachers' guide 
the only two paragraphs addressing the persecution of gay men in the Holocaust. 
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force denounced the commission's action.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">There is a rally today in Atlanta of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
transgender (GLBT) community and its allies within the Jewish community who have 
denounced the commission's action. In addition, tomorrow community leaders will 
meet with the Georgia Holocaust Commission to demand a reprinting of the guide 
with the deleted paragraphs reinserted. They will also request that a resource 
booklet on gays in the Holocaust published by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum 
be distributed to middle school teachers along with the guide. Jane Seville, a 
board member of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and a former board 
member of Bet Haverim, a GLBT synagogue in Atlanta, will attend the meeting 
along with Harry Knox of Georgia Equality Project and Steve Kovall of the 
Atlanta Executive Network.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Below is a statement from Task Force executive director Kerry Lobel followed 
by the two paragraphs that were deleted from the guide.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This decision by the commission is deeply troubling and dangerous. The 
Holocaust has taught us about the insidiousness of hate and intolerance, which 
can take root quickly and deeply in a society. The Holocaust has taught us to be 
vigilant against hatred, intolerance, and ignorance Ð in all their forms and 
manifestations.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As a Jew, I am chilled by this attempt to erase gay men from the pages of 
Holocaust history. It is hate we must erase, not history. How ironic that this 
curriculum, intended to teach tolerance and understanding, will now foster more 
misunderstanding and intolerance.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">It is our hope that the commissioners will take the lessons of the Holocaust 
to heart. If they do, then they will have no other choice but to include in the 
curriculum the full truth about the persecution of gay men by the Nazis. We 
implore the commissioners to look to the work of the United States Holocaust 
Museum in Washington, DC where the stories of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals 
are woven into every aspect of Holocaust history.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The words of Pastor Martin Niemoller serve us well in remembering the 
Holocaust's most important lesson to all humanity:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In Germany they first came for the communists and I didn't speak up 
because I wasn't a communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up 
because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't 
speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, 
and I didn't speak up because I was a protestant. Then they came for me Ð and by 
that time no one was left to speak up.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The two paragraphs deleted from the guide:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;German male homosexuals were targeted and arrested because they would 
not breed the master race: they were an affront to the Nazi macho image.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The doors of the third [cattle] car open and the homosexuals spill 
forth, males only, because as Himmler concluded, 'lesbians can give birth.' The 
taunting jeers, and blows of the guards stun the men. They will stay a night and 
then be rerouted to Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald to be with their kind. The pink 
triangle they will soon wear is a result of a judgment that they have broken 
Article 175A, by sexual act, by kissing, by embracing, by fantasy and thought. 
Some will be given an opportunity to recant by successfully completing sexual 
activity with a woman in the camp brothel. Most others will find themselves 
tormented from all sides as they struggle to avoid being assaulted, raped, 
worked, and beaten to death.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For more information about local organizing efforts to reverse the 
commission's actions, contact the Georgia Equality Project at (404) 872-3600.

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, 
violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at
