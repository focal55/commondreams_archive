        - January 9 - </font>Senator Paul Wellstone announced today in Minnesota that he
        would not be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2000. In a statement delivered to supporters and
        media in Minnesota, Senator Wellstone outlined the rationale for his decision to bring to a close his exploratory effort, and
        expressed deep gratitude to his supporters across the country.</font>

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P><font face="Arial">Excerpts from that statement follow:</font> </P>

        </FONT>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"I have always been a Senator who has given 100 percent to my
work. As I've traveled across the country to explore the prospects for a formal Presidential bid--a process which I have loved and from
which I have drawn ideas, inspiration and hope from those whom I've met--I have become persuaded, over time, that I could not
energetically represent the people of Minnesota in the United States Senate while simultaneously running a grueling, 7-days-a-
week, 6-cities-in-a-day kind of campaign for the White House. And that is especially true given the kind of activist, people-centered,
grassroots-oriented service I intend to continue to provide as a Senator. For me, Minnesota must continue to come first."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"The nature of the physically grueling modern campaign has also
frankly played a role in shaping my decision. Since my wrestling days in college, I have had a long history of painful but manageable
back troubles, aggravated most recently by a ruptured disk in my lower back. A year ago I had successful spinal surgery at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Over the holidays I had an annual review of my progress, in which the physicians gave me a clean bill of
health, and a very good prognosis."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"But it is also clear to me that I could not maintain the blistering
pace of national travel, meetings, speaking and organizing that a presidential campaign requires for almost two years--including
getting in and out of countless planes, cars, maybe even a green bus somewhere along the way. While I am absolutely confident
that my back problems will not pose an obstacle to my energetically representing Minnesotans in the Senate, as I have
been doing for years, the extraordinary rigors of a presidential campaign pose a starkly different and much more grueling physical
challenge."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"I had, frankly, thought I could manage that challenge. I no longer
believe that. And that belief simply underscored my conclusion that I could not play both roles--those of an activist Minnesota
Senator and presidential candidate--as well, as energetically, as faithfully, as I would want. I love the people of my state too much,
and owe them too much, to fail in any way to live up to the commitment that I made to them when I took the oath of office as a
Senator."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"At the same time, I am fiercely determined to continue to speak
out on issues of national importance, including by offering a progressive perspective in key Congressional races and in the
Presidential campaign leading up to 2000, insisting that the real issues of people's lives be again placed front and center on the
table of American politics, just as they are squarely on the kitchen tables of most Americans. We must somehow reconnect our
politics to our people in this way, and I believe we can.... The shape and future direction of our politics will largely be determined
by who controls Congress, and who is in the White House, after 2000. I intend to be a full, vigorous, and active participant in those
debates."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"To my supporters here and across the country who will be
disappointed with my decision, I can only promise that I'll continue to fight, with the same passion and energy, for the causes in which
we believe from my post in the U.S. Senate. I am deeply grateful for your support. I must admit honestly that, because I so much
wanted to be able to do this race, in the way I had originally envisioned, a part of me is very saddened that I could not go
forward," Wellstone said.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During the past year Senator Wellstone had explored a potential
bid for the Democratic nomination during visits to the early primary and caucus states of Iowa and New Hampshire. He
had established a Presidential Exploratory Committee to assist in that effort.</font> </P>
