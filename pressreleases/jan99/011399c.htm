WEST YELLOWSTONE, MT - January 13 - </font>Today the Department of Livestock hazed eight bull buffalo from Red Canyon, 
forced them to run 8 miles back towards Yellowstone Park, and pushed them into 
the Duck Creek Capture facility. Two more hungry buffalo who had been hazed into 
the park in a prior DOL hazing operation were lured into facility today prior to 
the hazing operation.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The eight buffalo were eating piles of hay that were left in Red Canyon by 
the landowner, Mike Manship. The piles have attracted numerous bison and over 
100 elk to the canyon.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">APHIS has stated its willingness to accept the presence of bison who pose a 
low risk for brucellosis transmission for up to 60 days prior to the return of 
cattle to the area. These low risk animals are defined as untested bulls, 
yearlings, calves and non-pregnant females. There are no cattle in the conflict 
zone west of the park until June. The presence of brucellosis exposed buffalo in 
the state is not cause for revocation of Montana's brucellosis free status under 
APHIS guidelines.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Patrick Collins, director of legislative and public affairs for APHIS said 
that their agency has been working with state vets from other states to insure 
that these states do not impose sanctions against Montana beef. He stated, 
&quot;If they don't have a scientific basis (for threatening sanctions), we've 
been pretty successful in getting them to back off.&quot; (Bozeman Daily 
Chronicle, Saturday, January 9).</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The state Board of Livestock will meet January 21-22 in Helena to consider a 
policy of leniency towards &quot;low risk&quot; bison. Seven of the eight 
buffalo slaughtered on Friday were bulls, who are considered low risk. All of 
the buffalo captured today are also bulls.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Why is the state of Montana so stubbornly insistent that they have a 
right to kill these buffalo? Every indication shows that the Montana livestock 
industry will not be hurt by allowing buffalo to enter the state, yet they 
continue their illogical practices of killing. The Department of Livestock 
should not be allowed to manage the Greater Yellowstone bison herd,&quot; said 
Buffalo Nations spokesperson Sue Nackoney.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Department of Livestock continues to bait buffalo from Yellowstone Park 
into the capture facility. Buffalo Nations volunteers attempted numerous times 
to prevent the two buffalo from entering the facility, but the buffalo finally 
bolted past them in order to reach the hay. When the Department of Livestock 
puts hay in the facility, buffalo who are a half mile back in the park smell the 
hay and are almost unstoppable as they walk into the facility.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;After witnessing over 10 of the DOL hazing efforts where they have 
spent thousands of tax dollars, it seems ironic to watch the same agency bait 
these same animals back out of the park to their capture facility located on the 
park's border,&quot; stated Michael Mease of Buffalo Nations.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On Friday, January 8, the Department of Livestock killed 8 buffalo that it 
captured at its Duck Creek Capture facility. Three Buffalo Nations volunteers 
were arrested for non-violently attempting to stop the transport of the bison to 
the slaughterhouse.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Buffalo Nations will be here to stand with these buffalo until they are 
free to live on their winter habitat without being chased, captured, or killed. 
Until this happens, many of us feel in our hearts that non-violent direct action 
is the only way to stop this senseless tragedy,&quot; said Michael Bowersox, 
Buffalo Nations spokesperson.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Buffalo Nations and the local community will be holding a vigil for the 
captive buffalo at the base of Duck Creek Road on highway 191 (near intersection 
of rte 287) beginning at 7:00 a.m.</font>
