        - January 20 - </font>Common Cause today called on the United States Senate to conduct all 
deliberations in the impeachment trial of President Clinton in open session 
rather than behind closed doors.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In a letter to all Senators, Common Cause President Ann

rules to allow for open deliberations.</font>

demonstrate that your decision was the product of a careful weighing of 
the evidence in light of constitutional dictates, and the conscience of each

closed doors. Instead, this is an opportunity for the Senate to rise to the 
occasion, as it has done before in our history.&quot; <BR>------ <BR>For

<BR>The text of the Common Cause letter to the Senate follows: <BR>------ 
<BR>January 20, 1999</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Senator:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">An impeachment trial of a President is one of the most serious and
important governmental proceedings undertaken by the Senate. In your deliberations in the trial now underway, you will debate whether --
for 
only the second time in American history -- the Senate should remove a 
sitting President from office.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Because of the profound public importance of these proceedings,
Common 
Cause urges you to support the motion to be proposed by Senators Tom Harkin 
(D-Iowa) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) which would ensure that the 
deliberations of the Senate are open to public scrutiny.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We take this position keenly aware of the gravity of your
responsibility. 
Much depends not only on what decision the Senate makes, but also on how its 
makes this decision. The institutional integrity of the Senate is at stake. 
The Senate can achieve a moment of real statesmanship if it sets aside -- 
and is seen to set aside -- pettiness and partisanship in order to reach, 
not only a wise decision, but one made in the Senate's tradition of open and thoughtful debate.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This cannot happen under the current rules, which will shut
citizens out 
of key portions of the trial. Under these rules, witnesses will be 
questioned and lawyers will debate in open session, but Senators will speak 
their minds only in private, behind closed doors. The secrecy extends to 
deliberations about trial procedures, such as the calling of witnesses. The 
public will learn only how each Senator voted, not why.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In a democracy, the public has a right to know not only what the
government decides, but why and by what process,&quot; President Gerald Ford noted in 1976. The Senate's final decision in the impeachment
trial 
will be public, but American citizens will not know the two other key 
elements of open government -- the &quot;why and by what process&quot; this 
decision was reached.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The work of the Senate must be conducted in public for its
decisions to 
command the respect of the public. If the Senate deliberates in secret, 
there will forever be lingering questions about what happened and why. But 
by opening your discussions to public view, you will have the best 
opportunity to demonstrate that your decision was the product of a careful 
weighing of the evidence in light of constitutional dictates, and the 
conscience of each Member. We urge you not to shrink from the occasion by 
retreating behind closed doors. Instead, this is an opportunity for the 
Senate to rise to the occasion, as it has done before in our history.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Although there are serious arguments in favor of the existing
rules, the 
need for openness and accountability far outweighs those arguments:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Some argue that the Senate functions as a jury, and jurors
deliberate 
in secret. But as the Chief Justice's ruling last week made clear, the 
Senate is much more than a jury. Senators determine the law, not just the 
facts. Senators may make motions, submit questions to witnesses, and voice 
their opinions outside the Senate floor, speaking their mind freely to 
reporters. At bottom, the impeachment decision is not a vote taken by a 
sequestered jury, but a vote by the people's elected representatives on the 
people's business. Like any vote on public business, it should be debated in public.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Some argue that Senators need to work in private to be
able to forge 
bipartisan compromises, such as the unanimous consent agreement on the 
preliminary format for the impeachment trial. Ensuring the Senate debate is 
public, however, does not prevent Senators from holding similar caucuses in 
private, or stop Senate leaders from meeting together to develop bipartisan 
solutions.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Some argue that TV coverage will tempt Senators to play to the
cameras, indulging in highly charged partisan rhetoric. But this is a 
cynical view. Surely Senators can find the self-discipline to comport 
themselves well, even in the glare of media attention. We agree with The New 
York Times, which editorialized: &quot;If openness drives senators towards 
partisanship or prolixity...let public scrutiny serve as the governor of 
their excesses.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Some argue that the impeachment proceedings are unique, and in
unique 
circumstances -- such as personnel matters or questions pertaining to 
sensitive defense information -- elected officials may meet in private. But 
it is difficult to recall any other proceeding in American history that has 
been more open to public scrutiny up until this point. All the impeachment 
proceedings in the House were public. The House voted to release the 
President's videotaped deposition before a grand jury, even though grand 
jury proceedings are always secret. Legislators have released testimony and 
documents gathered by the Independent Counsel, regardless of the sensitivity 
or explicitness of their contents. It is simply not credible to insist at this late juncture that the impeachment deliberations demand
secrecy 
because of their unique nature.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A two-thirds vote is needed to change these impeachment rules, but
the 
Senate should act to do so. These rules -- developed over 130 years ago for 
the trial of President Andrew Johnson -- are an anachronism in 1999, a 
throwback to a very different time and a very different chamber. This veil 
of secrecy has no place in an American democracy at the dawn of the 21st 
Century. In this era of instantaneous mass communications, citizens properly 
consider openness in government one of their rights. Now C-SPAN carries congressional floor debates to Americans
throughout the country. The Internet gives minute-by-minute updates on public affairs. E-mail
links 
millions to their elected representatives. This access should not now be 
choked off by outdated and restrictive rules.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Common Cause founder, John Gardner, may have put it best when he
remarked 
in 1974: &quot;Secrecy is fatal to accountability.&quot; Gardner's words 
remain true today. Senators are the public's elected representatives. 
Citizens, as participants in a democratic society, must be able to witness 
the Senate impeachment debate. The American public must be able to gauge the 
judgment, partisanship and wisdom of their Senators who will determine, for 
only the second time in American history, whether to remove an elected 
President from office.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We strongly urge you to support the Harkin-Wellstone motion to
ensure the 
Senate's deliberations on this important matter of state are not held in 
secret.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely, <BR> </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ann McBride <BR>President</font>
