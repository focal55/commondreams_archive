        YORK - January 29 -
Human Rights Watch today categorically rejected Yugoslav government claims that 
the victims of the January 15 attack on Racak were either Kosovo Liberation Army 
soldiers killed in combat, or civilians caught in crossfire.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">After a detailed investigation, the organization accused Serbian special police 
forces and the Yugoslav army of indiscriminately attacking civilians, torturing 
detainees, and committing summary executions. The evidence suggests that 
government forces had direct orders to kill village inhabitants over the age of 
fifteen.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The killing of forty-five ethnic Albanian civilians has provoked an apparent 
shift in western policy toward Kosovo, which the Contact Group is meeting in 
London today to discuss.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A report in the Washington Post yesterday provided excerpts from telephone 
conversations between Serbian Interior Ministry General Sreten Lukic and 
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, who clearly ordered government 
security forces to &quot;go in heavy&quot; in Racak. The two officials later 
discussed ways that the killings might be covered up to avoid international 
condemnation.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch conducted separate interviews in Kosovo with fourteen 
witnesses to the attack, many of whom are hiding out of fear for their lives, as 
well as with foreign journalists and observers who visited Racak on January 16. 
Together, the testimonies suggest a well planned and executed attack by 
government forces on civilians in Racak, where the KLA had a sizable presence 
and had conducted some ambushes on police patrols.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As has happened on numerous occasions in the Kosovo conflict, once the KLA 
retreated, government forces moved in and committed atrocities against the 
residents of the village. While it is possible that some residents may have 
defended their homes in the morning, most were clearly not involved in any armed 
resistance. At least twenty-three people were summarily executed by the police 
while offering no resistance -- a clear violation of the laws of war, and a 
crime punishable by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia (ICTY).</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Villagers told consistent stories of how government forces rounded up, 
tortured, and then apparently executed the twenty-three ethnic Albanians on a 
hill outside of the village. Two witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch saw 
these men being beaten by the police and then taken off in the direction of the 
hill. Local villagers, foreign journalists, and diplomatic observers who saw the 
bodies the next day said that the victims had been shot from close range, most 
of them in the head; some of them appeared to have been shot while running away. 
Four men are known to have survived.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Eighteen other people were killed inside Racak, including a twelve-year-old 
boy and at least two female civilians, as well as nine soldiers of the KLA. At 
least one civilian, Nazmi Ymeri (76), was executed in his yard. Witnesses claim 
that Banush Kamberi, whose headless body was found in his yard, was last seen 
alive in the custody of the police. At least two people, Bajram Mehmeti and his 
daughter Hanumshahe (20), were killed by a grenade thrown by the police as they 
were running through the street.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch confirmed that a group of approximately forty policeman, 
in blue uniforms and without masks, shot from a distance of twenty meters on 
unarmed civilians who were running through their yards. They killed Riza Beqa 
(44), Zejnel Beqa (22), and Halim Beqa (12), and wounded two women, Zyhra Beqa 
(42) and her daughter Fetije (18). It is believed that local policemen from the 
nearby Stimlje police station participated in this action.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The attack on civilians in Racak is one in a long series of war crimes 
committed by the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police during the Kosovo conflict. 
Since February 1998, government troops have systematically destroyed civilian 
property, attacked civilians, and committed summary executions, all of which are 
grave breaches of the laws of war. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has also 
committed some serious abuses, such as the taking of civilian hostages and 
summary executions (documented in the Human Rights Watch report 
&quot;Humanitarian Law Violations in Kosovo&quot; available, along with other 
Kosovo reports, on the web site <a href="http://www.hrw.org">www.hrw.org</a> ). The KLA in the Shtimle and Suva 
Reka area was particularly known for a high number of kidnappings of ethnic 
Serbs.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch called on the Yugoslav government to allow an unhindered 
investigation by international forensics experts and the war crimes tribunal to 
determine the precise nature of events. Government authorities, directly 
implicated in the crime, cannot be trusted to conduct an impartial 
investigation.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization also called on the international community to take resolute 
action against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his government for 
brazenly violating international humanitarian law. International inaction in the 
face of past atrocities, the organization said, gave President Milosevic the 
rightful impression that he could continue his abusive campaign with impunity.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, Human Rights Watch called on the Contact Group to insist that the 
Chief Prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, be granted access to Racak and other sites of 
atrocities in Kosovo.</font> </P>
