      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">ZURICH
        - January 12 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Greenpeace today released a leaked document revealing secret negotiations 
between industry officials to allow the dumping of Swiss nuclear waste in 
Russia. Greenpeace has condemned the plans as &quot;illegal&quot; and 
&quot;immoral&quot; and called for both the Swiss and Russian governments to 
intervene and discontinue the negotiations.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The document, leaked to Greenpeace in Switzerland, outlines negotiations held 
in Zurich on September 17, 1998, between representatives of the Swiss nuclear 
utilities (EGL and NOK) and Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) 
officials and their commercial agents (Techsnabexport, Russia and Internexco, 
GmbH, Germany).</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the &quot;Protocol of Intentions&quot;, the Swiss officials request that 
the agreement permit them to send some 2,000 tons of highly radioactive spent 
fuel from Swiss reactors to Russia during the next 30 years, up to 2030. Swiss 
officials stipulate that this nuclear waste will either remain in Russia and/or 
could be reprocessed in order to yield plutonium which would be returned to 
Switzerland while the nuclear waste generated by the reprocessing would remain 
in Russia.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Even if the fuel is not processed for plutonium extraction, the Swiss side 
requests that they be able to access Russian plutonium stocks equivalent to 
those contained in the Swiss fuel. Finally, the Swiss side requests that the 
Russian accept storage of up to 550 cubic meters of highly radioactive nuclear 
waste due to be returned to Switzerland from France and Britain between 1999 and 
2010 as part of plutonium reprocessing contracts signed between the Swiss 
utilities and the French state-controlled plutonium company COGEMA, and UK 
equivalent BNFL.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In recompense for these services, the Russian side, represented by the Deputy 
Director of Minatom, N. Yegorov, asks for undisclosed financial payments plus 
the opportunity to fabricate fresh uranium fuel for the Swiss nuclear reactors.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Following on the Russian sides statement that Russian Federation law must be 
&quot;...amended accordingly or special decisions are taken on a governmental 
level&quot;, it is agreed that &quot;The parties have come to an understanding 
that strict confidentiality must be ensured for the current and future 
negotiations, with respect for both the fact of such negotiations and the 
preliminary agreements reached by the Parties.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;An agreement containing these terms would be illegal under current 
Russian law, and the negotiating Parties even state this in their 
Protocol,&quot; said Sergey Tsyplenkov, Executive Director of Greenpeace Russia. 
&quot;We believe that the Russian Duma and the Government should intervene to 
stop these negotiations and take all steps necessary to ban waste dumping and 
further plutonium reprocessing in Russia.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is unimaginable that Swiss industry officials think that their 
nuclear waste should be dumped in Russia under a clandestine and illegal 
agreement&quot;, said Stefan Fueglister of Greenpeace Switzerland. &quot; The 
government and Swiss public must stop this immoral attempt to exploit Russian 
poverty and lack of regulatory control. The Swiss government must also stop 
these negotiations otherwise they would be permitting their nuclear materials to 
be transferred to facilities which are not under international safeguards regime 
and they would effectively be underwriting operations of secret, closed Russian 
facilities at which nuclear weapons materials continue to be produced.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">It would also appear that the negotiating Parties have sought to keep their 
talks secret from the US government which maintains non-proliferation controls 
over Swiss nuclear materials of US origin and/or which have been used in 
US-origin nuclear technologies.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Accordingly, under the US-Switzerland Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, the U.S. 
prohibits Switzerland from transferring nuclear materials to third parties 
without permission. Given that the US has sought to end plutonium reprocessing 
in Russia in order to guarantee nuclear non-proliferation, this agreement would 
appear in direct conflict with U.S. foreign policy and would not receive their 
permission.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Greenpeace has promised to campaign in Russia, Switzerland and the US in 
order to block the waste dumping/reprocessing agreement.</font> </P>
