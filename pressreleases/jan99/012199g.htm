        YORK - January 21 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Statement by Gloria Feldt<BR>President, Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America<BR><BR>In response to the Alan Guttmacher Institute report<BR><I>Sharing 
Responsibility: Women, Society and Abortion Worldwide</I><BR><BR>This report is a powerful 
reminder of the social and medical realities that existed in the U.S. before Roe 
v. Wade, and sadly still exist in many nations. It is also a powerful reminder 
of the consequences American women face if access to safe abortion is allowed to 
erode further.<BR><BR>The report provides persuasive evidence that banning 
abortion and blocking access to safe procedures does not stop women from trying 
to terminate pregnancies. It does inflict injury and death upon women. Legal 
abortion saves women's lives.<BR><BR>The ability to determine whether and when 
to become a mother is so central to women's lives that neither politicians nor 
religious leaders can decide this issue for us. As this report documents, 
unplanned pregnancy is common among women, young and old, married and single, 
all over the world. The right to choose birth control and abortion should have a 
central place in the spectrum of civil and human rights.<BR><BR>In many nations, 
access to contraception is very limited, so women have no means of preventing 
the need for abortion. Each year, roughly 78,000 women die of complications from 
unsafe, illegal abortions. Many more are injured. It is the moral responsibility 
of the community of nations to change the unjust laws and unwise health policies 
that cause this needless suffering, not just to women, but to their children and 
families.<BR><BR>For Americans, that moral responsibility starts with the U.S. 
Congress, which has turned its back on the reproductive health needs of women in 
poor nations, cutting funding for international family planning programs by 
one-third since 1995. This is unconscionable. Americans understand that family 
planning programs prevent unplanned pregnancy and prevent the need for abortion. 
But for too long, Congress has chosen to fight over abortion, rather than help 
women prevent the need for it. The new Congress must start making responsible 
choices and support family planning programs here and abroad.<BR><BR>On the 26th 
anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the legal right to choose in this nation may seem 
secure, but for too many Americans, lack of access to abortion is a serious 
problem. Snipers and bombers bent on terrorizing those who provide abortion 
services remain at large. The number of abortion providers continues to drop, 
making access to abortion harder and harder for rural women. Congress has banned 
Medicaid coverage for poor women who need abortion. U.S. servicewomen and 
military dependents are barred from having abortions in military hospitals, even 
if they are willing to pay for it themselves. For these women with no access to 
abortion, the right to choose is a nice concept, but not a 
reality.<BR><BR>Abortion was a health issue long before it was a political 
issue. It is time for Americans who remember the years and decades before Roe to 
start talking to their children about the aunts, grandmothers and 
great-grandmothers who died from illegal abortions. And it is time for the 
younger generation to ask older relatives about this, so they can learn what is 
at stake if we do not protect access to abortion. Decades ago, Americans knew 
from first-hand experience that legal abortion saves women's lives. Every new 
report of health data from around the world proves that all over 
again.</font>
