        - January 18 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">An analysis conducted by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, comparing the 
latest drop in crime rates among the states, provides compelling evidence that 
the gun lobby is wrong:  more concealed handguns do not mean less crime.  
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports, from 
1996 to 1997 the nation’s overall crime rate dropped 3.2%, from 5086.6 to 4922.7 
crimes per 100,000 population.  More telling, crime fell faster in states that 
have strict carrying concealed weapons (CCW) laws or that don’t allow the 
carrying of concealed weapons at all than in states which have lax CCW laws.  
This strongly suggests that, contrary to the arguments made by the National 
Rifle Association and others, states should not make it easier for citizens to 
carry concealed weapons in order to reduce crime.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the 29 states that have lax CCW laws (where law 
enforcement must issue CCW licenses to almost all applicants), the crime rate 
fell 2.1%, from 5397.0 to 5285.1 crimes per 100,000 population from 1996 to 
1997.  During the same time period, in the 21 states and the District of 
Columbia with strict carry laws or which don’t allow the carrying of concealed 
weapons at all, the crime rate fell 4.4%, from 4810.5 to 4599.9 crimes per 
100,000 population.  The decline in the crime rate of strict licensing and 
no-carry states was 2.1 times that of states with lax CCW systems, indicating 
that there are more effective ways to fight crime than to encourage more people 
to carry guns.  The research is particularly important for Missourians who face 
an April ballot initiative which would radically liberalize that state’s CCW 
system.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Furthermore, the rate of violent crime fell even 
faster in states with strict carry laws – falling 4.9% in restrictive states 
compared to 3.0% in lax states from 1996 to 1997.  While the rate of violent 
crime is higher in strict CCW states, a look at the violent crime rates over a 
five-year period provides even more evidence that we don’t need lax gun laws to 
reduce crime.  From 1992 to 1997, the violent crime rate in the strict and 
no-issue states fell 24.8% while the violent crime rate for the lax states 
dropped 11.4% (the national average is 19.4%).  New York and California -- the 
two most populous states and ones with strict CCW licensing laws -- experienced 
dramatic decreases in violent crime over the five-year period.  New York 
experienced a 38.6% decline and California experienced a 28.7% decline, both 
without putting more concealed handguns on their streets.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These numbers demonstrate what we’ve been 
saying all along,&quot; said Sarah Brady, chair of the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence and Handgun Control, Inc.  &quot;We don’t need to make it easier for 
just anyone to carry a gun nor do we need more concealed handguns on our 
streets to fight crime.  The way to fight crime is to punish criminals and to 
make sure that criminals don’t get guns in the first place.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Lax or &quot;shall issue&quot; CCW laws require 
law enforcement to issue CCW licenses to virtually anyone who is not a convicted 
felon.  In these states, local law enforcement has almost no discretion in 
issuing these licenses and, in many cases, getting a license requires little or 
no safety training or even a demonstration that the applicant knows how to use a 
gun.  States that give law enforcement discretion in issuing licenses (so-called 
&quot;may issue&quot; states) or which prohibit the carrying of concealed 
weapons entirely have chosen other strategies to fight crime, resulting in the 
greatest decreases in crime over the past five years.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For several years now, the National Rifle 
Association and others have made it a priority to get state legislatures to pass 
lax CCW laws.  They claim that putting more guns on our streets reduces crime, 
despite the fact that almost every major law enforcement organization in the 
country opposes lax CCW laws.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Common sense and practical experience 
dictate that more concealed handguns in the hands of untrained persons do not 
reduce crime,&quot; says Hazelwood, MO, Chief Carl R. Wolf, President-elect of 
the Missouri Police Chiefs Association. &quot;Law enforcement has known this 
simple fact for years, and that’s why leading state and national police groups 
have fought against the gun lobby’s national push for lax laws governing the 
carrying of concealed handguns by private citizens.  This study further debunks 
the myth perpetuated by the gun lobby.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On April 6, Missouri voters will vote on a 
state-wide referendum, sponsored by the NRA, that would allow virtually anyone 
to carry a loaded, concealed weapon almost anywhere in the state. Currently, 
Missouri does not allow the general public to carry concealed weapons outside of 
one’s private property.  From 1992 to 1997, Missouri enjoyed a 22% drop in its 
violent crime rate -- almost double the drop of the lax CCW states.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These numbers should make everyone question 
the NRA’s campaign for lax CCW laws under the guise of fighting crime,&quot; 
said Mrs. Brady.  &quot;If the gun lobby is truly interested in reducing crime, 
they should work for common sense measures like stopping criminals from getting 
guns at gun shows and limiting handgun sales to one per person per month to cut 
gun trafficking.  Working with lawmakers, law enforcement, the public health 
community and civic leaders on proven crime-fighting strategies, we can make 
America safer for everyone.&quot;</font> </P>

<P><EM><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah 
Brady, is the nation’s largest citizens’ gun control lobbying organization.  
Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns.  Founded in 1974, HCI has 
more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the 
country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws.  The Center to Prevent 
Handgun Violence, also chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1983 to reduce gun 
violence through education, legal advocacy, research, and outreach to the 
entertainment community.  CPHV’s national initiatives include prevention 
programs for parents and youth on the risks associated with guns, legal 
representation for gun violence victims, work with the entertainment community 
to encourage deglamorization of guns in the media, and research of the risks 
associated with guns and the efficacy of gun control laws.</font></EM></P></td>
