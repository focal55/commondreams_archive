        - January 11 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The killing of four detainees by the Indonesian Armed Forces in the province 
of Aceh is one more grim reminder, in a week of violence, of the unchecked power 
of the Indonesian military, Amnesty International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The deaths of the four men followed renewed violence in the troubled province 
of Aceh during the first week of January. Women and children are feared to be 
among people killed in military operations to capture those responsible for the 
murder of six soldiers and the abduction of one other in late December 1998.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;There were high hopes for human rights in Aceh last year after combat 
troops were withdrawn and the Head of the Armed Forces apologized for past 
violations,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;However, now it looks as though the small step forward has been 
countered by a leap back into the terror that characterized the last ten years 
in Aceh.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the Indonesian military, activities by the armed separatist 
group Aceh Merdeka have increased since the lifting of Aceh's status as a Area 
of Military Operation (DOM) in August 1998. The military has claimed that 
members of the group are behind the recent killings of soldiers and other 
protests in the province.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Of course those responsible for killing the soldiers should be brought 
to justice,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;But the actions of the 
military in the last week are clearly not about justice, but revenge.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since 3 January at least 11 people -- and according to some reports many more 
-- have been killed by the military in a series of separate incidents. An 
unknown number were killed when the security forces opened fire on a crowd 
marching towards the town of Lhokseumawe. Others died during military raids on 
villages around Lhokseumawe, where Aceh Merdeka members were suspected of 
hiding.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This disproportionate response to the deaths of the soldiers will only 
fan existing tensions,&quot; Amnesty International warned.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;However, there is still a window of opportunity left for the Habibie 
government to stop this cycle of violence and address the root causes of the 
grievances of the people of Aceh -- not least their need to know the truth and 
to be compensated for the horrific violations committed in the area during the 
early 1990s.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Thirty soldiers have already been arrested for the deaths of the four men and 
the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) have promised an investigation. Given the 
Habibie Government's poor record on investigating human rights violations and 
bringing the perpetrators to justice, Amnesty International is concerned that 
the incident will not be adequately investigated and that justice will not be 
done.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Aceh was classified as an Area of Military Operations 
(DOM) from 1990 to 1998 during counter-insurgency operations to crush Aceh
Merdeka. During that period serious human rights violations -- including extra judicial executions, &quot;disappearances&quot;, torture and arbitrary 
arrests -- were commonplace. The DOM was lifted in August 1998.</font> </P>
