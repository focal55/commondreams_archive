      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - January 27 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">By asserting an outdated and flawed
        defense of national sovereignty, the 
government of Chile is continuing to block the efforts to let a court of law 
decide on the guilt or innocence of Senator Augusto Pinochet, Amnesty 
International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 16 October 1998, after 25 years of struggle, victims of human rights 
violations in Chile were afforded a first glance at justice: Augusto Pinochet 
had been arrested. The former general's legal and public relations machinery 
moved quickly to claim immunity for him, and the matter is again before the 
United Kingdom's Law Lords.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This week, Augusto Pinochet's efforts to avoid a trial are being 
further supported by the intervention before the Law Lords of the Chilean 
government -- which instead of taking the side of the victims, has sided with 
the promotion of impunity,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The charges brought by the Government of Spain against Augusto Pinochet 
relate to well-known crimes, but more than a quarter century after they took 
place they still make very disturbing reading. Among other things, the former 
commander of the armed forces is charged with having -- jointly with others and 
in purported performance of official duties -- intentionally inflicted severe 
pain or suffering on:</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">- Marta Lidia Ugarte Roman, by suspending her from a pole in a pit; pulling 
out her finger nails and toe nails, and burning her;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">- Meduardo Paredes Barrientos, by systematically breaking his wrists, pelvis, 
ribs and skull; burning him with a blowtorch or flamethrower;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">- Adriana Luz Pino Vidal, a pregnant woman, by applying electric shocks to 
her vagina, ears, hands, feet and mouth, and stubbing out cigarettes on her 
stomach;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">- Antonio Llido Mengual, a priest born in Valencia, Spain, by applying 
electric current to his genitals and repeatedly beating his whole body;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Some forms of torture included the employment of a man with visible open 
syphilitic sores on his body, to rape female captives and to use on them a dog 
trained in sexual practices with human beings.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to Spain, the former general is also being sought by Switzerland, 
France and Belgium which have requested his extradition from the UK. Also, 
investigations have been initiated or legal complaints have been filed in 
Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg and Norway.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The argument that the current legal proceedings are an interference in 
Chile's internal affairs is contrary to long-settled rules of international law. 
Not only has Chile accepted as legally binding principles of international law 
that grant universal jurisdiction for certain crimes by ratifying the Convention 
against Torture, but it was precisely the inability of the relatives to get 
redress in their own country that led them to pursue legal proceedings in Spain.</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Chilean human rights organizations have strongly condemned the stance taken 
by the Chilean government. On 19 January, organizations representing relatives 
of some of the victims filed a writ for protection (&quot;recurso de 
protección&quot;) against President Frei, on the grounds that the decision to 
defend the argument that Augusto Pinochet should have immunity from prosecution 
&quot;constitutes a violation of national and international law.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The record of impunity in Chile is staggering. Although several cases of 
human rights violations have been brought to the courts, the majority of cases 
have been closed by the application of the 1978 Amnesty Law. The most famous 
case -- often cited as an example of justice being done in Chile -- is the 
conviction of General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza (Executive 
Director and Chief of Operations respectively of the National Intelligence 
Directorate, DINA) for the murder of former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier 
and US citizen Ronnie Moffit. This case, however, was specifically excluded from 
the amnesty law after pressure from the United States and other international 
pressure.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Impunity remains virtually total in Chile. The DINA is believed to have been 
implicated in around 2,000 cases of serious human rights violations. Since 1973, 
a total of approximately 5,000 judicial complaints of human rights violations 
have been presented in Chile, yet only 12 cases have led to prosecution (with 19 
former members of the security forces and armed forces having been found guilty 
as a result).</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the years, intergovernmental organizations have recommended that Chile 
takes measures to redress this situation, to no avail. Repeated calls by the UN 
Commission on Human Rights to the Chilean government to prosecute and punish 
those responsible for torture, &quot;disappearances&quot; and other human rights 
violations have remained ignored. So have recommendations made over many years 
by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Chilean government is at pains to stress that it is not defending 
Augusto Pinochet's human rights record. However, its current stance risk 
ensuring that such record would not be scrutinized in an independent and 
impartial tribunal,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite statements to the effect that Augusto Pinochet should be tried in 
Chile, the Chilean government has shown no intention of removing obstacles that 
make such trial currently impossible -- foremost among them the 1978 Amnesty 
Law.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Chile's current efforts before the Law Lords are in shameful 
contradiction with the country's expressed commitment to protect and promote 
human rights,&quot; Amnesty International concluded.</font></P>
