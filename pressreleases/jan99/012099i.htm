      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">FAIRBANKS,
        AK - January 20 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Greenpeace went to Superior Court in Fairbanks today to halt the illegal 
construction of British Petroleum's Northstar project, the first offshore oil 
project in the Arctic Ocean. BP is moving forward with the first part of the 
Northstar project without any of the permits required by federal and state law 
due to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources' improper 
&quot;go-ahead&quot;.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">BP started ice road construction as the first step in its two-year 
construction timetable, before it had the necessary permits. Ice roads are used 
to haul gravel six miles over the frozen Beaufort Sea from an onshore mine site 
near the Kuparuk River. The gravel will be placed in the Beaufort Sea to shore 
up the manmade Seal Island production facility.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Alaska Department of Natural Resources jumped the gun when it said 
BP could start ice road construction for the Northstar project, and BP knows 
it,&quot; said Melanie Duchin, Greenpeace Climate Issues Specialist in 
Anchorage. &quot;This project has been riddled with problems since its 
inception, and the fact that BP is trying to start construction before it has 
all of the required permits shows BP's lack of regard for public process and the 
environment. It is shameful that the Alaska Department of Resources has 
overturned the four-year cooperative agency review process and ignored laws 
designed to protect the public from adverse impacts from this project, simply to 
meet BP's timetable&quot; said Duchin.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">BP's Northstar project will be the first project of its kind to use a subsea 
pipeline for transporting oil from an offshore artificial island to the Trans 
Alaska Pipeline. The project has been in the works for over four years, and has 
been subject to numerous delays due to the unproven and dangerous nature of 
subsea technology in the Arctic. A seven-volume Draft Environmental Impact 
Statement (DEIS) was released last June and revealed substantial flaws, 
particularly with respect to the inability to clean up oil spills and the 
cumulative impacts of Northstar to the Arctic marine ecosystem. The DEIS 
revealed that there is a one in four chance of a large oil spill at some point 
in the 15-year lifetime of the project. Cleaning up an oil spill in Arctic 
conditions is next to impossible, especially in broken ice conditions during 
spring and fall.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;BP has shown time and again that it will do just about anything to get 
Northstar built and pumping oil, and in this case, it has shown a blatant 
disregard for the law and public process,&quot; said Duchin. &quot;If BP truly 
cared about Alaska, it would cancel the ill-planned Northstar project and 
redirect its resources to plan a transition away from an oil-based economy. This 
would not only protect the environment, it would also provide a more stable 
economy and jobs for the State and for Alaskans, without the threat of layoffs 
and budget deficits when oil prices take a nose dive. Halting ice road 
construction is the only responsible step toward showing a regard for the law, 
the environment and the people of Alaska.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Greenpeace is campaigning to halt oil exploration in new oil frontiers such 
as the Alaskan Arctic and the Northeast Atlantic oceans as the first step toward 
phasing out fossil fuels and phasing in renewable forms of energy such as solar 
and wind.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Greenpeace is the leading independent organization that uses peaceful and 
creative activism to protect the global environment.</font>
