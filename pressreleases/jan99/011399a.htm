      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">BEREA,
        KY - January 13 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The U.S. Army's failure to comply with official government directives for 
dealing with potential Year 2000 computer problems at its chemical weapons 
incinerators, documented in a recent Pentagon Inspector General (IG) report, is 
&quot;another example of the Army making image a higher priority than public 
safety, &quot; according to critics of the incineration program.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the December 24, 1998 IG Report, the Army's Program Manager for 
Chemical Demilitarization (PMCD), &quot;...failed to prepare the necessary Year 
2000 documentation and has no contingency plans, risk management plans, system 
validation plan or schedule in place [to become compliant].&quot; In addition, 
the IG Report raises serious questions surrounding PMCD's reports to the 
Pentagon on critical systems at their chemical weapons incinerators on Johnston 
Atoll in the Pacific and at Tooele, Utah.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The IG states that PMCD, &quot;...did not make timely progress in assessing 
information...did not prepare the necessary year 2000 documentation 
and...incorrectly reported the JACADS [Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal 
System] subsystem status [to DoD].&quot; Two subsystems identified as 
incorrectly reported--the control room communications system and the chemical 
agent monitoring system--are critical to the operation of the facility. The 
communications system records alarms, identifies problems with the plant alarm 
system, and monitors information related to mechanical function and furnace 
pressure and temperature. The chemical agent monitoring system detects the 
presence of nerve agent in the incinerators' smokestacks and in the facility 
generally. Concerning the monitoring system, the Report states, &quot;The Y2K 
planning and execution stages are only in the initial phases...the program 
manager still has not determined if the [monitoring system] is Y2K compliant and 
will impact other interface systems.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Federal Law PL 105-271, &quot;Military Departments must provide 
plans for Y2K -related end-to-end testing of their respective functional process 
by November 1, 1998.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">An article in the January 11, 1999 issue of<I> Federal Computer Week 
</I>stated, &quot;The fixes [at Tooele, Utah] have been delayed until the end of 
October 1999 because the Army does not want to interfere with ongoing disposal 
operations at the facility.&quot; And according to the IG, &quot;The Army did 
not begin to assess the JACADS until the summer of 1998 because of other 
priorities such as the renewal of the EPA permit.&quot; The IG concludes that, 
&quot;As a result, the Army may not be able to implement corrections before the 
turn of the century, thus increasing risk of mission impairment.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Chemical Weapons Working Group spokesperson, Craig Williams said, &quot;The 
Army's incineration program continues to give the highest priority to the amount 
of chemical agent burned even if it means disobeying Pentagon directives and 
federal law. It appears Army officials are even willing to submit erroneous 
reports if it will allow them to continue operating.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The IG Report also blasts PMCD's lack of oversight of the problem saying, 
&quot;The Army PMCD did not provide oversight at JACADS, ... did not visit
JACADS, ... did not verify the progress reported to DOD and did not take 
appropriate oversight action to ensure that reporting was accurate and that 
documentation was available...&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Williams said, &quot;PMCD will defend its negligence by saying that the 
disposal schedule is all important because of the risk of continued storage of 
the weapons. However, the Army may be forcing longer storage of these weapons if 
the Y2K problems shut down operations next year. It's obvious Army officials are 
more concerned with being able to tell Congress how many pounds of material 
they've burned than in mitigating risk. Image has always been the Army's number 
one priority.&quot;</font></P>
