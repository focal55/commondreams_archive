      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - January 27 - </font>Following is a statement by Robert W. Tiller, director of security programs, 
Physicians for Social Responsibility:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">It is disheartening to see Ballistic Missile Defense
(BMD) again at the 
forefront of discussions about U.S. national security policy. Republicans 
have been leading the revival of the ineffective and costly Star Wars 
missile defense program and now even President Clinton is jumping on the BMD 
bandwagon. New fears over possible nuclear attack by countries such as North 
Korea or Iraq are fueling the surge in interest in BMD and the President has 
responded by calling for renewed efforts to build a missile defense system.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">But unfortunately the BMD endeavor will not work. It is plagued
with 
technological failures, a bloated budget and questions about its very 
effectiveness. Additionally, the BMD program encourages other countries to 
pursue their own missile defense programs.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>No Credible Threat </b> <BR>There is currently no credible threat to the United 
States that missile defense will address. Only Russia, China, France and 
Great Britain have long-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting the United States, and they are U.S. allies. The World Trade Center,
Oklahoma City and American Embassy bombings in recent years illustrate 
the fact that the most serious current threat to the United States is from 
terrorist attacks, which cannot be prevented by ballistic missile defense. 
Even a working Star Wars system would not stop terrorists from smuggling 
nuclear weapons via plane, truck, train or ship. Moreover, promoting a BMD 
system will strain relations with Russia and make it less likely that we can 
convince them to reduce their arsenals. This point was clearly evident this week as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attempted to assuage
Russian concerns over this issue.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Exorbitant Costs</b> <BR>After over 40 years of research, and more than $100 
billion expended since Star Wars was conceived in the early 1950s, there is still no defense system that actually works reliably. In early
January 
1999, the Clinton administration announced a plan to pledge $6.6 billion 
over six years to build a limited missile defense system. Congress 
appropriated $1 billion more for ballistic missile defense in fiscal year 
1999 than the $3.6 billion requested by the Administration, even though 
senior Pentagon officials advised against it. Why do we continue to pour 
money into a program that has already cost taxpayers a fortune without any 
tangible results?</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Technological Problems </b> <BR>The money lavished on missile defense is 
especially egregious in light of the fact that military experts know that 
the technology is far from ready. In a 1998 report released by the Ballistic 
Missile Defense Organization, which oversees the BMD program, retired Gen. Larry Welch warned that the national missile defense program was
&quot;highly unlikely&quot; to succeed because it lacks coherence and a realistic plan. The Welch panel reported that out of the 14 tests
directed against high-altitude targets, only two, or 14 percent, hit their targets. Even if it were possible to produce an effective
missile 
defense, it would still not protect the U.S. from attack by nuclear weapons 
carried on cruise missiles. Furthermore, if an enemy launched 
&quot;dummy&quot; missiles not carrying any warheads, the missile defense 
interceptors would be wasted in destroying the dummies, leaving the United 
States with no defense against a second wave of missiles that do have 
warheads.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Proliferation Risks and Global Impac</b>t <BR>The U.S. effort to create a working 
missile defense system, violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. 
For almost three decades the ABM Treaty -- which limits development, testing 
and deployment of missile defense systems -- has been the cornerstone of stable relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and
continues to be vital to U.S.-Russian relations today. Strong U.S.-Russian ties are in many ways dependent on the ABM Treaty, and
moves to abrogate the treaty could have serious repercussions.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>A Better Approach</b><br>
Hardline conservatives have kept missile defense alive, 
even though it does not serve U.S. interests. Now even President Clinton has succumbed to political pressure to move forward with this bad
idea. 
Rather than step up its militarization, the U.S. should strive to improve 
its diplomatic relations with allies and perceived enemies. It is far better 
to prevent the launch of missiles than to attempt to intercept them in the 
air. Instead of pumping more money into a shaky ballistic missile defense, 
the President should pursue measures to reduce the U.S. and Russian arsenals 
and lower the alert status of the thousands of nuclear weapons poised on hair trigger
alert.</font>
