    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
      - January 5 - </font>The Clinton Administration is misguided in its decision to accept the new conventional wisdom that the military "readiness
      crisis" is the result of a defense budget which has been cut too deeply. While there are indeed some readiness shortfalls, they are by no means
      severe enough to justify increasing the $279 billion military budget.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The President announced on Saturday that he has decided to add $12 billion
to the Pentagon budget in fiscal 2000 and about $110 over six years.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Responsibility for readiness shortfalls  lies with both Congress and  the
Pentagon. Many of the congressional advocates of increased military spending have undermined their case by championing military pork -- as much as $5
billion alone in fiscal 1999. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich helped to foist on the Pentagon many unwanted C-130 cargo planes made near his district.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott won initial funding for an unrequested $1.5 billion helicopter carrier to be made in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The
$8.3 billion for defense in the Omnibus Appropriations Bill was larded with pork projects for the select few Members who drafted the bill. While Members
of both party cry readiness, they are in reality seeking additional pork to pump into their districts and states.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">But the Pentagon is not absolved either.  It continues to prepare to fight
two wars simultaneously.  However, the December 1997 National Defense Panel argued that the two war concept "may have become a force-protection
mechanism -- a means of justifying the current force structure." Current force levels, especially our nuclear forces, are still tailored to counter
the now defunct Soviet threat.  The Pentagon continues to build new weapons that were designed during the Cold War to confront the Soviet Union and are
too expensive and contain super-sophisticated technology not needed to deal with current potential and real foes.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">It is true that military spending has declined, but it is still at 82
percent of Cold War levels. A well-budgeted $279 billion should be more than adequate to contain an Iraq which spends less than $2 billion per year and a
North Korea which spends about $5 billion annually (compared to a South Korea's $15 billion).</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While additional funds are in fact needed for soldiers pay increases and to
meet some readiness shortfalls, there are other options within the Pentagon budget to obtain the funds:</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Divert the $5 billion in pork spending that Members of Congress insisted
on in 1998 alone.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Abandon the requirement to prepare for two major wars almost
simultaneously.  The threats facing the United States in the future are not the same as those of the Cold War and, in the long-term, U.S. defense
strategy should not be based on an outdated strategy.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Eliminate Cold War weapons, including at least one of the three new
tactical aircraft programs and the New Attack Submarine.  No hostile country has the
industrial base to build a fleet of tactical fighters to rival the current U.S. arsenal of F-15s, F-16s and F-18s.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Reduce the U.S. nuclear weapons force to the START III level of 2,500 or
below whether or not the Russians approve START II and START III, at a Congressional Budget Office estimated savings of about $1.5 billion per
year.  The current level of spending on nuclear weapons is the result of Cold War competition with Russia. However, financial constraints will force
the Russians to those levels and below whether or not they ratify arms control agreements.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Cut force levels.  Between active duty (1,396,000), reserve (877,000) and
Pentagon civilians (747,000), the Pentagon still has over three million personnel. A reduction of 200,000 active duty personnel will bring about
large savings.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">6. Implement base closings more rapidly; close more bases.  Reductions in
military infrastructure have not kept pace with reductions in personnel and procurement since the end of the Cold War.</font></P>
