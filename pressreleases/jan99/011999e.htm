        - January 19 - </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance 
reform bill this year.&quot; <BR>-- President Clinton, State of the Union, 1993.</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I also must now call on you to finish the job both Houses began last 
year, by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform 
legislation this year.&quot;<BR>-- President Clinton, State of the Union, 1994.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the 
cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PACs. This year, lets give the 
folks at home something to cheer about.&quot; <BR>-- President Clinton, State of 
the Union, 1995.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Now I challenge Congress to go further -- to curb special-interest 
influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign reform bill 
in a generation.&quot; <BR>-- President Clinton, State of the Union, 1996.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Let's work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into 
law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy 
-- July the Fourth.&quot;<BR>-- President Clinton, State of the Union, 1997.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This year, by March 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on 
bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. 
Let's be clear: A vote against McCain and Feingold is a vote for soft money and 
for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign 
finance reform this year.&quot;<BR>-- President Clinton, State of the Union, 
1998</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON -- While President Clinton will undoubtedly use tonight's State of 
the Union address to make another plea for campaign finance reform, he can leave 
a lasting legacy of his presidency by backing up those words with swift action 
and pass comprehensive campaign finance reform, Ellen Miller, Executive Director 
of Public Campaign, said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The president's propensity for raising millions of dollars from wealthy 
special interests speaks volumes about his commitment to meaningful campaign 
finance reform,&quot; Miller said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;But a presidency that has prided itself on empowering all Americans, 
rewarding good ideas and building trust in government should be able to deliver 
to the people a system of campaign funding which delivers our democracy to all 
people of this nation,&quot; Miller said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The president and the presidency are seen as part of the problems plaguing 
our campaign finance system. Without a dramatic move on campaign finance reform, 
President Clinton's legacy on campaign finance reform will be tainted by 
allegations of illegalities and infusions of campaign cash from wealthy special 
interests. On the other hand, taking bold action on campaign finance reform will 
not only restore the American people's faith in our democracy, but mark this 
president as a bold reformer who heeds the wishes of the people he was twice 
elected to represent.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In eight statewide polls conducted by The Mellman Group for Public Campaign 
this past August, public support for the McCain-Feingold bill garnered strong 
majorities across the board, ranging from 75 percent to 58 percent. In addition, 
support for more comprehensive Clean Money Campaign Reform was as strong or 
stronger, ranging from 74 percent to 60 percent. Clearly, people nationwide want 
to see a change in the way we finance our election campaigns.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While piecemeal reforms may take us in the right direction, meaningful 
campaign finance reform must be about offering an alternative to the current 
system which is fueled by lots of cash from a few wealthy special interests.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During the November elections, Arizona and Massachusetts voters passed Clean 
Money Campaign Reform which allows candidates to voluntarily choose to take no 
private money, limit their spending and fund their campaigns through a publicly 
funded Clean Elections fund. Arizona and Massachusetts join Maine and Vermont in 
passing this kind of comprehensive reform, demonstrating that while Congress and 
the President may dither on campaign finance reform, people are outraged enough 
to take matters into their own hands.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Public Campaign is a non-profit, non-partisan organization working on behalf 
of comprehensive campaign finance reform.</font>
