        - January 21 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The United States could increase the share of electricity generated from 
renewable sources (wind, solar, plants and geothermal) to about 10 times current 
levels over the next 20 years, and still see a 13 percent decrease in 
electricity prices, according to a new study by the Union of Concerned 
Scientists. Expanding renewable electricity use to these levels would freeze 
power plant emissions of carbon dioxide--the primary cause of global warming--at 
about year 2000 levels, making a major contribution to meeting the US reduction 
targets under the Kyoto global warming treaty.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">With the nation moving to rewrite rules for the way electricity is produced 
and sold, Congress introduced six electricity deregulation bills in 1998 that 
would ensure continued growth of renewable electricity generation. The UCS 
report, <I>A Powerful Opportunity: Making Renewable Electricity the 
Standard</I>, is the most comprehensive examination of the costs and benefits of 
these federal proposals to date. The report highlights a comparison between a 
strong proposal by Senator James Jeffords (R-Vt.), which would increase 
renewables to 20 percent of electricity generation by 2020, and a weaker 
proposal by the Clinton Administration, which would result in a share of 5.5 
percent by 2010.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Congress has a powerful opportunity to clean up America's electricity 
by making renewable energy the standard,&quot; said Steve Clemmer, Senior Energy 
Analyst at UCS and lead author of the report. &quot;Our report shows that even 
the strongest proposals in Congress are very affordable and will make major 
strides in improving the environment.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the next 20 years electricity costs are expected to fall as expensive 
existing power plants are replaced with cheaper and more efficient ones. UCS 
found that under every federal proposal to increase renewables, electricity 
bills would still be lower than today's bills. The proposals would dedicate a 
fraction of those savings to develop clean new technologies, while reducing air 
pollution and the threat of global warming. For example, under the Jeffords 
proposal, a typical household's average monthly electricity bill would decline 
from $40 today to $35.47 in 2020. That's only $1.33 less in monthly savings than 
if we continue our current over-reliance on dirty power plants.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Federal proposals to deregulate the electricity industry would repeal 
current laws that support renewable energy,&quot; said Alan Nogee, UCS Energy 
Program Director. &quot;Yet, poll after poll has shown that Americans want more 
renewable energy. It is critical that a deregulated electricity market allow a 
new generation of clean energy technologies to compete.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A companion report also released today, <I>Powerful Solutions: 7 Ways to 
Switch America to Renewable Electricity</I> shows that eight states have already 
adopted minimum renewable energy requirements. Seven states have also adopted 
new renewable energy funds, totaling about $1 billion over the next 10 years. 
Based on California's experience, these funds will likely leverage an additional 
$2 billion in private investment. Together, these state initiatives will likely 
provide enough renewable electricity over the next 10 years to power 4 million 
homes.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;States as diverse as Connecticut, Iowa, Arizona, and California have 
demonstrated national leadership in developing new renewable technologies that 
can clean up the environment, create jobs, and increase our fuel diversity and 
energy independence,&quot; said Nogee.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Many studies have shown that renewables would create more jobs and income 
than investments in coal and natural gas power plants. For example, a Wisconsin 
report found that renewables could provide six percent of the state's 
electricity and add 3,300 new jobs, $81 million in disposable income, and $165 
million in gross state product.</font></P>
