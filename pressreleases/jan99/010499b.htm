In the aftermath of civilian deaths during military operations in Aceh on 
Sunday, Human Rights Watch today urged all parties involved in the conflict 
there to respect basic principles of humanitarian law banning torture and extra judicial executions. The operations followed a December 29 attack on a 
public bus carrying soldiers, in which a mob dragged eighteen soldiers

operations in Aceh
on Sunday, Human Rights Watch today urged all parties involved in the conflict 
there to respect basic principles of humanitarian law banning torture and extra judicial executions. The operations followed a December 29 attack on a 
public bus carrying soldiers, in which a mob dragged eighteen soldiers off and 
killed seven of them.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch appealed to the Indonesian government not to turn the 
troubled region back into a special zone for counterinsurgency operations and 
urged it to put together a concrete plan for addressing past human rights 
violations in Aceh. The New York-based organization also urged Jakarta-based 
embassies to coordinate among themselves and immediately send a joint diplomatic 
team to Aceh to meet with as broad a range of individuals and organizations as 
possible, including nongovernmental organizations, academics and students, 
influential community leaders, and religious leaders as well as officials at the 
district, sub district and village levels. The visit could be an important means 
of exploring possible solutions to an escalating crisis.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch's appeal came after a series of violent incidents in East 
and North Aceh in recent weeks that the army has blamed on the guerrilla 
organization called Aceh Merdeka (the Free Aceh Movement). They have accused one 
man in particular, Ahmad Kandang, of being the mastermind. Kandang was deported 
from Malaysia last year and has been active in organizing pro-independence 
activities ever since. The local press has reported widespread belief among the 
Acehnese more generally that some of the incidents have been provoked by 
elements within the military itself in the interests of maintaining a large 
troop presence in Aceh, an accusation the army vigorously denies.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">But an important factor in the violence is the resentment now boiling over in 
Aceh at the Habibie government's failure to take concrete steps toward 
investigating and prosecuting those responsible for massive and systematic human 
rights abuses during the eight-year period (1990-98) that Aceh was formally a 
&quot;military operations region.&quot; That status, imposed when major 
counterinsurgency operations against Aceh Merdeka got underway, was only lifted 
on August 7, 1998. The two districts, East and North Aceh, where the recent 
violence has taken place, were a particular target of those operations in which 
thousands of civilians were killed or disappeared, and many more arbitrarily 
arrested. Expectations that the Habibie government would address the abuses of 
the past were high following the resignation of President Soeharto in May 1998, 
but they have gradually been replaced by anger over lack of any serious action.</font> 
<P><B><font size="2" face="Arial">Background to the Violence</font></B> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This cycle of violence really began in Lhokseumawe on August 31, when a crowd 
began throwing rocks at 659 troops being pulled out of Aceh as part of the 
formal ending of the region's special military status. The incident sparked off 
several days of rioting in which two youths were killed and 300 offices and 
shops in Lhokseumawe and surrounding towns were burned or seriously damaged. The 
army said at the time that someone was using a megaphone to shout &quot;Long 
live Aceh Merdeka&quot;.as the rioting took place; press reports carried stories 
of local people accusing a sergeant from the sub district military command in 
Bayu as being the &quot;brains&quot; behind the rioting. The army denied the 
accusation.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The most recent incidents of violence include the following:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On Sunday, January 3, nine people, including a young woman, were reported 
killed as military operations were taking place in the villages of Kandang,
Paloh, and Pusong in Muara Dua sub district as well as in the villages of Buluh 
Blang Ara and Simpang Kramat in Kuta Makmur sub district. According to press 
reports in the Jakarta daily Kompas (January 3, 1998), the military operations 
were aimed at finding two soldiers taken hostage on December 30. According to 
the army, their captors belonged to Aceh Merdeka. Army sources said that one of 
those killed was carrying an AK-47 rifle, but who opened fire and under what 
circumstances remains unclear. Six of those killed were pronounced dead at the 
main hospital in the city of Lhokseumawe on Sunday. Another victim was 
reportedly buried immediately by family members, and two other bodies were 
brought to the hospital on Monday. In the aftermath of the shootings, a post 
office, tax office, and sub district administrative office in Lhokseumawe were 
set on fire by angry crowds.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On December 29, seven soldiers were killed in the village of Lhok
Nibong, 
East Aceh by a mob that the army says was led by Aceh Merdeka. The attack took 
place after a public bus carrying military personnel returning from leave was 
stopped by a crowd of people in what is locally called a &quot;sweeping&quot; -- 
a check of identity cards. Those with military i.d.s were dragged off the bus. 
According to one account, a trader from Lhokseumawe was stopped in his car by 
men armed with knives and was forced to take five corpses to the Arakundoe 
river, where the armed men tossed the bodies in. Three of the stabbed and beaten 
bodies were recovered on December 31; a fourth was found on January 4. A report 
in the Aceh daily, Serambi Indonesia (January 2, 1998) said that an eyewitness 
had seen another car with two badly beaten soldiers in it, then still alive, 
being driven toward the Jambo Aye dam. The two men are also believed to have 
been killed, although their bodies have not been found. The army said the attack 
was the work of Ahmad Kandang. Local activists said that the bodies of four of 
the seven soldiers had been displayed in exactly the same way that the military 
itself had displayed the bodies of four civilians it killed in 1991, including 
by hanging one from a tree. Of fourteen people taken into custody by the 
military in connection with the attack, twelve were reported to have been from 
North Aceh, i.e. they were not local people.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On December 20, a mob estimated at 1,000 people attacked the
sub district 
military post in Bayu, North Aceh -- the same post that figured in the August 
31-September 2 violence -- after a sergeant there was accused of having molested 
a married woman on her way home from tarawih prayers, a form of worship that 
takes place in the evening during the fasting month of Ramadan. The army said 
that even the woman's husband admitted she was mentally disturbed, and that the 
sergeant in question had tried to take her home after she came on her own to the 
subdistrict command threatening to commit suicide. When the rumor spread that 
she had been molested by the sergeant, a group of youths tried to attack the 
military command. The military said it fired warning shots and called in 
reinforcements from Lhokseumawe. The new troops tried to evacuate the sergeant 
from the command for his own protection, according to an account in the December 
21, 1998 edition of Serambi Indonesia, but the mob surrounded the vehicle they 
intended to use, so the army opened fire. Two civilians were wounded, both 
apparently by rubber bullets. A new mob arrived at the military command about an 
hour later from the village of Simpang Kandang, but were forced back by army 
fire. On the way back, in Alue Awe village in the Blang Mangat sub district, the 
crowd attacked an army major and his wife, traveling home to Aceh from Medan in 
their private car. Both were seriously injured. The major's firearm was taken, 
and the car was burned. Three other men in army fatigues were reportedly stopped 
at a crowd-operated checkpoint in Simpang Cunda. They too were beaten up and 
relieved of their weapons, and their car was also burned..</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If Aceh Merdeka fighters had a hand in the torture and execution of the 
soldiers in Lhok Nibong, then they have committed a major violation of 
international humanitarian law. Clearly any civilians who took part are also 
responsible for serious crimes and must be punished accordingly. But the depth 
of local sentiment against the military shows the urgent need for investigation 
and prosecution of past abuses. Only if the military is held accountable, and is 
seen to be held accountable, for those abuses, is the cycle of violence likely 
to end. </font> </P>
