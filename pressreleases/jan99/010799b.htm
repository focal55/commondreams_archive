        YORK
        - January 7 - </font>
Newly obtained official data confirm the need for reform of New York's drug 
laws, Human Rights Watch said today. Nearly 80% of the drug offenders who 
received prison sentences in 1997 had never been convicted of a violent felony 
and almost half had never even been arrested for a violent crime. One in four 
drug offenders in prison was convicted of simple possession, primarily of minute quantities.
        </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
These and other figures prepared by the New York State Division of Criminal 
Justice Services (DCJS) and the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) in 
response to a request from Human Rights Watch reveal that few convicted drug 
offenders are dangerous criminals.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;New York's drug laws are among the country's harshest,&quot; said 
Jamie Fellner, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch. &quot;Not only do they 
waste public resources, but they also violate basic notions of justice by 
putting minor nonviolent offenders behind bars.&quot; Human Rights Watch's 
research suggests that most drug offenders in the criminal justice system are 
street-level sellers caught in &quot;buy and bust&quot; operations staged by the 
police, addicted individuals supporting their habit through low-level positions 
in the drug trade, &quot;mules&quot; who carried drugs owned by someone else, 
and drug dealers' girlfriends and wives.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some supporters of New York's drug laws have argued that most drug 
offenders are violent criminals. The new DCJS data contradict such claims. That 
data also indicate that many of the drug offenders sentenced to prison are first 
offenders. One in three had never even been previously arrested for a drug 
felony, and half had never been convicted of one.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the DCJS analysis of the prior history of the 10,047 men and 
women sentenced to prison for drug offenses in 1997:<br>
        </font>
        <ul>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">77.5% had no prior violent felony convictions.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">47.6% had no prior arrests for a violent felony.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">50.9% had no prior drug felony convictions.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">33.3% had no prior drug felony arrests.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Of those who had been previously convicted of a drug felony, 89% were 
convicted of the lowest categories of drug crimes (class C, D or E). <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">31.8% had no prior felony convictions for any crime.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">17.2% had never been arrested for any felony.<BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Only 9.7% had prior convictions for both drug and violent felonies.</font></LI>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Under 
laws passed a quarter of a century ago during the administration of Governor 
Nelson Rockefeller, even minor drug offenders face mandatory prison terms. 
Judges cannot set fair sentences tailored to the conduct and culpability of each 
defendant and the danger they pose to society. The law permits no distinction 
between a person who makes a one-time delivery of drugs for a small fee and a 
major trafficker. And the sentences are extreme: a person convicted of one sale 
of two ounces of cocaine receives the same prison term as a murderer or 
rapist—at least fifteen years to life. Many addicts who could be helped with 
drug treatment are warehoused instead in prison—usually upstate and far from 
their families and communities.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Thousands of drug offenders have ended up in prison as a result of these 
laws. Few are significant traffickers. According to the Department of 
Correctional Services, there were 22,407 drug offenders under custody as of 
September 1, 1998. Twenty-five percent of them were convicted of simple drug 
possession. Sixty percent were convicted of the three lowest felonies—Class C, 
D, or E—which involve only minute drug amounts. For example, only a one-half 
gram of cocaine is required for conviction of Class D felony possession—and 
1,242 people are in prison for that offense.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The DCS analysis also reveals that one in five of the drug offenders 
under its custody—4,450 people—had no prior felony convictions. Another 7,501 
had only one prior conviction. That is, more than half (53.4%) of the drug 
offenders in prison had one or no prior convictions.</font></p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Because of the severe and rigid sentencing scheme mandated by the drug 
laws, low-level drug offenders face years in prison. According to the DCS 
analysis of the sentences of the total population of drug offenders under its 
custody, the average maximum sentence for first felony offenders convicted of a 
Class B felony is 87.6 months, 68.1 months for a Class C felony, 56.5 months for 
a Class D felony, and 42.4 months for a Class E felony. Even if an offender does 
not serve the maximum period behind bars, his or her liberty remains conditional 
until the maximum period is completed.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch recognizes stiff prison sentences can be appropriate 
for addressing violent crime and protecting communities. But such sentences are 
misguided and destructive when it comes to nonviolent drug offenders. Indeed, as 
documented in &quot;Cruel and Usual: Disproportionate Sentences for New York 
Drug Offenders,&quot; a Human Rights Watch report released last year, New York's 
drug laws violate fundamental principles of justice by yielding 
disproportionately harsh sentences all too frequently.</font></p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Copies of the data produced by DCJS and DCS are available from Human 
Rights Watch by calling 212-216-1808.</font>
