        - January 14 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Unless immediate action is taken to protect them, two prominent Afghan 
personalities living as refugees in Pakistan could be killed for their 
activities in support of peace and human rights in Afghanistan, Amnesty 
International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Fatana Gailani, head of the Afghan Women Council, and her husband, 
Ishaq Gailani, a prominent Afghan politician, have been living under continuous 
death threats in recent years, but in the light of recent attacks there are 
clear signs that their lives are at risk.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Pakistani authorities do not seem to have taken effective and 
adequate measures to protect them or to investigate past attacks -- including 
targeted killings,&quot;Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Fatana and Ishaq Gailani's names have appeared in a hit list which began 
circulating in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan in mid-1998. So far 
at least four people named in that list have been assassinated and one has been 
seriously injured.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The political links of the killers are not clearly known, but all of those 
targeted are prominent Afghan personalities actively opposed to Taleban policies 
in Afghanistan, mostly from Pashtun ethnic background.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Taleban movement has denied responsibility for these attacks. However, in 
some cases, individuals claiming to represent the Taleban have delivered the 
warnings in person, seeking an end to what they have termed as 
&quot;anti-Taleban activity&quot;.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The government of Pakistan should provide efficient and adequate 
protection to Fatana and Ishaq Gailani, and ensure that no Afghans in Pakistan 
become the target of death threats or assassination,&quot; Amnesty International 
urged. &quot;These threats fit a pattern of harassment of refugee leaders over 
many years by Afghanistan's many warring factions.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization is also calling upon the Taleban to declare
unequivocally 
that they are opposed to such assassinations and to make sure that Taleban 
members do no threaten the life or physical integrity of Afghan civilians.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Ishaq Gailani has confined himself to his house since 
last October when he noticed armed Afghan men continually following his car in 
Peshawar. His local guard, who was traveling with him, got out of the car to 
assess the situation and saw four armed men, all of whom were known to Ishaq
Gailani. The armed men fled when they realized they had been detected. Since 
that incident, Ishaq Gailani has been unable to carry out his functions as the 
head of the Council for Understanding and Cooperation in Afghanistan, a 
gathering of Afghan intellectuals in Pakistan seeking a political solution to 
the armed conflict in Afghanistan. He resigned from his post two weeks ago.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Fatana Gailani also lives in constant fear. About two months ago, as she was 
leaving her office in Hyatabad area of Peshawar, her driver noticed three armed 
Afghan men in a car waiting at the corner of the street. They alerted the local 
police who arrested the men. However, they were released at the police station 
and no real investigation of the incident has been carried out.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">An alarming number of attacks on Afghans have been taking place in Pakistan 
over the past few months. Pakistani authorities are reported not to have taken 
serious measures to investigate these attacks.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In January this year, there have been at least two politically motivated 
attacks against Afghans known for their opposition to the Taleban policies.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 27 December, the Revolutionary Association of Women of Afghanistan
(RANWA) 
postponed their scheduled demonstration against the Taleban policies towards 
women in Afghanistan. Pakistani newspaper, the Frontier Post reported:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A person identifying himself as a spokesman of Taleban called at the 
office of The Frontier Post in the afternoon, threatening that they would break 
the legs of RAWA participants if they took out a protest demonstration. He said 
that they had already informed the IGP (Inspector General of Police) about their 
decision and he would be responsible for any eventuality in case the RAWA took 
out a procession.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;He added that they did not allow the females to come out from their 
houses in Afghanistan, then how could they allow them to take to roads here in 
Pakistan. He added that the processions by the females was against the spirit of 
Islam.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">When he was asked as to why they have been trying to implement the laws of 
Afghanistan in Pakistan, he replied that their laws are applicable to all the 
Afghans irrespective of their place of livings.&quot; [sic]</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 27 November, Ata Mohammad Sarkatib, known for his political opposition to 
the Taleban policies, was attacked by gunmen. He was seriously wounded when 
several armed men reportedly forced their way into his house. One person 
reportedly arrested in connection with this case has reportedly claimed he was 
hired by the Taleban. The Taleban authorities have denied any links.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">General Shirin Agha, another leading member of Da Solh Ghorzan (peace 
movement party), was shot dead in Peshawar by two men on 25 November.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 9 November Dagarwal Latif was killed in Quetta by gunmen on a motor bike. 
His killing appears to be connected to his support of a political solution to 
the conflict in Afghanistan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In early November Hashim Paktyanie, a prominent journalist advocating a 
representative parliamentary system of government in Afghanistan, was killed by 
gunmen as he left his house in Peshawar. He had been granted asylum in Sweden 
shortly before his death.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In July 1998, Nazar Mohammad, a prominent Afghan politician, was assassinated 
in Peshawar by two men who shot him dead in his shop with a pistol and fled on a 
motor bike.</font> </P>
