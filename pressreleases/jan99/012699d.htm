        YORK
        - January 26 - </font>Was the 2,000-pound bomb that U.S. warplanes dropped on a residential
        neighborhood in Iraq's second largest city on January 25 an "accident" or did the Pentagon deliberately target civilians?</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"The U.S. has deliberately targeted Iraqi civilians in the past,"
stated Brian Becker, co-director of the International Action Center (IAC). "During the Gulf war, for instance, the U.S. used two
precision or `smart' bombs to destroy the Al-Amariyah bomb shelter in downtown Baghdad. As many as 1,100 Iraqi children were killed. The
Pentagon spokesman went on TV in Feb. 1991 to announce that the attack on Al-Amariyah was not an accident. The U.S. was trying to
terrorize the population.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Of course, economic sanctions that have lasted eight years target
civilians. More than 1.7 million civilians have died from hunger and disease according to UNICEF, the UN agency that evaluates children's
health.  It is not known if this attack was intentional or an accident proving that the Pentagon's `smart' missiles aren't always so smart.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"But the fact that at least one and possibly two of these huge bombs
crashed into residential housing is not in dispute. It was the middle of the day on Monday, a quiet afternoon, when Iraqi families in
al-Jumuhuriya had their homes and their worlds literally blown apart by U.S. missiles," Becker said.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">CNN reported eleven killed and 59 wounded, some of them suffering
serious burns. Many of the dead were children and some of their mothers.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Why did the attack happen? Here lies the deepest irony, according to
the IAC spokesperson. Because Iraqi planes dared to fly into the No-Fly Zone, says the Pentagon spokesperson, Frank
Leyhew. "Iraqi actions pose serious threats to our air crews and our actions today
are an appropriate response to these threats," Leyhew told the Associated Press following the reports of the strike on the
residential neighborhood.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"The Pentagon won't find any Arab people who believe the U.S. bombing
was an `appropriate response,'" Becker said.  The United States and Britain declared all of southern Iraq a No-Fly Zone on the pretext
that the "people of southern Iraq would then be safe from Saddam Hussein's air force."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Remember in Vietnam the famous interview with an U.S. army colonel
who, surveying a peasant village that had been set aflame by napalm bombs, said `we had to burn their village to save them from the
communists.' That remark was made famous for its absurdity. It became a symbol of the ludicrous character of the U.S. war propaganda,"
Becker asserted.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">He continued, "For the last month U.S. warplanes have lobbed missile
after missile into southern Iraq on the pretext that the No-Fly Zones, one in northern Iraq and the other in the south, must be enforced. Who
and what gives the United States and Britain the right to declare that Iraq can't fly its own planes in its own air space? Not the United
Nations! These two imperialist powers just proclaimed that they would shoot down any Iraqi aircraft that fly in these two zones.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"The U.S. says it is `concerned' about the Kurds in northern Iraq and
the Shiite population in the south. That's hogwash. Those are the people who are being killed and maimed by U.S. bombs and missiles. The
real reason is that the U.S. wants control over these two regions because that is where Iraq's oil reserves are located. This oil
constitutes 10% of the worlds known reserves."</font></P>
