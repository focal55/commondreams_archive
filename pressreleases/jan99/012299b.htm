        - January 22 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">As ministers and officials from 24 nations prepare to gather in Antarctica, 
Greenpeace has taken action to stop illegal or &quot;pirate&quot; fishing for
        toothfish, one of the major threats to the pristine wilderness of Antarctica's 
oceans. The international environmental group has sent the MV Arctic Sunrise to 
the Southern Ocean to document and expose illegal fishing for toothfish <A 
href="#one">(1)</A>.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Illegal fishing fleets are destroying the Southern Ocean 
ecosystem,&quot; said Greenpeace campaigner Cristina Mormorunni on board the 
Arctic Sunrise. &quot;The countries attending this Antarctic meeting represent 
95% of the world's market in toothfish. Their governments must act immediately 
to stop the international trade in illegally caught fish. Greenpeace did not 
campaign to protect Antarctica so its surrounding ocean could be plundered by 
poachers.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A gold rush has developed in the Southern Ocean for toothfish that is so 
valuable that the industry calls it &quot;white gold&quot;. In some areas up to 
90% of the total toothfish catch is taken by illegal and unregulated longliners. 
In 1997 the total illegal catch of toothfish was around 100,000 tons with a 
value of over US$500 million. This represents more than half of all toothfish 
sold to consumers around the world each year.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The toothfish is an important part of the Southern Ocean's remote and fragile 
ecosystem. Its sudden demise could have serious implications for the 
biodiversity of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, which includes albatrosses, 
petrels, penguins, seals, elephant seals and whales.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Scientists predict that, if illegal fishing continues at the present rate, 
the toothfish will be commercially extinct in less than three years. In addition 
to toothfish, the illegal fleets are incidentally killing up to 100,000 seabirds 
every year. Scientists also believe that some species of albatrosses and petrels 
which are hooked and drowned by this longline fishery will be seriously 
threatened with extinction.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Commercial whaling also continues in the Southern Ocean, which was officially 
declared a whale sanctuary in 1994 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Despite the international status of the sanctuary, one country, Japan, 
ignores it and keeps hunting whales in the Southern Ocean waters for a bogus 
&quot;scientific research&quot; program which has been actively opposed by 
Greenpeace and condemned by the international community.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Pirate fishing on the high seas is a growing problem worldwide (especially in 
the Southern Ocean, Mediterranean, South Atlantic, East and West coasts of 
Africa) particularly as the number and power of fishing vessels climbs far 
beyond what global fish stocks can sustain. There has been a significant 
increase in the fishing power of so-called &quot;flag of convenience&quot; 
states such as Panama, Honduras, Belize, Cyprus and Liberia which are routinely 
offering their flags to fishing vessels from other countries wishing to fish in 
violation of international laws <A href="#two">(2)</A>.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The 'Ministerial on Ice' meeting will be based at Scott Base and McMurdo 
Station from January 24 -28, 1999.</font>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">### </font></p>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial"> <BR>Notes to Editors:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><A name=one>(1)</A> The toothfish grows slowly and to more than two metres 
long. It can live for 50 years and does not breed until it is at least 10 years 
old. It lives in deep waters (from 300 to 3,500 metres) and is found on 
seamounts and continental shelves around most sub-Antarctic islands. Like many 
deep-sea species, little is known about the toothfish. It is known that it is 
part of the sperm whale's diet and scientists estimate that it comprises up to 
98% of the elephant seal's fish diet. In the market, the toothfish is known by 
many names including sea bass, Chilean sea bass, Chilean grouper and black hake.</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><A name=two>(2)</A> Over the past several years, the United Nations General 
Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a series of resolutions condemning pirate fishing.</font></td>
