      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - January 25 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">This week's visit to the USA by Pope John Paul II, coupled with his recent 
statements against the death penalty, should serve as a timely reminder to the 
USA that it is high time for the country to examine its own human rights record, 
Amnesty International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">John Paul II's Christmas message -- asking for urgent and adequate measures 
to defend human life and to end the death penalty -- as well as earlier 
statements supporting a proposal for a moratorium on executions in the year 
2000, has raised hopes that His Holiness might raise the issue of human rights 
in the USA in his meeting with President Bill Clinton.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International -- which is currently holding a worldwide campaign 
challenging the US government to live up to international human rights standards 
within its own territory -- is particularly concerned at the use of the death 
penalty against juvenile offenders in the USA.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Amnesty International would particularly like His Holiness to remind 
President Clinton and the US federal authorities of their duty to ensure that 
all government officials abide by the country's international obligations,&quot; 
the organization stressed. &quot;These obligations include the global ban on the 
use of the death penalty against children.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Several prisoners are due to be executed in the USA within the coming weeks. 
One of them, Sean Sellers, would be the first US prisoner put to death for a 
crime committed when under 17. As such, his killing would represent a further 
disturbing development in the USA’s attachment to the death penalty.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The execution of this young man for a crime committed when he was still 
a child, would send a brutal message into national and global society from one 
of the most powerful and influential countries on earth,&quot; Amnesty 
International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Another death penalty case currently being highlighted by Amnesty 
International is that of Randolph Reeves, a native American who was tried before 
an all-white jury and convicted of capital murder despite mitigating 
circumstances. The father of one of the murdered victims in this case -- Janet 
Meaner -- opposes the execution:</font>
<P><I><font size="2" face="Arial">I was born and raised in the belief that violence is not an acceptable 
method of solving the problems that arise in our daily lives... The fact that my 
daughter, Janet, was a victim of murder has not changed that belief... The use 
of the death penalty only lowers the standards of government to the mentality of 
the murderer himself...</font></I> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Hours before his 14 January date with death, Mr Reeves received a stay of 
execution from the Nebraska Supreme Court. Amnesty International fears that this 
stay will be lifted in the future and Mr Reeves will die at the hands of the 
state.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The USA's use of the death penalty undermines the whole framework of 
international human rights standards built up since the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights was adopted in 1948,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;This 
-- together with the fact that human rights violations are taking place at the 
hands of police officers, prison guards, immigration and other officials in the 
USA -- points to the need for the country to examine its current stand on human 
rights.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Amnesty International hopes John Paul II's visit will lead to such a 
reflection and to a clear commitment on the part of the US federal, state and 
local authorities to increase accountability on human rights issues and achieve 
concrete reforms to bring an end to these abuses.&quot;</font>
