        To Monitor, Regulate And Prevent ‘Mad Cow' Type Diseases In The United

        - January 7 -
Today, Thursday, January 7, 1999, two formal legal petitions were filed 
demanding that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) act immediately to monitor, regulate and prevent ‘mad cow' 
type diseases in the United States. These diseases, known as Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathies, or TSEs, are killing people, deer, elk and sheep in 
the United States. Petitioners include the Humane Farming Association, the 
Center for Food Safety, a group of United States CJD victims and their families 
and consumer, farm and animal protectionists. <BR><BR>The demand for immediate 
government action is given added urgency by the extremely unusual case of a 
thirty-year old Utah man, R. Douglas McEwen, who is now terminally ill with CJD, 
a 'mad cow' type disease in humans. Mr. McEwen hunted deer and elk; it is feared 
he may have contracted CJD by eating or handling deer or elk infected with 'mad 
deer' disease. Additionally, there is industry and governmental concern that as 
a frequent donor Mr. McEwen may have contaminated blood products 
internationally. <BR><BR>Mr. McEwen and his wife Tracie are petitioners in 
today's legal actions. His fatal disease underscores concerns that current 
federal regulations are grossly inadequate to prevent and monitor potential 
animal and human epidemics in the United States.<BR><BR>The family of ‘mad cow' 
type disease, TSEs, include numerous strains and have different names in 
different species. The best known strain is British Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy (BSE), dubbed ‘mad cow disease,' which has now spread into the 
British human population as ‘new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease' or nvCJD. So 
far 33 teenagers or young adults are confirmed dead or dying of nvCJD. Since the 
disease has a virtually invisible incubation period that might last decades, it 
won't be known for many years whether the final toll will be in the dozens, 
hundreds or thousands of human lives.<BR><BR>In the United States efforts to 
identify, monitor and prevent human and animal deaths from TSE diseases have 
been grossly inadequate, despite the fact that people, deer, elk and sheep in 
the U.S. are dying from these diseases, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) 
in people, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer and elk, and scrapie in sheep. 
<BR><BR>CJD in humans in the U.S. appears to be often misdiagnosed as 
Alzheimer's or other types of fatal dementia, and seems much more prevalent than 
admitted by government agencies. Given the very long invisible incubation period 
of this 100% fatal disease, and that fact that it can be spread by infected 
medical instruments and is almost impossible to kill by heat and disinfection, 
and the consequences of failing to identify the disease are extremely 
serious.<BR><BR>The first legal petition demands that the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) aggressively look for CJD in humans and make CJD a 
reportable and monitored disease. This petition is also being filed in all fifty 
states with the appropriate state health officials.<BR><BR>The second legal 
petition demands that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) close serious 
loopholes in U.S. animal feed regulations which currently allow types of 
cannibalistic feeding practices known to cause and spread 'mad cow' type 
diseases in animals and humans. For instance, current U.S. regulations allow 
calves to be fed milk replacer containing cattle blood protein, and pigs to be 
fed back to pigs and cattle. U.S. sheep infected with scrapie, a 'mad cow' type 
disease, can be used for pet and pig feed in the U.S. <BR><BR>Commenting on 
today's legal actions Bradley Miller, National Director of the Humane Farming 
Association stated, &quot;TSEs represent a potentially devastating threat to 
both human and animal health. Our government's response to date has been 
shamefully inadequate. These legal actions provide a blueprint by which federal 
and state agencies can act decisively to prevent a TSE epidemic in this 
country.&quot; <BR><BR>Dr. Michael Hansen, Research Associate of Consumer's 
Union commented, &quot;The current increase of TSEs in wildlife and humans shows 
that the time for effective prevention may be running out. The federal agencies 
must immediately take action to avert what could become a very significant 
public health problem.&quot;<BR><BR>Andrew Kimbrell, public interest attorney 
and Director of the Center for Food Safety stated, &quot;Given what we know now, 
it is unconscionable that the CDC is not strictly monitoring this disease, and 
that the FDA is still allowing the feeding of blood and other animal by-products 
to animals. The federal agencies are obviously putting the interests of 
agribusiness companies ahead of their duty to protect the public from this 
terrible and fatal group of diseases. We will go to court if necessary to ensure 
that the agencies do their job in protecting human health and animal 
welfare.&quot; </font>
