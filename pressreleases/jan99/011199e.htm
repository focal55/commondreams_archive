        - January 11 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">At a press conference today at the Hyatt Regency Albuquerque, Defenders of 
Wildlife and a group of farming, ranching, and conservation representatives 
decried the anti-environmental, anti-small-family-farm policies of the American 
Farm Bureau Federation of America (AFBF). Defenders also again called on the 
AFBF to drop out of the appeal on its lawsuit that could result in the removal 
and death of all gray wolves in and around Yellowstone National Park and central 
Idaho.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During the press conference, held adjacent to the Albuquerque Convention 
Center where the AFBF is holding its annual convention through January 14, 
Defenders President Rodger Schlickeisen presented Rami, an ambassador wolf from
Mission:Wolf, the Colorado-based wolf education center. &quot;Rami represents 
the growing movement among environmentalists and stewardship-minded ranchers and 
farmers to protect and preserve all things wild,&quot; Schlickeisen said. 
&quot;There is room enough for wildlife and human interests; the two are 
compatible.&quot; </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In December 1997, a Wyoming federal judge ruled in favor of an AFBF lawsuit, 
using an obscure interpretation of the Endangered Species Act, and ordered the 
removal of all gray wolves in and around Yellowstone National Park and central 
Idaho. Removal likely would result in the wolves being killed, as there is no 
place for them to go. The judge stayed his own order, pending expected appeals 
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and others, including Defenders of 
Wildlife. Defenders has appealed on behalf of the wolves and the public, and the 
appeals case could be heard within the next few months.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Citing a farm poll commissioned by Defenders of Wildlife, Defenders Species 
Conservation Director Bob Ferris pointed out that the AFBF may not be the voice 
of the family farmer that they claim to be. &quot;It's interesting that more 
farmers call themselves environmentalists, 69 percent, than are members of the 
Farm Bureau, 48 percent,&quot; Ferris explained. &quot;In fact, most family 
farmers feel they have no advocates, and only one in four names the Farm Bureau 
as their voice. Family farmers strongly oppose many of the Farm Bureau's 
initiatives, and we suspect that most of the bureau's own members would too, if 
they were aware of bureau policies.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking with Defenders were several leaders of the farming and ranching 
community. Bill Christison, president of the National Family Farm Coalition, 
spoke on behalf of farmers and ranchers nationwide who believe that AFBF 
policies have advanced the interests of large agribusiness corporations over 
those of the family farmer and the environment.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Farm Bureau doesn't speak for the family farmer or 
rancher,&quot; Schlickeisen said. &quot;They are simply an insurance and 
agribusiness giant, that doesn't represent the views even of its own members, 
and they have ridden rough shod over farmers and rural Americans for too long. 
Their constant attacks on clean air, clean water, and wildlife restoration 
projects serve to illustrate how far off base they are from most American 
farmers.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Schlickeisen suggested that a prime example of how environmentalists and 
ranchers can work together to preserve nature can be found in the Wolf Country 
Beef program, recently initiated in New Mexico and soon to be launched in 
Arizona. The Wolf Country Beef seal authenticates that the beef has been raised 
on ranches that agree to allow predator restoration to occur on lands under 
their care. Such Wolf Country ranchers will not resort to lethal controls on 
coyotes, wolves, or other predators. Jim Winder of Heritage Ranches is one of 
the first ranchers who signed up to initiate the program. &quot;This program 
gives the public a way to vote for the kind of management they want on public 
land,&quot; Winder says. &quot;I'm leasing your land. How dare I say `no' to 
wolf reintroduction. I have certain duties to my landlord.&quot; Wolf Country 
Beef is currently available at La Montanita Co-op in New Mexico.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;And it's a two-way street,&quot; Schlickeisen said. &quot;Defenders 
has long been more than willing to work with family ranchers.&quot; He 
continued, &quot;Wolf predation on livestock is a rare occurrence. But when it 
does happen, we don't ask the rancher to bear the cost. We've put our money 
where our mouth is with our Wolf Compensation Trust.&quot; Defenders maintains a 
$100,000 Wolf Compensation Trust to reimburse ranchers for any verified loss due 
to wolf predation. To date, Defenders has paid more than $70,000 to more than 65 
separate ranchers.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Schlickeisen summarized, &quot;Plain and simple, the Farm Bureau claims to 
represent family farming and ranching, but their primary interest is assisting 
large corporate farming, selling insurance, and using their membership dues and 
profits to push an extremist political agenda. Their opposition to wolf 
reintroduction is just one example. The vast majority of Americans, including 
most Farm Bureau members, overwhelmingly want the Yellowstone wolves to remain 
in the park. We want the Farm Bureau to withdraw immediately its legal 
objections to leaving the Yellowstone wolves in the park where they 
belong.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to the Albuquerque press conference, Defenders is providing a 
forum for farmers to discuss these issues at press conferences in Seattle on 
Monday; Springfield, Illinois and Sacramento, California on Tuesday; and Santa 
Monica, California on Wednesday. More detailed information on these events can 
be obtained by calling Roni Lieberman at 202-682-9400 x266. </font></P>
