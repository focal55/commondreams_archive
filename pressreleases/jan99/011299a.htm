      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - January 12 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The long-postponed review of some interrogation methods used by the General 
Security Service (GSS) starting on Wednesday in Israel's High Court must bring 
to an end the shame of the effective legalization of torture in the country, 
Amnesty International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The methods to be reviewed include extremely violent shaking (still used 
despite causing the death of a detainee in 1995); sleep deprivation for periods 
of up to several days; forcing detainees to remain in painful positions for 
hours on end; forcing detainees to listen to incessant screeching music; 
prolonged squatting; confinement to cupboard-sized rooms and exposure to heat 
and cold.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Israel is the only country in the world to have effectively legalized 
torture by authorizing interrogators to use these methods,&quot; the 
organization added.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In recent years, the Israeli High Court has frequently shown a willingness to 
sacrifice justice for security considerations and has more than once refused to 
issue injunctions banning the use of physical force during interrogation.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is now time for the court to speak out to end practices which 
contravene Israel's international commitment to end torture,&quot; Amnesty 
International urged.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;By outlawing torture and ill-treatment during interrogation the court 
would finally fulfill its sacred obligation to uphold justice, ethics and human 
rights.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The hearing on the matter was first scheduled in January 1998 by Aharon
Barak, President of the Israeli High Court, after a case involving Fu'ad 'Abed 
Qur’an, a university student, interrogated -- like hundreds of other 
Palestinians -- by these methods. A sitting held in May 1998 was immediately 
adjourned. After hearing the petitions Chief Justice Barak commented that the 
question should be dealt with by the legislature.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture said in his 1991 
report: &quot;Under circumstances in which torture is practiced or condoned by 
the authorities, it is the judiciary which forms the last bastion for the 
protection of citizens' basic rights.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The High Court should not further postpone the case; it should not pass 
the buck to the Knesset and it should certainly not rule in favor of practices 
amounting to torture,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Torture has been effectively legalized in Israel by 
various means:<BR>1) secret guidelines to a report by the Landau Commission into 
interrogation methods in 1987 which authorized the GSS to use &quot;a moderate 
measure of physical pressure&quot; during interrogations.<BR>2) a ministerial 
committee which has continued to approve the use of physical pressure by the GSS 
and, since 1994, has allowed the use of &quot;increased physical 
pressure&quot;.<BR>3) the Israeli High Court of Justice, which in individual 
cases has ruled that physical pressure can be used against detainees.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Israel uses the excuse that &quot;torture might be necessary to save a 
roomful of people from a ticking bomb&quot;. However, under international law 
torture is always prohibited. Article 2 (2) of the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which Israel 
ratified in 1991, states that: &quot;No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, 
whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political in stability or 
any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, torture is used systematically against hundreds of Palestinians 
every year, even in situations where no &quot;ticking bomb&quot; is involved. 
The mockery of this argument is shown by the fact that in the majority of cases 
interrogators take weekends off, using interrogation methods constituting 
torture only from Sunday to Thursday.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The United Nations Committee against Torture, a committee of international 
experts which reviews countries' application of the United Nations Convention 
against Torture, stated in 1997 and 1998 that Israel's interrogation methods 
constituted torture or ill-treatment banned by the convention.</font></P>
