Major Gaps Exist In Food-Safety Surveillance, CSPI Charges Public “Kept In The

      - January 21 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">In “Outbreak Alert!” — a 23-page report issued today — the nonprofit Center 
for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called on the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) to publish a comprehensive and timely listing of
      foodborne-illness outbreaks. Such a listing could help public health officials 
contain current outbreaks and prevent future ones.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">“With headline after headline alerting consumers to food-poisoning outbreaks, 
the public might be surprised to learn that no government agency keeps a 
complete list of those outbreaks. As the nation’s disease monitor, CDC should be 
tracking outbreak trends and quickly releasing information to health officials 
and the public,” said CSPI food-safety director Caroline Smith DeWaal.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">“An up-to-date, readily available inventory of outbreaks would help health 
officials nip outbreaks in the bud and prevent new ones. As it is, CDC estimates 
that foodborne pathogens cause as many as 9,000 deaths and 33 million illnesses 
annually,” added DeWaal.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While CDC and the states investigate outbreaks, no federal agency maintains 
and analyzes a comprehensive list of all such outbreaks. To help fill that gap, 
CSPI used numerous documented sources such as CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality 
Weekly Report, medical journal articles, and government publications to compile 
a list of 225 foodborne-illness outbreaks that occurred between 1990 and 1998. 
Those 225 outbreak reports represent only a fraction of outbreaks that occurred 
during this period.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The findings in “Outbreak Alert!” were released today at the annual 
conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 
Anaheim, California. Among them:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Meat and poultry, with 65 reports, were the most frequent causes of 
outbreaks. Ground beef was the food most likely to be implicated, causing 37 of 
the 65 outbreaks.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Fruits, vegetables, and salads were the second-most-likely food group to be 
linked to an outbreak, with a total of 48 reports. Seafood (both finfish and 
shellfish) was responsible for 32 outbreaks.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">An assortment of multi-ingredient foods was responsible for 63 outbreaks. 
The category includes desserts, sauces, egg dishes, pasta dishes, ethnic foods, 
and stuffing. In three-quarters of those cases, the cause of illness was 
Salmonella enteritidis, a bacterium that commonly contaminates eggs.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Foods regulated by the Food and Drug Administration caused over twice as 
many outbreaks as foods regulated by the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture.</font></LI></UL><font size="2" face="Arial">“Public-health officials need to know — and consumers 
deserve to know — which foods are causing food-poisoning outbreaks,” said
      DeWaal. “CDC is keeping the public in the dark about outbreak trends.”</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">CSPI recommended that CDC serve as the national clearinghouse by maintaining 
a comprehensive inventory of outbreak investigations. CSPI also called on the 
states to report all foodborne-illness outbreaks to CDC. In addition, CSPI urged 
Congress to provide CDC and the states with the resources they need to reduce 
food-poisoning outbreaks to an absolute minimum.</font> </P>
