        - January 14 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Women across America are today issuing a new challenge to our nation and to 
every legislator and policy maker: secure America’s and our families’ economic 
future by enacting policies that help realize the economic potential of women. 
From Augusta, Maine to Olympia, Washington women are sounding a call to action 
to commit themselves and others to real progress and specific proposals. It is 
called A Challenge to Secure America’s Economic Future.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We understand what it will take to secure a strong, growing economy, 
offering the hope of opportunity and prosperity to every American,&quot; said 
Linda Tarr-Whelan, President and CEO of the Center for Policy Alternatives that 
has been the catalyst and coordinator of this nationwide challenge. &quot;To 
sustain our economy, support our families, and strengthen our communities, we 
must recognize and invest in the economic power and priorities of women,&quot; 
continued Tarr-Whelan, who also serves as U.S. Representative to the U.N. 
Commission on the Status of Women. &quot;We want to provide a proactive policy 
agenda for the new legislative sessions and offer strategies for change in the 
public and private sectors.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In news conferences in state capitol buildings across the country, women 
lawmakers, community leaders and business people are announcing specific plans 
to enact the agenda through a variety of legislative initiatives in 1999 state 
legislatures. Events are being conducted in 20 states: Arizona, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, 
Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia. <I><A 
href="http://www.cfpa.org/womensvoices/Challenge/stateaction.html"><B>(Click here to see a 
complete list of state activities.)</B></A> </I>State activites include:</font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>MASSACHUSETTS</B> – in Boston, the Massachusetts Statewide Legislative 
Network will issue the Challenge, cosponsor a forum with key women legislators 
at the capitol and focus on two bills proposing options for paid family and 
medical leave. <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>GEORGIA</B> -- in Atlanta, Senator Connie Stokes, Senator Donzella James, 
and Representative Nan Grogan Orrock and other legislators will announce a 
comprehensive program including a living wage, funding for a women's business 
center, education, and health care. <BR>
  </font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>TEXAS</B> – in Austin, State Representatives Vilma Luna and Dora
  Olivo, 
along with Diane Stewart of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, will 
outline a legislative agenda that encompasses education and job training, access 
to capital for women entrepreneurs and access to quality childcare and after 
school care.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>WASHINGTON</B> – in Olympia, a bipartisan group of legislators and a 
coalition of community activists will announce an agenda cutting across the 
areas of economic self-sufficiency; entrepreneurship; health and security; and 
family and work.</font></LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our Challenge to Secure America’s Future is a challenge to every one of 
us to take action as we can to ensure that women are full players in our 
economic future. This is the beginning of a new, sustained effort to change our 
policies, our way of thinking and our future,&quot; said Tarr-Whelan, noting 
that women currently make 80 percent of all consumer purchasing decisions and 
women-owned businesses are among the fastest growing sectors of our economy.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><A href="http://www.cfpa.org/womensvoices/Challenge/challenge.html"><B>The Challenge to 
Secure America’s Future</B></A>, to lawmakers, policy makers, community leaders, 
and others, is straightforward:</font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Endorse an economic agenda to secure America’s economic future by securing 
for women economic self-sufficiency, the opportunity for entrepreneurship, 
health and security, and a balance between family and work;</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Enact that agenda to close the gap between women’s real economic power and 
unrealized economic potential;</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Ensure this agenda becomes real to change and improve the lives of American 
women, their families, and their future.</font></LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We issue this challenge believing we must, through our actions and our 
public policy, put our values to work demonstrating that we understand what it 
will take to secure a strong, growing economy, offering the hope of opportunity 
and prosperity to every American,&quot; said Tarr-Whelan. &quot;We want to 
provide a proactive policy agenda for the new legislative sessions and offer 
strategies.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Challenge to Secure America’s Economic Future finds its roots in the work 
of the Center For Policy Alternatives, one of America’s leading nonprofit, 
nonpartisan public policy and leadership development centers and its 
groundbreaking economic plan: <I><A

Agenda: Women’s Voices for Solutions.</B></A></I></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Center for Policy Alternatives has worked for more than two decades to 
identify and address the concerns of American women. <A 
href="http://www.cfpa.org/womensvoices/9704summitreport/toc.html"><I><B>America’s Economic 
Agenda: Women’s Voices for Solutions</B></I></A>, completed in April 1998,

April 1997 <A href="http://www.cfpa.org/whatsnew/9704summit/summit.html"><B>Women’s Economic Leadership 
Summit</B></A> cosponsored by CPA and the White House.</font></P>
