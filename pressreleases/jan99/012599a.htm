        YORK - January 25 -
The U.S. energy conglomerate Enron is complicit in serious human rights abuse in 
India, Human Rights Watch charges in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/hrw/reports/1999/enron/">report released today.</font></a>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Enron Power Corporation owns 50 percent of the Dabhol Power Corporation, which 
employs security forces who routinely beat and harass people demonstrating 
peacefully against the power plant. The report charges that Dabhol has 
indirectly benefited from other repressive government actions aimed at quelling 
opposition to the plant, which is the largest single foreign investment in India 
and the largest private power project in the world. </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The project is a joint-venture of three U.S. companies -- the Houston-based 
Enron Corporation which is the principal shareholder and operator; General 
Electric; and Bechtel -- and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report documents how Indian authorities have misused Indian law to charge 
peaceful demonstrators with serious crimes. Meanwhile, the U.S. government and 
its Export-Import Bank, which have both vigorously promoted Enron’s investment 
in India, have failed to address the human rights questions that they are 
obliged to investigate. The report calls on international financial institutions 
to take human rights into consideration when financing projects.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Governments have a primary responsibility to make sure that human 
rights violations don't take place,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director 
of Human Rights Watch. &quot;But corporations can't look the other way when 
protesters are being beaten right outside their front gates. Enron has been 
shirking its responsibility to behave as a decent global citizen.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch urged the corporate and political leaders gathered this 
week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to examine the Enron 
investment in India as part of their focus this year on &quot;Responsible
Globality.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The 166-page report is the result of a year-long investigation and provides 
detailed evidence of the systematic suppression of freedom of expression and 
peaceful assembly, as well as police use of arbitrary detentions and excessive 
force against opponents of the Enron project. All of these are violations of 
international laws and treaties that the Indian government has signed.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Local opposition to the Enron project began in 1992 over concerns about 
&quot;transparency,&quot; corruption, and the hasty negotiations over the terms 
of Enron’s investment. Since then, protests have erupted over local farmers’ 
complaints that the power plant has unfairly acquired their land and has 
diverted scarce water for its needs. Fishermen have protested over fears that 
when power generation begins in March 1999, effluents will cause a rise in 
seawater temperatures and kill off their fish harvests.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In one instance in June 1997, Maharashtra police raided a fishing village 
where many residents opposed the power plant. They arbitrarily beat and arrested 
dozens of villagers, including Sadhana Bhalekar, the wife of a well- known 
protester against the plant. They broke down the door and window of Bhalekar’s 
bathroom and dragged her naked out into the street, beating her with batons. 
Bhalekar was three months pregnant at the time.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In another instance in May 1997, police beat and arrested nearly 180 
protesters who were demonstrating peacefully outside the company gates. In its 
investigation, Human Rights Watch documented thirty similar incidents and heard 
allegations of many more.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Human Rights Watch report also documents how contractors for the Dabhol 
Power Corporation harassed and attacked individuals opposed to the power plant.  
Police refused to investigate complaints, and in several cases, actually 
arrested the victims on trumped-up charges. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the project’s inception in 1992, Enron and the government of 
Maharashtra state have repeatedly ignored public complaints. &quot;Dabhol Power 
Corporation would not tolerate any human rights abuses by its employees and 
sub-contractors,&quot; the company said in a 1997 statement. &quot;If you have 
concerns about police actions, we suggest that you take it up with the police or 
government body that is responsible for their operations.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our report clearly establishes that people who opposed the power plant 
were subjected to human rights abuses,&quot; said Roth. &quot;Enron’s 
responsibilities don’t end at the perimeter of its plant premises. Given the 
size and impact of its facility, the company must address abuses that aim to 
silence its opposition.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Dabhol Power Corporation, under provisions of law, paid the abusive state 
forces for the security they provided to the company.  These forces, located 
adjacent to the project site, were stationed there largely for the purpose of 
dealing with protests. While they report to local police, their expenses are 
paid by the company.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The U.S. government bears special responsibility because of its aggressive 
lobbying on behalf of the three U.S.-based companies developing the project, and 
because it extended hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds for the 
project while seemingly indifferent to human rights-related policies that apply 
to such transactions. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch noted that although the Indian press widely reported the 
human rights troubles around the power plant, U.S. officials failed to 
investigate the matter. Enron has received between $290 million and $300 million 
in U.S. government loan guarantees for its investment in Dabhol. The State 
Department’s entire assessment for one Export-Import Bank loan read, &quot;The 
State Department has no objection to this case on political grounds or on the 
basis of human rights issues.&quot; U.S. law requires that such an assessment be 
carried out before loan guarantees can be extended.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The U.S. ambassador to India in the mid-1990's, Frank Wisner, told Human 
Rights Watch in an interview, &quot;I have never seen any information on human 
rights violations related to Dabhol.&quot; Ambassador Wisner was named to the 
board of directors of Enron Oil and Gas, a subsidiary of the Enron Corporation, 
on October 28, 1997, a few months after he left his post in India.</font>
