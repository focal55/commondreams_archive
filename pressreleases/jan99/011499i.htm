        CITY - January 14 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
Prosecutors and judges deserve much of the blame for human rights violations 
that occur in Mexico, including torture and &quot;disappearances,&quot; 
according to a <A href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/mexico/">new report by 
Human Rights Watch.</A> Through willful ignorance or purposeful fabrication of 
evidence, prosecutors routinely prosecute victims using evidence obtained 
through human rights violations, and judges avail themselves of permissive law 
and legal precedent to condemn victims while ignoring abuses. <BR>
        </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Mexico's justice system is far more likely to prosecute a torture 
victim, using evidence obtained through abuses, than it is to send the torturer 
to prison,&quot; commented José Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watch's executive 
director for the Americas. &quot;Far from leading to justice, that creates 
injustice.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Based on case studies drawn from five Mexican states, the report is the 
result of two years of investigation. It scrutinizes incidents of torture, 
&quot;disappearance,&quot; and extrajudicial execution, then analyzes the 
judicial processes that followed. The report draws cases from the poor and 
predominantly rural south of Oaxaca state, the industrialized central region of 
Morelos and Jalisco, and the northern border states of Baja California and
Tamaulipas. Demonstrating the variety of circumstances in which the justice 
system fails, it scrutinizes incidents related to counterinsurgency, drugs, and 
common crime.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite a well-developed formal system of human rights protections, the 
Mexican government has failed to reduce, much less resolve, the serious, 
seemingly intractable human rights problems suffered throughout the country. <A 
href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/mexico/">Systemic Injustice: Torture, 
&quot;Disappearance,&quot; and Extrajudicial Execution in Mexico</A> concludes 
that, faced with widespread human rights violations, the government has opted to 
treat human rights as an issue to be managed politically, countered with facile 
statistics, or handled through insufficient reforms or initiatives.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">To its credit, the government of President Ernesto Zedillo has recognized 
that human rights violations take place, and it has called in general terms for 
greater attention to human rights issues. The report also notes important human 
rights initiatives undertaken by this and prior governments, including the 
creation of the National Human Rights Commission in 1990, passage of the Federal 
Law to Prevent and Punish Torture in 1991, legal reforms strengthening human 
rights protections in 1990 and 1993, and the recent decision of the Mexican 
government to recognize the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report concludes that when confronted with specific cases of human rights 
violations, authorities are much more likely to close ranks and deny that abuses 
took place than they are to insist that human rights violators be brought to 
justice. At the same time, prosecutors are encouraged to use evidence obtained 
through abuse because they face no penalty for doing so their bosses do not 
punish them and judges do not reject their cases.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Both in practice and by law, Mexico's justice system is fundamentally 
ambiguous about what to do with evidence obtained during or following human 
rights violations, including illegal arrests and searches, prolonged detention, 
and torture or other forms of coercion. The Constitution and laws on the books 
give grounds to dismiss evidence obtained through human rights violations and to 
require the prosecution of public officials guilty of accepting or admitting 
such evidence. The law is often vague on these issues, however, and courts often 
rule in favor of accepting impugned evidence.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report calls on the Mexican government to eliminate evidence that is 
unreliable because it was coerced or fabricated. The government must establish a 
system of accountability for public servants, including police, prosecutors, and 
judges. Human Rights Watch calls on Mexico's Congress to play a more active role 
in promoting human rights, and it urges greater involvement by the United 
States, European Union, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and United 
Nations.</font></P>
