        - January 21 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
Human Rights Watch today urged the international community to back a resolution 
condemning China's human rights practices at the next session of the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission in Geneva, from March 22-April 30, 1999. The drafting and 
lobbying for a resolution should begin immediately.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Last year, the key countries that have sponsored such a resolution 
since 1990 opted instead for 'dialogue' with China, saying a 
'non-confrontational' approach would be more effective,&quot; said Sidney Jones, 
Asia director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;But today China is carrying out one 
of the worst crackdowns against political dissent since 1989. The time for 
silence is over.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the governments that decided not to sponsor a resolution last year 
cited the fact that in the last six years, no resolution against China had 
actually been passed, though in 1995 a measure failed by a single vote. Others 
cited the lack of consensus about the value of a resolution. And virtually all 
cited commitments China had made in exchange for dropping the annual effort at a 
resolution, including promises to sign key international human rights treaties 
and to welcome a visit to China by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary 
Robinson.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Jones said none of those arguments held up. &quot;Past failures to adopt a 
resolution were largely due to a lack of political will by the sponsors, who did 
not devote as much time and resources to getting a resolution passed as China 
spent getting it defeated.&quot; She also pointed out that under the pressure of 
the Geneva discussion, Beijing took limited steps such as agreeing to visits by 
the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (in 1997) and U.N. Special 
Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance (in 1994), but stopped short of implementing 
their recommendations for specific reforms.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The decision on whether or not to criticize China in the U.N.'s most 
important human rights body should be based on principle, not on a calculated 
assessment of a motion's success,&quot; said Jones.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch said it was time to revisit the statements made last year 
when governments decided to abandon public criticism of China at the Human 
Rights Commission. Both the European Union (E.U.) and the U.S. set benchmarks 
for what China would have to do to avoid a resolution, but curiously, the 
benchmarks did not include refraining from committing new abuses.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The E.U.'s conditions included a visit to China by Mary Robinson, resumption 
of visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to Chinese 
prisons, release of &quot;a number&quot; of dissidents, signing and submitting 
for ratification the two key human rights covenants and E.U. visits to Tibet. 
The American conditions were release of political prisoners with medical 
problems, signing and submitting for ratification the two key human rights 
covenants, and resuming discussions with the ICRC on prison visits.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The visit to Tibet of ambassadors from the E.U. troika countries took place 
in May 1998 but was marred by reports of at least ten deaths, vicious beatings, 
and prolonged solitary confinement for prisoners who tried to hold a protest at 
Tibet's main prison. Mary Robinson's visit took place in September 1998, but 
Chinese officials produced none of the information she requested on prisoners, 
denied her access to the Panchen Lama, and made no specific commitments on 
ratification of two U.N. human rights treaties. China signed the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in October 1998 but has produced 
no timetable for ratifying it. It has also indicated to diplomats that it 
intends to attach reservations, or exceptions, on key provisions, such as 
Article 19 guaranteeing the right to free expression. No progress was made on 
ICRC visits to prisons.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile, the Chinese government has continued to arrest and punish anyone 
it sees as threatening to its one-party system, clearly violating both the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR. At least one hundred 
members of the Chinese Democracy Party have been detained since July 1998, and 
three have received harsh sentences of eleven to thirteen years in prison. Other 
are awaiting trial. Lin Hai, a software engineer, was put on trial in Shanghai 
in December 1998 for distributing Chinese e-mail addresses to a pro-democracy 
group in Washington; he was given a two-year sentence on January 20. A labor 
rights and democracy activist, Zhang Shanguang, was given a ten-year sentence 
for providing Radio Free Asia information about peasant protests. A poet and 
writer, Ma Zhe, was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of subversion 
for publishing an independent literary journal.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, strict new regulations were adopted on formation of 
non-governmental political and social organizations in October 1998. Chinese 
officials warned film directors, computer software developers, writers and 
artists, the media, and the publishing industry that if they endangered 
&quot;social order&quot; or tried to &quot;overthrow state power&quot; they 
could be imprisoned for life.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In light of these developments, it is difficult for governments to continue 
to claim that dialogues are more effective than criticism in addressing human 
rights issues. Among the countries that abandoned Geneva in favor of carrying 
out &quot;dialogues&quot; were Canada, Australia, Japan, the U.S. and the 
European Union.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In February 1998, the E.U. foreign ministers issued a statement just weeks 
before the first E.U.-China summit in London. They said, &quot;In view of the 
encouraging results in the E.U.-China human rights dialogue, neither the E.U. 
presidency nor member states should table or co-sponsor a draft resolution at 
the next U.N. Commission on Human Rights.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">At the same time, the British government, then in the
E.U. presidency, 
qualified this decision by leaving the door open to future support for a Geneva 
effort. British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said, &quot;We have therefore 
resolved on a new approach in which we are going to put our priority and 
pressure on human rights in China through dialogue with China...Any decision 
that we reach this year in relation to the Commission on Human Rights does not 
necessarily bind us next year. Whether or not we table a resolution at next 
year's Commission on Human Rights will depend upon China showing that it is 
willing to enter into the dialogue in good faith and produce results.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Other countries moved away from sponsoring a resolution, some even earlier 
than the E.U.</font> </P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said in April 1997, &quot;The 
government has decided in light of the significant weakening of consensus of the 
resolution among its traditional co-sponsors that it no longer carries the 
weight it has in past years...We are optimistic that this [package of bilateral 
cooperative programs on human rights] will lead to other opportunities for us to 
influence change in China's human rights practices. Rather than co-sponsor the 
resolution, we would pursue more effective means to influence Chinese respect 
for the human rights of its citizens.&quot;</font>
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Australia's Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, also declared in April 1997, 
&quot;China has agreed to establish a formal and regular bilateral dialogue on 
human rights... While there will inevitably be differences between Australia and 
China on human rights issues, a formal bilateral dialogue will provide a 
framework for dealing with such differences and for pursuing concrete 
improvements in the observance of internationally recognized human rights 
standards in China.&quot; Noting that a resolution on China had never passed, he 
added, &quot;If that sort of diplomacy is not going to be effective, well, you 
have got to think through what <EM>could</EM> be effective.&quot;</font>
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">In the U.S., a State Department spokesman announced the U.S. decision to 
abandon a Geneva resolution in March 1998, about the same time that the 
administration disclosed that President Clinton's trip to China would be moved 
up from November to June: &quot;We have taken note of a number of positive 
developments in the human rights situation in China...While we by no means 
consider [China's promise to sign the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the release of several dissidents] sufficient -- nor do we 
consider the human rights situation in China to be satisfactory -- we have 
determined that there are other, more promising ways to pursue improving the 
human rights situation.&quot;</font>
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">In Germany, then Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said in March 1998: &quot;I 
welcome the fact that China is now a signatory to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and also its announced intention to sign 
the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those are hopeful signs, holding out 
a prospect of further urgently needed progress in enhancing respect for human 
rights in China. This is a goal to which we remain committed. Countries that 
think they can ignore their obligations under international human rights 
conventions are on quite the wrong track.&quot;</font>
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In recent weeks, pressure has been building within several countries to 
suspend bilateral dialogues and begin preparing a resolution for debate in 
Geneva. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
House of Commons adopted a series of recommendations on December 21, 1998. It 
noted that &quot;very grave and widespread abuses of human rights continue in 
China, not least in Tibet&quot; and called on the British government to give 
&quot;serious consideration to supporting the renewal of the previous human 
rights resolution in relation to China at subsequent sessions of the Commission 
on Human Rights in Geneva.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The European Parliament has repeatedly called on the
E.U. to support a China 
motion in Geneva. Sixty members of the U.S. Congress wrote to President Bill 
Clinton on December 10, 1998, urging him to &quot;make a renewed, vigorous 
effort to urge China to comply with its international human rights 
obligations&quot; and to &quot;inform Chinese officials that the U.S. will press 
for reintroduction and adoption of a resolution on China at next spring's U.N. 
Commission meeting...&quot; In his reply on January 5, Clinton wrote that 
&quot;I am not optimistic that such a resolution would garner sufficient support 
in the international community to be an effective tool...We will approach the 
Commission meeting with an open mind, however, and look for the most effective 
ways to highlight human rights abuses in China.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The human rights situation in China has clearly deteriorated; a return to 
Geneva would be a fitting response.</font></P>
