        - January 16 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The bright promise of a new century is clouded by unprecedented threats to 
the stability of the natural world, according to a special millennial edition of 
the <A href="http://www.worldwatch.org/pubs/sow/sow99/index.html">State of the 
World report</A>, released by the Worldwatch Institute today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In a globally interconnected economy, rapid deforestation, falling 
water tables, and accelerating climate change could undermine economies around 
the world in the decades ahead,&quot; said Lester Brown and Christopher Flavin, 
lead authors of the new report.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During the past century, world population grew by more than 4 billion--three 
times the number of people when the century began. At the same time, the use of 
energy and raw materials grew more than ten times.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These trends cannot continue for many more years,&quot; said the 
authors. &quot;As the 21st century approaches, the big question is whether we 
can muster the ingenuity to change--and do so rapidly enough to stave off 
environmentally-based economic decline. The one thing we can say for sure is 
that the 21st century will be as different from the 20th as that one was from 
the 19th.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The 20th century began with extraordinary optimism. Major advances such as 
widespread electric lighting and the emancipation of women were widely 
predicted, but many other developments, such as air travel and the birth-control 
pill, were not. The darkest developments of the 20th century, including two 
world wars and more than a billion people living in poverty, were completely 
unexpected.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, at the dawn of a new century, faith in technology and human progress 
are as common as they were a century ago. In their fascination with information 
technologies, many of today's economic thinkers seem to have forgotten that our 
modern civilization, like its forerunners, is entirely dependent on its 
ecological foundations--foundations that the economy is now eroding.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since our emergence as a species, human societies have continually run up 
against local environmental limits that have caused them to collapse, as local 
forests and cropland were overstressed. But the advances in technology that have 
allowed us to surmount these local limits have transferred the problem of 
environmental limits to the global level, where human activities now threaten 
planetary systems. Among the problems we now face:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">World energy needs are projected to double in the next several decades, but 
no credible geologist foresees a doubling of world oil production, which is 
projected to peak within the next few decades.</font>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">While protein demands are projected to also double in the century ahead, no 
respected marine biologist expects the oceanic fish catch, which has plateaued 
over the last decade, to double. The world's oceans are being pushed beyond the 
breaking point, due to a lethal combination of pollution and over-exploitation. 
Eleven of the 15 most important oceanic fisheries and 70 percent of the major 
fish species are now fully or over-exploited, according to experts. And more 
than half the world's coral reefs are now sick or dying.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Growing stress can also be seen in the world's woodlands, where the clearing 
of tropical forests has contributed recently to unprecedented fires across large 
areas of Southeast Asia, the Amazon, and Central America. In Indonesia alone, 
1,100 airline flights were canceled, and billions of dollars of income were 
lost.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Environmental deterioration is taking a growing toll on a wide range of 
living organisms. Of the 242,000 plant species surveyed by the World 
Conservation Union in 1997, some 33,000, or 14 percent, are threatened with 
extinction--mainly as a result of massive land clearing for housing, roads, and 
industries. This mass extinction is projected to disrupt nature's ability to 
provide essential ecosystem services, ranging from pollination to flood control.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The atmosphere is also under assault. The billions of tons of carbon that 
have been released since the Industrial Revolution have pushed atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide to their highest level in 160,000 years--a 
level that continues to rise each year. As scientists predicted, temperatures 
are rising along with the concentration of carbon dioxide. The latest jump in 
1998 left the global temperature at its highest level since record-keeping began 
in the mid-19th century. Higher temperatures are projected to threaten food 
supplies in the next century, while more severe storms cause economic damage, 
and rising seas inundate coastal cities.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">The early costs of climate change may already be evident: weather-related 
economic damages of $89 billion in 1998 exceeded losses for the decade of the 
1980s. In Central America, 11,000 people were killed by Hurricane Mitch, and 
Honduras suffered losses equivalent to one-third of its annual GDP.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Human societies may also face growing stress in the new century. In Africa, 
for example, where populations have doubled in the last three decades, economic 
growth is already failing to keep up with human needs. Several African 
countries, including Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, where 20-25 percent of the 
adult population is now HIV-positive, are expected to lose one-fifth or more of 
their people within the next few decades. This could undermine their societies 
in the same way the plague did those of Europe in the Middle Ages.</font> </LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our analysis shows that we are entering a new century with an economy 
that cannot take us where we want to go,&quot; said Worldwatch President Lester 
Brown. &quot;Satisfying the projected needs of 8 billion or more people with the 
economy we now have is simply not possible. The western industrial model--the 
fossil-fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economy that so dramatically 
raised living standards in this century--is in trouble.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The shift to an environmentally sustainable economy may be as profound a 
transition as the Industrial Revolution. But just as our great-grandparents were 
able to change a century ago, so must we be ready to change again. In fact, the 
broad outlines of a sustainable economic system that can meet the human needs of 
the next century are beginning to emerge.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The foundation of such a system is a new design principle--one that shifts 
from the one-time depletion of natural resources to an economy that is based on 
renewable energy and that continually reuses and recycles materials. A 
sustainable economy will be a solar-powered, bicycle/rail-based, reuse/recycle 
economy, one that uses energy, water, land, and materials much more efficiently 
and wisely than we do today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Defenders of today's industries point to the costs of environmental 
protection. But reversing the environmental deterioration that has marked the 
20th century is hardly a luxury. Archaeologists study the remains of 
civilizations that undermined their ecological support systems. The Fertile 
Crescent, where agriculture emerged over ten millennia ago, was turned into a 
virtual desert by ancient farmers and herders-and even today, supports only a 
small population.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These societies found themselves on a growth path that was environmentally 
unsustainable-and were not able to make the economic adjustments needed to avoid 
a collapse. Unfortunately, the records do not tell us whether these 
civilizations did not understand the need for change, or whether they saw the 
problem but could not agree on the steps needed to stave off economic decline. 
Today, the adjustments we must make are clear. The question is whether we can 
make them in time.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Building an environmentally sustainable world economy depends on a 
cooperative global effort. No country acting alone can protect the diversity of 
life on Earth or the health of oceanic fisheries. So far, national governments 
have largely failed to effectively implement the last decade's landmark 
environmental treaties--on climate change and biodiversity. One of the big 
challenges of the early 21st century will be to fulfill their ambitious promises 
to stabilize the climate and slow the destruction of species.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the absence of a concerted effort by the wealthy to address the problems 
of poverty and deprivation, building a sustainable future may not be possible. 
Growing poverty, and the political and economic chaos that can be provoked by 
it, reverberate around the world, as was seen in 1998 with the Asian economic 
meltdown, which pushed tens of millions of people below the poverty line in just 
a few months. Meeting the needs of the more than 1 billion people now in poverty 
is essential to making the transition to an environmentally sustainable world 
economy.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;One question facing humanity as the new century approaches is whether 
we can find a new understanding and values that will support a restructuring of 
the global economy,&quot; said author Christopher Flavin. &quot;Although such a 
transformation may seem farfetched, the end-of-the-century perspective offers 
hope. Just as the 19th century was marked by the abolition of slavery and the 
20th century by a new international principle of human rights (adopted by the 
United Nations in 1948), the 21st century will require a new ethic of 
sustainability that includes the need to live within our ecological means. We 
will need a new set of human responsibilities--to the natural world and to 
future generations--to go with our newfound human rights.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">One key to reversing environmental degradation is to tax the activities that 
cause it, according to the report. By putting a price on these activities, the 
market can be harnessed to spur progress. If coal burning is taxed, solar energy 
becomes more economically competitive. If auto emissions are taxed, cleaner 
forms of transportation become more affordable.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The new German government, elected in October 1998, has embarked on the 
world's most ambitious environmental tax reform--reducing taxes on wages by 2.4 
percent, while raising energy taxes by an identical amount. This is a landmark 
step that will push Europe's largest economy in an environmentally sustainable 
direction.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the last decade of the 20th century, Europe is also leading the way in 
some of the industries that are the foundations of a solar economy. Europe has 
added 5,000 megawatts of wind power in the last 5 years, for example, half of it 
in Germany, where the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein gets 15 percent 
of its electricity from the wind. Wind power, now one of Europe's fastest 
growing manufacturing industries, employs thousands of workers.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sales of other new energy technologies are soaring as well. The production of 
solar photovoltaic cells has doubled in the last five years, propelled in part 
by the Japanese government's efforts to promote solar rooftops as a standard 
option for new suburban homes. Fuel cells, which turn hydrogen into electricity 
with water the only byproduct, are meanwhile being spurred by billions of 
dollars of investment capital, as companies pursue them as a replacement for 
everything from the coal-fired power plant to the internal combustion engine.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The effort to replace today's unsustainable economy with one that is suited 
to the demands of the 21st century will create some of the new century's largest 
investment opportunities. Bill Ford, the incoming Chairman of the Ford Motor 
Company, has plans to increase his company's profits by replacing the internal 
combustion engine that was at the center of his great-grandfather's success. 
&quot;Smart companies will get ahead of the wave,&quot; says Ford. &quot;Those 
that don't will be wiped out.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The challenge now is to mobilize public support for a fundamental economic 
transformation-a shift to a 21st century economy that is far less resource 
intensive and polluting, yet even more productive than today's.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No challenge is greater, or more satisfying, than building an 
environmentally sustainable global economy, one where economic and social 
progress can continue, not only in the 21st century, but for many centuries 
beyond,&quot; the authors conclude.</font>
