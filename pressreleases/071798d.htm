    bgcolor="#FFFFFF">ROME - July 17 (10 p.m. local time) - Human Rights Watch tonight
    welcomed the establishment of an International Criminal Court, despite serious flaws in
    the draft treaty.<br>
    <br>
    Final discussions among the 160 delegations gathered in Rome suggest that the treaty's
    detractors, including the United&nbsp; States, will not succeed in preventing its adoption
    before the conference ends in the next few hours.<br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch has condemned several provisions in the treaty that weaken the court,
    including restrictions on the court's jurisdiction, and an &quot;opt-out&quot; clause that
    would allow states to put themselves beyond the court's reach on war crimes.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's a good thing to have an International Criminal Court,&quot; said Richard
    Dicker, who leads the ICC campaign for Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring
    organization based in New York. &quot;Of course this treaty has many serious weaknesses,
    and we'll be busy in the coming months trying to improve it. But this court is still
    better than no court.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Potential victims are safer with the establishment of this court,&quot; said Dicker.<br>
    <br>
    The ICC will prosecute and punish future acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and
    war crimes. A more detailed&nbsp; analysis of the treaty text is attached.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Text Analysis<br>
    International Criminal Court Treaty<br>
    July 17, 1998<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The following are some notable provisions of the ICC treaty, as adopted by the Rome
    conference.<br>
    <br>
    Crimes that the court can investigate and prosecute (Article 5) - the court has
    jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.&nbsp; Fortunately, the
    treaty does give the court jurisdiction over crimes commited in internal armed conflict -
    a provision strongly opposed by the Arab League states, China, and India. But the list of
    crimes for international war is much longer<br>
    than that for civil war. <br>
    <br>
    For example, the court can prosecute someone for indiscriminate attacks against civilians,
    the starvation of civilians, or the use of prohibited weapons such as biological weapons
    -- but only if those act are committed in a war between states, not a civil war. Since
    almost all conflicts today are &quot;non-international,&quot; this limits the scope of the
    court. Several of the definitions of crimes go back on existing international law. For
    example, it's well established that crimes against humanity have to be &quot;widespread
    and systematic.&quot; The treaty also requires that in addition, they must be committed as
    part of &quot;state, organization, or group policy.&quot; In an important victory, the
    court will be able to prosecute as a war crime the use of children under the age of 15 as
    soldiers, or to commit rape, sexual slavery, or enforced&nbsp; pregnancy in the context of
    war. Persecution on the basis of gender will be considered a crime against humanity and a
    war crime.&nbsp; The court will also have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression if and
    when a definition is decided upon in the future. U.S. strongly opposed including crimes of
    aggression in the treaty.<br>
    <br>
    Restrictions on the court's jurisdiction (Articles 12, and 111 bis) - A proposal that had
    won overwhelming support at the conference (the &quot;Korean proposal&quot;) allowed
    prosecutions to go forward if one out of four states had ratified the treaty: the state
    where the crimes took place, the state of the accused person's nationality, the state of
    the victim's nationality, and the state with custody of the accused. <br>
    <br>
    In the final version of the treaty, the court cannot act unless the state of nationality
    of the accused, or the state where the crimes took place, have ratified the treaty. In
    practice, those two are very likely to be the same state: Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Pinochet, and
    many others committed atrocities on their own populations. This provision will
    dramatically reduce the number of cases that the court can act upon. If the
    &quot;custodial state&quot; had been included, tyrantscould have been captured while
    traveling outside their own countries. Under this treaty, even a country that wants to
    turn over a suspect&nbsp; visiting its territory will have no legal basis to do so . If
    the state of nationality of the victim had beenincluded, a country could have submitted a
    case to the ICC if its citizens were victims of these serious crimes in another country.
    An example would be the Spaniards who were &quot;disappeared&quot; in Argentina in the
    1970's and 80's. Under this treaty, Spain would not have been able to file a suit on their
    behalf. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Opt-out&quot; for war crimes (Transitional Provision,Article 111 bis) - A major
    &nbsp; loophole, introduced at the eleventh hour by the permanent members of the Security
    Council, will allow ratifying states to declare that they &quot;opt out&quot; of the
    court's jurisdiction for war crimes for a period of seven years. States could not renew
    their &quot;opt out.&quot; It's still unclear whether this provision will remain
    permanently in the treaty, allowing any new member to &quot;opt out&quot; when it
    joins.This device incorporates impunity for war crimes into the founding document of a
    court that's been established to prosecute these crimes. That's illogical at best - and
    very damaging to the court's ability to function. We expect that militaries will put
    tremendous pressure on their governments to take this loophole. Human Rights Watch calls
    on states not to take advantage of the &quot;opt-out&quot; provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Independent prosecutor (Article 15) - This provisionallows the ICC prosecutor to undertake
    investigations on her own, subject to pre-trial approval by a panel of judges who will
    determine whether there is a reasonable basis for the investigations. The prosecutor can
    initiate the investigation based on information from victims, non-governmental
    organizations, or any other reliable source. The prosecutor and the judges will be
    selected by the states that have ratified the treaty. This proposal was highly
    controversial and staunchly opposed by the United States.&nbsp; Human Rights Watch
    considers its adoption to be a major victory, because national governments and the U.N.
    Security Council cannot be relied upon to bring matters to the court.<br>
    <br>
    Role of the U.N. Security Council (Article 16) - At one time, all five permanent members
    of the Security Council insisted that they should have a veto over the court's docket.
    That proposal didn't fly. Instead, the treaty includes the &quot;Singapore
    compromise,&quot; by which the Security Council may delay a prosecution for twelve months
    if it believes the ICC would interfere with the Council's efforts to further international
    peace and security. The Security Council must pass a resolution requesting the court not
    to proceed; an individual permanent member cannot block an investigation by exercising its
    veto. However, the Security Council can renew its request indefinitely, in twelve-month
    segments. This jeopardizes the court's independence, but the Singapore Compromise takes
    the veto away from individual permanent members. The Security Council can refer matters to
    thecourt, and when it does so, no state can block the ICC from proceeding - even states
    that don't ratify the treaty. <br>
    <br>
    Complementarity: (Articles 17, 18, 19) - These important provisions are at the heart of
    the relationship between the ICC and national judicial systems, and won wide agreement.
    The ICC will only be able to try cases when national courts have failed to work-where
    those court have acted in a way to shield the individual from criminal responsibility.
    This ensures that the ICC will only operate in the most exceptional circumstances, to fill
    the gap when national systems fail, not to substitute itself for national authorities. <br>
    <br>
    Criminal Law Provisions:&nbsp; (Articles 65, 66, 67, 68 andArticle 32 ) - In several
    important&nbsp; provisions, the treaty provides for full protection of the right of
    accused persons to a fair trial, and for the protection of victims and witnesses appearing
    before the Court.&nbsp; At the same time, Human Rights Watch is concerned that certain
    provisions represent a step back in international law. For example, the statute allows a
    limited right to assert the existence of orders from one's superior as a defense, although
    it has been clear since Nuremberg that such orders cannot be a defense for committing
    serious war crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Reparations for victims (Article 73) - In a major stepforward for victims of atrocities,
    the court has broad powers to order convicted persons to make reparations to vicitms.
    Those reparations can take financial or symbolic form. Individual victims are entitled to
    participate directly in the court's proceedings on reparations.<br>
    <br>
    Duties of states to cooperate with the court (Article90) - Since the ICC will have no
    police force, it's entirely dependent on states to investigate cases and transfer suspects
    to the court. The prosecutor has very limited power to conduct investigations - she <br>
    can't compel witnesses or carry out exhumations, for example.The treaty does require
    states to comply with thecourt's requests for cooperation. However, there are two major
    exceptions. First, as a result of U.S. and French insistence, the state may withhold
    information or prevent an individual from giving evidence if, in the state's view, it
    would prejudice national security interests. The U.S. proposal prevailed over one from the
    U.K., which would have allowed the court to order a state to disclose information, if it
    was acting in bad faith. Second, a very vague provision could allow states not to
    cooperate on the basis of inconsistency with their own &quot;fundamental national
    law,&quot; such as constitutional provisions. <br>
    <br>
    No Reservations&nbsp; (unnumbered article ) - In an important victory, the treaty does not
    allow reservations. This means that,&nbsp; unlike with other treaties, states cannot
    create loopholes to their obligations under the ICC treaty by simply declaring that
    certain articles don't apply to them - except for the war crimes &quot;opt-out&quot;
    mentioned above, which is incorporated into the body of the treaty&nbsp; itself.<br>
