    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 6 - Despite concerns voiced by the Clinton
    Administration about global warming, Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbit will announce
    today the opening of approximately 20 percent of Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve to
    new oil exploration. The entire Reserve encompasses a vast area of rolling foothills, wild
    rivers and extensive coastal plain wetlands that provide habitats for waterfowl, caribou,
    Arctic peregrine falcons, beluga whales, polar bears and other wildlife. <br>
    <br>
    Greenpeace opposes new oil development in Alaska, a region that continues to warm at a
    rate three times faster than the global average. The Greenpeace vessel m/v Arctic Sunrise
    is currently operating in Alaskan waters near the Reserve, working with scientists to
    document the impacts of global warming on the Arctic. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Only 25 percent of the known reserves of coal, oil and gas may be burned if hope to
    avert dangerous global warming,&quot; said Kalee Kreider, US Director of the Greenpeace
    Global Warming Campaign. &quot;Despite increasing White House rhetoric about the need for
    energy efficiency and clean renewable energy, it is clear that oil is still king and the
    President is a pawn,&quot; she continued. <br>
    <br>
    Although the amount of oil reserves in the area to be leased is unclear, the US government
    estimates that between approximately $500 million to $2.2 billion US dollars worth of oil
    is to be found in the area to be leased. The area also is believed to hold substantial
    reserves of coal and gas. <br>
    <br>
    The Reserve was closed to oil leasing until 1980 when Senator Ted Stevens attached a rider
    to a Department of Interior appropriations bill. The rider opened up the largest block of
    federally owned land in Alaska and provided that 50 percent of the royalties from any oil
    extracted go to the State of Alaska (rather than to federal coffers). <br>
    <br>
    A peer-reviewed report prepared by Industrial Economics and released by Greenpeace in June
    1998 estimated that oil companies operating in the US receive between $5 and $35 billion
    US dollars in subsidies each year. <br>
    <br>
    The last round of leasing held in the 1980's gave six oil companies the vast majority of
    leases: British Petroleum (BP), Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), Texaco, Chevron, Shell
    and Exxon.<p align="center">###</td>
