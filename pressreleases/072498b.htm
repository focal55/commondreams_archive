    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 24 - On July 23, for the second time in two days, the
    Senate refused to take action to protect children from guns, voting to table legislation
    that would hold adult gunowners legally responsible for locking up guns away from
    children. Just one day earlier, the Senate also tabled legislation that would require the
    inclusion of child safety locks with every handgun sold in the United States. According to
    an April 1998 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 75% of people surveyed support holding a
    gunowner criminally responsible if a child gains access to firearms and harms another
    person. An October 1997 Hearst poll showed that 86% of the American public supports
    including child safety locks with all guns sold.<br>
    <br>
    Suzann Wilson, the mother of Brittheny Varner who was killed in the Jonesboro schoolyard
    shooting, demanded to know why Senators would vote against such reasonable proposals. In
    the Jonesboro case, the two youths allegedly took three unsecured handguns from the home
    of one of the boys, after unsuccessfully attempting to blowtorch a gun safe. They then
    obtained rifles from an unlocked cabinet in the home of the boy&#146;s grandfather.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is insane,&quot; said Mrs. Wilson. &quot;How many more children have to die
    before Congress acts to protect our children from guns? I want answers, not excuses. Next
    week, Renee Brooks and I will go to Washington and we will ask to meet with Congressional
    leaders and every Senator who voted against these life-saving measures.&quot; Renee Brooks
    lost her 12-year-old daughter, Natalie, in the Jonesboro shooting.<br>
    <br>
    Both proposals were offered as amendments to the 1998 Commerce, State, and Justice
    Appropriations Bill. The child access prevention (CAP) amendment, sponsored by Sen. Dick
    Durbin (D-IL), was modeled after laws currently in effect in 16 states, which require
    firearms in the home to be locked up out of kids&#146; reach and impose criminal penalties
    on the gunowner if a child harms someone with an unsecured gun. Contrary to the claims
    made by Senator Larry Craig (R-ID), the proposal would not have imposed penalties on the
    gunowner if the gun was obtained by forced entry or break-in. An October 1997 study that
    appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that states which
    passed their own CAP laws experienced a 23% drop in unintentional firearm deaths of
    children aged 14 and younger.<br>
    <br>
    While the child safety lock amendment, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), was
    defeated, the Senate passed a meaningless alternative amendment, offered by Sen. Craig,
    which simply requires that gun dealers make gun locks available for sale -- something
    which most gun stores already do. Craig sits on the Board of the National Rifle
    Association.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How many more children must die in school shootings, unintentional shootings and
    impulse suicides in the home before our lawmakers will act?&quot; said Sarah Brady, chair
    of Handgun Control, Inc. &quot;Including child safety locks with every handgun sold is no
    different from including seat belts with every new car. If gunowners and gun manufacturers
    are not responsible for keeping guns out of the hands of children, then who is? I wonder
    if the Senators who voted against these two common-sense amendments have the courage to
    face Suzann Wilson and Renee Brooks and tell them why they won&#146;t protect children
    from guns.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    According to a 1997 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
    rate of firearm deaths among children 14 years old and under is nearly twelve times higher
    in the United States than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. The unintentional
    firearm-related death rate for children 0-14 years old is nine times higher in the U.S.
    than in the 25 other countries combined. The suicide rate for children 0-14 years old is
    twice as high in the U.S. than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. There is no
    difference in the nonfirearm suicide rate between the U.S. and the 25 other countries.
    Virtually all the difference is attributable to suicides being committed with guns in the
    U.S.<p align="center"># # #</p>
    <p>Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation&#146;s largest
    citizens&#146; gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to
    enact stronger federal, state and local gun control laws, but does not seek to ban
    handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with
    local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws.<br>
