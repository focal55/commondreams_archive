    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 7 - A crucial amendment to be offered this week by
    Sens. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is the last chance to
    keep the courts open for people who have been injured by guns or lost loved ones in
    shootings, the Violence Policy Center said today. The amendment would strip provisions
    from a broad product liability bill that would shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits by
    victims.<br>
    <br>
    VPC Director of Federal Policy Kristen Rand joined the senators and other gun control
    advocates to unveil the amendment at a 2 p.m. press conference in room 385 of the Russell
    Senate Building. Also attending the event was Steve Young of the Chicago-based HELP for<br>
    Survivors, whose son, Andrew, was shot and killed in Chicago two years ago when he was
    mistaken for a gang member. Young has joined a lawsuit against gun manufacturers by
    parents of murdered children.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Because the gun lobby has a stranglehold on Congress, the laws on health, safety,
    and consumer protection that apply to every other product don't apply to guns,&quot; Rand
    said. &quot;The courtroom is the only place left to get compensation for victims of gun
    violence and make the gun industry accountable for its conduct. The Torricelli-Feinstein
    Amendment preserves this last chance for justice.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The product liability bill is the result of a compromise between its Senate sponsors and
    the White House. If the Senate passes the legislation, it is expected to be approved by
    the House and signed by the President this year. The Torricelli-Feinstein Amendment would
    maintain the gun industry's legal responsibility by excluding guns from the bill's reach.
    The legislation already includes a similar exemption for tobacco. Early whip counts on the
    amendment project a very close vote.<br>
    <br>
    Last week, the VPC released a report, &quot;Small Favors,&quot; which exposes how the
    bill's protection for &quot;small businesses&quot; would apply to many notorious gun
    manufacturers that each produce thousands of firearms every year. The report provides
    background on a sampling of these companies, including their production figures and
    pictures of their weapons.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Most Americans think of a small business as Mom and Pop's candy store, not Davis
    Industries, which churns out anywhere from 50,000 to 175,000 Saturday Night Specials in
    one year,&quot; Rand said.<br>
    <br>
    Davis Industries is one of many companies specializing in Saturday Night Specials which
    would be protected as a &quot;small business.&quot; Other beneficiaries of the &quot;small
    favor&quot; include the manufacturers of guns with documented safety defects and the
    makers of such infamous guns as the AK-47, the TEC-9, and the Street Sweeper.<br>
    <br>
    In its current form, the bill limits punitive damages against any &quot;small
    business&quot; to a paltry $250,000. Other provisions of the proposed legislation would:<br>
    <br>
    -- Protect gun sellers as well as manufacturers, even in cases when they market guns to
    criminals or children.<br>
    -- Raise the standard for punitive damages, making it much easier for gun manufacturers to
    avoid punishment for reckless business practices such as making defective or unsafe guns
    or carelessly distributing guns so that children and criminals have easy access to them.<br>
    -- Bar cutting-edge legal theories now being tested in a sprinkling of lawsuits across the
    country against gun manufacturers.<br>
    <br>
    These restrictions would obliterate the new wave of lawsuits against the gun industry,
    which are modeled on the successful litigation against tobacco companies. Around the
    country, gun victims, gun control advocates, and mayors are pursuing potential cases. The
    mayors of both Philadelphia and Chicago have announced that they are now considering
    filing lawsuits against the industry.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The gun lobby sees how the tobacco industry has been devastated by litigation over
    its dangerous products and shady practices,&quot; Rand said. &quot;Gun manufacturers want
    to slam the courthouse door before they meet the same fate.&quot;<br>
