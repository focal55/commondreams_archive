    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 30 - A new poll released today by HRC and conducted by
    the&nbsp; polling firm Penn, Schoen, and Berland shows that dire political
    &nbsp; consequences await the GOP if they continue down their current path of
    &nbsp; anti-gay rhetoric and discriminatory legislation against gay Americans,
    &nbsp; according to the Human Rights Campaign.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The vast majority of Americans are
    appalled by the recent anti-gay&nbsp; crusade waged by the Right-wing.&nbsp; This poll
    shows that politicians who once&nbsp; thought they benefitted from attacking gays may be
    in for a rude awakening in November.&nbsp; America has drawn a line in the sand that says
    that job discrimination and singling out one group of Americans is morally and <br>
    politically unacceptable,&quot; said HRC communications director and senior strategist
    David M. Smith. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poll results show that Americans
    overwhelmingly oppose the Hefley amendment, which would reverse President Clinton's
    executive order banning discrimination against gay men and women in federal employment.
    &nbsp; 64 percent of Americans said they are against Congress overturning the executive
    order, compared to only 28 percent who support overturning the discrimination ban.
    &nbsp; The Hefley amendment is expected to be introduced this <br>
    week to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Members of Congress who vote for the
    Hefley amendment are clearly out of touch with the American people.&nbsp; Those who choose
    to support this amendment are branding themselves with a big scarlet letter that screams,
    `I am intolerant.'&nbsp; Our poll shows that there are grave consequences for members of
    Congress who align themselves with religious political extremists,&quot; said HRC
    political director Winnie Stachelberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the findings in today's poll is
    that 75 percent of Americans believe job discrimination against gay people should be
    illegal.&nbsp; The poll also shows that there are political consequences for gay bashing
    with 48 percent of likely voters saying that they would be &quot;less likely&quot; to vote
    for a Congressperson who voted to overturn President Clinton's ban barring job
    discrimination against gays.&nbsp; Only 17 percent of respondents said overturning the
    discrimination ban would make them &quot;more likely&quot; to vote for their
    Congressperson.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poll also asked how the recent attacks on
    gay Americans by the GOP affected the respondents opinion of the Republican party.
    &nbsp; 40 percent said their opinion was &quot;less favorable.&quot;&nbsp; Only 18 percent
    said anti-gay rhetoric made their impression of the party &quot;more favorable.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the poll, Americans overwhelming
    believe the recent anti-gay rhetoric, such as Senate Majority leader Trent Lott's
    comparison of gay people to kleptomaniacs is divisive.&nbsp; 62 percent said they believe
    that the recent public &quot;discussion&quot; on the equality of gay Americans hurts the
    country and fosters a climate of intolerance and hostility, while just 24 percent of say
    it helps the country. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Voters are perplexed by this new
    obsession with gay people and are wondering when Congress will realize it is time to start
    focusing on real issues instead of red-meat for the Far Right&quot; Smith.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to appease Focus On The
    Family's James Dobson and his political deputy Gary Bauer,&nbsp; Senate Majority Leader
    Trent Lott kicked off a wave of anti-gay rhetoric when he recently said that homosexuality
    was a sin and likened gays to alcoholics and kleptomaniacs. His comments were followed by
    disparaging remarks about gay people by several public officials including Senator Don
    Nickles (R-Okla.), Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX.) and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)&nbsp; These
    attacks intensified after fifteen religious&nbsp; political organizations embarked on a
    divisive ad campaign targeting gay Americans and their family members.&nbsp; This
    orchestrated campaign of discrimination has now spread to the House where a plethora of
    anti-gay legislation has been introduced.&nbsp; Last night, the House narrowly passed two
    amendments to the VA/HUD appropriations bill that have grave implications for gay
    Americans. The Hilleary amendment, which passed by a vote of 231-230, would drastically
    cut housing funds for people with AIDS.&nbsp; The Riggs amendment, which passed by a vote
    of 214-212, would prohibit San Francisco from using VA-HUD funds to implement its city
    ordinance against discrimination in city contracts.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the largest
    national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country. It
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community. <p align="center">- 30 -</td>
