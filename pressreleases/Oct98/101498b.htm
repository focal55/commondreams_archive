    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 14 - Inside the Beltway, while the media and politicians are preoccupied with the
    latest version of sex, lies and videotape, the real scandal is the assault by the
    ultra-conservatives on women and our families. Using Zippergate as a smokescreen to
    distract voters, the Gingrich-led Congress is passing laws that hurt women and working to
    increase their stranglehold on power. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">And while the
    Republicans in Washington, D.C. accelerate their partisan game of chicken, heedless of
    whether the government crashes, religious political extremists in Colorado and other
    states are working to pass ballot measures that will turn back the clock for women. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.now.org/pac/">NOW PAC</a>s' <i>Women's
    Votes Count Campaign</i> is here today to sound the alarm and to help turn out our vote
    this November 3. We must not allow reactionary forces to make further gains as a result of
    women voters' disillusionment. If disgust with the current crisis depresses women's votes,
    we will face a Congress even more hostile to feminist issues and a roll-back of
    reproductive rights in this state. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We must send Dottie Lamm to the U.S. Senate with
    reinforcements both in the House and here in Colorado. Women must also get out the vote to
    elect Gail Schoettler governor and to defeat the onerous anti-abortion rights measures on
    the Colorado ballot. We have too much at stake in this year's elections to stay home. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By only three votes the U.S. Senate sustained the
    president's veto of an unconstitutional abortion procedure ban like the one on the ballot
    here. And the radical right wing is working overtime to eliminate those three votes.
    &nbsp; NOW PACs' <i>Women's Votes Count Campaign</i> will fight hard to reelect the women
    we sent to Washington in 1992 -- Barbara Boxer, Carol Moseley-Braun and Patty Murray --
    and to add Dottie Lamm to their ranks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The same people who have targeted Dottie Lamm and Gail
    Schoettler for defeat and launched attacks on abortion rights are also working hard to
    elect more &quot;stealth&quot; candidates -- who try to pass themselves off as moderates
    when, in fact, they are right-wing ideologues. We will be working even harder to increase
    the margin of victory for candidates who support reproductive freedom and other issues
    that affect women, our families and our communities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the wake of Zippergate, women's progress is indeed at
    risk -- less from the president's appalling behavior than from the impact of this scandal
    on electoral politics in 1998 and beyond.&nbsp; The obsessive focus of pols and pundits on
    White House scandals threatens to eclipse the campaigns of feminist candidates and the
    fight to preserve abortion rights. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Women's Votes Count Campaign</i> is organizing
    activists across the nation to elect candidates at all levels who will support women's
    equality.&nbsp; We will defeat the anti-choice ballot measures.&nbsp; And we will fill the
    pipelines with feminists who will take back the Congress and the country.&nbsp; Through
    this national campaign, we are moving from trying to influence people in power toward
    becoming the people in power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I challenge every progressive person in Colorado to get out
    and vote on November 3, and to work in these critical last three weeks to elect feminists
    and to defeat the anti-abortion rights ballot measures. Your work and your vote are the
    only way to put an end to the keyhole peeping by the House Judiciary Committee and to stop
    the attacks on our rights in this state and in Congress. Women have been counted in the
    endless array of opinion polls.&nbsp; Now it's time to be heard in the only poll that
    really counts -- the voting booth. </font></p>
