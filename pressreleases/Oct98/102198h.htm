    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 21 - After months of debate and several Continuing Resolutions to keep the
    government open, the 105th Congress sent an omnibus bill to President Clinton today as its
    final budget package. Thanks to the committed efforts of our nationwide army of advocates,
    many of the appropriation bills, which had originally included amendments harmful to
    women, emerged without their punitive restrictions.<br>
    <br>
    </font><blockquote>
      <p><font face="arial" size="2">&quot;We made one giant step forward in that female federal
      employees will now have the benefit of contraceptive coverage in health plans. This lays a
      solid foundation for Congress to approve legislation in the next session to require
      contraceptive coverage by all private insurance plans,&quot; said Gloria Feldt, president,
      Planned Parenthood Action Fund.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The behind-the-scenes struggle, however, to keep this measure in the final bill was
      extraordinary -- even though there was broad, bi-partisan support. And the fight for
      reproductive rights is only going to get tougher unless Americans are fully aware of whom
      they are voting for this November and where those candidates stand on family planning and
      choice issues.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    Since an anti-choice majority claimed the House in 1995, Congress has voted nearly 100
    times to eliminate or restrict access to family planning and reproductive choice. Attempts
    by the 105th Congress to continue this strategy included the following: <br>
    <br>
    - Amending the Agriculture Appropriations Bill to block the FDA from conducting scientific
    inquiry or approving any drug that induces abortion, such as mifepristone (RU-486).<br>
    <br>
    - Stripping a provision from the Treasury-Postal bill after broad, bi-partisan approval
    that would require federal employee health plans that cover prescription drugs to also
    cover contraceptives; the provision was later included in the final bill.<br>
    <br>
    - Attempting to pass the so-called &quot;Child Custody Protection Act,&quot; which would
    have endangered teens by making it a federal crime for anyone but a parent to accompany a
    minor across state lines to obtain abortion services in violation of her home state's
    parental consent law.<br>
    <br>
    - Imposing a &quot;global gag rule&quot; on international family planning agencies
    receiving federal funding by restricting free speech about abortion in their own countries
    and paid for with their own monies - activities which are constitutionally protected in
    the U.S.<br>
    <br>
    - Placing millions of teens at risk by requiring parental consent for minors seeking
    family planning from federally funded clinics.<br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="arial" size="2">&quot;Let us be very clear, &quot; said Feldt, &quot;none
      of these measures were designed to improve the health of women. Since Roe v. Wade
      established a woman's right to abortion 25 years ago, we have seen attacks on our
      reproductive freedom everywhere from local school boards to state legislatures to the
      Supreme Court - as well as at our clinics. And for 82 years, Planned Parenthood has stood
      up to those public attacks to support its original mission &#133; that every child should
      be a wanted child. With women able to control their fertility, they can participate more
      fully as decision-makers in our society; this is clearly a threat to certain members of
      Congress and the fringe groups that support them.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    While many of the potentially harmful amendments were not included in the final omnibus
    bill, there was only one advance: requiring contraceptive coverage for female federal
    employees. Otherwise, Congress continued its ban of almost all abortion services for
    low-income women, Native American women, military women overseas, women in federal
    prisons, and female federal employees.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When will logic prevail over politics? When will those opposed to abortion embrace
    the elementary concept of making contraception more available and affordable? If the
    Congressional leadership continues its crusade to block all forms of abortion and still
    does nothing to promote family planning, then American voters must hold them accountable. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="arial" size="2">&quot;It isn't the role of the government to turn personal,
      medical matters into political issues. But the 105th Congress has made the voting booth as
      vital as a family planning clinic if we want to ensure access to reproductive health
      care,&quot; said Feldt. &quot;Millions of women come to Planned Parenthood clinics so that
      they can make responsible choices about their reproductive health. It is more important
      than ever that voters elect a Congress that we can trust to make responsible choices about
      legislation that helps, not hurts, women and their reproductive health.&quot; </font></p>
