    In Support Of US Citizen Suing Los Angeles County For Torture</strong></font></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 20 - The shocking of a defendant with an electric stun belt in a California court
    constituted torture under international law, Amnesty International said today. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The human rights organization has filed a special petition in
    support of a law suit brought by Ronnie Hawkins, a black US citizen who was punished with
    a 50,000-volt electric discharge during a court hearing in June 1998. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After repeated verbal interruptions by Ronnie Hawkins, the
    California judge handling the proceedings ordered a guard to activate the stun belt the
    defendant had been made to wear while in court. The belt -- which a guard can activate at
    the push of a button -- inflicts a huge electric current, causing severe pain and instant
    incapacitation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Amnesty International petition follows a motion to
    dismiss the case filed by Los Angeles county. According to Amnesty International the
    motion to dismiss displays a fundamental ignorance of the most basic principles of
    international human rights law and its application in the United States. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The deliberate infliction of pain as a punishment, by
    or at the instigation of a public official, falls clearly within the definition of
    torture,&quot; said Pierre Sané, Amnesty International's Secretary General, currently
    touring the United States as part of a year-long campaign to promote human rights in the
    country. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Even without activation, the fear of being subjected
    to severe pain while in a totally powerless position, is a key element of the mental
    suffering of a victim of torture,&quot; stressed Mr Sané, adding that &quot;the
    international prohibition against torture is universal, and the use of a stun belt in Mr
    Hawkins' case is a violation of international law binding in the USA, the State of
    California and the County of Los Angeles.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International has therefore asked the Central
    District of California's District Court to enforce this fundamental international norm.
    The petition came in the form of an amicus brief -- an independent expert opinion --
    submitted today to the Court by attorney Paul Hoffman, working on behalf of the human
    rights organization. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The petition states that at the time the punishment was
    inflicted, Ronnie Hawkins posed no physical threat to himself or anyone else in the
    courtroom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mr Hawkins says that the electric discharge caused him to
    be tortured, and caused him great physical and mental pain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There is no doubt that Ronnie Hawkins&#146;
    allegations, and the factual circumstances of this case, state a claim of torture under
    international law,&quot; Mr Sané stressed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Additional information</b><br>
    The motion to dismiss filed by the County of Los Angeles states that a foreign protest is
    required prior to a litigant being able to invoke international law in US courts. Amnesty
    International strongly refutes this, since the number of cases which have recognized the
    application of international law despite the absence of any foreign protest is simply too
    great to catalogue. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In its most significant decision regarding the role of
    international law in the United States (in the case of &quot;Paquete Habana&quot;), the US
    Supreme Court noted that international law is part of US law, and must be ascertained and
    administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction. The Court did not find
    it relevant to determine whether a foreign protest had been issued in the case at hand in
    order to apply international law in the United States. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">International human rights law is based on the principle
    that all persons are entitled to basic human rights protections vis-a-vis their own
    government &#150; and that includes US citizens. The argument by the County of Los Angeles
    about the need for a foreign government to protest is entirely nonsensical in the context
    of a claim by a US citizen against his own government. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Article 1 of the UN Convention Against Torture defines
    torture as &quot;any act by which sever pain of suffering, whether physical or mental, is
    intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as ...punishing him for an act he
    ... has committed... or intimidating or coercing him ... when such pain or suffering is
    inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public
    official or other person acting in an official capacity&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Remote-controlled electro-shock stun belts have been
    introduced by prison or jail authorities in more than 20 US states in recent years.
    Amnesty International considers that their use constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading
    treatment or punishment, and has called for a total ban on their use. </font></p>
