    October 27 - In the election year following several schoolyard shootings that horrified
    the nation, Handgun Control, Inc.&#146;s Voter Education Fund today released its
    &quot;Dangerous Dozen&quot; list of 11 candidates for the United States Senate, U.S. House
    of Representatives, and state governorships whose election or re-election could make the
    difference between common-sense gun laws and laws that make it easy for children and
    criminals to get guns. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;These are the
    candidates who call the NRA before they write their campaign speeches about the Second
    Amendment,&quot; said Sarah Brady, HCI&#146;s chair.&nbsp; &quot;Their records on assault
    weapons, the Brady Bill, child access prevention laws and other common-sense measures to
    protect Americans from firearm violence and unintentional shootings demonstrate their
    complete indifference to public safety.&nbsp; Fortunately, the outcome of many of these
    races may turn on the candidates&#146; positions on gun control.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the first time, the &quot;Dangerous Dozen&quot;
    includes a non-candidate &#150; Charlton Heston&#146;s and the NRA&#146;s opposition to
    Florida ballot initiative Revision 12.&nbsp; Revision 12 proposes to close the dangerous
    loophole through which so-called &quot;private collectors&quot; sell -- and criminals
    purchase -- weapons at gun shows without waiting periods or background checks, by allowing
    Florida counties to impose those requirements on all gun-sellers.&nbsp; Just today, the
    NRA began airing misleading radio ads in which they make the preposterous claim that
    Revision 12 would &quot;reduce&quot; criminal penalties for illegal gun sales in Florida! </font></p>
