    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 28 -&nbsp; Each day, worldwide, close
    to one billion people suffer from hunger. The availability of enough food to feed
    burgeoning populations, and the maintenance of stable economies are constant concerns for
    most countries. These concerns are addressed in the new report <i>Cultivating Diversity:
    Agrobiodiversity and Food Security</i> released by the World Resources Institute, which
    highlights the key principles, policies and practices necessary to maintaining
    agrobiodiversity and to assuring long-term food security. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Cultivating Diversity</i>, written by Dr. Lori Ann
    Thrupp, presents a comprehensive synthesis of the ecological basis and economic value of
    biodiversity, and documents the trends of agrobiodiversity erosion worldwide and
    identifies the root causes of such losses. The report notes that biodiversity is a
    fundamental basis of food security and agricultural productivity globally, and describes
    how humanity has benefited from a great diversity of biological resources crucial to
    nutrition and survival and essential for innovations in food production technologies.
    Agrobiodiversity consists of a rich basket of resources -- ranging from varieties of crops
    and livestock, to beneficial insects, microscopic organisms, and genetic materials -- that
    make up healthy soils and enable production of nutritious food. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet, Thrupp warns, under current patterns of development
    globally, valuable agricultural biodiversity is being seriously jeopardized and lost. This
    deterioration is threatening food security in many parts of the world and is aggravating
    hunger for many people. Thrupp explains that &quot;changes are urgently needed to overcome
    the serious threats from erosion of genetic resources and agrobiodiversity,&quot; and, she
    adds, &quot;if [these changes] are not undertaken, the world's food supply will continue
    to be seriously jeopardized, and people's suffering from hunger will only worsen.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As such, <i>Cultivating Diversity</i> outlines
    agrobiodiversity-friendly policies and best-practice recommendations for international
    agencies, national institutions, NGOs, and farmers. These recommendations provide
    &quot;win-win&quot; solutions to the multiple challenges of achieving long-term food
    security, building economic productivity, and maintaining healthy ecosystems. These
    recommendations, directed to decision-makers in international institutions, agricultural
    ministries, resource managers, farmers, and private enterprises note that they should: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Develop policies and institutional changes that support
        agrobiodiversity, ensure food security, and protect farmers' rights, and eliminate
        policies that promote uniform monocultural systems. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Adapt agricultural practices and land use to local
        agroecological and socioeconomic conditions adjusted to local diverse needs and
        aspirations, and building upon local successful experiences. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Empower farmers and communities to protect their rights to
        resources, support their knowledge and cultural diversity, and ensure their participation
        in decision-making and conservation. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Support sustainable ecological agriculture that includes the
        goals of food security, social equity and health, economic productivity, and ecological
        integrity as a framework for enhancing agrobiodiversity. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Develop an ecosystems approach, using agroecology as a
        guiding scientific paradigm, to support and validate the sustainable use and enhancement
        of agrobiodiversity. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the report explains that lessons from experience
    show that practices and approaches to enhance agrobiodiversity pay off for large- and
    small-scale farmers; they also serve the interests of food security and conservation,
    which benefit the broader public. As Thrupp says: &quot;If appropriate reforms are made in
    policies concerning intellectual property rights, they also can contribute to broad social
    interests. In sum, policies and actions to support agrobiodiversity at many levels are
    needed, and will lead to multidimensional economic and ecological gains in both the short
    term and the long term.&quot; </font></p>
