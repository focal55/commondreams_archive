    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">GENEVA - October 7
    - In <a href="http://www.hrw.org/hrw/reports98/thai/thai.htm">a report issued today</a>,
    Human Rights Watch criticized the Royal Thai Government and the United Nations High
    Commissioner for Refugees for failing to give adequate protection to the more than 100,000
    Burmese refugees in Thailand. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the new report,
    &quot;<a href="http://www.hrw.org/hrw/reports98/thai/thai.htm">Unwanted and Unprotected:
    Burmese Refugees in Thailand</a>,&quot; Human Rights Watch said that even with the May
    1998 agreement formalizing working arrangements between Thailand and UNHCR, significant
    gaps in refugee protection remained. Burmese refugees in Thailand will continue to be in
    danger, the organization said, until UNHCR has full and unimpeded access to all Burmese
    refugees in Thailand, is able to conduct screening of newly arrived asylum-seekers, and
    has guarantees that repatriation will take place only when human rights conditions in
    Burma are conducive to return. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report says the danger to refugees has been exacerbated
    by the fact that Thailand is among the hardest hit of the countries struck by the Asian
    economic crisis. In its efforts to deport undocumented migrant workers, of whom Burmese
    are the overwhelming majority, the Thai government makes little distinction between
    refugees and migrants. Because of the lack of effective refugee status determination
    procedures, it may be deporting people with a valid claim to refugee status, if only they
    had the opportunity to assert it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch identifies part of the problem as
    stemming from Thailand's failure to ratify the United Nations Convention relating to the
    Status of Refugees, the treaty that establishes the legal regime for refugee protection,
    and calls on the Royal Thai Government to immediately become party to that treaty. It
    calls for the immediate cessation of the Thai practice, in effect since June, of closing
    its borders to new asylum seekers. Rejection at the border of those with a well-founded
    fear of persecution is a violation of Thailands's obligations under international law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Part of the problem also lies with UNHCR. While
    acknowledging the constraints the agency faces because of its need to maintain relations
    with Thailand, Human Rights Watch says UNCHR &quot;has been unnecessarily weak in its
    efforts to challenge the Thai policies that undermine refugee protection.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch is particularly critical of the Burmese
    government, whose policies are ultimately responsible for the influx of refugees into
    Thailand. It notes the role that Burmese government policies of forced labor and forced
    displacement have played in the exodus of Burmese to Thailand. Human Rights Watch urges
    the government to comply with the U.N. Commission on Human Rights resolution of April 20,
    1998, which calls on the government in Rangoon to address specific human rights concerns
    and create the conditions that would enable refugees to return. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new report is based on Human Rights Watch research
    conducted since 1988. It examines the factors affecting Thai policy, including its
    experience with Indochinese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s, and the changing relations
    betweeen Thailand and Burma. It profiles the two major groups of refugees from Burma: the
    &quot;students&quot; -- a catch-all phrase to denote the mostly urban students and
    professional who took part in the 1988 uprising and subsequent political protests, and
    members of the different ethnic minority groups living close to the Thai border, who have
    fled armed conflict, forced displacement, forced labor, and other abuses. Those groups
    include the Karen, the Karenni, the Mon, and the Shan in particular.</font></p>
