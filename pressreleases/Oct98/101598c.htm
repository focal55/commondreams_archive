    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 15 - The following was released today by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under the guise of religious compassion, the Christian Right is
    intensifying its anti-gay campaign at a time when hate crimes against lesbians and gay men
    -- like the fatal assault on 22-year-old Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard -- are
    still pervasive, a new study shows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The so-called &quot;ex-gay&quot; movement, now being touted
    in television ads across the country, asserts that people can be &quot;converted&quot; to
    heterosexuality be embracing Fundamentalist Christian doctrine or through &quot;reparative
    therapy.&quot; These claims have been rejected by the medical community and repudiated by
    most national religious organizations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ex-gay movement &quot;provides political cover for a
    significant new phase of the Christian Right's long-running anti-gay
    campaign,&quot;according to the report &quot;Calculated Compassion: How the Ex-Gay
    Movement Serves the Right's Attack on Democracy.&quot; The three-year study is the first
    comprehensive examination of the political role of this movement. It was commissioned by
    the Boston-based research center Political Research Associates (PRA), the Policy Institute
    of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C., and Equal Partners in
    Faith, a national network of religious leaders.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Christian Right has been under pressure to soften
    its homophobic rhetoric,&quot; said Surina Khan, author of the report and a PRA research
    analyst. &quot;The ex-gay movement provides a 'kinder,gentler' camouflage for pursuing its
    political objectives. It's no coincidence that this movement and its message are being
    strenuously promoted in the run-up to the elections.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report provides evidence that &quot;most mainstream
    religious leaders and religious organizations...do not share the views of the ex-gay
    movement about homosexuality.&quot; The Family Research Council,the Christian Coalition
    and other promoters of the ex-gay movement assert that homosexuality is a &quot;sin to be
    overcome,&quot; said Khan. That view not only allows that gay people are denied
    constitutional rights on religious grounds, she said. It contradicts the beliefs of most
    communities of faith in the country, including the Roman Catholic Church, the National
    Council of Churches, and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report reiterates that the ex-gay movement, while
    posing as a religious-based initiative is part of a wider political assault on the civil
    rights of the gay community. &quot;The Christian Right's message about ex-gay conversion
    echoes the sentiment of our political adversaries,&quot; said Kerry Lobel, executive
    director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. &quot;We have already seen a chorus
    of anti-gay rhetoric in Congress, as well as the alarming persistence of anti-gay hate
    crimes. The fundamentalists have forged an alliance with those in Congress and other
    elected offices bent on denying constitutional rights to this segment of the
    population.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Rev. Meg Riley, co-chair of Equal Partners in Faith,
    said religious leaders have not spoken out enough in defense of pluralism and tolerance in
    recent years. &quot;The ex-gay movement has gone largely unchallenged in many faith
    communities, giving the Christian right a powerful vehicle for justifying discrimination
    in the name of religion.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report also documents that the ex-gay movement is
    devoid of reputable scholarship. Major professional institutions including the American
    Psychological Association (APA) and the American Medical Association have long rejected
    the notion that lesbians and gay men can be &quot;cured.&quot; Homosexuality was removed
    from the APA's official list of emotional and mental disorders 25 years ago.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Rev. Ken Brooker Langston of Equal Partners in Faith
    worries that the ex-gay movement will lead to &quot;intolerance in the name of compassion.
    We are particularly concerned that young people will be influenced by an idea that is not
    only bad science but bogus theology,&quot; he said. &quot;The faith community is no place
    to promote discrimination of any kind.&quot;</font></p>
