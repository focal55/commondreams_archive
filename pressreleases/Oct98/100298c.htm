    Ads Implore Congress To Put Social Security First</font></strong></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 2 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">New television and radio ads beginning
    this afternoon will up the pressure on Congress to use the federal budget surplus -- which
    would not exist without the Social Security Trust Fund -- for no purpose other than
    strengthening Social Security. The ads are part of an escalating campaign by the 13
    million member AFL-CIO to strengthen retirement security for Americans and oppose efforts
    to dismantle Social Security.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last week the House of Representatives voted, largely along
    party lines for a plan by Speaker Newt Gingrich to use the surplus for an $80 billion
    election year tax cut. The proposal moves to the Senate next week, where it faces serious
    opposition. If, approved by the Senate, it will go back to the House for a final vote
    before being sent to the President.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ads, running all over the country, point to the House
    vote and ask viewers to call lawmakers and urge them to &quot;put Social Security
    first.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Congress should save every dollar of the budget
    surplus to strengthen Social Security, the most successful domestic program in our nation&#146;s
    history. Working families need elected officials to stand up for our long term security --
    not sell out for today&#146;s electioneering,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A July poll conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates
    concludes that the overwhelming majority of Americans, when offered a choice between using
    the current federal budget surplus to strengthen Social Security or provide tax cuts, say
    it is more important to shore up Social Security for the long haul.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the Congressional Budget Office, if you take
    the Social Security Trust Fund out of the budget equation, the federal budget will not
    come into balance until 2002, and a real budget surplus will not materialize until 2005. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Social Security accounts for 98% of the projected budget
    surpluses over the next 10 years. Looking at the next five years, the rest of the
    government is running a deficit of $137 billion over the next 5 years. Without Social
    Security, there is no surplus to finance Republican tax giveaways.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Social Security is the one leg of the retirement
    income stool that actually works for the overwhelming majority of American families,
    allowing them to enjoy retirement in dignity and independence. The other two legs of the
    stool -- pensions and savings -- are already shaky,&quot; Sweeney added.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The AFL-CIO campaign aims to educate and mobilize working
    families in an all-out effort to strengthen Social Security and stop privatization schemes
    that would undermine workers&#146; retirement security. Trainings and workshops are taking
    place at union federation conventions, worksites and union halls, teach-ins, and at town
    hall meetings all across the country to make working families&#146; voice heard in the
    nation&#146;s debate on Social Security.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just yesterday, the AFL-CIO&#146;s Working Women&#146;s
    Department announced that they will sponsor regional town hall meetings on Social Security
    reform and women. The first two will take place in Milwaukee on October 8 and Miami on
    October 19. Two more will be held in November.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson,
    AFL-CIO Working Women&#146;s Director Karen Nussbaum, representatives from the Social
    Security Administration and members of Congress will join local women union leaders and
    community activists on a panel to discuss the current debate over how to strengthen the
    Social Security system, the effects of privatization on working women, and how working
    women can take action to push for the right kind of change.</font></p>
