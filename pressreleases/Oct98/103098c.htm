    October 30 - <font color="#003300">New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial today announced that the
    City of New Orleans has filed the first-ever lawsuit by a city or other government against
    the gun industry.&nbsp; The suit names fifteen gun manufacturers, three trade associations
    and several local pawnshops and gun dealers, and seeks to recover the damage to the City
    from the gun industry&#146;s sale of guns that are not &quot;personalized&quot; to
    incorporate safety designs to prevent their use by children and other unauthorized users.
    &nbsp; The Legal Action Project of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, which for five
    years has been bringing innovative lawsuits against the gun industry, has agreed to serve
    as co-counsel for the City&#146;s lawsuit.&nbsp; Lousiana attorney Wendell H. Gauthier, an
    architect of the legal strategy used against the tobacco industry, will also represent the
    City in its suit.</font> </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#003300">&quot;We
    have been so focused here in New Orleans on fighting crime, getting guns off the street
    and protecting our citizens,&quot; said Mayor Morial.&nbsp; &quot;We have already reduced
    crime in New Orleans by 40% since 1994.&nbsp; This lawsuit is the next step in making New
    Orleans the safest city in America.&quot;</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#003300">&quot;This lawsuit is a turning point
    in our efforts to force the gun industry to make a safer, childproof, &#145;personalized&#146;
    product,&quot; said Dennis Henigan, Director of the Center&#146;s Legal Action Project and
    a national expert on the application of product liability law to the firearms industry.
    &nbsp; &quot;Mayor Morial is showing great courage in becoming the first mayor to take the
    gun industry to court, and we expect that other big-city mayors may well follow his lead.
    &nbsp; It&#146;s time for the gun industry to be held accountable for the cost of the
    thousands of tragedies and millions of dollars gun violence inflicts on our nation&#146;s
    cities.&quot;</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#003300">&nbsp;This year, several urban mayors
    including Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia, Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County, and
    Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago have expressed interest in following the tobacco example in
    recovering costs from the gun industry.&nbsp; In the last six months, the gun industry&#146;s
    most powerful trade group, the American Shooting Sports Council, has repeatedly met with
    big-city mayors to deny responsibility for the design of its manufacturers&#146; products
    in an attempt to ward off the type of lawsuit now filed by New Orleans.&nbsp; The American
    Shooting Sports Council is named as a defendant in the New Orleans lawsuit, along with
    leading gun manufacturers including Smith &amp; Wesson, Sturm Ruger, Beretta U.S.A., Colt,
    Glock, Lorcin, Bryco, Jennings and Navegar.</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#003300">&quot;The gun industry has hid behind
    its mouthpieces at the NRA for many years, but those days are now over,&quot; Henigan
    said.&nbsp; &quot;The money that manufacturers spent on pro-gun propaganda and misleading
    advertising could have been used to make guns that can only be fired by authorized owners,
    sparing us thousands of homicides, suicides and accidents.&quot;</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#003300">&quot;Under the Louisiana product
    liability statute, a manufacturer can be held liable for damage caused by a product that
    is unreasonably dangerous in design.&nbsp; In this lawsuit, the City is alleging that guns
    that fail to incorporate safety systems that prevent their use by children and other
    unauthorized users are unreasonably dangerous in design.&nbsp; Just as car manufacturers
    have been held liable for failing to install seat belts and air bags, gun makers should be
    liable for failing to install feasible safety systems to prevent serious injuries and
    deaths.&quot;</font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#003300">Coincidentally, Center attorneys are
    also in trial in Oakland, CA representing the parents of a child accidentally killed by a
    gun that lacked any safety features that could have prevented the accident.&nbsp; In Dix
    v. Beretta, the Center&#146;s lawyers ask that Beretta U.S.A. be held responsible for the
    death of Kenzo Dix, who was killed by a close friend who believed he had unloaded the gun
    he had found. Kenzo was killed by a bullet that remained in the gun&#146;s chamber, and
    the Center is asking for damages for failing to implement feasible design changes that
    would have prevented the gun from being fired by children.&nbsp; The Dix case is expected
    to go to the jury in early November.</font> </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#003300" face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Why should the
    innocent citizens of this City, or any other city, bear the costs of gun violence while
    the gun industry pays nothing?&quot; Henigan said.&nbsp; &quot;No longer must it be
    permitted to evade its share of the responsibility for protecting our communities and
    particularly our children from senseless shootings.&nbsp; Mayor Morial today has filed a
    lawsuit to save lives.&nbsp; We are all indebted to him.&quot;</font></p>

    Prevent Handgun Violence, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1983 to reduce gun

    prevention programs for parents and youth on the risks associated with guns, legal
    representation for gun violence victims, work with the entertainment community to
    encourage deglamorization of guns in the media, and research of the risks associated with
    guns and the efficacy of gun control laws</font>. </em></font></td>
