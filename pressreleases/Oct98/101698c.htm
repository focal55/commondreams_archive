    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 16 - Gun shows have armed some our nation&#146;s most notorious criminals. In a
    news conference today hosted by Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI), James Brady, U.S.
    Representative Rod Blagojevich (D-IL), and Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas unveiled
    the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; of gun show purchasers. Criminals who have earned this dubious
    distinction include the likes of David Koresh, Timothy McVeigh, his cohorts Terry Nichols
    and Michael Fortier, and, most recently, Hank Earl Carr, who gunned down his stepson and
    three police officers in Tampa last spring before turning his gun on himself.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">A loophole in the nation&#146;s gun laws allowed these outlaws and
    many other criminals to purchase the tools of their trade at gun shows. These arms bazaars
    provide a haven for felons and illegal gun dealers who want to skirt federal gun laws and
    buy and sell guns cash-and-carry. Since the Brady Law was implemented in 1994, federally
    licensed firearms dealers have conducted background checks on all handgun purchasers. In
    most states and under federal law, however, it is perfectly legal for individuals to sell
    guns from their &quot;private collections&quot; at gun shows without a waiting period or
    background check on the purchaser. Many unscrupulous gun dealers exploit this loophole to
    operate full-fledged businesses without following federal or state gun laws. And criminals
    are more than happy to keep these merchants of death in business.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Representative Rod Blagojevich (D-IL) introduced
    legislation this past session that would close the gun show loophole nationwide.
    Additionally, the first statewide referendum on gun shows (Revision 12) will appear on the
    Florida ballot this November. Revision 12 would allow counties to require criminal
    background checks and a three-to-five-day waiting period for anyone buying a firearm at a
    gun show, even if the gun is purchased from an unlicensed dealer. Support for Revision 12
    is overwhelming, among gun owners and non-gun-owners alike. A recent Mason-Dixon
    Political/Media Research poll indicated that 79% of all Florida voters approve of closing
    unregulated gun show loopholes. A poll conducted by Peter Hart Research Inc. in February
    found 68% support among gun owners. The National Rifle Association virulently opposes
    Revision 12. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Gun violence and tragic accidents plague our
    communities because guns have fallen into the hands of criminals and children,&quot; said
    Mayor Penelas. &quot;Requiring background checks and waiting periods on gun sales is just
    common sense.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Gun shows are dangerous relics of the Wild West that
    still, in 1998, can be held anywhere, anytime and by anybody, where anyone can buy just
    about any type of gun, no questions asked,&quot; said Congressman Blagojevich. &quot;It&#146;s
    the last frontier for criminals with felony records who want guns.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I commend Mayor Penelas and Congressman Blagojevich
    for courageously standing up to the gun lobby and fighting to close the gun show
    loophole,&quot; said Mr. Brady. &quot;How many more David Koreshes, Timothy McVeighs, and
    run-of-the-mill street criminals will we arm before we start requiring background checks
    on all sales at gun shows in Florida and across the nation?&quot;</font></p>
