    13 - Human Rights Watch today publicly released a letter to Virginia Governor James
    Gilmore, calling for a stay of execution for Dwayne Allen Wright. Wright, who was
    convicted of a murder committed when he was seventeen years old, is scheduled for
    execution by lethal injection tomorrow evening. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No
    one should be executed for crimes committed as a minor,&quot; said Lois Whitman, Executive
    Director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights. &quot;The rest of the world
    has recognized this as a barbaric practice. The United States should too.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The letter notes that every country in the world, with the
    exception of the United States and Somalia, has ratified the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, which specifically prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders. Since 1990,
    only five other countries - Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen - are known to
    have executed juvenile offenders. The United States, however, has executed eight juvenile
    offenders during this time period, more than the reported total for any other nation in
    the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch also noted a disturbing trend of
    executing juvenile offenders who may be mentally retarded. During 1998, two other juvenile
    offenders&#151;Joseph John Cannon and Robert Anthony Carter&#151;have been executed in the
    United States. Like Dwayne Allen Wright, both were reported to be brain damaged, and
    border-line mentally retarded. In both cases, the jury received little information about
    the defendants' mental condition before they were sentenced to death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wright's jury also was not informed that at age thirteen,
    he was diagnosed with brain damage and mental illness. Two of the jurors have publicly
    stated that had they received this information, they would not have voted to impose a
    death sentence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The United States has more juvenile offenders on
    death row than any other country in the world,&quot; said Jo Becker, Children's Rights
    Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. &quot;This is a shameful claim to world
    leadership, especially considering that every juvenile offender scheduled for execution
    this year may have been mentally retarded.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The execution of individuals for crimes committed before
    age eighteen is specifically prohibited by the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights, which has been ratified by the United States, and more than 125 other
    countries, as well as by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </font></p>
