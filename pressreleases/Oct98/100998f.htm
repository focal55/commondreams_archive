    Wyoming Highlights The Need For Congress To Pass The Hate Crimes Prevention Act; Brutality

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 9 - A gay University of Wyoming student was savagely attacked Thursday night,
    burned, and left to die for up to 18 hours tied to a wooden fence outside Laramie, 30
    miles northwest of Cheyenne.&nbsp; The assault on Matthew Shepard, 21, by fellow students
    underscores the need for Congress to move forward and pass pending hate crimes
    legislation, according HRC.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We are outraged and sickened by this
    attack performed by a group of cowards.&nbsp; How long does the brutality have to go on
    until Congress sends the message that this type of behavior is unacceptable and will not
    be tolerated in our society?&nbsp; It is time to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention
    Act,&quot; said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Shepard was found he was unconscious and
    his skull had been smashed with a blunt object; he also appeared to have substantial burns
    on his body and cuts on his head and face, his family said.&nbsp; Two motorcyclists who
    found his body said he looked &quot;like a scarecrow&quot; because of the way he was
    positioned on the fence.&nbsp; Shepard is now in critical condition in the intensive care
    unit at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado&nbsp; where he remains
    unconscious and hooked up to a respirator.&nbsp; He had twice been beaten recently and
    attributed those attacks to his openness about his sexuality, friends told the Associated
    Press.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three University of Wyoming students were
    arrested Thursday in connection with the attack.&nbsp; Authorities say they expect more
    arrests.&nbsp; There are no hate crimes laws in Wyoming and efforts to pass a law have
    been rebuffed repeatedly because critics have claimed it would give gay Americans
    &quot;special rights.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is nothing special about living
    life free of violence and nothing right about opposing laws that would help remedy this
    situation.&nbsp; Those who oppose hate crimes legislation are either burying their heads
    in the sand or they simply don't care that thousands of gay and lesbian Americans are
    being harassed and brutalized each year,&quot; said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth
    Birch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July, both the House and Senate Judiciary
    Committees held hearings to amend current federal law to include sexual orientation,
    gender and disability and to expand federal law enforcement jurisdiction is an important
    step towards closing a loophole needed to assist Americans affected by hate motivated
    attacks. But since the hearings, there has been no movement on this legislation. The Hate
    Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA), sponsored by Senators Kennedy (D-MA), Specter (R-PA), and
    Wyden (D-OR),&nbsp; and Representatives McCollum (R-FL) and Schumer (D-NY), would amend
    current federal law to include real or perceived sexual orientation, gender, and
    disability.&nbsp; The amendment would enable the FBI to investigate and prosecute violent
    hate crimes against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals.&nbsp; Current law already allows
    investigation and prosecution only on the basis of race, religion, national origin and
    color.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study released in August by Dr. Karen
    Franklin, a forensic psychologist at the Washington Institute for Mental Illness Research
    and Training, suggests that harassment and hate crimes against gay students by their peers
    is commonplace.&nbsp; According to the study, nearly one-quarter of community college
    students who took part in this survey admitted to harassing people they thought were gay.
    &nbsp; Among men, 18 percent said they had physically assaulted or threatened someone they
    thought was gay or lesbian.&nbsp; And 32 percent admitted they were guilty of verbal
    harassment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hate crimes committed against gays, lesbians,
    and bisexuals make up the third-highest category of hate crimes reported to the FBI,
    currently representing 11.6% of all hate crimes reported.&nbsp; Only 21 states and the
    District of Columbia include sexual orientation-based crimes in their hate crimes
    statutes. While states continue to play the primary role in the prosecution of hate
    violence, the federal government must have jurisdiction to address those limited cases in
    which local authorities are either unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's
    largest national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the
    country, effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public
    to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work,
    and in the community. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">- 30 -</font></td>
