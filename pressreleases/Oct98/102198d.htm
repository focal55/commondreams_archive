    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><tt><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 21 - Recent extreme weather in the U.S. is part of a global trend of rising
    frequency and cost of extreme weather events that is consistent with scientists&#146;
    predictions about global warming, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG. The
    report, &quot;<a href="http://www.pirg.org/enviro/global_w/cost98/index.htm">The Rising
    Cost of Global Warming</a>,&quot; documents 376 deaths and $14.5 billion in economic loss
    suffered by victims of extreme weather events in the United States between January and
    August of this year. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Big business keeps making
    claims about how much it will cost to tackle the problem of global warming. What about the
    cost to Americans if we do not tackle this problem? If we do not act now, the world&#146;s
    climate experts tell us that the weather may be even more extreme in the future,&quot;
    said Katherine Silverthorne of U.S. PIRG. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report compiles and analyses data on economic loss,
    insured loss and federal disaster aid due to extreme weather related disasters this year.
    Federal disaster aid information includes data from the Federal Emergency Management
    Agency, the Small Business Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Farm
    Service Agency. The report does not include data on disaster spending from Housing and
    Urban Development, the Federal Highway Administration, or state emergency management
    offices. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Something strange is happening,&quot; said Leigh
    Hauter of Bull Run Mountain Organic Farms. &quot;Last winter the ground did not freeze on
    my farm; not once. That has never happened in my memory.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Among the findings of the report are: </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Extreme weather in the U.S. between January and July of 1998
        resulted in the death of 376 people and caused $14.5 billion in economic loss. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The average number of disaster declarations has increased
        from 25 per year between 1979-1983 to 46.6 per year between 1994-1998 -- an 86% increase. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Worldwide, the economic loss related to natural catastrophes
        in the last ten years is 8.5 times the cost in the 1960&#146;s (adjusted to present
        value). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">American communities experienced more than $5.3 billion of
        insured losses due to weather-related events in the first eight months of 1998. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The U.S. government spent more than $1.3 billion in disaster
        assistance in the first eight months of 1998. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The damage was not centralized in one area of the country.
        The five states receiving the most compensation for weather related damage were, in
        descending order, Minnesota, California, North Carolina, Tennessee, and New York. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Recognizing that no single storm can be attributed to
    global warming, U.S. PIRG argues that the growing toll of extreme weather on
    America&#146;s communities should make combating global warming a top priority for
    Congress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;People around the country are suffering -- losing
    homes, businesses, and in the worst cases, even loved ones. Yet, Rather than confront the
    problem of global warming, many in Congress are actively blocking even small steps to
    reduce emissions,&quot; said Silverthorne. &quot;Global warming is a three alarm blaze and
    instead of calling the fire department Congress is fanning the flames.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">US PIRG called on Congress to limit the greenhouse gas
    emissions from power plants, to stop prohibiting the Department of Transportation from
    updating fuel efficiency standards for cars and sport utility vehicles, and to shift
    funding away from polluting fossil fuels and toward renewable energy and energy efficiency
    technologies. In the United States, power plants, automobiles and sport utility vehicles
    are the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. However,
    the U.S. currently has no limits on the amount of carbon dioxide vehicles and power plants
    can emit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the international Climate Summit last December in Kyoto,
    Japan, nations agreed to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases that cause global
    warming. However, many important details remain to be decided. A major international
    meeting to begin to hammer out the details will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
    November 2-13, 1998. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We are on the eve of the next round of international
    global warming negotiations,&quot; said Silverthorne. &quot;When the American delegation
    goes to Buenos Aires next month, they should represent the interests of the American
    people, not the polluters. They should commit to cut global warming pollution in the
    United States and to sign the Kyoto Protocol as a signal of our commitment to find an
    international answer to the problem of global warming.&quot; </font></p>
