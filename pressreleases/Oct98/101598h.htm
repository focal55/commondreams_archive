    October 15 - As Congress adjourns, an analysis of Federal Election Commission records
    shows that tobacco PACs pumped more than $1.1 million into the election campaigns of
    current House members in the last 18 months to ensure that they took no action on tobacco
    this year.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The study, conducted by the National
    Center for Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund, shows that the top 15 House tobacco PAC
    recipients include four key members who are part of the House leadership and control the
    chamber's inaction on tobacco: Speaker of the House Gingrich (R-Ga.), Majority Leader
    Armey (R-Texas), Majority Whip DeLay (R-Texas) and Republican Conference Chairman Boehner
    (R-Ohio).The House study examined tobacco PAC contributions made from January 1, 1997
    through June 30, 1998.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Senate, where comprehensive tobacco legislation (the
    McCain bill) died on the floor last June, tobacco PACs contributed almost $1.2 million
    dollars in campaign contributions to members of the chamber during the six year period
    from January 1, 1993 through June 30, 1998. The Senate study spanned six years in order to
    include the staggered election cycles of all current members.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A closer examination of the House data underscores a
    pattern of contributions to Republicans designed to thwart legislative activity on tobacco
    issues. Of the 45 House members who accepted $9,000 or more from the industry, a full 31
    were Republicans, and only four of the remaining 14 Democrats were from non-tobacco
    producing states. Overall, House Republicans took, on average, almost twice as much as
    Democrats -- $3,439 and $1,874, respectively.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the House, the top 15 takers accepted more than $12,000
    in the last 18 months, and were led by Representatives Bunning (R-Ky.) $35,500 and Baesler
    (D-Ky.) $31,500 (both are candidates for an open Senate seat). The remaining 13 members in
    this category include:Etheridge (D-N.C.) $22,000; Whitfield (R-Ky.) $21,000; Bliley
    (R-Va.) $19,750; Jones (R-N.C.) $19,100; DeLay (R-Texas) $18,000; McIntyre (D-N.C.)
    $17,000; Chambliss (R-Ga.) $15,500; Coble (R-N.C.); $14,700;Gingrich (R-Ga.) $14,500;
    Ensign (R-Nev.) $13,500; Burr (R-N.C.) $13,000; Armey (R-Texas) $13,000 and Boehner
    (R-Ohio) $12,800.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;On tobacco issues, the 105th Congress will go down as
    the 'take PAC money and do nothing Congress,' in which the tobacco industry ensured that
    its interests would reign,&quot; said Bill Novelli, president of the National Center for
    Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund. &quot;This Congress did nothing to stop the marketing of
    tobacco to kids, while packing away millions in tobacco industry campaign contributions.
    Because members of Congress remain hooked on tobacco campaign money,our nation's youth
    will continue to be the targets of addictive tobacco product marketers.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The study also analyzes the amounts of money members of
    Congress accepted from tobacco PACs matched against their positions on the most
    significant tobacco control measures of the 105th Congress: the cloture vote on the McCain
    bill in the Senate and co-sponsorship of either the Meehan-Hansen or Fazio legislation in
    the House. Senators who voted against cloture on the McCain bill -- which effectively
    killed the legislation -- took an average of more than four times the amount of campaign
    contributions from tobacco interests than those who voted &quot;yes.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the House, members who failed to sign on to either the
    Meehan-Hansen or Fazio legislation -- two comprehensive tobacco control bills supported by
    the public health community -- took almost nine times the amount of tobacco PAC
    contributions as those who co-sponsored either bill. Those failing to support either the
    Meehan-Hansen or Fazio bills accepted an average of $3,514 in tobacco PAC contributions
    over the last 18 months, while co-sponsors of either or both pieces of legislation only
    took $396.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the period from 1993-1998, the average tobacco campaign
    contribution for Senators who did not support the cloture petition on the McCain bill
    (i.e., voted against the legislation) was $21,375,while Senators who supported the
    provision accepted only $5,044.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From 1993-1998, 11 Senators accepted more than $30,000 in
    contributions from tobacco PACs: Senators Faircloth (R-N.C.) $91,416; Helms (R-N.C.)
    $66,750; McConnell (R-Ky.)&nbsp; $47,950; Thompson (R-Tenn.) $47,000; Hutchison (R-Texas)
    $44,923; Warner (R-Va.) $43,566; Hollings (D-S.C.) $41,500; Santorum (R-Pa.) $35,500;
    Burns (R-Mont.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The tobacco contributions indicate a clear strategy of
    giving heavily to members of the Senate Republican leadership -- those in a position to
    control debate on the McCain legislation. Senate Republican leadership (Majority Leader
    Lott (R-Miss.) and Majority Whip and Assistant Majority Leader Nickles (R-Okla.)) took an
    average of $20,208 between 1993-1998, while the minority Democratic leadership (Minority
    Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) and Minority Whip Ford(D-Ky.) accepted an average of&nbsp; just
    $4,500 (Sen. Daschle accepted no tobacco contributions and Sen. Ford, who represents a
    tobacco-producing state, accepted $9,000). Overall, Senate Republicans accepted almost
    four times as much money from tobacco PACs as their Democratic counterparts -- $17,662 and
    $4,867, respectively.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;These numbers make clear that the real issue in the
    congressional debate on tobacco control was money -- big campaign money from Big
    Tobacco,&quot; said Matthew Myers, general counsel of the Action Fund. &quot;The money
    that really mattered in this debate was not the price of a pack of cigarettes; rather it
    was the millions of dollars that tobacco companies happily paid to buy continued
    allegiance from Congress. We will continue to work to ensure that the 106th is a
    'do-something' Congress on comprehensive tobacco control.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The House and Senate analyses include only contributions
    from tobacco-related PACs (a) and do not account for the industry's substantial soft money
    contributions. A listing of the House and Senate tobacco PAC contributions examined in the
    study is available upon request.</font></p>
