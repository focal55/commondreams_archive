    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 29 - Environmental groups say they are moving the fight to protect our environment
    to a whole new level -- the state level. GREEN (the Grassroots Environmental Effectiveness
    Network), sponsored by Defenders of Wildlife, announced today that it is launching the
    State Biodiversity Project. The new program will create a nationwide grassroots network of
    conservation and wildlife advocates with the goal of strengthening state wildlife and
    wildlands legislation. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We want to be a
    resource for groups that are working to pass strong state wildlife and wildlands
    laws,&quot; says Sue George, Defenders of Wildlife State Counsel and co-director of the
    new biodiversity network. &quot;For citizens who feel that they are the only ones who care
    about wildlife and wildlands in their states, GREEN can connect them with others who are
    working on the same issues.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Building from GREEN's national network, the program is
    designed to help mobilize grassroots pressure at the state level and to share information,
    strategies, tactics and organizing tools among activists across the country. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">GREEN, a project of Defenders of Wildlife, has an
    impressive track record of working on federal legislation. The network will now work at
    the state level as well, where action on wildlife and habitat issues is increasing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This program is a natural extension of the work we
    have been doing on federal environmental legislation,&quot; says Roger Featherstone,
    director of GREEN and co-director with George of the network. &quot;We see this as an
    opportunity to provide real support on state-level issues.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">State laws, policies and programs are critical in
    protecting wildlife species and habitat, he says. &quot;Because of the trend toward
    weakening federal environmental laws and shifting responsibility to the states, state
    legislation is increasingly a means for protecting or destroying our environment.&quot;
    However, Featherstone warns, efforts on the part of state government officials and
    politicians to pass positive environmental laws have been piecemeal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;States have the primary responsibility to protect
    wildlife and wildlands within their borders,&quot; explains George. &quot;But, for the
    most part, they have not tapped into their resources to address one of the most urgent
    problems they face - the loss of plants, animals, and habitat.&quot; George notes that
    wildlife and wildlands are important not only for spiritual and emotional reasons, but
    also because they provide food, economic and medicinal resources to states. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Working with citizens across the country, GREEN is hoping
    to make a huge impact on state wildlife and wildlands protection with measures ranging
    from state endangered species acts to habitat acquisition. In addition to co-directors
    George and Featherstone, the program will be staffed by several regional organizers who
    will work closely with citizens in each state. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The network will disseminate updates on state campaigns,
    information about the progress of state laws, campaign reports from member groups and
    action alerts. In addition, GREEN's staff will provide technical support to citizens by
    analyzing select wildlife issues, developing model state biodiversity laws and training
    activists about organizing tools. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Activists will be offered free subscriptions to WILDlines,
    a publication that highlights contentious state environmental issues, threats to wildlife
    and wildlands, actions by state agencies and grassroots success stories. A sample of the
    publication follows. </font></p>
