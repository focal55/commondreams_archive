    October 9 - The imminent execution of Dwayne Allen Wright, scheduled for 14 October in the
    State of Virginia, shows yet again the USA's disregard for international standards of
    justice and humane treatment, Amnesty International said. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dwayne Wright was sentenced to death for a crime committed when he had just
    turned 17. International human rights standards ban the use of the death penalty for
    crimes committed when under 18. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If the State of Virginia carries out this execution,
    it will be retreating deep into its past, having not executed a juvenile offender since
    1932,&quot; said Pierre Sané, Secretary General of Amnesty International, during a
    nationwide tour to launch a year-long campaign on human rights violations in the USA. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Surely, at the end of the 20th century, the state
    should have transferred the death penalty for juveniles from its statute books to its
    history books. Instead it continues to add to the violence in US society.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It is ironic that the country which repeatedly
    proclaims itself to be the most progressive force for human rights in the world, holds
    international human rights standards in such low regard,&quot; added Mr Sané. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like many of the 70 juvenile offenders currently on death
    row in the USA, Dwayne Allen Wright, who is African American, grew up in poverty, was
    exposed to violence from an early age and has suffered from serious mental problems.
    &quot;His situation is further evidence that the death penalty in the USA is used
    disproportionately against the poor, minorities, those abused or deprived as children, and
    the mentally ill,&quot; Mr Sané said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since 1990, only six countries are known to have executed
    people for crimes committed when under 18. Five of them - Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi
    Arabia and Yemen - have executed a total of nine such prisoners between them. The sixth
    country - the USA - has executed eight juvenile offenders in the same period, including
    two this year. The USA is the only country in the world known to have executed juvenile
    offenders in 1998. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The US federal authorities -- Mr Sané said -- must
    not be allowed to make their usual excuse for this human rights violation by stating that
    it is up to each US state to deal with its violent juvenile offenders as it sees fit.
    Neither the Virginia state authorities nor the federal authorities can claim ignorance of
    the international standards forbidding the execution of juvenile offenders.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under international law, the federal system of government
    cannot be used to justify a breach of a country&#146;s international obligations. If the
    authorities in Virginia refuse to abide by international law, then the federal authorities
    must intervene as a matter of urgency and stop this execution, Mr Sané argued. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Activists have been flooding government offices with
    appeals for adherence to global standards and for the commutation of Dwayne Wright's death
    sentence to a more humane alternative. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The world has agreed that juvenile offenders should be
    protected from the death penalty, not in an attempt to excuse violent juvenile crime, but
    in recognition of the fact that children are not yet fully responsible for their actions
    and that the scope for their rehabilitation is greater than for adults. It has long been
    held that the would-be death penalty goals of deterrence and retribution cannot be met in
    the case of juvenile offenders. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Background information</b><br>
    Dwayne Wright grew up in a deprived neighbourhood of Washington DC, where he witnessed
    habitual gun violence and murder. From the age of four he lost his father to
    incarceration. His mother, who suffered from mental illness, was often unemployed for long
    periods. When he was 10, his older half-brother to whom he was very close, was murdered.
    After this Dwayne Wright developed serious emotional problems. Between the ages of 12 and
    17, he spent periods in hospital and juvenile detention facilities. During this time he
    was treated for &quot;major depression with psychotic episodes,&quot; his mental capacity
    was evaluated as borderline retarded, his verbal ability as retarded, and doctors found
    signs of organic brain damage. At the age of 17, Dwayne Wright went on a two-day violent
    crime spree, which culminated in a brutal murder. He was caught the next day, confessed to
    the police and was tried in 1991. He is now 26. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
    (ICCPR) forbids the sentencing to death and executing of people for crimes committed when
    they were under 18. When the USA ratified the ICCPR in 1992 it explicitly reserved the
    right to ignore this ban. UN experts have repeatedly stated that the reservation is
    invalid and should be withdrawn and that the USA's continuing use of the death penalty
    against juvenile offenders violates international human rights law. The governments of 11
    European countries have also protested against the US reservation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also bans the
    execution of those under 18 at the time of the crime. The USA is one of only two countries
    in the world that have not ratified the Convention. The other is Somalia, a collapsed
    state with no recognized government. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the space of 27 days in mid-1998, Texas executed two men
    for crimes they committed when they were 17. Amnesty International has described their
    executions as amounting to acts of simple vengeance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International launched a worldwide campaign on
    human rights violations in the USA on 6 October 1998 with its report Rights for All. As a
    part of the campaign, AI members will be calling on the USA to halt the executions of
    juvenile offenders as a first step towards total abolition of the death penalty. </font></p>
