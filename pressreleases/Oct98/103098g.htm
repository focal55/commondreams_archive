    October 30 - The United Steelworkers of America (USWA) today filed its response to the
    U.S. government in an Alabama federal court case that constitutionally challenges the
    North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In
    opposing the U.S. Justice Department's effort to dismiss the case on the basis of legal
    standing, the union lawyers argue that contrary to the government's contentions, the
    relief being sought in the lawsuit would redress the injuries being alleged and those
    injuries are the direct result of NAFTA itself. Among the injuries are the continued loss
    of jobs and wages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The union also insisted that the question of whether the
    U.S. Executive and Legislative Branches are free to ignore the constitutionally-required
    ratification procedure is one for the courts to decide. Today's USWA court papers
    declared, &quot;This case...is not about a policy question, but about a fundamental issue
    of constitutional law: May the President and Congress...disregard the 'Treaty Clause' of
    the Constitution?&quot; The USWA answer is &quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The original lawsuit filed by the USWA and the 'Made in the
    USA Foundation' in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama on July 13, 1998, alleged
    that NAFTA is a treaty and therefore should be declared null and void because it was not
    approved by the constitutionally required two-thirds vote of the U.S. Senate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Citing the constitutional history of the 'Treaty Clause,'
    the USWA argued in today's court filing that the clause was intended to restrain
    government power on matters affecting its citizens such as NAFTA. &quot;The Constitution
    expressly provides that the President must receive the consent of two-thirds of the Senate
    before making a treaty. For that reason, as a matter of constitutional dictate, the U.S.
    does not speak with 'one voice' on the subject of treaties, but with two -- that of the
    President and that of the Senate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot; The USWA amended the lawsuit to include individuals
    as voters from Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia on the basis that their voting rights as
    citizens were diluted by the government's non-compliance with the
    constitutionally-required two-thirds vote of NAFTA as a treaty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">NAFTA was adopted following a U.S. Senate vote of 61-38
    (less than the 67 votes required by the Constitution) on Nov. 17, 1993, and a U.S. House
    of Representatives vote of 234-200 three days later.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More than 7,000 workers represented by the USWA at 34
    locations have been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor as having lost employment
    because of the movement of their employers to Mexico or Canada, or have lost jobs because
    of an increase in imports from these countries. Since NAFTA's adoption in 1993, more
    than202,000 U.S. workers at 1,724 plants have been certified by the Labor Department for
    trade adjustment assistance because their jobs have been displaced.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The landmark case has been assigned to Judge Robert Propst.
    ------ Copies of the court filings are available on the USWA's Web site at: <a href="http://www.naftalawsuit.org/">www.naftalawsuit.org/</a></font></p>
