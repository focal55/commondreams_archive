    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 19 - U.S. PIRG today blasted the proposed Omnibus Appropriations bill.&nbsp; The
    group was particularly outraged at the many anti-environmental provisions or
    &quot;riders&quot; that are still in the proposed bill.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If the proposed bill is enacted, polluters win big and the public and the
    environment lose,&quot; said Anna Aurilio, a staff scientist with U.S. PIRG. &quot;We are
    outraged that the budget negotiators in the U.S. Congress have proposed a bill that would,
    among other things, weaken protection for the ozone layer, rip off taxpayers while
    subsidizing oil companies, and destroy public lands,&quot; she added.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the many retrograde riders in this bill, new riders continue to surface.
    &nbsp; &quot;This bill already stinks, but now its getting smellier as new assaults on the
    environment are uncovered,&quot; said Kim Delfino, a staff attorney with U.S. PIRG.<br>
    <br>
    This bill includes riders that will:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Double the amount of timber cut on three national forests in
        California under the Quincy Library Group proposal.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Potentially allow a road to be built through environmentally
        sensitive lands within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.&nbsp; It also provides $17.5
        million to the East Aleutian Borough for improvements to the King Cove airport and medical
        clinic and $20 million for the construction of an access road to a Cold Bay marine link.
        &nbsp; Even though the original Izembek rider was modified to exclude the construction of
        the road through a wilderness area, the rider remains objectionable because it allows the
        access road to be sited within the Refuge.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Encourage the development of fragile and flood-prone coastal
        areas in Florida and South Carolina by removing these areas from the Coastal Barrier
        Resource System, thereby making them eligible for federal flood insurance.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Delay for eight months a new oil royalty rule that would
        force the oil industry to stop underpaying the royalties it owes for the billions of
        dollars worth of oil it extracts from public lands. The revenue from these royalties would
        go to environmental programs and state public education funds.&nbsp; By delaying the new
        rule, this provision allows the oil industry to cheat taxpayers and school children out of
        approximately $44 million.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Delay for one year much-needed environmental regulations on
        mining. Right now, the mining industry does not have to comply with any environmental
        standards, or guarantee that it can pay for the cleanup of environmentally destructive
        mines.&nbsp; By delaying the mining regulations, this rider leaves the environment
        unprotected and ensures that taxpayers will end up paying for more cleanups of toxic
        mining sites.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Perpetuate environmentally-destructive grazing practices by
        allowing the Bureau of Land Management to reauthorize grazing permits affecting at least
        25 million acres without conducting any environmental review.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allow private companies to chop down trees in exchange for
        performing certain forest protection activities.&nbsp; Some of these stewardship
        activities may be environmentally worthy, but the rider sets up the program to be abused
        by failing to provide for any oversight, and also creates a perverse cycle of chopping
        down the forests to help save them.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Encourage the logging of more old-growth trees from the
        Tongass National Forest in Alaska, by tying the sale of much-demanded red cedar to the
        amount of timber sold in Alaska overall.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Remove a rider that would dictate massive increases in
        logging from the Tongass National Forest, but only in exchange for increasing the
        commercial timber sale and roadbuilding budget for the Tongass by $12.5 million.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prevent federal agencies from using any funds to reintroduce
        grizzly bears into the Selway-Bitterroot ecosystem of Idaho and Montana.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Deny funding for the removal of dams on the Elwha River in
        Washington, hampering restoration efforts for threatened and endangered species of salmon.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Pay for a $15 million road to a privately owned ski resort
        across environmentally sensitive land in Utah, and allow the road to be constructed
        without any environmental review.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Impede Alaska parkland acquisition by requiring the
        government to seek to exchange public lands for private lands in parks instead of giving
        the government flexibility to decide to do a land exchange or a buy out.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Circumvent environmental review for three highway projects
        in California, New York, and Alabama.&nbsp; The California highway project is to be built
        within a state park that contains fragile wetland coastal habitat and is home to at least
        six threatened or endangered species.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Transfer the Land Between the Lakes forest, a valued 170,000
        acre hardwood forest in Kentucky, to the Forest Service and open it up to logging.
        &nbsp; This rider waives compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and sets up
        a perverse funding mechanism that funds the Land Between the Lakes Forest with money from
        logging and mining.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Undermine the Wilderness Act by shifting the emphasis in
        managing wilderness areas from solitude to recreational use.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Divert 10% of the Roads and Trails Fund ­ which is used to
        repair and improve roads and trails ­ to unspecified &quot;forest health&quot; projects.
        &nbsp; In other words, this provision takes roads and trails money and puts it toward
        timber sales.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Push back four years, from 2001 to 2005, the phase-out date
        of methyl bromide, a major culprit in the depletion of the ozone layer.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Block the Department of Transportation from updating CAFÉ
        standards (miles-per-gallon standards) for cars and light trucks, even thought these
        standards have not been significantly updated since 1985.&nbsp; Current standards reflect
        neither improvements in technology nor the types of vehicles on the road.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Require the Office of Management and Budget to develop
        burdensome and duplicative cost-benefit analyses that will be &quot;peer reviewed&quot; in
        secret. The public will not be given an opportunity to comment on these analyses.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Anti-environmental riders like the Quincy Library
    Group proposal and the methyl bromide rider run roughshod over our public lands and
    threaten public health and safety,&quot; said Kim Delfino.<br>
    <br>
    U.S. PIRG commended White House negotiators for stripping some anti-environmental riders,
    including several which would have restricted salmon recovery plans on the Columbia and
    Snake Rivers, waived endangered species protections, and increased logging in certain
    national forests. U.S. PIRG also praised the $120 million increase in energy efficiency
    and renewable energy programs.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;While we applaud the Administration's success at stripping certain
    anti-environmental riders and increasing funding for clean energy programs, this proposed
    bill still contains unacceptable anti-environmental riders which cheat the American public
    out of a clean environment while handing our hard-earned tax dollars and precious natural
    resources to polluters,&quot; said Lexi Shultz, a staff attorney with U.S. PIRG.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Last week, the President said that he would veto a bill that did 'unacceptable harm
    to the environment.'&nbsp; Well, this is where the rubber hits the road,&quot; said Kim
    Delfino.&nbsp; &quot;Unless the remaining anti-environmental riders are removed, we call
    on President Clinton to live up to his promise and veto this bill,&quot; she added.</font></p>
