    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">BOSTON - October
    19 - A judge has ruled that the Massachusetts Department of Social Services violated the
    first amendment free speech rights of social worker, Linda Pereira, a former Fall River
    City Counselor, who was fired after telling a racist joke at her table at a private
    dinner. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a ruling made public last Friday, Judge
    Herman Smith of the Suffolk Superior Court ordered Pereira reinstated to her position with
    back pay and found DSS Commissioner Linda Carlisle individually liable to Pereira for
    monetary damages for making the decision to fire Pereira. The amount of damages will have
    to be established at a later trial, said Eric Maxwell, a cooperating attorney for the ACLU
    of Massachusetts who represented Pereira. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pereira had been employed by DSS for more than 12 years,
    during which time she had an unblemished work record. She had never displayed racist
    sentiments or acted in a racist manner. On February 5, 1996, Pereira attended the private
    party, during which a city official told her a grossly sexist joke. In response, she told
    him the racist joke. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The joke was overheard and reported in the press,
    inaccurately, as being included in her speech condemning voting irregularities. Carlisle
    immediately placed Pereira on administrative leave and fired her on April 10, 1996. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although Judge Smith described Pereira's joke as
    &quot;racist and utterly detestable,&quot; he said his decision was based on the basic
    First Amendment principle that public employees' free speech rights are determined by
    balancing the interests of the employee as a citizen against the interests of the
    employer. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this case, he ruled that DSS had made no showing that
    Pereira's comment impaired the effective functioning of DSS. Although 25 people called DSS
    to complain about Pereira's statements, this did not show any interference with the
    regular operation of the agency. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Quoting U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, Judge
    Smith noted &quot;that a purely private statement on a matter of public concern will
    rarely, if ever, justify discharge of a public employee.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Judge Smith also ruled that Commissioner Carlisle was
    personally liable to Pereira because &quot;a reasonable official would have understood
    that firing plaintiff for making a racist comment at an event not open to the public
    violated her right to free speech.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Maxwell said that Pereira was a good social worker who made
    a stupid statement. &quot;The judge's decision properly protects public employees from
    being fired for their private comments.&quot;</font></p>
