    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 29 - Big Tobacco fired up an intense lobbying campaign in the first half of 1998,
    spending more than $43 million on high-priced, insider lobbyists -- an astonishing 174
    percent increase from the same period in 1997, according to a Public Citizen report
    released today.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Big Tobacco
    paid lobbyists unprecedented amounts to keep crucial public health legislation from being
    passed,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;This money helped buy
    early deaths for thousands of teen smokers and will leave an enduring stain on our society
    as American families struggle with tobacco-related fatalities and injuries well into the
    next century.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The $43.3 million in lobbying expenses
    reported by six tobacco companies and three industry trade groups breaks all previous
    spending records set by the tobacco industry, according to the report,<i><b> Blowing Smoke</b></i>,
    an analysis based on lobbying disclosures for the first half of the year.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This remarkable attempt to buy
    influence through lobbying, while considerable, reveals only a fraction of the money <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Tobacco/">Big Tobacco</a> spent last year to thwart tobacco
    control legislation,&quot; Claybrook said. &quot;The tobacco companies spent millions on
    grassroots campaign expenditures that are not required to be reported. They spent at least
    $40 million for TV and other advertising, and another $5.6 million has been spent so far
    in this election cycle to influence the outcome of federal elections through soft money
    and PAC contributions. They spare no expense when it comes to protecting their profits,
    even at the cost of millions of lives.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the $5.6 million in soft money and
    PAC contributions, $4.3 million -- 77 percent -- went to Republicans, and $1.3 million --
    23 percent -- to Democrats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the tobacco companies were able to
    block passage of a strong, pro-health tobacco control bill, they were unsuccessful in
    their efforts to pass a sweetheart settlement deal that would have let them off the hook
    for the death and disease caused by their products and for decades of lying about the
    dangers of tobacco. The industry sought broad protections from legal liability and once
    those protections were stripped from the tobacco bill, the industry began to withdraw its
    support for the legislation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first six months of the year,
    according to the report:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Big Tobacco&#146;s $43.3 million in lobbying expenditures
            represents a 174 percent increase over the first half of 1997 and a 22 percent increase
            over the $35.5 million spent in all of 1997. It represents a total industry expenditure
            averaging $81,000 per member of Congress. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tobacco companies besieged the Capitol with an army of 192
            lobbyists -- one for every three members of Congress.These lobbyists included at least
            seven former senators and representatives and at least 18 ex-congressional staff members.
            Also included were big-name politicians, including former Texas Gov. Ann Richards and
            former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, both Democrats, as well as former executive
            branch members and Haley Barbour, formerly head of the Republican National Committee. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Brown and Williamson was the top spender, reporting $18.2
            million in expenditures in the first six months -- a whopping 1,000 percent increase over
            the previous year&#146;s $1.7 million in spending. Philip Morris more than doubled its
            lobbying expenses from the prior year, reporting $14.4 million in expenditures, compared
            with $7 million the year before. </font></li>
