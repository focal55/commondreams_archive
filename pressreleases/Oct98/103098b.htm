    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 30 - Public Citizen's Health Research Group finds it incredible that the Food and
    Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tamoxifen, a drug that is a known human carcinogen,
    to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who are at a so-called high risk of the
    disease. Tamoxifen can induce tumors by altering a woman's DNA and may cause other types
    of cancers years later.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I
    have great concern that otherwise healthy women may be injured or killed from tamoxifen,
    thinking that it was going to prevent them from dying from breast cancer,&quot; said Larry
    D. Sasich, a pharmacist with Public Citizen's Health Research Group</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The FDA based it decision on the results
    of the Breast Cancer Prevention Study published in the Sept. 16, 1998, issue of the <i>Journal
    of the National Cancer Institute</i>. This study showed that tamoxifen has only a meager
    effect in reducing the risk of breast cancer. In contrast, the study demonstrated no
    survival benefit for women taking tamoxifen, but did show that the drug increased the risk
    of uterine cancer by 2.5-fold and can cause other serious adverse effects such as stroke,
    blood clots in the lungs and legs, and cataracts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of the study are as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Survival Benefit</u>. The Breast Cancer Prevention Study
            showed no survival benefit for women taking tamoxifen. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Invasive Breast Cancer</u>. Tamoxifen may be advertised
            to women and physicians as reducing the risk of this type of breast cancer by as much as
            49 percent relative to a placebo. This is very misleading as the actual difference in the
            risk of developing invasive breast cancer between those women who took tamoxifen compared
            to a placebo was only 1.3 percent (2.7% vs 1.4%) after a median of 4.2 years of treatment
            with the drug. This means that 77 women would have to take tamoxifen for 4.2 years to
            prevent a single case of invasive breast cancer. And no woman can tell if she will be that
            one case. The other 76 women will derive no benefit but will be exposed to the
            demonstrated harms caused by this drug. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Endometrial Cancer.</u> There was an increased risk of
            endometrial cancer in those women who took tamoxifen. There were 36 cases (1.4 percent) of
            endometrial cancer in the tamoxifen group and 15 (0.2 percent) in the women receiving
            placebo. Thus, for every 83 women who take tamoxifen for 4.2 years one women will develop
            endometrial cancer. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Stroke. </u>The incidence of stroke increased from 24
            (0.4 percent) cases in the placebo group to 38 cases (0.6 percent) in the women taking
            tamoxifen. This difference approached statistical significance. Seven cases of stroke were
            fatal, three in the placebo group and four in the tamoxifen group. For every 500 women who
            take tamoxifen one will experience a stroke. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Pulmonary Embolism</u>. This type of blood clot in the
            lungs that is potentially fatal occurred in 6 (0.09 percent ) women taking the placebo and
            in 18 (0.28 percent ) women receiving tamoxifen. Three cases of pulmonary embolism in the
            tamoxifen group were fatal, compared to none in the placebo group. For every 526 women who
            take tamoxifen one will develop a blood clot in the lungs. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Cataracts</u>. Cataracts developed in 507 (7.8 percent)
            of the women taking the placebo and 574 (8.8 percent) in the women receiving tamoxifen.
            This difference was statistically significant as was the difference in the probability of
            cataract surgery between women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Quality of Life</u>. The percentage of women who reported
            hot flashes as being either &quot;quite a bit or extremely bothersome&quot; was 45.7
            percent in the tamoxifen group, compared with 28.7 percent in the placebo group. The
            percentage of women reporting vaginal discharge that was &quot;moderately bothersome or
            worse&quot; was 29 percent in the tamoxifen group, compared with 13 percent in the placebo
            group. </font></li>
        </ul>
