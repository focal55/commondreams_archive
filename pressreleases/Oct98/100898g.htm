    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - October
    8 - Colombian guerillas call their child soldeirs &quot;little bees,&quot; because they
    sting before the enemy realizes it's under attack. Paramilitaries call them &quot;little
    bells&quot; because child soldiers are usually deployed in forward positions, where they
    warn the adults of an early attack -- and often bear the worst of it.<br>
    <br>
    Tens of thousands of children are being used as soldiers by all sides to thebloody
    conflict underway in Colombia, according to a Human Rights Watch report released today. Up
    to thirty percent of some guerrilla units are made up of children. The number of children
    in some militias, considered a training ground for future guerrilla fighters, is reported
    to be as high as 85 percent.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Although most of Colombia's child soldiers are over fifteen, all sides are
    recruiting children younger than fifteen, in violation of the laws of war. The three sides
    to the conflict are guerillas, national security units, and paramilitaries. <br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch found that child guerrillas are used to collect intelligence, make and
    deploy mines, and serve as advance troops in ambush attacks against paramilitaries,
    soldiers, and police officers. Those who manage to escape are<br>
    considered deserters and may be subjected to on-the-spot execution. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Colombia's national security forces, including the army and National Police, include over
    15,000 children. Thousands of others are recruited for civic outreach and placed in war
    zones in uniform, at serious risk of attack. The army also captures or accepts the
    surrender of children suspected of being guerrillas, then uses them as guides or
    informants.&nbsp; These children may be forced to patrol with troops, take part in combat,
    collect intelligence, and deactivate land mines. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Paramilitary units, which often operate in direct coordination with national security
    forces and are responsible for some of the conflict's worst abuses, also include large
    numbers of children. Children as young as eight years of age have been seen patrolling
    with paramilitaries, and up to 50 percent of some units are made up of children. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &quot;This use of children is appalling,&quot; says Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy
    Director for Human Rights Watch. &quot;All parties to the conflict should immediately stop
    all recruitment of children under the age of eighteen, and should demobilize all child
    soldiers currently in their ranks.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    International law prohibits the recruitment of any children under the age of 15, and an
    international consensus is building on behalf of prohibitions on any military recruitment
    below the age of 18. Under the new International Criminal Court treaty drafted in July in
    Rome, the conscription and use in hostilities of children under the age of 15 is defined
    as a war crime, to be prosecuted by the Court. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    In late June, Human Rights Watch, together with Amnesty International and other leading
    international nongovernmental organizations, launched a new Coalition to Stop the Use of
    Child Soldiers, which seeks stronger international standards to protect children from
    military recruitment and use in armed conflict. The Coalition is campaigning to raise the
    minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict from 15, set by
    existing international law, to 18. The latest research on child soldiers estimates that
    more than 300,000 children under 18 years old are fighting in armed conflicts around the
    world.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
