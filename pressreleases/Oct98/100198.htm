    October 1 - </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Statement of
    Steven R. Shapiro<br>
    ACLU Legal Director</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Supreme Court has already granted review in more than
    half of the cases it is likely to hear during the upcoming Term. Although the Court is
    never able to escape controversy entirely, for the second year in a row its docket is not
    loaded with headline-generating cases. That, in itself, is an interesting commentary on
    the Supreme Court's role in our constitutional system given the political turmoil now
    swirling around the other branches of government. There are, nonetheless, several cases on
    the docket that could lead to important rulings with long-term consequences for civil
    rights and civil liberties. In addition, there are a number of pending petitions for
    certiorari that raise substantial constitutional questions; some of those petitions are
    almost certain to be granted in the next several months. As always, therefore, the
    complexion of the Supreme Court year can look very different at the end than at the
    beginning.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ACLU is direct counsel in three cases at the moment.
    All three demonstrate both the temptation and risk of sacrificing constitutional principle
    for political expediency. <i><a href="http://www.aclu.org/court/chicagovmorales.html">Chicago
    v. Morales</a></i>, 97-1121, involves a challenge to an anti-gang ordinance enacted by the
    City of Chicago. Until it was struck down by the Illinois courts, more than 45,000 people
    were arrested under the ordinance during a three-year period, not for engaging in violent
    or threatening behavior, but for loitering on the street corner with &quot;no apparent
    purpose&quot; and failing to move on when so ordered by the police. The Supreme Court has
    long recognized the constitutional perils of such vague loitering ordinances. It is thus
    especially disappointing that the Clinton Administration chose to file a brief in support
    of Chicago's law.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second ACLU case is <i><a href="http://www.aclu.org/court/renovadc.html">Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
    Committee</a></i>, 97-1252. It began almost a decade ago as a constitutional challenge to
    the government's decision to begin deportation proceedings against eight California
    residents because of their lawful political advocacy on behalf of Palestinian causes.
    Every federal judge to review the evidence, including nearly 11,000 pages of government
    files, has concluded that the plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of proving that the
    government's actions violated the First Amendment. Despite that finding, or perhaps
    because of it, the government is now arguing that the 1996 amendments to the immigration
    law deprived the federal courts in this case of any jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs'
    constitutional claims. While the government insists that it is not disputing plaintiffs'
    right to judicial review, only when and where it happens, both lower courts correctly
    recognized that the inescapable consequence of the government's position would be to deny
    plaintiffs any meaningful review at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The third ACLU case already accepted for review is <i>Anderson
    v. Roe</i>, 98-97, where the Ninth Circuit struck down a California law intentionally
    designed to limit migration into the state by restricting the welfare benefits of new
    state residents to the level available in their prior state. Thus, for example, while the
    standard monthly grant for a family of four in California is $673, a family of four that
    has moved from Mississippi to California within the last year would receive only $144 per
    month - regardless of whether the family could survive on that amount in California, which
    has one of the highest costs of living in the United States. This issue is hardly a new
    one for the Court. In 1941, the Court held in a landmark decision that California could
    not shut its borders to indigent farmers fleeing the ravages of the &quot;dust bowl.&quot;
    This latest legislation reflects similar motives, albeit in the guise of modern
    &quot;welfare reform.&quot; It is not surprising, therefore, that every lower court to
    address the issue has recognized that such state statutes are incompatible with the very
    notion of a federal union, and thus an unconstitutional abridgement of the right to
    interstate travel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In other cases of note, the Supreme Court will also hear
    argument this Term in <i>Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</i>, 97-843, to resolve
    the question of whether Title IX prohibits student-to- student harassment, and in <i>Hunt
    v. Cromartie</i>, 98-85, to resolve one more time the constitutionality of North
    Carolina's congressional redistricting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On a related subject, the issue of how the census should be
    conducted is before the Supreme Court again in <i>Department of Commerce v. United States
    House of Representatives</i>, 98-404. Two years ago, the Court ruled that the City of New
    York could not compel the Census Bureau to compensate for the historical undercount of
    minority groups by utilizing statistical sampling techniques. This time, the question is
    whether the Census Bureau can be barred from using statistical corrections when its
    experts have concluded that they offer the best chance of obtaining an accurate count of
    the national population. The ACLU is planning to file an amicus brief arguing that the use
    of statistical sampling is fully consistent with the relevant statutes, which must be read
    in light of our constitutional commitment to equal political participation, as embodied in
    both the Civil War Amendments and the doctrine of one person - one vote.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There has been less talk so far about <i><a href="http://www.aclu.org/court/wrightvumscorporation.html">Wright v. Universal Maritime
    Service Corp.,</a></i> 97-889, but it too could have a significant impact on civil rights
    enforcement. The precise issue is whether an employer can use the mandatory arbitration
    clause in a collective bargaining agreement to prevent an employee from suing in federal
    court over an alleged violation of the civil rights laws. The broader question, which the
    Court may or may not reach, is the extent to which employers can impose arbitration
    agreements as a condition of employment and thereby undermine the judicial remedies that
    Congress has created. In an amicus brief filed with the Court, the ACLU has argued that
    such arbitration agreements must be analyzed in terms of traditional waiver principles,
    and cannot be upheld unless they are knowing and voluntary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even in a &quot;quiet&quot; year, these cases demonstrate
    what's at stake when government tries to take away basic freedoms -- from standing on the
    street corner, to supporting controversial political causes, to moving with your family to
    another state, to claiming the protection of important civil rights laws, to literally
    being counted as a member of society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Furthermore, some of the most interesting cases on the
    Court's docket are still awaiting decision on a petition for certiorari, including the
    following ACLU cases:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In<i> Jackson v. Benson</i>, 98-376, we are challenging the
    constitutionality of Wisconsin's school voucher program. Reversing two lower courts, the
    Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the state's multimillion dollar program does not offend
    the Establishment Clause, even though it authorizes payment to parochial schools that can,
    in many instances, exceed their actual tuition costs. Thus far, no other school voucher
    program of this magnitude has ever survived judicial scrutiny.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In <i>Legal Aid Society of Hawaii v. Legal Services Corp</i>.,
    98-296, we are asking the Court to reverse a Ninth Circuit decision upholding recent
    congressional restrictions on the activities of legal services lawyers. Among other
    things, the restrictions prohibit legal services programs that receive any federal funding
    from using even private dollars to challenge the constitutionality of welfare
    &quot;reform&quot; legislation. Other restrictions bar legal services lawyers from
    bringing class actions, as well as engaging in administrative or legislative advocacy. In
    short, a program that was created to provide legal representation to indigent clients in
    civil cases has now been turned into a program where those same clients will often be
    forced to choose between no representation at all and the representation of a lawyer with
    one hand tied behind her back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In<i> Todd v. Rush County</i>, 97-2021, we are seeking
    review of a Seventh Circuit decision upholding a mandatory drug testing policy applied to
    all students who participate in any extracurricular activities, including the chess team
    and debating club. Relying solely on the proposition that participation in extracurricular
    activities is voluntary, the decision goes far beyond the Supreme Court's opinion
    upholding drug testing for student athletes, and strips high school students of any
    meaningful protection against unconstitutional searches.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In<i> Wilson v. Layne</i>, 98-83, we are arguing that the
    Fourth Amendment does not permit the police to expand the terms of a search warrant by
    inviting the press to accompany them into a private home while they execute the warrant.
    The invasion of privacy is magnified, moreover, when the press photograph or video the
    encounter for later publication. The practice, which is becoming increasingly common
    around the country, has also spawned an increasing amount of litigation. However, in
    contrast to cases like <i>Cable News Network. Inc. v. Berger</i>, 97-1914, the plaintiffs
    in this case sued only the police, not the press. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, in<i> Torres v. Massachusetts Dep't of
    Corrections,</i> 98-xxx, we have filed a petition for certiorari in an Eighth Amendment
    case challenging the conditions of confinement in the state's &quot;supermax&quot; prison.
    The issue before the Supreme Court is not whether the Eighth Amendment has been violated,
    but how that determination should be made. The lower courts in this case ruled that expert
    testimony documenting the psychological impact of confinement in such institutions is
    irrelevant to resolving the constitutional question. Our position is just the opposite:
    that the constitutional question cannot be resolved without a factual context that gives
    it meaning.</font></p>
