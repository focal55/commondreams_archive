    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 26 - The nation's premier children's advocacy organization, the <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/">Children's Defense Fund</a>, today announced the
    start-up of a state office in Oakland, California, dedicated primarily to providing health
    coverage to all of California's uninsured children. California has 1.7 million children
    lacking health insurance, the highest number of uninsured children in any state in the
    country.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> &quot;We are so pleased to be on the ground
    in California, joining forces with other children's advocates to make sure that uninsured
    children of working parents get the long overdue health coverage they deserve so they can
    learn in school, grow up healthy, and thrive,&quot; said CDF President and Founder <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/mwe.html">Marian Wright Edelman</a>.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> CDF was instrumental in persuading Congress
    to pass the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the largest expansion of
    children's health coverage since the adoption of Medicaid in 1965. CHIP is a $4 billion a
    year federal grant program that helps states to provide health insurance for uninsured
    children in working families. California is using CHIP funds to make health insurance
    available to about 1 million of the 1.7 million children lacking coverage through its new
    Healthy Families and expanded Medi-Cal programs.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> Under the leadership of Deena Lahn, CDF's
    new California Child Health Policy Director, the office has joined forces with two other
    California organizations, Children Now and The Children's Partnership, to form the 100%
    Campaign, a campaign for health insurance for all of California's children. Lahn brings
    more than 15 years of advocacy experience, with expertise in coalition building and
    policy.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> &quot;I'm looking forward to seeing a lot
    more children with health insurance in California and to increasing the number of people
    who participate in children's advocacy. I like convincing people that they don't have to
    accept the way things are,&quot; said Lahn.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> Joining Lahn is California Field Director
    Kristen Hubbard, former CDF field organizer based in Washington, D.C., where she worked on
    the national campaign for Child Health Now! to help pass CHIP.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> CDF's new office is located at 101 Broadway,
    Second Floor, Oakland, CA 94607. The telephone number is 510-287-9261.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> The Children's Defense Fund also has state
    offices in Ohio, New York, Minnesota, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> The mission of the Children's Defense Fund
    is to <i>Leave No Child Behind®</i> and to ensure every child a <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/healthystart.html">Healthy Start</a>, a <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/headstart.html">Head Start</a>, a <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/fairstart.html">Fair Start</a>, a <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/safestart.html">Safe Start</a>, and a <a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/moralstart.html">Moral Start</a> in life and
    successful passage to adulthood with the help of caring families and communities.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> CDF provides a strong, effective voice for <i>all</i>
    the children of America who cannot vote, lobby, or speak for themselves. We pay particular
    attention to the needs of poor and minority children and those with disabilities. CDF
    educates the nation about the needs of children and encourages preventive investment
    before they get sick or into trouble, drop out of school, or suffer family breakdown.<br>
    <img height="17" src="1space.gif" width="25"> CDF began in 1973 and is a private,
    nonprofit organization supported by foundations, corporation grants and individual
    donations. We have never taken government funds. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">-30-</font></td>
