    22 - Human Rights Watch today urged the United States government to publicly support and
    promote the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.<br>
    <br>
    In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth
    called on the U.S. government to transfer to Spanish judges all evidence it has collected
    on Pinochet's crimes. Spanish authorities have requested that the United States share,
    among other evidence, the results of its investigation into the involvement of Chilean
    security forces in the assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier
    in Washington, D.C. Press reports suggest that the American government has not complied
    fully with Spain's request.<br>
    <br>
    An American citizen, Ronni Moffitt, was also killed when a bomb exploded under Letelier's
    car on September 21, 1976. At least two other Americans were executed by government agents
    after the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power, according to a 1991 report of the
    Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The U.S. government can't sit on the sidelines in this case,&quot; said Roth.
    &quot;Pinochet is wanted for crimes against American citizens, and even crimes on American
    soil. Washington needs to speak out in favor of prosecuting this tyrant.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Since Pinochet's arrest on October 16 in London, the U.S. government has declined to speak
    publicly about the case, calling such comment &quot;inappropriate.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Roth urged Clinton to contact the British and Spanish authorities to help accelerate the
    handover of Pinochet. Fears of disrupting relations with Chile, which has opposed the
    extradition, should not guide U.S. policy in this important international legal matter,
    Roth said.<br>
    <br>
    Roth noted that the U.S. took a strong stand earlier this year in recommending that the
    Cambodian dictator Pol Pot be handed over to courts in the West, possibly Canada. But the
    jurisdictional basis for Spain to proceed against Pinochet, whose regime executed Spanish
    citizens, is potentially much stronger than the case against Pol Pot, who did not kill any
    Canadians, Roth added.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch's letter also suggested that by cooperating in the Pinochet case, the
    United States could help to repair the damage done to its image as a human rights leader
    at the negotiations for an international criminal court this summer in Rome. The United
    States was one of only seven nations that voted against the treaty to establish the court,
    which will investigate and prosecute future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity,
    and war crimes. One hundred and twenty nations voted for the treaty. &quot;One day, we
    hope, an international criminal court will help deter tyrants like Pinochet from
    committing their crimes in the first place,&quot; said Roth. &quot;Until that day comes,
    the U.S. needs to throw its public support behind this extradition. Washington has to get
    back on the right side of issues of international justice.&quot;<br>

    October 22, 1998<br>
    <br>
    President William Jefferson Clinton<br>
    The White House<br>
    Washington, DC 20500<br>
    <br>
    Via Fax: (202) 456-2461<br>
    <br>
    Dear President Clinton:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human Rights Watch urges the United States to help promote judicial
    accountability for the crimes committed during the military rule of Augusto Pinochet. We
    look to the United States to indicate clearly and publicly to the governments of Spain and
    the United Kingdom that it supports efforts to achieve justice for crimes against humanity
    committed under the direction of General Pinochet. As a concrete measure of that support,
    the U.S. can and must cooperate fully with Spanish authorities investigating the case by
    providing all evidence in its possession of these crimes. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The systematic human rights violations committed by the Chilean
    military during the Pinochet dictatorship amount to crimes against humanity.
    &nbsp; Official Chilean investigations have confirmed that more than 3,100 people were
    victims of extrajudicial execution or &quot;disappearance.&quot; Thousands of others were
    victims of torture, arbitrary detention, forced internal exile, or other abuses.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International law-as well the prevention of future atrocities-demands
    the prosecution of those responsible for these abuses. The Chilean military granted itself
    an amnesty in 1978, however, and the Chilean justice system has investigated and
    prosecuted only the rarest of cases.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-conferred impunity should hold no sway internationally.
    &nbsp; Future tyrants must understand that punishment awaits those who commit crimes
    against humanity, internationally if not domestically.&nbsp; The United States should
    therefore encourage and support efforts to prosecute those responsible for crimes against
    humanity.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States also has a more immediate interest in a full
    investigation of General Pinochet's crimes. According to Chile's official National Truth
    and Reconciliation Commission, at least three U.S. citizens were murdered in Chile after
    the 1973 coup.&nbsp; These include Charles Edmund Horman and Frank Randal Teruggi, who
    were executed by the military in September 1973.&nbsp; In addition, in September 1976, a
    terrorist car-bombing killed former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and U.S.
    citizen Ronni Karpen Moffitt in Washington, DC.&nbsp; A U.S. grand jury indicted four
    members of Pinochet's security police, the DINA, including the agency's chief of
    operations Army Brig. Pedro Espinoza and its director Army Gen. Manuel Contreras Seplveda,
    a man who reported directly to General Pinochet.&nbsp; In 1975, both Contreras and
    Espinoza went to prison in Chile for the crime.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The undertaking by Spanish judges Baltazar Garzón and Manuel
    García-Castellón to bring General Pinochet to justice is based on well-established
    international law and practice giving Spain the right to assert jurisdiction over crimes
    against Spanish nationals in Chile.&nbsp; In addition, as those who commit crimes against
    humanity are considered enemies of all mankind, their crimes, even against non-Spaniards,
    can also be tried by Spanish courts.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, public statements by U.S. officials since Pinochet's
    detention by law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom have been disappointingly
    restrained, referring only to the need to avoid commenting on the judicial process and
    suggesting that the matter is strictly between Spain, the United Kingdom, and Chile.
    &nbsp; This is not a question of interference in judicial independence, however.&nbsp; Any
    Spanish judicial decision to seek extradition would have to be approved by the Spanish
    government, and the Spanish government should know where the U.S. stands.&nbsp; The lack
    of public U.S. support for the investigation-particularly given the U.S.'s direct interest
    in the case-sends the signal that the United States is indifferent to bringing General
    Pinochet to trial.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S.'s muted position on the need to bring Pinochet to justice
    contrasts with its active attempts earlier this year to seek to bring Pol Pot to trial in
    Canada.&nbsp; That effort would have required Canada to use a pure theory of universal
    jurisdiction-without Canada having any particular nexus to the crimes in question-while
    the Spanish investigation is currently proceeding on the basis of the murder, torture, and
    &quot;disappearances&quot; of Spanish citizens, a more traditional jurisdictional theory.
    &nbsp; The U.S. should be at least as supportive of Spain's assertion of jurisdiction over
    Pinochet as it was of attempts to try Pol Pot in Canada.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A concrete measure of U.S. support would be to provide all the
    information the U.S. has collected relating to General Pinochet's role in crimes against
    humanity, including the extensive evidence it amassed in the investigation of the
    Letelier-Moffitt murders.&nbsp; We are concerned, however, by reports that the U.S. has
    been stingy in its cooperation with requests made by Spanish law enforcement authorities
    acting under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the U.S. and Spain.&nbsp; A public
    statement by the U.S. on the importance of accountability would also serve to dispel the
    impression that the U.S. does not favor the investigation going forward. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that, just as the Chilean judiciary has been unable to
    prosecute General Pinochet, the government of Chile now opposes the Spanish extradition
    request.&nbsp; But while domestic legal and political considerations in Chile may give the
    country's leaders grounds to explain their actions, international law recognizes no such
    excuses. The same is true of the Chilean government's claim of diplomatic immunity, since
    Pinochet was not on diplomatic mission or in an official delegation temporarily conferring
    diplomatic status.&nbsp; In any event, diplomatic immunity should not be a shield for
    those accused of committing crimes against humanity.&nbsp; Similarly, we believe that
    short-term concerns that the prosecution of crimes against humanity will jeopardize
    transitions by causing tyrants to cling to power are outweighed by the international
    community's long-term interest in making it clear to future tyrants that they face
    punishment if they embark on crimes against humanity.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, Human Rights Watch, together with many governments and
    victims of abuse, viewed the United States' positions during this summer's diplomatic
    conference in Rome to establish an International Criminal Court as a retreat from
    traditional U.S. support for the prosecution of crimes against humanity.&nbsp; U.S.
    leaders responded that it was not.&nbsp; Particularly since this case involves a
    responsible democracy pursuing crimes committed against its own citizens, the Pinochet
    investigation is an opportunity to resurrect the United States' image as a proponent of
    accountability for the worst international crimes. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sincerely,<br>
    <br>
    Kenneth Roth<br>
    Executive Director<br>
