    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 21 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) praised Congress for taking major steps
    to support freedom for Indonesian-occupied East Timor. Significantly, several provisions
    of the massive omnibus appropriations bill make clear that Congress does not consider East
    Timor a legitimate part of Indonesia. The Congressional action takes place amidst reports
    of a major military build-up and offensive in East Timor and a renewed wave of protest
    opposing Indonesian rule over the territory.<br>
    <br>
    The&nbsp; Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998, passed today by the Senate and yesterday by
    the House of Representative s, bans the use of U.S.-supplied weapons in East Timor and
    forbids&nbsp; IMET (International Military Education and Training) aid to the Indonesian
    armed forces (ABRI). The omnibus bill, which reconciles the Senate and House versions of
    the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, also expresses congressional outrage at the
    training of Indonesian soldiers under a different program, JCET (Joint Combined Exchange
    Training) and calls for a detailed report of all overseas military training to foreign
    militaries conducted or planned by the Pentagon.<br>
    <br>
    The bill supports an internationally-supervised referendum by the East Timorese on their
    political status.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This could be&nbsp; the most support any Congress has shown for East Timorese rights
    of East Timorese rights since Indonesia first invaded in 1975,&quot; said Lynn
    Fredriksson, Washington Representative for ETAN. &quot;This bill makes clear to President
    Habibie and the Indonesian military that the occupation of East Timor is unacceptable to
    Congress, and that Congress wants to see a just and peaceful end to the military
    occupation that has claimed over 200,000 East Timorese lives.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The legislation requires that any agreement to sell weapons to Indonesia &quot;state that
    the United States expects that the items will not be used in East Timor.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The manager's statement accompanying the appropriations bill expresses full congressional
    support for &quot;an internationally...supervised referendum to determine a comprehensive
    settlement of the political status of East Timor.&quot; This has been the central demand
    of the East Timorese since before Indonesian troops invaded and occupied their country in
    1975.<br>
    <br>
    The bill continues the ban on IMET, allowing only expanded&nbsp; IMET.&nbsp; Expanded IMET
    is supposed to be restricted to classroom training in matters such as civilian-military
    relations. <br>
    <br>
    The accompanying language also says that Congress was &quot;very disturbed&quot; that ABRI
    had received military training&nbsp; through JCET, calling the training &quot;certainly
    inconsistent with the &#145;spirit' &quot; of the IMET ban.&nbsp; Congress emphasized
    &nbsp; that &quot;at the present time all military training for Indonesia should be
    limited only to expanded IMET.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The appropriations bill calls for a detailed report of all overseas military training to
    foreign militaries conducted or planned by the Pentagon. This provision resulted from the
    controversy over JCET training of the Indonesian military revealed by ETAN and others
    earlier this year.<br>
    <br>
    In other congressional actions this year:<br>
    <br>
    * In the FY 1999 Defense Appropriations bill, Congress withheld funding from training
    programs involving units guilty of human rights violations. This provision also resulted
    from the controversy surrounding ongoing training of Indonesian troops, despite a
    congressional ban. <br>
    <br>
    * On July 10, the Senate unanimously passed&nbsp; Senate Resolution 237. The resolution
    urges the Clinton administration to &quot;work actively, through the United Nations and
    with United States allies, ... to support an internationally supervised referendum on
    self-determination.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    On December 7, 1975, Indonesian troops brutally invaded East Timor. The UN and most of the
    world's countries do not recognize&nbsp; this act, and the East Timorese reject it.
    &nbsp; According to human rights groups and East Timor's Catholic Church more than 200,000
    -- one third of the population -- have been killed by the Indonesian occupation forces. <br>
    <br>
    The East Timor Action Network/US was founded in November 1991, following the massacre of
    more than 271 peaceful demonstrators in Dili, East Timor. ETAN/US supports genuine
    self-determination and human rights for the people of East Timor and democracy in
    Indonesia. ETAN/US has 20 local chapters. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">--30--</font></td>
