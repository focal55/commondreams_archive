    12 - Legal worries ended today for the five nonviolent renewable energy advocates who were
    arrested in September for hanging a banner off of a crane adjacent to the meeting of the
    World Energy Council's Congress. The five peaceful protesters had been charged with
    criminal mischief, a second degree felony for which the maximum sentence is 20 years.
    Today, however, felony charges were reduced to a misdemeanor, and each of the activists
    paid a $1,000 fine. Judge Jan Krocker set no probationary period. <br>
    <br>
    The five are: Jon Callender, 31; Troy Jones, 37; Danny Kennedy, 27; Genevieve Raymond, 24;
    and John Sellers, 31.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Houston was just the beginning,&quot; said Rainforest Action Network's Genevieve
    Raymond, &quot;because the problem posed by new oil exploration is an international issue.
    We plan to continue exposing oil's threat to the environment, the climate, and to
    traditional rainforest cultures, and to bring focus to the world's dire need for renewable
    sources of energy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Indigenous leaders from as far away as Africa and South America voiced support for the
    five climbers. On each of these continents, oil and gas exploration has destroyed vast
    areas of old growth rainforests and disrupted the traditional way-of-life in indigenous
    communities. As documented in the Rainforest Action Network and Project Underground report
    &quot;Drilling to the Ends of the Earth,&quot; ongoing exploration threatens old growth
    frontier forests in 22 countries, coral reefs in 38 countries, and mangroves in 46
    countries. In addition, indigenous peoples on every inhabitable continent and at least
    eight isolated groups face an immediate or near-term threat from exploration.<br>
    <br>
    Over 200 organizations around the world launched a campaign against new oil exploration
    last December in Kyoto, Japan, of which this recent action in Houston was part. &quot;The
    next stop on this campaign is the Climate Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in
    November,&quot; said climber Danny Kennedy of Project Underground. &quot;If world
    governments are not speaking about the problem of new oil exploration, they're not
    addressing the root causes of climate change.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Houston is in a powerful position to become the world's leader in renewable energy.
    Companies based there have the necessary capital and human talent, but the industry needs
    to affect a shift away from fossil fuels.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to fines, the activists paid $224 each for court costs, and a total of $5,197
    to Brown &amp; Root, the company that owns the crane the activists climbed, for
    unintentional damage and delays. Original estimates by the company set damages at over
    $200,000.<br>
    <br>
    The defense team was headed by Mike DeGeurin (named Best Lawyer in Texas by the Texas Bar
    Association), and included Rachel Capote, David Kiatta, Adam Moscowitz, Bill Stradley. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
