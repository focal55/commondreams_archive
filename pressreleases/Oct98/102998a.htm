    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">PHILADELPHIA -
    October 29 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Rev. James M. Lawson, Jr., one of
    the principal architects of America's Civil Rights Movement and an associate of Dr. Martin
    Luther King Jr. during the struggle for equal rights in the 1950s and 1960s, will give the
    keynote address at the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)'s Annual Public Gathering
    in Philadelphia on November 7. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The program, &quot;Let Justice Roll Down,&quot; will be
    held at Friends Center, 1501 Cherry Street, Philadelphia from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The
    Rev. Lawson will speak during the Plenary Session from 1:30 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. The program,
    which includes panel discussions on topics of social and economic justice, is free and
    open to the public. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Annual Public Gathering is held in conjunction with the
    annual meeting of the AFSC Corporation, the organization's governing body consisting of
    Quakers from all around the country. The audience attending the program includes a broadly
    invited public from non-profit and social service organizations, educational institutions,
    church congregations and Quaker meetings in the region, and the media. Speakers are
    invited to highlight social justice issues within a spiritual framework, challenging
    audiences to find creative ways to put their faith into action. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We are especially fortunate to have the Rev. Lawson
    as our speaker this year. His role in one of the defining movements of this century -- the
    struggle for civil rights for all - as well as his lifelong commitment to nonviolence and
    reconciliation, hold great meaning for all concerned with building a more peaceful
    world,&quot; said AFSC's Executive Director Kara Newell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Rev. Lawson has been hailed by many for his pivotal
    role in shaping national efforts to end segregation and prejudice against Blacks. He has
    been called &quot; the teacher of the Movement&quot; by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Dr. King
    called Lawson the &quot;leading nonviolence theorist in the world.&quot; Lawson was
    credited with instructing and counseling several people who rose to prominent leadership
    positions within the civil rights movement, including James Bevel, C. T. Vivian, John
    Lewis, Diane Nash, and Bernard Lafayette. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the Rev. Lawson's most notable activities during the
    early days of the civil rights movement came when, as Southern Secretary of the Fellowship
    of Reconciliation conducting workshops on nonviolence, he became the chief organizer of
    the Nashville Sit-in-Movement, which was cited by Dr. King as &quot;the model movement to
    date.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As an activist in the Christian tradition, the Rev. Lawson
    has practiced what has come to be known as creative nonviolence. He has traveled to India
    to study the techniques of Gandhi and has spent time in prison for non-cooperation with
    the draft during the Korean War. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently, the Rev. Lawson is Pastor of the Holman United
    Methodist Church in Los Angeles, California. He hosts a weekly national cable network
    television show examining current affairs through the lens of compassion and justice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Annual Public Gathering also includes three
    simultaneous panel presentations about AFSC program work that will begin at 3:00 p.m. that
    day. They include: </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Toward Justice in a Global Economy</i>, moderated by
        Joyce Miller, director of AFSC's Justice Unit. The panel will cover US-Mexico border
        issues and the struggle for dignity in the maquiladoras. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Building Sustainable Systems: The New Challenge for the
        21<sup>st</sup> Century</i>, moderated by Martin Garate, director of AFSC's International
        Regions. This panel will include a discussion of ethics and development, ethnicity and
        development and also focus on AFSC program work in Cambodia that is rebuilding lives of
        victims of landmine explosions who have lost limbs. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>The Right to Life, Liberty, and the Security of Person</i>,
        moderated by Susan Segall, interim director, AFSC's Peace Unit. This discussion will touch
        on AFSC's engagement with international movements to abolish child soldiers and programs
        aimed at ending the non-military sanctions against Iraq. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The program's title &quot;Let Justice Roll Down,&quot; is a
    biblical reference quoted by Martin Luther King, Jr.: &quot;No, No, we are not satisfied,
    and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a
    mighty stream.&quot; (from Amos 5:24) </font></p>
