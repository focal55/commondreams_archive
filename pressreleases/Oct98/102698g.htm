    26 - &quot;The October 23 shooting murder of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian was a terrorist act
    carried out by those who have declared war on a woman's right to choose abortion. Our
    deepest sympathies go out to Dr. Slepian's family, and to his friends, co-workers and
    patients. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The American Civil Liberties Union
    deplores the violent acts of anti-choice extremists. It is perhaps not surprising that
    when abortion is described as &quot;murder&quot; and fetuses are characterized as
    &quot;babies,&quot; the result is violence against providers and clinics. But this is much
    more than a war of words. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course anti-abortion activists, like all citizens
    espousing any cause, are properly protected by the First Amendment when they speak, march,
    demonstrate, pray, or associate with others in these activities. But let us be clear: a
    night-time sniper attack on a person in his own home is not free speech. It is
    cold-blooded murder. The First Amendment provides no shield for assassins, whether they
    are motivated by ideology or not. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This deplorable act of violence is the latest episode in
    the continuing rash of attacks on abortion providers across North America. According to
    news reports, five sniper attacks against abortion providers -- including the one that
    killed Dr. Slepian -- have occurred in Canada and the United States within the last four
    years. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, in January of this year in Birmingham,
    Alabama, an off-duty police officer died and two people were injured in what is believed
    to be the first fatal clinic bombing in United States history. In January 1997, two
    bombings at Northside Family Planning Services in Atlanta injured doctors, patients and
    rescue workers. In 1994, two young women lost their lives to gunman John Salvi at a
    Boston-area clinic, just six months after Paul Hill shot and killed Dr. John Britton and
    his bodyguard outside a clinic in northern Florida. And in March 1993, we saw the first
    assassination with Michael Griffin's shooting of Dr. David Gunn in Pensacola, Florida. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as surely as Martin Luther King Jr. was a casualty of
    an ideological war of hate, so too is Dr. Slepian, and the other men and women who have
    been killed or injured by anti-choice extremists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We call on all fair-minded Americans to join us in
    condemning this act of violence and in expressing solidarity with the courageous doctors
    and other health care providers who persevere in the face of threats, harassment, attacks,
    and even murder.&quot;</font></p>
