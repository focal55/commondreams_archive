    October 29 - One hundred and twenty-one Congressional candidates took U.S. PIRG&#146;s
    Clean Air Now pledge, promising to support legislation to reduce pollution from dirty
    power plants, invest in clean energy sources, and prevent ratepayer bailouts of failed
    fossil and nuclear power plants.&nbsp; U.S. PIRG began collecting pledge signatures in
    mid-September as part of its ongoing Clean Air Now campaign.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Dirty power plants are the largest
    industrial source of smog, climate change gases, toxic mercury and fine-particle sulfur
    emissions,&#148; said Rebecca Stanfield, Clean Air Advocate for U.S. PIRG.&nbsp; &#147;With
    tens of thousands of Americans sick or dying prematurely from air polltuion, it&#146;s
    outrageous that these plants are still allowed to operate under standards from the 1970s.
    &nbsp; The candidates who took the Clean Air Now pledge will be the leaders in the next
    Congress in making the air safe to breathe,&#148;&nbsp; said Stanfield.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the candidates taking the Clean Air Now
    pledge were 50 incumbents and 71 challengers, 97 Democrats, 19 Republicans, 2 Greens and 2
    who did not state a party affiliation.&nbsp; Each candidate was asked to support five
    measures to reduce power plant air pollution.&nbsp; The following are the measures and the
    number of candidates and incumbents checking off each measure:<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Set strict emission standards for carbon dioxide from power
        plants, consistent with stabilizing the world&#146;s climate.&nbsp; Currently, there is no
        limit on the amount of carbon dioxide power plants can emit, even though they are the
        largest industrial source of this greenhouse gas. 92 candidates, 40 incumbents;<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Require all power plants, old and new, to meet the modern
        emission standards met by new plants today.&nbsp; Currently, old coal-burning power plants
        are allowed to emit as much as ten times the amount of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide
        emitted by new plants burning the same amount of fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp; 94 candidates, 42
        incumbents;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Set strict emission standards for mercury from power plants,
        consistent with protecting public health from the risk of neurological damage caused by
        exposure to mercury.&nbsp; Currently, there is no limit on the amount of toxic mercury
        power plants may emit, even though they are the largest industrial source of this
        pollutant.&nbsp;&nbsp; 95 candidates, 41 incumbents;<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Require increased investment in non-polluting energy
        efficiency and renewable energy sources, which can replace polluting power plants while
        saving money and creating jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 91 candidates, 44 incumbents;<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stop efforts to charge consumers for bailing out failed
        fossil fuel and nuclear power plants.&nbsp; These bailouts slow the shift away from
        polluting energy sources toward a clean energy future, and unfairly burden consumers with
        the costs of the industry&#146;s poor investment decisions. --&nbsp; 88 candidates, 33
        incumbents.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This month, U.S. PIRG and the Clean Air Network
        released a report showing that over 5200 violations of the EPA&#146;s new smog standards
        were recorded in 32 states and Washington, DC during the 1998 smog season.&nbsp; The
        electric power industry is responsible for one-third of the smog-causing nitrogen oxide
        (NOx) pollution emitted in the U.S.&nbsp; In addition, electric power plants are
        responsible for two-thirds of the nations sulfur-dioxide pollution which causes soot and
        acid rain, one-third of the nation&#146;s carbon dioxide emissions, which cause global
        warming, and one-third of toxic mercury emissions, which have contaminated the fish in
        50,000 U.S. lakes and streams.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Cleaning up electric power plants is one
        of the most effective way to curb global warming,&#148; said Katherine Silverthorne, U.S.
        PIRG&#146;s Climate Change Attorney.&nbsp; &#147;We will go back to these candidates when
        they take office, ask them to sponsor legislation that will fulfill&nbsp; their
        commitment, and work to get everyone in Congress to follow their lead,&#148; said
        Silverthorne.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) has
        introduced legislation which would implement all five measures included in the Clean Air
        Now pledge.&nbsp; In addition, separate bills have been introduced by Rep. Frank Pallone
        (D-NJ) and Senators Leahy (D-VT), Jeffords (D-VT) and Lieberman (D-CT), each of which
        would take steps to reduce pollution from power plants.</font></li>
