    October 6 - <br>
    <a name="statement"></a><strong>Statement by Pierre Sané Secretary General, Amnesty
    International</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Today Amnesty International
    members all over the world are starting a campaign to improve human rights protection for
    all those who live on US soil. We are doing this at a time when the US political
    establishment is immersed on issues of morality in politics and society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The concept of right and wrong is high in today's news
    agenda. This is the time, then, to address seriously long standing human wrongs in this
    country. To address the violation of the dignity of the voiceless. Of the prisoners
    subjected to inhuman treatment. Of the members of ethnic minorities brutalized by the
    police. Of the asylum seekers jailed like criminals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International has been knocking on the doors of
    Congress for the past 37 years. We have been telling the US authorities that cruelty does
    not just happen elsewhere. Serious human rights violations are not just a foreign affair.
    They are happening in the US today and -- worst of all -- some are on the increase. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And where is the public outcry? Where are the zealous
    defenders of morality when a mentally ill inmate is shackled to a four-point metal
    restraint board for 12 weeks? When a pregnant woman is shackled during her seven hours of
    labour? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Where is the public outcry at the shockingly cruel
    conditions in many of the nations's jails and prisons? Or at the New York Police
    department's 3 million dollar purchase of the right to kill Anthony Baez with impunity? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What we have in the US political establishment today is a
    clear case of hypocrisy and inconsistency. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The words of a refugee who was detained in harsh conditions
    for 14 months before being granted asylum painfully illustrates the situation:
    &quot;Everyone says America is the place for human rights. I thought maybe I had arrived
    in the wrong country.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A greater focus on the punishment rather than the
    rehabilitation of prisoners has led to cuts in programs and facilities in many US prisons.
    Prison authorities are turning to other ways of dealing with prisoners. Ways that are
    cruel, painful and often life threatening: supermaximum security units, electro-shock
    devices, chemical sprays, lethal injections. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not all sectors of society are equally affected by this,
    however. This is a country were racial discrimination remained legal until the 1960s,
    underpinning a system where black people faced discrimination at work, at school and at
    the hands of the police and the criminal justice system. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a country still struggling to eradicate racial
    discrimination, more than 60 per cent of prisoners come from racial minorities. Up to one
    third of all young black men in the US are in jail or prison, or on parole or probation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You have all received copies of the one-hundred-and-fifty
    page report published for this campaign. The abuses it describes, should shock the
    conscience of people everywhere. It is one of several reports on human rights in the USA
    to be published this year, but only one of many produced by our organization in the past
    decade. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the report was completed, we have continued to
    receive information of disturbing cases from around the country: INS detainees in a
    Florida jail subjected to electroshocks, beatings, punitive solitary confinement and
    prolonged shackling. Use of restraint chairs in juvenile facilities in Maine. Sexual abuse
    of women in prison. Retaliation against those who dare to complain or denounce. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What Amnesty International is saying today, has been said
    many, many times before, and not only by us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A large and very active NGO community in the USA has
    repeatedly raised its voice as well against the persistent pattern of police brutality,
    the endemic violence against prisoners, the punitive treatment of asylum seekers, the
    arbitrary, unfair and racist use of the death penalty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we speak, the State of Virginia is preparing to execute
    next week a young man who was just 17 at the time the offense was committed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is nothing new here. It has all been denounced again
    and again. And that is the reason for this campaign. Enough has been written and said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a perfect symbol of the current state of human rights in
    this country, juvenile justice measures are being proposed that would encourage the trial
    of 15-year-old children as adults. Many of these children could end up in adult prisons,
    where they could face the risk of being raped, tortured and murdered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The truth is that many standards of human rights protection
    in the United States have not kept pace with evolving international standards of decency.
    The United States has one of the worst ratification records of all industrialized nations.
    Together with Somalia, the US is the only country in the world not to have ratified the
    International Convention on the Rights of the Child. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even though the US government uses these same international
    standards to judge others, it fails to apply the same yard stick at home. It has
    campaigned vigorously to block the establishment of a truly effective and independent
    international criminal court. And it continues to fuel violations abroad by providing
    weapons and expertise to governments that deliberately violate the rights of their
    citizens. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International can only welcome at the current soul
    searching on morality in politics. But unless this exercise addresses the central needs
    for the protection of the dignity of the weakest groups in society human rights in the USA
    will continue to be a tale of two nations: rich and poor, white and black, male and
    female. </font></p>

    <h3><a name="newreports"></a><font face="Arial" size="2">New reports of children and women
    abused in correctional institutions Findings from Amnesty International Research trip</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The findings of a two-week research trip by Amnesty
    International in the USA show that the abuse of women prisoners in particular - as
    highlighted in the report released today - is still continuing in many states the US. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The investigation team heard from current and former women
    prisoners, their lawyers and relatives and prison staff about their treatment in prison
    including: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">*women shackled during labor<br>
    *male prison officers assaulting women prisoners, touching their genitals during searches,
    and leering at women while they dressed or showered<br>
    *inadequate medical care </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The team also heard further reports of abuse in a juvenile
    detention center in Maine, which have led in the past week to calls for an independent
    investigation into the allegations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The researchers - who visited Maine, Michigan, Illinois and
    California between 19 September and 2 October - found that many prisoners or prison staff
    were afraid to complain because of intimidation or retaliation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The message we heard over and over again was that if
    they complain, they suffer for it,&quot; said researcher Jo Szwarc. Many of the people
    interviewed asked that their names be kept confidential for this reason. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Details of the investigation team's findings are:</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Michigan</b><br>
    The researchers spoke by telephone with two women in prison who described the appalling
    experience of being pregnant while incarcerated. Both of them were taken to hospital in a
    belly chain and handcuffs when they were in labor in 1994 and 1996; one of them also had
    her legs shackled together. Her restraints were removed just before she gave birth, at the
    request of the doctor and after the guard who constantly attended her obtained permission
    from the prison. The other woman was handcuffed to the hospital bed until the doctor asked
    for the restraints to be removed, just before she gave birth. Both women were cuffed to
    their beds shortly after giving birth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both of the women told the researchers that despite the
    fact that the US Justice Department investigated sexual abuse of prisoners in Michigan,
    and started legal action against the state, women inmates in Michigan are still sexually
    abused by correctional officers. They said that guards sexually assaulted women, watched
    them in the showers or when dressing, and touched their breasts and genitals during pat
    searches. The women also reported inadequate and inappropriate medical attention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International's researchers also spoke with two
    guards from a women's prison, who supported the inmate's complaints. The guards said there
    was a pattern of sexual abuse of women prisoners, with women intimidated or punished if
    they complained. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International's report cites an investigation into
    Michigan's women's prisons by the US Justice Department, which found that inmates who
    complain suffer intimidation and retaliation. The inmates and guards interviewed by the
    researchers said that reprisals continue and that both inmates and staff have been
    threatened and victimized. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One guard said she was harassed after she complained about
    the abuse meted out by other guards and was savagely beaten and slashed by an unknown
    person within the prison, in an area that is out of bounds to prisoners. Deborah LaBelle,
    a Michigan lawyer, has recently filed suit to seek the protection of the courts for
    inmates who have complained about incidents at the prison. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Illinois</b><br>
    In Chicago, the researchers met with three women who had been imprisoned at the Dwight
    Correctional Center. They spoke of the same kinds of concerns affecting women in prison -
    sexual abuse, inadequate medical attention for physical and mental health problems, the
    cruel use of restraints on pregnant and sick women and reprisals against people who dare
    to complain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One woman, who was released on parole this year, said that
    she had been shackled to her bed for the entire time that she was undergoing surgery in
    hospital, even while unconscious under full anesthetic and despite the fact that she was
    constantly attended by an armed guard. She said: &quot;When you go to prison all your
    rights have been taken away. You are given horseshit and you have to swallow it.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another woman told Amnesty International that earlier this
    year a guard broke a female inmate's jaw and the victim was immediately transferred to
    another facility. She said that prison staff then turned off the prisoners' telephone
    system so no one could report the incident to the outside world. &quot;We were in 'the
    Twilight Zone',&quot; she said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>California</b><br>
    The researchers visited California to prepare for a future investigative visit to Valley
    State Prison for Women at Chowchilla -- part of the largest women's prison complex in the
    world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both inmates and a former staff member contacted Amnesty
    International earlier this year complaining of sexual and physical abuse, intimidation and
    poor medical attention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the letter from the inmates, they said that &quot;we are
    in need of adequate medical care, that we don&#146;t like to be pawed by male correctional
    officers under the pretense of being pat searched, which is really being stroked and
    caress searched&quot;. They also stated that complaints about abuse or harassment by
    prison guards are routinely denied - &quot;the appeal is sent back to you unanswered, but
    the harassment will continue&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The letter from a former Valley State Prison staff member
    describes sexual, legal and other abuse in the prison, and concludes with the view that
    the prison is run in an &quot;illegal, harsh and thug like manner&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the recent visit to California, the investigation
    team met with lawyers representing women in California's state prisons, prison visitors,
    and a psychiatrist. The researchers also attended a conference about prison issues -
    Critical Resistance Conference -where they talked to many people who had been imprisoned. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The complaints about Valley State Prison for Women relate
    mainly to the prison's &quot;Special Housing Unit&quot; where inmates are locked in their
    cells for 23 hours a day without work or education. Amnesty International's report
    expresses considerable concern about such facilities, which are proliferating throughout
    the USA within prisons and sometimes as prisons in their own right - the so-called
    &quot;supermaximum&quot; facilities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A California psychiatrist who has investigated these
    prisons told Amnesty International that the harsh conditions can induce psychosis and
    visitors to the facility described women &quot;losing their minds&quot; because of their
    treatment. A lawyer reported that one woman had her stay in the Unit constantly extended
    because she covered a slot in her cell door when using the toilet, in breach of the rules.
    The repeated punishment of her desire for a little privacy had broken her, and now on
    occasion she stands naked and shouts for attention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Maine</b><br>
    In its report, Amnesty International calls for a review of the use of restraint chairs in
    prisons and jails, based on extensive evidence of its abuse. The use of the restraint
    chair - and other forms of restraints - in cruel, inhuman or degrading ways was one of the
    issues investigated by the team in Maine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The researchers investigated reports of these and other
    violations against children at the Maine Youth Center in South Portland. Amnesty
    International had already informed the Maine authorities that it had received complaints
    including the cruel use of restraints, unnecessary and excessive force by staff and
    placing children in solitary confinement for extended periods, and had urged the Governor
    to establish an independent investigation. In response, Amnesty International had been
    told that its information was inaccurate and out of date so it decided to investigate
    further. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A researcher interviewed staff, parents of children
    currently in the Youth Center, and children who had recently been released from the
    facility. They confirmed that there were continuing grounds for concern about the
    treatment of children. Disturbingly, some parents insisted on anonymity because they said
    staff had warned them against complaining. Staff who spoke to Amnesty International also
    did so on a confidential basis, afraid of repercussions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the last week, Amnesty International's concerns about
    abuses at the Center were dramatically supported by the revelation of a recent memorandum
    by a staff member that documented children being placed in the restraint chair for as long
    as 17 hours. Maine legislators publicly called for an independent inquiry and several days
    ago the state Department of Corrections announced that it would ask an external body to
    review its disciplinary procedures. </font></p>

    <h3><a name="Apick"></a><font face="Arial" size="2">A pick-and-choose approach to human
    rights</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite its claims to international leadership in human
    rights the USA is failing to respect the fundamental promise of rights for all both at
    home and abroad, Amnesty International said today, as it launched its first worldwide
    campaign on the country's human rights situation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;All countries, irrespective of their power or
    political system, have a duty to protect the rights of all their people, but across the
    USA, thousands are falling victim to human rights violations,&quot; said Pierre Sané,
    Amnesty International's Secretary General. &quot;All too often, human rights in the USA
    are a tale of two nations: rich and poor, white and black, male and female.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International's campaign will highlight abuses by
    US police and prison officials -- often carried out with high tech repression tools like
    electro-shock devices and chemical sprays -- the arbitrary, unfair and racist use of the
    death penalty, and the growing incarceration of asylum-seekers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the same time, the campaign will focus attention on the
    USA's double standards regarding foreign policy and international human rights
    commitments. According to Amnesty International, the USA's role in establishing the
    international system of human rights protection is in marked contrast with its reluctance
    to submit itself to international scrutiny of its own human rights record, and to live up
    to the same standards that it demands from other countries. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As the world's largest producer and exporter of arms,
    the USA contributes to human rights abuse by supplying equipment and training to
    governments and armed groups known to have carried out torture, political killings and
    other abuses,&quot; Mr Sané continued. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The type of electro-shock weapons produced by the USA have
    been used to torture victims around the world, and are now banned in some Western European
    countries and in Canada. Items used and exported by the USA -- like leg-irons,
    thumb-cuffs, electro-shock weapons and pepper spray -- easily or inherently lend
    themselves to torture or ill-treatment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The USA is simply not doing enough to ensure that
    such equipment is not being used to commit human rights violations. Current US laws and
    procedures are just not addressing the problem,&quot; Pierre Sané said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A good case in point is that of Turkey, for instance, where
    according to reports issued by the US State Department in 1995, there is &quot;highly
    credible&quot; evidence that US-supplied military equipment was used in some village
    evacuations involving human rights violations. Turkey's special units of paramilitary
    gendarmes and police -- two of the forces most frequently accused of political killings,
    &quot;disappearances&quot; and torture -- have used assault rifles, grenade launchers and
    helicopters obtained from the USA. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Responding to pressure, the US government held up a few
    arms exports to Turkey in 1997, but recent reports indicate that further exports have been
    allowed. In April 1998, a US company was negotiating to sell 10,000 electro-shock weapons
    to the Turkish police, despite its long, well documented record of practising
    electro-shock torture. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Given its prominent role in the global arms market,
    the USA should aim for full transparency regarding all transfers, and adopt a Code of
    Conduct aimed at stopping torturing countries from acquiring both the technology and the
    know-how,&quot; Mr Sané stressed. &quot;Any transfer likely to contribute to human rights
    abuses should be immediately stopped.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International is also highly critical of the
    selective approach of the US government in condemning human rights violations in other
    countries. &quot;The US authorities are quick to criticize human rights violations in
    countries considered hostile, but are then unwilling to take appropriate action when
    abuses are committed by US allies or when the USA's political or economic interests could
    be compromised,&quot; Mr Sané said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The US government's long standing refusal to criticize
    blatant human rights violations by Israel against the Palestinian population, its
    passivity in the face of gross human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, and the playing
    down by US officials of the massacres in Rwanda are some examples of this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to its double standards in terms of foreign
    policy, the USA is also failing to deliver the promise of human rights for all to people
    within its own territory. According to Amnesty International, there is a dangerous trend
    towards the erosion of human rights in the USA -- a situation illustrated by some of the
    issues highlighted in a comprehensive report published to accompany the launch of the
    campaign: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A widespread and persistent pattern of police brutality:
    Police abuse is such a widespread problem in the USA, that millions of dollars are paid
    out every year to alleged victims. Reports of discriminatory treatment by police toward
    racial and ethnic minorities are common, and black people arrested for minor offences, for
    instance, appear particularly liable to suffer police brutality. The vast majority of
    complaints relate to police officers beating people during arrests, searches, traffic
    stops or street incidents --specially in inner cities with large minority groups </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many suspects in police custody have died while forced face
    down in restraints -- most often when being &quot;hogtied&quot; with wrists and ankles
    tied together. While a number of police departments have now banned this method, others
    continue to use it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Endemic physical and sexual violence against prisoners: The
    USA's current response to crime centres on the imposition of harsher punishments, and the
    country now has one of the largest prison populations in the world. Some of the larger
    prison units show a high level of inmate on inmate violence -- with guards at times
    inciting attacks or not acting to prevent them. Inmates have also been beaten by guards
    and subjected to sexual abuse, including rape -- a form of torture. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A particularly disturbing development is the growth of
    high-tech security units, where prisoners -- including pregnant women -- are placed in
    long-term or even permanent isolation. Prisoners, many of them mentally ill are frequently
    placed in mechanical restraints four hours or days on end. Despite being outlawed under
    international standards, shackling of prisoners -- including their transportation in leg
    irons -- is widespread in the US prison system. In some jurisdictions pregnant women have
    been shackled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not all sectors of society are equally affected by this,
    however. In a country still struggling to eradicate racial discrimination, over 60 per
    cent of prisoners come from racial minorities. Up to one third of all young black men are
    in jail or prison, or on parole or probation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The death penalty - An arbitrary, unfair and racist
    punishment: The death penalty is now a political campaigning tool in the USA, and it is
    being applied in a racist way. Black and white people are the victims of violent crime in
    roughly equal numbers, yet 82 per cent of people executed since 1977 have been convicted
    of killing white victims. Factors like aggravating circumstances cannot explain this
    disparity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In violation of international standards, execution of the
    mentally impaired and juvenile offenders continue in the USA. In addition, at a time when
    there is a worrying escalation in the number of executions, many capital defendants are
    not receiving adequate legal representation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most US states have now adopted execution by lethal
    injection, claiming that it is &quot;more humane&quot;. But the cruelty of this punishment
    is inescapable, regardless of the method used, and in many cases, inmates have suffered
    prolonged deaths due medical staff having trouble finding a vein to inject the poison, or
    through having to wait with needles in their arms while last minutes appeals were heard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Incarceration of asylum-seekers: Growing numbers of people
    fleeing persecution are finding themselves behind bars after arriving in the USA.
    Asylum-seekers have committed no crime, yet they are often held in jails and prisons with
    criminal prisoners. Unlike criminal suspects, they are often denied bail and do not know
    when they will be released. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asylum-seekers held in these conditions are not
    differentiated from other inmates: they are often held in inhumane conditions, strip
    searched, shackled, chained and verbally or physically abused. They are often prevented
    from meeting with their lawyers, interpreters and asylum organizations. Women
    asylum-seekers are more likely than men to be detained with criminals, and there is a lack
    of alternative accommodation for children -- who according to international law should be
    kept together with their families and never be held in detention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reluctance to abide by international standards: The level
    of human rights protection recognized in US law often falls short of some of the minimum
    standards set down in international treaties, and important internationally recognized
    rights and standards are not always reflected in domestic US law -- like the ban on using
    the death penalty against juvenile offenders. People in the USA whose rights have been
    violated are also being denied the possibility of recourse to international protection
    mechanisms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International will call on the US authorities to
    put an end to their selective approach in the application of international law at home and
    abroad, and to adjust the country's legislation to conform with international standards. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In particular, the USA should ratify without reservations
    all international human rights treaties -- specially the Convention on the Eradication of
    all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
    and the American Convention on Human Rights -- and withdraw its reservations to the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;How can a country that has so far refused to ratify
    international human rights treaties destined to protect the welfare of women and children,
    for instance, aim to set an example to the international community in the area of human
    rights?&quot; Mr Sané asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;How can the international community send a clear
    message that acts of genocide and other crimes against humanity will not be tolerated when
    a world leading country like the USA is actively opposing the creation of a truly
    independent and effective International Criminal Court?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International's call for greater respect for human
    rights in the USA is part of a campaign to promote those rights for all people in all
    countries. The organization stresses that by failing to deliver to many of their people
    the wealth of civil and political rights guaranteed under international law -- as well as
    the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- the US federal and state authorities are
    also failing to recognize the importance of those rights in other countries. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USA has little room for complacency in terms of human
    rights, both in terms of some sectors of US society and of the country's role in the
    international arena,&quot; Mr Sané explained. &quot;It is time for the US government to
    put an end to its selective approach to human rights, and to start to adjust its conduct
    and legislation to conform with international human rights principles,&quot; Mr Sané
    said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Starting today, more than a million Amnesty
    International members worldwide will be calling for a renewed commitment by the US
    authorities to placing humans rights protection at the heart of US domestic and foreign
    policy,&quot; Pierre Sané concluded. </font></p>

    <h3><a name="hightech"></a><font face="Arial" size="2">Human rights in the USA: World
    leader in high tech repression</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thousands of people across the USA are falling victim to
    human rights violations, often carried out with high tech repression tools: electro-shock
    devices, chemical sprays and lethal injections, Amnesty International said today, as it
    launched its first worldwide campaign on the country&#146;s human rights situation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Law enforcement officials in the USA -- from police
    to prison staff -- have a huge array of equipment at their disposal which at times is
    contributing to human rights violations,&quot; said Pierre Sané, Amnesty International's
    Secretary General. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A greater focus on the punishment rather than the
    rehabilitation of prisoners has led to cuts in programs, facilities and treatments in many
    prisons -- with prison authorities turning to other ways of controlling prisoners.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This trend has been marked by the use of mechanical
    restraints -- four-point, steel-framed restraint chairs and boards, chains or leg-irons --
    plus a growth in the use of high tech repression methods, some of which are cruel, painful
    and often life-threatening. They range from supermaximum security units, stun guns and
    tasers to execution by lethal injection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As part of our campaign, we'll be calling on the US
    authorities to immediately ban the use of stun belts -- one of the most worrying
    electro-shock devices,&quot; Mr Sané said. &quot;The stun belt is, by its very nature, an
    instrument designed to instill fear and pain. Even if the button is never pressed, the
    constant threat of such a jolt is inhumane -- and one of the most patent symbols of the
    current dangerous trend towards the erosion of basic human rights in the USA.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The use of stun belts came to the fore in June this year,
    when a California judge ordered its use against a defendant who had repeatedly interrupted
    her in a court proceeding. The belt --which a guard can activate at the push of a button
    -- inflicts a powerful electric current, causing severe pain and instant incapacitation.
    According to the manufacturer's literature, the belt will knock prisoners to the ground
    and may cause them to involuntarily defecate or urinate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prisoners are not the only victims of these high tech
    methods. Police officers in some areas -- particularly California -- also resort to stun
    guns or tasers to incapacitate a suspect, and at least 3,000 police departments currently
    use pepper spray despite mounting concern about its health risks -- particularly for
    people with asthma or heart conditions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Pepper spray has been cruelly used on people already
    restrained -- liquid pepper spray has been dabbed in the eyes of demonstrators and sprayed
    on the genitals of a protester -- which is tantamount to torture,&quot; Amnesty
    International argues. &quot;People have died after receiving high voltage jolts from
    electro-shock weapons.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The US authorities must urgently review the use of
    pepper spray, and suspend the use of electro-shock weapons pending an independent and
    impartial review,&quot; Mr Sané stressed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">High-tech repression methods are just part of a wide range
    of issues Amnesty International will be highlighting during the campaign. According to Mr
    Sané, &quot;sanctions against those responsible for human rights abuses in the USA are
    often inadequate, and there are clear signs that unless urgent steps are taken, the rights
    of people in the country -- particularly those of minority groups -- will be further
    eroded.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International has published a comprehensive report
    of the current human rights situation in the USA, to accompany the launch of the campaign.
    The report highlights: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A widespread and persistent pattern of police brutality:</b>
    Police abuse is such a widespread problem in the USA that millions of dollars are paid out
    every year to alleged victims. Reports of discriminatory treatment by police toward racial
    and ethnic minorities are common, and black people arrested for minor offences, for
    instance, appear particularly liable to suffer police brutality. The vast majority of
    complaints relate to police officers beating people during arrests, searches, traffic
    stops or street incidents --especially in inner cities with large minority groups </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many suspects in police custody have died while forced face
    down in restraints -- most often when being &quot;hogtied&quot; with wrists and ankles
    tied together. While a number of police departments have now banned this method, others
    continue to use it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Endemic physical and sexual violence against prisoners:</b>

    the country now has one of the largest prison populations in the world. Some prisons show
    a high level of inmate on inmate violence -- with guards at times inciting attacks or not

    asylum-seekers are more likely than men to be detained with criminals, and there is a lack
    of alternative accommodation for children -- who according to international law should be
    kept together with their families and never be held in detention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Arms exports</b> -- the US contribution to human rights
    abuses in other countries: As the world's largest producer and exporter of arms, the US
    contributes to human rights abuse by supplying equipment and training to governments and
    armed groups known to have carried out torture, political killings and other abuses. The
    type of electro-shock weapons exported by the USA have been used to torture victims around
    the world, and are now banned in some Western European countries and in Canada. In the
    USA, too little is being done to ensure that such equipment is not being used to commit
    human rights violations -- current US laws and procedures are just not addressing the
    problem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Given its prominent role in the global arms market,
    the USA should aim for full transparency regarding all transfers, and adopt a Code of
    Conduct aimed at stopping torturing countries from acquiring both the technology and the
    know-how,&quot; Mr Sané said. &quot;Any transfer likely to contribute to human rights
    abuses should be immediately stopped.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Reluctance to abide by international standards:</b>
    Despite the USA's leading role in establishing the international system of human rights
    protection, it has been reluctant to submit itself to international scrutiny and to abide
    by the same minimum standards that it demands from other countries. In addition, the level
    of human rights protection recognized in US law often falls short of some of the minimum
    standards set down in international treaties, and important internationally recognized
    rights and standards are not always reflected in domestic US law -- like the ban on using
    the death penalty against juvenile offenders. </font></p>

    will be actively campaigning to obtain from the US authorities a renewed commitment to
    placing humans rights protection at the heart of US domestic and foreign policy,&quot;

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Prison Conditions</b><br>
    The number of people in US prisons and jails tripled between 1980 and 1996 to more than
    1.7 million. The number of women in prisons and jails has quadrupled over the same period.
    (Chapter I, p.7) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In mid-1997 there were 1.7 million people incarcerated in
    US prisons and jails, more than three times the 1980 figure. (Chapter IV, p.56) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over 60 percent of prisoners are from racial and ethnic
    minority backgrounds. (Chapter IV, p.56) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Asylum-Seekers</b><br>
    The number of those detained under the authority of the Immigration and Naturalization
    Services (INS) has soared, rising by 75 percent between 1996 and 1998. In early 1998 the
    INS had &quot;bed spaces&quot; for an estimated 15,050 detainees and the INS anticipated
    that this would rise to 24,000 by the year 2001, when most of the detainees would be held
    in jails. (Chapter V, p.89) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Death Penalty </b><br>
    More than 350 people have been executed in the USA since 1990. (Chapter VI, p.99) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1997 the USA carried out 74 executions -- the highest
    number for four decades. Only China, Saudi Arabia and Iran were known to have executed
    more prisoners. Over 3,300 people await their deaths at the hands of US authorities.
    (Chapter VI, pp. 99-100) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More than 100 countries have abolished the death penalty in
    law or in practice. (Chapter VI, p.100) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By 1998, laws allowing for the use of the death penalty
    existed in 38 states in the USA. (Chapter VI, p.101) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of June 1998, 43 women remained on death row in 15
    states. (Chapter VI, p.105) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In late 1994 the District Attorney of Oklahoma City
    campaigned for re-election on his record of having &quot;sent 44 murderers to death
    row.&quot; (Chapter VI, p.106) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Between 1908 and 1962, all those executed for rape were
    black, although only 55 percent of those imprisoned for rape were black. (Chapter VI,
    p.109) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Blacks and whites in the USA are the victims of murder in
    almost equal numbers, yet 82 percent of prisoners executed since 1977 were convicted of
    the murder of a white person. (Chapter VI, p.109) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A recent study, made public in June 1998, found that in
    Philadelphia the likelihood of receiving a death sentence is nearly four times higher if
    the defendant is black, after taking into account aggravating factors. (Chapter VI, p.109)
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since Pennsylvania reintroduced the death penalty in 1978,
    the authorities in Philadelphia have sentenced to death more than eight times as many
    blacks as whites. (Chapter VI, p.109) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Blacks make up just 12 percent of the country's population,
    but 42 percent of the nation&#146;s condemned prisoners. In early 1998, of the 26 people
    under federal sentences of death (military and civilian), only five prisoners were white.
    (Chapter VI, p.109) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The overwhelming majority of the district attorneys and
    other officials who make the decision as to whether to seek the death penalty are white.
    (Chapter VI, p.109) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In many counties, black prospective jurors are
    disproportionately removed from the jury pool by prosecutors during jury selection. In
    Georgia, six of the 12 black prisoners executed since 1983 were convicted and sentenced by
    all-white juries after all black nominees had been removed. (Chapter VI, p.110) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In May 1998, more than 25 people were on death row in Texas
    for crimes they committed when under 18. (Chapter VI, p.113) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USA has executed eight juvenile offenders since 1990.
    (Chapter VI, p. 113) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In April 1998, Nebraska became the 12th state to adopt a
    law banning the execution of mentally retarded prisoners. (Chapter VI, p.115) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Twenty-four states in the USA allow for the use of the
    death penalty for crimes committed under the age of 18. (Chapter VI, p.122) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More than 350 prisoners have been executed since 1990. Some
    were children when the crimes were committed: some were severely mentally impaired.
    Another 3,300 people are on death row, put there by a system whose application of the
    death penalty is arbitrary and subject to racial and class bias. (Chapter IX, p. 149) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The number executed since the end of the moratorium on the
    death penalty in 1977 is 467. Thirty-five people have been executed in 1998 (as of July
