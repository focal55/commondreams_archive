    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 8 - The Sierra Club today denounced the House of Representatives for its failure
    to provide contraceptive coverage to federal employees.&nbsp; An amendment to the Treasury
    Department appropriations conference report, offered by Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) would have
    rectified a gross disparity in health care coverage between female and male federal
    workers. The amendment, which failed ona 202-226 vote, would have ensured that health
    insurance plans that cover prescription drugs and devices cannot exclude prescription
    contraceptives from their coverage.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is an issue of equity and fairness, as well as environmental
    sustainability,&quot; emphasized Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.
    &quot;The Sierra Club believes that universal access to a full range of family-planning
    and reproductive health services, in tandem with programs that empower women, are
    necessary to achieving a stable population level in the U.S. and abroad so that we can
    protect our environment for future generations.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A recent report noted that U.S. women earn 75 cents for every dollar that men earn, yet
    women of child-bearing age pay 68% more than men in health care costs --- mostly related
    to reproductive health care. Women are earning less, but paying more in health care costs.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Insurance companies are subsidizing population growth by paying for Viagra, yet many
    refuse to cover the contraception that women need to help them plan their families,&quot;
    stressed Pope. &quot;It would be laughable if it weren't such a gross example of gender
    inequity.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Currently, a large majority of health plans used by federal workers cover prescription
    drugs and devices, yet exclude prescription contraceptives from coverage.&nbsp; The
    inadequacy of contraceptive coverage through current Federal Employee Health Benefit plans
    is clear --- 80% of Federal Employee Health Benefit plans do not cover the leading
    reversible birth control methods --&nbsp; oral contraceptives, diaphragm, IUD,
    Depo-Provera, or Norplant.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Making contraceptives affordable will prevent unintended pregnancies and ensure a
    more sustainable domestic population level which is important for the U.S. environmental
    health,&quot; Pope added. More than half of the 6 million pregnancies that occur in the
    U.S. each year are unintended.<br>
    <br>
    The amendment to provide for contraceptive coverage was introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey
    (D-NY) and originally passed both the House and Senate.&nbsp; The amendment was removed
    from the bill in the conference committee that reconciles differences between House and
    Senate versions of legislation.&nbsp; Tonight's vote would have instructed the conference
    committee to put this critical environmental amendment back into the Treasury Department
    appropriation for 1999.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We applaud the leadership of Nita Lowey for introducing
    this legislation,&nbsp; and for standing up for gender equity and a sustainable
    population,&quot; concluded Pope. &quot;Too bad that her fellow Representatives did not
    follow her fine example.&quot;</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
