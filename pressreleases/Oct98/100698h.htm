    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">BALTIMORE, MD -
    October 6 - NAACP President and CEO Kweisi Mfume and 18 other activists were arrested
    during a mass demonstration to protest the &quot;shameful and hypocritical record&quot; of
    the Supreme Court Justices in hiring minority clerks. The protest was held yesterday in
    front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">President Mfume attempted to deliver resumes of qualified minority
    law school graduates to the Justices by crossing the police barricade and proceeding up
    the court&#146;s steps. Mfume and the others peacefully surrendered to officers for arrest
    as a crowd of 1000 spanning all ages and ethnic backgrounds chanted &quot;No justice, no
    peace.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, Archbishop
    G. Augustus Stallings founder of the African American Catholic Congregation, Chief Gilbert
    Blue, from the Catawbe Indian Nation, Ernie Stevens, Jr., first vice president of the
    National Congress of American Indians, Rev. Dr. Staccato Powell, associate general
    secretary of the National Council of Churches, Blacks In Government national president
    Oscar Eason and C. Delores Tucker, past president of the National Political Congress of
    Black Women joined Mr. Mfume in the civil disobedience.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">NAACP Board of Directors arrested during
    the protest included Richard Burton, and Rev. Morris Shearin. NAACP Special Contribution
    Fund Board of Trustee Clayola Brown was also arrested. Other NAACP members and staff
    arrested included Detroit branch president Rev. Wendell Anthony, Virginia State Conference
    Youth &amp; College president Jasper Hendricks, Youth &amp; College Director Rev. Jamal
    Harrison-Bryant, Maryland CDRC Director Jennine Auerbach, Virginia attorney Jeffrey
    Doranz, and Gwendolyn Lewis.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Faith Blackburne a legislative assistant
    for Rep. Meeks, and Dr. Patricia Deveaux of Missions A.M.E. Church in southern Africa were
    also arrested.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Mfume said, &quot;the fact that the nine
    justices who sit on the highest court in the land do not practice equal opportunity
    exposes a great deal of hypocrisy.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The rally coincided with the opening day of
    the court&#146;s 1998-1999 session. It marked the second year in a row, no African
    Americans were hired as clerks. The current justices have hired only 7 Blacks out of a
    total of 428 clerks. Also, only 1% hired were Latino, 4% Asian and only one-fourth of the
    clerks hired were women. Furthermore in the 200 year history of the Supreme Court, no
    Native Americans have ever received a clerkship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Supreme Court law clerks wield a great amount of
    power by having the ear of the justices. The clerks&#146; influence on both the cases
    heard and the opinions written by the court is tremendous and can not be underestimated as
    we review the recent decisions by this activist court that has narrowed opportunity for
    people of color, affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act,&quot; said Mfume.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A cross section of national organizations representing
    labor, religious, legal and advocacy groups participated in the demonstration. The
    National Bar Association, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the National Asian
    Pacific American Bar Association and the Native American Bar Association pledged support
    to the NAACP in this effort. Representatives from the United Auto Workers, the National
    Organization for Women, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the
    Native American Rights Fund were also present.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those arrested were charged with violating Title 40 of the
    United States Code &#150; unlawful entry on the grounds of the Supreme Court. They plead
    guilty before a judge at D.C. Superior Court who suspended sentencing, ordered no
    probation but issued each a $50 fine that was paid and goes to support the DC Victim&#146;s
    Rights Fund.</font></p>
