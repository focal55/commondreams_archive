    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - October
    9 - Human Rights Watch is calling on the United Nations to dismiss a top general in the
    U.N. observer forces who was involved in human rights abuses in Chile. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan, the organization
    requested the removal of Brigadier-General Sergio Espinoza Davies as head of the United
    Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) because of his role as a
    member of secretive &quot;war tribunals&quot; which judged political opponents during the
    Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. In one case in October 1973, Espinoza's tribunal sentenced
    six socialist leaders to death after an irregular proceeding. Four of the men were
    executed the next morning. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">UNMOGIP is deployed on the ceasefire line between India and
    Pakistan in the State of Jammu and Kashmir to monitor the observance of the ceasefire of
    December 1971. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because of his role in the tribunals, Brigadier-General
    Espinoza is &quot;unfit to lead a peacekeeping mission that seeks to uphold the
    international human rights principles upon which the United Nations was founded,&quot;
    said Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's representative to the United Nations. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">H.E. Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan<br>
    United Nations Headquarters - S-3800<br>
    New York, N.Y. 10017 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Mr. Secretary General, </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are writing to urge you to remove Chilean Brig.-Gen.
    Sergio Espinoza Davies as Chief Military Observer of the United Nations Military Observer
    Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). Reliable public information reveals that
    Brigadier-General Espinoza participated in grave abuses of human rights during the
    Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shortly after the September 1973 coup in Chile,
    Brigadier-General Espinoza, then a captain, served on at least one war tribunal
    (&quot;consejo de guerra&quot;) that sentenced individuals to prison and death after
    proceedings that violated the most fundamental judicial guarantees of due process. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation
    found that judges on the war tribunals had an &quot;unsatisfactory level of ... knowledge
    of basic principles of law&quot; and that &quot;most of them were not lawyers.&quot; After
    a careful analysis of several cases involving the war tribunals, the Commission concluded
    that &quot;in many of the deaths said to have followed from a decision by a war tribunal
    it should be assumed that no such trial took place and that this was simply a way of
    explaining an illegal execution.&quot; In other words, the tribunals were used as a facade
    to justify extrajudicial killings. Moreover, in cases in which a process did take place,
    the Commission found specific &quot;irregularities in both substance and form&quot;
    leading it to &quot;regard all the deaths to which they led as human rights
    violations.&quot; [See Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and
    Reconciliation, Vol. 1, Notre Dame, Indiana: Center for Civil &amp; Human Rights, Notre
    Dame Law School, 1993, pp.139 and 259.] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Brigadier-General Espinoza directly participated in the
    violations committed by Chile's abusive war tribunals. In one case on October 29, 1973,
    the Pisagua war tribunal on which Espinoza sat sentenced to death for treason six leaders
    of the Socialist Party of Iquique. (A copy of the tribunal's judgment is attached.) Four
    of the condemned men were immediately executed. Their bodies have never been accounted
    for. According to the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation, in addition
    to the irregularities which pervaded all war tribunals, the Pisagua death sentences in
    which Espinoza participated suffered from a particular &quot;lack of legality&quot;
    because the verdicts were not unanimous (though Espinoza voted for the death penalty), the
    crimes were not proven, the crimes were alleged to have occurred before a state of war was
    declared, and because the &quot;sole method of proof cited in the judgment to substantiate
    the participation of the condemned men in the crimes in question was the accused men's
    supposed confessions.&quot; As the Commission found that &quot;torture was used
    systematically&quot; in the Pisagua jail in which the prisoners had been held, it
    considered such proof to be &quot;invalid.&quot; The Commission therefore found the trial
    to have &quot;violated the rules which safeguard the human rights of the accused.&quot;

    de la Comision Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliacion, Volumen 1, Tomo 1; impresion en las
    talleres de La Nacion, Santiago de Chile, marzo de 1991. pp. 254-256. HRW translation of
    Spanish original.] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A member of this tribunal who served with Espinoza, Juan
    Enrique Sinn Bruno, recently alleged that the tribunal, acting on superior orders, had
    changed its original sentence from ten years in prison to death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because of the secrecy of proceedings, the extent of
    Espinoza's participation in other war tribunals remains unclear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch believes that Brigadier-General
    Espinoza's documented participation in the worst human rights abuses in his home country
    renders him unfit to lead a peacekeeping mission that seeks to uphold the international
    human rights principles upon which the United Nations was founded. We respectfully urge
    you to remove him from his position and appoint a new head of the peacekeeping mission
    with the appropriate credentials. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We greatly appreciate your attention to this matter. </font></p>
