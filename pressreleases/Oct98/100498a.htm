    4 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports98/kosovo/">report released today,</a> Human Rights Watch
    documents the initial stages of the current conflict in Kosovo, and the pattern of
    Yugoslav government atrocities against ethnic Albanians in the region from February to
    early September 1998. The report provides detailed evidence of serious breaches of
    international law, showing that Serbian special police and Yugoslav army units have
    executed civilians, systematically destroy ed civilian property, and attacked humanitarian
    aid workers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report also describes how the ethnic Albanian
    insurgency, the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA), has violated the laws of war by taking
    civilian hostages and committing summary executions. While emphatically condemning these
    acts, the report also notes that they have occurred on a lesser scale than those
    attributable to government forces. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It's been clear for seven months that the government
    is conducting a brutal war against civilians in Kosovo,&quot; said Holly Cartner,
    executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch.
    &quot;But they are operating in a climate of impunity. The atrocities we see today are
    taking place because the West failed to respond forcefully enough to Serb aggression from
    the very begi nning.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report condemns the Yugoslav government for restricting
    the ability of humanitarian aid workers adequately to treat the 250,000 people who have
    fled attacks on their villages. Many of these internally displaced people are women and
    children living without shelter in the mountains and woods, where harsh winter conditions
    are expected in coming weeks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Yugoslav government has also restricted the work of
    domestic and foreign journalists who seek to report the atrocities. Some ethnic Albanian
    journalists have been threatened, detained, or beaten by the police, and independent Serb
    media have been labeled &quot;traitors&quot; or threatened with legal action for objective
    reporting on Kosovo. &quot;The Yugoslav government is trying to silence critical voices of
    any ethnic origin,&quot; said Cartner. &quot;It wants to turn the media into propaganda
    tools for inciting Serb nationalism.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report says at least one hundred ethnic Albanians have
    &quot;disappeared&quot; in Kosovo since February 1998, about half of whom were last seen
    in the custody of the police. On October 1, the Serbian Ministry of Justice announced that
    1242 ethnic Albanians had been charged with committing &quot;terrorist acts,&quot; 684 of
    whom are currently in detention. In July and August, detained individuals increasingly
    incl uded human rights activists, humanitarian aid workers, political party members,
    doctors, and lawyers, many of whom were physically abused. The use of torture against
    detainees is widespread, and five people are known to have died from abuse in prison. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report cites as a &quot;watershed&quot; an attack by
    government forces in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central
    Kosovo, a stronghold of the KLA. Special police forces attacked three villages with
    artillery, helicopters, and armored vehicles, killing at least eighty-three people,
    twenty-four of them women and children. Although it is unclear to what extent the KLA was
    offering resistance, the evidence strongly suggests that at least seventeen people were
    executed after they had been detained or surrendered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following the Drenica attack, the report says, thousands of
    outraged Albanians who had been committed to the nonviolent politics of Ibrahim Rugova,
    president of the shadow Kosovar Albanian state, decided to join the KLA. In the ensuing
    months, the KLA, called a &quot;liberation movement&quot; by most ethnic Albanians and a
    &quot;terrorist organization&quot; by the Yugoslav government, took control of an
    estimated 40 percent of Kosovo's territory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first major government offensive began in mid-May, when
    the special police together with the Yugoslav Army attacked a string of towns and villages
    along the border with Albania in the west, with the specific intent of depopulating the
    region. Until then, the KLA had been receiving arms and fresh recruits from across the
    border. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many villages from Pe in the north to Dakovica in the south
    were shelled while civilians were still present. Noncombatants who fled the attacks were
    sometimes fired on by snipers, and a still undetermined number of people were taken into
    detention. In three cases, helicopters marked with the Red Cross emblem reportedly fired
    on civilians. Landmines were placed in strategic points along the bor der, as well as
    along the southern border with Macedonia. Most villages in the region were looted and
    systematically destroyed, and farmers' livestock was shot, to ensure that no one could
    return in the short-run. Fifteen thousand people fled to Albania and an estimated 30,000
    went north to Montenegro. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Three appendices to the report also provide eyewitness
    evidence of atrocities by Yugoslav government forces in late September 1998. For more
