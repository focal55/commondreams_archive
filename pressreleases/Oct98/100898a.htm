    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 8 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports98/colombia/">report released today, </a>Human Rights
    Watch finds that all sides in Colombia's conflict systematically violate the laws of war,
    causing widespread civilian casualties that could be avoided. The report marks the first
    time that an international human rights group has dedicated a book-length study to such
    violations in Colombia. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">José Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of the
    Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, noted that the inauguration of a new president in
    August has given many Colombians fresh hope for an end to political violence, while a
    broad-based peace movement is also gathering momentum. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There are some encouraging moves toward peace in
    Colombia,&quot; said Vivanco, &quot;but it's impossible to build peace in the midst of
    these massive and systematic violations of the laws of war. All of the parties must
    abandon tactics that put civilian lives and homes at risk.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Vivanco noted that 1,250 combatants were killed in combat
    in 1997, but 2,183 non-combatants were killed that same year, for political reasons. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Human Rights Watch report, titled <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports98/colombia/">&quot;War Without Quarter: Colombia and
    International Humanitarian Law&quot; (225 pp.),</a> is the result of a two-year, in-depth
    investigation. It documents how all sides to the conflict have recruited children under
    the age of fifteen as soldiers. The report also charges that the warring parties are
    responsible for displacing an estimated one million people, many of them non-combatants.
    Colombia now has the world's fourth-largest internally displaced population in the world,
    after Sudan, Angola, and Afghanistan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch researchers traveled to conflict areas
    to interview witnesses, victims, government investigators, and security force personnel
    and collected substantial documentary evidence. Human Rights Watch representatives met
    with leaders of all parties to the conflict, including then-president Ernesto Samper,
    former armed forces commander Gen. Manuel Bonett, Carlos Castaño, leader of the
    paramilitary group known as the United Self-Defense Group of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas
    de Colombia, AUC), and several guerrilla leaders. The group also submitted to each of the
    parties lists of violations attributed to their forces for comment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the report, Human Rights Watch concludes that
    paramilitary groups, often working in coordination with the Colombian army, are the
    principal violators of the laws of war. The report offers detailed evidence that the army
    tolerates and sometimes directly supports paramilitary groups in their terror campaigns
    against their political enemies. The army provides some paramilitary groups with
    intelligence and logistical support to carry out operations, and actively promotes and
    coordinates with others, in some cases conducting joint maneuvers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch called on the Colombian government to
    adopt immediate and far-reaching efforts to stop paramilitary groups and arrest their
    leaders. To wage their offensives, these paramilitary groups depend on the explicit,
    deliberate, and systematic violation of the laws of war, including massacres, the
    execution of civilians and combatants hors de combat, torture, the mutilation of corpses,
    death threats, forced displacement, hostage-taking and looting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Guerrilla groups, such as FARC (the Revolutionary Armed
    Forces of Colombia), have also frequently violated the laws of war. They have murdered
    civilians; executed wounded soldiers and police officers; destroyed civilian homes, shops,
    and vehicles; and kidnapped defenseless victims. &quot;The guerrillas have adopted the
    rhetoric of the laws of war,&quot; noted Vivanco, &quot;but those are only words. They,
    too, are guilty of systematic violations.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report cites one guerilla manual that openly advises
    tactics that violate international humanitarian law, among them attacks on civilians that
    contribute no direct military advantage to guerrilla forces. Among the illustrations that
    accompany the Human Rights Watch report is a drawing from another guerilla group, showing
    a mouse-human hanging from a gibbet, a grim warning to the civilians they suspect of
    aiding their enemies.</font></p>
