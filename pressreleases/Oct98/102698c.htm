    October 26 - In what is shaping up to be the least competitive Congressional election in
    recent memory, some 143 U.S. House candidates are heading into the final week of the 1998
    elections financially unopposed, according to a new analysis by the Center for Responsive
    Politics. This is the highest number in at least a decade, the next highest being in 1990
    when 137 candidates either had no opposition on the ballot or no opponent reporting any
    financial activity to the Federal Election Commission. Among the 435 races for the U.S.
    House, 260 candidates - some 60 percent - have a financial advantage of at least 10-to-1
    over their opposition. While the 34 U.S. Senate races are more competitive, 13 candidates
    so far have outspent their opposition by 10-to-1 or more. Two of those are financially
    unopposed.<br>
    <br>
    In the House, only 66 races - 15 percent - are financially competitive (where the spending
    advantage ratio is less than 2-to-1). In the Senate, one-fourth of the races are
    financially competitive. The analysis is based on the latest summary numbers filed by the
    candidates on Oct. 15 and downloaded from the FEC on Oct. 22.<br>
    <br>
    Office Spend Ratio Category Race Count<br>
    House 2:1 to 5:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77<br>

    House Less than 2:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 66<br>
    House More than 10:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 260<br>

    Senate More than 10:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13<br>
    <br>
    Incumbents consistently lead challengers in all categories, with House incumbents holding
    the advantage in cash on hand by a factor of 6-to-1 over challengers. House incumbents
    hold a 4-1 advantage on average over challengers in both receipts and expenditures. In the
    Senate, incumbents have more than a 2-to-1 advantage in receipts and expenditures. In all
    cases, unopposed races were counted as having $0.<br>

    On average, Republicans in both House and Senate races enjoy an almost 20 percent
    advantage in fund-raising over Democrats. In open seat races, this edge holds true for
    Republicans among House candidates, but drops to a dead heat in races for the Senate.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Republicans have dominated fund-raising in open seat races, with GOP candidates enjoying a
    35 percent edge over Democrats in House races and nearly 20 percent in open seat races for
    the Senate. In fact, the only categories in which Democrats lead Republicans are in the
    Senate, where, on average, they have 12 percent more cash on hand among challengers, and
    nine percent higher spending in open seat races. The Republicans hold the greatest
    advantage among challengers running for the Senate, with an overwhelming 41 percent edge
    against the Democrats in total receipts, influenced in large part by the nearly $14.5
    million raised by Peter G. Fitzgerald (R-Ill.). Fitzgeraldis the only Senate challenger to
    raise more than his incumbent opponent.<br>
    <br>
    The candidate with the highest receipts by far is veteran fund-raiser and former NRSC
    Chairman, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), with more than $25 million raised since 1993.
    The second largest war chest belongs to Fitzgerald who has raised almost $14.5 million in
    his largely self-financed challenge to unseat incumbent Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.).
    Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) comes in a close third, having raised nearly $13 million in
    her battle to fend off a strong challenge by Republican candidate Matt Fong.<br>
    <br>
    In House races, Speaker Newt Gingrich has held a steady lead in fund-raising this cycle,
    with receipts of nearly $6 million in the latest reports filed, in spite of a weak
    challenge by Democrat Gary 'Bats' Pelphrey who has raised only $16,000 to date. House
    Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is again among the top House fund-raisers this
    cycle, having raised more than $4.6 million dollars this cycle, more than 23 times the
    amount raised by his Republican opponent.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">-30-</font></td>
