    1 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch today interviewed the sole
    survivor of a September 26 summary execution of thirteen men by Serbian police. The
    witness gave a coherent and credible account of the summary execution which was
    corroborated by the evidence found at the execution site and the testimony of another
    witness interviewed by Human Rights Watch on September 29. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch expressed serious concern today about
    the safety of the survivor in light of the Serbian police presence in the region, and
    called upon the international community to take the necessary steps to relocate this
    important witness to a safe location. Furthermore, the man has a severe and infected
    gunshot wound on his upper left leg, as well as gunshot wounds on his left arm, and is in
    need of immediate medical attention. &quot;The survivor is a credible witness to a summary
    execution, and the ability to bring the perpetrators of this serious war crime to justice
    hinges on his safety,&quot; said Holly Cartner. &quot;The international community must
    take immediate steps to insure that he is safe and his testimony is preserved.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During an interview today, he told Human Rights Watch that
    the inhabitants of his village Golubovac in the Drenica region of Kosovo had fled into the
    nearby forest on Friday morning after Yugoslav forces began shelling around the
    neighboring village of Cerovik. The villagers spent the night in the forest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the survivor, Serb police sent several elderly
    ethnic Albanian villagers who had remained in Golubovac to the forest on Saturday morning
    to tell the civilians taking shelter there that it was safe for them to return home. When
    they attempted to return, they were then gathered in a field by a group of about thirty or
    forty police officers, and the men were separated from the women and children. The police
    initially chose about twenty-five men from the larger group of men, but then narrowed this
    group down to fourteen men who, according to the survivor, would later be lined up and
    shot. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The survivor told Human Rights Watch that the fourteen were
    beaten with fists and rifles and kicked with boots while being questioned by Serb police
    about ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The process of separating the men and
    their subsequent interrogation lasted for about two hours. The men were then taken to the
    road next to the execution site, where they were forced to crouch with their hands behind
    their backs for an extended period of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The survivor told Human Rights Watch that the men were then
    led into a garden and ordered to lie flat on the ground, face down with their hands behind
    their backs. They were told that if they identified KLA members in their midst everyone
    else would be freed. During this time, the survivor reported being beaten on his back with
    sticks and kicked all over his body. He showed Human Rights Watch deep bruises on his back
    and buttocks that were consistent with this account. He also described in detail how the
    men were executed, relating how a single police officer first executed the man lying next
    to the survivor and then two other men nearby. The police officer then moved up and down
    the column firing a burst of automatic gunshots at each victim. Several of the men were
    kicked afterwards and one man was shot again when he displayed signs of life. The witness
    apparently survived because he was able to feign death when being kicked. The police left
    the site almost immediately after the execution and the survivor was helped from the scene
    by local villagers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The testimony of the survivor was coherent and credible,
    and matched the testimony of an earlier witness previously interviewed by Human Rights
    Watch, as well as the evidence inspected at the execution site on Tuesday. Along a fence
    within a family compound, Human Rights Watch inspected many pools of fresh blood on
    Tuesday and found over eighty bullet shells at the spot where the witnesses claimed the
    policeman fired. The site was also visited by diplomatic observers on Tuesday. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch is greatly concerned about the health
    and safety of the sole survivor, who remains in the Drenica region, which is under heavy
    Serbian police control. Human Rights Watch calls upon the international community to
    assist the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in bringing
    the survivor to a safe location, and demands that the Yugoslav authorities and police and
    military forces refrain from any actions that would jeopardize the safety of this
    important witness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The violations of humanitarian law being committed in
    Kosovo fall under the jurisdiction of the ICTY. By taking immediate steps to collect and
    preserve evidence and witnesses' testimony, the Tribunal will not only increase the
    chances of ultimately bringing the perpetrators to justice, but also of deterring future
    abuses. However, time is of the essence if the tribunal is to fulfill its enormous
    deterrence potential. Much more intense and timely attention to ongoing atrocities are
    required. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order for the ICTY to meet this challenge, it must have
    sufficient capacity and equipment on site to conduct an immediate investigation when
    allegations of atrocities emerge. Further, its investigators, including forensic experts,
    must have unimpeded access to the sites of recent abuses. To date, the Yugoslav government
    has denied entry visas to forensic teams, investigators of the ICTY, and other respected
    and impartial international organizations in a blatant attempt to prevent international
    and independent scrutiny of the abuses committed by its forces. Human Rights Watch calls
    upon the international community to assist the ICTY in developing such urgently needed
    capacities, and on the Yugoslav government to provide immediate access for the ICTY and
    its independent forensic experts to carry out investigations into allegations of mass
    graves and other atrocities in the region.</font></p>
