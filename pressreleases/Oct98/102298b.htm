    Electricity Marketing Claims; Ratepayers Pay Extra Dollars for Sham Benefit</font></strong></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 22 - A ground-breaking new study released today by Public Citizen shows that the
    marketing of &quot;green&quot; electricity in California&#146;s newly deregulated utility
    market is largely a hoax on consumers and results in little or no benefit to the
    environment.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The electric
    utility industry is justifying deregulation by claiming there are environmental benefits,
    such as the marketing of green electricity, but in fact the &#145;green&#146; is going
    mostly into the pockets of marketers,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the report, consumers who
    choose green electricity pay an average of $10 extra per month for it. An estimated 75-95
    percent of that cost goes toward covering marketing and overhead and does not result in an
    expansion of renewable energy generation.<b> </b>Green electricity is generated from wind,
    geothermal, solar and other sustainable, non-polluting power sources.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Most marketers are making
    renewable energy the &#145;boutique option&#146; and taking advantage of people who want
    to do the right thing,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s <a href="http://www.citizen.org/CMEP/">Critical Mass Energy Project.</a> &quot;They are
    deceiving ratepayers into believing the extra dollars they pay for &#145;green&#146;
    electricity are actually promoting the greater use of clean, renewable energy sources,
    when that is clearly not the case.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report, <i><b><a href="http://www.citizen.org/press/greenreport.htm">Green Buyers Beware: A Critical Review
    of &quot;Green Electricity&quot; Products</a>, </b></i>reviews the content and cost of
    green power products being offered in California and analyzes the claims being made about
    them. California is one of the first states to open its electric utility market to retail
    competition. A number of states are following suit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The green electricity bought by
    California consumers comes largely from renewable energy sources controlled by utilities
    and is already being paid for by those utilities&#146; customers. The electricity is
    simply being repackaged and sold at higher prices. The result of a consumer&#146;s
    purchase of green electricity can in some cases lead to the extended operation of fossil
    fuel plants and greater pollution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The message in this is that
    consumers should look very carefully at claims dealing with green energy, and they should
    demand policy changes that result in real gains, not bogus claims,&quot; Hauter said.
    &quot;We will encourage the California State Attorney General&#146;s Office to look into
    this situation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report, written by energy consultant
    Nancy Rader of Berkeley, Calif., found that only one marketer of green electricity
    exclusively sells power that is not repackaged from existing utility resources.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The bottom line is, reselling
    utility resources does not result in any additional generation of renewable energy, such
    as wind or biomass power, and so it makes no difference to the environment,&quot; said
    Rader. &quot;Clearly, consumers are being deceived by claims that they are helping the
    planet by purchasing these so-called green products.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other major findings include:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Promised &quot;new&quot; renewable energy content comprises
        only a small fraction of the products on the market.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The resale of utility-controlled resources to green
        consumers cannot make a difference in the West because the supply of these resources
        already greatly exceeds any realistic projection of green demand.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Largely because of high retail marketing costs, public
        subsidies are required to support green marketing. More than $75 million in direct public
        subsidies will support such ventures in California through 2001.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Green product claims cannot be verified without a
        regionwide tracking system, which does not exist.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">False or misleading green product claims are common. Some
        marketers, for instance, falsely give the impression that their products contain solar or
        wind power.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Green marketing is unlikely to reverse the current decline
        in renewable energy production or significantly diversify electric system resources.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most green marketers are affiliated with polluting
        companies and are not advocates of renewable energy policy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consumers have no way of distinguishing between renewable
        energy that is merely resold and renewable energy that truly needs support.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant policy changes are needed to
    make green electricity a larger part of our energy future, Hauter said. For example,
    consumers need to have the right to work with their local governments or purchasing agent
    to buy green power directly from producers on behalf of all citizens in the community,
    making green power both affordable and meaningful. Currently, this &quot;community
    choice&quot; is impossible under California&#146;s utility restructuring legislation.</font></p>
