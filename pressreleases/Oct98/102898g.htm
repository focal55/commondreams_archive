    For Opposing Christian Coalition Voter Guides In Churches: Robertson Calls AU's Lynn 'Wolf
    In Sheep's Clothing'</font></strong></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 28 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">TV preacher Pat Robertson today
    unleashed a vicious attack against Americans United for Separation of Church and State for
    opposing church participation in the Christian Coalition's voter guide program.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Robertson, who founded the Coalition and serves as its
    chairman, aimed his fire at a letter Americans United Executive Director Barry Lynn sent
    to pastors nationwide about the legality of the voter guides. Lynn, an attorney and United
    Church of Christ minister, told clergy that distribution of the biased Coalition guides
    could result in revocation of a church's tax-exempt status.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Barry Lynn is lying,&quot; said Robertson on his
    nationally syndicated &quot;700 Club&quot; program. &quot;It's just that simple....This
    man, as Jay [Sekulow] said, is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is not what he pretends to
    be.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Responded AU's Lynn, &quot;This is a new low for Pat
    Robertson. He is now resorting to outright falsehoods and vicious attacks.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the TV show, Robertson and his top attorney, Jay
    Sekulow, blasted Lynn and Americans United, charging that the group is a front for the
    American Civil Liberties Union and wants to &quot;silence&quot; churches.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Robertson also questioned Lynn's religious affiliation,
    charging that Lynn said he was a Unitarian-Universalist minister during a visit to
    Virginia Beach. Robertson noted that Unitarians &quot;don't believe in the deity of
    Jesus.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I realize Robertson is angry that we are derailing
    his plan to politicize churches,&quot; Lynn continued, &quot;but this overreaction is
    appalling, especially for a man who claims to represent Christianity.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lynn said Americans United has conducted a national
    campaign to educate clergy about federal tax law and to warn churches that they face
    possible IRS scrutiny if they distribute Christian Coalition voter guides.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We've received a huge response to our educational
    campaign,&quot; said AU's Lynn. &quot;That's why Robertson has stooped to the level of
    name-calling and false charges. We won't let it stop us from getting the truth out.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During Robertson's television discussion with Sekulow, the
    TV preacher said that Coalition voter guides, &quot;although we can't put them out here,
    nevertheless are perfectly benign under the laws of the IRS for churches to
    distribute.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The 'here' was apparently a reference to CBN,&quot;
    noted AU's Lynn. &quot;CBN has the same tax-exempt status as houses of worship. If CBN
    can't handle the Coalition's voter guides, then churches certainly cannot either.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Americans United says the Coalition guides are clearly
    stacked to favor Republican candidates. (The Coalition has been sued by the Federal
    Election Commission for illegal politicking on behalf of Republican candidates.) Under
    federal tax law, churches are not permitted to intervene in political campaigns or
    distribute such biased material.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Americans United issued the following response to the
    specific charges leveled on today's &quot;700 Club&quot; by Robertson and attorney Jay
    Sekulow. These include:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Asserting that Americans United is a &quot;front
    group&quot; for the American Civil Liberties Union. <b>Fact:</b> AU has no ties to the
    ACLU.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Misstating Lynn's religious credentials and asserting
    that Lynn was once a Unitarian-Universalist minister. <b>Fact:</b> Lynn was ordained by
    the United Church of Christ in 1973. He has never been a Unitarian-Universalist. (It is
    worth noting that a recent Coalition mass mailing to church leaders called Lynn a
    &quot;so-called Christian minister.&quot;)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Claiming that Lynn and Americans United are &quot;trying
    to silence churches around this country&quot; and stop them from speaking out on social
    issues. <b>Fact:</b> AU supports the right of churches to address moral/political issues.
    But the organization agrees with the IRS that churches may not endorse candidates or
    distribute biased voter guides.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Calling Lynn's assertion that the tax-exempt status of
    Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network was revoked retroactively for improper
    politicking &quot;an absolute lie.&quot; <b>Fact: </b>It is a matter of public record that
    the IRS took this action against CBN March 16. The tax agency yanked the group's
    tax-exempt status retroactively for 1986-87 and required the organization to make a
    &quot;significant payment&quot; as penalty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Accusing Americans United of not complaining when Jesse
    Jackson raised money in black churches for his presidential campaign in January of 1988. <b>Fact:
    </b>Americans United filed a formal complaint with the IRS about the incident.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Americans United is a 51-year-old public policy
    organization that protects religious freedom by advocating for the separation of church
    and state. Based in Washington, D.C., the group has 60,000 members and a nationwide
    network of allied chapters.</font></p>
