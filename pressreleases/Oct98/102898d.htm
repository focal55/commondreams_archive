    Handgun Control Asks Florida Radio Stations to Refuse Ads</font></strong></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 28 - Handgun Control, Inc. today called upon radio stations in Florida to pull
    National Rifle Association (NRA) radio ads now running in Florida that call for voters to
    oppose <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org/www.YESon12.org">Constitutional Revision 12.
    </a> The NRA&#146;s radio ad, which began running today in several major media markets,
    alleges that Revision 12 would reduce penalties for illegal gun sales.&nbsp; The proposed
    constitutional revision, which addresses a loophole in current law, simply gives counties
    the authority to require a criminal history background check and a waiting period on the
    purchase of a gun at a gun show.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed constitutional amendment was put
    on the November ballot by the state&#146;s Constitutional Revision Commission, and enjoys
    support from 60%-70% of Florida&#146;s voters, according to the latest polls. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NRA is reportedly spending more than $400,000 of its more than
    $2 million campaign war-chest in an effort to defeat the measure. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Former Presidential Press Secretary Jim Brady, who has been
    campaigning actively for the passage of Revision 12, responded angrily to the ads narrated
    by NRA President Charlton Heston.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Revision 12 reduces criminal
    penalties?&nbsp; I&#146;ve been involved in politics for more than thirty years.&nbsp; I&#146;ve
    seen a lot of lies and deceptions, but this has to be one of the biggest whoppers I&#146;ve
    ever heard,&quot; Brady said.&nbsp; &quot;Revision 12 will not reduce any state or federal
    criminal penalties for illegal gun sales in Florida.&nbsp; To the contrary, it will add
    new penalties and new requirements that make it harder for criminals to get guns, not
    easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take it from me, giving counties the authority to require background
    checks and waiting periods on all gun sales occurring at gun shows will save lives.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Brady reacted strongly to the personal attacks made in the
    ad on the supporters of Revision 12.&nbsp; &quot;To suggest that I and all those who back
    Revision 12, including prosecutors and police, are trying to &#145;make life a lot easier
    for the criminals who terrorize honest citizens,&#146; is nothing less than a vicious
    insult.&nbsp; Charlton Heston should be ashamed.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s a sad day when &#145;Moses&#146; himself
    breaks the Eighth Commandment by bearing false witness,&quot; Brady said, &quot;and
    someone is giving Charlton Heston really bad advice.&nbsp; Before he goes out and makes
    these kinds of statements, he ought to check the facts.&nbsp; He&#146;s not leading
    Floridians into the promised land, he&#146;s leading them into a wilderness of lies and
    deceptions.&nbsp; If Heston and the NRA win this battle, criminals like the killer of
    three Tampa police officers can continue to buy guns, no questions asked, at Florida gun
    shows.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the attached letter to Florida radio
    stations, Robert Walker, the President of Handgun Control, Inc., urges stations to pull
    the ads.&nbsp; &quot;Radio stations,&quot; Walker says, &quot;are supposed to operate in
    the public interest.&nbsp; The courts are clear on this point.&nbsp; If they know that an
    ad is deceptive or factually wrong, they have an obligation not to run it.&nbsp; And legal
    authorities in Florida have made it clear:&nbsp; Revision 12 will not reduce state and
    federal penalties on illegal gun sales.&nbsp; To the contrary, it will add to the legal
    arsenal that can be used by prosecutors in going after illegal gun dealers.&quot;
