    October 29 - Friends of the Earth today honored Georgians for Transportation Alternatives
    with the Road Warrior Award for their work fighting for environmentally sound
    transportation and land use strategies.&nbsp; The Road Warrior Award, which salutes
    grassroots efforts to halt traffic growth and urban sprawl, was given to the group as a
    representative of a larger coalition of organizations working to improve Georgia's air
    quality and transportation options.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Georgians for Transportation Alternatives has done heroic work to improve local
    communities through better transportation policy,&quot; said Brent Blackwelder, President
    of Friends of the Earth.&nbsp; &quot;They stand out as leaders in the struggle to reduce
    Georgia's traffic congestion and to improve air quality.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Recently, Georgians for Transportation Alternatives (GTA), working in collaboration with
    other groups, scored a major victory by forcing the Georgia Department of Transportation
    to change their plans for a new road in the Atlanta region.&nbsp; By carefully reviewing
    the plans, GTA and the Southern Environmental Law Center were able to show that the
    project plans had changed since they had last been reviewed, which violated federal law.
    &nbsp; For more information about Georgians for Transportation Alternative, see the
    attached description.<br>
    <br>
    Friends of the Earth, a national environmental organization, gives the Road Warrior Award
    on a quarterly basis to organizations or individuals working to stop destructive and
    poorly planned road projects that threaten the environment.&nbsp; The next award will be
    given in Winter 1999.<br>
    <br>
    The Road Warrior Award recipient was chosen by the Road Warrior Award Advisory Committee,
    which consists of: David Hirsch, Friends of the Earth; Hooper Brooks, Surdna Foundation;
    &nbsp; John Holtzclaw, Sierra Club; Laura Olsen, Surface Transportation Policy Project;
    and Michael Replogle, Environmental Defense Fund.<br>
    <br>
    Founded in 1969, Friends of the Earth is a national environmental advocacy organization
    with affiliates in 58 countries. For more information, please see our website at &lt;<a href="http://www.foe.org">http://www.foe.org</a>&gt;.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">-- end --</font></p>

    Autumn 1998<br>
    Georgians for Transportation Alternatives<br>
    <br>
    Georgians for Transportation Alternatives Profile:&nbsp; Founded in 1993, Georgians for
    Transportation Alternatives (GTA) promotes transportation options and land use strategies
    that encourage cohesive local communities and enhance accessibility and livability, while
    reducing vehicle miles traveled, improving air quality and reclaiming personal time.<br>
    <br>
    Together with groups such as the Georgia Conservancy, the Southern Environmental Law
    Center, the Federation of Georgia Homeowners, the Atlanta Bicycle Campaign, Pedestrians
    Educating Drivers on Safety, the Georgia Chapter of the Sierra Club and the Environmental
    Defense Fund, GTA has been working to reform regional transportation policy and spending.
    &nbsp; Friends of the Earth is presenting this award to GTA to honor the accomplishments
    of all of these groups working to make Georgia a better place to live.<br>
    <br>
    In 1998, GTA worked to initiate a federal review process of transportation projects
    &quot;grand-fathered&quot; into state plans.&nbsp; Many transportation projects that have
    been long-planned are grand-fathered so they do not have to face new environmental and
    other reviews.&nbsp; But projects that have been significantly altered no longer qualify
    and the state must review them to ensure they comply with environmental, air quality, and
    other plans.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Working with other groups in the region, GTA was successful in showing that one
    grand-fathered road had been changed and would need to be reviewed.&nbsp; Facing this
    obstacle, the Georgia Department of Transportation dropped its current plans, and
    initiated a review of other grandfathered projects. Careful monitoring of transportation
    plans is one of the ways GTA and the organizations listed above monitor and participate in
    the planning and decision-making process of government agencies. <br>
    <br>
    The Atlanta region has gained a national reputation for demonstrating the downsides of
    uncontrolled growth, unrelenting traffic congestion and unhealthy air.&nbsp; GTA, and the
    organizations listed above, are making great strides to put Atlanta on the track toward a
    sustainable transportation system that enhances, rather than degrades, the region.<br>
