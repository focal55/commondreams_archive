    October 12 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Editor's Note--</b><i>The World
    Trade Organization today issued its final ruling on a US law protecting endangered sea
    turtles from being drowned in shrimp nets. The WTO initially ruled against the US turtle
    protection law last April, saying it was an unfair restraint of trade. The US Trade
    Representative appealed and today that appeal was denied. The following is a statement by
    David Schorr, Sustainable Commerce Program Director, World Wildlife Fund:</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The WTO panel ruling in the &quot;Shrimp-Turtle&quot; case
    constitutes a blow to endangered sea turtles, and against the development of international
    environmental norms and practices. The law condemned by the WTO is a legitimate,
    non-protectionist measure to help prevent the extinction of a critical marine animal. The
    U.S. acted in accordance with existing international environmental laws, and in a manner
    consistent with efforts to build cooperative international responses to environmental
    crises. In this context, the Appellate Body ruling reveals the profound bias of the WTO
    against environmental policies, and in favor of &quot;free trade&quot; at any cost. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The law at issue is an important part of U.S. efforts to
    encourage the use of &quot;turtle excluder devices&quot; wherever sea turtles are in
    danger of drowning in shrimp trawling nets. These devices-known as TEDs-are simple,
    inexpensive, and proven effective. The U.S. has been working for several years to
    establish international agreements regarding the adoption of TEDs, and has provided
    foreign aid to support their purchase and use abroad. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As set out in amicus briefs prepared by WWF, U.S. actions
    in this case were consistent with emerging international legal norms requiring the
    conservation of sea turtles and other endangered marine life. Sea turtles are given the
    highest level of protection by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
    (CITES), and are further protected under the U.N. FAO Code of Conduct on Responsible
    Fisheries and under the Bonn Convention on Protecting Migratory Species of Wild Animals,
    among others. But the WTO-operating behind closed doors-refused to receive WWF's brief,
    and has issued a ruling that {virtually ignores} {discounts} international environmental
    law and the means by which it is developed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Appellate Body ruling also perpetuates a contorted
    interpretation of the WTO's own charter. Article XX of the WTO Agreement plainly states
    that governments are free to limit trade in non-protectionist ways when doing so is
    necessary to protect the environment. But the WTO remains an institution captured by the
    special interests of multinational corporations and free trade technocrats. Today's ruling
    proves that the WTO is simply not competent to decide issues that require a mature balance
    between liberalized trade and the pursuit of other legitimate policy goals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The way we trade and invest across borders increasingly
    determines the quality of life on Earth-for people, for turtles, and for our entire
    biosphere. But the WTO remains badly off course. The Clinton Administration has repeatedly
    promised to help build an international trade regime that does not sacrifice environmental
    and social values to the dogma of free trade. The time has come for renewed White House
    leadership and for prompt action to make this promise a reality. </font></p>
