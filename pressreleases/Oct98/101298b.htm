    October 12 - Human Rights Watch today called for a full and independent investigation into
    the murder on Friday of Martadinata Haryono, known as Ita, a young Chinese-Indonesian
    woman in Jakarta. It also called for better protection of members of the Volunteer Team
    for Humanity who are investigating rapes of ethnic Chinese women. Ita's mother is a member
    of the team, and Ita herself had taken part in many of its activities. Her murder has
    raised concerns among Indonesian human rights groups that it represents an escalation of a
    campaign to terrorize those investigating the rapes; Jakarta police say it is a purely
    criminal case. The Volunteer Team for Humanity, better known by its Indonesian name of Tim
    Relawan, has been the lead organization documenting reports of systematic rape, primarily
    of ethnic Chinese women, in Jakarta and other cities during riots last May. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Three of the most visible members of the Volunteer Team for
    Humanity -- Father Sandyawan, Karlina Leksono, and Ita Fathia Nadia -- have been
    threatened repeatedly since the issue of the rapes first arose,&quot; said Sidney Jones,
    Asia director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;Now there is a murder of a person closely
    linked to their work. At the very least, the Indonesian government has an obligation to
    conduct fully transparent investigations, not only into this murder but into the numerous
    threats and other forms of intimidation that those investigating the rapes have endured
    over the last three months. It should take extra measures to protect members of Tim
    Relawan. And Indonesian officials, military and civilian, should cease any further
    comments on the rape investigations until the full report of the Joint Fact-Finding Team
    is formally presented.&quot; The Joint Fact-Finding Team, appointed by the government in
    August to look into the May violence, is due to make its findings public on October 23. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Members of the Tim Relawan have been called in the middle
    of the night and warned to stop investigating the rapes. Their children have also been the
    target of threats and obscene telephone calls. The threats have come as senior government
    officials have been making contradictory remarks about the rapes, with Defense Minister
    and Commander of the Armed Forces General Wiranto denying they took place, and Justice
    Minister Muladi saying they were widespread and systematic. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of early Monday, there appeared to be many contradictory
    reports about the murder of Martadinata as well. Police said there were no indications of
    rape; some press reports suggested she had been sexually assaulted. Police said the man
    apprehended in the murder, a neighbor named Suryadi, confessed that he had intended only
    to rob the house to pay off his father's debt; rights activists have pointed out that
    nothing of value was taken. In response, police said that in his &quot;confession,&quot;
    Suryadi said he realized that Ita had recognized him and that was why he killed her.
    Police-induced &quot;confessions&quot; in Indonesia are so common, however, that a
    suspect's admission immediately after interrogation should not be taken at face value,
    even less the police report of such a statement. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The explosiveness of the rape issue and of the
    Volunteer Team for Humanity's work make it imperative that this case be handled with
    extreme sensitivity,&quot; said Jones. &quot;It's also critical that any lead or strand of
    evidence suggesting a link to the victim's work with Tim Relawan be fully and impartially
    explored, with the results reported back to the Indonesian public.&quot;</font></p>
