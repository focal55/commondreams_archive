      <tr>
        <td align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pollutants in rivers and
        other source waters throughout Ohio are contaminating drinking water statewide, a citizen
        monitoring project has found. Tap water in a dozen Ohio communities is contaminated—at
        levels well above federal safety standards or guidelines—with pesticides, chlorinated
        compounds and other chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects and other illnesses,
        according to tap water tests commissioned by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and
        Ohio Citizen Action. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A total of 20 different contaminants were
        detected in tap water across 12 Ohio communities this summer, including pesticides,
        components of gasoline, fertilizer ingredients, and by-products of chlorination. A single
        sample of drinking water from Defiance contained 16 separate contaminants. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The results were revealed at the launch of the
        latest EWG/Ohio Citizen Action report &quot;Full Disclosure&quot; at a press conference in
        Columbus today. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Despite vigorous efforts of drinking
        water providers, tap water made from dirty rivers and lakes is often host to multiple
        toxic chemicals, or ends up being contaminated with the by-products of the clean-up
        process,&quot; said Jane Houlihan, author of the report. &quot;Water suppliers aren't the
        problem. Upstream polluters are.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Here in Columbus, the study found 10
        contaminants, including 6 pesticides, an ingredient of fertilizer called nitrate, and 3
        disinfection byproducts called trihalomethanes, or THMs. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the past six years, five studies conducted
        by the California Department of Health Services have shown a relationship between tap
        water and miscarriages. Additional studies by scientists at the U.S. Public Health Service
        and the state of New Jersey have shown a link between THMs and birth defects like cleft
        palate, neural tube defects, major cardiac defects, and low birth weight. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the most recent study, women in the first
        trimester of pregnancy who drank five or more glasses of tap water a day with total THMs
        above 75 ppb had a 15.7 percent rate of miscarriage. Women who drank water with less than
        75 ppb total THMs, or less than five glasses of water per day, or both, had a 9.5 percent
        rate of miscarriages. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In Columbus, Defiance, Delaware, Napoleon,
        Norwalk, and Williamsburg, THM levels were found far above 75 ppb. Women in these
        communities receive no warning when THM levels in tapwater rise above this level of
        significant risk. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Analysis of several years of monitoring data
        for the Columbus water utility shows that the single sample in the EWG/Ohio Citizen Action
        study is just further evidence of a pattern of high levels of these toxic by-products of
        the chlorination in Columbus tap water. In 1995 THM levels were sustained above 75 ppb for
        a third of the year. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1996 amendments to the Clean Water Act
        require water systems to prepare an annual summary of the quality of the water they
        delivered to consumers taps throughout the year. The first of these reports must be
        delivered to consumers by October 1999. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;EPA's highly touted new program falls
        far short of ensuring the public's right to know,&quot; said Jane Houlihan. &quot;While
        some utilities may do more, water suppliers are only required to inform the public about
        contaminants in the tap water covered by an official enforcement standard.&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This standard, known as the maximum
        contaminant level, has only been adopted for six of the 20 contaminants found in the water
        tested. Aside from some short-term reporting requirements, the public has no federally
        guaranteed, long term right to know about 14 of the 20 contaminants. &quot;Major problems
        with EPA policy undermine the public's right to know about potentially hazardous chemicals
        in their drinking water,&quot; said Noreen Warnock of Ohio Citizen Action. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The report recommends that Ohio EPA: <br>
        </font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Adopt tough, enforceable source water
            protection plans.<br>
            </font></p>
          </li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Require weekly monitoring of THMs for surface water systems,
            and mandate public notification when THM levels exceed 75 ppb in tap water at any location
            served by the water supplier.<br>
            </font></li>
          <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizer
            that are found in Ohio tap water.<br>
            </font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, the U.S. EPA should ban the
        herbicide atrazine, the most common pesticide pollutant. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit
        environmental research organization based in Washington, D.C. The Environmental Working
        Group is a project of the Tides Center, a California Public Benefit Corporation based in
        San Francisco that provides administrative and program support services to nonprofit
        programs and projects. </font></p>
