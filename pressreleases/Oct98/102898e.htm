  <tr>
    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 28 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">I knew Dr. Slepian. I knew this
    remarkable man. I knew of his commitment to his patients and of his dedication to our
    cause. I knew of his devotion to the reproductive health and freedom of American women.
    And I knew of his determination and courage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dr. Slepian was a victim of serious threats for years and
    he never backed down. Not once did he think of ending his practice or abandoning the women
    who relied on him so much. Dr. Slepian believed deeply in the constitutional right of
    women to choose and he rightly believed that he was a force that enabled women to exercise
    that right with dignity and in safety. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A dedicated physician, a true ally in the fight for women's
    reproductive health, a husband, a father, and a dear friend. Dr. Slepian will be sorely
    missed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dr. Slepian would want his passing should serve a much
    higher purpose. So let us honor him with renewed commitment to the pro-choice values he so
    perfectly embodied. Let us mark his passing with renewed courage to fight for women's
    reproductive health and the right of women to choose - free from government interference -
    free from harassment - free from intimidation - and free from violence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Coming on the heels of the brutal death of Matthew Shepard,
    the shocking murder of Dr. Slepian reflects a deeply disturbing and increasingly dangerous
    trend of intolerance, exclusion, hatred and disdain for the rule of law. Both Dr. Slepian
    and Matthew Shepard were victims of those who use violence to express their opposition to
    social progress. This reign of terror must be stopped. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Increasingly, anti-choice groups and their leaders are
    using sensationalized rhetoric and incendiary statements to characterize abortion. They
    have labeled doctors as murders, posted their names on &quot;wanted' signs and on the
    Internet, and even gone so far a to publicly justify the murder of these men. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But it is time for that to change. Those who oppose
    abortion must take responsibility for their role in creating a climate where the zealous
    feel justified in committing acts of violence. They must acknowledge and admit that their
    words drive unrestrained factions of their movements to commit these horrific acts.
    Denials and condemnations no longer suffice. They must stop referring to abortion as
    murder. And they must stop referring to doctors as murderers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These are acts of terrorism, pure and simple, and this
    country must condemn them as such. Our outrage should boil over and spill into the
    streets. Law enforcement, legislators, the medical community, pro-choice and anti-choice
    Americans alike must rise up and strike back at the heart of these criminals - not with
    violence, but with swift justice and meaningful action. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those who would do away with the <i>Roe</i> have become
    emboldened - have become smarter - have become a very powerful force in America - with a
    reach that is broader and deeper than we could ever have imagined just four years ago with
    the congressional landslide election of 1994. The freedom to choose is no longer safe and
    the time for action is now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In less than two weeks we must make choices at the polls.
    Let bring our outrage at these killings into the voting booth with us. Let us bring a
    renewed commitment to our cause. On November 3rd, I ask you to step up to our opponents
    and do as they preach - vote your own values. Dig deep into who we are as a people - into
    what we want for our children - into the freedoms so hard won, and now at risk. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If we fail to rally our people into action, then our
    opponents - and the murderer of Dr. Slepian will have won. If we fail to rally to our own
    cause, we will have failed ourselves - and we will fail our future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Let us honor Dr. Slepian with action, not tears. </font></p>
