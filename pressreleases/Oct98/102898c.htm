    October 28 - Today&#146;s decision by the UK High Court granting Augusto Pinochet immunity
    from prosecution as a former head of state is an alarming setback in the international
    struggle against impunity, Amnesty International said today. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This decision is extremely disappointing and dangerously out of step with
    existing international law which provides that there are no grounds for immunity in
    matters relating to crimes against humanity,&quot; the organization said. &quot;It sets a
    worrying precedent for those who commit crimes against humanity using the state apparatus.
    It sends a message that these crimes can be committed without punishment.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;How can there be any credibility to the promises made
    by governments in the defence of human rights if international law is undermined by
    granting protection to those who commit crimes against humanity,&quot; Amnesty
    International added. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to international law those implicated in crimes
    against humanity do not have any immunity as the obligation to exercise justice in these
    cases is absolute. This was established by the Statute of the Nuremberg International
    Tribunal and recognised as international law by the United Nations General Assembly in
    December 1946. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International is urging the House of Lords to apply
    this principle, and thereby reiterate the commitment of the United Kingdom to prosecute
    crimes against humanity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The commitment to uphold international law in cases
    of crimes against humanity has been greatly undermined by the English High Court decision
    today,&quot; Amnesty International said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It is imperative that the UK authorities do not
    endorse the impunity under which these crimes have been shrouded. The UK authorities
    should now demonstrate their commitment to fully cooperate with the legal steps taken by
    Spain, Switzerland and Great Britain to punish these crimes.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These principles have been reaffirmed in the Statutes of
    the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as well as the Statute
    for the International Criminal Court, adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998. The United Kingdom
    has contributed greatly to these and other efforts to create international penal justice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This makes today's decision all the more
    disappointing. Furthermore, it is a flat contradiction to the way the soon to be
    established International Criminal Court will operate,&quot; Amnesty International
    asserted. The agreement to establish the Court expressly gives the Court the power to try
    anyone including former heads of States. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Background</b><br>
    The Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal provided: &quot;Article 7: The official position of
    defendants, whether as Heads of State or responsible officials in Government Departments,
    shall not be considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating
    punishment&quot;. The judgement of the Tribunal, established this obligation: &quot;The
    principle of international law, which under certain circumstances, protects the
    representative of a state, cannot be applied to acts which are condemned as criminal by
    international law. The authors of these acts cannot shelter themselves behind their
    official position in order to be freed from punishment in appropriate proceedings&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The United Nations General Assembly declared this principle
    to be international law in its Resolution 95 (I) of 11 December 1946. These principles
    were acknowledged by the United Kingdom as a party to the Nuremberg Charter which set up
    the Tribunal, on which British judges then served. </font></p>
