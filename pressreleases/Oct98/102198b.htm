    Health: Teens Consuming Twice as Much &#145;Liquid Candy&#146; as Milk</strong></font></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 21 - Teenage boys and girls drink twice as much soda pop as milk, whereas 20 years
    ago they drank nearly twice as much milk as soda. That&#146;s one key finding from a new
    report published today by the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI),
    publisher of the <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/nah/"><i>Nutrition Action Healthletter</i></a>.</font><p><font face="arial" size="2">According to the <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/sodapop/liquid_candy.htm">report</a>, &quot;Liquid
    Candy,&quot; teens drink breathtaking quantities of soda. CSPI released new analyses,
    based on government data, revealing that the average 13- to 18-year-old male who consumes
    soda pop drinks more than three 12-ounce cans per day, while ten percent of those males
    down seven or more cans a day. The average 13- to 18-year-old female soda drinker imbibes
    more than two cans a day, and ten percent of females consume five or more cans a day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">At a press conference in Washington, D.C., the nonprofit
    CSPI displayed a mountain of the 868 cans of soda pop that the average 12- to 19-year male
    soda drinker drinks annually. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Overall, Americans are consuming twice as much soda pop as
    they did 25 years ago. And they&#146;re spending $54 billion a year on it. That&#146;s
    twice what we spend on books.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">In a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna
    Shalala, CSPI urged the department to commission the National Academy of Sciences to study
    the health impact of soda pop. CSPI also called for numerous reforms to reduce soft-drink
    consumption, including more water fountains, soda-free schools, and health-education
    campaigns funded by state taxes on soda.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of CSPI, said,
    &quot;Kids are drowning in soda pop. It&#146;s become their main beverage, providing many
    kids with 20% to 40% of their calories. Soda is squeezing more-nutritious foods and
    beverages out of their diets. It&#146;s high time that parents limited their children&#146;s
    soft-drink consumption and demanded that local schools get rid of their soft-drink vending
    machines, just as they have banished smoking.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, a bone-disease expert at the Jean
    Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, said,
    &quot;I&#146;m particularly concerned about teenage girls. Most girls have inadequate
    calcium intakes, which makes them candidates for osteoporosis when they&#146;re older and
    may increase their risk for broken bones today. High soda consumption is a concern because
    it may displace milk from the diet in this vulnerable population.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Studies described in &quot;Liquid Candy&quot; indicate that
    diets high in sugary foods like soft drinks may increase the risk of heart disease in
    &quot;insulin resistant&quot; adults. Other research links cola consumption to kidney
    stones in men.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and other companies are relentless
    marketers, having spent over $6&nbsp;billion in the last decade on advertising. Recently,
    they have started paying big bucks for exclusive marketing rights in schools and other
    locations frequented by adolescents. For instance, Coca-Cola is paying the Boys &amp;
    Girls Clubs of America $60 million to make its company&#146;s products the only brands
    sold in more than 2,000 clubs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Marianne Manilov, the executive director of the Center for
    Commercialism-Free Public Education (based in Oakland, California), castigated schools
    &quot;for sacrificing their students&#146; health by selling out to Coca-Cola. The
    marketing agreements virtually ensure that more kids will be drinking more soda -- while
    their health classes are discouraging consumption. Taxpayers must provide school systems
    with adequate funds so schools don&#146;t become reliant on junk-food companies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">At the press conference, CSPI displayed baby bottles with
    Pepsi, Seven-Up, and Dr&nbsp;Pepper logos. Those companies have licensed their logos to a
    major maker of bottles, Munchkin Bottling, Inc. One study found that parents are four
    times more likely to feed their children soda pop when their children use those logo
    bottles than when they don&#146;t.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">CSPI charged that soft-drink companies are mounting
    &quot;predatory&quot; marketing campaigns aimed at children and adolescents. One Pepsi
    commercial shown at the press conference shows a young man and young woman with soda pop
    spewing from pierced lips, ears, and other body parts. Commercials for high-caffeine
    products, like Coca-Cola Company&#146;s Surge, appeal to teens who are looking for legal
    stimulant drugs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">CSPI cited bigger serving sizes as a major reason for
    increased consumption. In the past 40 years, bottles and cans have ballooned from 6½
    ounces to 12 ounces and recently to 20 ounces. Interestingly, back in the 1950s, Coke&#146;s
    &quot;family size&quot; bottle was only 26 ounces. The Center dubbed 7-Eleven&#146;s
    64-ounce, 600-calorie &quot;Double Gulp&quot; the &quot;Pop Belly Special.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Diet drinks don&#146;t have the sugar and calories of
    regular soft drinks. But they still replace more-healthful beverages in the diet.
    Moreover, at least two artificial sweeteners -- acesulfame-K, used in the new Pepsi One,
    and saccharin -- are worrisome and may promote cancer, according to CSPI.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Perhaps &quot;Liquid Candy&quot;&#146;s most controversial
    recommendation is that states tax soda pop to help fund major campaigns to improve diets,
    build bike paths and recreation centers, and support physical-education programs in
    schools. Arkansas takes in $40 million annually from its two-cent-per-can tax. Tennessee,
    Washington state, and West Virginia also tax soda, while industry lobbying has won repeals
    in New York, North Carolina, and several other states.</font></p>
