    October 1 - By cutting energy efficiency programs almost in half, electric utilities are
    sticking consumers with bigger electric bills and dirty air, concludes <i>Unplugged,</i> a
    new study by the <a href="http://www.ewg.org">Environmental Working Group</a> and <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org">World Wildlife Fund.</a> </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">To raise profits in a deregulated energy market, utilities are eliminating or
    drastically cutting these programs which save consumers money and reduce air pollution and
    greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, consumers paid an extra $1 billion each year for
    the next decade due to cuts in energy efficiency investments, concludes the report. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report ranked the nation's largest utilities on their
    commitment to energy efficiency programs and found a wide variation between power
    companies and regions of the country. For example, the City of Eugene, OR, whose utility
    serves some 73,000 customers, invested more in energy efficiency than the combined outlay
    of Southern Company, Entergy, Commonwealth Edison, and American Electric Power, which
    serve more than 12 million customers. Forty-two of the largest electric utilities
    completely eliminated their investments in energy efficiency. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Utilities are putting profits ahead of their
    customers' interests,&quot; said John Coequyt of EWG, author of the report, &quot;and to
    keep up with soaring demand, utilities have turned to antiquated, dirty power plants.
    Competition among electric utilities should not come at the cost of higher bills for
    consumers and dirty air.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Unplugged</i> is based on documents utilities must file
    with the U.S. Department of Energy and finds that cuts in energy efficiency programs
    totaled $736 million between 1993 and 1997. The cuts have also meant dirtier air across
    the U.S. According to the study, if energy efficiency programs had been fully funded in
    1997 utilities would have avoided emitting 11 million tons of global warming gases and
    79,000 tons of soot and smog-forming pollutants. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Consumers are getting more than they bargained for
    from their utility companies -- more pollution, and more greenhouse gases,&quot; said Adam
    Markham, director of WWF's Climate Change Campaign. &quot;Consumers want more energy
    efficiency and cleaner air, but our utilities, which should be on the front lines of
    America's effort to halt global warming, are letting us down.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The utilities have eliminated a range of energy efficiency
    programs including home energy efficiency audits and rebates for new energy efficient
    appliances, such as water heaters, light bulbs, showerheads, and refrigerators. These
    strategies are proven to cut energy usage and pollution. For example, compact fluorescent
    light bulbs use one-quarter the electricity of incandescent bulbs. Replacing just one
    incandescent light bulb will save a consumer $50 and reduce carbon emissions by 1,000
    pounds over the life of the bulb. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report recommends all states create a public benefits
    fund in which a small percentage of consumers' bills is set aside for energy efficiency
    programs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the most immediate consumer benefit of energy
    efficiency programs is economic, &quot;far more than electric bills are at stake,&quot;
    noted Markham. &quot;Global warming is a pervasive and ever growing threat to all life on
    Earth and the ecosystems that support it. Utility companies can and must play a role in
    reducing that threat,&quot; he said. </font></p>
