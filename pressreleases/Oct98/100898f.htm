    October 8 - The Human Rights Campaign launched the &quot;Ray of Light Project&quot; today
    at a press conference at the National Press Club.&nbsp; The project will highlight the
    abuses of so-called ex-gay ministries and compile the latest research on the deleterious
    psychological effects of these ministries.&nbsp; Today's press conference followed a press
    conference by the Family Research Council where a national television ad campaign
    featuring &quot;ex-gays&quot; was announced.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Scapegoating gay and lesbian Americans is
    not going to heal what ails the American family.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is going to help is the
    hard work of building a family that is based on trust and mutual respect,&quot; said HRC
    Executive Director Elizabeth Birch in her statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I call upon the Family Research Council
    and their allied organizations to consider redirecting their energies, talent, and money
    on an issue that does not put people in harms way.&nbsp; Your pockets may be deep, but
    your messages are hollow,&quot; said Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
    (GLAAD)Executive Director, Joan M. Garry.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I entered the `ex-gay' movement as a
    sixteen year Pentecostal who was afraid of going to hell.&nbsp; I quickly realized that
    this movement was dysfunctional and cured no one involved,&quot; said former ex-gay Matt
    Smith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Ray of Light
    Project&quot; will invite former ex-gays from around the nation to share their stories
    with the Human Rights Campaign and lift the veil of secrecy surrounding these ministries.
    &nbsp; The project will compile information by leading mental health and medical experts
    on the most recent <br>
    studies available.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is an extension of the in-depth
    &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; report released in August, and conducted by HRC Education
    Director Kim I. Mills. &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; chronicles the misinformation and
    deception perpetuated by religious political extremists about these ministries.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday, October 11th is the 10th anniversary of
    National Coming Out Day.&nbsp; HRC National Coming Out Day Project Manager Candace
    Gingrich spoke of the importance of coming out.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Gay Americans will continue to come out
    and our non-gay allies will continue to come out as our supporters.&nbsp; What may seem
    like a small step contributes to the giant leap we are making for all gay people today and
    in the future,&quot; said Gingrich at the press conference. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participants in today's press conference were
    Elizabeth Birch; Candace Gingrich; Joan Garry; Caitlin Ryan MSW, ACSW and&nbsp; author of
    the book &quot;Lesbian and Gay Youth: Care and Counseling; former ex-gays: Matt Smith,
    Stephen Smith, Tracey St. Pierre, and Brent Almond; Rev. Meg Riley, Equal Partners in
    Faith; and Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG)representatives Neil and
    Sydney Besen.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Right's ad campaign contradicts medical and
    mental health experts who say that homosexuality can not -- and should not -- be cured.
    &nbsp; In August 1997, the American Psychological Association overwhelmingly passed a
    resolution, at the APA convention, that asserts that there is no sound scientific evidence
    on the efficacy of &quot;reparative therapy,&quot; which seeks to &quot;cure&quot;
    homosexuals.&nbsp; In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality
    from its list of mental disorders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the largest
    national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country. It
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"> - 30 -</font></p>

    <br>
    The messages offered in the TV ad campaign announced today by religious political
    extremists are nothing new. &quot;Ex-gay&quot; ministries and reparative therapy have been
    around for decades.&nbsp; However, based on their alarmingly high failure rates, they have
    traditionally been ignored by even the most outspoken opponents of equality for gay men
    and lesbians.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in today's highly charged political environment, the
    truth no longer seems to matter.&nbsp; Their ads are a political device in a difficult
    election season.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Earlier this year, James Dobson met with Republican Party leaders and threatened to bolt
    the Republican party and &quot;take as many people with him&quot; as he could if the
    leadership did not appease his extreme political objectives.&nbsp; Shortly after this
    meeting, America saw an unprecedented flurry of anti-gay rhetoric and legislation, at the
    expense of the business of the American people.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott compared gay people to kleptomaniacs and sex addicts.
    &nbsp; Led by Rep. Joel Hefley R-Colorado, who lives in Dobson's district, Republicans
    unsuccessfully tried to overturn President Clinton's executive order banning job
    discrimination in federal agencies, based on sexual orientation.&nbsp; A vote on James
    Hormel's nomination to be the Ambassador to Luxembourg was also blocked by a few Senators
    pandering to the Right, despite Hormel's impeccable credentials and impressive array of
    bipartisan endorsements.&nbsp; It was in this venomous atmosphere that it became fair game
    to prop up these failed &quot;ex-gay&quot; ministries for the sake of opportunistic
    political gain.<br>
    <br>
    At first glance, these ads appear threatening, a direct challenge to American families who
    have gained a new understanding and learned to accept their gay and lesbian sons and
    daughterts over the past several years.&nbsp; But in embracing these so-called
    &quot;ex-gay&quot; ministries for the sake of political expediency, the Religious Right
    may have made a mistake.&nbsp; They have gambled much of their credibility by jumping on
    the so-called &quot;ex-gay&quot; bandwagon and it could prove to be very embarrassing in
    the long-run.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    All credentialed mental health and medical organizations will tell you that these
    ministries are harmful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only consistent success rate they have had
    is consistently damaging lives by preying on the vulnerable. Each day, desperate parents
    and religious gay people place faith in these miracle &quot;cures,&quot; only to
    eventually find that they were sold snake oil for the soul.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The Ray of Light Project seeks to shine the spotlight on these ministries so people can
    see beyond the rhetoric and hear from the vast majority of people who have been through
    these ministries and now call their techniques psychological terrorism.&nbsp; This project
    will invite former ex-gays from around the nation to share their stories with the Human
    Rights Campaign and lift the veil of secrecy surrounding these ministries.&nbsp; The Ray
    of Light&nbsp; will:<br>
    <br>
    1) Actively seek and chronicle the stories of former ex-gays in all 50 states<br>
    <br>
    2) Share these stories with the public and the media. Compile information by leading
    mental health and medical experts on the most recent studies&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    3) Examine the literature of the ex-gay ministries to look for flagrant abuses and
    fraudulent claims <br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, this project is necessary because these ministries refuse to take part in
    scientifically accepted studies to find out the efficacy of their work.&nbsp; They refuse
    to do so because the results would prove enormously embarrassing.<br>
    <br>
    This project is also necessary because the power brokers behind this advertising campaign
    are disingenuous and duplicitous when discussing their true intentions.&nbsp; For
    instance, Janet Folger, director of the Center for Reclaiming America for Christ, said on
    a July 30th episode of Nightline that the ad campaign is &quot;not really political.&quot;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; But in an August 13th New York Times story, Janet Folger contradicted herself
    and said that she ran the ad campaign because she wanted to &quot;strike at the assumption
    that homosexuality is an immutable trait and that gay people therefore don't need
    protection under anti-discrimination laws.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The Ray of Light Project also seeks to expose the dangerous methods used to
    &quot;treat&quot; gay people.&nbsp; For instance, famed reparative therapist Joe Nicolosi
    told Newsweek in the August 17th edition that he treats gay patients as young as three
    years old.&nbsp; Is it moral to introduce sexual content of this nature to three year
    olds?&nbsp; Incredibly, in their quest for political power, the Religious Right endorses
    and regularly cites the work of Dr. Nicolosi.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The origins to the Ray of Light Project can be traced to HRC Education Director Kim Mills'
    August report, &quot;Mission Impossible,&quot; which chronicles the misinformation and
    deception perpetuated by religious political extremists about these ministries.
