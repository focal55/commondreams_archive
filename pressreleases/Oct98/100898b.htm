    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 8 - Conservationists today warned that the 105th Congress is on track to become
    the most anti-environmental Congress in history, potentially forcing a government shutdown
    similar to the one in 1995. Citing dozens of anti-environmental riders attached to an
    array of spending bills for fiscal 1999, Defenders of Wildlife expressed concern that much
    of this legislation and much of the blame for it will be overlooked or misdirected because
    of recent White House events that have dominated the news.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If the government shuts down because of a presidential veto, the
    responsibility will rest firmly on the shoulders of this Congress,&quot; said Rodger
    Schlickeisen, President of Defenders of Wildlife. &quot;President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore have consistently warned this Congress that they will not tolerate attacks
    on our environmental protections. We want to be sure that the facts are known: Extremist
    members of Congress are trying to use President Clinton's personal problems as a smoke
    screen for advancing the most anti-environmental agenda ever to come out of the
    Capitol.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the various appropriations bills first surfaced
    earlier this year, environmentalists and the Clinton Administration have been expressing
    strong opposition to the extreme anti-environmental riders contained in them. As recently
    as last June, Vice President Gore held a White House press conference to reiterate the
    administration's commitment to vetoing appropriations bills that carry damaging
    environmental riders. (More) Defenders' Schlickeisen represented the environmental
    community at the White House event.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Our environmental coalition has placed advertisements
    throughout the country warning that the possible anti-environmental riders and other
    provisions are so numerous that this Congress may pass TWICE as many damaging provisions
    as the last,&quot; Schlickeisen said. &quot;If one-quarter of their pending proposals are
    enacted, the 105th will rank as the most anti-environmental Congress ever.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One example of an environmentally threatening amendment is
    the &quot;grizzly bear rider&quot; attached to the Interior appropriations bill. If
    enacted, this rider could stop the critical U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service grizzly
    reintroduction program in the Selway-Bitteroot ecosystem of Idaho and Montana. Less than 2
    percent of historical grizzly bear populations remain in the lower 48 states, and the
    Selway-Bitteroot is the largest roadless area remaining in the lower 48. (A list of eight
    other critical anti-environmental riders is attached.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The President is threatening to veto appropriations
    bills because some senior congressmen are having a field-day attaching one destructive
    anti-environmental rider after another to every appropriations bill they can,&quot;
    Schlickeisen said. &quot;They are trying to take advantage of current distractions in
    Washington to sneak through dozens of anti-environmental riders that they know would not
    stand a chance if the public had an opportunity to scrutinize them, or if their own
    colleagues had the chance to vote on them. Today's 302-123 vote defeating the horrible
    Omnibus Parks bill proves that.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Schlickeisen concluded, &quot;We applaud the President for
    keeping his focus and standing up to the Congress to protect the environment.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>A complete list of current and proposed
    anti-environmental riders is available by calling Ken Goldman at <font color="#800000">202-682-9400
    x221</font> and a list of nine follows</i></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are just a few of the anti-environmental riders that
    Congress is poised to enact:</font><ul>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>In the Senate Interior Appropriations Bill (S. 2237): </b></font></p>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The grizzly bear rider would stop plans to reintroduce the
        magnificent grizzly bear into the Selway-Bitteroot system of Idaho and Montana. The plan
        is a significant effort to provide local citizens an expanded role in endangered species
        management. Less than two percent of grizzlies that existed in the lower 48 states during
        Lewis and Clark's era remain. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Izembek road rider would punch a road through the
        Alaska's Izembek National wildlife refuge thereby overriding the 1964 Wilderness Act and
        authorizing the first permanent road through seven miles of congressionally designated
        wilderness. Species threatened include: Stellar's Eider, brown bear, wolf, caribou,
        anadromous fish, the entire population of Pacific black brant and most of the world's
        emperor geese. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Alaska Tongass national Forest rider would allow more
        than two times the amount of clearcutting currently cut in our nation's largest remaining
        temperate rainforest. More than 400,000 roadless acres of remaining pristine forest would
        be lost every 10 years -- damaging habitat essential for the grizzly bear, bald eagles,
        salmon, Queen Charlotte goshawk, Alexander Archipelago wolf, and Sitka black-tailed deer. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The grazing rider would mandate the renewal of grazing
        permits on Bureau of Land Management lands despite incomplete or non existent
        environmental analyses. Millions of acres of BLM public rangeland support endangered
        species, wildlife and their habitat including the Sonoran pronghorn antelope, lesser
        long-nosed bat, cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, Southwest willow flycatcher and Loach
        minnow. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The salmon rider would impede, without congressional
        approval, salmon restoration by preventing needed changes to hundreds of hydropower dams
        in the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Salmon in the Pacific Northwest have dwindled to as low
        as one percent of historical numbers in the lower 48 states and have become extinct in
        more than half of their native rivers. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Various Forest Service riders would hammer away at
        protection of our national forests. These provisions would delay funding to decommission
        or repair deteriorating national forest system roads,stall revision of badly outdated
        forest plans that allow unsustainable logging, and encourage logging in exchange for
        habitat restoration inforests in Idaho and Montana. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>In
        the House Interior Appropriations Bill (H.R. 4193):</b></font></p>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chugach road rider would give Chugach Alaska Corporation
        permission to build a 25 mile, 250-foot-wide road across the Bering and Copper River
        watersheds in the heart of our nation's second largest forest. This road would become the
        largest wetlands development project on the continent, severing as many as 250 salmon
        streams and threatening the wildlife of the Copper River Delta including grizzly bears,
        black bears, wolves, mountain goats, moose,mink, and wolverines. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>In both the House and Senate Interior Appropriations Bills:</b></font></p>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Columbia Basin rider would effectively end the Interior
        Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan (ICBEMP) and terminate a new management
        strategies that cross jurisdictional boundaries such as anadromous fisheries, forest
        management, and natural disturbances. The Senate version goes even further, undermining
        endangered species protection in the 144 million acre Columbia Basin by allowing the
        Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to approve individual site-specific projects
        like grazing leases and timber sales before looking at long-term cumulative impacts on
        threatened and endangered species. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>In the Senate
        Transportation Bill (S. 2307):</b></font></p>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Helicopters in Wilderness rider would permit helicopters
        to fly over Alaska's National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, and Wilderness Study areas
        seriously impacting wildlife. </font></li>
