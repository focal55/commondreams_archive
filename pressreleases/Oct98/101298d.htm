    Requires Safeguards for Consumers and Environment; Consumer Advocates Applaud Bill Filed

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 12 - Legislation filed on Saturday by U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio)
    establishes a federal blueprint for states that choose to deregulate electric utilities in
    the coming years. The bill, H.R. 4798, protects consumers against price-gouging,
    cost-shifting, increased pollution levels and interruptions in service, according to
    consumer and environmental advocates.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The bill is
    endorsed by <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/rage/">Ratepayers for Affordable Green
    Electricity</a> (RAGE), a nationwide coalition of 140 organizations, coordinated by Public
    Citizen, which earlier this year kicked off a grassroots campaign to counter the
    utility-dominated debate over <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/utilityderegulation1.html">deregulation.</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This legislation represents a giant step that
    Congress can take to ensure that consumers are not ripped off by the massive
    investor-owned utilities that are trying to shed government regulation but at the same
    time maintain their monopolistic hold on markets and consumers,&quot; said Public Citizen
    President Joan Claybrook.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) is expected to introduce
    companion legislation in the Senate sometime next year, when Congress will begin serious
    discussion on a range of complex issues <a name="BM_1_"></a>raised by deregulation laws
    being passed by states across the country.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The legislation filed by Kucinich prohibits the ratepayer
    bailout of utilities that made unwise investments in nuclear power plants, many of which
    can&#146;t compete with cheaper power sources in a deregulated electricity market.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I look forward to working with Senator Wellstone,
    Ralph Nader, the hundreds of consumer and environmental groups working together in this
    task, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives,&quot; Kucinich said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The nuclear bailout has become a hallmark of most of the
    deregulation bills that have been approved and are being debated in states, and has
    sparked a grassroots rebellion as consumers realize the impact on their electric bills. In
    California, for example, opponents have successfully petitioned to put <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/restructuring/prop9.htm">Proposition 9</a> on the
    November ballot to stop a state-mandated $10 billion bailout. Despite a massive industry
    campaign to defeat Proposition 9, polls show it is likely to be approved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The bailout is a huge financial windfall for
    investor-owned utilities that allows them to continue operating uneconomic plants, squeeze
    out competition from cleaner energy sources, purchase dirty coal-fired plants in the
    United States and the developing world, and create monster, unaccountable energy
    conglomerates,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/CMEP/">Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy Project </a>and
    a founding member of RAGE. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to stopping the anti-consumer nuclear industry
    bailout, the Kucinich bill saves consumers money by reducing regulation, facilitating
    community choice in electricity markets, improving the effectiveness of wholesale markets
    and eliminating holding company abuses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike some other proposed deregulation bills, Kucinich&#146;s
    legislation does not require states to deregulate electricity markets. But where states do
    deregulate, the bill provides a safety net for consumers. Among other things, the
    legislation:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">creates standards for high-quality, affordable electricity
            service; </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">provides funds for universal service, low-income, energy
            efficiency, renewable energy and worker retention/retraining programs; </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">enables consumers to use local governments to aggregate into
            more powerful buying groups; </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">requires all power plants to meet the same standards for
            pollution; </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">separates regulated companies and competitive companies,
            eliminating cross-subsidies, self-dealing and other abuses of holding companies; </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">limits market share of power plant owners; </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">protects consumer privacy. </font></li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Utilities want to have their cake and eat it too, and
    they&#146;re paying big bucks in campaign contributions to state legislators and
    congressmen to get their way,&quot; Hauter said. &quot;For consumers, the stakes are
    enormous. The average ratepayer is getting sold out by state legislatures across the
    country and this bill is the only vehicle for stopping this massive giveaway to utilities
    and their investors.&quot;</font></p>
