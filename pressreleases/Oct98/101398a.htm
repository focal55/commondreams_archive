    October 13 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The four companies that want to drill
    in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge have a dirty and dangerous track record and should
    pledge not to drill there, according to a new report released today by the Public Interest
    Research Groups (PIRGs).<br>
    <br>
    &#147;The Dirty Four: The Case Against Letting British Petroleum, Arco, Exxon and Chevron
    Drill in the Arctic Refuge,&#148; documents a long list of spills, leaks, accidents,
    violations, and explosions.&nbsp; It focuses on the four companies that have expressed
    interest in opening up the coastal plain of the Refuge for oil drilling and exploration.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;Our report shows that BP, Arco, Exxon and Chevron are some of the world&#146;s worst
    polluters,&#148; said Athan Manuel, director of the U.S. PIRG&#146;s Save the Arctic
    Wilderness campaign.&nbsp; &#147;Their dirty track record is incompatible with an area as
    pristine and fragile as the Arctic Refuge.&#148;<br>
    <br>
    Each company pledges to protect the environment and respect the rights of native peoples.
    &nbsp; For instance, BP pledges &#147;no accidents, no harm to people, and no damage to
    the environment,&#148; and Chevron boasts of a &#147;commitment to preserving the culture
    and environment of the community&nbsp; they [Chevron employees] share.&#148;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; But this brief list of pollution incidents and safety hazards casts serious
    doubt upon any such claim.</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A BP subcontractor near Prudhoe Bay was ordered to pay a $15
        million fine for violating the Clean Water Act.&nbsp; The BP subcontractor was found
        guilty of illegally injecting hazardous waste back into the groundwater at the company&#146;s
        Endicott Oil Field.&nbsp; BP had touted Endicott as an &#147;environmentally friendly&#148;
        oil field.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">BP is responsible for the second largest oil spill in
        California history, a 400,000 gallon spill that covered twenty square miles near
        Huntington Beach, California, in 1991.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Arco is a Potential Responsible Party (PRP) for three toxic
        waste Superfund sites in Prudhoe Bay.&nbsp; Arco is responsible for&nbsp; the nation&#146;s
        largest Superfund site, in Montana, and recently agreed to pay the state $215 million in
        damages and fines.&nbsp; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Twenty eight people have died as a result of explosions or
        fires at Arco facilities.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Almost ten years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill,&nbsp; the
        worst ecological disaster in U.S. history, most wildlife populations show little or no
        sign of recovery.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In February 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
        accused Exxon of nearly 200&nbsp; violations of the Clean Air Act, and demanded $4.7
        million in fines.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The President of Chevron U.S.A. appeared in federal court in
        May 1992 to plead guilty to 65 violations of the Clean Water Act and pay $8 million in
        fines, for illegal discharges from the company's offshore oil- and gas-production platform
        &quot;Grace&quot; off the California Coast.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Chevron has paid more than $70 million in fines,
        settlements, and penalties since 1980, and is a&nbsp; PRP for more Superfund sites than
        any other oil company.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;The public needs to know that behind the oil industry
    rhetoric lurks a long list of corporate irresponsibility,&#148; continued Manuel.
    &nbsp; &#147; Today we call on the oil industry to finally act as good corporate citizens
    and cancel their drilling plans for the Refuge.&#148;<br>
    <br>
    In addition to urging companies to cancel their drilling plans, PIRG is asking each
    company to endorse the Arctic Refuge Wilderness Bill.&nbsp; The bill would designate the
    coastal plain as wilderness, and prohibit any development or drilling.<br>
    <br>
    The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is one of&nbsp; America&#146;s last unspoiled
    places. It remains untouched by roads, development or trails. The coastal plain&#146;s 1.5
    million acres are the biological heart of the Refuge, and support large populations of
    caribou, musk oxen, bears, wolves, and migratory birds. It is also the only area along the
    entire American Arctic not open for oil and gas drilling. <br>
    <br>
    The Refuge is also the home of the Gwich&#146;in people.&nbsp; The Gwich&#146;in, which
    means people of the caribou, have lived in and around the Refuge for 20,000 years.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; They depend on the caribou for food, shelter, and as a link to their
    traditional way of life.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Department of the Interior, oil
    drilling in the Refuge would harm the caribou herd.<br>
