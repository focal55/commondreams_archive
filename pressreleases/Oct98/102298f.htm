    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    October 22 - A stunning proportion of black men in the United States&nbsp; will not be
    able to vote in the November elections because they have been convicted of a felony,
    according to a new report released today by Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project.
    &nbsp; In seven states, a staggering one in four black men is permanently disenfranchised.
    &nbsp; In two states, Alabama and Florida, the ratio is one in three.&nbsp; If current
    trends continue, in a dozen states as many as 30-40% of the next generation of black men
    will permanently lose the right to vote.<br>
    <br>
    Almost every state in the U.S. denies prisoners the right to vote.&nbsp; But fourteen
    states bar criminal offenders from voting even after they have finished their sentences.
    In these states, over one million ex-offenders are permanently disenfranchised.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Any felony can trigger disenfranchisement.&nbsp; A&nbsp; first-time young offender who
    pleads guilty to a single drug sale and is placed on probation can lose the right to vote
    for a lifetime.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;These people have paid their debt to society.&nbsp; It makes no sense to turn them
    into political outcasts,&quot; said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel at the New York-based
    Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report.&nbsp; &quot;No other country in the world
    takes away the right to vote for life.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fifty years after the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement, it is tragic that
    every day more black citizens lose&nbsp; their voting rights,&quot; said Marc Mauer,
    report co-author and assistant director of The Sentencing Project, based in Washington.
    &nbsp; &quot;This is not just a criminal justice issue, but one of basic democracy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nationwide, a total of 1.4 million black men-thirteen percent of all black men-cannot vote
    either because they are permanently disenfranchised ex-offenders, or because they are
    convicted felons currently in prison, on probation or on parole.&nbsp; The number of
    disenfranchised adults of all races is 3.9 million, three-quarters of whom are not in
    prison but are on probation or parole or have completed their sentences.<br>
    <br>
    The report, &quot;Losing the Vote: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the
    United States,&quot; is the first-ever state-by-state analysis of the impact of felony
    disenfranchisement laws.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The rate of disenfranchisement has grown higher in recent years as a result of harsh drug
    laws and mandatory sentencing requirements, which have sharply increased the number of
    offenders behind bars. <br>
    <br>
    Disenfranchised ex-offenders can seek a gubernatorial pardon to restore their voting
    rights, but few have the information or resources needed to do so.&nbsp; In Virginia, for
    example, there are more than 200,000 ex-offenders, but in 1996 and 1997, only 404 regained
    their voting rights. <br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project call for an end to permanent
    disenfranchisement.&nbsp; They also urge Congress and state legislatures to ensure
    citizens convicted of a felony retain their ability to vote unless disenfranchisement is
    part of a court-imposed sentence for specified serious crimes.&nbsp; In addition, the two
    organizations urge the United Nations Human Rights Committee to address U.S. criminal
    disenfranchisement laws in light of international human rights treaties prohibiting
    unreasonable or racially discriminatory restrictions on the right to vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Losing the Vote: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United
    States&quot; is available from Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project and will also
    be available, after October 22 at 14:00 E.S.T., at<br>

    Losing the Vote: Summary<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Losing the Vote:&nbsp; The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States
    provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of state laws that disqualify current and
    former felony offenders from voting.&nbsp; The report includes the following statistical
    highlights:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    46 states and the District of Columbia prohibit inmates from voting while serving a felony
    sentence.&nbsp; Four states-Maine, Massachusetts, Utah, and Vermont-permit inmates to
    vote.<br>
    <br>
    32 states prohibit felons from voting while they are on parole and 29 of these states
    exclude felony probationers also.<br>
    <br>
    10 states disenfranchise all ex-offenders who have completed their criminal sentence.
    &nbsp; Four others disenfranchise some ex-offenders.&nbsp; In addition, Texas
    disenfranchises ex-offenders for two years after they have completed their sentences.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    An estimated 3.9 million Americans, or one in fifty adults, have currently or permanently
    lost their voting rights as a result of a felony conviction.<br>
    <br>
    1.4 million persons disenfranchised are ex-offenders who have completed their sentences.<br>
    <br>
    1.4 million African American men, or 13% of black men, are disenfranchised, a rate seven
    times the national average.<br>
    <br>
    In seven states that deny the vote to ex-offenders, one in four black men is permanently
    disenfranchised.<br>
    <br>
    Given current rates of incarceration, three in ten of the next generation of black men can
    expect to be disenfranchised at some point in their lifetime.&nbsp; In states that
    disenfranchise ex-offenders, as many as 40% of the black men may permanently lose their
    right to vote.<br>
    <br>
    The scale of felony voting disenfranchisement in the U.S. is far greater than in any other
    nation and has serious implications for democratic processes and racial inclusion.
    &nbsp; The impact of these laws has been exacerbated by a quarter century of &quot;tough
    on crime&quot; criminal justice policies that have led to more people going to prison for
    longer periods of time.&nbsp; Policymakers at the state and federal level should
    reconsider these policies in light of legitimate correctional objectives and the
    democratic interests served by recognizing the right to vote of all sectors of the
    population.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Fact Sheet: States That Bar Ex-Offenders from Voting<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Alabama has disenfranchised 241,000 people, more than 40 percent of whom (105,000) are
    black men.&nbsp; Nearly one out of three black men in the state has lost the right to vote
    (31.5 percent).&nbsp; The right to vote can only be restored by a pardon from the
    governor.&nbsp; In 1996 and 1997, only 359 people were able to regain the ability to vote.
    <br>
    <br>
    Arizona has disenfranchised 74,600 adults, or 2.3 percent of the adult population. But the
    rate is five times higher for black men, of whom 12.1 percent have lost the right to vote.
    First offenders have their right to vote restored automatically after they complete their
    sentence. Offenders who have been convicted of more than one offense can only get the
    right to vote back by waiting at least two years after release from prison and
    &nbsp; applying to the court or by obtaining a pardon from the governor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Delaware has disenfranchised more than 20,000 people, or 3.7 percent of the population. Of
    those, 8,700 are black men. One in five adult black men cannot vote in the state of
    Delaware. The only way they can regain their voting rights is to obtain a pardon from the
    governor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Florida has disenfranchised more people than any other state in the country - 647,100
    people.&nbsp; This constitutes a rate of 5.9 percent of the adult population, which is
    three times the national average. Florida also has taken the vote away from more black men
    than any other state in the country - 204,600 people. Nearly one-third of all the
    disenfranchised people in the state are black men.&nbsp; More than two-thirds of these
    disenfranchised people have already served their time and been released from prison, or
    finished their probation or parole.&nbsp; If they want their voting rights back, they need
    to obtain a gubernatorial order restoring their civil rights, or they must obtain a
    pardon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Iowa has disenfranchised more than one in four black men, or 26.5 percent. In total,
    42,300 adults have been disenfranchised, and 60 percent of them are not in prison. Only
    the governor can restore their voting rights.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Kentucky has disenfranchised 0.8 percent of the adult population, including 7.7 percent of
    the state's black men, because they are currently under correctional supervision.
    &nbsp; The state also disenfranchises ex-offenders, but those figures are not available.
    Of the disenfranchised people in the state, 29 percent are black men. Only the governor
    can restore the right to vote. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Maryland is one of four states in which black men comprise more than half of all
    disenfranchised people. Of the total adult black male population in Maryland, 15.4 percent
    cannot vote, or 67,900 people. Of the total adult population, 3.6 percent have lost the
    vote, which is double the national average. First offenders regain the right to vote
    automatically, but second offenders do not. They need a pardon from the governor. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Mississippi has disenfranchised 145,600 people.&nbsp; More than half of the
    disenfranchised (81,700) are black men, representing 28.6 percent of the black men in the
    state. Convicted felons can regain the right to vote through a pardon or executive order
    of the governor, or if the state legislature passes a bill, and the governor signs it,
    restoring their voting rights.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Nevada has disenfranchised 10 percent of the black men in the state, or 4,000 people,
    because they are currently under correctional supervision.&nbsp; The state also
    disenfranchises ex-offenders, but those figures are not available. One out of four of the
    currently disenfranchised people in the state are black men. They can regain the vote
    through various administrative procedures, or by a pardon from the governor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    New Mexico has disenfranchised one out of four black men. Four percent of the adult
    population has lost the right to vote, or 48,900 people. Of these, 38,000 have completed
    their sentences, or nearly 80 percent. Convicted felons can only regain the vote if they
    obtain a pardon or restoration of rights from the governor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Tennessee has disenfranchised 97,800 people, or 2.4 percent of the adult population. More
    than half of these are people who have already served their time and been released. Nearly
    two-fifths of them are black men (39 percent), and 14.5 percent of all black men in the
    state cannot vote.&nbsp; People who were convicted before 1986 can only get their voting
    rights back by petitioning the court, while most of those convicted after 1986 get their
    rights back automatically. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    Virginia has disenfranchised 269,800 adults, or 5.3 percent of the total population, which
    is more than twice the national average. Eighty percent of those people have already
    completed their sentences. More than forty percent of them are black men. One out of four
    black men in Virginia cannot vote, or 110,000 people. Convicted felons may apply to the
    governor to restore their voting rights five years after they've completed their
    sentences. In 1996 and 1997, a total of 404 ex-offenders had their voting rights restored.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Washington has disenfranchised 16,700 black men, or one out of four black men in the
    state. Ex-offenders convicted prior to July 1, 1984 remain disenfranchised unless they
    receive a pardon. After 1984, convicted felons lose the vote while in prison, on
    probation, or on parole.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Wyoming&nbsp; has disenfranchised 4 percent of the state's adults --14,100 people
    &nbsp; --which is a rate twice the national average.&nbsp; More than&nbsp; one in four
    black men (27.7 percent) in Wyoming is barred from voting. Three-quarters of the state's
    disenfranchised adults are ex-offenders who have completed their criminal sentences. The
    right to vote can only be restored by the governor.<br>
    ********<br>
    Texas is not one of the fourteen states that permanently disenfranchises ex-offenders. But
    it does bar ex-offenders from voting for two years following completion of their sentence.
    Texas has the second highest number of disenfranchised people in the country: 610,000
    adults, or 4.5 percent of&nbsp; its adult population,&nbsp; twice the national average.
    One quarter of those people are black. Twenty percent of the black men in the state cannot
    vote.</font></td>
