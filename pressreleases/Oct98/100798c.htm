    October 7 - </font>The following was released today by Clean Air Trust:<p><br>
    As you may know, on November 5 the state of California is likely to approve a far-reaching
    plan to crack down on pollution from motor vehicles.</p>
    <p>A key component of the plan would require that nearly all sport utility vehicles,
    minivans and other &quot;light trucks&quot; meet the same tailpipe standards as passenger
    cars. (Right now they don't.)</p>
    <p>The car companies are bitterly resisting this cleanup proposal --presumably because the
    companies make big profits on these vehicles.(If they had to clean up, the companies might
    have to give up some of that profit margin, or raise prices slightly.) The California Air
    Resources Board reports the auto industry is making a bigger stink over cleaning up SUVs
    than it is over a plan to require much stricter tailpipe standards for passenger cars.</p>
    <p>We expect the California decision to be a prelude to an even bigger battle over
    national standards for motor vehicles. By late this year, the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency is expected to propose stricter motor vehicle standards, starting in
    2004. Once again, the SUV/minivan/pickup issue is sure to be a flash point.</p>
    <p>The attached fact sheet summarizes the &quot;light truck&quot; issue. Thanks for your
    attention. And please don't hesitate to call 202-785-9625 with any questions.</p>

    <p>DIRTY DOUBLE STANDARD: POLLUTION FROM SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES AND OTHER &quot;LIGHT
    TRUCKS&quot;</p>
    <p>Most people don't know it, but popular vehicles such as the Chevy Suburban, Tahoe and
    Yukon are legally allowed to spew out three to five times as much smog-forming pollution
    as today's passenger cars.In effect, they have a license to pollute.</p>
    <p>Why such a double standard?</p>
    <p>It's because the government officially considers sport utility vehicles, minivans and
    pickup trucks to be &quot;light trucks.&quot; And &quot;light trucks&quot; are allowed to
    pollute much more because they were once used mostly on farms and construction sites.</p>
    <p>These weaker standards remain in place even though &quot;light trucks&quot;now account
    for nearly one of every two family vehicles sold -- and even though most of them are used
    simply for shopping and commuting. No wonder our air remains too dirty.</p>
    <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has noted that making &quot;light trucks&quot; meet
    the same tailpipe standards as passenger cars would bean extremely effective way to reduce
    smog caused by motor vehicles --in fact, as effective as cutting pollution from &quot;low-
    emission&quot; vehicles in half.</p>
    <p>The EPA may set tougher standards for light trucks as part of a plan to set new
    controls for passenger vehicles starting in model year 2004. But the car companies are
    fighting any effort to make them clean up their act. (By the way, they also keep making
    bigger and bigger vehicles in part to evade pollution controls.)</p>
    <p>It doesn't have to be this way. These bigger vehicles pollute more because the car
    companies simply use cheaper and less effective pollution control devices.</p>
    <p>The American public expects EPA to protect public health. This means requiring the car
    companies to make SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks as clean as passenger cars. It's time
    to end this dirty double standard.</p>
    <p>The vehicle pollution standards are complex, but essentially the heavier the vehicle,
    the more it's allowed to pollute. A big Suburban, for example, can emit nearly three times
    as much nitrogenoxides (a main cause of smog), 56 percent more hydrocarbons(including
    cancer-causing chemicals) and 47 percent more carbon monoxide (which can cause heart
    problems) than even the heaviest passenger cars.</p>
    <p>Even most lightweight sport utility vehicles are dirtier than automobiles. For example,
    a lightweight SUV can legally emit 75 percent more nitrogen oxides than a big passenger
    car. These SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks probably will pollute more even if the car
    companies brand them as &quot;low-emission&quot; vehicles.</p>
