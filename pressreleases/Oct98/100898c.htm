    October 8 - A report released today by U.S Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) and the
    Clean Air Network documented more than 5200 violations of the new federal health standard
    for ozone pollution or &#147;smog&#148; this summer.&nbsp; The report, <b>&#147;Smog
    Threat &#145;98&#148;</b> found that on more than three out of every four days this
    summer, unhealthy levels of air pollution were recorded in the United States.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;Americans should be outraged that, all too often, their air is unsafe to breathe.
    &nbsp; This report is a wake-up call to take immediate action to clean up old power plants
    and cars,&#148; said Rebecca Stanfield, Energy Advocate for U.S. PIRG.<br>
    <br>
    The report compiled and analyzed air quality data recorded between April and early
    September for twenty-six states and Washington, DC, where such information is readily
    available to the public.&nbsp; More limited data from an additional fifteen states is also
    included, while nine states failed to provide sufficient air quality data to be included.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;Clearly, air pollution is a nationwide problem affecting millions of Americans,&#148;
    said Jayne Mardock, Director of the Clean Air Network.&nbsp; &#147;We have a duty to solve
    this problem to protect ourselves and our children&#146;s health.&#148; Among the report&#146;s
    findings are:<br>
    <br>
    ·At least 5208 violations of the new health-based smog standard occurred between
    &nbsp; April 5 and September 14 of this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    ·Although data is not available for every site for this time period, the smog standard
    was violated somewhere in the United States on 126 out of 163 days, or 77% of the days
    between April 5 and September 14.<br>
    <br>
    ·Among the 26 states and Washington, DC where data is available from early April through
    early September, the new standard was violated this year 19 times more frequently (3847
    times) than the old standard (200 times). <br>
    <br>
    ·Among the same states, there were 27% more violations of the new smog standard reported
    in 1998 (3847) than were reported in 1997 (3026).&nbsp; </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">·California has had more known violations of the new eight-hour smog standard
    than any other state this year, with 1025 violations. The following&nbsp; &#147;dirty
    dozen&#148; states had the highest number of unhealthy smog days: CA, NC, TX, GA, PA, NJ,
    MD, NY, IN, OH, VA, FL (see attached chart.)<br>
    <br>
    &quot;More than six million people with asthma live in areas projected to exceed the new
    smog standard,&quot;&nbsp; said Dr. Alfred Munzer, Director of Pulmonary Medicine at the
    Washington Adventist Hospital, and past President of the American Lung Association.
    &nbsp; &#147;For asthma patients, a smoggy summer means missed work, staying indoors
    instead of playing outside, and in too many cases, spending the day at the emergency room
    instead of at summer camp.&nbsp; This report demonstrates that we need action to protect
    those most vulnerable to air pollution,&quot; he continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In 1997 the EPA adopted a new, tighter smog standard based on an overwhelming body of
    medical evidence showing that the old standard was too weak to protect people from health
    impacts of breathing smog.&nbsp; Under the new standard, the air is considered dangerously
    polluted when smog concentrations reach .085 parts per million over an eight-hour period. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;It is not enough to have tough health standards,&#148; said Stanfield.&nbsp; &#147;People
    will continue to become sick and die prematurely from air pollution until the standards
    are met, and this means polluters need to start cutting their emissions immediately,&#148;
    continued Stanfield.<br>
    <br>
    The groups called on Congress and EPA to take action to reduce smog from two of its
    primary sources:&nbsp; the electric power industry, and motor vehicles. Each of these
    sources emit approximately one-third of the smog-forming nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution
    emitted in the U.S. each year.&nbsp; In September, the EPA took a major step toward
    cleaner air when it adopted a new rule requiring summertime cuts in pollution from power
    plants in 22 eastern states and Washington, DC.&nbsp; That rule will reduce summertime NOx
    pollution by 1.1 million tons over the next five years.&nbsp; However, the rule does not
    reach most states, does not require year-round reductions in NOx, and does not require
    cuts in the three other major power plant pollutants: sulfur; mercury; and carbon dioxide.
    &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &#147;Congress should expand upon EPA&#146;s new rule by mandating year-round reductions
    in the four major air pollutants from power plants across the nation and eliminating the
    &#147;lethal loophole&#148; in the Clean Air Act that exempts old dirty power plants from
    emissions standards,&#148; said Stanfield.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The other major source of smog-forming air pollution is motor vehicles.&nbsp; By the end
    of this year, EPA will propose new standards for automobile emissions from cars, trucks
    and sport-utility vehicles made in the year 2004 and beyond.&nbsp; Driven by tougher
    standards in California, auto makers have developed cars that have zero or near-zero
    emissions.&nbsp; Moreover, low-sulfur gasoline is available, which, if sold nationwide,
    would cut smog-forming NOx pollution from motor vehicles dramatically.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;EPA must continue taking aggressive steps to clean the air, starting with adopting
    nationwide clean car, truck and sport-utility vehicle emission standards that match the
    tough California clean car program,&quot; said Mardock.&nbsp; &quot;The technology exists
    for a new generation of low and non-polluting cars, and the public health need is
    indisputable,&quot; she continued. <br>
