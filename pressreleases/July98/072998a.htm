    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 29 - Despite headlines this week reporting that 66 of
    77 Oklahoma counties have been declared a national disaster area, a key glacier in the
    Arctic is melting by as much as a three-quarters of a mile a year and the heat-related
    death toll has reached 144, the GOP-led Congress continues to host witnesses who deny the
    relentlessly forthcoming evidence that global temperatures are on the rise. <br>
    <br>
    The original list of invited witness pulled together by Chairman Jim Talent (R-MO) for
    today's House Committee on Small Business hearing entitled &quot;Global Warming &#150;
    Does it Make Sense&quot; only included scientists whose credentials or credibility have
    been endlessly drawn into question. Dr. Bob Watson who chairs the Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change and Dan Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council have since been
    invited to testify at the hearing. Still, the majority of witnesses are global warming
    skeptics, including:<br>
    <br>
    ..........<br>
    Dr. Patrick Michaelsof the Cato Institute, a vocal skeptic who opposes action on global
    warming, receives funding from a number of corporate interests who share his views. Among
    them are the Edison Electric Institute, the German Coal Mining Association and the Western
    Fuels Association. <br>
    <br>
    ..........<br>
    Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama is a leading proponent of the &quot;global
    cooling&quot; theory. His inaccurate read of satellite data has been disputed by research
    from the National Center for Atmospheric Research that shows surface area data pointing to
    rising global temperatures. <br>
    <br>
    ..........<br>
    Dr. Fred Singer of the Science and Environmental Policy Report is often cited by skeptics
    as the lead voice on how global warming is a myth despite not having published original
    peer-reviewed research on global warming in over two decades. <br>
    <br>
    ..........<br>
    Dr. Marlo Lewis represents the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a pro-industry think tank
    funded by the American Petroleum Institute, Dow Chemical, General Motors and Texaco (to
    name a few). <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is a travesty that we are faced with another hearing featuring to GOP's 'tried
    and true experts' who will predictably urge us to ignore the evidence that global warming
    is upon us,&quot; said John Passacantando, Executive Director of Ozone Action. <br>
    <br>
    This weekend President Clinton released $100 million in emergency funds to the 11 hottest
    states. In his Saturday radio address he said, &quot;We are facing squarely the problem of
    global warming -- but there are still some in Congress who would rather pretend it doesn't
    exist.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Passacantando added, &quot;with the extreme weather of 1998 breaking records every day, we
    need to begin discussing how we move from short term relief plans for disaster-impacted
    areas like Texas, Oklahoma and Florida, toward a longer term plan for reducing emissions
    of<br>
    greenhouse gases.&quot;<p align="center">###</td>
