    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - July 2 - Human Rights Watch welcomes the&nbsp; announcement
    by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Nigerian head of state has agreed
    to release all political prisoners.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &quot;This is an important step in confidence-building,&quot; said Peter
    &nbsp; Takirambudde, &quot;but a great deal more remains to be done before Nigeria should
    be welcomed back to the international fold.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Takirambudde said the U.N. and other international bodies should monitor prisoner releases
    closely. &quot;General Abdulsalam Abubakar should also announce an early date for the
    military to leave office,&quot; said Takirambudde, &quot;and ensure that a genuinely
    elected government is installed in Nigeria at the earliest date.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Human Rights Watch has called for the international community to establish a set of clear
    benchmarks for Nigeria to respect before sanctions adopted by the European Union, United
    States, Commonwealth and others should be lifted.&nbsp; These include not only the release
    of political prisoners, but also the repeal of certain key repressive decrees, respect for
    freedom of the media, and, most importantly, the holding of genuinely free and fair
    elections.&nbsp; These benchmarks are even more important now that the Nigerian government
    is showing signs of sensitivity to international opinion.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Human Rights Watch also cautioned that the release of political prisoners should be
    carefully monitored to ensure that all known prisoners are indeed released.&nbsp; These
    would include not only Chief Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of the 1993 elections, but
    also twenty Ogoni activists held in prison since 1994 in connection with the same charges
    as those for which Ken Saro-Wiwa and his codefendants were hanged; several journalists,
    including Moshood Fayewmiwo, Adetokunbo Fakeye, Rafiu Salau, Babafemi Ojudu, George Mbah,
    Ben Charles Obi, and Kunle Ajibade; and a Muslim leader Sheikh El Zak Zaky and others
    charged with sedition.&nbsp; Several tens of military officers convicted of involvement in
    alleged coup plots in 1995 and 1997 also remain in prison.&nbsp; In addition, there are
    large numbers of less well-known political prisoners, including household members or
    associates of the better known detainees, whose release must be ensured.<p align="center">###<br>
