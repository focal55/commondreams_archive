    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 30 - The following was released today by Physicians
    for Social Responsibility:<br>
    <br>
    President Clinton today officially designated the Hudson River an American Heritage River.
    But with 200 miles of the river bottom coated with toxic PCBs, the Hudson is also the
    country's largest Superfund site.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This river, which is so important to the history and culture of New York state, is
    also making people sick,&quot; said Cathy Falvo, M.D., a pediatrician and president the
    New York City chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR). &quot;Despite the
    claims of General Electric's paid scientists, the Hudson is heavily contaminated with PCBs
    and they won't just go away.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    General Electric, which is responsible for dumping PCBs from a number of facilities into
    the Hudson, has stubbornly refused to admit that these pollutants pose a health threat.
    However, studies show that exposure to PCBs, primarily through contaminated fish and other
    foods, can adversely affect intellectual function, short-term memory and behavior. PCBs
    are also suspected to cause cancer.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;PCBs are known neurotoxins capable of damaging the brain development of
    children,&quot; said Philip Landrigan, M.D., director of environmental and occupational
    medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a PSR board member. &quot;They cross the
    placenta and accumulate in breast milk, exposing the fetus and nursing infant at a
    vulnerable time. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation has advised women
    to consume no fish from the Hudson during their entire pregnancy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Just last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released new findings that PCBs
    in Hudson River sediments are leaching back into the water. GE has been fighting the
    agency over its order to dredge the river to remove the PCBs. If PCBs are moving out of
    sediments and into the river, they are likely to volatilize into the air at the surface.
    They can be carried by wind thousands of miles, posing a widespread health risk.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is a serious local problem, but it is also an international issue,&quot; said
    Gene Fisher, a member of the Hudson Valley Sustainable Communities Network. &quot;We need
    to get the PCBs cleaned up from our river, but we also need strong international action to
    eliminate PCBs and similar chemicals globally.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A global treaty to eliminate PCBs and 11 other persistent organic pollutants is currently
    being negotiated. Although the manufacture of new PCBs has already been banned in the
    United States and most other countries, it is estimated that 35 percent of all PCBs ever
    produced has been released to the environment and some 60 percent is still in service in
    electrical components or in landfills, creating potential problems.<br>
