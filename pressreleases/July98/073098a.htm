    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 30 - The Republican Party is resorting to a series of
    political ploys in a vain effort to make ballistic missile defense a key political issue
    in the 1998 election campaign.<br>
    <br>
    These gimmicks include forcing highly-political votes on the Senate floor,
    &quot;cooking&quot; opinion polling results and threatening media barrages in key states
    where Senators are not buying their snake oil medicine.<br>
    <br>
    However, advocates of an immediate missile deployment have one overwhelming handicap:
    there is no there there. After more than 40 years of work and spending more than $108
    billion -- including more than $59 billion since 1983 (source: Atomic Audit: The Costs and
    Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons since 1940 (Brookings Institution Press) -- the
    Pentagon has not be able to produce a missile defense that works consistently and
    effectively against medium- and long-range missiles.&nbsp; For example, the Army's
    high-priority THAAD theater missile defense system has failed five out of five tests, most
    recently in May.<br>
    <br>
    These flops have not stopped Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson from
    writing in the June 21, Washington Times that if Democrats are not prepared to join
    Republicans in supporting NMD, &quot;The Republican Party is prepared to have this become
    a political issue.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Two years ago, Republicans, including Bob Dole, similarly tried to make ballistic missile
    defense an issue, and failed miserably. The public was simply not interested.<br>
    <br>
    Nor have these flops stopped Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran from offering a blatantly
    political motion on May 13 to bring up his measure requiring deployment of a National
    Missile Defense &quot;as soon as technologically possible&quot; when the U.S. is years --
    if not decades -- away from such a point.&nbsp; Although Cochran's motion to begin a
    debate failed by one vote (59 - 41), he may bring up his motion a second time.<br>
    <br>
    Desperate to show support for missile defenses, the Republican National Committee released
    a &quot;cooked poll&quot; with a question designed to produce the answer they wanted. On
    July 16, the RNC put out results showing over 75% of voters favor missile defense.
    &nbsp; To produce the desired answer, the RNC stacked the deck by including introductory
    scare material about 13 Chinese missiles targeted at the west coast of the U.S. and
    assumed that there exists an &quot;effective&quot; missile defense system to deploy.
    &nbsp; Specifically, the poll asked: <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Recent reports say the Chinese have 13 long range missiles targeted at the west
    coast of America. Knowing this, would you favor or oppose an effective National Missile
    Defense system capable of defending US territory against limited ballistic attack?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    More credible polling, conducted in five states by Democratic pollster Mark Mellman and
    Republican pollster Richard Wirthlin, found the public in each of the states
    overwhelmingly reject spending more on missile defense as a result of the South Asian
    nuclear tests. The question asked on June 26 was whether residents of&nbsp; Kansas,
    Nebraska, Tennessee, Oregon and Utah would favor or oppose a proposal&nbsp; to
    &quot;increase the amount of money we are spending to develop and deploy nuclear missile
    defenses for the United States.&quot; The lowest level of opposition was 55% against in
    Tennessee and the largest 73% against in Oregon. <br>
    <br>
    Kansas: 31% support, 61% oppose<br>
    Nebraska: 32% support, 62% oppose<br>
    Oregon: 23% support, 73% oppose<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tennessee:
    39% support, 55% oppose<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utah:
    30% support, 64% oppose<br>
    <br>
    Many Republicans such as Majority Leader Trent Lott have argued for missile defense rather
    than the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as a response to South Asian nuclear tests.
    &nbsp; Specifically, Trent Lott put out a press release on May 29 which stated: &quot;Only
    effective missile defenses, not unenforceable arms control treaties, will break the
    offensive arms race in Asia and provide incentives to address security concerns without a
    nuclear response.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A September 1997 national poll also conducted by The Mellman Group confirmed the public
    split on whether or not to build a national missile defense: 42% favor such a defense, 39%
    oppose, with 19% undecided.&nbsp; The question:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Supporters of building a U.S. ballistic missile defense system say that right now
    the U.S. has no defense against ballistic nuclear missiles fired from other countries and
    that this law [a Republican bill to mandate deployment by 2003] will require the Defense
    Department to develop cost effective means of shooting down incoming nuclear missiles.
    &nbsp; Opponents of building a U.S. ballistic missile defense system say that we have been
    unable to create such a national missile defense even after having already spent 99
    billion dollars to do so.&nbsp; It makes no sense to spend more money for this purpose
    when the real threat comes from terrorists, not from ballistic nuclear missiles fired at
    the U.S. from other countries.&nbsp; Do you favor or oppose building a national ballistic
    missile defense system?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Lastly, The Wall Street Journal reported that Empower America is planning to run
    pro-missile defense radio ads in Nevada to pressure the two Democratic Senators there to
    support a National Missile Defense.<br>
    <br>
    John Isaacs, Council for a Livable World President, concluded: &quot;Let the Republican
    games on missile defense continue.&nbsp; If they try once more to make a National Missile
    Defense an issue in the fall campaign, they will fail miserably once again.&quot;<p align="center"># # #</td>
