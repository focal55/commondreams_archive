    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 1 - Long-standing environmental protections provided
    by state and federal laws would be canceled for an entire region of the country if the
    Senate passes the unprecedented &quot;dams without laws&quot; rider to the Interior
    Appropriations bill.<br>
    <br>
    Offered by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), the rider would block important river restoration,
    water quality and salmon recovery efforts by federal or state agencies for the Columbia
    River watershed in order to protect the interests of the electric power, navigation, and
    agricultural industries.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This proposal is breathtaking in its audacity,&quot; stated Rebecca Wodder,
    president of American Rivers. &quot;Sen. Gorton has launched an unprecedented attack on
    both the nation's environmental laws and the fish and wildlife resources of the Northwest.
    He knows that Congress would never pass a free standing bill with this language and so is
    using the Interior Appropriations bill as a vehicle to move it through the process. We
    urge the Senate to reject Sen. Gorton's rider.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The anti-river rider is intended to block restoration efforts for fish and wildlife by
    requiring Congressional approval for any activity by any federal or state agency that
    would change the operations of dams in the Columbia River watershed. These changes include<br>
    <br>
    reducing the generation of power from power dams; <br>
    reducing the flood control capacity of dams; <br>
    reducing reservoir levels below minimum irrigation pools. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sen. Gorton's proposal would drastically undercut the authority of federal and state
    agencies to protect fish, wildlife and water quality,&quot; added Wodder. &quot;If the
    Senate passes this environmentally devastating rider, it could be signing the death
    warrant for salmon and steelhead runs throughout the Northwest.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sen. Gorton has also added language to the Interior Appropriations bill that would
    undermine years of effort by federal, state, tribal and private interests to remove two
    salmon-killing dams on Olympic National Park's Elwha River. These dams continue to damage
    one of the Northwest's legendary salmon rivers.<br>
    <br>
    The Senate is expected to begin consideration of the Interior Appropriations bill as soon
    as July 8th.<br>
    <br>
    American Rivers' objections to the Gorton provisions were contained in a July 1 letter to
    the U.S. Senate and Clinton Administration released today. American Rivers is the nation's
    leading river conservation organization.<p align="center">###<br>
