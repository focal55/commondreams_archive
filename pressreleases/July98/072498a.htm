    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">PHNOM PENH - July 24 - On the last day of campaigning before the 26 July
    elections in Cambodia, Amnesty International representatives in the country today
    condemned the ongoing violence and intimidation. <br>
    <br>
    Operating in a climate of institutionalized impunity, members of the security forces
    controlled by the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) are able to commit human rights
    violations without fear of being brought to justice. Lack of concrete action by the state
    is compounded by near silence from the international community on cases of concern, thus
    perpetuating the cycle of violence, the representatives said. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The human rights situation in Cambodia has become so twisted that victims are blamed
    for their suffering, and investigators are condemned for their efforts to protect the
    victims,&quot; an Amnesty International spokesperson said. &quot;Much of the international
    community plays down the level of violence, sanitises the trauma of victims and ignores
    the impact of human rights violations on freedom of association and expression.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Activists have been intimidated, politicians have been threatened, party agents have
    been shot and killed, and prisoners have been illegally arrested and badly beaten by
    policemen while held in detention.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The majority of the victims are associated with the two major opposition parties,
    FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party. <br>
    <br>
    On 22 July, Amnesty International delegates located Danh Teav, a FUNCINPEC Ministry of
    Interior employee who had been arrested without a warrant in the evening of 20 July and
    held in incommunicado detention by the Phnom Penh Criminal Police. He was severely beaten
    in an attempt to compel him to &quot;confess&quot; to involvement in the attempted murder
    of a pro-government newspaper editor earlier this year and other crimes. <br>
    <br>
    When the delegates saw him, he was unable to stand without help, had bruises and abrasions
    on his back and chest, and cuts around the wrists where he had been shackled. Danh Teav's
    wife is an election candidate for the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and was detained for two
    hours with her husband. <br>
    <br>
    The delegates also found five other men, all shackled together with Danh Teav, at least
    three of whom had been badly beaten in police custody. The clothes of two of the men were
    covered in blood, and both had cuts and swelling on their faces. They were frightened of
    being taken back to the police station to face further beatings. None of the six had been
    allowed access to lawyers, doctors or family members while in police custody. <br>
    <br>
    The Amnesty International team also interviewed a FUNCINPEC party activist who had been
    shot in the leg, following months of harassment from the local CPP authorities since the
    July 1997 violent ousting from power of FUNCINPEC First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
    Ranariddh. The authorities claim that he shot himself as &quot;an attention-seeking
    gesture&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Repeated and measured attempts by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
    Human Rights to draw the government's attention to the human rights situation in the
    country have been met with violence and threats. In April a staff member was assaulted,
    and the government has since made clear its intention to expel UN personnel blamed for
    bringing human rights violations to light. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The international community cannot turn a blind eye to the widespread intimidation
    in Cambodia,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;Foreign government officials in Phnom Penh
    and election monitors in the country must speak out about each and every incidence of
    political violence and intimidation. It is then up to the Cambodian authorities to ensure
    that all of Cambodia's voters can go to the polls on Sunday without fear.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    BACKGROUND <br>
    <br>
    The human rights climate in Cambodia has deteriorated sharply following a grenade attack
    on a peaceful opposition demonstration organized by Sam Rainsy in March 1997. At least 16
    people died and over 100 were injured. No serious investigations into the incident have
    been undertaken by the government authorities. <br>
    <br>
    Scores of people were extrajudicially executed during a coup in July last year in which
    FUNCINPEC First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh was ousted from power. Most of the
    victims were high-ranking FUNCINPEC military and security personnel. No one has been
    brought to justice for any of these killings, although in a blatantly unfair trial the
    Phnom Penh Military court imposed a post-mortem sentence of 20 years' imprisonment on one
    of those killed. <br>
    <br>
    In the immediate aftermath of the coup, thousands of opposition politicians and
    supporters, mainly from FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party, fled the country. Although
    political party activists later returned to participate in the election, thousands of
    FUNCINPEC officers and troops remain on the Cambodian-Thai border, and dozens of FUNCINPEC
    security personnel who remained in the country have been killed over the past year. <p align="center">###</td>
