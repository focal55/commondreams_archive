    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 30 - Today Clean Air advocates released a new report
    documenting that for the first half of the 1998 ozone season, air pollution reached levels
    considered unhealthful under the federal standard for smog on at least 74 days, or on
    seven out of every ten days.&nbsp; Violations of the standard occurred 1904 times at
    monitors across the nation.&nbsp; The report is called &quot;Danger in the Air:&nbsp; A
    Midpoint Assessment of the 1998 Ozone Season,&quot; and was co-written by the&nbsp; U.S.
    Public Interest Research Group Education Fund and the Clean Air Network. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;This summer, people in the U.S. have been routinely breathing air that is dangerous
    to their health,&quot;&nbsp; said Rebecca Stanfield, Staff Attorney for the U.S. Public
    Interest Research Group.&nbsp; &quot;Frequent exposure to high levels of smog will cause
    significant loss of lung function even for perfectly healthy adults, and is much more
    threatening for children, the elderly and those with asthma or respiratory disease,&quot;
    she continued.<br>
    <br>
    This summer is the first year that states have been required to monitor and report
    violations of EPA&#146;s new standard for smog, adopted last year in response to
    overwhelming evidence that the old standard was not protecting public health.&nbsp; Not
    all states have made this data available yet, but the data that is available from 27
    states and Washington, DC indicate that:<br>
    <br>
     The new standard is significantly more protective than the old standard. While the new
    standard was violated 1904 times on 74 days, the old standard was violated 139 times on 35
    days.<br>
    <br>
     On every day since June 20, at least one U.S. community has been exposed to unhealthful
    levels of air pollution;<br>
    <br>
     North Carolina is experiencing the most frequent exposure to dangerously high air
    pollution levels, violating the standard on more than half the days since the start of
    ozone season;<br>
    <br>
     Other states experiencing especially frequent episodes of unhealthful air quality
    include:&nbsp; Texas (34% of days);&nbsp; Georgia (46% of days); Florida (32% of days);
    Pennsylvania (38% of days);&nbsp; Maryland (33% of days); Indiana (28% of days); New
    Jersey (27% of days); New York (25% of days) and Michigan (22% of days).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Aggressive action is needed to protect public health from the impacts of air
    pollution,&quot; said Stanfield.&nbsp; &quot;We greatly appreciate EPA&#146;s leadership
    in setting tough new standards for clean air.&nbsp; Now we are counting upon EPA and
    Congress both to cut emissions of smog-forming pollution from power plants and from cars,
    to ensure that these standards are met,&quot;&nbsp; she added.<br>
    <br>
    Right now the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is reviewing a new rule proposed by
    EPA to cut smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 22 eastern states
    85% by the year 2003.&nbsp; Electric power plants are the largest industrial source of
    this pollutant, emitting about one-third of U.S NOx emissions.&nbsp; The rule would
    significantly reduce the number of violations of both the old and new smog standards in
    many of the same southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic states where the air has been
    unhealthy most frequently this summer.&nbsp; This rule is under attack from a coalition of
    coal and utility companies from the midwest and the south.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Once again, EPA is in the position of needing to stand up to the polluting
    industries in order to protect public health,&quot;&nbsp; said Stanfield. &quot;We hope
    the Administration listens to the people who are breathing the air on this issue, and not
    the industries who cause the pollution,&quot;&nbsp; she concluded.<p align="center">###</td>
