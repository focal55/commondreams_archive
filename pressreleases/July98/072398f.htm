    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 23 - The House today voted to override President
    Clinton's veto of the so-called &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion ban. President Clinton
    vetoed the ban last year on the grounds that the bill did not include an exemption to
    protect the health of the woman. Today the House overrode that veto on a vote of 296-132.
    The Senate is expected to attempt an override vote in the fall.<br>
    <br>
    NARAL President Kate Michelman said the House's action amounts to election-year pandering.
    &quot;Backers of this measure know full well that this law, as it is currently written, is
    patently unconstitutional. This vote is a blatant attempt to appease their increasingly
    restless social conservative base during an election year,&quot; said Michelman. <br>
    <br>
    Twenty-eight states have enacted similar so-called &quot;partial-birth&quot; bans. Of the
    20 that have been challenged in court thus far, 18 have been enjoined in whole or in part
    as unconstitutional. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Proponents of these laws claim they are just trying to ban late-term abortions. But
    these laws actually have extraordinary scope and make no distinction as to when a
    so-called &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion takes place. Nor do they talk about
    trimesters or fetal viability as required by Roe v. Wade,&quot; said Michelman. &quot;So
    what exactly are they trying to ban? Backers of this measure have answered that question
    and the answer is all abortions, at any stage of pregnancy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The sensationalized debate over so-called &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortions
    overshadows this Congress' atrocious record on reproductive choice. Since abortion
    opponents took over Congress in 1995, they have voted 94 times to restrict choice, winning
    all but 13 of those votes,&quot; said Michelman. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;In recent weeks, we have seen anti-choice members of Congress vote to ban the
    testing and approval of RU-486, an effective, nonsurgical method of inducing early
    abortion that has been in use since 1981. We have seen them attempt to block insurance
    coverage of contraceptives for federal employees. We have even seen them attempt to
    classify some of the safest and most commonly used forms of birth control as
    'abortifacients.' Today's vote highlights the hypocrisy inherent in opposing abortion
    while simultaneously blocking efforts to make abortion less necessary,&quot; added
    Michelman. <p align="center">###</td>
