    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 2 - At the site of Washington's popular new memorial
    to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Vice President Al Gore joined the National
    Organization on Disability (N.O.D.) today to launch the &quot;Rendezvous with
    Destiny&quot; Campaign. The N.O.D.'s ambitious goal is to raise the funds needed to
    construct and place America's first and only statue of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in
    his wheelchair.<br>
    <br>
    The campaign was announced today at an event called and keynoted by Vice President Al Gore
    and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt. Representing N.O.D., which is leading the
    F.D.R. statue effort, were Campaign Co-Chairman Michael Deland (chairman, N.O.D.) and
    Christopher Roosevelt, a grandson of the late president. The campaign's honorary chairman
    is former President George Bush.<br>
    <br>
    As part of its commitment to officially complete the F.D.R. Memorial, N.O.D. has pledged
    to raise $1.5 million in funds to construct this unprecedented and historic new statue of
    President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his wheelchair. The campaign launch was marked by
    N.O.D.'s announcement of the first major gift of $100,000 from Gordon and Llura Gund. Mr.
    Gund is a successful business leader, who is blind and active in blindness prevention
    programs.<br>
    <br>
    Three years ago, N.O.D. initiated and spearheaded efforts to add a status of F.D.R. in a
    wheelchair to the memorial, which has been visited by more than 2 million people since its
    dedication in May 1997. Former Presidents Bush, Ford and Carter along with Roosevelt
    family members joined thousands in the disability community in support of the effort. In
    July 1997, President Clinton signed legislation mandating this important addition to the
    memorial.<br>
    <br>
    The campaign's theme echoes President Roosevelt's calling to his own generation of
    Americans to a &quot;rendezvous with destiny,&quot; inspiring all Americans to persevere
    through the Great Depression and win World War II. F.D.R. met his personal rendezvous with
    destiny beginning in 1921 when at age 39 he contracted polio; he never took another step
    unassisted. During his 12 years in the White House, he used a wheelchair every day.<br>
    <br>
    Michael Deland called on a new generation of Americans to fulfill yet another
    &quot;rendezvous with destiny,&quot; by completing the F.D.R. Memorial and adding a statue
    of F.D.R. in his wheelchair. &quot;Fifty years from now schoolchildren will go through the
    memorial and know that F.D.R. turned his disability into a source of strength, first for
    himself, then for all people,&quot; remarked Deland. He added, &quot;I am heartened by the
    vision to convey F.D.R.'s triumph over adversity as a symbol of what anyone, disabled or
    non-disabled can achieve.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In addition to raising funds, N.O.D. will continue to educate the public about F.D.R.'s
    leadership of the nation and the world from a wheelchair.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ignoring F.D.R.'s disability in the memorial missed a central part of my
    grandfather's identity,&quot; said Christopher Roosevelt, the former president's grandson.
    &quot;His battle with polio helped forge his leadership qualities of determination,
    compassion, patience and courage.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Alan A. Reich, president, N.O.D., stated, &quot;We commend Congress, President Clinton,
    Vice President Gore and Secretary Babbitt for their vision and leadership. We are grateful
    to the Roosevelt family for their spirited commitment. Most importantly, we thank the many
    thousands of people, with and without disabilities, all across America for their forceful
    and effective advocacy leading to tomorrow's victory celebration. This is democracy at its
    best!&quot;<br>
