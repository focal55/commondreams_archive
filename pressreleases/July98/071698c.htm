    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 16 - New polling data released today by the Campaign
    for Tobacco-Free Kids show the combination of accepting tobacco campaign contributions and
    opposition to a national tobacco control policy may be lethal for candidates in the fall
    elections. By nearly a 7-to-1 margin, voters are much more likely to vote for a candidate
    who refuses tobacco money and supports a national tobacco control policy than one who
    takes tobacco contributions and opposes such a policy. This trend is particularly strong
    among women voters, according to the survey.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This poll provides a clear view of the political liability candidates could face
    this fall over the tobacco issue,&quot; said Bill Novelli, Campaign president.
    &quot;Senators are now on record either standing with America's kids or standing with the
    tobacco industry. Those who opposed the national policy in the form of the McCain bill and
    also took significant tobacco money will face particularly intense voter reaction.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The survey shows continued strong support for a national tobacco control policy, with 75
    percent favoring and only 21 percent opposing when given basic information about what
    comprehensive legislation would include.<br>
    <br>
    The survey also shows that 39 percent of voters are more likely to vote for the candidate
    who supports the national policy, vs. only 17 percent who would vote for the candidate who
    opposes such a policy.<br>
    <br>
    When tobacco money is added to the equation, the impact on voting intention is even more
    dramatic. By a 40 percent margin (47 percent vs. 7 percent), voters are more likely to
    support the candidate who refuses tobacco money and supports a national tobacco control
    policy over the candidate who takes the money and opposes such a policy.<br>
    <br>
    What is most striking is the intensity of these views: nearly 30 percent of voters are
    much more likely to vote for the candidate refusing money and supporting tobacco control
    policy, while less than 5 percent were much more supportive of the pro-tobacco candidate.<br>
    <br>
    Last week, the CAMPAIGN released a scorecard detailing each Senator's votes on the McCain
    tobacco control legislation that was recently shelved by the full Senate, as well as
    tobacco PAC contributions each Senator has accepted over the last decade. The McCain bill
    contained similar provisions as those outlined in the Campaign voter survey. The bill was
    a comprehensive approach to tobacco control that would have imposed restrictions on youth
    access to tobacco, curtailed advertising that has the greatest influence on kids, created
    a national public education campaign, raised the price of cigarettes to discourage tobacco
    use among children, confirmed the authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco, and more. The
    McCain bill, or other tobacco legislation, could still be considered during the remainder
    of this congressional session.<br>
    <br>
    The scorecard showed a strong link between votes against the McCain bill and acceptance of
    tobacco campaign contributions. For the period of January 1, 1987 through the first
    quarter of 1998, the average tobacco contribution accepted by Senators opposing the McCain
    legislation was four times as much as was received by those who supported the bill:
    $34,083 compared to $8,108.<br>
    <br>
    Tobacco political action committee (PAC) contributions from January 1, 1987 through March
    31, 1998 total $2,033,579 to current U.S. Senators and $5,301,574 to current House
    Members.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The tobacco industry has bought a temporary victory in the Congress,&quot; said
    Novelli. &quot;But the American public is now saying that those who were influenced by
    political contributions and who successfully killed the bill may be in for a tough ride
    this November. There is still time this year for members of Congress to declare their
    independence from Big Tobacco and to work for comprehensive legislation that protects kids
    and saves lives.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The poll also shows a significant increase in support among female voters for those
    candidates who refuse tobacco money and support a national tobacco control policy. More
    than 52 percent of women voters would be more likely to vote for the candidate who refuses
    tobacco money and supports a tobacco control policy, compared to less than 7 percent who
    would support the candidate who takes tobacco money and opposes such a policy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Female voters are an important group for both political parties,&quot; continued
    Novelli. &quot;This poll shows that protecting kids from tobacco will be a critical issue
    for women in the upcoming elections.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The national survey of 835 registered voters was conducted July 6-8, 1998 by Market Facts'
    TeleNation. The full sample has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points.<br>

    TAKING TOBACCO MONEY AND VOTING AGAINST KIDS IMPERILS CANDIDATES FINDINGS FROM A NATIONAL
    SURVEY<br>
    <br>
    To assess the effect of taking tobacco industry campaign contributions and opposing
    national tobacco policy on a candidate's electoral prospects, the Campaign for
    Tobacco-Free Kids commissioned a national telephone survey of 835 registered voters from
    July 6-8, 1998. The results clearly show that the combination of taking tobacco money and
    opposing tobacco control legislation designed to protect kids may be a serious liability
    for Congressional candidates this fall.<br>
    --<br>
    Q1: As you may know, Congress and the President have been considering legislation to
    develop a national tobacco policy to reduce tobacco use among kids. Such a policy would
    include public education to discourage kids from smoking, help for smokers to quit,
    enforcement of laws to prevent tobacco sales to kids and increases in the price of tobacco
    products to discourage use by kids. There would also be strict limitations on tobacco
    advertising and marketing to kids, as well as authority for the Food and Drug
    Administration to regulate tobacco like it does other consumer products. Based on this
    description, do you favor or oppose a national tobacco policy to reduce tobacco use among
    kids? And do you strongly or somewhat (favor/oppose) such a policy?<br>
    <br>
    Response: Percentage:<br>
    ----------- -------------<br>
    Favor (Net) 75.1<br>
    Strongly Favor 62.4<br>
    Somewhat Favor 12.7<br>
    Oppose (Net) 21.7<br>
    Strongly Oppose 15.3<br>
    Somewhat Oppose 6.4<br>
    Don't Know/Refused 3.2<br>
    ------<br>
    The sample of voters was then split in half at random, with each sub-sample asked a
    separate question. One sub-sample was simply asked how the effect of a candidate's
    position on a national tobacco control policy would affect their vote. The other
    sub-sample was asked how it would affect their vote if one candidate took tobacco money
    and opposed national tobacco policy, while the other refused tobacco money and supported
    such a policy.<br>
    --<br>
    SPLIT SAMPLE (Each version asked of one-half the sample)<br>
    <br>
    Version A<br>
    Q2a: Other things equal, if one candidate for Congress opposes a national tobacco policy
    and the other supports a national tobacco policy, would you be more likely to vote for the
    candidate who opposes a national tobacco policy, or the candidate who supports a national
    tobacco policy, or would it make no difference in your vote? (Would you be much more
    likely or somewhat more likely to vote for that candidate?)<br>
    <br>
    Response: Percentage:<br>
    ----------- -------------<br>
    Supports Policy (Net) 38.9<br>
    Much more likely 28.6<br>
    Somewhat more likely 12.2<br>
    Opposes Policy (Net) 17.1<br>
    Much more likely 11.6<br>
    Somewhat more likely 5.4<br>
    No Difference 40.3<br>
    Don't Know/Refused 3.9<br>
    --<br>
    Version B<br>
    Q2b: Other things equal, if one candidate for Congress accepts campaign contributions from
    the tobacco industry and opposes a national tobacco policy and the other refuses tobacco
    money and supports a national tobacco policy, would you be more likely to vote for the
    candidate who takes tobacco money and opposes a national tobacco policy, or the candidate
    who refuses to take tobacco money and supports a national tobacco policy, or would it make
    no difference in your vote? (Would you be much more likely or somewhat more likely to vote
    for that candidate?)<br>
    <br>
    Response: Percentage:<br>
    ----------- -------------<br>
    Supports Policy/Refuses Money (Net) 46.5<br>
    Much more likely 29.5<br>
    Somewhat more likely 17.0<br>
    Opposes Policy/Takes Money (Net) 7.0<br>
    Much more likely 4.4<br>
    Somewhat more likely 2.6<br>
    No Difference 42.4<br>
    Don't Know/Refused 4.1<br>
    <br>
    The survey was conducted by Market Facts' TeleNation from July 6-8, 1998. The full sample
    of 835 registered voters has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points,
    while the two sub-samples have a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.9 percentage points.<br>
    ------<br>
    The Washington, D.C.-based CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS is the largest initiative ever
    undertaken to decrease youth tobacco use in the United States. Its mandate is to focus the
    nation's attention and action on keeping tobacco marketing from seducing children, and
    making tobacco less accessible to kids.<p align="center">-0-</td>
