    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">SAN FRANCISCO - July 22 - In a major victory for gun control groups, San
    Francisco Superior Court Judge Raymond Williamson has ordered California Attorney General
    Dan Lungren to stop registering illegally-owned assault weapons.<br>
    <br>
    Judge Williamson ruled that Lungren, who is running for governor, has acted without
    authority by continuing to register thousands of illegally-owned assault weapons after the
    May 30, 1992 registration deadline established by the California assault weapon ban. The
    ruling will not only force Lungren to cease new registrations of assault weapons, but will
    also require a review of past registrations authorized by Lungren to determine whether the
    weapons were legally registered. Possession of unregistered assault weapons is a crime.<br>
    <br>
    Handgun Control Inc. and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, both chaired by Sarah
    Brady, filed suit on Dec. 16, 1997, to stop Lungren from registering assault weapons after
    the law's deadline. The groups argued that Lungren's unauthorized registration scheme
    undercut California's landmark assault weapon ban by allowing illegally-owned guns to
    remain in California and encouraging underground trafficking of assault weapons into the
    state where Lungren allowed them to be kept and registered.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Attorney General Lungren has violated California's assault weapons ban and
    threatened the safety of the state's citizens,&quot; said Mrs. Brady. &quot;By illegally
    registering assault weapons, the attorney general has allowed UZIs and AK-47s to flow into
    the illegal market and into criminal hands. I am delighted that Judge Williamson has put a
    stop to this unconscionable behavior and will force the attorney general to uphold the
    laws of his state.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Assault weapons that are illegal in California may be purchased in other states and then
    smuggled into California where they been registered by Lungren and made &quot;legal.&quot;
    A Los Angeles Times investigation found that thousands of assault weapons have been
    registered since the deadline passed. In fact, gun dealers in other states have been
    informing California buyers that Lungren's registration scheme allows them to evade the
    law.<br>
    <br>
    The purpose of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapon Control Act was to freeze the number of
    assault weapons available in California and thus to prevent people from buying them in
    other states and bringing them into California. The law was passed in 1989 following a
    massacre in a Stockton schoolyard, in which 30 people were shot and five children killed
    with an AK-47. In addition to banning the future manufacture and sale of assault weapons
    in California, the statute allowed people to possess assault weapons only if they already
    legally-owned the guns at the time the statute was passed -- and registered the guns prior
    to the deadline. Despite the cut-off date, Attorney General Lungren has continued to allow
    thousands of people to register such weapons without even requiring proof that the weapons
    had been purchased before the ban took effect.<br>
    <br>
    The San Francisco law firm of Morrison &amp; Foerster is providing pro bono legal
    representation to Handgun Control Inc., and its educational affiliate, the Center to
    Prevent Handgun Violence, in bringing the lawsuit against Attorney General Lungren.<br>
    <br>
    ------<br>
    <br>
    Handgun Control Inc., chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's largest citizens' gun
    control lobbying organization. With its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and field offices
    in California and other states. HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun
    control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI has more than
    400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the country to enact and
    protect reasonable gun control laws.<br>
    ------<br>
    The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, also chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1983
    to reduce gun violence through education, legal advocacy, research and outreach to the
    entertainment community. CPHV's national initiatives include prevention programs for
    parents and youth on the risks associated with guns, legal representation for gun violence
    victims, work with the entertainment community to encourage deglamorization of guns in the
    media, and research of the risks associated with guns and the efficacy of gun control
    laws. More information about both HCI and CPHV can be found on the website at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">http://www.handguncontrol.org</a>.<p align="center">-0-</td>
