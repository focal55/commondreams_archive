    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 17 -&nbsp; With most states already recording
    unhealthful smog levels this summer, a new report discloses that the nation's 100 largest
    power companies vary dramatically in their pollution performance.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Some electric companies put out pollution at more than 10 times the rate of other
    companies,&quot; noted David G. Hawkins, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
    Council (NRDC).<br>
    <br>
    The report, prepared by the NRDC and Public Service Electric and Gas Co., found that
    pollution rates &quot;vary widely&quot; among the power companies. Without &quot;effective
    safeguards,&quot; electricity deregulation could &quot;exacerbate&quot; smog and other
    pollution problems, the report added.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The wide disparity in pollution from electricity suppliers demonstrates the need to
    include requirements for pollution caps as an integral part of electric industry
    deregulation legislation,&quot; Hawkins emphasized.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As this summer of smog so vividly demonstrates, we must reduce pollution from dirty
    power plants to protect children, seniors and others susceptible to smog,&quot; noted
    Hawkins. He added that an EPA proposal to reduce smog-forming nitrogen oxides in 22
    Eastern states &quot;clearly is a much-needed step in the right direction.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The report shows that the 100 largest power companies are responsible for approximately 90
    percent of national utility emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon
    dioxide. The largest 20 companies account for nearly half the emissions. Loopholes in
    current law permit more pollution from older power plants, the report notes. &quot;Unless
    these loopholes are closed, it will be cheaper to run dirtier plants, and that will lead
    to even more pollution,&quot; Hawkins added.<br>
    <br>
    At least 34 states and the District of Columbia have already recorded smog levels this
    year above the federal health standard. &quot;Not surprisingly, many of the problems are
    taking place in areas with the dirtiest power plants, including Ohio, West Virginia,
    Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky,&quot; Hawkins noted. He added that long-range transport
    of power plant pollution is exacerbating problems in downwind states. (See below for 10
    &quot;biggest&quot; utility NOx polluters and 10 &quot;dirtiest&quot; utility NOx
    polluters).<br>
    <br>
    Included with the report is a CD-ROM which contains extensive information on each power
    company.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As the electric industry deregulates and starts competing for customers, consumers
    need more tools to know what they're buying,&quot; Hawkins noted. &quot;While every cereal
    box tells you what's in the product, the slick brochures you'll be getting from folks
    trying to sell you electricity won't tell you how clean or dirty their power is. Our
    report and CD-ROM are intended to fill the gap until we get policies adopted that will
    require power sellers to label their wares, and policies that require this environmentally
    harmful sector to clean up its act.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Hawkins added, &quot;The report will be a tool for citizens and policy makers at local,
    state and federal levels.&quot; The report also points out that:<br>
    <br>
    -- Electric power companies &quot;contribute significantly&quot; not only to smog, but to
    &quot;multiple environmental problems,&quot; including acid rain, visibility impairment,
    fine particle pollution, eutrophication of lakes and streams, climate change and toxic air
    pollution.<br>
    <br>
    -- Disclosure of company-specific emissions performance will enhance efforts to mitigate
    pollution problems as the electricity industry is restructured.<br>
    <br>
    -- Independent power companies or &quot;non-utility generators&quot; now account for
    approximately 11 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. Many of these
    plants do not currently report their emissions to EPA, and, in fact, many of them don't
    have continuous emission monitors. &quot;Consumers must have the right to know how much
    pollution is coming from all power producers,&quot; Hawkins said.<br>
    <br>
    The information is based on the most recently available (1996) data reported to the U.S.
    Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Information Administration at the
    Department of Energy. Copies of the report, Benchmarking Air Emissions of Electric Utility
    Generators in the United States, are available from the Natural Resources Defense Council.
    The report is also available on the Internet at http://www.nrdc.org/nrdcpro.<br>
