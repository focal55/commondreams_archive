    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 21 - In a letter to HRC executive director Elizabeth
    Birch, Green Bay Packers president and CEO Robert E. Harlan apologized today for their
    star football player and anti-gay activist Reggie White's &quot;inappropriate&quot; use of
    the teams uniform in an ad campaign orchestrated by Right Wing political lobbying groups.
    &nbsp; Today's action is welcomed as a signal that the National Football League and the
    Green Bay Packers have not endorsed White's anti-gay rhetoric, asserts the Human Rights
    Campaign.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are pleased that the Green bay Packers organization has indicated that they will
    not tolerate Reggie White intentionally using the prestige of the team or the NFL to
    legitimize discrimination against gay Americans.&nbsp; I am sure that there are many gay
    and lesbian Green Bay Packers fans, as well the majority of fair minded Packers fans, who
    are relieved that the team is not officially sanctioning White's ill-informed
    rhetoric,&quot; said Birch.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The use of the Packers uniform in this case -- as Greg Aiello, the National Football
    League's vice president of public relations acknowledged in a recent public statement --
    was not approved and was an inappropriate use of the uniform.&nbsp; And we obviously
    concur in that view.&nbsp; As an organization, we regret the misuse of our uniform in the
    advertisement.&nbsp; Please accept our apology,&quot; said Harlan in his letter. <br>
    <br>
    By appearing in his Green Bay Packer uniform in a full page anti-gay ad in the Washington
    Times today, White has again violated NFL rules which prohibit players from using official
    league property, such as a uniform, to push a personal political agenda.&nbsp; With
    today's ad, Reggie White and his Right Wing political sponsors broke their promise to the
    NFL and Green Bay Packers that White would no longer appear in uniform in future ads. <br>
    <br>
    In response to White's misuse of the NFL logo, Elizabeth Birch wrote a letter to Green Bay
    Packer President and CEO Robert E. Harlan asking him to clarify the team's stance on this
    issue.&nbsp; Harlan's letter today was in response to Birch's letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Reggie White has the right to state his beliefs in these ads or any other forum.
    &nbsp; No one has questioned his right, certainly not the Human Rights Campaign.
    &nbsp; However, this is America and we also have the right to exercise free speech and to
    question the accuracy and political motives behind this ad campaign,&quot; said HRC
    communications director and senior strategist David M. Smith. <br>
    <br>
    The Human Rights Campaign, the largest national lesbian and gay political organization,
    with members throughout the country, effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign
    support, and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open,
    honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the community.<p align="center">-- 30 --</td>
