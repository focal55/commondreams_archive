    decried the sweeping efforts of the government of Puerto Rico to privatize public
    services.<br>
    <br>
    In a policy resolution adopted at the AFT's biennial convention, the more than 3,500
    delegates representing nearly 1 million members lent their support to the Federacion de
    Maestros (FMPR), striking telephone workers, and the people of Puerto Rico in their
    efforts to preserve quality public services.<br>
    <br>
    Renan Soto Soto, president of the FMPR, an AFT affiliate, said the unanimous vote in
    support of the people of Puerto Rico would add greater pressure on the government to
    &quot;abandon its plan for wholesale privatization of public services.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The delegates to this convention recognize that the government's efforts to
    privatize the phone company, public schools, water and electrical services, higher
    education and more are being done with little or no regard to the effect on the quality of
    services provided or the effect these changes will have on citizens who depend on these
    services,&quot; Soto continued.<br>
    <br>
    Telephone workers have been on strike over a month. FMPR, along with other unions,
    actively supported last week's historic two-day, island-wide work stoppage to protest the
    move to sell the phone system. Plans have been announced to finance a K-12 voucher program
    and to extend privatization to regional colleges, health care and other services upon
    which citizens rely.<br>
    <br>
    The AFT's resolution extended the full support of the AFT to &quot;the members of the
    Federacion, the telephone workers and the people of Puerto Rico in their efforts to
    preserve quality public services, protect public sector jobs and promote an honest and
    free dialogue on these important issues.&quot;<br>
    ------<br>
    The FMPR is an affiliate of the 985,000-member American Federation of Teachers and the
    AFL-CIO.<p align="center">-0-</td>
