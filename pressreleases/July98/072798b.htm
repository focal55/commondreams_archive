    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 27 -&nbsp; For decades, U.S. and foreign pesticide
    manufacturers have been feeding their products to rats, rabbits, mice, and guinea pigs in
    thousands of controlled laboratory studies, all designed to satisfy government regulatory
    requirements for chemicals that kill weeds, insects, rodents and other pests.<br>
    <br>
    Studies on lab animals are still routinely conducted for pesticides today. But in recent
    years, in a growing number of experiments that are raising ethical and scientific
    questions inside and outside government, the test animals are people. <br>
    <br>
    And for reasons neither U.S. nor British environmental officials can explain, most of the
    recent human pesticide experiments are being performed in England and Scotland. Four have
    been submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1992, and EPA
    regulators believe that more are underway in the U.K.<br>
    <br>
    Just last year, Amvac Chemical Corporation, a California pesticide company, hired a lab in
    England to conduct three related feeding trials using people to test the toxicity of a bug
    killer, dichlorvos, a common ingredient in pet collars and pest strips. Also, paid
    volunteer subjects drank doses of the extremely toxic insecticide aldicarb in a 1992 study
    in Scotland commissioned by Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemical giant. <br>
    <br>
    Neither EPA nor UK pesticide guidelines require human studies. EPA officials informally
    discourage such studies on ethical and scientific grounds, refusing even to review study
    methods beforehand. EPA, in fact, has no policies or oversight system in place to insure
    that humans involved in such experiments are protected.<br>
    <br>
    But the agency is nonetheless accepting human experimental studies submitted by pesticide
    companies, several of which have been used in at least two recent cases to soften EPA
    regulatory decisions. <br>
    <br>
    The growing use of human testing to solve U.S. regulatory problems was revealed in a new
    report from the Environmental Working Group, entitled &quot;The English Patients: Human
    Experiments and Pesticide Policy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In effect, by substituting people for lab rats, pesticide companies have been able to
    increase the amounts of pesticide that legally could be used on crops, or be detected on
    foods, in water, or in air. That is why more studies are underway in the U.K., according
    to EPA scientists, though they do not know how many, where they are being conducted, or
    for what pesticides.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Pesticide companies have a huge financial incentive to test people instead of other
    animals. They know that U.S. regulations on pesticides are finally being tightened. Human
    tests enable chemical companies to eliminate safety factors that have long been applied
    when nonhuman animals are used for testing,&quot; said EWG president Ken Cook, the
    report's author. &quot;Some companies have decided to relieve regulatory pressure on their
    bug killers in the United States by dosing up human subjects in the United Kingdom,&quot;
    Cook said. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We know from recent experience in medical research that human experimental subjects
    often do not really understand the implications of their decision to participate and that
    the oversight system is inadequate,&quot; Cook added, referring to a number of studies
    over the past few years by government inspectors in the United States. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;These pesticide experiments are being conducted on humans abroad, then accepted by
    the U.S. government in the absence of specific EPA regulations or monitoring capacity for
    human research. These companies are not testing medicines on people to see if they are
    therapeutic. They're testing toxic chemicals to see how high exposure can be without
    causing regulatory problems. No one ever benefits from being exposed to pesticides, &quot;
    Cook said.<br>
    <br>
    Citing ethical and scientific concerns, EWG said it strongly opposes human experiments
    that deliberately expose people to pesticides or other environmental toxins for the
    purpose of determining &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; levels of pollution for
    people. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Allowing human experiments, such as those conducted recently in the United Kingdom,
    to serve as the basis for registering pesticides, is ethically indefensible,&quot; Cook
    said. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Poor science involving humans is itself unethical,&quot; he noted. &quot;We question
    whether short-term feeding studies, conducted on a handful of healthy adults, can form the
    basis of any assurance that pesticides are safe for tens of millions of infants and
    children, as U.S. law now requires,&quot; Cook added. <br>
    <br>
    EWG is asking EPA to conduct a comprehensive study of the use of human subjects in past
    and recent environmental research, modeled after the landmark 1995 Presidential Advisory
    Committee on Human Radiation Experiments. Once the study is completed, EWG says, the EPA
    should issue policy and guidelines for public comment on the use of humans in
    environmental research. The rules must provide for thorough monitoring, EWG said,
    including consideration of special ethical considerations that distinguish human research
    on toxic contaminants from human research for drugs and medicines.<br>
    <br>
    EWG also recommended an immediate moratorium on human experimentation, of the type
    conducted for dichlorvos, aldicarb, and perhaps other pesticides, for purposes of
    pesticide regulation. The group also asked EPA to suspend any pesticide approvals if the
    agency is unable affirmatively to determine that the studies were conducted according to
    U.S. ethical standards.<p align="center">-30-</td>
