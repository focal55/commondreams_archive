    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 17 - Newt and Candace Gingrich's cousin, Darell
    Gingrich (twice removed), joined several other former &quot;ex-gays&quot; today to help
    refute this weeks misleading Right Wing misinformation newspaper ad campaign which claims
    gays can be changed through therapy and religion.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This right wing political ad campaign of misinformation and pseudo-science is
    hurting many people and is nothing more than a slick attempt to make discrimination
    against gay people safe and legal. They are desperately trying to legitimize anti-gay
    discrimination,&quot; said HRC communications director and senior strategist David M.
    Smith.<br>
    <br>
    The Right's ad campaign contradicts medical and mental health experts who say that
    homosexuality can not -- and should not -- be cured. In August 1997, the American
    Psychological Association overwhelmingly passed a resolution, at the APA convention, that
    asserts that there is no sound scientific evidence on the efficacy of &quot;reparative
    therapy,&quot; which seeks to &quot;cure&quot; homosexuals. In 1973, the American
    Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. Earlier
    this week, in response to these ads, the American Psychological Association again
    questioned the efficacy of so-called &quot;conversion therapy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For nearly three decades, it has been known that homosexuality is not a mental
    illness. Medical and mental health professionals also now know that sexual orientation is
    not a choice and cannot be altered. Groups who try to change the sexual orientation of
    people through so-called conversion therapy' are misguided and run the risk of causing a
    great deal of psychological harm to those they say they are trying to help,&quot; said
    American Psychological Association Executive Director Dr. Raymond Fowler.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I am here to say that these ex-gay' ministries dont work. Even though many of the
    people involved in these ministries might be well intentioned, they are causing pain in
    the lives of those who would be better off accepting how God created them,&quot; said
    former ex-gay' Darell Gingrich.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For fifteen years I endured the mental torment of the ex-gay' movement. I did
    everything they told me to do. I prayed. I spoke to church counselors. They had me
    convinced I was going to hell. I finally realized that the hell the ex-gay ministries
    spoke of was the life I was living by pretending I was a heterosexual. These groups prey
    on those who are gay and Christian and I really feel bad for those who are still caught in
    their web of deceit,&quot; said HRC senior policy advocate and former ex-gay' Tracey St.
    Pierre.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I entered the ex-gay' movement as a sixteen year Pentecostal who was afraid of going
    to hell. I quickly realized that this movement was dysfunctional and cured no one
    involved,&quot; said former ex-gay Matt Smith.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Make no mistake about it, these ads are politically motivated. It is not a
    coincidence that these ads are running the same week that extremist members in Congress
    have launched an unprecedented wave of anti-gay legislation. From the Hefley and Riggs
    amendments, to the attack on hate crimes legislation, the Far Right is orchestrating a
    highly organized political campaign against gay Americans,&quot; said HRC political
    director Winnie Stachelberg.<p align="center">###</td>
