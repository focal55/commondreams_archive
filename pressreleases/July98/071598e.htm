    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 15 - Today the AFL-CIO launched a nationwide
    grassroots campaign to send a message to Congress: working families want and need a strong
    Patients&#146; Bill of Rights and they want Congress to act quickly.<br>
    <br>
    The effort includes worksite mobilization and community outreach in scores of Democratic
    and Republican congressional districts, including television and radio spots that send
    messages urging support to 21 House members and five Senators.<br>
    <br>
    The Patients&#146; Bill of Rights Act, sponsored by Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) and Rep. Greg
    Ganske (R-IA) in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
    (D-SD) and Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) in the U.S. Senate, responds to widespread
    concerns about health care quality under HMOs by guaranteeing basic rights to health care
    consumers. The proposed legislation ensures the right to have treatment decisions made by
    your doctor and not insurance company bureaucrats, the right to see specialists whose care
    you need, the right to emergency room care when and where you need it, the right to appeal
    a health care decision with which you disagree, and the right to sue managed care
    companies.<br>
    <br>
    Overwhelming congressional support exists for this proposed legislation: over 182
    Democrats, seven Republicans, and one Independent have signed on as co-sponsors. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;No health care system should be built upon denying care instead of providing
    it,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.<br>
    <br>
    The health insurance industry is spending millions of dollars in advertising and lobbying
    to defeat the Patients&#146; Bill of Rights Act. Over the last year, HMOs have contributed
    heavily to many of the members of Congress who are resisting patient protection
    legislation. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;To derail real HMO reform, some members of Congress are introducing diluted bills<br>
    <br>
    which fall far short of providing the essential protections that patients need against an
    increasingly greedy health insurance industry,&quot; Sweeney said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Working families do not have to settle for a watered-down version of patient
    protections,&quot; he said. &quot;Politicians who compromise the vital patient protections
    included in the bill are engaging in election-year posturing while still carrying the
    water for the health insurance industry.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Nearly half of Americans say that they or someone they know has had a bad experience with
    an HMO, according to a recent poll conducted by Lake, Sosin, Snell, and Perry. More than
    90% of Americans believe that a patient protection act is needed and would support the
    provisions of the Patients&#146; Bill of Rights.<br>
    <br>
    Healthcare providers are also protesting the managed care industry&#146;s practices.
    Recently, more than 2000 physicians signed a manifesto which appeared in the Journal of
    the American Medical Association which said: &quot;Physicians and nurses are being prodded
    by threats and bribes to abdicate allegiance to patients, to shun the sickest who may be
    unprofitable. Some of us risk being fired or &#145;delisted&#146; for giving, or even
    discussing, expensive services, and many are offered bonuses for minimizing care.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The ads will run in the districts of eight Democratic and 13 Republican members of
    Congress. Of the Senators named in ads, four are Republicans and one is a Democrat.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the ads, the AFL-CIO has organized a national &quot;Call Congress
    Week&quot; during which working families will urge their representatives to support the
    bill. Union members will also hold meetings with their member of congress to press for
    action on the Patients&#146; Bill of Rights.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats working 2000 miles away, should decide
    what type of treatment you get and which medicines you take. It doesn&#146;t take a rocket
    scientist to realize that medical professionals should make medical decisions and that
    people, not profits, should guide health care decisions. It&#146;s just that simple &#151;
    and Americans know it,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.<br>
    <br>
    Unions represent more than one in four Americans with employer-based health insurance.
    Unions are also the largest group of organized healthcare purchasers and represent both
    providers and consumers of managed care. The ads are part of the organization&#146;s
    continuing educational outreach program to mobilize America&#146;s working families around
    issues central to their lives and futures. <p align="center">###</td>
