    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 31 - Despite record temperatures and the prevalent
    view of the scientific community, some denial about global warming has not melted. In
    recent days, a troop of global-warming deniers journeyed to Capitol Hill. <p>Patrick
    Michaels of the Cato Institute was among those who testified Wednesday disputing the
    scientific weight of evidence on climate change. A number of environmentalists and
    scientists are available for comment, including: </p>
    <p>KEVIN TRENBERTH </p>
    <p>Trenberth, who heads the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research, said: &quot;This is amazing in view of the heat wave going on in
    Texas and throughout the southern U.S., major flooding in Iowa and New England, major
    droughts throughout the world and many fires. Extremes of climate are indeed increasing,
    breaking records by substantial amounts. In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change stated `the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on
    global climate.' The evidence has since increased. These effects are costing billions of
    dollars, they are not benign. Michaels has few publications that indicate that he has
    scientific credentials in this area. When he shows up to conferences, the talk he gives is
    political, not a scientific talk.&quot; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>BRANDON MacGILLIS <p>MacGillis, director of campaigns for Ozone Action, is critical of
        Michaels and others who dispute global warming. &quot;Michaels is a vocal skeptic of
        global warming who receives funding from a number of corporate interests who share his
        views,&quot; MacGillis said. &quot;Among them are the Edison Electric Institute, the
        German Coal Mining Association and the Western Fuels Association. This fossil fuel money
        provides a very loud platform that is out of proportion to the dearth of supporting
        evidence for skeptic scientists, like Michaels, who claim there is no scientific link
        between human activities and climate change.&quot; </p>
      </li>
      <li>WENONAH HAUTER <p>Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project,
        said: &quot;Michaels has no credibility on the subject of climate change; he is a hired
        gun for the fossil fuel industry. Vested interests, like the ones that fund Michaels, care
        only about their profits, not the gamble that the human race is taking by failing to
        immediately and significantly reduce emissions. In 1997, worldwide temperatures were at
        their highest levels in recorded history. This continues a steady, upward trend that most
        meteorologists believe is powerful evidence that people are changing the Earth's
        climate.&quot; </p>
