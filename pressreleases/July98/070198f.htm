    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 1 - Citizen movements working from coast to coast to
    get special interest money out of politics are gaining significant momentum and gathering
    support from a broad array of civic and business organizations and elected officials from
    both sides of the aisle. <br>
    <br>
    This week, Clean Money coalitions in Arizona, Massachusetts and New York City filed enough
    petition signatures &#150; over 400,000 in all &#150; to qualify their initiatives for the
    November ballot, an early indication of the strength of grassroots organizations and
    popular support for cleaning up the campaign finance system. <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate has &#150; for all intents and purposes &#150; shut down debate
    on campaign finance reform and efforts in the House of Representatives are falling prey to
    partisan gamesmanship and a demonstrable lack of political will. But grassroots activity
    throughout the country demonstrates that support for reforming the campaign finance system
    is strong and voters are taking matters into their own hands. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;These vibrant grassroots movements demonstrate that citizens across this country
    want to fix a system that it is fundamentally undemocratic and corrupt, despite the fact
    that politicians in Washington want to protect the status quo,&quot; said Ellen Miller,
    executive director of Public Campaign. &quot;It is true that if the people will lead, then
    the leaders will follow.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Citizen coalitions in Arizona, Massachusetts and New York City are working on behalf of
    Clean Money Campaign Reform, a comprehensive approach that offers politicians an
    alternative way to finance their campaigns without relying on special interest money.
    Clean Money Campaign Reform reduces the influence of special interests, stops the money
    chase that candidates are currently caught in, and establishes a level playing field so
    all qualified candidates can run competitively. Clean Money is a fresh and simple
    alternative to the present campaign finance system. <br>
    <br>
    ARIZONA<br>
    Over 195,000 Arizona signatures were filed with the Secretary of State's office on June 29
    in support of the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Initiative, 82,000 more than needed to
    qualify for the November ballot. Arizona has witnessed a spate of campaign finance
    scandals over recent years ranging from ABSCAM and the Keating Five to the indictment of
    former Governor Fyfe Symington. The initiative is sponsored by the Arizona League of Women
    Voters, the State <br>
    <br>
    Legislative Committee of AARP and others, along with a bi-partisan array of current and
    former elected officials, academics and civic and business leaders. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;By taking matters into our own hands, Arizonans have an opportunity to take the lead
    nationally on reforming our campaign laws,&quot; said Lila Schwartz, President of the
    Arizona League of Women Voters. <br>
    <br>
    MASSACHUSETTS<br>
    Bringing the total to over 150,000 signatures, today Massachusetts filed more than 30,000
    additional signatures with the Secretary of State's Office, placing the Clean Elections
    Initiative before voters this coming November. In Massachusetts, state-house lobbyists are
    the single largest category of contributors to legislative campaigns and the candidate who
    raises and spends the most wins 92 percent of the time. Two-thirds of the races for the
    legislature in 1998 will be completely uncontested. The initiative has gained support from
    a broad array of citizens including the former CEO of Stride Rite shoes Arnold Hiatt,
    president emeritus and current Common Cause board chair Derek Bok, former Lt. Governor
    Evelyn Murphy and others. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Most of the money for Massachusetts campaigns comes from those who want something in
    return, but voters in our state are determined to end government of, by and for the
    wealthy special interests,&quot; commented David Donnelly, campaign manager for Mass
    Voters for Clean Elections. <br>
    <br>
    NEW YORK CITY<br>
    In the financial capital of America, 60,000 signatures &#150; more than enough to qualify
    the Clean Money, Clean Elections Initiative for the November ballot &#150; were turned in
    at City Hall today. In a city where almost half the money raised by candidates for mayor
    comes from the 5 percent of contributors who can give $5000 or more and where
    contributions to the two major mayoral candidates from those who live outside the City
    exceeded the total amount raised from the four outer boroughs, the New York initiative has
    garnered the endorsement of two of the City's wealthiest and most prominent campaign
    contributors, Bruce Ratner and Douglas Durst. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;New York City is the financial, media and campaign contribution capital of America.
    What we do here in New York will resonate across the country and help create a national
    movement for reform,&quot; said Richard Schrader, director of the citywide effort. <br>
    <br>
    Clean Money Campaign Reform is already law in Maine where voters passed it by ballot
    initiative in 1996 and in Vermont, where the state legislature passed it &#150; and the
    Governor signed into law &#150; in 1997. In addition to Arizona, Massachusetts and New
    York City, coalitions in over 40 other states are also working on behalf of Clean Money
    Campaign Reform. <br>

    Public Campaign is a national non-profit, non-partisan organization working on behalf of
    comprehensive campaign finance reform.<p align="center">###</td>
