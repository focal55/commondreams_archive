    Weapon Ban Becomes International Law</font></strong></td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 29 - Human Rights Watch today warned that the Pentagon
    is developing laser weapons that could undermine a new international ban on blinding
    lasers, which takes effect tomorrow.&nbsp; In a letter to Secretary of Defense William
    Cohen, the rights group said that numerous U.S. laser programs, now in the research and
    development phase, may not violate the letter of the ban treaty, but could subvert its
    purpose and intent.&nbsp; Human Rights Watch warned that unless the U.S. upholds the ban
    more effectively, American servicemen themselves could face blinding laser-type weapons on
    the battlefield.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are witnessing an explosion of so-called dazzling laser weapon programs that
    could prove to be, in effect, blinding laser weapons in disguise,&quot; said Stephen
    Goose, program director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch.&nbsp; &quot;There is a
    real danger that the procurement and spread of such weapons could render the blinding
    laser ban <br>
    meaningless,&quot; said Goose.<br>
    <br>
    Dazzling or glare-producing lasers have as their primary function attacking human eyes.
    &nbsp; In the letter to Secretary Cohen, Human Rights Watch writes, &quot;The distinction
    between a dazzling laser and a blinding laser remains disconcertingly unclear. We fear
    that weapons labeled as dazzlers could easily be used to blind intentionally, and that
    weapons labeled as dazzlers will proliferate greatly throughout the world.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Since 1995, when the U.S. agreed to the Blinding Laser Protocol of the Convention on
    Conventional Weapons, the Pentagon has cancelled several blinding laser weapon programs.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; President Clinton has stated that the U.S. will abide by the terms of the
    protocol, even though the Senate has yet to ratify it&nbsp; The protocol won the requisite
    twenty ratifications six months ago, and now enters into force on July 30.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Human Rights Watch identifies and provides details on a host of laser weapon programs of
    concern, including BOSS, Persuader, LX-5, Maglite, Saber 203, TLOS, Green Laser, Nighthawk
    and Y-Blue.&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, it appears that the very blinding laser weapons
    that were being developed prior to the 1995 policy (e.g., Saber 203, LCMS/TLOS) are being
    modified for deployment as dazzlers, with just a less apparent blinding attribute.<br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch also expresses concern that lasers originally developed for dazzling
    and blinding missions are being offered to law enforcement agencies and potentially for
    commercial sale.&nbsp; In one notable example, a California-based company, Light
    Solutions, is reportedly developing a dazzling counter-terrorism &quot;green laser&quot;
    for the Army on behalf of the U.S. Secret Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; A secret &quot;black&quot;
    program, this laser is intended to defend the White House and other government buildings
    in Washington from someone who might employ a light plane or helicopter in an attack.<br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch writes, &quot;The emergence of operational lasers intended to attack
    eyes ultimately has the effect of undermining the humanitarian and nonproliferation
    objectives of Protocol IV [Blinding Lasers].&nbsp; U.S. military personnel are thus more
    likely to face blinding lasers on the battlefield.&nbsp; The emergence of anti-personnel
    lasers in the civilian world also opens the way for criminal elements to obtain
    anti-personnel lasers.&nbsp; For the U.S. to research and deploy these systems undermines
    the `norm' against blinding that Protocol IV represents.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A July 1996 U.S. intelligence report, Worldwide Laser Capabilities, obtained by Human
    Rights Watch under the Freedom of Information Act, concludes, &quot;Global proliferation
    of laser weapons is a real possibility.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; It states that &quot;Russia
    leads the world in the development of laser blinding weapons,&quot; and reveals that
    Jordan has imported a laser dazzler. <br>
    <br>
    The Human Rights Watch letter asks Secretary Cohen to:<br>
    <br>
    * provide additional details about the laser weapon systems identified&nbsp; in its
    letter, particularly about their capacity to be used to blind&nbsp; permanently<br>
    <br>
    * clarify the distinction between blinding lasers and dazzling lasers<br>
    <br>
    * articulate U.S. policy regarding development and use of lasers to attack human eyes<br>
    <br>
    * explain the seeming contradiction between development of dazzling lasers and the DOD
    policy against lasers that even temporarily blind <br>
    <br>
    * provide an explanation of how the U.S. will ensure that dazzling lasers, as potentially
    blinding weapons, will not be used to blind<br>
    <br>
    * provide assurances that the U.S. is not seeking to undermine the letter or spirit of
    Protocol IV.<br>
    <br>
    The letter was accompanied by several fact sheets about lasers in the U.S. inventory, as
    well as copies of earlier correspondence between Human Rights Watch, Senator Patrick
    Leahy, and then-Secretary of Defense William Perry.&nbsp; Copies of the letter and other
    materials are available upon request. <p align="center">###</td>
