    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 13 - Employees of small firms receive lower wages,
    fewer benefits, and less job security than their counterparts at large companies,
    according to a report released today by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).<br>
    <br>
    The report finds that, despite the commonly held view that small business is an engine of
    economic growth in the U.S., small firms (less than 50 employees) do not generate more
    jobs on net than large firms and the quality of the jobs they create is inferior to large
    businesses.<br>
    <br>
    In the new volume Small Consolation: The Dubious Benefits of Small Business for Job Growth
    and Wages, authors Dale Belman and Erica L. Groshen examine the quality of jobs created by
    small firms, and Julia Lane and David W. Stevens examine the contribution of the small
    business sector to overall job creation in the economy.<br>
    <br>
    The study also finds that:<br>
    <br>
    Employees of large firms (1,000 or more employees) are better compensated than small
    business employees. Large firm employees earn on average 39% more than employees at<br>
    small firms.<br>
    <br>
    Workers at large firms receive better benefits than their counterparts at small firms:
    68.7% of employees at large firms are covered by pension plans, compared to only 13.2% of
    employees at small firms. Also, 78.4% of large firm employees have health insurance, while
    only 30% of those employed at small firms receive health insurance.<br>
    <br>
    Large firms provide better job security. Job tenure averages 8.5 years at large firms,
    nearly double the 4.4 years that workers at firms with less than 25 employees enjoy.<br>
    <br>
    While new and expanding small business create new jobs at a higher rate than their larger
    counterparts, they also eliminate jobs at a higher rate. <br>
    <br>
    According to the authors, the advantage large firms have enjoyed in offering better
    compensation and benefits has persisted for over a century and exists across all types of
    workers, industries, and countries. The study also shows that the gap between large- and
    small-firm compensation has been widening, not declining, over the last two decades.<br>
    <br>
    The study points out that small business has long been lauded as a source of economic
    virtues such as job growth, entrepreneurship, innovation, cost reduction and flexibility.
    As a result, small firms receive preferential treatment with respect to public policy and
    laws, often remaining exempt from the labor and environmental oversight and regulation
    that large firms must abide by. <br>
    <br>
    For example, firms with under $500,000 in revenue are not covered by minimum wage laws and
    companies with under 50 employees are not subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act nor
    are they required to file affirmative action plans. &quot;Public policy, rather than
    favoring small business by exempting it from many forms of regulation, should strive to be
    size neutral,&quot; the study concludes.<br>
