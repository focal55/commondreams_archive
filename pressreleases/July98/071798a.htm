    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">ROME - July 17 - On the last day of a five-week conference to establish
    an International Criminal Court, Human Rights Watch vowed to fight to the finish on two
    major &quot;escape clauses&quot; in the draft treaty.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The proposed ICC would prosecute future acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war
    crimes, but the two loopholes would significantly reduce its reach.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The first loophole would prevent the court from taking a case unless one of two states had
    given its consent: the state where the crimes took place, or the state of nationality of
    the accused - which in most instances will be the same. Previous formulations, supported
    by a large majority of delegations at the ICC conference, were less restrictive. Human
    Rights Watch demanded that the &quot;custodial state,&quot; or the country where the
    accused is found, should also be able to turn the suspect over to the court.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &quot;This court gives a passport to traveling tyrants,&quot; said Richard Dicker, who
    leads the ICC campaign for Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization
    based in New York. &quot;We hope this court will prosecute and punish war criminals. But
    at the very least, it should keep the Pol Pots and Saddam Husseins locked up at
    home.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The second major loophole would allow countries to &quot;opt out&quot; of the court's
    jurisdiction for war crimes for a period of seven years - even if they have ratified the
    treaty. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &quot;This sends a message to potential war criminals - you've got six-and-a-half years to
    do the job,&quot; said Dicker. &quot;That's not justice. That's nonsense.&quot; He called
    on governments to give public pledges not to use the &quot;opt out&quot; protocol. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Dicker noted that the draft treaty did contain several provisions that Human Rights Watch
    had strongly supported. They include: an independent prosecutor, automatic jurisdiction
    for genocide and crimes against humanity, broad authority over civil wars and gender-based
    persecution, and prohibitions against the use of child soldiers. &quot;We'll do everything
    we can to make sure this flawed court does what it's supposed to do: bring justice to
    victims,&quot; said Dicker.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Dicker called on delegations to resist ongoing U.S. pressure to further weaken the treaty.
    &quot;The U.S. is still seeking an iron-clad guarantee that its citizens will never be
    brought before this court,&quot; said Dicker. &quot;But the guarantees it wants would let
    most tyrants escape justice, too.&quot;<p align="center">###</td>
