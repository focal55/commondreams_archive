    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 23 - A recent analysis by the Environmental Defense
    Fund (EDF) details the potential impacts of global warming on the Washington, DC area. The
    analysis, Global Warming: Our Nation's Capital At Risk, examines how global warming and
    sea level rise could increase the risk of flooding, disease, and heat stress in Washington
    as well as threaten beaches in Ocean City, Maryland and the islands and ecosystem of the
    Chesapeake Bay. The analysis is based in part on data developed by the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which operates under United Nations auspices and draws on
    thousands of scientists worldwide to advise governments on the scientific consensus on
    climate change. The IPCC projects that the Earth will warm by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit,
    and that sea levels will rise by one-half to three feet by the year 2100.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Washington currently averages about 36 days a year above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
    While projections of temperature changes for any particular area include large
    uncertainties, our analysis showed that the Washington area would experience an average of
    60 days per year above 90 degrees Fahrenheit given warming of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the
    IPCC's 'best estimate' scenario of the amount of global warming by the end of the next
    century. Another scenario, warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit, produced as many as 87 days
    that hot. Such temperatures would put both young and elderly at risk. An additional health
    threat is the reemergence or increased incidence of mosquito-borne diseases such as
    malaria, dengue fever, and eastern equine encephalitis. Mosquito-control and other public
    health programs in the Washington area would have to be initiated or expanded to address
    the additional risks,&quot; said EDF scientist Dr. Janine Bloomfield.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For Washington, sea-level rise could increase the risk of flooding from the Potomac
    during large storms, threatening the Mall, Georgetown, and the Tidal Basin cherry trees.
    Some beaches in Ocean City as well as historic Chesapeake Bay island communities could be
    lost to the sea-level rise associated with global warming unless expensive adaptive
    strategies are vastly expanded. The existing populations of fish, bird and shellfish of
    the Chesapeake ecosystem may be decimated by the combination of sea level rise and warmer
    temperatures,&quot; said Bloomfield.<br>
