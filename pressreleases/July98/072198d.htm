    Squashing Legislation to Protect Kids from Guns</font></strong></td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 21 - Following is a statement by Sarah Brady, chair of
    Handgun Control Inc., today on the Republican leadership in the U.S. Senate squashing
    legislation to protect kids from guns:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The recent spate of school yard shootings have shown us what can happen when
    children have unbridled access to guns. And many more tragedies involving kids and guns
    happen every day, but never appear on the front page. We lose more than 400 young people
    ages 19 and under to unintentional shootings every year; many more die in gun suicides.
    Child safety locks on guns can prevent many of these senseless deaths.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That is why it is so appalling that the U.S. Senate today voted (61-39) to table
    proposed legislation sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), which would have required
    child safety locks to be sold with every handgun in the United States. Offered as an
    amendment to the fiscal year 1989 Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Bill, this
    common-sense measure to protect kids from guns fell victim to the NRA's stronghold over
    the Senate leadership.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In fact, Sen. Larry Craig, who sits on the NRA's Board of Directors, offered a
    toothless alternative amendment, which will do nothing to improve gun safety and provided
    many members of the Senate with a smokescreen to disguise their votes against children's
    safety. Mr. Craig's amendment, which passed 72-28, simply requires gun dealers to make gun
    locks available for sale, but does NOT require that they are sold with every handgun. This
    amendment is a face-saving measure, which will have no impact because most gun stores
    already carry gun locks as part of their standard inventory.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is unconscionable that as our nation is still in mourning over the loss of so
    many innocent children to gun violence this year, the Senate leadership is kow-towing to
    the gun lobby and turning its back on the 86 percent of the American public that supports
    this legislation.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When will our nation's leaders recognize that we all have a role to play in
    preventing gun injury and death among our children? Gun owners must lock up guns out of
    children's reach; non-gun- owning parents must make sure their children never play in
    homes where guns are left accessible; and the gun industry must do its part to encourage
    proper gun storage by selling locks with all handguns and working harder to make guns that
    are more childproof.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As the November elections approach, many members of the Senate will be hard-pressed
    to explain their votes to the people they claim to represent. When it came to a choice
    between children and the gun industry, they rejected children and sided with the gun
    industry. Shame!&quot;<br>
