    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 20 - An overwhelming majority of Kansas voters want
    the Senate to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), according to a new
    bipartisan, statewide poll released today. When asked: &quot;Do you think the U.S. Senate
    should approve a Treaty with 140 other countries that would prohibit underground nuclear
    weapons explosions worldwide,&quot; 79% of Kansas voters said the treaty should be
    &quot;approved,&quot; while only 14% &quot;disapprove.&quot; Support for the treaty is
    strong among Republicans (81% approve), Democrats (79% approve) and independents (79%),
    and in all regions of the state. Support for the CTBT in Kansas (79%) is even higher than
    it is nationwide (73%, according to a May 1998 survey).<br>
    <br>
    The Kansas poll was commissioned by the&nbsp; Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a
    &nbsp; non-partisan alliance of 17 of the nation's leading&nbsp; arms control
    organizations. The survey results are&nbsp; based on the findings of an opinion survey of
    501 registered Kansas voters conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide, a Republican polling firm,
    and&nbsp; Democratic firm, The Mellman Group from June&nbsp; 20-24, 1998. The statistical
    margin for error for the sample as a whole is plus or minus 4.4 %.<br>
    <br>
    The test ban treaty was submitted to the Senate last&nbsp; year, but the Senate has so far
    failed to even begin&nbsp; debate on the pact, which has gained new significance since
    India and Pakistan conducted&nbsp; nuclear blasts in May and June. Sixty-seven votes
    &nbsp; are needed for Senate ratification. The current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
    staff and four&nbsp; previous chairmen, including Gen. Colin Powell,&nbsp; have endorsed
    the CTBT. President Clinton and other world leaders say that the CTBT is vital to curbing
    nuclear proliferation and encouraging India &amp; Pakistan to sign the CTBT and end their
    arms race.<br>
    <br>
    Kansans Consider the Test Ban &quot;More Important&quot; after the South Asian tests:
    Despite the&nbsp; repeated calls, Senate leaders Trent Lott (R-MS) and Jesse Helms (R-NC)
    have defied public opinion and labeled the treaty &quot;irrelevant.&quot; However, Kansans
    disagree. Sixty-nine percent of Kansans said that they think the recent nuclear tests by
    India and Pakistan &quot;demonstrate how important it is for the U.S. to ratify and
    encourage global implementation of the CTBT.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Kansans have a high level of awareness of the nuclear testing by India and Pakistan.
    &nbsp; Eighty-two percent of Kansas voters say the have heard about the tests, with 86%
    saying the tests pose a &quot;serious threat to international security.&quot; Knowledge of
    the recent India-Pakistan tests serves to increase support for the treaty. Among those who
    had heard a &quot;great deal&quot; or &quot;some&quot; about these tests, support of the
    treaty is overwhelming (82% approve, while only 12% disapprove).<br>
    <br>
    Kansas voters were also asked whether they &quot;favor&quot; or &quot;oppose&quot; a
    variety of possible U.S. government responses to the tests by India and Pakistan. An
    overwhelming 84% favor urging India and Pakistan to approve the test ban and 70% favor
    U.S. ratification of the CTBT as the best responses. These proposals were far more popular
    than imposing sanctions (61% in favor, 28% opposed), or increasing military spending to
    develop and deploy a nuclear missile defense (31% in favor, 61% opposed).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Senate's do-nothing approach on the test ban treaty is irresponsible and
    dangerous. It hurts efforts to protect America and the world from the proliferation of
    nuclear weapons and the possibility of nuclear war. The overwhelming public support for
    the test ban is a wake-up call for the Senate to approve the treaty and stop nuclear
    blasts worldwide,&quot; says Daryl Kimball, Director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear
    Dangers.<br>
    <br>
    Another survey question reveals that when given the choice between two possible candidates
    for Senate: one who supports the CTBT and the other who opposes the CTBT, 70% of Kansans
    solidly prefer a candidate who supports the CTBT (while only 22% would support a candidate
    who opposes the treaty).<p align="center">-- 30 --</p>
