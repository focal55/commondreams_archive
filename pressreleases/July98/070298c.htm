    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Olympia, WA - July 2 -&nbsp; Washington Citizens for Medical Rights, a
    broad coalition of doctors, patients and state citizens, submitted more than 230,000
    signatures today to place Initiative 692, the Washington State Medical Use of Marijuana
    act, on the November 3 ballot.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;These signatures represent thousands of citizens who care about relieving the
    suffering of patients with terminal or debilitating illnesses such as cancer and
    AIDS,&quot; states Tacoma physician, Dr. Rob Killian, sponsor of the initiative. &quot;We
    have worked with doctors, patients, law enforcement and legislators to bring Washington
    voters an initiative that is tightly drafted, narrowly focused, and protects the
    doctor-patient relationship,&quot; said Killian.<br>
    <br>
    The initiative allows patients with specific terminal or debilitating illnesses to use
    limited amounts of medical marijuana, and permits physicians to authorize and recommend
    such use. Qualifying terminal or debilitating illnesses are limited to cancer, human
    immunodeficiency virus (HIV), multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, glaucoma and some forms of
    intractable pain. Patients would be required to have valid documentation authorizing the
    use from a state-accredited physician.<br>
    <br>
    I-692 in no way impacts existing state law prohibiting the use of marijuana for
    non-medical purposes.<br>
    <br>
    Initiative 692 is modeled after senate bill 6271, which was introduced to the legislature
    during the 1998 session by State Senators Jeanne Kohl and Pat Thibadeau. That effort
    received editorial support from the Seattle Times and Post-Intelligencer. &quot;I
    enthusiastically support I-692,&quot; states Senator Kohl. &quot;My dearest friend of 23
    years died recently of uterine cancer. I saw the difference just a small amount of medical
    marijuana made in relieving her suffering, she should not have had to die a
    criminal.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I-692 is about taking care of those who are in greatest need in a responsible
    way,&quot; concluded Killian. &quot;Washington voters are compassionate and fair-minded.
    We're confident they'll agree that this narrowly focused initiative is the right thing to
    do.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Killian will submit the signatures at 1:00 p.m. today in the Office of the Secretary
    of State at the Capital Building in Olympia. He will be available immediately following to
    answer any questions from the media.<p align="center">###</td>
