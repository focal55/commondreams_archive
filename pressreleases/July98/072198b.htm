    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES - July 21 - In response to continued news reports
    that California-based UNOCAL is going ahead with plans to build a gas pipeline through
    Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has virtually imprisoned women and girls in their
    homes, the Feminist Majority led protests outside UNOCAL offices in Washington, DC and Los
    Angeles. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;We are here today to demand that UNOCAL cease all business dealings with the
    oppressive Taliban regime until women&#146;s and girls&#146; full human rights have been
    restored,&#148; said Eleanor Smeal, President of the Feminist Majority. &#147;The Taliban
    have banished women from almost all life activities -- work, school, and even the simple
    act of going outside alone. This horrific gender apartheid must be stopped.&#148; <br>
    <br>
    &#147;If UNOCAL were to proceed, it will be doing nothing less than providing hundreds of
    millions of dollars in royalties to keep a brutal regime going -- funding the continued
    oppression of women,&#148; said Kathy Spillar, Feminist Majority National Coordinator. <br>
    <br>
    UNOCAL is the major partner of the CENTGAS consortium negotiating with the Taliban to
    build the pipeline. Other members of the consortium include Saudi Arabia&#146;s Delta, and
    companies in Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Pakistan. In May, for the first time, the full
    CENTGAS consortium met with the Taliban in Afghanistan. In addition, the Taliban recently
    joined together with their major opposition group in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance,
    and CENTGAS to create a joint economic coalition which would help spur the construction of
    the gas pipeline. The cost of the pipeline has been estimated at two billion dollars. The
    Taliban regime stands to earn up to $150 million annually from the proposed pipeline. <br>
    <br>
    Since the Taliban seized control of the Afghan capital, Kabul, in September of 1996, women
    and girls have been confined to darkened homes (windows must be painted opaque) and not
    allowed outside unless enveloped in a &#147;burqa&#148; from head to toe, with only a mesh
    opening to see through -- and even then only when accompanied by their husband, father, or
    son. Girls cannot go to school -- not even elementary school or home schools -- and women
    are barred from the workplace and from college. <br>
    <br>
    Until two years ago women in Kabul were 50% of the university students, 70% of the
    teachers, and 40% of the doctors. <br>
    <br>
    Girls at the state orphanage in Kabul have not been allowed outside since September of
    1996, although the boys go outside every day to play. Women have been stoned, beaten, and
    shot for disobeying these prohibitions. <br>
    <br>
    The Feminist Majority leads a Stop Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan campaign which is
    supported by over 100 women&#146;s, human rights, and Muslim groups, including: Feminist
    Majority, National Organization for Women, YWCA of the USA, Planned Parenthood Federation
    of America, North American Council of Muslim Women, Muslim Women's League, Women's
    Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, Afghan Women's Association, National
    Council of Women's Organizations, American Nurse's Association, American Medical Women's
    Association, National Political Congress of Black Women, and National Women's Political
    Caucus. <p align="center">###</p>

    Los Angeles -- <br>
    <br>
    WHO: Shareholders, women&#146;s rights groups, and human rights groups protest at UNOCAL
    annual shareholder&#146;s meeting. <br>
    <br>
    WHAT: Women&#146;s rights and human rights groups will protest outside of California-based
    UNOCAL&#146;s annual shareholders meeting while concerned shareholders confront UNOCAL
    board members and officers inside about the company&#146;s business partnership with the
    Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic militia in Afghanistan, that has imposed a brutal state
    of gender apartheid in which women and girls have been stripped of their most basic human
    rights since they came into power. <br>
    <br>
    WHEN: 9:30 - 10:30 AM, Monday, June 1, 1998<br>
    WHERE: 376 Valencia Ave. in Brea, CA @ the corner of Imperial Hwy. and Valencia<br>
    Ave. <br>
    <br>
    UNOCAL is part of a consortium that has entered into a contract with the Taliban to build
    a multi-billion dollar oil and gas pipeline across Afghanistan. Already under pressure,
    UNOCAL&#146;s company web page states, &#147;UNOCAL will not conduct business with any
    party in Afghanistan until peace is achieved and a government recognized by international
    lending agencies is in place.&#148; Yet, the press has reported that a delegation of top
    Taliban officials met with UNOCAL in Texas in December 1997 to discuss the building of the
    pipeline. Also, the University of Nebraska at Omaha says it has a contract with UNOCAL for
    nearly $1 million to train workers in Afghanistan specifically for pipeline construction.
    The training is now underway. <br>
    <br>
    In 1996, the Taliban instituted a regime of gender apartheid which has stripped women and
    girls of their basic human rights. Under Taliban rule women are forbidden to work outside
    the home, forced to wear the burqa - a garment which completely shrouds the body under
    thick layers of fabric, they can not leave the confines of their homes unless accompanied
    by a close male relative, male doctors are not allowed to examine them, they are forbidden
    to wear white socks, and their shoes can not make noise when they walk. Girls and women
    are prohibited from attending schools and universities. Many women and girls have been
    stoned and shot for violations of the Taliban&#146;s edicts. </td>
