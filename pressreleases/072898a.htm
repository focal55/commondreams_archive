    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 28 - Taxpayers for Common Sense Action (TCS Action)
    today introduced the most informative, interactive and user-friendly tool for the American
    taxpayer -- the first-ever Common Sense Taxpayer Scorecard. The scorecard is located on
    the Web at www.taxpayer.net and is also available in traditional paper format.<br>
    <br>
    The Common Sense Taxpayer Scorecard found that, despite dozens of chances to save taxpayer
    money, 359 Members of Congress had a voting average of less than 50 percent during the
    First Session of the 105th Congress. The taxpayer scorecard also identified 25 Taxpayer
    Heroes - 2 senators and 23 representatives who cast pro-taxpayer votes at least 75 percent
    of the time.<br>
    <br>
    Other findings include the best and worst of state delegations. Head and shoulders above
    other states was the delegation from Wisconsin. Its two senators were the only two
    Taxpayer Heroes in that body. Other taxpayer-friendly state delegations include
    Massachusetts and Vermont with a high 72 percent House average. At the other end of the
    spectrum, Alaska's congressional delegation scored lowest in both the Senate and the
    House, joined by Utah and New Mexico.<br>
    <br>
    Ralph DeGennaro, TCS Action's executive director, assessed the taxpayer scorecard results:
    &quot;We found that most Members voted against sensible reforms that would cut waste. It
    is clear that America's taxpayers need more heroes in Congress!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The taxpayer scorecard tallied votes on amendments and bills, 32 votes in the U.S. Senate
    and 36 in the U.S. House, to cut wasteful government spending, subsidies, and tax breaks.
    The votes included spending for items such as the B-2 bomber, Medicare reform, ethanol
    subsidies and pork barrel transportation spending. The Common Sense Taxpayer Scorecard
    scores every Member of Congress and provides full descriptions of the issues considered
    during each vote.<br>
    <br>
    DeGennaro concluded, &quot;The Common Sense Taxpayer Scorecard reaches out to taxpayers
    from all political perspectives and seeks to transcend ideological and partisan
    differences. By empowering citizens with the facts, the taxpayer scorecard allows every
    American to fight for common sense reforms.&quot;<br>

    TCS Action is a 501(c)(4) lobbying affiliate of the non-partisan, politically independent
    budget watchdog organization in Washington, D.C.<p align="center">-0-<font size="3"> </font></td>
