        NIGERIA
        - February 23 -
On the eve of Nigeria's presidential elections, multinational oil companies 
investing in the Niger Delta are failing to respond adequately to serious human 
rights abuse in that region, Human Rights Watch charged in a report released 
today. </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In its eight months in office, the government of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar 
has released many political prisoners and relaxed some restrictions on freedom 
of expression and assembly. But the 200-page <A 
href="http://www.hrw.org/hrw/reports/1999/nigeria/index.htm">Human Rights Watch report</A> 
documents how Nigerian security forces are using brutal methods to suppress 
dissent in the Niger Delta.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#800000">&quot;The oil companies can't pretend they don't know what's happening all 
around them,</font>&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, 
an international monitoring group based in New York. <font color="#800000"> &quot;The Nigerian 
government obviously has the primary responsibility to stop human rights abuse. 
But the oil companies are directly benefiting from these crude attempts to 
suppress dissent, and that means they have a duty to try and stop it.&quot;</font> Roth 
noted that recent events in the Niger Delta, especially the crackdown on Ijaw 
communities over the New Year's weekend, indicate that the Nigerian government 
is continuing to use violence to protect the interests of international oil 
companies.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In one particularly serious incident on January 4, soldiers using a Chevron 
helicopter and Chevron boats attacked villagers in two small communities in 
Delta State, Opia and Ikenyan, killing at least four people and burning most of 
the villages to the ground. More than fifty people are still missing. Chevron 
has alleged to a committee of survivors of the attack that this was a 
&quot;counterattack&quot; resulting from a confrontation between local youths 
and soldiers posted to a Chevron drilling rig. Community members deny that any 
such confrontation took place. In any event, the soldiers' response was clearly 
disproportionate and excessive.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Whoever wins this presidential election will have to cope with growing 
violence in the Niger Delta,&quot; said Roth. &quot;The oil companies and the 
new government should commit to taking a new approach in the region, one that is 
based on zero tolerance for human rights abuse by the police and military.&quot;</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Roth noted that the presidential campaign has included little serious debate 
over events in the Niger Delta and the role of the oil companies in human rights 
abuse there.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the report, Human Rights Watch describes numerous other incidents in which 
the Nigerian security forces have beaten, detained, or even killed people who 
were involved in protests over oil company activities and individuals who have 
called for compensation for environmental damage. Victims include youths, women, 
children, and traditional leaders. In some cases, the abuse occurs after oil 
companies have requested that security forces intervene.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report charges that multinational oil companies are complicit in abuses 
committed by the Nigerian military and police because they fail to condemn them 
publicly and to intervene with the Nigerian government to help ensure that they 
do not recur. In many cases, Human Rights Watch found that the oil companies had 
made no effort to learn what was done in their name by abusive local security 
forces seeking to keep oil flowing in the face of local objections.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch strongly criticized the oil companies for excessive 
secrecy, and called upon them to make public their security agreements with 
state entities. It urged the companies to insist on screening all security staff 
assigned to protect company property, to investigate violent incidents, and to 
publish the results of those investigations. The companies were urged to take 
all necessary steps to ensure that their legitimate need to safeguard their 
facilities and personnel does not result in abuses against members of the 
communities where they operate.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Much of the protest against oil companies' activity in Nigeria has surrounded 
issues such as environmental pollution and corruption, which lie outside the 
mandate of Human Rights Watch. But the need to respect civil and political 
rights, such as freedom of expression and association, fall squarely within the 
international human rights treaties that Nigeria has signed, such as the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa, pumping more than two million 
barrels a day. This oil is produced by multinational oil companies operating in 
joint ventures with the Nigerian government. The Dutch-British corporation Royal 
Dutch/Shell accounts for nearly half of this production and has faced the 
strongest criticism of its corporate behavior. Perhaps for that reason, Shell 
responded most fully to questions from Human Rights Watch about its policies and 
practices and about specific incidents of human rights abuses connected with its 
operations. The U.S.-based oil corporations Chevron and Mobil also answered some 
questions, while France's Elf Aquitaine and Italy's Agip provided almost no 
information at all. None of the oil companies responded to requests to provide 
details of security arrangements with the Nigerian government.</font></P>
