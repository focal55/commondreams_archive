        - February 18 - </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumer advocate Ralph Nader and other consumer and environmental advocates on 
Thursday charged Virginia lawmakers with selling out the interests of consumers 
in exchange for hefty contributions from the state’s electric utilities, which 
would be deregulated under legislation poised for final passage in the House of 
Delegates.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On Thursday, Nader joined Public Citizen’s Critical Mass Energy Project, the 
Sierra Club of Virginia and Virginia Consumer Action in protesting the influence 
of Virginia Power in the deregulation debate.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Virginia Power says this legislation is competition. We say they've 
fixed the game,&quot; Nader said. &quot;This legislation is a consumer rip-off. 
Virginia's lawmakers who are voting for SB 1269 should be ashamed that they are 
putting their need to raise money before the interests of consumers.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Large corporate interests are buying and selling public policy 
decisions in Virginia because the campaign finance laws are so lax.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Rep. Kenneth Plum, chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party, and Sen. Thomas
Norment, Floor Leader of the Republican Party, the groups charged, are being 
influenced by utility campaign contributions in their support of SB 1269, a bill 
that radically rewrites Virginia's laws governing electric utilities.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Republican lawmakers accepted $390,000 from Virginia Power and its parent 
company, Dominion Resources, while Democratic lawmakers raked in $192,000 from 
the electric company during the 1997 and 1999 election cycles. Electricity 
generators contributed $1,127,400 from 1997 to 1999, with $706,200 going to 
Republicans and $421,200 being contributed to Democrats. Both parties are 
raising large amounts of money for their war chests to be used in their struggle 
for control of the Virginia General Assembly.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Virginia Power, which controls 80 percent of the electricity market in the 
state, has had a hand in shaping SB 1269 in a way that leaves them as the bill's 
greatest beneficiary. The legislation, for instance, has no provisions to wrest 
this market share away from the state's largest utility. As a result of a 
special provision, which will provide reimbursement for the uneconomic 
investments of utilities -- euphemistically called &quot;stranded costs&quot; -- 
Virginia Power will walk away with a windfall conservatively estimated to be $2 
billion.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The stranded cost bailout associated with SB 1269 was negotiated in a 
last-minute, secret meeting that included utilities and the large industrial 
customers who will get special price discounts if this bill passes,&quot; said 
Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen’s Critical Mass Energy Project. 
&quot;No consumer groups or public interest advocates were invited to this 
negotiating marathon, even though it will be consumers who pay the price for 
this back-room insider deal-making.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Bruce Parker, Energy Chair of the Sierra Club-Virginia Chapter, said that 
because of the campaign dollars at stake the debate over the electric utility 
bill has been a sham. &quot;At the General Assembly there is a ‘don’t ask, don’t 
tell’ policy governing the debate on this bill,&quot; Parker said. &quot;Members 
of the General Assembly have not asked the hard questions about SB 1269, and 
Virginia Power and the other utilities are sure not telling members about dirty 
air emissions and higher costs for consumers.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Donal Day, a representative of Virginia Consumer Action, agrees. 
&quot;Rushing a deregulation bill through the General Assembly during its short 
session, before most Virginians are even aware of the debate is foolish,&quot; 
Day said. &quot;Virginia is a relatively low-cost state, and we should be 
waiting to see what happens to residential and small business consumers in 
high-cost states that have already passed legislation.&quot;</font></P>
