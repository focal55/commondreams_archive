      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">SAN FRANCISCO
      - February 17 -
Two women who climbed up and hung banners from flagpoles outside of Chevron's 
headquarters this morning were arrested, along with two safety coordinators who 
had been stationed on the ground. The banners read &quot;No Nigerian Blood for 
Oil&quot; and &quot;Human Rights before Drilling Rights;&quot; they were part of 
an international protest against Chevron's role in the deadly repression of 
protestors in Nigeria. The climbers Shannon Wright and Genevieve Raymond, both 
of San Francisco, were arrested and charged with felony mischief, trespassing 
and conspiracy; also arrested were Jon Sellers and Jia Ching Chen, both of 
Berkeley. <BR><BR>The climbers came down from the flagpoles of their own 
volition after Chevron officials agreed to the protestors' demand to set a 
meeting with executives to discuss suspension of operations in Nigeria. 
<BR><BR>On January 4th the villages of Opia and Ikiyan in Nigeria's Ijawland 
were razed by soldiers in retaliation for the Ijaw peoples non-violent protests 
against the oil industry for polluting their lands. There have been 4 confirmed 
dead and there are 67 presumed dead. Chevron PR spokesman Fred Gorrell admitted 
that Chevron's boats and helicopters may have been used in the attack but 
claimed they had no control over their facilities there.<BR><BR>&quot;It is 
completely unacceptable for Chevron to operate behind a military shield&quot; 
said Danny Kennedy, Director of Project Underground and spokesperson at the 
demonstration. &quot;Since May last year we have had Chevron admit to 
facilitating the murder of nonviolent demonstrators, first on the offshore 
Parabe platform in Ilaje and now we have evidence that they did it again in Opia 
and Ikiyan. It is time for them to step back from behind the barrel of a gun and 
make peace with the communities from whose land they make their 
profits.&quot;<BR><BR>The protest at Chevron HQ followed a day of similar civil 
disobedience starting in Nigeria with rallies in both the Niger Delta and Lagos; 
in London against Shell and Washington DC against Mobil, two other companies 
also heavily invested in Nigeria. In the morning, Nigerian time, a mourning 
procession was held in the village of Opia for Kekedu Lawuru and Timi Okaro, the 
two confirmed dead. Banners and placards were held by Ijaw participants reading: 
&quot;Do People Kill For Oil? Chevron Did in Opia and Ikiyan.&quot;<BR><BR>On 
two separate occasions in the last month, a coalition of human rights groups in 
the Bay Area, including Global Exchange, Communities for a Better Environment, 
the International Forum on Globalization and the organizers of today's protest, 
have asked for a meeting with Chevron executives and held demonstrations at 
their headquarters. Last week U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Cleveland) called for 
a Congressional Inquiry into the role of US corporations in ongoing violence in 
the Niger Delta. </font><center>
