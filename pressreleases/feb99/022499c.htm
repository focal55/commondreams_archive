        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 24 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">James and Sarah Brady today joined Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), John Chafee 
(R-RI), Charles Schumer (D-NY), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), 
Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), Jack Reed (D-RI), and Representative John Conyers Jr. 
(D-MI), at the Capitol to announce the introduction of legislation to 
permanently reinstate the Brady Waiting Period on gun purchases.  Legislation 
will also be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. John Porter 
(R-IL).  Also joining Mr. and Mrs. Brady and the lawmakers were representatives 
from law enforcement and Chris Sleater, a victim of gun violence from Salt Lake 
City, Utah, whose wife Anne was shot and killed at her office in January.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The five-day waiting period for handgun purchasers 
required by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Law, expired on 
November 30, 1998.  It has been replaced by a National Instant Check System (NICS), which relies on computerized federal data to immediately check 
prospective firearms purchasers for felony convictions and other barriers to 
purchase. NICS does not include some state and local police records, such as 
records of persons convicted of certain offenses, like stalking, and does not 
include outstanding misdemeanor warrants on domestic violence or records of 
involuntary commitments to mental hospitals. What’s more, without a mandatory 
waiting period, local police departments do not have time to contribute 
information to the background check, and gun purchasers considering crimes of 
passion or impulse suicides will no longer have a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period 
to protect themselves or their victims.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A brief waiting period allows tempers to 
cool and can give our law enforcement officials an opportunity to stop 
questionable purchasers,&quot; said Senator Dick Durbin, the leading cosponsor 
of the legislation in the Senate to restore the Brady Waiting Period.  
&quot;It’s hard to understand why a person would need a gun immediately.  
Bringing back the waiting period isn’t about more government, it’s about fewer 
gun crime victims.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The impact of the expiration of the Brady Waiting 
Period has already impacted the Sleater family: Anne was the victim of a 
disturbed woman who had never owned a gun but was able to purchase one in less 
than an hour and use it in a shooting spree 24 hours later.  The woman had a 
history of mental illness;  a waiting period might have altered her state of 
mind, alerted her family to her dangerous intentions, and/or permitted local 
police to determine that her mental health status would have precluded her 
purchase of a gun.  Without the &quot;cooling-off’ period, individuals 
contemplating suicide have easier access to firearms when they are most 
vulnerable, angry family members have the immediate opportunity to buy a gun 
before their tempers have cooled, and the mentally-ill who have violent 
intentions have legally acquired firearms without a thorough background 
check.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> &quot;A waiting period is not just a waiting 
period. It’s a matter of life and death,&quot; said Jim Brady, the former press 
secretary to President Ronald Reagan and long-time gun violence prevention 
advocate.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We need to protect other Anne Sleaters from 
the disturbed, distressed or angry people who could use lethal firearms to act 
on their impulses,&quot; said Sarah Brady, chair of Handgun Control, Inc.   
&quot;This Congress, which begins its work in the aftermath of a solemn and 
saddening process, has a special challenge to come together to serve the public 
safety of the American people.  I call on that Congress to make the same 
sensible decision it made more than five years ago.  Restore the waiting period, 
and restore the peace of mind that we all deserve.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the implementation of the Brady Law in 
February 1994, almost a quarter-million prohibited purchasers have been stopped 
from buying handguns in gun stores, according to the U.S. Department of 
Justice.  Additionally, a 1997 study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence 
demonstrated that states that began conducting background checks on purchasers 
when the Brady Act was implemented in 1994 are as much as 86% less likely to be 
sources of guns used in crimes in other states than they were to when the checks 
were performed.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">February 28, 1999 marks the five-year anniversary 
of the passage of the Brady Law.  The law, first introduced in 1987, took seven 
years to pass Congress.  The sunset provisions eliminating the waiting period 
after five years in favor of the Instant Check were contained in a successful 
amendment sponsored by the National Rifle Association (NRA).  The amendment’s 
passge allowed the NRA to claim victory to its membership and to the public - 
despite the fact that approximately 90% of American strongly support a waiting 
period for firearms.</font> </P>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I commend Senator Durbin, 
Congressman John Porter and the rest of our friends in the Congress for 
introducing this important legislation,&quot; Mrs. Brady said.  &quot;To allow 
this nation to return to cash-and-carry tragedies is 
unimaginable.&quot;</font></P>

<P><I><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah 
Brady, is the nation’s largest citizens’ gun control lobbying organization. 
Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns.  Founded in 1974, HCI has 
more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the 
country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws.</font></I> </P></td>
