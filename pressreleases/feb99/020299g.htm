      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 2 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">On January 26, the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) motion for preliminary 
injunction against the Justice Department’s implementation of the National 
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was denied in United States 
District Court.  Holding that that the NRA had not &quot;demonstrated a 
reasonable likelihood of success on the merits,&quot; Judge James Robertson 
denied the NRA’s request that the Justice Department be forced to destroy NICS 
records immediately once a gun sale had been approved.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On November 30, 1998, the day that NICS went into 
operation, the NRA filed a suit against the Justice Department for retaining 
NICS records for up to six months (NRA v. Reno).  The Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), which operates NICS, had announced it intended to keep the 
records for up to six months in order to make sure the system was working 
properly.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The NRA sought a preliminary injunction which 
would have forced the government to destroy a NICS record as soon as a 
prospective gun sale was approved.  They claimed that the retention of records 
constitutes &quot;registration&quot; of gun owners and violates the law.  Judge 
Robertson disagreed, saying that the NRA had not &quot;demonstrated a reasonable 
likelihood of success on the merits,&quot; nor had it shown that the 
government’s policy caused a hardship that outweighed the cost to the government 
of dismantling its system.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">An injunction against the retention of records 
would have forced a shutdown of NICS and the temporary cessation of background 
checks on handgun purchasers.   NICS is a fully-integrated system that is 
designed to work in tandem with other automated databases and to provide support 
for a broad range of law-enforcement 
objectives, including fingerprint identification.  Redesigning the software in 
order to comply with an order to destroy records immediately would have taken an 
estimated four to six months to accomplish.  During that time, all federal 
background checks on handgun purchases would have been suspended and criminals 
would have been able to walk into any gun store in 22 states and buy a handgun, 
confident that no background check would be conducted.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, the destruction of records 
requirement would have imperiled the long-term success of the system.  Without 
the ability to retain records, the FBI would have been unable to monitor the 
performance of the system from a technical aspect (e.g. determining whether 
criminals are using false identification to pass the name-based check) as well 
as to make sure that the system is not being used for unauthorized background 
checks.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Justice Department spent much time and 
money putting NICS into place,&quot; said Bob Walker, President of Handgun 
Control, Inc.  &quot;It has a responsibility to the American taxpayer to make 
sure that the system is functioning properly.  The NRA’s paranoid claims of gun 
registration are ludicrous.   Retaining the records for six months is not only 
in the interest of fiscal responsibility but also in the interest of public 
safety.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ironically, by filing their suit, the NRA is 
seeking to further undermine the very system for which they lobbied five years 
ago.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During the debate over the Brady Bill, the 
original proposal mandated a waiting period and background check for all handgun 
purchasers.  Unable to block passage of the legislation in the face of a tidal 
wave of public support, the NRA’s allies in Congress were able to amend the 
legislation to require a  mandatory &quot;sunset&quot; of the waiting period in 
five years, to be replaced by a computerized national instant check 
system.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">However, even before NICS went into operation, the 
NRA began a campaign to subvert the system.  In October, their allies in 
Congress, led by Senator Robert Smith (R-NH), prohibited the FBI from charging a 
nominal user fee for each NICS transaction.  Resorting to a cynical scare 
tactic, the NRA called the fee a &quot;gun tax,&quot; where in reality, the 
minimal fee was no different than fees for drivers’ licenses, car registration 
and hunting licenses.  The fees would have been used to maintain the NICS 
system, but now will have to be absorbed by American taxpayers, whether they own 
guns or not.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">With its lawsuit unlikely to succeed, the NRA is 
now calling on Congress to force the FBI to destroy NICS records 
immediately.</font> </P>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;From its very conception, the 
national ‘instant check’ system has been the gun lobby’s baby, the NRA’s 
alternative to a 5-day waiting period and a background check by state and local 
officials,&quot; said Mr. Walker.  &quot;First, the gun lobby prevented the FBI 
from charging a nominal fee for the background checks -- in effect, defunding 
the system.  And now, by attempting to require the immediate destruction of NICS 
records, the NRA is trying to prevent the FBI from ensuring the system even 
works properly.  One has to wonder about the NRA’s commitment to public safety 
when it is trying to smother its own creation in its crib.&quot;</font> </P>

<P><I><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah 
Brady, is the nation’s largest citizens’ gun control lobbying organization. 
Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns.  Founded in 1974, HCI has 
more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the 
country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws.</font></I></P></td>
