        - February 4 - </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
I am proud to join today with national women's leaders and leading women members 
of Congress to urge the United States Senate to put an end to this spectacle of 
hypocrisy and travesty of justice. The 13 House managers want to subject Monica 
Lewinsky and the American public to live testimony on the floor of the Senate. 
This woman has been forced to offer the same testimony, and the same facts 23 
times. Enough is Enough.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The house managers are showing their true Religious Right colors. In this 
last ditch attempt to save face, they have once again demonstrated by their 
statements and actions that they are out of touch with the American people - 
especially American women.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As leaders in the national women's rights movement, we have known for some 
time just how out of touch these Republican House managers are-- and now, at 
last, so will the nation. Their blatant disregard for public opinion in this 
matter is no surprise. Time and time again, Henry Hyde and the other managers 
have ignored the public's overwhelmingly pro-women's rights and pro-choice 
views, and now they are ignoring the public once again. It is interesting to 
note that even during this impeachment trial several House managers, including 
Henry Hyde, have spoken of their opposition to abortion. The out-of-touch 
behavior of the 13 House managers in this impeachment trial has done more to 
reveal the dominance of the Religious Right in the Republican Party than the 
thousands of anti-choice and anti-women's rights votes cast by Congressmen such 
as Henry Hyde, and his band of twelve.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Feminist leaders spoke early and often in opposition to the impeachment of 
the President. And today we have a message for the managers -- it seems they 
need reminding. The American people, especially women, are not with you. We do 
not want this trial to continue. It is time to GIVE IT UP.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Note: Feminist Majority President, Eleanor Smeal joined other national 
women's rights leaders and women members of the US Congress today to oppose live 
witness testimony in the Senate Impeachment trial of President Clinton. Smeal 
was joined by Patricia Ireland, President of the National Organization for 
Women; Dr. Yvonne Scruggs Leftwich, Executive Director, Black Leadership Forum; 
Dorothy Height, President Emeritus, National Council of Negro Women; Dr. Ramona 
H. Edelin, President, National Urban Coalition and interim Executive Director of 
the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation; Lina Frescas Dobbs, Executive 
Director, Wider Opportunities for Women; Dr. Martha Burk, Center for the 
Advancement of Public Policy</font>
