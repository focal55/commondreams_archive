        A broad range of citizen organizations expressed support for the principles 
of the Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 initiative to be 
introduced today by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The initiative provides guaranteed annual funding from the Land &amp;
Water Conservation Fund -- at the level envisioned when the fund was authorized several decades ago -- and other long-sought measures to
protect America's public lands, wildlife, and historical resources.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Implementation of Permanent Protection for America's Resources
2000 
would be a dream come true for conservationists,&quot; said Defenders of 
Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen, speaking at the Capitol Hill press 
conference today. Selected comments submitted by environmental leaders 
follow:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This far-sighted legislation is Defenders of Wildlife's top
legislative priority because it provides long-needed permanent protection for the Land and Water Conservation Fund as well as
funding 
for endangered species recovery, restoration of public lands, ocean fish and 
wildlife, and native wildlife and plant programs.&quot; <BR>-- Rodger
Schlickeisen, president, Defenders of Wildlife</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Millions of acres within our national parks are still privately
owned and not protected because the federal government has failed to acquire the lands America wants preserved. Resources 2000 will
provide 
the funding, not only this year, but in years to come, to secure these 
treasured places for the ages.&quot; <BR>-- Tom Kiernan, president, National 
Parks &amp; Conservation Association <BR> </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Citizens in communities all across the country voted last fall
for 
over a hundred ballot and bond initiatives to protect America's special 
places. Now it's time for our lawmakers to catch up with the American 
people. The Congress should act quickly to pass this popular bill.&quot;<br>
-- 
Carl Pope, executive director, Sierra Club</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Sen. Boxer and Rep. Miller have outlined an inspired vision for
protecting and restoring the irreplaceable elements of our heritage for 
the future. This bill shows that we can find ways to protect all our 
resources, including the ocean and its creatures, without the danger of 
incentives for unnecessary offshore oil drilling. We applaud their effort 
and look forward to working with them to ensure the vitality of our ocean 
and coastal resources for our children.&quot; <BR>-- David Younkman, executive 
director, American Oceans Campaign</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Resources 2000 is a bold, comprehensive approach to conservation.
The legislation directs money where it is desperately needed: to purchase land for bird and wildlife habitat, to help endangered
species 
recover, and to fight sprawl. Congressman Miller and Senator Boxer are to be 
commended for charting the course of conservation for the next century. By 
providing permanent protection, our children will be able to enjoy the 
splendors of our land and wildlife.&quot; <BR>-- Dan Beard, vice president for 
Public Policy, National Audubon Society</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Working to protect special landscapes in our national parks,
forests, and refuges, and in communities across the country, we have witnessed firsthand the pressing need for reliable federal
conservation 
funding -- and the losses that occur without that federal support. The Trust 
for Public Land is gratified by the well-woven fabric of resource-protecting 
programs contained in this bill, and we look forward to enactment of these 
vital provisions.&quot; <BR>-- Will Rogers, president, Trust for Public Land</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The National Wildlife Federation's top priority for this Congress
is passage of significant long-term funding for wildlife and wild places 
for both federal and state programs. This proposal helps set the parameters 
to achieve a bipartisan victory for conservation funding this year.&quot; 
<BR>-- Mark Van Putten, president &amp; CEO, National Wildlife Federation</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Now that we have successfully moved past the Cold War and large
budget deficits, it is essential that we Americans invest in the stewardship of our natural resources and the sustainability of our
environment for the benefit of our children and their children. Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 is a bold
initiative 
to protect our precious natural and cultural heritage and the quality of 
life for all Americans. As we approach the millennium we must pass this 
program as our generation's legacy for the future.&quot; <BR>-- John Adams, 
president, Natural Resources Defense Council </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Resources 2000 
provides long-overdue funding for bipartisan conservation initiatives which 
will help Americans protect natural beauty, the character of their 
communities, and their heritage as we move into the new millennium.&quot;<br>

Meg Maguire, executive director/president, Scenic America</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A healthy ecosystem is the bedrock of a healthy society. The
Miller/Boxer bills will help to preserve the biodiversity we need for the development of new medicines and vaccines, and safeguard the
parks 
and recreation areas so vital to human health and well-being. PSR is pleased 
to add its voice to the chorus of support for this important 
legislation.&quot;<br>
-- Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., executive director, Physicians 
for Social Responsibility</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We applaud Rep. Miller and Sen. Boxer for their effort to
reinvigorate chronically under funded land acquisition programs and provide much-needed funds to protect urban areas and open spaces and
conserve fish and wildlife. Resources 2000 will provide a substantial down payment in the effort to preserve and protect our natural
heritage 
while protecting our coastal areas from increased offshore drilling.&quot;<br>
-- Gene Karpinski, executive director, U.S. PIRG</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;America's Resources 2000 would significantly help our lands,
oceans, and creatures in the next millennium. Rep. Miller and Sen. Boxer 
have listened to the demand of the American people and are pushing for 
critical, much-needed funding for the environment.&quot; <BR>-- Brent
Blackwelder, president, Friends of the Earth</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is vital that Congress adequately fund the programs that care
for the public's lands, whether in parks, national forests, wildlife preserves, or historic sites. Without adequate funding, federal
stewardship of the public's lands will fall further and further behind, 
and America's natural heritage will be lost to future generations. Congress 
ought to lay down the law: federal lands must be kept safe, even added to, 
instead of treated as a national yard sale for wealthy corporations to raid 
for cheap resources. The Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 
bill sends that message loud and clear.&quot;<br>
-- Philip E. Clapp, president, 
National Environmental Trust</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We welcome Rep. George Miller's proposal that joins with the
Administration's initiative and the previously introduced Senate and House bills, calling for full funding for the Land and Water
Conservation Fund and much-needed support for fish and wildlife to state 
agencies. We are especially encouraged by the expressed commitment of all 
parties to work cooperatively on these proposals with all those who have a 
stake in the nation's natural resources to craft a landmark conservation 
bill in this Congress.&quot;<br>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">STATEMENT OF RODGER SCHLICKEISEN,<br>
PRESIDENT - DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE <BR>February 23, 1999 <BR>Capitol Hill Press 
Conference of Honorable George Miller &amp; Honorable Barbara Boxer</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Good Morning, I'm Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of
Wildlife. I know I speak for many conservationists in thanking Representative Miller and Senator Boxer for the opportunity to be
here 
today and for their outstanding environmental leadership over the years. The 
initiative that they will introduce today -- Permanent Protection for 
America's Resources 2000 -- is bold and visionary.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Just a few weeks ago, President Clinton and Vice President Gore
took an 
historic step in proposing the Lands Legacy Initiative. For the the FY 2000 
budget, for the first time in any Administration, the Clinton Administration 
requested the full annual amount authorized for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF). The Administration proposed more than $1 billion 
in appropriations for the LWCF and related programs to protect species and 
habitat -- including both terrestrial and oceanic resources --and to provide 
recreational opportunities. President Clinton also pledged to work with 
Congress to provide a permanent revenue stream for the Lands Legacy 
Initiative and related programs beginning in FY 2001.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Rep. Miller's and Senator Boxer's far-sighted legislation answers
the 
President's call and expands upon it in some ways. It provides permanent 
funding and it encompasses a land and ocean legacy for the 21st century. 
Defenders of Wildlife wholeheartedly endorses the bill.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In fact, this legislation is our top legislative priority for two
reasons: first, it guarantees the level of permanent annual funding for 
wildlife and wildlife habitat vital to meeting the challenges of the next 
century. Second, it dramatically enhances state efforts to protect a 
diversity of species. Not only does this bill provide for permanent funding 
for the LWCF, it also includes other measures to protect America's public 
lands, help endangered species recover, protect ocean fish and wildlife, and 
boost urban recreation and native wildlife and plant conservation programs.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As former associate director of the Office of Management and
Budget, I 
know that full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been a 
priority for the environmental community for many years. When Congress 
created this landmark program in 1964 and subsequently authorized it at $900 
million in 1978, it made a promise to the American people to reinvest 
royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling into acquisition and permanent 
protection of key land, water, and open-space resources. But Congress made a 
mistake by requiring that the actual spending by the trust fund be subject 
to the annual appropriations process -- with the result that LWCF-funded spending has generally been only a fraction of its authorized level.
Thus the original promise has been broken repeatedly.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Miller-Boxer bill would correct that mistake. The bill would
renew 
the promise made to the American people three decades ago by enabling 
federal agencies to fund a long list of backlogged national wildlife refuge, 
park, and forest land acquisitions and by allowing state and local 
governments to acquire long-needed open space and habitat areas.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Moreover, unlike other legislative proposals, the Miller/Boxer
legislation would not provide incentives for unnecessary offshore oil drilling and would not target funds disproportionately to states with
a 
lot of offshore drilling. Funds would be distributed more equitably to all 
states for a variety of land and ocean conservation programs. Unlike other 
proposals, the Miller and Boxer legislation ensures that wildlife funds 
would be targeted at conservation of all native species and biodiversity. 
Other proposals also contain unacceptable restrictions on federal LWCF 
acquisitions.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Under the bill that will be introduced today, the $900 million
would be 
split evenly between the federal and state portions of LWCF; and more than a 
billion dollars of additional funding would assist ocean fish and wildlife, 
urban parks, historic preservation, restoration of degraded public lands, 
endangered species recovery, nongame wildlife, and forest and farmland 
programs. The funding package totals $2.3 billion.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These programs meet a number of critical needs. As we move into a
time 
when our remaining wildlands and wildlife habitat are threatened by 
ever-expanding sprawl and development, the bill provides a menu of options 
for providing habitat protection.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For example, Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000
will help 
satisfy a need recognized almost 20 years ago when Congress authorized the 
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 (FWCA), but then did not fund it. 
And by funding and amending FWCA, this legislation will give the states 
money to implement the comprehensive conservation planning needed to protect 
all native fish and wildlife and their habitats. This measure could go a 
long way toward preventing future endangerment of species.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to providing LWCF acquisition funds, the Miller and
Boxer 
legislation facilitates purchase of easements to help private landowners 
protect farmland and forest land from development. Moreover, the Endangered 
and Threatened Species Recovery Fund in the legislation creates a dedicated 
source of funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine 
Fisheries Service to use in implementing a private landowner incentive 
program for the recovery of species and their habitats.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Recent reports by Defenders of Wildlife and the National
Biological 
Service have warned that our nation's ecosystems are in serious decline and 
must be conserved before any additional deterioration occurs. In particular, 
the Defenders report identified the 10 states with ecosystems most at risk: 
Florida, California, Hawaii, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, South Carolina, 
Virginia, Alabama, and Tennessee. The Miller-Boxer bills will give these 
states the necessary funding to help arrest and, we hope, someday reverse ecosystem decline.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Miller-Boxer legislation includes substantive measures
long sought by 
conservationists. These measures represent values deeply held by the public. 
As Americans, we strongly identify ourselves with the nation's land and 
wildlife. The purpose of this bill represents nothing less than preserving 
the heart of America's land and wildlife resources and the history and 
culture that arose from our relationship with them.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 reflects a
vision of 
the kind of world that we want to leave to our children. Passage of the bill 
would be a great step toward leaving a rich and diverse natural and cultural 
heritage to future generations.</font>
