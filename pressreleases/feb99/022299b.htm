        - February 22 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Thousands of youth activists across the nation are taking the lead in 
organizing and mobilizing for Equality Begins at Home, a major campaign for gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) equality. From a march against hate 
violence in Georgia to a youth-led conference in Oregon, young people are 
organizing to bring their issues and their voices to the forefront in the 
struggle for equality. Equality Begins at Home will take place from March 21 - 
27 and is the first-ever coordinated political campaign of actions in all 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for gay, lesbian, bisexual, 
and transgender equality. Issues affecting youth will be one of the major themes 
for the week of political actions. Equality Begins at Home is coordinated by the 
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and organized by the Federation of Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Statewide Political Organizations.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Youth involvement in Equality Begins at Home isn't only benefiting the 
young activists. Equality Begins at Home is giving adult activists the 
opportunity to work with youth who have been honing their organizing skills 
since they were 13. Adult activists are quickly learning that youth can do more 
than stuff envelopes. These young activists aren't the leaders of our movement 
tomorrow, they have already been leading the movement,&quot; stated Rea Carey, 
executive director of the National Youth Advocacy Coalition (NYAC). NYAC is 
supporting Equality Begins at Home through organizing workshops for youth and 
working with Federation groups to increase youth involvement in Equality Begins 
at Home.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Young people often bear the brunt of homophobia in our country. While 
they are more exposed to violence and harassment in their schools, in their 
homes and in the streets, they are also the least protected. We need look no 
further than the brutal attack this month against Adam Colton,&quot; said Kerry
Lobel, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force executive director. Anti-gay 
attackers targeted Colton, a 17-year-old student at San Marin High School in 
Novato, California, for the second time in six months. Last week Colton was 
beaten unconscious and the word &quot;fag&quot; was carved into his flesh with a 
pen. In September, Colton's car was vandalized, and he was attacked.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Youth events for Equality Begins at Home include rallies,
speakouts, and 
conferences addressing the issue of safe schools, hate crimes, coming out, and 
more. In addition, in many states youth are an integral part of the overall 
Equality Begins at Home organizing. In Tennessee, 22-year-old Brandon 
Hutchinson, a student at East Tennessee State University, is organizing a 
caravan of young people from rural eastern Tennessee to Nashville to participate 
in an Equality Begins at Home lobby day. The Tzabaco Company provided funding 
for Hutchinson's efforts through a $2000 Equality Begins at Home organizing 
grant.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Like Hutchinson, many of the youth activists involved in Equality Begins at 
Home are graduates of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's Youth Leadership 
Institute. Started in 1995, the Youth Leadership Institute is an annual 
week-long intensive skills-building training for youth activists. In Wisconsin, 
19-year-old Malaka Sanders, also a graduate of NGLTF's Youth Leadership 
Institute, is revitalizing a GLBT coalition of African-American activists by 
organizing a town meeting. In North Carolina, NGLTF Youth Leadership Institute 
graduates are working in coalition with local anti-racist and economic justice 
youth organizations to organize a youth speakout at the state capitol. 
&quot;Equality Begins at Home is an opportunity for young people to see 
themselves as assets and agents of change within our community,&quot; said youth 
activist John Harrison of the North Carolina Lambda Youth Network.</font>
