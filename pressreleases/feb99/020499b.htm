        - February 4 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The execution of Sean Sellers shames the USA and is a further sign of its 
selective contempt for the international human rights standards it so often 
claims to support, Amnesty International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean Sellers was executed by lethal injection in Oklahoma State Penitentiary 
just after midnight on 4 February, for crimes committed when he was a 
16-year-old boy.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">International law prohibits the use of the death penalty against those under 
18 at the time of the crimes. It is a principle that is now so widely accepted 
that no country is exempt from it.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The USA's repeated claims that it is the most progressive force for 
human rights in the world are contradicted by its blatant flouting of the global 
moral and legal consensus that killing people for their childhood crimes is 
wrong,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;By executing Sean Sellers, the US authorities have turned their clock 
back 40 years to the last time a US prisoner was put to death for a crime 
committed at 16. This cannot be defined as a progressive act.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Organization of American States, the UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, Defense for Children International, the American Bar Association, and 
Amnesty International were among those who appealed for the execution to be 
stopped.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 27 January, the day the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board rejected Sean 
Sellers plea for clemency, Pope John Paul II challenged the USA to reject the 
cruelty of the death penalty. However, Oklahoma's Governor, a Catholic, welcomed 
the clemency rejection. In television interviews on 3 February he said that the 
Pope was &quot;wrong&quot; about the death penalty.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In the end, international law and the global moral consensus was 
ignored to satisfy perceived domestic opinion,&quot; Amnesty International 
continued.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In doing so the authorities have done nothing but deepen the culture of 
violence in US society. It is time to seek constructive solutions to violent 
crimes, including those committed by children.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The execution of Sean Sellers has confirmed the USA as the world's leading 
perpetrator of the execution of people under 18 at the time of the crime. It has 
now executed 10 child offenders since 1990, one more than the rest of the world 
combined. The nine others killed in the USA were 17 at the time of the crime.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The USA has now carried out the last four executions of child offenders known 
in the world, having put three such prisoners to death in 1998. Only five other 
countries are known to have carried out such executions since 1990.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean Sellers was the 512th prisoner executed in the USA since it resumed 
executions in 1977. In the past six years an average of one prisoner a week has 
been put to death. So far in 1999 the pace has increased to nearly three 
executions a week. Twelve people have already been killed this year, and at 
least another 11 are currently facing execution in February.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Against the worldwide trend towards abolition of the 
death penalty, the USA is not only increasing its own resort to judicial 
executions but has also contributed to recent retrograde steps on capital 
punishment in other countries.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Philippines is due to execute its first prisoner in more than two decades 
tomorrow, 5 February. In 1997 officials from the Philippines were reported to 
have visited US execution chambers as part of their research into adopting 
lethal injection as an execution method.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Similarly, in Guatemala, the lethal injection chamber was imported after a 
government delegation visited the USA in 1997 to learn about executions by 
lethal injection. As of February 1999, there are some 35 people awaiting 
execution on Guatemala's death row.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 29 January 1999, the Attorneys General of 12 countries of the 
English-speaking Caribbean signed a statement in Trinidad advising their 
governments to withdraw from the Inter-American Human Rights Convention and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, then to re-affirm all 
parts except those dealing with the death penalty.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This decision follows a meeting in early 1998 between the Attorney General of 
Trinidad and Tobago and the US Attorney General. Among the topics discussed was 
the problem Trinidad was having in executing prisoners as quickly as it would 
like. The US Attorney General reportedly pledged her country's support in giving 
any assistance Trinidad required in implementing the death penalty.</font></P>
