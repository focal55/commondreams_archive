        FRANCISCO
        - February 24 -
Findings from a just-released public opinion poll indicate that nearly 
two-thirds of Americans believe it is wrong to sell or purchase products made 
out of old growth forest wood. Nearly three out of five believe that old growth 
logging should be banned outright, and forty-four percent say they would be less 
likely to patronize a company if they learned that company uses or sells old 
growth products. <BR><BR>The poll was conducted for Rainforest Action Network 
(RAN) by Yankelovich Partners, one of the nation's most respected polling 
organizations. Yankelovich Partners regularly conducts public opinion polls for 
Time Magazine and CNN.<BR><BR>Of those surveyed, 62.5 percent gave a resounding 
&quot;no&quot; to the question: &quot;Should companies today use or sell 
products made from old growth wood?&quot; Baby Boomers and Generation X-ers were 
most likely to say they opposed use and sales of old growth wood, with responses 
dropping off somewhat in people over fifty. Twenty-six percent of people saw no 
problem with cutting down ancient trees, while 11.5 percent were not sure. 
&quot;Old growth forests&quot; were defined as forests where no logging has ever 
taken place. <BR><BR>&quot;These polling results confirm what we've long 
suspected,&quot; said Michael Brune, RAN's Old Growth Campaign director: 
&quot;The American people believe it's simply wrong to cut down old growth 
trees.&quot; <BR><BR>Additional questions asked whether old growth logging 
should be banned, and whether folks would be more or less likely to patronize a 
business that uses or sells old growth wood. Nearly three in five (58.5 percent) 
think that laws should put an end to old growth logging, with 33.7 percent 
opposed and 7.8 percent unsure. People feel so strongly about old growth forests 
that many said it would effect their purchasing habits: 43.5 percent said they 
would be less likely to do commerce with a business they knew used old growth 
wood; 41.8 said they would not be effected, while 4.3 percent were not 
sure.<BR><BR>&quot;If I were a Home Depot executive I'd be pretty concerned if I 
thought that 43.5 percent of my business were going to walk away,&quot; RAN's 
Brune said. Home Depot is the largest retailer of old growth wood products. RAN 
has asked Home Depot to start phasing out these products, and has staged 
high-profile demonstrations at company headquarters in Atlanta and at grand 
openings of stores across the country.<BR><BR>&quot;Home Depot is lagging 
behind,&quot; Brune added. &quot;Many large, visionary companies and leaders in 
the home improvement industry have already started to eliminate old growth wood 
products.&quot; Europe's largest home improvement center, B&amp;Q, has nearly 
completed removing old growth wood from its shelves. In December 1998, 27 U.S. 
corporations-including IBM, Dell, Kinko's, Nike, 3M, Levi-Strauss and 
others-announced their commitment to stop using old growth wood. <BR><BR>Only 
about four per cent of the United State's original ancient forests are still 
standing. Worldwide, logging and other causes of deforestation have brought all 
but twenty per cent to the brink of extinction. Home Depot sells cedar, fir and 
spruce lumber and wood products cut from the heart of the coastal rainforest of 
British Columbia; lumber, decking and trim from the Pacific Northwest's ancient 
redwoods; mahogany doors from the tropical rainforests of the Amazon; and lauan 
and ramin plywood, paneling, tool handles and dowels from southeast Asia at 
their 700-plus stores in North America </font>
