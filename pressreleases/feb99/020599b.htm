Reformers Call On Speaker Hastert To Schedule Early House Action On Bipartisan 
Campaign Finance Reform</font></b></td>

        - February 5 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
Reform supporters today called on Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) to 
schedule House consideration of the Shays-Meehan bipartisan campaign finance 
reform legislation under fair procedures in order to complete final action on 
the bill by this spring.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The call came in the wake of a press report in which Speaker Hastert revealed 
he has no plans for early House action on campaign finance reform. The Speaker's 
comments put him at odds with a solid majority in the House in favor of 
bipartisan campaign finance reform, according to Common Cause. That majority has 
increased since the 1998 elections.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the January 31 Chicago Sun-Times, Speaker Hastert indicated his 
intention to put campaign finance reform on the legislative back burner, with 
Social Security, health care, and tax and spending matters receiving attention 
first. &quot;You've got to do first things first,&quot; Hastert said. None of 
the issues Hastert cited, however, are expected to be ready for action on the 
House floor for months, as The Washington Post pointed out in an editorial 
today, whereas the Shays-Meehan legislation is ready for floor action now. 
&quot;Delaying action until later this year only serves to run out the clock in 
the Senate, and to ensure that the current corrupt campaign finance system will 
continue unabated,&quot; McBride wrote. &quot;If that is the case, a deluge of 
unregulated and undisclosed money will flood the 2000 elections and make the 
scandals in 1996 and 1998 look like child's play.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaker Hastert has stated that any campaign finance reform must have 
bipartisan support and be fair to both Democrats and Republicans. Reformers note 
that the Shays-Meehan legislation meets both of these tests. According to Common 
Cause:</font>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Shays-Meehan has strong bipartisan support. Shays-Meehan passed the House 
six months ago on a bipartisan vote of 252-179, with fully one-fourth of the 
House Republican Conference voting favor. And, 20 freshman House Members signed 
the Common Cause Public Integrity Pledge to vote for legislation with a real 
soft money ban like the one found in Shays-Meehan. Among them are Representative 
Jim DeMint (R-SC), president of the Republican freshman class and Representative 
Brian Baird (D-WA), president of the Democratic freshman class.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Shays-Meehan is fair to both parties. At the heart of the bill is a ban on 
soft money - the unregulated and unlimited contributions to both of the 
political parties from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals. By 
banning the soft money raised by both parties, nothing in Shays-Meehan favors 
Democrats over Republicans or vice versa.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Shays-Meehan helps ensure that important policy decisions are not unduly 
influenced by huge special interest contributions. Big soft money contributors 
are often able to win tax breaks, subsidies and other benefits from the federal 
government. In fact, many large soft money donors have a stake in major 
legislative efforts, including the priorities Speaker Hastert has identified 
such as Social Security reform, health care reform and tax policy.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Shays-Meehan addresses a problem the American people want solved. Nine out 
of 10 Americans want fundamental change in the campaign finance system, 
according to a New York Times poll. While Shays-Meehan does not attempt to be 
comprehensive, it is the essential first step toward reviving public confidence 
in Congress and fighting the dangerous cynicism that undermines our democracy.</font></UL>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Shays-Meehan directly addresses the scandals of recent campaigns. Virtually 
all of the scandals of the 1996 elections - from the White House coffees, 
foreign contributions, Lincoln Bedroom overnights, or party campaign ads 
masquerading as issue ads - are soft money scandals. By banning soft money, 
Shays-Meehan effectively addresses these scandals.</font></LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The American people don't want more obstruction, more study, or more 
excuses,&quot; McBride wrote. &quot;They want bipartisan action now. The 
Shays-Meehan bill is not only bipartisan, it is strong, fair, effective and 
urgently needed.&quot;</font> </P>
