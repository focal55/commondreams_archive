        - February 25 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">As we approach the new millennium, there are growing signs that the world may 
be on the edge of an environmental revolution comparable to the political 
revolution that swept Eastern Europe, reports Lester Brown, president of the 
Worldwatch Institute, in an article in the <A 
href="http://www.worldwatch.org/mag/1999/99-2.html">March/April issue of World 
Watch. </A>
        </font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The social revolution in Eastern Europe led to a restructuring of the 
region's political systems. This global revolution could lead to an 
environmentally driven restructuring of the global economy.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Not all environmentalists will agree with me,&quot; said author Lester 
Brown, &quot;but I believe that there are now some clear signs that the world is 
in the early stages of a major shift in environmental consciousness. What is not 
clear to me is whether we will cross this threshold in time to avoid the 
disruption of global economic progress.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Across a spectrum of activities, places, and institutions, the atmosphere has 
changed markedly in just the last two years. The CEOs of some prominent 
corporations are now beginning to sound like spokespeople for Greenpeace. Some 
political leaders are adopting policies long championed by ecologists. And 
literally thousands of environmental NGOs have sprung up around the world, 
mobilizing millions of people for change.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For many who track environmental trends, such as collapsing fisheries, 
shrinking forests, rising temperatures, and the wholesale loss of plant and 
animal species, it has been clear for some time that economic progress can be 
sustained only if the economy is restructured so that its natural support 
systems can be protected.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For those not already convinced of the need to replace the Western, 
fossil-fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economy with an economy that 
would be environmentally sustainable, what is happening as China modernizes 
offers compelling new evidence. For example, a car in every garage in China, 
American style, would not only deprive China of scarce cropland, but would also 
drive China's oil consumption to some 80 million barrels a day, well above the 
current world production of 67 million barrels per day.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;If the western industrial development model will not work for China, it 
will not work for India, whose population will reach 1 billion later this year, 
or for the other 2 billion people in the developing world,&quot; said Brown. 
&quot;And in an integrated global economy, it will not work over the long term 
for the industrial countries either.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Brown argues that there is an exciting alternative economic model that 
promises a better life everywhere without destroying the earth's natural support 
systems. The new economy will be powered not by fossil fuels, but by various 
sources of solar energy and hydrogen. Urban transportation systems will be 
centered not around the car, but around high-tech light rail systems augmented 
by bicycles and walking. Instead of a throwaway economy, we will have a 
reuse/recycle economy.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Twenty years ago when we first outlined this new model at the 
Institute, it was seen as pie-in-the-sky,&quot; said Brown. &quot;Now that view 
is changing both because it is becoming clear that the old model won't work and 
also because we can see the broad outline of the environmentally sustainable 
economic model emerging.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Nowhere is the new model more visible than in the energy sector. While oil 
and coal use have expanded by just over 1 percent a year since 1990, the use of 
solar cells has expanded by 16 percent per year and wind power by a prodigious 
annual rate of 26 percent. Wind power already supplies 8 percent of Denmark's 
electricity and 15 percent of the electricity for Schleswig-Holstein, the 
northernmost state of Germany. In Spain's northern state of Navarra, it has gone 
from 0 to 23 percent in just three years. Worldwide, the wind power potential is 
several times that of hydropower, which now supplies just over one fifth of the 
world's electricity. A new Japanese solar roofing material promises to 
revolutionize the electrical generating industry. In Germany, the 100,000 roofs 
program launched in December of 1998 by the new coalition government is leading 
to a joint investment by Shell Oil/Pilkington in a solar cell manufacturing 
facility that will be the world's largest.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The more enterprising corporate CEOs are beginning to see this economic 
restructuring as the greatest investment opportunity in history. In a speech on 
February 9, Mike R. Bowlin, Chairman and CEO of ARCO, a major oil company, 
described the beginning of &quot;the last days of the age of oil&quot; and the 
emergence of the new hydrogen-based energy economy. He sees ARCO's large 
holdings of natural gas playing a key role in the transition from a carbon-based 
energy economy to one based on hydrogen. Within the last two years, British 
Petroleum has committed $1 billion to the development of wind and solar energy 
and Royal Dutch Shell has announced a $500 million investment in renewable 
energy sources.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Governments, too, are changing. Denmark has banned the construction of 
coal-fired power plants. Costa Rica plans to get all its electricity from 
renewable sources by 2010. In mid-August 1998, after several weeks of 
near-record flooding in the Yangtze River basin, Premier Zhu Rongji ordered a 
halt to tree cutting in the upper basin, arguing that trees standing are worth 
three times as much as those cut.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If we are indeed approaching a social threshold on the environment that could 
lead to a rapid restructuring of the economy, will it come soon enough? Is it 
too late to save the Aral Sea? Yes, its fish are gone. Is it too late to save 
Indonesia's rain forests? Probably. Is it too late to avoid global warming? 
Apparently. The Earth's average temperature now appears to be rising. Can we 
ameliorate future temperature rises? Yes. Can we move fast enough to prevent 
environmental deterioration from disrupting the global economy? Probably. But 
only if we cross the threshold soon.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No challenge in the new century looms greater than that of transforming 
the economy into one that is environmentally sustainable,&quot; said Brown. 
&quot;This Environmental Revolution is comparable in scale to the Agricultural 
Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. The big difference is in the time 
available. The Agricultural Revolution was spread over thousands of years. The 
Industrial Revolution has been underway for two centuries. The Environmental 
Revolution, if it succeeds, will be compressed into a few decades.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Brown writes that archeologists have uncovered the sites of earlier 
civilizations that moved onto economic paths that were environmentally 
destructive and could not make the needed course corrections either because they 
did not understand what was happening or could not summon the needed political 
will.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We do know what is happening,&quot; said Brown. &quot;The question for 
us is whether our global society can cross the social threshold that will enable 
us to restructure the global economy before environmental deterioration leads to 
economic decline.&quot;</font> </P>
