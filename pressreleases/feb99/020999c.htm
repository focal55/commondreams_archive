        - February 9 - </font>Today the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will release
        a 
report which finds that nearly half of all poor working parents lacked 
health insurance coverage throughout 1997. The study, which features 
state-by-state data, determines that working poor parents are twice as 
likely to be uninsured as poor parents who are unemployed.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report, &quot;Employed but Uninsured: A State-by-State Analysis of
the Number of Low-Income Working Parents Who Lack Health Insurance,&quot; also finds that few states have yet to take advantage of a new option
the welfare law created that allows states to extend Medicaid coverage 
to low-income parents. The report notes, however, that a number of states 
are beginning to consider this option.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The findings of the report, which is based on Census data and
provides 
data for the first time on the number and percentage of low-income working 
parents in each state who lack insurance, include the following:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Forty-six percent of the 4.9 million working parents with
income below 
the federal poverty line -- $13,650 for a family of three -- were uninsured 
in 1997.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- More than one of every three parents with incomes below 200
percent of 
the poverty line ($27,300 for a family of three) -- or 34.5 percent of such 
parents -- lacked insurance in 1997.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to changes in welfare programs and a robust economy, fewer
low-income 
parents are now receiving welfare and the Medicaid coverage that typically 
comes with it. As a result, more of these parents are working at low-wage 
jobs that offer no health insurance coverage and have joined the ranks of 
the uninsured.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">State Medicaid Programs Not Filling the Gap</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report finds that most states, including Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, 
Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia 
are not filling these gaps by offering coverage to low-income working 
parents through Medicaid. Although most states provide coverage to poor and 
near-poor children in low-income working families, their parents remain 
without insurance.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, some 21 states fail to extend Medicaid coverage to
most 
parents in two-parent households. According to the report, rules in these 
states that largely limit coverage to parents in single-parent households 
stem from an old, and now widely discredited, policy left over from the old 
welfare system.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">New Option Allows States to Close Gaps</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Under the new Federal law, states now have the option to expand
Medicaid 
to low-income working parents. The study finds that some states still seem 
unaware of this new option. The federal government will finance half to more 
than three-fourths of the cost of extending health insurance coverage 
through Medicaid to low-income working parents, with the exact percentage of 
the federal government's share depending on each state's Medicaid matching 
rate. Thereby allowing states to promote work and meet their welfare reform 
goals.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In recent months several states, including the District of
Columbia, 
Rhode Island, Missouri, and Wisconsin, have taken advantage of the new 
option to expand coverage for low-income working parents, the report said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This report will be available on an embargoed basis through
<A 
href="http://www.cbpp.org">http://www.cbpp.org</A> on Monday, Feb. 8, 1999.
