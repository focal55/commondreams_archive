        - February 16 - </font>Stand For Children announced today that &quot;Ready to Learn, Ready to 
Succeed&quot; will be the platform for the fourth annual Stand For Children 
Day. Over one million people nationwide are expected to take part in over 
1,500 Stand For Children Day events on and around June 1 as part of the growing grassroots movement working to improve children's education
        in 
and out of the classroom. At Stand For Children Day events people will be 
calling for immediate action to solve the education crisis in America which 
threatens to leave millions of children unprepared for the demands of the 
21st century.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The &quot;Ready to Learn, Ready to Succeed&quot; platform means that in
addition to caring and supportive parents, every child must have:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Health coverage. Children who can't see the blackboard, can't
hear the 
teacher, or are distracted by pain can't learn to the best of their ability. 
Stand Day events will help children succeed by signing children up for 
health insurance under the new Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Substantial new investments for affordable, quality child care.
Young 
children need proper care and nurturance, stimulation, and early education 
to enter school ready to read and to succeed.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Safe, productive after-school activities. Enriching
after-school 
programs can help the nearly five million young people who are home alone in 
the afternoon each week stay out of trouble, and also give them the extra 
boost they need to succeed in school -- and in life.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Schools that challenge all children. With small classes,
skilled 
teachers, high standards, and involved parents, every child can perform at 
high levels. The supports and expectations, both in and out of school, can 
help all children succeed.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Until every child goes to school ready to learn and ready to
succeed, America's promise will never be realized. Each of us must make 
a commitment now to work in our community to put the education needs of 
children first,&quot; says Stand For Children executive director Jonah Edelman.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Across the country Stand For Children Day events will raise
awareness 
about the urgent need for a holistic plan to get every child ready to learn, 
ready to succeed and push for federal legislative solutions such as 
expansion of the 21st Century Learning School Fund, new funding for school 
construction, and new investments in the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG). In local
communities, Stand For Children Day events will make 
direct improvements in the lives of children through renovation and construction of playgrounds, book drives, rallies, and children's
resource fairs.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Stand For Children Day '99: Ready to Learn, Ready to Succeed will
also 
join people from all over the world via a &quot;Cyber-Stand For Children&quot; on the World Wide Web. &quot;Cyber-Stand For Children&quot; 
will take place in conjunction with local Stand For Children Day events on 
the Stand For Children Website at <A 
href="http://www.stand.org">www.stand.org</A>.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">More than 200,000 visitors are expected to visit the web site to
learn 
about how they can help ensure all children are ready to learn in the 
classroom and ready to succeed in life. Visitors will be encouraged to sign 
the Stand For Children pledge and send Cyber-Postcards to their elected 
officials encouraging them to stand up for legislation to support children 
and families. Last year 150,000 people participated in Cyber-Stand For 
Children, 1,000 of whom sent emails to their Members of Congress.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1996, the first Stand For Children Day drew more than 300,000
people 
to the Lincoln Memorial in the largest demonstration of commitment to 
children in U.S. history. In 1997, more than 700 local Stand For Children 
Day events focused on the health issues of children, and encouraged 
legislators to pass the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which will 
provide health insurance to more than 5 million children. In 1998, more than 
1,200 events nationwide, focused national attention on issues related to 
child care, and helped pass the Kerry/Bond amendment, the strongest vote for 
child care in over a decade.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Volunteers interested in participating in or planning a Stand
For Children Day '99 event should call 1-800-663-4032, visit the web site at 
<A href="http://www.stand.org">www.stand.org</A>, or via email at <a href="mailto:tellstand@stand.org">tellstand@stand.org</a>
. Stand For Children will provide technical support and 
assistance and link organizers and their events to millions of people
nationwide.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Stand For Children is a nonprofit, nonpartisan national membership
organization organizing a powerful citizen voice to give all children the opportunity to grow up healthy, educated, and safe. Stand For
Children is an affiliate of the Children's Defense Fund with more than 
100 Stand For Children Chapters which have completed or are undertaking 
hundreds of initiatives for children.</font>
