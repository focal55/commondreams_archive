        - February 24 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">As Senate hearings on the Independent Counsel Act commence, Public Citizen 
today released a new analysis of the law and recommendations for Congressional 
action. Hearings on the Act, which is due to expire June 30, begin today in the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Public Citizen played a role in the legislative debate that led to passage of 
the Independent Counsel Act in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and now 
recommends that the Act should not be reauthorized without significant reforms. 
Alternatively, the consumer and government watchdog group suggests, Congress 
could establish a special prosecutor within the Department of Justice who would 
not be subordinate to the Attorney General or President.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is essential that Congress maintain a strong and fair process for 
investigating allegations of criminal conduct by high-level government 
officials,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;It must not 
sweep this capacity aside because of the unpopularity of Ken Starr or the 
Independent Counsel Act. The Congress must strike a balance in the law between 
independence and accountability.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Public Citizen’s analysis -- <A href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/ica.htm"><EM>The 
Independent Counsel Act: What Congress Should Consider in 1999 </EM></A>-- is 
written by David Vladeck and Alan Morrison. Vladeck is director of the Public 
Citizen Litigation Group and is a visiting professor of law at Georgetown 
University Law Center. Morrison is the founder of the Public Citizen Litigation 
Group and was principal counsel for Ralph Nader and the three members of 
Congress in <I>Nader vs. Bork</I>, which held that the firing of Watergate 
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox by President Richard Nixon was illegal.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Public Citizen makes the following major recommendations for strengthening 
both the independence and the accountability of the Independent Counsel:</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Mandating significant prior experience in criminal law, disqualifying 
persons clearly identified with a political party through recent elected or 
appointed positions, assuring truly Independent Counsel by prohibiting 
concurrent representation of private clients in matters involving the United 
States, and requiring full-time Counsel when the president or vice president may 
be a target of the investigation;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Limiting partisan influence in the Special Division, the three-judge panel 
that appoints the Counsel, by providing for the random selection of 
pre-qualified judges rather than designation by the chief justice, three-year 
term limits, and a limit of two (out of three) judges from the same political 
party;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Raising the threshold for referrals of cases to the Independent Counsel by 
allowing a broader preliminary investigation by the attorney general (including 
use of subpoenas), giving state officials the initial option of proceeding 
against violators of state law, eliminating coverage of former federal 
officials, and requiring that requests for referrals of subsequent matters -- 
the way Ken Starr’s inquiry journeyed from Whitewater to billing at the Rose law 
firm to Lewinsky -- be governed by the same standards, and arise from the same 
set of facts, as the original referral; and</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">4) Encouraging reasonable limits on the time and money available to the 
Independent Counsel by mandating Court approval of a preliminary schedule and 
budget and subsequent revisions.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Should Congress decide to allow the Independent Counsel Act to lapse, Public 
Citizen recommends that it take the following steps to help &quot;ensure that 
the Justice Department prosecutors assigned to investigate allegations of 
wrongdoing by high-level officials are sufficiently insulated from political 
pressure&quot;:</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Creation of a new office or use of an existing unit within the Justice 
Department whose head would be appointed by the president with the advice and 
consent of the Senate for a term of years exceeding the president’s term (e.g. 
five or seven years) and removable only for &quot;good cause&quot; personally by 
the attorney general. Senior executive branch officials would be prevented from 
having contact with prosecutors in this office when an investigation was 
pending. All allegations of crimes by covered officials would be referred 
directly to the office, which would have its own budget line to protect it from 
executive pressure. It would also be empowered to seek immediate judicial review 
of executive privilege claims and forward matters regarding impeachment directly 
to Congress;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Alternatively, Congress could continue to sanction the Justice 
Department’s use of ad hoc outside Special Prosecutors operating under Justice 
Department rules but include statutory protections to ensure the prosecutors 
cannot be removed without &quot;good cause&quot; and are safeguarded from 
interference by executive branch personnel.</font></P>
