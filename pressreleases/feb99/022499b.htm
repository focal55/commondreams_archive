        copayment; blasts plan for making low-income seniors "pay for Congress' mistake"</b></font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - February 24 - </font>
        America's home health care recipients - many of them low-income seniors - could be forced to make a 10 percent copayment for home
        health care visits under a proposal being considered by the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-VT) warned
        today, and he has organized the fight in Congress against the plan.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"It is outrageous to keep asking people who can barely make ends meet to pay
for home health care after Congress created this mess by cutting $115 billion from Medicare - $16 billion from home health care - to pay for tax
cuts for millionaires and billionaires in the 1997 balanced budget legislation, which I opposed," Sanders said.  "Congress has rejected smaller
copayments in recent years.  Now they're talking about 10 percent.   This has got to stop.   Congress needs to act quickly to repair the damage done
two years ago.   We must stop coming up with plans that force the frailest, sickest, low-income people in our country to pay for Congress' mistake."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sanders, who led the fight in Congress against an $8 copayment proposal last
year, is leading the opposition against the 10 percent proposal.   He has organized bipartisan support from other House Members and has drafted a
letter to Medicare Commission co-chairs Sen. John Breaux (D-LA) and Rep. Bill Thomas (R-CA), arguing against the copayment and urging its rejection
by the Commission.   The letter has more than 45 Members' signatures, and Sanders expects to get more.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">There is currently no copayment requirement for Medicare beneficiaries who
receive home health care.   Sanders pointed out that many home health care recipients are frail, elderly and often living on incomes of less than
$10,000 a year.   They are already having trouble paying for food, housing, heat and prescription medicines they need, he said, and a 10 percent
copayment would be devastating. Sanders said that, according to the Health Care Financing Administration,
the average per-beneficiary reimbursement for home health care was $4,704 in 1997, the year for which most recent figures are available.   A 10 percent
copayment, therefore, would require the average Medicare beneficiary to pay $470 per year for home health care services.
Home health care providers would also be hurt by the copayment plan.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the National Association for Home Care, nearly 20 percent of
America's home health agencies have closed since the passage of the 1997 balanced budget legislation.   Other agencies have been forced to reduce
services to people needing care. NAHC, the nation's leading national home health care organization, strongly backs Sanders' efforts.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"If any copayment is adopted by the Medicare Commission, we are concerned
that many of the sickest and frailest seniors will go without the care they need.  We fully support Congressman Sanders' efforts to stop this outrageous
copayment proposal," said NAHC President Val Halamandaris.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Many home health care agencies have indicated that, if a copayment is
required, they will be forced to cover the additional costs themselves, rather than passing them along to patients.  That means an additional
financial drain on agencies that are already cutting back.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Congress has already caused great hardship for some of the poorest,
sickest, most vulnerable Americans," Sander said.  "This is cruel; this is unnecessary; and it has got to be changed.   Our seniors deserve the care
they need, and neither they nor our home health care providers should be hit with higher costs that translate into reduced services.   The answer is for
Congress to get its priorities straight and fix this problem and not impose additional burdens on seniors and providers."</font></P>
