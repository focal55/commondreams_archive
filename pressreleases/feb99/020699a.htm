        - February 6 - </font>Sarah Brady, the chair of Handgun Control Inc., today offered her strong 
support for an administration proposal that would require a background check 
in connection with the purchase of any gun at a gun show.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The President in his weekly radio address announced the release of
a 
report on gun shows that was prepared by the Justice Department and the 
Department of the Treasury. In addition to regulating the sale of guns at 
gun shows, the report recommended further study on large volume sales of 
guns by unlicensed dealers operating out of their homes or over the 
Internet.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Brady Law,&quot; Mrs. Brady said, &quot;was a huge step forward. 
It's done an excellent job of stopping criminals from buying guns at a gun store. But it's not enough. Today's proposal is the next logical
step. 
It takes dead aim at very deadly problem: the unregulated sale of guns by 
unlicensed dealers who call themselves 'private collectors' at gun 
shows.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Gun shows themselves,&quot; Mrs. Brady emphasized, &quot;are not the
problem, it's the unregulated and illegal gun sales that take place at 
gun shows. The Administration's report makes it clear that gun shows have 
become a ready source of guns for the illegal markets.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Last year, Handgun Control Inc. released a special report entitled
&quot;The Dirty Dozen of Gun Shows&quot; that identified the most notorious users and abusers of gun shows, including prominent cop-killers,
domestic terrorists, gun-traffickers, cultists, and serial killers. Mrs. 
Brady said, &quot;Gun shows, unfortunately, have become a giant flea market 
for criminals and those who want to hide their criminal intent.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Mrs. Brady also urged the Administration to look seriously at the
sale of 
guns over the Internet. &quot;Too many unlicensed gun dealers are using the 
Internet. It's a small but growing market for guns. At this stage, the gun 
show loophole is a much bigger problem, but in the long run we will need to 
take a closer look at the Internet 'auction' houses. The truth is, we just 
don't know how many guns are being sold to illegal purchasers through the 
Internet.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I strongly commend the President, the Attorney General and the
Secretary of the Treasury,&quot; Mrs. Brady said, &quot;for their leadership 
on this issue. This administration has done more than any other administration in history to keep guns out of the hands of convicted
felons and other illegal buyers.&quot; <BR>------ <BR>Handgun Control Inc., 
chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's largest citizens' gun control 
lobbying organization. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works to enact 
stronger federal, state and local gun control laws, but does not seek to ban 
handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and 
works with local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable 
gun control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on
its Website at <A
