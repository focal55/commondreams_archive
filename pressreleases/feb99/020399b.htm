        - February 3 - </font>Acting in a groundbreaking case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, a 
Maryland jury has awarded a state trooper $375,000 for emotional damages in the 
first-ever sex discrimination verdict in conjunction with the federal Family and 
Medical Leave Act.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The ACLU of Maryland and the ACLU National Women's Rights Project sued the 
Maryland State Police in 1995 on Trooper 1st Class Kevin Knussman's behalf, 
saying that the 22-year police veteran was denied parental leave to care for his 
newborn daughter because of his gender. The ACLU argued that the Maryland police 
violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and 
the medical leave act.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We are thrilled for the Knussman family and very proud of our 
client,&quot; said Deborah A. Jeon, managing attorney with the ACLU of Maryland. 
&quot;State Trooper Kevin Knussman truly showed himself to be one of 'Maryland's 
finest' by standing up for the Constitution through a long and difficult legal 
fight.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In anticipation of the birth of his first child,
Knussman, now 41, originally 
sought leave in 1994 under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which 
guarantees employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave upon birth of a child. When his 
request was denied and his wife became ill, Knussman again sought family leave 
under a Maryland law that provides for 30 days of paid leave to state employees 
who are &quot;primary care providers&quot; for a newborn or adopted child.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">But the Maryland State Police denied both his requests, saying that only 
women were eligible for leave under the law. In court papers, the ACLU said a 
female personnel supervisor told Knussman, &quot;God decided only women can give 
birth,&quot; and &quot;unless your wife is in a coma or dead,&quot; and 
&quot;because only women have the capacity to breast feed a baby,&quot; he could 
not be considered the primary care provider.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The ACLU successfully argued that both the federal and state laws are 
gender-neutral and that the state had violated the Equal Protection Clause of 
the U.S. Constitution by denying Knussman primary care-giver status.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This is the first family medical leave case that directly challenged 
the denial of rights to a father,&quot; said Sara Mandelbaum, the ACLU Women's 
Rights Project attorney representing Knussman. &quot;In passing the Family 
Medical Leave Act, Congress sought to encourage men to share in child care 
duties that many working women took on alone. Some male-dominated institutions 
like the Maryland State Police may have a problem with this concept, but the 
court has shown it is the law of the land.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Mandelbaum said that the case reflected a wider problem in the American 
workforce, noting that a large percentage of both men and women are unaware of 
their leave rights as guaranteed under the medical leave act.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While the men who know about their rights are taking advantage of their leave 
opportunities, a recent national survey indicates that more than 40 percent of 
both men and women were unaware of their leave rights under the Family and 
Medical Leave Act. The survey, conducted for the National Partnership for Women 
&amp; Families, also revealed that 30 percent of men and women did not know if 
their spouses were guaranteed leave under the law.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The jury in this case has heeded President Clinton's call to put teeth 
in the Family and Medical Leave Act,&quot; said Robin Cockey, an ACLU volunteer 
attorney who argued the case in 1995 and in the jury trial.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton profiled Knussman's case in her 1995 book, 
It Takes A Village, and Knussman testified before a Congressional Committee on 
Family and Medical Leave in 1995 about his efforts to claim benefits. The 
Knussman family also joined President Clinton on his weekly radio show in 1995 
to celebrate the Act's second anniversary.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I'd like to be able to go back to work and hold my head high and serve 
the citizens of Maryland,&quot; Knussman said upon learning of the jury's 
verdict.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Kevin Knussman was represented by ACLU of Maryland attorney Deborah A.
Jeon, 
volunteer attorney Robin Cockey from Cockey, Brennan and Maloney in Baltimore, 
and by ACLU Women's Rights Project attorney Sara Mandelbaum. The case is 
<I>Knussman v. State of Maryland</I>, No. B-95-1255.</font></P>

<H2 align=center><font size="2" face="Arial">Knussman v. Maryland State Police<BR>ACLU Fact Sheet on Working 
Families and the FMLA</font></H2>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Acting to fight unemployment, neutralize workplace discrimination practices 
that traditionally burdened women, and provide a safety net for families in 
times of need, Congress signed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) into law 
in 1993.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The FMLA is critical to families across America. The number of women working 
outside the home has dramatically increased in recent decades, requiring 
Americans to balance professional obligations with family responsibilities. 
Before 1993, many employers did not provide employees with job security during 
periods of family and medical leave.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">However, while studies reveal that a large number of working Americans need 
to take time off to care for their families at some point in their careers, a 
large percentage of both men and women are unaware of their leave rights under 
the FMLA or erroneously believe that it does not protect them.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Facts:</font></P>
<UL type=CIRCLE>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">FMLA requires all employers with 50 or more employees to provide permanent 
employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid family leave;</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Any qualifying employee must be given leave if the employee gives birth to, 
fathers, adopts or accepts a child into foster care; cares for a seriously ill 
spouse, son daughter, or parent; or develops a serious health condition that 
renders the employee unable to perform his or her job.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">While earlier laws had barred employers from penalizing women either because 
of their gender or from the physical limitations of pregnancy, the FMLA bars 
employers from penalizing workers of either gender who want to take leave to 
spend time with a new child or to care for sick family members.</font> </LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Loopholes:</font></P>
<UL type=CIRCLE>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">While the majority of employers (86.5 percent) know they are covered by the
  FMLA, only 58.2 percent of covered employees have ever heard of the Act, (A 
Workable Balance: Report to Congress on Family and Medical Leave Policies, U.S. 
Department of Labor, April 1996).</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Out of 1,000 people, more than 40 percent of both men and women are unaware 
of their leave rights under the FMLA, (Family Matters: A National Survey of 
Women and Men, National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, February 1998).</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Thirty percent of men and women do not know if their respective spouses are 
guaranteed leave under the law (Family Matters: A National Survey of Women and 
Men, National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, February 1998).</font> </LI></UL></td>
