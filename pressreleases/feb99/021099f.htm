        - February 10 - </font>Passage of the concealed-carry law now before the Colorado state legislature 
would allow tens of thousands of convicted criminals to carry guns in Colorado 
communities, many of whom are likely to commit additional, often violent, crimes 
in the future.  According to data obtained by the Office of Planning and 
Analysis of the Colorado Supreme Court, in just one year, from July 1, 1997 to 
June 30, 1998, there were 57,587 cases filed in Colorado for misdemeanor 
offenses ranging from assault to criminal trespass to theft to simple drug 
possession to fraud.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While not all cases result in convictions, and 
some individuals may have committed more than one offense in that year, the 
numbers are staggering.  Moreover, felony arrests which resulted in misdemeanor 
convictions as a result of a plea bargain are not included in the more than 
57,000 cases cited above.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What Colorado citizens cannot escape,&quot; 
said Sarah Brady, chair of Handgun Control, Inc., &quot;is that this law will 
open the door for thousands of convicted criminals to legally carry handguns in 
cars, in bars and on our streets.  And many, if given the chance, will do just 
that. Federal law does bar possession by some misdemeanants, particularly those 
convicted of domestic violence offenses, but large numbers of convicted 
criminals are still permitted to own guns when they get out of 
jail.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A recent study conducted by the Violence 
Prevention Research Program and published in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association showed that people convicted on misdemeanor charges in California 
were seven and a half times more likely to commit another crime as were gun 
buyers with clean records.  Nearly half of the gun owners with misdemeanor 
records were later arrested for another crime, with one in four charged with 
violent offenses including murder, armed robbery and rape.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Another study conducted in early January by HCI’s 
sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, demonstrated that 
in the five years between 1992 and 1997, there was a much larger decline in the 
crime rate – and in the violent crime rate – in states with strict 
concealed-carry laws compared to states that have relaxed their carry laws. 
Colorado itself experienced a 9.1% drop in its overall crime rate in one year, 
from 1996 to 1997, compared to a national decline of 3.2%.  The state did even 
better with its violent crime rate, which declined 37.3% between 1992 and 1997, 
compared to the national decline of 19.4%.</font> </P>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The proposed legislation would 
ensure that the wrong people can carry the wrong guns in the wrong places,&quot; 
Mrs. Brady said.  &quot;Colorado does not need hidden handguns and the risk of 
more gun violence.&quot;</font> </P>
<P align=center><font size="2" face="Arial"># # #</font> </P>
<P><I><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah 
Brady, is the nation’s largest citizens’ gun control lobbying organization. 
Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns.  Founded in 1974, HCI has 
more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the 
country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws.</font></I> </P></td>
