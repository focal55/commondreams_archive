        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 25 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">On 25 February, the US State Department will publish its annual report on 
human rights, addressing the unjustified killing or ill-treatment of people by 
police and other security forces in some 190 countries -- similar incidents in 
New York, Illinois or California, however, will not be granted a mention</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;One could very well say that this year, like every other, there will be 
50 entries missing from the State Department report: from Alabama to 
Wyoming,&quot; Amnesty International said, deploring the USA's hypocritical 
stance at not recognizing the extent to which human rights abuses are going 
unchecked in its own territory.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The US government has a selective approach to human rights -- using 
international human rights standards as a yardstick by which to judge other 
countries, but consistently failing to apply those same standards at home.&quot;</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Furthermore, US government policies often lead to human rights being 
sacrificed for political, economic and military interests, both in US territory 
and abroad,&quot; the organization continued. &quot;By providing weapons, 
security equipment and training to other countries, the USA is responsible for 
the same abuses it denounces in its State Department report.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Amnesty International, when it comes to human rights, the USA 
discriminates against countries and victims.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The US government often criticizes countries it considers hostile, 
while ignoring abuses committed by its allies or failing to take action that 
would run counter to US interests. When it comes to victims, human rights 
violations committed in US territory are not even admitted as such.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human rights violations in the USA are serious and persistent. Just in the 
past year, Amnesty International recorded regular reports of torture and 
ill-treatment including:<br>
</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">the death of a prisoner after being strapped for hours to a restraint 
board,</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">allegations of immigration detainees being beaten and tortured with 
electro-shock shields while held in four-point restraint, and</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">the use of the 
remote control electro-shock stun belt in trials and prisoner transportation in 
well over 100 jurisdictions -- including Louisiana, where stun belts have been 
used on low security HIV/AIDS inmates.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">In US prisons and jails, physical and sexual abuse are endemic, and 
repressive control methods -- like electro-shock weapons or prolonged use of 
restraint chairs -- are increasingly being used. Inquiries into police brutality 
in some jurisdictions in the last decade -- including Los Angeles, New York and 
Washington DC -- show a pattern of systematic abuses. The US Justice Department 
receives thousands of complaints every year, which many regard as just the tip 
of an iceberg. Those whose rights have been violated often receive financial 
compensation in out of court settlements -- which effectively means the tax 
payer paying for the authorities' right to abuse their power with impunity.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The USA is failing to meet even the minimum international standards regarding 
the use of the death penalty. Also, by executing ever increasing numbers of 
people, the country it is out of step with the international trend towards 
abolition.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">International human rights standards demand the highest legal safeguards for 
all capital trials, seek to restrict the scope of the death penalty, see it as 
unacceptable punishment for the mentally ill, and forbid its use against 
juvenile offenders. Not only does the USA fail on all these counts, but early 
this month, the execution of Sean Sellers for crimes committed when he was a 
16-year-old boy confirmed the USA as the world's leading executioner of child 
offenders.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Use of the death penalty in the USA has consistently shown to be racist and, 
as the authorities attempt to speed up the time between sentence and execution, 
the risk of killing the innocent is constantly increasing.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In terms of the treatment of asylum seekers, people seeking refuge in the USA 
from persecution in their own countries are increasingly locked up in detention 
and effectively treated like criminals.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;While the US State Department report on human rights serves a good 
purpose in reminding the international community of the need to remain vigilant 
about human rights protection, the USA itself should not be immune from 
international scrutiny,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Victims of human rights abuses in the USA have the right not to be 
discriminated against. By failing to take a close look at home, the USA is doing 
just that,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In addition to looking at the state of human rights abroad, it is high 
time for the USA to recognize this situation and put an end to it. &quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International's on-going campaign on human rights in the USA was 
launched in October 1998. As part of the campaign, Amnesty International has 
been calling for the US to adopt and rigorously enforce a binding code of 
conduct, based on human rights, covering all transfers of military, security and 
police equipment, services and expertise.</font> </P>
