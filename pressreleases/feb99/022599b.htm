        - February 25 - </font>
        </p>

<FONT SIZE=2><P><b><font face="Arial">Statement of NOW President Patricia Ireland</font></b></P>

        </FONT>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We will likely never know the truth about Juanita Broaddrick's accusation
against Bill Clinton.  It's virtually impossible to prove or defend against a 21-year-old rape charge. Perhaps the best way to respond is to call on
President Clinton and his supporters not to launch a broadside against his accuser and to urge the president and the Congress to work to improve the
status of women.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Washington Post reports that government investigators "found her
account inconclusive."  Ms. Broaddrick's account, however, is particularly compelling because, like Kathleen Willey, she has been a reluctant witness
with no apparent political or financial motivation.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I understand why she would not want to get involved with the Paula Jones
case and why she would give an affidavit denying what she now says is true.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I understand why a woman wouldn't file charges of rape 21 years
ago--especially against  the attorney general of Arkansas -- especially if she's a married woman who's having an affair.  And I understand why she has
been reluctant to come forward now.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">When I was in law school, I learned that the best rape survivor from the
prosecution's point of view is a woman who is old enough to tell her story, but not old enough to have ever had a smoke, a drink or a date.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ever since the Garden of Eden, in sexual matters, men have been dominant
and women have taken the blame.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ms. Broaddrick says even she blamed herself at the time. After all, she had
invited him up to her room. And she was sure she would not be believed.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Now that she has come forward with her story, the National Organization for
Women urges everyone to treat Juanita Broaddrick fairly and respectfully and to take her charges seriously.  She must not be besieged by attacks on
her mental state or character.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">NOW calls on President Clinton to denounce this "nuts or sluts" defense,
the argument that she either made it up or asked for it.  The president should pledge publicly not to seek, or leak, irrelevant sexual history or
other parts of Ms. Broaddrick's personal or work life, and not  to let anyone do so on his behalf.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As with other charges against Clinton, a phalanx of partisan lawyers,
spokespeople and politicians who are opponents of the women's rights movement are linked to the most recent accusation.  Ms. Broaddrick's story
was unearthed by the attorneys in the Jones suit. When they did not get Ms. Broaddrick's cooperation, Ken Starr pursued her and convinced her to
testify against the president, after giving her immunity on perjury. Ms. Broaddrick was not deposed by the House leadership or managers. Instead,
wavering House members were urged to review the Independent Counsel's still-secret files on the investigation by his office of her accusation.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Unlike most of the voices raised on Ms. Broaddrick's behalf,  NOW has been
working to improve women's rights on the job for more than three decades.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ultra conservatives are using this case to advance their long-standing
political interest in weakening the president, undermining equal opportunity laws and discrediting the movement to strengthen women's rights.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The House managers, with their Johnny-come-lately concern about sexual
harassment, should join us in a campaign to strengthen the laws against it. The unreasonable time limit of only 180 days to file charges must be at
least doubled.  And women ought to be able to collect every penny of damages they prove in sex discrimination cases, without the existing
arbitrary limit on the amount.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Those who are horrified by the reality of rape should work to pass the new
Violence Against Women Act to support survivors of such violence and put more programs in place to prevent it.  We must push to amend the Hate
Crimes Act to cover hate crimes against women.</font></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>

<P><font face="Arial">Traditional opponents of women's rights need to put up or shut up.</font></P>

        </FONT>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If they care about women's rights, then stop wasting time on unprovable
charges and start working to improve the lives of women.  That is what NOW has done and will continue to do.</font></P>
