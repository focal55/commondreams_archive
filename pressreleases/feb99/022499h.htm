      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 24 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The average working family loses more than $4,000 each year because of the wage 
gap between women and men, according to &quot;Equal Pay for Working Families: 
National and State Data on the Pay Gap and Its Costs,&quot; a new study released 
today by the AFL-CIO and the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Overall, 
America's working families lose a staggering $200 billion each year.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The national AFL-CIO also launched a campaign to introduce new equal pay 
legislation in over 22 states this year. The legislation is designed to close 
the wage gap between men and women as well as workers of color.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Equal pay would make a world of difference for working 
families. For many families, it could mean living above the poverty level, 
decent health care, a college education for the kids, and a secure 
retirement,&quot; said Linda Chavez-Thompson, AFL-CIO Executive 
Vice-President.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Heidi Hartmann, President of the Institute for Women's Policy 
Research, working families in Ohio, Michigan, Vermont, Indiana, Illinois, 
Montana, Wisconsin, and Alabama pay the heaviest price for unequal pay to 
working women, losing an average of roughly $5,000 in family income each year. 
Family income losses were calculated taking into account differences such as 
education, age, annual hours worked and geographic location.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Statewide family income losses due to unequal pay for women range from $326 
million in Alaska to $21.8 billion in California.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Over 50 percent of two-earner <EM>and</EM> single mother households across 
the country would be lifted out of poverty if equal pay were enacted and 
enforced at the state level.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The analysis found that both women and men who work in 
&quot;female-dominated&quot; jobs (those in which at least 70% of the workers 
are women) pay a steep price -- a total whopping $113 billion annually. The 26.5 
million women who work in traditionally female-dominated jobs lose $88 billion 
and the four million men working in these jobs lose $25 billion each year.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Looking simply at annual earnings for full-time workers, women are paid the 
least, compared with men, in Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, North 
Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming -- where women earn less than 70 percent of men's 
weekly earnings. Women of color fare especially poorly in Louisiana, Montana, 
Nebraska, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming -- earning less than 
60 percent of what men earn.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The study found that even where women fare best compared with men -- in 
Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island 
-- women earn little more than 80 percent as much as men. Women earn the most in 
comparison to men -- 97 percent -- in Washington, D.C., but the primary reason 
women appear to fare so well is the very low wages of minority men. For women of 
color, the gender pay gap is smallest in the District of Columbia, Hawaii, 
Florida, New York, and Tennessee, where they earn more than 70 percent of what 
men overall in those states earn.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;One of the best ways to help close the wage gap between men and women 
is to join a union,&quot; said Gloria Johnson, President of the Coalition of 
Labor Union Women.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Unions help raise wages for their members. On average, full-time women 
workers represented by unions earn 38 percent more per week -- $157 -- than 
non-union women. Unionized minority women also earn 38 percent more -- $135-- 
than women of color who don't belong to unions. Minority men who are represented 
by unions bring home a hefty 44 percent more -- $177 -- each week than 
non-unionized men of color. Gender and minority wage gaps are smaller, too, 
among unionized workers: women represented by unions earn almost 84 percent as 
much as union men, while unionized workers of color make about 81 percent as 
much as unionized white workers.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Equal pay is one of the key legislative priorities for the AFL-CIO in 1999. 
In addition to working to pass state equal pay bills, the AFL-CIO supports both 
the Fair Pay Act, sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative 
Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-District of Columbia), and the Paycheck Fairness Act, 
sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle (D-South Dakota) and Representative Rosa 
DeLauro (D-Connecticut).</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Over the next two years, we are going to work hard to make sure elected 
officials and candidates hear from working families at the state and federal 
level and take real action on equal pay,&quot; said Karen Nussbaum, Director of 
the AFL-CIO's Working Women's Department.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In September, the AFL-CIO launched a new website <STRONG>[<A 
href="http://www.aflcio.org/women/equalpay.htm">www.aflcio.org/women/equalpay.htm</A>]</STRONG> 
which allows users to find out how much unequal pay costs them over the course 
of their careers. The average 29-year old woman with a college degree will lose 
almost a million dollars throughout her lifetime.</font></P>
