      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 2 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">People For the American Way Foundation and the Milwaukee branch of the NAACP 
today charged in a legal complaint filed with the Wisconsin Superintendent of 
Public Instruction that more than a third of the 88 private voucher schools in 
Milwaukee are or may be violating state law concerning how voucher students must 
be selected for admission.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This troubling new information comes from a comprehensive review of 
&quot;random selection&quot; plan documents filed with Wisconsin's Department of 
Public Instruction (DPI) by the voucher schools themselves. The plans reveal 
that 17 voucher schools are clearly violating the legal requirement that they 
adopt and utilize a random selection process, and that there are serious 
questions DPI should investigate as to whether an additional 18 voucher schools 
are violating the requirement.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of the schools have ignored the requirement that they admit voucher 
students on a nondiscriminatory basis, instead adopting student selection plans 
that explicitly favor parishioners or others. Others have simply ignored the 
requirement, failing to submit to the state any random selection plan at all.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In a detailed letter to Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction John 
Benson, who is charged by law with enforcing the random selection requirement, 
lawyers for PFAWF and the Milwaukee branch of the NAACP describe the ways in 
which many schools are circumventing, flouting or otherwise ignoring the state 
requirement for a random selection plan. The letter asks DPI to withhold any 
further payments to these schools until they bring their procedures into 
compliance with the law.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A key provision of the Wisconsin voucher program requires participating 
private and religious schools to admit voucher students on a truly random basis. 
Nonetheless, a number of schools are granting illegal preferences to students on 
religious, academic or other grounds.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Voucher schools have a moral and legal obligation to comply with the 
law, which means truly random selection of voucher students,&quot; said PFAWF 
General Counsel Elliot Mincberg. &quot;The voucher program was sold to Wisconsin 
legislators and indeed defended before the Wisconsin Supreme Court with the 
promise that all voucher students would get an equal chance to participate 
through random selection, not selection based on religious belief or other 
factors. That promise has been broken.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Here are some examples of Milwaukee schools that are violating the state's 
random selection requirement:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Saint Alexander School's &quot;random selection&quot; plan states that it 
creates a preference for Catholic students. It says: &quot;New students to Saint 
Alexander's will be accepted in the following order: Siblings, Catholic 
Students from Saint Alexander's Parish, Catholic Students from other 
parishes, and then non-Catholic students.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</font></UL> 
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Blessed Sacrament School's &quot;random selection&quot; plan specifically 
provides that &quot;Parishioners are not subject to the random selection 
process.&quot;</font></UL> 
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">St. Marcus Lutheran School failed to submit a random selection plan, in 
violation of state regulations. Instead, it reported to DPI that its 
&quot;congregation voted on Sunday, August 16 to participate&quot; in the 
voucher program. The very next day, the school &quot;accepted 'Choice' 
applications during [its] regularly scheduled registration day. All students who 
applied were accepted.&quot; By announcing the voucher openings to its 
congregation before announcing them to the general public, and then failing to 
use random selection, St. Marcus Lutheran School apparently filled its positions 
with its choice of students, contrary to the random selection requirement.</font></UL> 
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Louis Tucker Academy incomprehensibly described its &quot;random 
selection&quot; plan as follows: &quot;The selection of applicants will be 
informal and randomly selected based upon interest. Interest will be determined 
by the return of applications. There will be a staff of three that will select 
an equal amount of applicants on a applications are received basis. [sic] Staff 
will be randomly selected and will not have any prior notice. Each applicant 
will get a return notice from the school informing them weather [sic] or not 
they were excepted [sic] into our program.&quot;</font> </LI></UL><font size="2" face="Arial">In their letter to 
Superintendent Benson, Mincberg and Deputy Legal Director Judith E. Schaeffer, 
and NAACP attorneys James Hall and William Lynch request DPI to withhold public 
funds from the noncompliant schools pending further investigation by the state 
and corrective action by the schools to bring them into compliance with the law.</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This new evidence that voucher schools are not obeying the law 
reinforces our strong belief that vouchers are the wrong choice for Milwaukee 
and throughout the United States,&quot; said PFAWF President Carole Shields. 
&quot;Even in Milwaukee, where state law explicitly requires random selection, a 
number of voucher schools have blatantly demonstrated their failure to comply. 
We will continue to work with the NAACP and other concerned groups in Milwaukee 
to make sure that vouchers are not being used to open the door to new 
discrimination against school children there - and to oppose such programs 
around the country.&quot;</font></P>
