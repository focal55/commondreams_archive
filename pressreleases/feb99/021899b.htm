        - February 18 - </font>Minority workers holding jobs comparable to those of whites have a 
disproportionately lower rate of employer-based health insurance, according 
to a new study sponsored by The Commonwealth Fund, &quot;Employer-Sponsored 
Health Insurance: Implications for Minority Workers,&quot; by Allyson Hall 
and Karen Scott Collins of The Commonwealth Fund and Sherry Glied of 
Columbia University.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The study reveals that even after controlling for such variables
as 
sociodemographic factors, blacks and especially Hispanics consistently lag 
behind whites in employer-provided insurance. Sixty-nine percent of whites 
are insured through their employers, compared with only 52 percent of blacks 
and 44 percent of Hispanics.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Minority groups have lower rates of health care coverage because
they are more likely to work in industries that do not provide coverage, 
hold part-time jobs, and have lower incomes. But those trends account for 
only part of the story,&quot; said Karen Davis, president of The 
Commonwealth Fund. &quot;Other factors should be investigated, such as 
increasingly unaffordable premiums facing workers when employers do offer 
coverage.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Individuals who are employed full-time, work for large employers,
belong 
to unions, and work in the manufacturing and government sectors are more 
likely to have health insurance compared with other workers. Even within 
these categories, however, minority Americans appear to be at a 
disadvantage: 37 percent of Hispanic full-time workers are uninsured, 
compared with 20 percent who are black, and 12 percent who are white. In 
mid-size firms with 100 to 1,000 workers, 84 percent of whites have 
coverage, compared with 68 percent of blacks and 61 percent of Hispanics. In 
small firms with fewer than 100 workers, 63 percent of whites have employer-based coverage, compared with 47 percent of blacks
and 38 
percent of Hispanics.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Similar disparities exist when examining different industries:
within the 
manufacturing sector, for example, 85 percent of whites, 71 percent of 
blacks, and 60 percent of Hispanics have employer-based health insurance. 
Part-time minority workers also fare worse than their white colleagues, with 
less than half receiving employer-based insurance compared with nearly 
two-thirds of whites. Minority workers are less likely to be covered through 
their employer regardless of wage level. Among workers who earn less than $7 
an hour, 56 percent of whites have employer-based coverage compared with 47 
percent of blacks and 35 percent of Hispanics. For workers who earn more 
than $15 an hour, 79 percent of whites have employer-sponsored coverage, compared with 67 percent of blacks and 54 percent of Hispanics.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A variety of additional barriers may account for the difference
in 
health care coverage rates between whites and minorities,&quot; said Allyson 
Hall, program officer at the Fund. &quot;Certain groups may decline health 
care coverage not only because of financial concerns, but also because of 
differing perceptions regarding the propensity to become ill and the overall 
need for health care coverage. Further research can inform health care 
reform efforts to address cultural as well as financial barriers to insuring 
workers.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The authors offer potential solutions to the problem of lack of
coverage, 
including broadened eligibility criteria and outreach strategies that target 
low-income working families. &quot;It has been well-documented that lack of 
health coverage is linked to lack of access to health care,&quot; said Karen 
Scott Collins, M.D., assistant vice president and director of minority 
health programs at the Fund. &quot;The key to addressing inequities in 
health outcomes for minorities and reducing preventable mortality and 
morbidity is improving health insurance coverage.&quot; <BR>------ 
<BR>Methodology: Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance: Implications for Minority Workers is based on analysis of data from the 1997 March
supplement to the Current Population Survey, also known as the Annual Demographic Survey. The March supplement provides detailed
information 
on income and work experience from surveys of persons 15 years and older in 
approximately 62,500 households in the United States. <BR>------ <BR>The 
Commonwealth Fund is a private foundation supporting independent research on 
health and social issues. <BR> </font>
