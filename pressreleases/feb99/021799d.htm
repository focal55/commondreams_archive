      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 17 - Statement from Amnesty International:</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In recent months a petition in support of women's rights in Afghanistan has 
been circulated by the National Organization for Women in the USA. While 
welcoming any initiatives highlighting the plight of women in Afghanistan, 
Amnesty International does not as a matter of principle endorse statements that 
do not fall strictly within its mandate.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In solidarity with this worldwide campaign to promote women's rights, Amnesty 
International is reiterating today its position on the issue -- based on 
corroborated evidence of the human rights situation in Afghanistan -- which may 
in part differ from the above mentioned petition.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International has continuously brought the plight of Afghan women to 
the attention of the international community and has urged armed groups as well 
as countries supporting them to acknowledge their responsibility for human 
rights violations in Afghanistan and end the cycle of abuses there.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Scores of women have been abducted and raped by members of the various 
political factions, often being treated as the spoils of war. Thousands of women 
have been indiscriminately killed in fighting between opposing sides in the 
conflict, and hundreds of thousands of women and children have been displaced or 
forced to flee the country as a result of systematic human rights abuses.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In recent years, the Taleban have imposed a new form of repression against 
women in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar and other areas they control. The situation of 
women in these areas deserves special attention by the international community.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Tens of thousands of women remain restricted to their homes under Taleban 
edicts banning them from seeking employment, education or leaving home 
unaccompanied by a male relative. Other measures restricting women include the 
closure of women's hammams (public baths). Women are also barred from the 
streets for certain periods during the fasting month of Ramadan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These restrictions have been enforced through the use of cruel, inhuman and 
degrading punishments and ill-treatment including the beating of women by 
Taleban guards in detention centers or in public places.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International welcomes any move to restore Afghan women's rights to 
education, employment, gender equality and access to health facilities and will 
continue to consider women detained or physically restricted on account of their 
gender as prisoners of conscience.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization fully supports any initiative seeking to highlight the 
flagrant abuse of women's human rights in Afghanistan, and which recognizes the 
vital role that the international community can play in bringing such abuses to 
an end.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Amnesty International takes no position on the question 
of recognition of any party or government but calls on all armed political 
groups in Afghanistan to respect fundamental human rights, in accordance with 
international human rights standards and the principles of humanitarian law.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Governments with a vested interest in Afghanistan who appear to provide 
military support to the warring factions must accept responsibility for fuelling 
human rights abuses. Governments which provide political and material support to 
Afghanistan's warring factions should hold leaders of armed groups to account 
for the human rights abuses committed against women in Afghanistan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">However, responsibility to end the suffering of Afghan women is not confined 
to governments directly involved in the country. In September 1995, at the 
Fourth UN World Conference on Women, governments of the world committed 
themselves to ensuring the full implementation of the human rights of women and 
of the girl child as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the Beijing Declaration they pledged their determination &quot;to advance 
the goals of equality, development and peace for all women everywhere in the 
interest of all humanity&quot;. It is now their chance to enforce respect for 
women's human rights in Afghanistan.</font></P>
