        - February 23 - </font>
A coalition including many formerly blacklisted writers will protest Elia 
Kazan's Lifetime Achievement Award from the Motion Picture Academy on 
Sunday, March 21st. Kazan, who directed such classics as On the Waterfront 
and Streetcar Named Desire stands by his actions, many of his colleagues 
many of his colleagues have still not forgiven him for informing on 
suspected &quot;subversives&quot; during the post-war House UnAmerican 
Activities Committee hearings. Protesters will gather at 3:00 pm the day of 
the Oscar ceremony at First and Grand near the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Committee Against Silence, coordinators of the protest,
        hope to draw hundreds of people to join in the peaceful demonstration 
outside the Oscars ceremony. Opponents of the award plan to publish a 
full-page ad in Daily Variety on March 19th. Media coverage of the 
controversy already includes CNN, Good Morning America and the New York 
Times; international coverage includes the BBC and Rome's La Republica. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Kazan chose to cooperate with HUAC, which caused enormous
        damage to our industry,&quot; said blacklisted writer Bernard Gordon, a 
co-chair of the committee. &quot;HUAC was also demonstrably anti-Semitic. 
What Kazan did does not call for honors or public acclaim. Kazan's choice 
destroyed the careers of many of his talented friends and colleagues,&quot; 
Gordon added. &quot;The Academy should not honor the life of a dishonorable 
man.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Academy's action has more to do with current politics than
        artistic achievement, say critics. &quot;In a recent interview, Charlton 
Heston not only defended the award for Kazan based on artistic merit but 
defended Kazan's actions, arguing in essence that he helped win the Cold 
War,&quot; said committee co-chair Leone Hankey. &quot;This is precisely the 
sort of political abuse of an artistic medium and community that we must 
speak out against.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The blacklist's old wounds are only beginning to 
heal. In 1997, four entertainment guilds apologized for the role their 
members played in the destruction of thousands of lives. However, neither the Academy nor Kazan have ever apologized for their roles in cooperating 
with the blacklisting campaign. &quot;The Academy has reopened the scar. 
This award is a signal to the current generation to silence their own dissenting 
views and keep them out of the culture,&quot; said Hankey. &quot;Will artistic 
statements opposed to government or corporate excesses be censored by today's 
movie moguls?&quot; she asked.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some Academy members oppose Kazan's award 
and the Academy's failure to consult its 5,900 membership on the matter. 
Thirty-nine people on the Board of Governors made this controversial 
decision with no knowledge or comment from the membership.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Endorsers of 
the demonstration include writers Bernard Gordon, Abe Polonsky,and Bobby 
Lees, all directly affected by black-listing. Children of the blacklisted, 
including Becca Wilson are also speaking out against the award. The protest 
is also endorsed by the Los Angeles Greens, National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Office of the Americas,and
        many other 
progressive groups. <BR><BR>For further information call (323)935-8585
