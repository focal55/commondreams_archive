        - February 2 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Mercury contamination in at least forty states has reached such high levels that 
state officials are advising residents to limit their consumption of fish from 
one or more bodies of water, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG, 
Mercury Policy Project, and California Communities Against Toxics. <I>Fishing 
for Trouble: A Survey of Mercury Contamination in America’s Waterways</I> also 
finds that systems for issuing advisories vary widely state to state and that 
many states allow potentially unsafe levels of mercury concentration in fish 
before warning the public.<BR><BR>“Our environment and our food supply are 
widely and dangerously contaminated with mercury - one of the most hazardous 
substances known to science,&quot; said Jeremiah Baumann, U.S. PIRG Environmental 
Associate.  Eating fish from many lakes and rivers in the U.S. could result in 
serious health problems, including neurological disorders in children, yet there 
is no consistent national system for warning the public that their fish may be 
contaminated.<BR><BR><I>Fishing for Trouble </I>reports that some states do not 
issue warnings until mercury concentrations in fish reach levels more than five 
time higher than levels considered safe in other states.  In addition to noting 
the lack of consistent warning systems for potential consumers of freshwater 
fish, the report calls attention to the lack of information on sources of 
mercury pollution.<BR><BR>It is especially important for children and any woman 
who could become pregnant to avoid consuming mercury-contaminated fish, but in 
many states, a woman looking to protect herself or her children may not know the 
true extent of mercury contamination, said U.S. PIRGs Baumann.  In addition, 
because of a loophole in the federal Right to Know reporting law, the vast
        majority - more than 90 percent - of mercury emissions go unreported to the public and 
policy makers.  Nowhere can we find information at the local level on where the 
mercury pollution is coming from.<BR><BR>The EPA is currently considering 
strengthening the federal Right to Know programs reporting requirements for 
mercury and other substances that persist in the environment and build up in 
animal and human tissues, but their proposal fails to require complete reporting 
of mercury releases into the environment.<BR><BR><I>Fishing for Trouble 
</I>compiles information obtained by survey from state health and environmental 
agencies.  Other findings of the report 
include:</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Ten states have 
issued statewide advisories to limit fish consumption because of mercury 
contamination:  Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and 
Vermont.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Twelve states conduct no or 
very limited monitoring of waterways for mercury contamination in fish:  Alaska, 
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, 
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Sixteen states issue mercury 
advisories based on an action level of mercury concentration in fish that is 
likely to be inadequate for protecting public health:  Alabama, Arizona, 
Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and West 
Virginia.  </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" face="Arial">States with the weakest 
systems for issuing advisories to sensitive populations include:  Alabama, 
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Mississippi, South Dakota, Virginia, and Wyoming.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mercury levels have 
been increasing in the environment at a rate of 1.5 percent per year since 1970 
and that spells trouble, said Michael Bender, Executive Director of the Mercury 
Policy.  We strongly urge all levels of government to heed the call of the U.S. 
Tuna Foundation and work toward the elimination of all mercury emissions from 
human activities.<BR><BR>The U.S. Tuna Foundation, including StarKist Foods, 
Bumble Bee Seafoods, and Chicken of the Sea International, has joined those 
calling for a solution to the problem of mercury contamination.  They have 
worked with the Mercury Policy Project to develop a fishing industry resolution 
calling on all levels of government to reduce and ultimately eliminate mercury 
emissions from anthropogenic sources.<BR><BR>U.S. PIRG and the Mercury Policy 
Project are calling on the federal and state governments to protect citizens 
from mercury contamination.  Specifically, the groups recommend that:<BR><BR>1)  
EPA, FDA and state governments should create a thorough and routine system for 
monitoring mercury contamination, as well as a consistent, effective, and 
protective system for warning the public about the risks of mercury 
exposure.<BR><BR>2)  EPA and Congress should strengthen the Right to Know 
program to include complete information on mercury pollution.  To protect public 
health and the environment, EPA must set a zero threshold for reporting of 
persistent or bioaccumulative substances like mercury.<BR><BR>3)  The Clinton 
Administration and Congress should take steps to reduce and eliminate mercury 
pollution into the environment, including setting strict mercury emissions 
standards from polluting sources like coal and oil-fired power 
plants.<BR><BR>The U.S. EPA must stand strong against pressure from polluting 
industries and strengthen their proposed changes to the Right to Know program, 
said Jeremiah Baumann.  We should eliminate mercury pollution.  At a minimum, we 
have the right to know which polluters are responsible.<BR></font></p>
