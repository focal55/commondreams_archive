        - February 8 -
Taxpayers lost $45 million on commercial logging programs in their national 
forests in Fiscal Year 1997, the most recent year for which figures are 
available, according to an analysis by The Wilderness Society released today. 
<BR><BR>The analysis, covering commercial logging sales in 104 national forest 
units, found that 83 of those forests lost money selling timber. The news came 
amid expectations that the U.S. Forest Service, which manages the forests, will 
announce a new policy on roadbuilding later this week. The cost of building 
roads to carry logging trucks in and out of the forests is a major reason for 
the red ink.<BR><BR>&quot;From New England to Alaska, taxpayers are taking a 
bath,&quot; said Wilderness Society President William H. Meadows. &quot;But the 
financial toll is only part of the problem. The logging and roadbuilding are 
doing enormous damage to some of the best lands in America. They pollute our 
streams, damage wildlife habitat, tarnish the scenery, and promote mudslides. 
It's a lose-lose situation.&quot;<BR><BR>Commercial logging, which accounts for 
about half the total logging volume, has been a money-loser in the national 
forests for years. The costs are high, and much of the timber is of limited 
market value. The pricing system was not designed to cover all the costs of 
making the trees available. <BR><BR>The analysis comes as The Wilderness Society 
prepares to unveil its vision for national forests in the 21st century Thursday. 
It is founded on five principles, and its recommendations include: 
&quot;Activities such as timber production shall not be conducted with taxpayer 
subsidies.&quot;<BR><BR>The biggest money-loser once again was the Tongass, a 
rare temperate rain forest in Southeast Alaska. &quot;It is beyond belief that 
taxpayers were held up for $42 million while ancient spruce and hemlock, 
hundreds of feet tall, were clearcut by timber companies,&quot; said Michael 
Francis, director of The Wilderness Society's national forests program. 
&quot;The Forest Service's proposed management plan for the Tongass fails to 
stop this travesty, and we have appealed it to the Forest Service 
chief.&quot;<BR><BR>Rounding out the top ten were the Kootenai (MT), Mt. 
Baker-Snoqualmie (WA), Winema (OR), Nez Perce (ID), Boise (ID), Clearwater (ID), 
Payette (ID), North Carolina, and Malheur (OR).<BR><BR>Martha Marks, president 
of Republicans for Environmental Protection, said, &quot;We oppose subsidies 
that waste taxpayers' money and squander our nation's natural heritage. We must 
safeguard our forests and protect taxpayers by ending below-cost 
logging-now!&quot;<BR><BR>Carolyn Alkire, the resource economist who converted 
the Forest Service's data into the profit-and-loss figures, said the commercial 
logging program has failed to react to changes in what Americans want most from 
their forests. &quot;The real value of our national forests comes not from 
lumber but from a range of other continuing services, including clean water for 
municipal systems, healthy fisheries, air purification, biodiversity 
conservation, and recreation,&quot; she explained. &quot;The national forests 
receive three times as many visitors as the national parks. We wouldn't treat 
our national parks as industrial zones, but that's pretty much how we've tended 
to operate many of our national forests.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;On the bright 
side,&quot; Meadows observed, &quot;Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck is trying 
to change the outdated priorities. In his two years on the job he has begun 
talking a different language, shifting policies, and installing people who share 
his goal of ending the chop-until-you-drop approach of yesteryear. But the 
agency still has a way to go. We'll have a clearer view of just how bold the 
Chief is once we see the plan for putting a moratorium on roadbuilding in the 60 
million acres of unprotected roadless areas.<BR><BR>&quot;Believe it or not, our 
national forests already have more than 400,000 miles of roads,&quot; Meadows 
noted. &quot;That's enough to go to the moon and halfway back. That should be 
enough. With land being gobbled up rapidly by sprawl, it is critical that we 
keep as much of our wild land in its natural condition as possible. We owe that 
much to future generations.&quot; <BR><BR>Founded in 1935, The Wilderness 
Society is a 200,000-member non-profit conservation organization dedicated to 
establishing a national network of wild lands, and to fostering an American land 
ethic. The group specializes in issues involving America's public lands and has 
offices in Washington, DC, and eight other cities.</font>
