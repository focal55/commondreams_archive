        - February 10 - Statement by Wenonah Hauter, Director of Public
        Citizens' Critical Mass Energy Project:</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Public Citizen opposes the Exxon-Mobil merger because it would be harmful to 
consumers, workers, the environment, the economy and our political 
democracy.</font></p>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The corporate marriage between these two large pieces of the former Standard 
Oil trust would create the largest corporation in the world. There is every 
indication, based on an examination of the history of the oil industry, that 
this marriage between two oil and drilling titans would lead to anti-competitive 
behavior, especially in the many areas where Exxon and Mobil now compete head to 
head.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1909 when a federal judge ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil for 
conspiring to constrain trade, the Octopus, as it was known at the time, 
controlled 85% of the oil market. President Teddy Roosevelt said triumphantly 
that the decision &quot;was one of the most signal [sic] triumphs for decency 
which has been won in our country.&quot; We should learn from the lessons of the 
past. Mergers lead to consolidation, which means fewer competitors and 
eventually higher prices for consumers.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">However, anti-competitive behavior is not the only problem. The merger would 
create an oil giant with enormous political power. United, these two corporate 
giants would have an even greater ability to skew critical policy debates over 
matters such as labor standards, global climate change, oil and gas exploration 
in pristine areas, government support for renewable energy and energy efficiency 
technologies, and corporate tax subsidies.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The oil and gas industry already uses their economic resources to subvert 
public policy. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the oil and gas 
industry contributed $6,321,473 in political action committee (PAC) 
contributions to federal candidates in the 1998-election cycle. Of this amount, 
21% went to Democrats while Republicans collected 79%.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Exxon Corporation’s PAC was second largest, and Mobil Oil’s PAC placed 
fourth. In the1998 Congressional election cycle, Exxon's PAC contributed 
$482,900 to federal candidates (94% to Republicans) while Mobil's PAC chipped in 
$237,250 (88% to Republicans).</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">However, campaign contributions were small in contrast to the amount of money 
that these corporations spent on lobbying activities. In 1997 alone, the oil and 
gas industry spent $62 million dollars on lobbying with Exxon and Mobil each 
spending over $5 million dollars. This is an enormous amount of money and its 
influence on our democratic process is shameful.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Approval of the Exxon-Mobil merger should not move forward. It would also 
encourage other mergers in the oil industry, further concentrating power and 
intensifying the remaining firms' oligopolistic pricing power. The result would 
be even less responsiveness to public demands for corporate responsibility.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We recommend the following actions:</font> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Congress should hold both regional hearings on the merger and hearings in 
communities that would be affected the most.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Congress should hold hearings in both the Senate and the House to explore the 
implications for consumers, the environment and workers.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Federal Trade Commission should block the merger.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House International Relations 
committees should hold hearings on human rights abuses associated with Exxon and 
Mobil's overseas operations.</font></P>
