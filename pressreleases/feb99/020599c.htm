        - February 5 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen today denounced a draft 
report from the chair of the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, 
Sen. John Breaux (D-La.), saying it would benefit the healthy and wealthy at the 
expense of those who can afford it least.</font>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The Commission is due to deliver its report at the end of the 
month, but Sen. Breaux presented a skeletal draft of a possible majority 
Commission report January 26, 1999.</font> </P>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Breaux proposal is too silent on many tough issues 
for it to find common ground among 11 of the 17 Commissioners - the 
supermajority needed to report to Congress,&quot; said Public Citizen President 
Joan Claybrook. &quot;But even in its skeletal form, the proposal is 
sufficiently clear to be opposed.&quot;</font> </P>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The consumer advocacy group outlined the reasons it opposed the 
proposal:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Eliminates the Medicare entitlement</font></B><font size="2" face="Arial">. Right now, Medicare 
guarantees beneficiaries access to a defined set of health benefits with an 
established cost-sharing ratio between the government and beneficiaries. If 
healthcare costs go up, so does what the government pays. Under the Breaux plan 
beneficiaries would be entitled to a defined contribution only. </font> <I><font size="2" face="Arial">The trial 
balloon is &quot;soft&quot; on the question of how specific the benefits package 
for private plans would be - Breaux is looking for a compromise that brings in 
both the Commission's &quot;leave it completely up to the market&quot; and 
&quot;define the benefits&quot; wings. But even if a benefit package were 
specified, it would be difficult if not impossible to force profit-motivated 
managed care providers to comply with it.</font></P></I><B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">2.</font></B><font size="2" face="Arial"> <B>Turns Medicare into a voucher program.</B> Under the 
Breaux plan there would be two delivery systems: fee-for-service 
(&quot;traditional Medicare&quot;), with HCFA granted some additional authority 
to control costs, and the &quot;premium support&quot; or &quot;voucher&quot; 
system. The government would make a defined contribution toward the cost of an 
individual's healthcare. It could be used as a voucher to pay part of the 
premium of a private health plan. </font> <I><font size="2" face="Arial">But &quot;traditional Medicare&quot; 
spending per person would also be capped at the private voucher amount. If 
health care costs per person exceeded what the voucher would buy - e.g., because 
sicker individuals with more costly healthcare needs enrolled in 
&quot;traditional Medicare&quot; in disproportionate numbers - those individuals 
would be liable for a larger and larger share of cost than is now the 
case.</font></P></I><B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Turns Medicare over to the market.
</font> </B><font size="2" face="Arial">However the details 
of the Breaux plan are filled in, its fundamental philosophy is to turn Medicare 
into a healthcare delivery system in which market competition among largely 
for-profit managed care plans determines cost, quality and access to care. The 
market has a track record in Medicare, and it is not 
good:</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">- 100 HMOs, 87% of them for-profit, dumped over 400,000 
Medicare beneficiaries at the end of last year because they decided the business 
was not profitable. This may be fully acceptable market behavior, but is it what 
we want for Medicare?</font> </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">- The Medicare population is sharply skewed: 5% of 
beneficiaries account for 50% of expenditures; 10% account for over 75% of the 
program's cost. Although HCFA has recently proposed adjusting the rates paid 
private plans to account for higher risk patients this type of regulation is 
strongly opposed by many private market advocates. With such a strong incentive 
to attract and keep only the healthier, lower cost beneficiaries, for-profit 
managed care firms will engage in significant cherry picking. Traditional 
Medicare would be left with the sickest patients - who would now also be 
required to pay a greater share of their healthcare costs as the 
&quot;voucher&quot; rate caps what the government pays.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Raises the eligibility age from 65 to 67.</font></B><font size="2" face="Arial"> This would 
throw several million more people into the ranks of the uninsured - and save 
very little money, since under current law working people between the ages of 65 
and 70 who have employer-paid insurance get their primary coverage from their 
employer anyway.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The Breaux plan does not address the main problems facing 
Medicare:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">* Failure to cover prescription drugs</font></B><font size="2" face="Arial">. Both the Medicare 
program and Medicare beneficiaries who lack outpatient prescription drug 
coverage pay full sticker price for prescription drugs - twice as much as the 
Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and about twice as much as the same 
drugs cost in Canada and Mexico. The pharmaceutical industry has long blocked 
adding a drug benefit to Medicare because it opposes government price controls, 
which are crucial to such a benefit. The Breaux proposal punts: it mentions 
drugs only under &quot;Areas that Need Resolution.&quot; Co-chair Bill Thomas
(R-Calif.) and other pro-drug industry Commissioners have stated publicly that 
they will block any effort to make prescription drugs a covered benefit in the 
&quot;traditional Medicare&quot; program - they would be available only through 
private HMOs.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">* <B>Failure to reduce beneficiary out of pocket expenditures. 
</B>The average Medicare beneficiary pays over $2,000 a year - about 20% of 
average beneficiary income - for out of pocket healthcare expenses. The Breaux 
proposal would <I>probably</I> increase these amounts:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">- by ending &quot;first dollar coverage&quot; for co-payments 
through Medigap or employer-paid supplemental insurance;</font></P>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">- by combining the Parts A &amp; B deductibles to create one 
annual deductible - pegged at &quot;perhaps $350&quot; in the Breaux proposal - 
a dollar amount high enough to constitute a barrier to care for 
some.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">* <B>Failure to address the financial challenges facing 
Medicare.</B> President Clinton's proposal to use 16% of the surplus, $650 
billion over 15 years, to keep the Part A trust fund solvent until 2020, is a 
positive proposal. But a number of Commissioners, including the co-chairs, have 
criticized the President's action - they have called it an &quot;obstacle&quot; 
to their efforts to use &quot;Medicare is going broke&quot; as a rationale for 
destroying the program in order to save it. The Department of Health and Human 
Services Inspector General estimates that waste, fraud and abuse costs the 
Medicare program <I><B>more than $20 billion a year</B></I>. The Commission has 
no proposals on curtailing fraud and abuse.</font></P><B>
<P align=justify><font size="2" face="Arial">The Breaux proposal undermines Medicare as a social insurance 
program.</font></B><font size="2" face="Arial"> Medicare is based on a social compact between the young and the 
old, between the sick and the healthy, and between the less well off 
economically and those with higher incomes. The Breaux proposal would erode this 
social compact and individualize risks and benefits. The healthier and wealthier 
would do well; those with greater medical needs and lower incomes would 
not.</font></P>
