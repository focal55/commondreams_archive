        YORK - February </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">2
        - </font><I>Statement by Gloria Feldt<BR>President, Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America:</I></font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The verdict issued today by an 
Oregon jury in <I>Planned Parenthood v. ACLA</I>, sends an important 
message—that Americans stand united against terrorism and threats of 
terrorism.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The jury saw anti-choice Wanted Posters for what they 
are—a hit list for terrorists,&quot; said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). &quot;The American people—represented 
by this jury—have clearly stated that our society will neither tolerate 
violence, nor tolerate intimidation by domestic terrorists who issue thinly 
veiled threats of violence. Whether these threats are posted on trees or on the 
Internet, their intent and impact is the same: to threaten the lives of doctors 
who courageously serve women seeking to exercise their right to choose 
abortion.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Doctor David Gunn and Dr. John B. Britton were shot to 
death after being targeted individually on wanted posters. Dr. George Tiller, 
one of those named on the &quot;Deadly Dozen&quot; poster, was wounded by 
gunshots. The name of Dr. Barnett Slepian was posted on the Nuremberg Files Web 
site—with a line through it to indicate his murder—within hours after he was 
cruelly slain in his home by a sniper last October. Dr. Slepian's killer is 
still at large, as is the perpetrator of the deadly clinic bombing a year ago in 
Birmingham, Alabama. Planned Parenthood filed this suit in 1995, but the threat 
of violence remains quite real today.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These defendants care nothing 
about our democratic freedoms,&quot; said Feldt. &quot;They respect neither the 
rights of women nor the lives of the doctors who care for women. Their threats 
of violence and their public 'justification' of murder are meant to terrorize 
and intimidate, so that others cannot exercise their own rights. They have 
intentionally created a climate of fear and violence, yet they cowardly refuse 
to accept any legal or moral responsibility for it. Today's verdict strikes back 
in defense of our doctors, our patients, and our constitutional right to provide 
important health services and information, free from 
fear.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The jury could see the tremendous harm done to the 
physicians as individuals, and to the women's health care institutions that were 
the targets of these threats,&quot; said PPFA Director of Litigation Roger 
Evans, who was co-counsel for the plaintiffs. &quot;We will use this judgment to 
try to deny these people financial resources for any future dirty work. This 
case should leave no doubt in the minds of those who threaten our liberties that 
Planned Parenthood, together with other people of conscience, will take every 
step available within the law to defend our freedoms, and to protect our 
patients, our doctors, and our clinics. We could not have succeeded in this case 
without the expert and tireless pro-bono work of the New York law firm Paul, 
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison, and the Portland law firm Davis, Wright, 
and Tremaine. We are tremendously grateful for their help.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We 
cannot restore the lives of those who have been killed so that American women no 
longer die from unsafe, illegal abortions,&quot; said Feldt. &quot;But this 
verdict reminds us all that while Americans have a great diversity of thoughts 
and feelings about abortion, we speak with one voice to renounce domestic 
terrorists.&quot;</font></p>
