        - February 23 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">
Yesterday afternoon at around 1:20 p.m., I opened a letter addressed to NOW 
stained with a brown  powder.  It said &quot;<A 
href="http://www.aomc.org/ComDiseases/Anthrax.html">Anthrax</A>.  Have a nice 
Death.&quot;  I called 911 immediately, and spent the next six hours in 
isolation.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I found out later that similar letters were received yesterday at clinics in 
Kansas City and Delaware, as well as at the National Office of the <A 
href="http://www.naral.org/choice/index.html">National Abortion and Reproductive 
Rights Action League</A>, and that today a clinic in Pittsburgh was targeted.   
According to the <A href="http://www.prochoice.org/">National Abortion 
Federation</A>, approximately two dozen clinics have been targeted with Anthrax 
threats in the last two weeks.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Thankfully, all of these letters have thus far proven to be hoaxes.  But they 
communicated their intended message:  Right-wing terrorists will stop at nothing 
to stop women from exercising their right to choose.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Given the growing number of cities targeted by this threat, there need to be 
protocols in place from the moment of the 911 call onward to ensure that the 
threat is treated seriously and contained as quickly as possible.  Yesterday's 
ordeal left me with two conflicting impressions.  I learned that the Police and 
the City Administration take this matter quite seriously, and that they had 
every intention of following protocols designed to handle the threat of 
biological weapons.  However, I also learned that those protocols have a long 
way to go in order to be effective, particularly in the first instance.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For example, before I was placed in isolation yesterday, I was in the 
presence of at least 15 police officers and five civilians, all of whom would 
have been exposed had the threat not proven a hoax.  I was faced with ignorance 
on the part of police as to how to handle the situation, confusion on the part 
of the hazardous materials team over what was and was not considered a threat, 
and in-fighting between agencies that caused dangerous delays.  The most 
sensible and informed voice in the entire team was the representative from the 
department of health, who, coincidentally perhaps, was the only woman on the 
scene.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The attacks over the last two days underline the fact that everyone is at 
risk.  While the prior attacks have effected mainly abortion providers, this is 
the first such attack targeting an advocacy organization.  And it is the first 
such attack in the New York City area.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I hope that this will galvanize the pro-choice community in New York City.  
The overwhelming majority of New Yorkers are pro-choice, but they don't realize 
that this kind of thing can happen in our backyard.  Yesterday's incident at NOW 
shows that it can.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">NOW is committed to demonstrating that such attacks will not shut us down—in 
fact we will keep fighting harder than ever.  We will continue to push for a 
clinic access bill in New York State that will protect doctors and clinic staff 
in their workplace and in their homes.  We will push for meaningful enforcement 
of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Law, and the City Clinic Access 
Law.  We will push for meaningful police protection of clinics that are facing 
threats of violence daily.  And we will push for improved protocols for handling 
the specific kinds of attacks that clinics and pro-choice groups are facing.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We will not be intimidated or silenced, because the right to control our own 
bodies is the most fundamental right we have gained over the past thirty years.  
And we are not about to let these hypocrites and thugs take it away from us. </font>
