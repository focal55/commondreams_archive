        - February 23 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Abdullah Öcalan's trial must respect international justice standards, Amnesty 
International said today in a letter to the Turkish Prime Minister Bülent
        Ecevit.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization acknowledges in the letter the high emotions involved in the 
case, and stresses that &quot;fair trial concerns begin from the point of arrest 
-- which in this case was apparently not lawful -- and continue throughout the 
preliminary investigation.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization expresses concern at the fact that Abdullah Öcalan did not 
have access to a lawyer until seven days after his detention.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Turkish authorities treatment of Abdullah Öcalan so far 
undermines confidence that standards of justice will be respected during the 
later stages of the trial,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;He must be 
immediately granted access to a lawyer of his choice.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Incommunicado detention -- permitted for up to for days under Turkey's 
Criminal Procedure Code -- threatens a detainee's right to a completely fair 
trial as well as increasing the risk of ill-treatment or torture.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In its letter, the organization remind Prime Minister Ecevit that the world 
will use international human rights standards to judge the fairness or otherwise 
of the trial which Abdullah Öcalan is to face.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These standards are not foreign prescriptions, inappropriate to the 
Turkish situation, but were composed with the participation and approval of 
Turkish governments,&quot; Amnesty International stressed. &quot;Those in the 
form of treaties were freely ratified by the Turkish parliament, and under 
Article 90 of the Turkish Constitution, form an integral part of Turkish 
domestic law.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization also expresses concern that Abdullah Öcalan is to be tried 
under the rules of a State Security Court.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the three State Security Court judges, and often the prosecutor, is a 
serving soldier. It is clearly far from satisfactory for a civilian on trial for 
his life, and who has been in bloody conflict with the Turkish armed forces for 
at least 15 years, to be tried by a semi-military tribunal, Amnesty 
International argues.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In a previous case (Incal v Turkey), the European Court of Human Rights ruled 
that &quot;the applicant had legitimate cause to doubt the impartiality of Izmir 
State Security Court.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In admitting the case of Ciraklar v Turkey, the European Human Rights 
Commission stated that the State Security Court's &quot;lack of independence and 
impartiality has been established.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our observation of many trials in Turkey leads Amnesty International to 
believe that the principle of 'equality of arms' is not consistently recognized 
in State Security Courts,&quot; Amnesty International stresses. The arrangement 
of the court places the prosecutor alongside the judges and the defendant and 
their counsel in a visibly junior position. This relationship is frequently 
reflected in the conduct of the trial itself -- since judges very frequently 
ignore the defense counsel's requests to call, examine and cross-examine 
witnesses, or to call court surveys or other mechanisms which might establish 
innocence or mitigation.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International's letter reminds the Prime Minister that both the 
prosecution and the defense must be treated in a manner ensuring that they have 
procedurally equal positions during the course of the trial, and are in an equal 
position to make their case.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization is calling on the Turkish authorities should do all in their 
power to ensure that hearings are held as openly as possible. Except in narrowly 
defined circumstances, all court hearings must be public, according to Article 
10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention. 
This right is relied upon by trial observers. The UN Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders underlines their right &quot;to attend public hearings, proceedings 
and trials, so as to form an opinion on their compliance with national law and 
applicable international obligations and commitments.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Everyone has the right to be presumed innocent, and treated as 
innocent, until and unless they are convicted,&quot; Amnesty International says. 
&quot; Judges and prosecutors must refrain from pre-judging any case - but this 
responsibility also applies to all other public officials who should not make 
statements about the guilt or innocence of an accused before the outcome of the 
trial.&quot; The letter also calls on the authorities to understand their duty 
to prevent, using legal action if necessary, the news media from influencing the 
outcome of the case by pronouncing on its merits.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Abdullah Öcalan faces charges which carry the death penalty. Since Turkey has 
not carried out any executions since 1984, it is classed by Amnesty 
International as a de facto abolitionist state. This was a great step forward, 
which has not been sufficiently recognized. Amnesty International urges the 
Turkish parliament to maintain its moratorium on executions, and the Turkish 
Government to sign the sixth optional protocol to the European Convention and 
thereby remove the death penalty altogether.</font></P>
