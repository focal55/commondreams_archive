        National coordinator of the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom,
        Gage said: "The President's lawyers said it was fundamentally unfair that
        they were asked to defend him having seen only a small portion of the thousands of pages of testimony. This was secret evidence. They are right,
        but it is also secret evidence that Clinton's Department of Justice is using
        to deny bond and deport several dozen immigrants without due process. These
        individuals have been jailed for years while fighting deportation and yet
        they are not charged with any crime." She added that "no one, not the President, not any individual in the U.S., should face accusations using
        secret evidence. The use of secret evidence should be outlawed."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">KEVIN GRAY<br>
Author of the forthcoming "The Death of Black Politics" and a board member of the national ACLU, Gray said: "Jesse Jackson compares Clinton to Martin
Luther King, but Clinton has manipulated images of King for his own ends. Clinton used Rosa Parks at the State of the Union address as a prop -- his
speech contained no initiatives on civil rights.... Clinton's 'civil rights record' is purely symbolic. Consider Clinton's treatment of Lani Guinier and
Jocelyn Elders; or his 'welfare reform'; or his continued double standards in the 'war on drugs'; or his outrageous proposal that citizens in public
housing surrender their Fourth Amendment rights. Clinton benefits from the black community's deep mistrust of prosecutors. Meanwhile, black-white
wealth disparity remains fixed and the gap between rich and poor expands. Black politics is at an all-time low because of the leadership's alliance
with Clinton -- that must be challenged."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">GWENDOLYN MINK, <a href="mailto:mink@cats.ucsc.edu">mink@cats.ucsc.edu</a><br>
Professor of politics at the University of California at Santa Cruz and author of "Hostile Environment," a forthcoming book on sexual
harassment, Mink said: "Clinton made trashing women the national pastime; every woman
with a story to tell became a woman with a foul motive or a questionable mental state. Clinton also manipulated everyone, including leading
feminists, into changing the subject from his obligation to tell the truth in a civil rights case to his right to sexual privacy.... He's stripped poor
women of their privacy and coerced them into the labor market. What worries me now is the fallout of Clinton's defense and 'triumph' on women who need
sexual harassment law. Unless women can be confident that the law is scrupulously fair, that their harassers must tell the truth, and that their
harassment counts, the law will fall into disuse among women who most need its ballast: women who are compelled to take jobs in exchange for welfare;
women who cannot quit their jobs because they are poor; women who must survive a gauntlet of sexual abuse in order to earn a living."</font> </P>
