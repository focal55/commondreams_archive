      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - February 1 - </font>President's Clinton's 2000 budget request given to Congress
        today, barely  increases HIV prevention efforts for the third year in a row, despite unsettling reports from the Centers For Disease Control and
        Prevention (CDC) that unsafe sex is on the rise.  The President has requested $666 million for HIV prevention for fiscal year 2000, a 1.4%
        increase compared to the $657 million approved in last year's omnibus spending bill.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">        "A budget reflects priorities," said Winnie
Stachelberg, HRC's political director.  "Last year and the year before that, the
administration has chosen not to make HIV prevention a priority.  We call on the President to reconsider this choice and work with Congress to
address this huge gap in the national response to the AIDS epidemic."</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">        Last week, the CDC reported that the number of gay men in San
Francisco who reported having unprotected sex increased from 30.4% in 1994 to  39.2 percent in 1997.  Men, primarily those 25 and younger, who said
they had unprotected sex with more than one person also increased from 23.6% in 1994 to 33 percent in 1997.  The CDC reports that young gay and
bisexual men are less likely to engage in safe sex than older men.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">         "While AIDS deaths have gone down as a result of these drugs, the
sad reality is that HIV infection rates have remained constant and AIDS remains the number one killer of African-Americans and Latinos
age 25-44.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This epidemic is far from over, and until we start significantly reducing
HIV infection rates, it never will be," said Seth Kilbourn, HRC's senior health policy advocate.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">        Acting on a recommendation from the Presidential Advisory Council
on HIV/AIDS, the budget offered $10 million for a national HIV counseling and testing awareness campaign, modeled on the current National Youth
Anti-Drug Media Campaign coordinated by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">        "This campaign is a step in the right direction.  It will help
educate and encourage more people to know their HIV status, which is key in stopping the progression of the disease," said
Kilbourn.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As the budget and appropriations process moves forward, HRC
is committed to working with the administration and Congress on a comprehensive HIV prevention plan.  Such a plan should include adequate
funding for existing efforts, support for local needle exchange programs, substance abuse treatment for everyone who seeks it, and a
national social marketing campaign designed to reduce the stigma of HIV, highlight methods
to reduce or eliminate risk, and encourage people to know their HIV status.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">         The fiscal 2000 budget includes modest increases in funding for
HIV and AIDS treatment programs like the Ryan White CARE Act for which the President requested an increase of $100 million.  The CARE Act includes
funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs and comprehensive care and vital lifesaving supportive services for low income people with HIV.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">        Also included in the President's request is funding for the  "Work
Incentives Improvement Act of 1999".  Introduced on Jan. 28 by Senators Jeffords, R-VT, Kennedy, D-MA, Roth, R-DE, and
Moynihan, D-NY, the bill would  ensure that a person with a disability, including someone with HIV
disease, would have continued access to adequate and affordable health insurance when he or she returns to work.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">         The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the community.</font> </P>
