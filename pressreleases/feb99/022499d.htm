        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - February 24 - </font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">A court-appointed Teamster election official has ordered a rerun in the 
election for the office of Southern Region Vice President after finding serious 
violations of election rules, according to a ruling issued by Election Appeals 
Master Kenneth Conboy. The decision, which was issued late yesterday, also 
upheld the remainder of the election.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In an appeal filed by the Public Citizen Litigation Group on behalf of Doug 
Mims, a candidate on the Tom Leedham slate, Conboy ruled that the violations 
could have affected the outcome of the close election in the South, and that the 
proper remedy for those violations, which involved an illegal campaign 
contribution, was to give the members another chance to vote on candidates 
rather than allowing Teamster President James Hoffa to appoint a candidate. The 
Teamsters Union is the largest union in the country, representing 1.4 million 
members.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This decision shows the continuing need for effective, independent 
supervision of Teamster elections,&quot; said Paul Alan Levy, the Litigation 
Group lawyer who represented Mims. &quot;Without aggressive investigation, J.D. 
Potter's violations would never have been found, and without an independent 
authority to decide election matters, James Hoffa and his newly elected 
executive board would have succeeded in preventing the members from choosing 
their own leadership.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is anticipated, however, that the newly elected Teamster leadership 
will press hard to avoid any future government involvement in supervising union 
elections.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The court-appointed Election Officer, Michael
Cherkasky, had agreed that 
there were serious violations of the court-approved Election Rules by J.D. 
Potter, a candidate for Vice President on the Hoffa slate, and ordered Potter 
disqualified for perjuring himself during the investigation of the violation. 
However, Cherkasky also decided that the violations did not affect the outcome 
of the election, even though the Hoffa slate's margin of victory in the South 
was razor thin. Instead, he decided to certify the election with the seat 
vacant, ruling that Hoffa could fill the vacancy after taking office.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Conboy held that Potter's violation -- fraudulently listing an illegal $5,000 
campaign contribution to the Hoffa campaign as having been made by five 
individual members in order to conceal the illegality, and then perjuring 
himself during the investigation -- could have made the difference in the 
Southern Region election, which Potter won by only 1,002 votes, less than 2 
percent of the total. Moreover, Conboy ruled that rank-and-file Teamster members 
-- not the same officials who benefitted by Potter’s wrongdoing -- should choose 
who they want to represent them as Southern Vice President.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the remainder of the decision, Conboy upheld the remainder of the rerun 
election and authorized the certification of the other winners. However, he 
ordered that his decision be stayed until the expiration of the two-week time 
period to appeal to United States District Judge David N. Edelstein.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Throughout the government-supervised Teamster elections beginning in 1990, 
Levy and the Litigation Group have represented hundreds of Teamster members, as 
well as Teamsters for a Democratic Union, in the courts and before the 
court-appointed election officials.</font></P>
