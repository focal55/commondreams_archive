        - February 17 - </font>One of America's best-known environmental organizations is going into the 
history books, by going into the global radio business.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Zero24-7 Web Radio, which formally launches this month, is a
service of 
Zero Population Growth (ZPG) -- America's premier non-profit environmental 
organization working to educate people about the impact of rapid population 
growth.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">ZPG in the radio business makes perfect sense to Zero24-7's new
Program 
Director, BBC veteran Mark Daley: &quot;If a fridge company can bring the 
world NBC, then there's no reason why an environmental organization can't 
bring the world a Web-based radio station.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Zero24-7 is the world's first global radio station working to
create a 
better broadcasting environment for Independent-Alternative music and 
programs, while working for a greener environment for the world. It's also 
one of the first Web-based radio stations to be programmed by professional 
broadcasters. And as Zero24-7 uses state-of-the-art technology to 
&quot;transmit&quot; or stream its signal, an infinite number of people can 
&quot;tune in&quot; freely via their computers to a high-quality digital 
stereo broadcast.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You don't need to be a rocket scientist to realize that many
people 
all over the country are disgusted with the fast-food attitude of mainstream 
radio. They want something that feels more like their favorite restaurant. 
These radio refugees are sick of hearing mountains of commercials, the same 
songs over and over again and some public affairs shows that are the audio 
equivalent of watching paint dry. People want new, creative programming. And 
that's what Zero24-7 aims to do,&quot; Daley says.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Zero24-7 has a clear and progressive mission to:</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Provide an accessible channel for quality commercial-free
eclectic 
music, thought-provoking guests, innovative programs and progressive 
opinion.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Establish a venue for Progressive issues, artists, people and
communities who are often overlooked by the mainstream media.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Educate millions more people about the joys of listening to
quality 
music and programming on the Internet.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">-- Promote a more diverse world where there's zero tolerance of
discrimination, bigotry and violence.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Joining Zero24-7's webolution is easy: Listeners need a computer
with a 
sound card, speakers and a free G2 Real Player which can be downloaded at <A 
href="http://www.Zero24-7.org">www.Zero24-7.org.</A> 
</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Zero24-7's first few weeks of life will introduce listeners to the
amazing range of music they can always expect to hear on the station. In 
the next few months, listeners can look forward to a similarly eclectic 
range of programs being added -- which include several radio firsts.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Hasn't Progressive music and 'making a difference' always been
the 
perfect partnership for change? It's sort of natural that a Progressive 
organization dedicated to improving people's lives would be dedicated to 
improving people's listening experience. We're also about three or four 
clicks away from a webcasting revolution where millions more people will be 
using their computers to listen to the radio and watch television. So it's 
brilliant to be a web-olutionary,&quot; Daley says. <BR>------ <BR>Photo and 
Television Opportunities <BR>Zero24-7's Washington, D.C.-based digital studios 
are state-of-the-art and great for pics and video. <BR>-- <BR>Note to 
Editors</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Mark Daley, Program Director <BR>Daley may be ZPG's national media relations 
manager, but he's no stranger to radio on both sides of the Atlantic. Under 
the tutelage of Ireland's &quot;Godfather of Punk&quot; Terri Hooley -- the 
man who discovered legendary DJ John Peel's all-time favorite band, The Undertones -- Daley cut his teeth as an award-winning radio
producer, DJ, journalist and publicist in the thick of Northern Ireland's Troubles, and up to his ears in Belfast's seminal Independent music
scene. Daley's resume reflects what he says is an &quot;equal passion&quot; 
for Independent-Alternative music and arts, Progressive politics and social justice, with stints at the UK Labour Party, the BBC in London
and modern rock giant WHFS in Washington, D.C. He is the recipient of several prestigious industry awards.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Jonathan &quot;Weasel&quot; Gilbert, Music Director <BR>With nearly 30 years 
in the business, Weasel is a legend on and off the air in Washington, D.C., 
being one of the creative founders and music directors of the nationally 
renowned progressive WHFS. Artists as diverse as Bruce Springsteen, Muddy 
Waters, Cyndi Lauper, The Dead Kennedys and Tori Amos got their start with 
Weasel. His interview list reads like a musical who's who: John Lennon, Joan Armatrading and Elvis Costello to name only three. He is the
recipient 
of numerous industry awards and critical acclaim, including being named one 
of the best afternoon DJs by the prestigious Washingtonian magazine on 
several occasions. He is one of the most respected figures in U.S. radio. 
He's the DJs' DJ.</font>
