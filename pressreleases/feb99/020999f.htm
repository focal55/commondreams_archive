      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - February 9 - </font>In stark contrast to their rhetorical commitment to
        "put the people's business first" by dealing with Social Security, education, HMO reform and other issues at the top of the American public's
        priority list, the new leaders of the House of Representatives have made a
        pro-corporate, anti-consumer "blast from the past" their first order of business in 1999, Public Citizen said today.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Speaker Hastert apparently is eager to reward corporate special interests
for their campaign contributions," said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.  "The first major piece of legislation in this Congress is a
special deal for business that undercuts consumers, public health and safety, and the environment. Having paid the piper, Big Business is now
calling the tune by claiming first place on the legislative agenda."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Corporations belonging to Alliance USA, a coalition that pushed the roll
back of regulatory protections in the 105th Congress, gave $45.7 million in campaign contributions to members of Congress and more than $8.8 million in
unregulated soft money to the political parties during the two years leading up to the 1998 elections.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Scheduled for House floor  action Wednesday, February 10th, are two
retreads from the 1994 Contract with America's campaign against government safeguards:</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">H.R. 350 creates a procedural roadblock to throw in the path of
legislative proposals designed to strengthen public health, safety and environmental protections.  The "point of order" it allows against private
sector mandates costing more than $100 million annually also could be used to derail a minimum wage increase or tough managed care reforms.  H.R. 350
would let members of Congress hide behind an undemocratic procedural motion instead of voting up or down, on their merits, on measures of critical
significance to the American people.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">H.R. 391 lets first-time violators of any record-keeping or reporting
requirement automatically off with no penalty -- an invitation to scofflaw companies to ignore paperwork that is vital to pollution control, food
safety, nursing home fraud and abuse and other vital public protections.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">H.R. 391 is ostensibly just for "small businesses," but it covers firms with
up to 500 employees, and in some cases, up to 1500.  It ostensibly exempts violations that result in actual, serious harm to the public, but its
exemption process is completely unworkable.  Its fundamental flaw: Ignoring the fact that the purpose of accurate, complete reporting and record-keeping
is to prevent harm before it occurs.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Speaker Hastert is starting out with an agenda that is as out of touch
with the priorities of the American people as Speaker Gingrich's," Claybrook said. "Poll after poll shows that Americans want the government to take
strong action to make our drinking water and air quality healthier, to ensure the safety of our nation's food supply and to protect nursing home
residents from abuse and U.S. taxpayers from Medicaid and Medicare fraud.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Apparently the Hastert team is afraid to risk rising to the challenge of
dealing with Social Security, HMO reform and education.  But how much longer do they think they can get away with taking care of  business for their
corporate special-interest backers instead of the people's business?"</font></P>
