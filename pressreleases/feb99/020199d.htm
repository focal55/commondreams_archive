        - February 1 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">A medical delegation sent to Iraq by the American Friends Service Committee 
found that eight years of sustained economic sanctions have had their severest 
impact on families and children there, producing a generation of young people 
weakened by disease, isolated from the outside world and left &quot;to feed on 
feelings of bitterness and injustice.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The delegation's report &quot;Child and Maternal Health and Nutrition in Iraq 
Under the Sanctions&quot; was released today following the group's visit to Iraq 
in November. The 20 -page document was drawn from reviews of UN reports, 
discussions with UN officials both in New York and in Baghdad, and interviews 
with physicians, government officials, professionals and lay people in Iraq. The 
delegation consisted of four pediatricians and one social worker, all of whom 
have worked in international health programs.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The consequences of the sanctions fall most heavily on children,&quot; 
the doctors noted in their report. &quot;While adults can endure long periods of 
hardship and privation, children's physiological immaturity and vulnerability 
provide them with less resistance. They are put at greater risk and are less 
likely to survive persistent shortages.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Among its conclusions, the delegation cited chronic malnutrition as the 
primary factor underlying the increased levels of mortality in young children. 
The group also found that economic hardship and unemployment has had a severe 
impact on families, which in turn has led to increased school absenteeism and a 
growing population of &quot;street children&quot; begging and doing small jobs.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The team stated that the public debate about Iraq has been clouded by 
political rhetoric which has obscured the humanitarian crisis. For example, the 
team cites American and UN public health experts who estimate that more than 
50,000 excess deaths occurred in Iraqi children under the age of 5 in 1997 
alone.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The purpose of this report is to direct public attention to the human 
consequences of the sanctions, so that rather than assigning blame, we can 
acknowledge the magnitude of the problem and direct our energies to dealing with 
it,&quot; the doctors wrote.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The medical delegation also found that the so-called intellectual embargo 
which among other things forbids the importation of medical journals has cut 
Iraqi health professionals off from recent scientific advances. This has 
seriously eroded the quality of health care in Iraq, the team said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report includes six recommendations urging the UN to re-evaluate the 
impact of sanctions. The team cited high infant mortality rates, an ailing 
infrastructure needing repair in order to adequately generate electricity, 
purify water pump sewage and maintain the health care system to reduce the 
frequency of infection and disease related to malnutrition. Finally the report 
calls for an end to the isolation of Iraqi civilians, including health 
professionals who have been cut off from the flow of scientific information and 
opportunities for training and continuing education.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is essential that we reopen communication with our Iraqi 
counterparts working in health, education and child welfare,&quot; the team 
wrote. &quot;The rebuilding of Iraq's health and educational institutions will 
take years, and would benefit from long-term and well-established ties with 
international organizations.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The delegation included the following children's health specialists:</font>

Public Health at Columbia University School of Public Health; Attending
