        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA
        - February 25 - </font>
        There is abundant and well documented information concerning the Indonesian
        instigated violence in East Timor. Gangs of youth, unemployed, common criminals and drug addicts as well as Indonesian Muslim extremists are
        armed and given money by  the authorities. Often, directly supported by soldiers , they launch murderous attacks against civilians in many parts of
        the country. Attacks have occurred in Turiskai, Same, Ainaro, Viqueque,
        Balibo, Atabae, Maubara, Liquica.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In spite of the fall of the dictator Suharto, and the positive
pronouncements by President BJ Habibie, old habits die hard. A culture of lies, deceit, arrogance, violence and corruption, deeply ingrained in
Indonesia, is also it's legacy in East Timor.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Even though the Republic is thoroughly bankrupt, the Indonesian authorities
are continuing the same policies of arrogance and violence against the people of East Timor, causing more suffering among our people and wasting
the scarce resources provided to them by the international community.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The World Bank, IMF, and the rich industrialized countries continue to
waste tax payers money to fund a country literally ruled by criminals.There are other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia more deserving of
international assistance.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Serbian ethnic cleansing in Bosnia pales by comparison with the savagery of
the Javanese in Catholic East Timor, Christian West Papua and Muslim Aceh.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Indonesian military have been directly implicated in the religious and
ethnic violence in recent past. Mob violence is planned by the military, sometimes directed at Christians and ethnic Chinese, and other times
directed at Muslims as it happened in Ambon and Kupang. A pattern of army instigated religious and ethnic violence is emerging not only in East Timor
but in many parts of Indonesia.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Suharto clique is directly implicated in destabilizing the entire
region with its ill gotten fortune. An international criminal court should be established to try
Suharto. His fortune stashed away overseas should be immediately frozen. An international warrant should be issued against
Suharto and his son-in-law Gen. Prabowo.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The East Timorese resistance has exercised utmost restraint since the fall
of the Suharto regime. But our patience is running out. We keep our options open as to our next course of action if the situation continues to
deteriorate.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Time and again, the East Timorese resistance leadership has proposed an end
to all armed activities in the territory. It has called for a permanent UN presence in the territory to monitor the situation. A UN peace keeping
mission in the territory is now a matter of urgency.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I have proposed the creation of a safe heaven in East Timor where
resistance fighters would assemble under international humanitarian protection. Indonesian troop presence should be scaled down and the
remaining forces confined to designated areas.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">All of the above has been rejected by the Indonesian side. Instead of
reducing the number of troops in territory as it has been urged by the UN Secretary-General,  US Administration, EU and Australia,  the Indonesian
authorities have increased the number of troops in the territory now numbering well over 20,000.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A militia of at least 1,000 criminals have been trained and armed to
terrorize the civilian population. Many of the these criminals are not native East Timorese but rather are radical Indonesian Islamic youth members.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We reject as blatant hypocrisy the latest "proposal" by the Indonesianmilitary commander in Dili that all armed groups should be disarmed - the
East Timorese Resistance Armed Forces (FALINTIL) and the gang of criminals - while the Indonesian army would remain intact in East Timor.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The FALINTIL is as legitimate an army as those armies of national
liberation that fought for independence in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe to mention a few.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Indonesian army is in the same role as the racist white South African
army in Namibia or the racist army of the white minority regime in Rhodesia. It is preposterous to say the least that such a gang of criminals
should pretend to be a neutral force between the FALINTIL and the armed gangs on Jakarta's payroll.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Jakarta has always underestimated the East Timorese capacity to resists. We
are determined to resist with all means at our disposal and we will not refrain from looking into means to increase the costs to Indonesia.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">I find it hard to swallow that a country so thoroughly mismanaged,
bankrupt, sunk under the weight of corruption and all sorts of crimes, a country so dependent on international hand-outs to feed its millions of
starving people, should aspire to the status of a colonial power.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Indonesia should leave by January 2000 as President Habibie desires. No
tears will be shed by the East Timorese people. When they finally leave, they will leave behind a country thoroughly destroyed, a society profoundly
traumatized by its 23 year savage colonization, a culture of violence, corruption and lies that were alien to the East Timorese traditional
society prior to 1975.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Beginning in January 2000, the UN should take over the Administration of
the territory for a period of up to five years. With Indonesia relinquishing its claims to the territory, the door is wide open for the UN
to move in and help prepare the territory for statehood.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The small group of "pro-Indonesia" elements should not fear an independent
East Timor. They will realize that in an independent East Timor they will be real citizens of a proud country. In Indonesia they have been and will
always be lackeys. Their own honor and self-esteem will be restored.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Doomsday comments about how East Timor would descend into civil war if the
Indonesian army were to suddenly leave is like suggesting that Jews would start killing each other if Hitler had not slaughtered them first. The same
doomsday scenarios were predicted by most commentators in regard to South Africa in the months preceding the establishment of black majority rule.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These patronizing and racist comments ignore the role of the Indonesian
army in East Timor in the last 23 years and the on-going campaign directly orchestrated by Jakarta to destabilize the territory.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Indonesian army is not the "stabilizing force" as some commentators
write. It could have been, it could be and it still has a chance to redeem
itself. But the reality is that far from being a element of stability and the glue of the country's unity, the Indonesian army is in fact the most
dangerous and destabilizing force in the archipelago.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Another argument is that East Timor is not viable economically. Is
Indonesia viable? Yes, it is, thanks to an IMF bail-out package of over US$40 billion. It is viable, thanks to a US$10 billion package offered by
tiny Singapore. It was viable as the World Bank, ignoring massive corruption and fraud, poured into Suharto's coffers more than US$20 billion
over the past 30 years.  East Timor will not need this amount of "generosity".</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Commentators refer to Indonesia's "billions" poured into East Timor. We
invite the Jakarta government to launch an audit into how these so-called "billions" were actually spent. We also would like an international audit
into the tens of millions of dollars looted from our people's wealth - our fine arabica coffee, sandal wood, marble, fisheries, that became monopolies
owned by the Suharto family and the generals who invaded East Timor.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">It would also be necessary to list the items carried away into ships
anchored off the Dili harbor during the first days of the invasion in 1975.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Refrigerators, cars, motorbikes, bed frames, mattresses and even doors and
windows were carted away by the Indonesian soldiers sent into East Timor to "liberate" East Timor, Genghis Khan style. Trucks and cars were driven away
into West Timor. The local Dili warehouse was emptied of millions of gallons of beer, wine, soft drinks, construction equipment.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The result of these audits would be most interesting indeed and would once
and for all discredit Jakarta's claims and of its apologists that Jakarta poured "billions" into East Timor!</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If any shame is left, if any sense of honor is there, if any sense of duty
to the Republic is felt by the military hierarchy, there is chance for them to show it, leave East Timor now without causing more suffering to our
people and shame to the Republic.</font></P>
