        FRANCISCO - February 25 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
Seniors, beware. That's the conclusion of an advance study of the National 
Medicare Commission's recommendations due out next month. The Commission is 
expected to propose raising the eligibility age for seniors to 67 and replacing 
the existing program with a voucher program.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This is absolutely the wrong prescription for Medicare,&quot; said the 
study's lead author, Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, a Professor of Family Medicine at 
UC San Francisco and a founder of the California Physicians Alliance (CaPA). 
&quot;Giving seniors coupons to try to buy private insurance is a prescription 
for massive confusion, fraud and abuse. Just a few months ago over 400,000 
seniors were dumped from private insurers. This is a proposal to funnel billions 
of taxpayer dollars into the coffers of HMOs, not protect health care for 
seniors.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The voucher proposal, or &quot;premium support&quot; plan as it is referred 
to by the commission, would increase out-of-pocket costs for the elderly, who 
already spend more than 20% of their incomes on health care, according to the 
study. The explanation is that the value of the vouchers falls over time, as 
health care costs rise faster than the value of the coupons.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Vouchers don't control costs, they shift them to sick people,&quot; 
noted senior health economist Dr. Edie Rasell, who is also a family 
practitioner.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Among the study's other findings:</font>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">HMOs have raised, not lowered, Medicare's costs as HMOs selectively recruit 
healthier seniors who have lower medical expenses. HMOs also have much higher 
administrative costs, CEO salaries, etc.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1998, Medicare's costs increased 1.5%, a rate lower than private 
insurance, and Medicare costs are expected to rise more slowly than private 
insurance through 2007.</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">There are quality problems with HMOs for the chronically ill and poor</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Seniors' health is more likely to decline in an HMO than in traditional 
Medicare</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">HMOs limit seniors' choice of physician and hospital</font> 
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Raising the eligibility age to 67 would create more than 1,750,000 newly 
uninsured</font>
<P></P></LI></UL><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The only way to genuinely control costs is to do the same 
thing other industrialized countries do (e.g. Sweden and Denmark) -- put young 
and old together into a universal health program with a global budget,&quot; 
said Rasell, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. &quot;Their 
populations are aging faster than ours and yet they have controlled their 
overall health spending, while ours continues to skyrocket.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Rasell also noted that Medicare should cover prescription drugs. 
&quot;Medication costs are a major burden for seniors. 79% of seniors have 
incomes under $25,000 a year and can't afford expensive medications. Medicare 
could get them at a big discount.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Raising the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 is a &quot;cruel trick,&quot; 
according to Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo, an internist and health services 
researcher at New York's Columbia Presbyterian. &quot;It would add millions to 
the ranks of the uninsured at a time in people's lives when they are starting to 
face age-related illnesses and unemployment. In the long run, it would just add 
to health costs as people try to put off pressing health needs until they are 
insured.&quot; Carrasquillo is the author of &quot;Going Bare,&quot; a recent 
study of the growing epidemic of uninsurance that appeared in the January issue 
of the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I>.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our number one goal in any Medicare reform must be to improve the 
quality of health care for seniors,&quot; said Dr. Christine Cassel, Chair of 
the Department of Geriatrics at Mt. Sinai Medicial Center in New York. &quot;It 
turns out that the best way to improve quality for seniors is also the best way 
to improve quality for the 45 million Americans who are uninsured and the over 
200 million Americans who are underinsured --<I>by creating a genuine national 
health system with coverage for long-term care.&quot;</I>
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This study will be, I hope, the nail in the coffin of pushing seniors 
into HMOs in the guise of &quot;saving Medicare,&quot; said Dr. Quentin Young, 
Past President of the American Public Health Association and National 
Coordinator of Physicians for a National Health Program. The best solution to 
the Medicare crisis is a not-for-profit, single payer national health program 
for all Americans.&quot;</font>
