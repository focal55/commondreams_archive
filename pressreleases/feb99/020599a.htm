        YORK CITY - February 5 -
Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Gloria Feldt has been 
appointed to the official U.S. Delegation to the Hague International Forum 
February 8-12 in the Netherlands. Feldt is one of four NGO representatives 
appointed to the 12-member delegation and the only delegate whose organization 
provides family planning services in the U.S. The U.S. delegation will meet with 
representatives from 180 nations to review global progress made since the 1994 
International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt. 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is the honorary head of the delegation and 
will address the Opening Session Feb. 8.<BR><BR>At the 1994 ICPD, the U.S. was 
among the 179 nations that adopted the ICPD Program of Action, a 20-year plan to 
promote sustainable, human-centered development and a stable 
population—including a call for universal access to reproductive health 
information and services. As a member of the delegation, Feldt will participate 
in meetings to assess progress since the 1994 meeting, share best practices and 
produce practical recommendations on meeting the goals established in Cairo five 
years ago.<BR><BR>&quot;Because of attacks on family planning by religious 
political extremists in the U.S. Congress, countless women worldwide lack, and 
millions more may lose, their lifesaving ability to plan and space their 
children,&quot; Feldt said. &quot;It's time Congress lived up to the commitments 
the U.S. made in Cairo—to ensure access to preventive measures that reduce the 
number of unplanned pregnancies and save women's lives. As the leading provider 
of reproductive health care in the U.S. and a member of the international 
sustainable development community, Planned Parenthood is committed to seeing 
that access to family planning and reproductive health care is a reality for 
women around the world.&quot;<BR><BR>The Hague Forum will be preceded by both an 
NGO Forum and a Youth Forum (Feb. 6 and 7). As the largest single generation of 
young people in history, today's youth are major proponents and will be the 
primary benefactors of a worldwide commitment to the ICPD Program of Action. The 
Youth Forum will bring young people from around the world to the table to 
discuss developments since Cairo and to propose future actions related to the 
health, empowerment and individual development of young people. <BR><BR>Planned 
Parenthood has always recognized the importance of serving young people and 
giving them the tools to make responsible choices about their reproductive and 
sexual lives.<BR><BR>&quot;Young people have the most to gain and contribute to 
the goals set in Cairo,&quot; Feldt said. &quot;What they do today, from 
recycling a soda can to practicing safer sex, directly affects their lives and 
the future of the planet.&quot;<BR><BR>As president of Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America, Feldt oversees the world's oldest and largest voluntary 
reproductive health care organization, comprised of 133 affiliates that operate 
900 health centers nationwide, serving nearly five million Americans annually. 
PPFA's international service division, Family Planning International Assistance, 
provides supplies and technical assistance to family planning projects in the 
developing world. Global Partnerships, PPFA's new advocacy initiative, links 
Planned Parenthood affiliates with family planning and advocacy groups around 
the globe.</font>
