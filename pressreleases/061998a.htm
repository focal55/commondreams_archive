<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  
-  June 19&nbsp; -- Nine former leaders of the American Civil
    Liberties Union (ACLU) today publicly released a joint statement declaring that the
    current ACLU leadership has misread the First Amendment as it applies to campaign finance
    laws and that significant campaign finance reform -- including a soft money ban -- is
    constitutional.<br>
    <br>
    The nine former leaders constitute every living person to have served as ACLU president,
    executive director, legal director or legislative director during the past 30 years,
    except for one person currently in government service, and therefore, not free to express
    a personal opinion.<br>
    <br>
    In their statement the former ACLU leaders called for the overturning of Buckley v. Valeo,
    the landmark Supreme Court campaign finance case, and stated that even within the
    limitations of Buckley, Congress can eliminate the soft money loophole and regulate
    so-called &quot;issue advocacy&quot; advertisements.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;While I am proud of my ACLU service and continue to support the ACLU's matchless
    efforts to preserve the Bill of Rights, I believe the national ACLU's position on campaign
    finance reform is wrong on constitutional and policy grounds,&quot; stated Burt Neuborne,
    currently the legal director of the Brennan Center
    and formerly the national legal director of the ACLU. &quot;Opponents of reform should no
    longer be permitted to hide behind a constitutional smokescreen.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Opponents of campaign finance reform have routinely invoked the ACLU as the authority for
    the argument that efforts to reform campaign finance laws are unconstitutional. Most
    importantly for the current House debate is the statement's forceful rejection of the
    ACLU's argument that the Supreme Court's rulings block banning soft money and regulating
    so-called &quot;issue advertisements&quot; -- the key components of Shays-Meehan
    legislation.<br>
    <br>
    The Brennan Center for Justice is a nonprofit institute devoted to discourse and action on
    issues of justice central to the jurisprudence of the late Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
    Founded three years ago by family members, friends and former clerks, the center is
    involved in litigation, public education and scholarship
    on campaign finance reform.<br>

    A copy of the statement follows.<br>
    -------<br>
    Statement of Persons Who Have Served the
    American Civil Liberties Union in Leadership Positions
    Supporting the Constitutionality of Efforts to Enact
    Reasonable Campaign Finance Reform<br>
    <br>
    We have served the American Civil Liberties Union in leadership
    positions over several decades. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Norman Dorsen served as ACLU
    general counsel from 1969-1976 and as president of the ACLU from
    1976-1991. Jack Pemberton and Aryeh Neier served as executive
    directors of the ACLU from 1962-1978. Melvin Wulf, Bruce Ennis,
    Burt Neuborne, and John Powell served as national legal directors
    of the ACLU from 1962-1992. Charles Morgan Jr., and Morton
    Halperin served as national legislative directors of the ACLU from
    1972-1976, and 1984-1992 respectively. Indeed, except for one
    person currently in government service, and, therefore, not free
    to express a personal opinion, we constitute every living person
    to have served as ACLU president, ACLU executive director, ACLU
    legal director, or ACLU legislative director during the past
    30 years, with the exception of the current leadership.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    We have devoted much of our professional lives to the ACLU, and
    to the protection of free speech. We are proud of our ACLU
    service, and we continue to support the ACLU's matchless efforts to
    preserve the Bill of Rights. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have come to believe, however,
    that the opposition to campaign finance reform expressed by the
    ACLU misreads the First Amendment. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our opinion, the First
    Amendment does not forbid content-neutral efforts to place
    reasonable limits on campaign spending.
    We believe that the First Amendment is designed to safeguard a
    functioning and fair democracy. The current system of campaign
    financing makes a mockery of that ideal by enabling the rich to set
    the national agenda, and to exercise disproportionate influence
    over the behavior of public officials.
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We believe that Buckley v. Valeo, the 1976 Supreme Court case
    that makes it extremely difficult to reform the current, disastrous
    campaign financing system, should be overruled for three reasons.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, the Buckley opinion inappropriately treats the spending of
    money as though it were pure speech, no matter how high the
    spending limits may be. But such an approach ignores the long-
    established Supreme Court rule that when speech is inextricably
    intertwined with conduct, the conduct may be regulated if it
    threatens to cause serious harm. While we agree that unreasonably
    low spending limits would unconstitutionally impinge on free
    speech, the Buckley Court failed to recognize that there is a
    compelling interest in defending democracy that justifies
    reasonable spending limits. Reasonable spending limits would free
    candidates and officials to concentrate on substantive questions of
    public policy, instead of spending excessive time raising campaign
    funds. Reasonable spending limits would also free candidates from
    becoming trapped in an arms race mentality, where each candidate is
    forced to continue raising money, not because they wish to, but to
    prevent being outspent by an opponent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Second, the Buckley opinion makes an untenable distinction
    between campaign contributions, which may be subjected to stringent
    government regulation, and campaign expenditures, which are
    virtually immune from regulation. The bright-line distinction
    between contributions and expenditures is neither analytically nor
    pragmatically defensible. By upholding limits on the size and
    source of campaign contributions, while preventing any effort to
    limit the demand for campaign funds by capping spending, the
    Buckley Court inadvertently created a system that tempts
    politicians to break the law governing campaign contributions in
    order to satisfy an uncontrollable need for campaign cash.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Third, the Buckley Court erred in refusing to permit the
    establishment of reasonable spending limits designed to avoid
    unfair domination of the electoral process by a small group of
    extremely wealthy persons. Instead of &quot;one person - one vote,&quot; the
    Buckley decision has resulted in a regime of &quot;one dollar - one
    vote&quot; that magnifies the political influence of extremely wealthy
    individuals and distorts the fundamental principle of political
    equality underlying the First Amendment itself, causing great harm
    to the democratic principles that underlie the Constitution.
    </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is our hope that the current Supreme Court, confronted with
    the unfortunate practical implications of the Buckley decision, and
    the serious flaws in its constitutional analysis, will reconsider
    the decision, and permit reasonable legislative efforts to reform
    our campaign financing system.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Moreover, even within the limitations of the Buckley decision,
    we believe that significant campaign finance reform is both
    possible and constitutional. We support elimination of the &quot;soft
    money&quot; loophole that allows unlimited campaign contributions to
    political parties, undermining Congress' effort to regulate the
    size and source of campaign contributions to candidates. We
    believe that Congress, for the purpose of regulating the size and
    source of federal campaign contributions, may treat a contribution
    to the political party sponsoring a federal candidate as though it
    were a contribution to the candidate directly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also support regulation of the funding of political
    advertising that is clearly intended to affect the outcome of a
    specific federal election, but that omits the magic words &quot;vote
    for&quot; or &quot;vote against.&quot; We believe that Congress may draft a
    narrowly tailored provision regulating the funding of so-called
    &quot;issue advertisements&quot; that mention one or more of the candidates,
    appear shortly before the election, and are geographically targeted
    in an obvious effort to affect the outcome of a specific federal
    election.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    We believe that the current debate over campaign financing
    reform in the House of Representatives and the Senate should center
    on the important policy questions raised by various efforts at
    reform. Opponents of reform should no longer be permitted to hide
    behind an unjustified constitutional smokescreen.<br>
