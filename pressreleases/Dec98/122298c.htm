        - December 22 - </font>While former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet continues to face the possibility of prosecution in
        Spain for human-rights abuses, a former high official in his regime is the subject of growing controversy in Washington.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     An article published Tuesday (Dec. 22) in Investor's
Business Daily condemns Jose Pinera's role in Chile and raises questions about his current relationship with the Cato Institute,
a prominent Washington think tank.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     "It strains credulity why top officials at that well-heeled
organization have continued to embrace" Pinera, says the newspaper article, which was written by the directors of two U.S.
organizations, the Council on Hemispheric Affairs and the Institute for Public Accuracy.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Pinera, currently co-chair of the Cato Institute's Project
on Social Security Privatization, was Chile's Minister of Labor and Social Security from 1978 to 1980.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Noting that today &quot;Pinera is a Cato luminary," the article
says that while he worked as a top official in the Chilean dictatorship, "Chile was under Pinochet's boot, with the
legislature having been shuttered and laws made by decree."</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human-rights groups have documented that the Pinochet regime
engaged in widespread political imprisonments, torture and murder. "The fact that Cato even hired Pinera is a puzzlement,"
the article comments, given that "at the heart of its ideological prattle are heated professions against intrusive government, the
definition of which presumably doesn't include torture."</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     After the 1973 coup, which overthrew a democratically
elected government, Chile privatized its pension system. In recent years, officials at the Cato Institute and other advocates
of privatizing Social Security in the United States have cited Chile as a model.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial" size="2">REALITIES OF PINOCHET'S PAST</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">By Larry Birns &amp; Norman Solomon</font></P>
<P> </P>
        </FONT>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     With the bitter market collapse in Southern Asia, all of us
-- certainly investors -- must be mindful that a poor human rights record isn't necessarily a boon for business.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Meanwhile, internationally distinguished figures with solid
democratic credentials have applauded the arrest and detention of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, a world-class human rights abuser.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     But for some, privatization has become a philosopher's
stone. From their perspective, those who advance it are miracle makers -- while those who challenge it by pointing to social
justice shortfalls are scornfully dismissed as neo-Luddites.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">When the "Chicago Boys" served in the Pinochet regime,
writes Paul Craig Roberts in IBD (Viewpoint, Dec. 9), they "made Chile the role model for Latin America."</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Formerly a fellow with the Cato Institute in Washington,
Roberts dismisses Pinochet's brutalities as being a small enough piece of jade to pay to advance the free market and oust the
Marxists.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     But only those most bereft of an understanding of the
Pinochet period, or bored by the democratic ethos, can blunt the grisly realities gripping Chile throughout the Pinochet era,
beginning on Sept. 11, 1973. When it comes to that dictatorship, no grays were involved.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Not that Roberts hasn't attempted to manufacture them by
claiming that the world's odium has been "falsely" directed at his hero because Pinochet had the temerity to put down "a
communist-led terrorist insurrection." In fact, no such insurrection ever occurred.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     In fact, Roberts' analysis has been repudiated by
international mainstream news organizations. Consider the London Sunday Times, no bible of collectivism. The paper noted in
October that 3,197 people "were murdered for political reasons" by Pinochet's dictatorship "and more than 1,000 are still
unaccounted for. Tens of thousands were imprisoned or exiled, but often Pinochet's assassins would follow them."</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     One of the people they followed was a young Christian
Scientist, Charles Horman (portrayed in the film "Missing"), who was detained and then murdered in Santiago, apparently for seeing
too much.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Pinochet's contract killers also went to Washington. In '76,
they blew up a car carrying the country's exiled former defense minister, Orlando
Letelier, just a few blocks from the White House.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Roberts' spirited defense of Pinochet also extends to Jose
Pinera -- who now co-chairs the Cato Institute's Project on Social Security Privatization. It strains credulity why top
officials at that well-heeled organization have continued to embrace the Chilean technocrat.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Roberts praises Pinera, who served as Chile's labor minister
from '78 to '80, during a period of unremitting oppression of workers in that country.
Pinera is a Cato luminary, with its annual report stating that he "oversaw the privatization of Chile's pension system in
the early 1980s." But the publication doesn't mention that during his service, Chile was under Pinochet's boot, with the
legislature having been shuttered and laws made by decree.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     The fact that Cato even hired Pinera is a puzzlement. At the
heart of its ideological prattle are heated professions against intrusive government, the definition of which presumably doesn't
include torture.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Roberts apparently has misidentified his readers' primary
allegiance, which is not only to profits, but to their public role as citizens. Americans almost instinctively repudiate a
brutal regime that bloodily ousts a democratically elected government.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Doesn't torture matter? Are imprisonments and political
murders mere details to be denied in favor of brisk commerce?</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     Despite the inaccurate public relations Chile enjoys as "the
hemisphere's most perfected democracy" and Latin America's "economic miracle," it is little better than a "guided democracy"
under military surveillance. Awash with great wealth in the hands of a few, the country has one of the most concentrated financial
patterns in all of Latin America, while one-third of all Chileans live at or below the poverty line.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">     The fact that only a handful of individuals have been
jailed, despite the thousands of innocents slaughtered by the regime, is a testament to the magnitude of injustice spawned by
Pinochet and the unlikeliness that if returned to Chile he would ever be tried. What Roberts has attempted is to conjure up a
false history.</font></P>

Washington, D.C. Norman Solomon is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy in San Francisco.</font></P>
