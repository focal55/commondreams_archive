        - December 23 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Congressional Republicans took $12.7 million from alcohol, gambling, tobacco and 
firearm interests in the 1998 election cycle - dollars that were used to attack 
family values, according to a <A href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/reform/killer.htm">report</A> 
released by Public Citizen today.</font>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial"> In a story in the current issue of Public
Citizen 
News titled &quot;Family Values, Killer Industries,&quot; Public Citizen 
tied campaign contributions from dozens of &quot;anti-family&quot; PACs and 
individuals to defeated bills that would have protected American families from 
deaths and injuries.</font></P>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial"> In all, these four killer industries handed out $18.1 
million to members of Congress in the 1997-1998 election cycle, successfully 
killing proposals that would have strengthened drunk driving standards, held 
adult owners legally responsible for failing to lock guns away from children, 
penalized Big Tobacco for marketing to children, and funded minority school 
scholarships by ending a massive pro-gambling tax break.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> &quot;Too many Congressional leaders pose as the protectors of family 
values while taking money from these anti-family special interests,&quot; said 
Joan Claybrook, President of Public Citizen. &quot;This Congress is catering to 
killer industries.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> &quot;It rejected a national tobacco control bill, defeated national 
drunk driving standards, blocked important gun controls, and halted repeal of 
the gambling tax deduction. Family values were shredded.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> Among the findings cited in the article:</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> <STRONG>*</STRONG>Republicans vacuumed up 70 percent of 
the $18.1 million contributed by the four industries. Of the total, $11.2 million was unregulated &quot;soft money&quot; and $6.9 
million was from PACs.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>*Big Tobacco</B> was the fifth leading &quot;soft money&quot; industry 
giver to the Republican Party, lavishing $3.9 million on the GOP. It also gave 
individual candidates $2.1 million in PAC money - 71 percent to Republicans. A 
Public Citizen study of 14 Senate tobacco-control votes in the 105<SUP>th</SUP> 
Congress found 34 senators who voted with Big Tobacco most of the time received 
seven times as much in tobacco PAC contributions as the 40 senators who voted 
with consumers most of the time.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>*Beer, wine and liquor</B> industries handed out $2.2 million in 
&quot;soft money&quot; - about evenly split between the GOP and Democrats. But 
74 percent of the alcohol industry’s $2.2 million in direct PAC contributions to 
candidates went to Republicans. Result: The industry’s friends in the House 
prevented a vote on a .08 percent blood-alcohol level passed by the Senate, and 
stopped it from being adopted in conference.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>*Firearms</B> groups like the National Rifle Association, ignoring a spate 
of high-profile school shootings, spent nearly $2 million in PAC and soft money 
contributions (84 percent to Republicans) to help turn aside an amendment that 
would have held adult gun owners legally responsible for failing to lock their 
guns away from children.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>*Gambling</B> groups chipped in, too, as Mirage Resorts gave the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) $250,000 - the third largest &quot;soft 
money&quot; check written during the 1997-98 election cycle. Thanks to that and 
a fall 1997 American Gaming Association fund raiser, where former Republican 
National Committee chairman Frank Fahrenkopf gave Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott (R-Miss.) $100,000 for his Republican senatorial committee, the gambling 
industry downed an amendment that would have repealed a tax deduction for 
gambling losses to pay for education scholarships to low-income children. 
Overall, Big Gambling made $4.9 million in PAC and &quot;soft money&quot; 
contributions in the period - 58 percent to the GOP.</font></P>
