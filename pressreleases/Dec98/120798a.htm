        NEW CALEDONIA - December 7 - </font>After more than 14 hours Greenpeace activists are continuing their peaceful 
protest to prevent the departure of the Japanese whale catcher Kyo Maru No 1 and 
the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru from the port of Noumea in New Caledonia.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">After 14 hours the activist on the anchor chain of the Kyo Maru No 1 was 
replaced with a second activist. After this occurred, the crew of the Kyo Maru 
No 1 turned a water hose on the new protester, and began lowering the anchor 
chain to the water line, recklessly endangering the protester.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">At present, the activist is unharmed but the crew have now turned a spotlight 
on him . The anchor is now just on the water line. There is a safety boat in 
attendance.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Letters have been sent by Greenpeace offices around the world demanding the 
Japanese authorities guarantee that the fleet will not head back to the Southern 
Ocean Whale Sanctuary to resume whale hunting.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Just before dawn two Greenpeace climbers occupied the anchor chain and the 
harpoon of the Kyo Maru No 1. Another two climbers occupied the mooring lines 
between the Nisshin Maru and the dock. They hung a banner stating &quot;Stop 
Killing Whales&quot;. Later in the morning divers tied steel chains around the 
propeller of the Kyo Maru, stopping it from being able to depart.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the afternoon, local activists joined the protest on the wharf of
Noumea. 
They have protested the whaling ships since their arrival in New Caledonia last 
week.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Whales need global sanctuaries, not hunting,&quot; said John Frizell of 
Greenpeace. &quot;Since 1994, Japan has consistently ignored the internationally
recognized Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and continued to hunt whales in this 
protected area to supply their market with whale meat. This outrageous practice 
must be abandoned immediately&quot;.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Kyodo Senpaku, the owners of the Kyo Maru No 1, and the Japanese Fisheries 
Agency announced last week that the catcher boat, together with two other whale 
catchers, will resume whale hunting in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary early in the 
new year, as soon as its damaged factory ship, the Nisshin Maru can be repaired. 
The Nisshin Maru was crippled by a fire, which burned for several days, leaving 
the vessel unable to move. It was towed to the French territory of New Caledonia 
for initial repairs.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Japan has stepped up its efforts to resume full-scale commercial whaling in 
the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, despite the fact that is was made 
into an international sanctuary for whales in 1994 by the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC), following a proposal by France, forbidding all commercial 
whaling in the area. Japan was the only member of the IWC to vote against the 
Antarctic whale sanctuary. France has consistently opposed Japan's whaling in 
the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Japanese officials claim that the Antarctic whale hunt is for scientific 
research but every year the whale meat is sold on the open market for tens of 
millions of dollars. The 1700 tons of whale meat from last year's 
&quot;research&quot; hunt sold in Japanese fish markets for an estimated US$ 50 
million.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;To call this scientific research is an insult to science,&quot; said
Frizell. &quot;There is no need to kill whales to study them. We have been 
campaigning against whaling for 25 years and we remain committed to ensuring 
that commercial whaling draped in the cloak of &quot;science&quot; is 
stopped&quot;.</font> </P>
