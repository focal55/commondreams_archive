        - December 22 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Warning that the next sea shipment of highly radioactive waste may be 
departing soon, the Nuclear Control Institute and Greenpeace International today 
made public <A href="http://www.nci.org/pcc-2-98.htm">an internal Panama Canal Commission memo</A> 
that documents a major security breach involving a nuclear waste ship in the 
canal earlier this year.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In <A href="http://www.nci.org/mox11698.htm">letters to the U.S. Secretaries of State, Defense 
and Energy</A>, the two organizations called for barring nuclear cargo ships 
from the canal until the U.S. government investigates and corrects the serious 
breakdown in security that occurred in February when the Pacific Swan, en route 
from Europe to Japan with a cargo of highly radioactive nuclear waste, entered 
the canal.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Panama Canal Commission (PCC) memo, obtained through a Freedom of 
Information Act request, found that &quot;communication, command and 
control...was dysfunctional&quot; when Greenpeace protesters easily boarded the 
nuclear-waste ship as it entered the Canal and hung a &quot;Stop Plutonium&quot; 
banner from the radio mast. The report noted that patrol boats had failed to 
spot the Greenpeace launch and that the ship's crew had thought the 
demonstrators to be security personnel boarding the ship.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Had the ship been boarded by a group of well-armed attackers instead of 
peaceful demonstrators, its cargo would have been in grave jeopardy, with 
potentially catastrophic consequences for the people of Panama,&quot; Greenpeace 
and NCI declared in their letter to the Cabinet secretaries. &quot;Given the 
shippers' frequently professed concerns about security, we were astonished to 
discover how thoroughly inept and ineffective were the security arrangements at 
the Panama Canal. In fact, essential elements of the security system did not 
work.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, said, &quot;Since 
the next waste shipment could be sent at any time, the U.S. government should 
stop dragging its feet and respond to our November 6 letter by banning nuclear 
shipments through the Panama Canal. Governments in the Caribbean and the Pacific 
should immediately express concern to the U.S., French, British and Japanese 
governments about the vulnerability of the nuclear transport vessels. They 
should also take steps to restrict transit of nuclear cargo ships through their 
territorial waters.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The two groups sent the letters to the U.S. Government on November 6 but have 
not yet received a reply. However, they learned in discussions with the State 
Department that a Panama Canal route has not been ruled out either for the next 
shipment of high-level waste, which is due to take place soon, or for a shipment 
of plutonium-uranium, mixed-oxide [MOX] fuel, which is expected to depart from 
Europe next spring.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In their letter, they cited a security study by Sandia National Laboratories 
relating to vitrified (glassified) nuclear waste cargoes like the one aboard the 
Pacific Swan, and they warned that sabotage attack could result in &quot;both 
the sinking of the ship and the dispersal of deadly radioactive material over a 
large area.&quot; If MOX fuel (known in Japan as &quot;pluthermal&quot; fuel) 
were seized or diverted, the weapon-usable plutonium contained in it could be 
extracted by straightforward chemical means, they also noted.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The February 1998 shipment, from France to Japan, was the first ever transit 
of vitrified high-level nuclear waste through the Panama Canal. The material is 
a by-product of reprocessing---the separation of weapon-usable plutonium from 
spent nuclear fuel from Japanese nuclear power reactors. The shipment was 
conducted without preparation of an environmental assessment by either the 
Panama Canal Commission or the shippers - British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), COGEMA 
of France and Japan Nuclear Fuels.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Japan Nuclear Fuels has announced that the next HLW shipment will consist of 
40 glass blocks of deadly vitrified nuclear waste and will occur before April 
1999. Over 3,000 highly radioactive glass logs are scheduled to be shipped from 
Europe to Japan in the coming years.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Tom Clements of the Greenpeace Nuclear Campaign cited the events of February 
1998 as &quot;an irrefutable demonstration of both the Canal's and ship's 
security vulnerabilities.&quot; He added: &quot;The shipment of this high-level 
waste not only presents a security and environmental risk but serves no energy 
purpose in Japan, although Japanese officials have misled states along shipping 
routes by stating that the shipments were needed for Japan's energy 
security.&quot; He also noted that the plutonium waste also faces only temporary 
storage in Japan as no long-term plan to manage high-level nuclear waste has 
been devised.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These shipments have raised concern in the Caribbean. The Caribbean High 
Commissioners expressed their concern in January 1998 at the &quot;great danger 
which [these shipments] pose to the fragile Caribbean environment and to the 
lives of Caribbean people.&quot; In April 1998, government leaders at the Second 
Summit of the Americas pledged &quot;to strengthen standards governing the 
transport of such goods.&quot; In September 1998, the Secretary General of 
OPANAL called for &quot;new and more comprehensive safety measures . . . for 
these increasingly dangerous nuclear shipments . . . including the appropriate 
safeguards, assurances, and liability measures.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Both NCI and Greenpeace advocate a halt to the reprocessing of Japan's spent 
nuclear fuel, including a ban on new reprocessing contracts with BNFL and COGEMA. Cessation of reprocessing and of fabrication of MOX fuel would permit a 
halt in maritime nuclear transports.</font> </P>

Incident,&quot; by the Panama Canal Commission's Director of Safety, Environment 
and Security, are available from Greenpeace and the Nuclear Control Institute or
