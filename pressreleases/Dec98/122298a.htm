        YORK - December 22 - </font>While most children around the country are celebrating the season's holidays at home with their families, this week
        hundreds of children in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
        Service (INS) will be spending Christmas in detention, separated from family
        and loved ones.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In a new report released today, Human Rights Watch charges the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) with violating the rights of unaccompanied
children in its custody. The report finds that roughly one third of detained children are held in punitive,
jail like detention centers, even though most children in INS custody are being detained for administrative reasons while
their case is pending, not as a punishment for criminal behavior.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Approximately 5000 unaccompanied children are detained by the INS each year.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch focused its report on a Pennsylvania facility that the INS
claims is one of the best in the country. However, the report found that too many children are locked up in
prison like conditions with juveniles accused of murder, rape and drug trafficking, where they are forbidden to speak their
native language, instructed not to laugh, and, according to several interviewees, even forced to ask permission to scratch their noses. Human
Rights Watch found that some children are strip searched and restrained by handcuffs during transport, and denied basic rights to privacy.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"These children have not been charged with any crime," says Jo Becker, an
author and researcher for the report. "Yet a significant number are being locked up in harsh,
prison like conditions where they are unable to communicate with anyone around them. Many don't understand what is happening to them, or
why."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report also charges the INS with failing to provide children with adequate
information about access to legal representation or their legal rights, and transferring children without the knowledge of their attorneys or families.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Many children are denied information about their detention or education in a
language that they can understand and may be confined for months at a time without direct access to a single person with whom they can converse in their
own languages.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch also charges that the INS has a troubling conflict of
interest, since children are subject to the enforcement of immigration laws by the same agency responsible for their care and protection. Human Rights Watch
urges the U.S. government to end this conflict of interest by assigning the caretaking function to an appropriate child welfare agency, which would have
custody of the child while the INS assesses their immigration status.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"These children are arrested, imprisoned and frequently deported, all by the
same agency that is charged with caring for them and protecting their legal rights," says Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights
Division of Human Rights Watch. "The U.S. government should assign the care of these children to an agency that will act in the best interest of the child."</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report, Detained and Deprived of Rights: Children in the Custody of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, is based on onsite visits and interviews conducted  at the Berks County Youth Center in Leesport,
Pennsylvania. An earlier Human Rights Watch investigation documented conditions of detention for children held by the INS in Arizona and California. Both
investigations found numerous violations of children's rights, in breach of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. statutory provisions, INS regulations, the terms of
court orders binding on the INS, and international law.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Human Rights Watch calls on U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner to ensure immediate and full compliance with all national laws and regulations as well as with internationals
standards concerning detention conditions for children. The organization also urges
that:</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*unaccompanied children awaiting determination of their status should not be
detained, except in rare instances to protect the safety of the child;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*the INS immediately cease to place unaccompanied children in state juvenile
justice or criminal   justice facilities, or in other facilities with prison like conditions;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*the US Congress should not charge the same agency with the care of
unaccompanied, undocumented children and also the enforcement of the immigration laws against them;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*all children in INS custody should have access to legal representation at
government expense;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*children should receive prompt, regular and thorough legal information in a
language they can understand</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">*the INS should provide a sufficient number of trained interpreters at
facilities housing unaccompanied children, as required by the shifting language populations in the facilities.</font></P>
