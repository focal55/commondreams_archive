        YORK - December 15 -
Bill Clinton and Tony Blair must take all possible steps to protect civilians 
from injury in the attack on Iraq, Human Rights Watch urged today.  
<BR><BR>Initial reports suggest that many potential targets are in urban areas, 
where the risk of civilian deaths and destruction is high. The laws of war 
require the United States to take all feasible precautions to avoid 
civilian casualties. Because the U.S. and British forces have 
precision-guided weapons in their arsenals, no unguided weapons should be 
used in attacks on urban areas. <BR><BR>“The burden is on Clinton and Blair 
to take extraordinary precautions in urban settings,” said Kenneth Roth, 
executive director of Human Rights Watch.  “No dumb bombs should be dropped 
on Baghdad, or other populated areas.”<BR><BR>The laws of war prohibit the 
destruction of objects that are indispensable to the survival of a civilian 
population. Roth noted that the attacks on the electrical system during the 
1991 Gulf  War produced massive civilian casualties and little military 
advantage. “The Gulf War bombing of Iraq’s electrical system is a good 
example of what must not happen again,” Roth said.<BR><BR>Since many of the 
alleged chemical and biological weapons sites are civilian facilities such as 
hospitals, fertilizer plants, breweries, and pharmaceutical and pesticide 
plants, the potential for deadly mistakes is high.  <BR><BR>“The 
decision to attack dual-use sites should be taken only after all efforts have 
been made to verify that the site is in fact being used for 
military purposes,” said Roth. “ Even then civilians on site should be given 
effective advance warning of an imminent attack.” The possible release of 
dangerous substances during an attack should also be weighed heavily, he 
said.<BR><BR>Human Rights Watch noted that in the past, the Iraqi government has 
used civilians to shield its military sites -- a flagrant violation 
of international humanitarian law on the part of Baghdad.  But such 
actions in no way diminish the separate obligation of the U.S. and the U.K. 
to avoid harm to civilians. “Knowing that shielding is a possibility, the 
American and British militaries should pay special attention to this 
obligation,” said Roth. “Advance warnings are imperative.”<BR><BR>In 
November, when U.S.-U.K. bombings seemed imminent, Human Rights Watch 
sent letters to Clinton and Blair urging them to take extra precautions to 
avoid civilian casualties in Iraq. <br>
        <BR>Although the U.S. and the U.K. have incorporated many 
international humanitarian law provisions into their military guidelines, the 
organization noted that allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War did not always 
fully comply with these requirements, as detailed in Human Rights Watch’s 
lengthy report, Needless Deaths in the Gulf War.  The organization called 
on both governments to put in place mechanisms to review continuously the 
selection of targets and the means and methods used to carry out attacks, and 
to ensure that possible violations of these standards are investigated 
immediately and vigorously. A prompt public accounting of the findings 
should be made, and appropriate disciplinary or prosecutorial measures should 
be taken against those found responsible for any breach. &nbsp; The 
organization also urged the U.S. and U.K., given their 
special responsibilities as parties to this conflict, to use their influence 
to persuade all countries bordering Iraq to accommodate any refugee 
flows resulting from an attack and to refrain from forcibly returning such 
people to Iraq.</font>
