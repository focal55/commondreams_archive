      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - December 7 -
Following is a statement by Common Cause President Ann McBride on Attorney
        General 
Reno's decision not to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to 
investigate campaign finance abuses:</font>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Attorney General Janet Reno today 
has taken a big step toward dismantling the federal election laws put into place 
after the Watergate scandals.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;While spending limits remain part of the 
presidential campaign finance law, the Attorney General's decision as a practical
        matter makes these limits largely meaningless because it approves a means of
evading those limits that is so easy and transparent that future candidates will 
now surely do the same.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;By refusing to seek the appointment of an 
independent counsel to investigate the massive violations of the campaign finance 
law that took place in the 1996 presidential election, the Attorney General has 
shirked her obligation to enforce that law so that those who violate it face real 
consequences.  Absent such enforcement, we can expect scandal and abuse in the 
2000 election that will make 1996look like child's play.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;By relying on 
statements by members of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for her decision, 
the Attorney General is aligning herself with the FEC -- known as the Failure to 
Enforce Commission --which has been notorious for its partisanship and its weak
        and ineffective enforcement of the election law.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Last week, the 
professional and nonpartisan auditors and lawyer sat the FEC found that the 
Clinton and Dole presidential campaigns in1996 engaged in an unprecedented scam 
to spend millions of dollars in violation of the presidential election spending 
limits. They did this by running multi-million dollar ad campaigns through their
        political parties as conduits.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Even though these ads were written, 
directed, targeted and controlled by the presidential campaigns, and even though 
the ads looked like campaign ads, the campaigns disingenuously treated them as 
so-called party &quot;issue ads.&quot; Under this scheme, according to the FEC 
staff, the Clinton campaign overspent a $30 million primary election spending 
limit by $46 million, and the Dole campaign spent $17 million outside the limits.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Further, much of the money used to pay for these ads came
        from sources -- 
such as corporations, labor unions or foreign nationals -- that are illegal under 
federal law, or was in amounts well over the federal contribution limits.  Thus, 
not only were the spending limits violated, but this scam was used to inject
millions of dollars of non-federal money into the presidential election.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;But the Attorney General has, in effect, approved what
        happened in 1996.  
In doing so, she has undermined the credibility and integrity of the election 
laws.  In 1996, the candidates ran roughshod over the law without facing any 
consequences. And now, because of the Attorney General's decision, we can be
        sure that candidates in the future will do so as well.&quot;</font></p>
