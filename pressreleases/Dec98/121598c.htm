    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - December 15 - </font>The following was released today by
    Essential Information:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Veteran investigative TV
    reporters Jane Akre and Steve Wilson, and academic independence advocate Professor David
    F. Noble will be presented the annual Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage by The
    Shafeek Nader Trust on Wednesday, Dec. 16.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Callaway award recognizes individuals who take a public
    stance to advance truth and justice, at some personal risk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hired by the Fox network affiliate Florida TV station WTVT
    in November 1996 to direct its &quot;news investigative unit,&quot; Akre and Wilson, a
    husband-wife team, were fired by the station about a year later for refusing to broadcast
    an inaccurate and deceptive version of their story on synthetic hormones in Florida's milk
    supply. In response Akre and Wilson filed a lawsuit charging (1) that WTVT violated its
    license from the Federal Communications Commission by insisting the reporters
    intentionally falsify information in their series on the genetically engineered
    recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a Monsanto (NYSE: MTC) product; and (2) that
    WTVT violated Florida's &quot;whistleblower&quot; law. The case is especially revealing of
    the pressures brought by a powerful corporation, Monsanto in this case, on a news
    organization. The story is compelling and available because Akre and Wilson refused to be
    cowed and instead fought back, informing the public about what transpires behind the news
    desk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For more than 20 years, Professor David F. Noble of York
    University in Toronto, Canada, has blown the whistle on the insidious corporate take-over
    of the university. As researcher, advocate, strategist and organizer, Noble has focused a
    laser-like beam on the hijacking of higher education in North America. His trenchant
    analyses have covered the contracts and collaborative arrangements between universities
    and business, which turn scientific knowledge into a commodity and researchers into
    corporate academics, and more recently he has highlighted the universities as
    &quot;digital diploma mills&quot; where on-line courses are mandated by an
    administration's policy that would sideline professors and abandon students to the
    computer as content provider, severing them from the university's educational mission. His
    has been a singular voice in seeking to fight the commercialization of higher education
    and to protect one of society's most precious assets, an independent intellectual capacity
    to engage the serious issues of our day. In an ever more specialized world, Noble's
    perspective as a social historian offers a valuable contextual framework for assessing the
    precarious condition of contemporary universities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The awards will be presented on Wednesday, Dec. 16, at 5
    p.m. at the Carnegie Institution Building at 1530 P Street, N.W.,Washington, D.C.
    Following each award the recipients will speak briefly about their work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest
    administers the Joe A. Callaway award, established by Callaway to recognize individuals in
    any area of endeavor who, with integrity and at some personal risk, take a public stance
    to advance truth and justice, and who challenged prevailing conditions in pursuit of the
    common good. Toward this end, Callaway endowed the Trust with a special fund for an annual
    award honoring citizens for their civic courage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest was
    created to extend the civic values of the late Shafeek Nader, community advocate and
    founder of the Northwestern Connecticut Community College. A tax-exempt organization, the
    Trust has the task of advancing the ability of citizens to participate and shape the
    quality of democracy in their community.</font></p>
