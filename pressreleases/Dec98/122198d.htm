        - December 21 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Citing an &quot;extraordinary level of forgiveness&quot; by the victims' 
families and firm Quaker opposition to the death penalty, the American Friends 
Service Committee (AFSC) has urged the Nebraska Board of Pardons to grant 
clemency to death-row inmate Randolph Reeves.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">AFSC joins a host of local and national religious and anti-death penalty 
organizations working to overturn Reeves's death sentence. Attention has been 
heightened since an execution date of January 14 was announced in November.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Reeves, a 42-year-old Native American (Omaha Tribe), was convicted of 
stabbing to death two women, Janet Mesner and Victoria Lamm, in a Quaker 
meetinghouse in 1980. Reeves is the adopted son of Don and Barbara Reeves of 
Central City, Nebraska. Don Reeves is a member of the AFSC Board of Directors.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During its November 11 meeting in Philadelphia, the AFSC Corporation, the 
organization's governing body, approved a measure requesting clemency for 
Reeves.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Although AFSC's opposition to the death penalty is based on Quaker 
values, we believe that this case merits particular attention because of the 
extraordinary level of forgiveness by the families of both victims. The mercy 
demonstrated by the Mesners and the Lamms is an inspiration and should force us 
all to recognize that execution by the state can never be an answer to the grief 
of murder victims' families and loved ones,&quot; said Kara Newell, executive 
director of AFSC.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We are also mindful of the pain this case has caused all families 
involved, including the Reeves, and reaffirm our support for Don and Barbara and 
their entire family during this most difficult time,&quot; Newell said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ken and Mildred Mesner, parents of murder victim Janet
Mesner, have publicly 
spoken out against the pending execution of Randy Reeves. They have provided 
testimony before the Nebraska Legislature's Judiciary Committee calling for a 
repeal of the state's death penalty laws. In addition, they have granted 
numerous interviews with print and broadcast media to call for clemency for 
their daughter's murderer.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;From the very beginning, we have felt that taking Randy's life for 
revenge is not an option. To take Randy's life will only cause more pain and 
suffering, and not bring Janet back,&quot; Ken Mesner said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The husband and daughter of Victoria Lamm, likewise, have taken a public 
stand in the effort to halt Reeves's execution. They had not commented on the 
death sentence against Reeves until recently but have begun granting media 
interviews, including an appearance on a December 10 television news broadcast 
in Lincoln. The Lamms traveled from their home in Oregon to meet with two 
members of the Board of Pardons on December 11 to ask that Reeves's sentence be 
commuted.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I think there has been enough killing in this particular case,&quot; 
said Gus Lamm, Victoria Lamm's husband. &quot;Evil is time-limited, but good 
lasts so much longer.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Victoria's daughter, Audrey Lamm, said: &quot;Losing another person doesn't 
bring her (Victoria) back, it doesn't do any honor to her memory.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The case deeply affected members of the small Quaker meeting in Central City, 
Nebraska, where the murders took place, as well as the meeting in Lincoln, 
Nebraska, and where both the Reeves and Mesner families are members. Quakers, 
who are known for pacifist beliefs and acknowledgment of the value of each 
individual, were forced to confront a violent act within their community. At a 
worship service the day following the murders, members of the Central City 
Meeting placed two flowers in the sanctuary - one for the victims and one for 
the accused. Several members there continue to work against the death penalty.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of activities aimed at bringing the case to the attention of state 
officials and the public include: daily vigils at the Capitol, a speaking tour 
around the state by a group comprised of families of murder victims, and a rally 
at the Capitol on Sunday, January 3.</font>

justice, peace and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the 
worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and 
injustice.</FONT></I> </P></td>
