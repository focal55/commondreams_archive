      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - December 22 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">More than 15,000 consumers have filed complaints saying that olestra, the 
indigestible fat substitute used in Wow snack chips and Fat Free Pringles, has 
caused problems ranging from gas to bloody stools to cramps so severe that they 
had to go to the emergency room. Today, the Center for Science in the Public 
Interest (CSPI), a nonprofit health group, provided the FDA adverse-reaction 
reports from 1,080 people ranging in age from 2 to 82. The new reports add to 
the 1,167 complaints previously submitted by CSPI and 13,317 reports submitted 
by Procter and Gamble, which markets olestra under the Olean brand name. 
According to CSPI, survey research shows that those reports represent only a 
small fraction of the people actually affected by olestra.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">More than 100 people in CSPI’s latest submission of adverse-reaction reports 
sought medical attention. Forty people went to the emergency room, where several 
were treated for dehydration. In some cases, doctors labeled olestra the cause 
of the symptoms.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Victims reported that olestra’s side effects caused them problems ranging 
from mild inconvenience to serious safety risks. Olestra made some people soil 
their clothing at work or school, ruin their vacations, miss work, leave young 
children unattended, and vomit while driving. Two flight attendants and a 
military pilot said olestra prevented them from flying.</font> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A 70-year-old Pennsylvania woman ate about an ounce of Lay’s Wow chips. Four 
hours later she experienced intense abdominal cramps that forced her into a 
fetal position for hours. She went to the emergency room and was prescribed 
drugs to relieve her cramps.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A 4-year-old New Hampshire boy ate a handful of chips and was awakened that 
night with severely painful stomach cramps.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A 52-year-old teacher in North Carolina who had eaten two ounces of Wow chips 
per day was at school where she experienced such severe cramps and diarrhea that 
she had to run from her classroom to get to the bathroom in 
time.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In a letter to FDA commissioner Jane Henney, Michael F. Jacobson, executive 
director of CSPI, urged the agency to ban olestra or, at the very least, to 
require a prominent warning label on the fronts of packages stating that olestra 
can cause severe diarrhea or cramps. He urged Henney to &quot;protect infants, 
children, adults, and seniors from the pain, embarrassment, and inconvenience 
that olestra is causing on a massive scale.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Jacobson also urged consumers, &quot;Don’t take a chance with your friends or 
loved ones’ stomachs by serving Fat Free Pringles or WOW chips at holiday 
parties. And if Santa leaves fake-fat chips in your stocking, give them 
back.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The FDA and Procter and Gamble have maintained that there is no proof that 
olestra caused the symptoms reported. But CSPI’s Jacobson retorted that clinical 
studies submitted to the FDA by Procter and Gamble proved that olestra can cause 
severe gastrointestinal symptoms.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Severe side effects might be acceptable from a cancer drug, but they 
are completely unacceptable from a food additive consumed by millions of people. 
Consumers shouldn’t have to play Russian roulette with their health when they 
eat a few potato chips,&quot; said Jacobson.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Leo Galland, an internal-medicine specialist in New York City who 
testified at an FDA advisory-committee meeting on olestra, said, &quot;Olestra 
has had its test market on the American public, and it clearly flunked the test. 
The FDA should ban olestra before it causes even more misery.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">CSPI received most of the adverse-reaction reports from its Internet web 
site, <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/olestraform">www.cspinet.org/olestraform</a>
. The rest came in on CSPI’s toll-free line, 
1-888-OLESTRA. Eighty percent of the people said they had eaten Frito-Lay’s WOW 
chips, the rest had eaten Procter and Gamble’s Fat Free Pringles.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While olestra’s adverse reactions have piled up, olestra proponents have 
pushed the FDA to downplay or remove the label notice that states &quot;Olestra 
may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile, CSPI has asked the Federal Trade Commission to require a health 
warning in ads for olestra-containing products. Earlier this year, the Council 
of Better Business Bureaus found that certain Olean ads were misleading because 
they implied that olestra is a natural substance and that it looks like an 
ordinary vegetable oil.</font></P>
