    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - December 15 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Fifty
    years after Alger Hiss was indicted in a controversial anti-communist case, leading
    scholars, historians and archivists joined the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/litigation.html">Public Citizen Litigation Group </a>today
    in calling for the release of secret documents pertaining to one of the most important
    political and legal events of the early Cold War era.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
    conviction of Hiss, accused of being a Soviet agent while serving in the State Department,
    convinced many Americans that the threat of Soviet subversion was real. Despite a number
    of books written about the Hiss case -- including books written by Hiss and his chief
    accuser, Whittaker Chambers -- questions about changed testimony, judicial improprieties
    and political interference with the legal process by then-U.S. Rep. Richard M. Nixon
    remain unanswered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Public Citizen filed<a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/hissbrf.htm"> legal documents</a> today --
    the 50th anniversary of Hiss&#146;s grand jury indictment -- with the U.S. District Court
    in the Southern District of New York in support of a petition asking for the release of
    the grand jury records relating to the indictment. Hiss was later convicted of two counts
    of perjury arising out of his denials under oath before the grand jury. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Fifty years of secrecy is long enough,&quot; said
    David Vladeck, director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group. &quot;It&#146;s time to
    lift the shroud of secrecy and let the American people judge for themselves whether
    justice was served by the indictment and conviction of Hiss.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Full disclosure of the grand jury transcripts is also
    favored by Hiss&#146;s son, Tony, and Chambers&#146;s friend and colleague, William F.
    Buckley Jr., founder of the National Review. Both Hiss and Buckley signed affidavits in
    support of the petition, filed jointly by the American Historical Association, American
    Society of Legal History, Organization of American Historians and Society of American
    Archivists. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I believe my father would have been honored to be
    associated with this petition,&quot; Tony Hiss wrote in his affidavit. &quot;As long as he
    lived, Alger Hiss was deeply interested in having these grand jury records unsealed.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Buckley, a prominent defender of Chambers, stated in his
    affidavit that &quot;disclosure of these grand jury materials would allow historians,
    journalists, and other interested persons to close the chapter on the Hiss-Chambers
    affair.&quot; Buckley also stated that &quot;based on my friendship with (Chambers), I can
    say with full assurance that he would not oppose full release of these grand jury
    materials.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By mid-1947 two government investigations into Soviet
    espionage within the government agencies were under way. The House Un-American Activities
    Committee, led by Rep. Karl Mundt and Nixon, carried on its own investigation on Congress&#146;s
    behalf, while the Justice Department impaneled a grand jury to investigate the allegations
    of espionage in the United States. Chambers first denied any knowledge of espionage but
    later changed his story and made detailed assertions that Hiss provided him with State
    Department documents to convey to Soviet agents. Hiss denied the allegations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chambers also produced for Nixon several rolls of 35mm film
    he had hidden in a hollowed-out pumpkin. Once developed, the film revealed copies of State
    Department documents, which later became known as the &quot;pumpkin papers.&quot; Nixon
    also appeared before the grand jury at his own request and testified about the film. Hiss&#146;s
    lawyers later alleged that Nixon&#146;s testimony may have been unduly influential. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The reasons for grand jury secrecy are virtually
    eliminated here with the discharge of the grand jury, the passage of fifty years and the
    deaths of all the major participants,&quot; Vladeck said at a press conference today at
    New York University&#146;s Law School. &quot;The release of these documents could provide
    vital new information on Hiss&#146;s guilt or innocence.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Public Citizen is a non-profit consumer advocacy
    organization with extensive experience in working to open government records and to
    preserve historically significant records. In April 1996, after more than 15 years of
    litigation, work by Public Citizen Litigation Group culminated in an agreement to release
    thousands of hours of White House audio tapes that revealed important new insights into
    the Nixon presidency.</font></p>
