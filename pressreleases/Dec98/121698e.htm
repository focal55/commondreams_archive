        - December 16 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International launched today urgent worldwide appeals to the US and 
UK governments reminding them that life, safety and security of civilians must 
be paramount in any action taken to resolve the new crisis over Iraq.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Imminent military attacks by US and UK forces could lead to 
indiscriminate or disproportionate killings of civilians. The experience of 
previous armed intervention in the Gulf has shown that, all too often, civilians 
become the acceptable casualties of war. All governments have an obligation to 
respect and protect civilian life&quot;, Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In November 1998, Amnesty International wrote to the US and UK governments 
urging that life, safety and security of civilians must be the paramount 
consideration in any action taken to resolve conflicts and to insure the 
protection of civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law. 
Amnesty International also wrote to the Iraqi government and urged that all 
necessary measures be taken to protect the civilian population in Iraq.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During the Gulf War in 1991 thousands of civilians in Iraq were killed in 
aerial bombardment of Baghdad and other cities by US and allied forces. In one 
such incident, more than 300 civilians were killed in the 'Amariya air raid 
shelter in Baghdad.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International's fear of imminent attacks comes in the light of the 
report by the head of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) to the UN Security 
Council on 15 December about Iraq's reported lack of full cooperation with UN 
weapons inspectors and the sudden evacuation from Iraq of UN staff, including UN 
humanitarian workers.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Last month, US and UK forces narrowly aborted a military attack against Iraq 
after it had announced on 14 November that it would resume full cooperation with 
UN weapons inspectors. However, both the US and UK governments have since 
repeatedly indicated that military action against Iraq will be taken 
immediately, without a UN Security Council resolution, should it fail to 
cooperate with UN weapons inspectors in the future. The threat of military 
attacks against Iraq came after its decision on 31 October to end all 
cooperation with UN weapons inspectors.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International's fears for the safety of the civilian population in 
Iraq have been heightened by reports which appeared in November in the US press. 
On 16 November 1998 the US newspaper, the Washington Post, reported that 
President Clinton had been warned by the Pentagon that the initial attack plan 
would result in by far the most deadly military undertaking of his presidency, 
possibly killing 10,000 Iraqis.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 17 November 1998, another US newspaper, the New York Times, 
wrote:&quot;Aides to Mr. Clinton said that in making his decision, he was 
troubled by Pentagon estimates that several thousand Iraqis, including 
civilians, would be killed in the air strikes, a death toll far greater than any 
other American military strike since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International has so far received no confirmation from US officials 
as to the accuracy of these newspaper reports. On 13 November the organization 
publicly expressed concern that civilians might be indiscriminately killed in 
the event of a military action against Iraq.</font> </P>
