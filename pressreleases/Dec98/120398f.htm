        - December 3 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
The question before the president and Congress is simple: As we cross the bridge 
into the 21st century, are we willing to leave seniors -- especially older women 
-- behind?</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Republican <A href="http://www.congress.org/">Congress</A> has already 
turned its back on the working poor by refusing to increase the minimum wage and 
pulled public assistance out from under the unemployed poor. Now conservatives 
in Congress are turning their attention not only to the elderly, but also to 
people with disabilities, widows and orphans.  And we have no reason to believe 
that <A href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/">Social Security</A> will survive a 
revamp by Livingston and Lott . . .unless our campaign to educate and mobilize 
the public is successful.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A chicken-little atmosphere has been created by the millions of Wall Street's 
dollars pushing for privatization of Social Security. (With the Social Security 
system taking in some $1.5 billion a day, the possible fees for managing even a 
fraction of that amount are quite an incentive.) But what we are facing is not a 
crisis; it's a scam. The threat our families face is not the imminent collapse 
in Social Security funding, but a possible shortfall after 2032.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Congress created the current Social Security Trust Fund (financed by the 
excess of current payroll taxes over current payments to beneficiaries and 
currently growing by more than $100 billion a year) to help the system meet the 
challenge of supporting baby boomers who will begin to retire in 2010. By 2032, 
when the Trust Funds may be drawn down to zero, the system will be purely 
pay-as-you-go – as it was from the 1940s through the 1960s.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">And those projections are based on a cautious economic forecast.  The Social 
Security Trustees project an annual increase in GDP, adjusted for inflation, of 
only 1.6% from 1997 to 2029.  Growth from 1960 to 1974 averaged 4.1%; from 1975 
to 1996, it averaged 2.7%.  Maintaining current levels of growth would sustain 
Social Security through the next century without any changes in the program.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> Women must be particularly wary of the remedies proposed to fix Social 
Security.  After a lifetime of work, women often find ourselves in dire economic 
straits during what was supposed to be our golden years. Women are a majority of 
all Social Security recipients, and roughly three out of four of the recipients 
over 85 are women.  Older women are twice as likely as men to live in poverty.  
And senior women are twice as likely to depend on Social Security as their sole 
support.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Privatizers want Generation X to join their attacks against Social Security, 
but young people should beware. Seniors aren't the only ones who benefit from 
Social Security.  Three million children and their sole caretaker parents depend 
on Social Security's death and disability benefits to survive.  Indeed, Social 
Security's safety net is wide; without it, vulnerable people of all ages will 
suffer.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Under the cover of a fantasy funding crisis and in the name of reducing 
government, conservatives want to revise or even eliminate Social Security in 
ways that will essentially eliminate the safety net.  We must use this 
opportunity to strengthen and make Social Security more equitable, especially 
for women.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">There are many important benefits under the current program that would not be 
available under privatization.  For instance, 63% of women on Social Security 
receive benefits based on their husband's earnings (wives or widows' benefits), 
while only 1.2% of men receive benefits based on their wife's earnings; 37% of 
these women had no earnings history and 26% had a higher benefit as a wife or 
widow than as an earner.  Under a private plan, the progressive aspects of 
Social Security that provide a buffer for the poor would be lost, i.e. Social 
Security replaces a higher proportion of low-wage workers' income when they 
retire.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, lifelong benefits are especially important to women, who after 
reaching 65 have a life expectancy of 19.2 years compared to 15.6 for men. What 
are older women supposed to do if they exhaust their assets before death? 
Adjustment for increases in cost of living under Social Security is also crucial 
to saving older women from poverty.  Without such protection even a modest 3% 
inflation rate cuts the purchasing power of a $100 benefit to $74 over 10 years 
and to $55 after 20 years.  Inflation adjusted private annuities are 
non-existent in this country, and lifetime annuities, if available, would be 
prohibitively expensive.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">As the economy fluctuates, so will the yields of privatized plans. Between 
1965 and 1978 the market lost 45% of its value. Seniors need a steady income 
they can count on, not the booms and falls of the market.The impact on women 
would be disastrous.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">While Social Security is an important program to seniors, the disabled and 
children who survive the death of a parent, there is a lot of room for 
improvement. Gender neutral language does not mean equality; women currently 
recieve an average of only $621 in monthly benefits, while men recieve $810.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We challenge Congress and the president to change the distribution of spousal 
and primary earner benefits to make them equitable so that homemakers are no 
longer penalized for choosing to work in the home instead of the paid workforce. 
We want the cap on social security taxes raised to remove the extra tax burden 
on secondary wage earners. And we want to establish earnings sharing that will 
allocate 50% of both spouses' combined earnings to each individual spouse, at 
long last allowing both spouses to have benefits in her or his own right. In 
other words, we want women's work – in and out of the home – to be counted and 
compensated.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If Social Security reform is not done compassionately and carefully, reports 
of grandmotherly women forced to eat cat food will be commonplace; the ranks of 
the elderly poor will swell; and this country will be guilty of abandoning our 
parents and grandparents.  We must not let that happen.  All of us must lobby 
Congress and the president to demand that we strengthen Social Security instead 
of dismantling it. We cannot afford to settle for anything less.</font> </P>
