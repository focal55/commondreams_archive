    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - December 11 - </font><p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Statement by Gloria Feldt, President <br>
    Planned Parenthood Federation of America </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Planned Parenthood is heartened by statistics
    released today by the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) showing that the U.S. abortion rate
    is at its lowest point in 20 years. The decline in abortions through the 1990s has been
    caused not just by demographic factors, but by a very significant decrease in unintended
    pregnancy across all age groups. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This did not happen by itself. The drop in unintended
    pregnancy, and in teen pregnancy especially, is the fruit of years of work by groups like
    Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood health centers across the country have worked
    tirelessly to educate Americans, especially young people, about the need to make
    responsible choices. We provide confidential family planning information and care for
    young people -- a safe place for teens to go when they need help with a sexual health
    issue and feel they can't talk to anyone else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our approach is working. Between 1988 and 1995, there was a
    twenty percent increase in the percentage of teens who use contraception at first
    intercourse. More than three-quarters of teens are now using contraception the first time
    they have sex. And during the same time period, the level of teen sexual activity also
    began to decline. Clearly, the abstinence and safer sex messages are not in conflict
    &#150; they combine into a message of responsible choices that is working for teens. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The prospect of providing abortions earlier in pregnancy
    due to increased availability of medical abortion is another piece of good news contained
    in the AGI study. Planned Parenthood centers participated in the large-scale trials of
    mifepristone, and we are now making methotrexate available to American women. The AGI data
    show that when mifepristone finally reaches the American market, it will be widely
    accepted by health providers. Our own experience shows that many women will choose it. We
    are making important progress in helping women who need abortions have them earlier. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Medical abortion, however, will not immediately answer the
    need for new abortion providers. The AGI study found that very few physicians have begun
    offering medical abortion unless they were already also providing surgical abortion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">AGI found a fourteen percent decrease in the number of
    abortion providers overall. This underlines the importance of Planned Parenthood centers
    and other abortion providers who stand firm in a commitment to serve the health of poor
    women and rural women who could not otherwise find a safe abortion. Planned Parenthood
    remains extremely concerned about the continued decline in access to abortion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">AGI for the first time also collected data on the number of
    intact dilation and extraction (D&amp;X) abortion procedures, as defined by the American
    College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). However, the collection of this data
    has little relevance for the debate over the attempt to ban so-called
    &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion. The bill that has been twice vetoed by President
    Clinton, like the 28 bills passed at the state level, contains language so broad and vague
    that it would outlaw not just D&amp;X, but most common abortion methods even early in a
    pregnancy. That is why, in recent weeks, federal courts in New Jersey, Arkansas, Kentucky
    and Florida have joined numerous other courts in declaring bans on so-called
    &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion to be unconstitutional. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The American people do not want any more divisive abortion
    battles. Most Americans want programs that help people get the information and services
    they need to make responsible choices, and want politicians to stop trying to intrude in
    those decisions. That is why Planned Parenthood is moving forward with our Responsible
    Choices Action Agenda, to increase support for family planning programs that prevent the
    need for abortion without undermining access to it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the progress shown in the AGI study, America's
    rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion are still far higher than those in many
    European nations. Planned Parenthood will redouble its efforts to make reducing unintended
    pregnancy a national priority. Helping Americans plan their families ensures that more
    children are born to parents ready to nurture and love them. The positive impact on
    children and families carries over into our society as a whole. If we can further reduce
    our nation's rate of unintended pregnancy, we will see significant progress on the many
    related social problems facing our nation. This latest report from AGI confirms that we
    are moving in the right direction.&quot;</font></p>
