        - December 8 -
Common Cause and Democracy 21 today strongly urged the Federal Election 
Commission (FEC) to uphold its staff's findings that the 1996 Clinton and Dole 
campaigns committed massive violations of the presidential election spending 
limits and should accordingly make major repayments of public funds.<BR><BR>In a 
joint letter delivered today to members of the FEC, Common Cause and Democracy 
21 urged the FEC not to abandon &quot;the Commission's own standard of law - the 
'electioneering message' standard - for determining when political party ads are 
subject to federal contribution and spending limits.&quot; <BR><BR>The FEC staff 
found that the 1996 party ads, run in coordination with the Clinton and Dole 
campaigns, contained &quot;electioneering messages&quot; and therefore should be 
treated as campaign ads covered by federal campaign finance laws.<BR><BR>The 
Common Cause-Democracy 21 letter comes on the heels of the December 3 meeting of 
the Commission to discuss its own staff's audits of the 1996 Clinton and Dole 
campaigns. The staff audit reports cited substantial evidence and found that 
both campaigns engaged in massive illegal schemes to violate the presidential 
campaign finance laws. According to the FEC staff audits, the Clinton campaign 
broke a $31-million spending limit by more than $46 million, and the Dole 
campaign spent more than $17 million outside the limits.<BR><BR>The Commission 
will take the issue up again at its meeting tomorrow, December 9.<BR><BR>In 
their letter, Common Cause President Ann McBride and Democracy 21 President Fred 
Wertheimer noted that, at the FEC's recent meeting, some Commissioners 
complained that the electioneering message standard &quot;is too vague and that 
it has never been formally promulgated through the rulemaking process so the 
'regulated community' could be on notice of its application.<BR><BR>&quot;The 
discussion by some Commissioners,&quot; the letter continued, &quot;made it seem 
as if they believe the 'electioneering message' standard had been plucked from 
an alien source and foisted it on the Commission for the purposes of these 
audits.&quot;<BR><BR>Common Cause and Democracy 21 pointed out that the 
Commission itself developed the &quot;electioneering message&quot; standard as 
far back as 1984 and has for over a decade repeatedly applied it to Matters 
Under Review, advisory opinions and court cases. In 1995, the letter continues, 
the Commission itself again set forth the &quot;electioneering message&quot; 
standard as the applicable standard for determining when ads are treated as 
campaign ads, and are covered by federal campaign finance laws. The Commission 
itself has continued to apply this standard, even as recently as just six months 
ago.<BR><BR>&quot;It would be wholly inappropriate, and arbitrary and 
capricious, for the Commission to now retroactively abandon the Commission's own 
standard after the fact, in order to avoid holding the Clinton and Dole 
campaigns accountable for massive violations of the law during the 1996 
presidential elections,&quot; according to the Common Cause-Democracy 21 
letter.<BR><BR>&quot;To reject the staff audit recommendations by now discarding 
the Commission's 'electioneering message' standard would be to subvert, in a 
completely arbitrary and post hoc manner, the statute you are sworn to uphold 
and enforce. <BR><BR>&quot;And it would mean, as a practical matter, that the 
Commission is construing the presidential spending limits out of existence, for 
the Commission would be approving a means of blatantly evading those limits that 
presidential candidates would surely follow in the future,&quot; according to 
the letter.<BR><BR>&quot;It is no doubt true that the presidential campaigns and 
their political parties would now welcome the Commission arbitrarily abandoning 
its own settled law in an effort to supply a post hoc rationalization of their 
reckless campaign spending that the Commission staff correctly found violated 
the law in a massive way,&quot; McBride and Wertheimer wrote.<BR><BR>&quot;To do 
so, however, would be wholly inappropriate and wrong and would foster continued 
lawlessness in future campaigns. <BR><BR>&quot;The Commission has an obligation 
to uphold the spirit and the meaning of the campaign finance laws, and to 
enforce the law in a manner that will ensure that those who violate it face real 
consequences, for absent such enforcement there will be no compliance, and thus 
no law.&quot; </font>
