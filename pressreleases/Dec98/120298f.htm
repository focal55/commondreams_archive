        - December 2 - </font><FONT face=Arial size="2">This is a statement of Jane Hull Harvey, assistant general 
secretary of the General Board of Church and Society The United Methodist
        Church: <BR><BR>In the United States, millions of aged and disabled persons, 
especially women, depend on the US Social Security system for the basic 
necessities of life. For many older women, in particular, the Social Security 
system is often the one program that stands between them and poverty. Today, the 
livelihood of millions of older women is being threatened by proposals to 
privatize the existing federal retirement program. The proposals would replace a 
portion or all of the Social Security program with a new system of personal 
retirement accounts that would undermine the financial security of older women. 
<BR><BR>Women over the age of 65 are already in poverty at twice the rate of men 
over 65. While the current system is not perfect, it recognizes the inequity 
that most women face since they are more likely to spend fewer years in the 
workforce and earn less than men when they do work. Women are also likely to 
live longer lives than men in the United States. Most of the privatization 
proposals now before the US Congress make no provisions for these differences 
between men and women and, we believe, would make the poverty problem worse. In 
fact, any system that relies even partially on privatizing the social security 
system with personal savings accounts would perpetuate these differences into 
retirement, leaving most women to bear an inequality of sacrifice for their 
entire lives. <BR><BR>The United Methodist Social Principles urges social 
policies and programs that would ensure the aging the respect and dignity that 
is their right as senior members of society; affirms the need to support those 
in distress; and calls for the equal treatment of men and women in every aspect 
of their common life. Nowhere in the social order in this country do these three 
issues converge so dramatically as in the current debate over the future of 
Social Security. <BR><BR>The General Board of Church and Society affirms that 
the current Social Security system has protections for women which are not 
present in the privatization plans — lifetime benefits, dependents’ benefits, 
progressive benefits formula and adjustments for inflation. The current 
protections will benefit women greatly into the next century and beyond. We need 
a retirement system that will improve the status of women, not privatization 
plans that would break a system that currently is not broken.</FONT>
