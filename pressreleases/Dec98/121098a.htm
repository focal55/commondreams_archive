    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">PARIS - December 10 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">As
    governments around the world today celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
    Declaration of Human Rights, Amnesty International called on leaders around the world to
    make all human rights a reality for all. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Far from
    celebrating the role of governments, the organization said it would be celebrating the
    work of human rights defenders around the world who continue to be persecuted for trying
    to bring about the better world promised by governments in 1948. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Today should be a day of shame for many
    governments,&quot; said Pierre Sané, Secretary General of Amnesty International. &quot;A
    sense of shame that 50 years on from the spirit of idealism and commitment to a better
    world which framed the adoption of the UDHR, poverty affects hundreds of millions while
    the torture, &quot;disappearances&quot;, unfair trials and unlawful killings
    continue.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;While many leaders will mark today's historic
    occasion by reiterating their commitment to protecting human rights, Amnesty International
    will hold up a mirror to highlight just how far reality is from the world envisaged in the
    UDHR.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Behind the rhetoric is the reality. Amnesty
    International's 1998 Annual Report documents the facts. At least 1.3 billion people live
    on less than $1 a day, 117 governments torture their citizens; at least 55 governments
    unlawfully kill their citizens; at least 87 governments jail prisoners of conscience; at
    least 31 governments make their citizens &quot;disappear&quot;; and at least 40
    governments execute their citizens.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mr Sané's comments were made during the first ever world
    summit of human rights defenders, organized to mark the anniversary and taking place in
    the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, the location of the UDHR's adoption by the United Nations
    in 1948. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More than 300 grass-roots activists from over 100 countries
    have gathered in Paris to highlight their struggle and call on governments to help human
    rights defenders under attack. They are joined by well-known defenders such as Nobel
    laureates Rigoberta Menchú and José Ramos Horta, His Holiness the Dalai Lama; Chinese
    dissident Wei Jingsheng; US civil rights campaigner Angela Davis; and Algerian Newspaper
    Editor Salima Ghazali. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Later today, in a live satellite link-up with New York
    where the UN General Assembly is also celebrating the anniversary, the President of the
    summit will deliver a &quot;Paris Declaration&quot; on human rights defenders, which will
    be followed by a response from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I think all those who contributed to the conception
    of the UDHR in 1948 would be horrified to listen to the personal testimonies from these
    brave individuals gathered here who have been persecuted by their governments merely for
    peacefully trying to defend the rights set out in that historic document,&quot; Mr Sané
    said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I hope that many of those government representatives
    in New York will be chastened by the voices of ordinary people around the world who have
    shown extraordinary courage by taking it upon themselves to defend the rights of
    others.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although Amnesty International's annual report presents a
    bleak look at the state of human rights 50 years on, Mr Sané said that in some areas
    there had been improvement, but in many others governments failed to implement the
    majority of standards they themselves had set up since the UDHR's adoption. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In particular he focussed on the issue of impunity with the
    recent arrest of General Pinochet and the adoption in Rome this year of the statute for a
    permanent international criminal court. Although flawed, it presents the best chance we
    have of giving teeth to the UDHR and ensuring that future perpetrators of crimes against
    humanity are discouraged from committing human rights violations or are brought to justice
    when they do, Mr Sané argued. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Setting up an international criminal court is one of
    the greatest steps forward in human rights protection taken by the international
    community,&quot; Mr Sané said. &quot;A fitting way to mark the UDHR's anniversary would
    be for all governments to immediately ratify the statute without conditions so that the
    court can begin to bring about an end to the impunity that has marked the last fifty
    years.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International also welcomed the reforms undertaken
    by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to integrate human rights concerns into all the key
    areas of the UN's work, and called on governments to fully support these moves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The UDHR has been called 'the world's best kept
    secret' and 'little more than a paper promise' Mr Sané said. For the last 37 years,
    Amnesty International, together with tens of thousands of human rights defenders and
    non-governmental organizations, has been working to share that secret.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;When governments adopted the UDHR they promised to
    disseminate it throughout society. Today, on the fiftieth anniversary, we promise to
    redouble our efforts to make sure that for the next 50 years, the UDHR is no longer a
    secret, and challenge governments to finally live up to the promise they made fifty years
    ago.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Today's commemoration in Paris will conclude with musicians
    from around the world playing the biggest human rights concert since the Human Rights Now
    Tour ten years ago. Radiohead, Alanis Morissette, Asian Dub Foundation, Peter Gabriel,
    Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour, Kassav', Axelle Red, Shania Twain, Orlando Poleo, Jimmy
    Page and Robert Plant will perform in front of a packed Bercy Stadium.</font></p>
