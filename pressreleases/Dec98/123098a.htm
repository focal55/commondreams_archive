      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - December 30 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The world added 2,100 megawatts of new wind energy generating capacity in 
1998, a new all-time record, and 35 percent more than was added in 1997, 
according to preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The new wind turbines added in 1998 have pushed overall wind generating 
capacity worldwide to 9,600 megawatts at the end of this year--double the 
capacity in place three years earlier. <A 
href="http://www.worldwatch.org/alerts/981229a.html">(See Graph 1.)</A> These 
wind turbines will generate roughly 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 
1999--enough for 3.5 million suburban homes. Wind power is now the world's 
fastest growing energy source.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Wind power has also become one of the most rapidly expanding industries, with 
sales of roughly $2 billion in 1998. The wind industry is creating thousands of 
jobs at a time when employment in manufacturing is falling in many nations.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The 1998 boom in wind energy was led by Germany, which added 800 megawatts, 
pushing its wind energy capacity to over 2,800 megawatts. Germany's wind 
industry, which is only seven years old, is already producing as much 
electricity as two of the country's largest coal-fired power plants. In the 
windy northern state of Schleswig Holstein, wind now provides 15 percent of the 
electricity.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Spain also emerged as a major player in the wind power industry in 1998. 
Spain added 395 megawatts of wind power, pushing the country's overall capacity 
up 86 percent to 850 megawatts. In the northern industrial state of Navarra, 
which has a particularly active wind energy industry, 23 percent of the state's 
electricity already comes from wind turbines, most of them manufactured in local 
assembly facilities that employ hundreds of workers in the area around Pamplona.</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Wind power installations also grew rapidly in the United States in 1998, with 
some 235 megawatts of new capacity added across ten different states. The surge 
in U.S. wind investment, the largest since 1986, was spurred by efforts to take 
advantage of a wind energy tax credit that is scheduled to expire in June 1999. 
The largest projects are a 107-megawatt wind farm in Minnesota, one of 42 
megawatts in Wyoming, and one of 25 megawatts in Oregon. Most of the rest of the 
new capacity came in several dozen small projects, ranging from Maine to New 
Mexico.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Denmark continued as a leader in the global wind power industry in 1998, 
adding 235 megawatts of capacity. Denmark's 1,350 megawatts of wind power now 
generate over 8 percent of the country's electricity. And Denmark's wind 
companies have become leading exporters, accounting for over half the new wind 
turbines installed worldwide in 1998. Danish companies have also formed 
successful joint venture manufacturing companies in nations such as India and 
Spain, leading to the rapid transfer of wind energy technology to these 
countries. Altogether, the Danish wind industry had gross sales of just under $1 
billion in 1998, which roughly equals the combined sales of the nation's natural 
gas and fishing industries.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The nations that could benefit most from further growth of the wind industry 
are in the developing world, where power demand is growing rapidly, and most 
countries lack adequate indigenous supplies of fossil fuels. India is the leader 
so far, with over 900 megawatts of wind power in place, but wind development has 
slowed there in the last two years, due to a suspension of the generous tax 
breaks that were enacted in the mid-1990s. Indian observers expect the new 
government to restore some of these incentives, which could boost wind 
development in 1999.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Unlike India, China has not yet established a solid legal basis for a 
sustained wind power industry, but several companies have installed small wind 
projects there in the last few years with the help of foreign aid. China has 
clear potential to become a wind superpower--with abundant wind resources in 
several regions, including a vast stretch of Inner Mongolia that could be the 
Saudi Arabia of wind power. China's wind potential is estimated to exceed its 
total current generating capacity.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The dramatic growth of wind power in the 1990s stems from the introduction of 
supportive government policies in countries such as Germany and Spain. The most 
important policies to date are laws that guarantee access to the grid for wind 
generators at a legally set price for the electricity they produce. These laws 
have established a stable market for the new industry, and have overcome the 
resistance of coal- and nuclear-dependent utility companies to the new 
competition.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Some 80 percent of the global wind power market is now centered in just four 
countries--which reflects the failure of most other nations to adopt supportive 
renewable energy policies. Future market growth will depend in large measure on 
whether additional countries make way for renewable energy sources as they 
reform their electricity industries.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Advancing technology is also likely to spur wind energy development in the 
next few years. Modern wind turbines are high-tech devices with aerodynamic 
blade designs, made of lightweight composite materials, and electronic drives 
and controls. Larger turbines, more efficient manufacturing, and careful siting 
of wind machines have brought wind power costs down precipitously-from $2,600 
per kilowatt in 1981 to $800 in 1998. Wind power has already reached economic 
parity with coal-based electricity. And as the technology continues to improve, 
further cost declines are projected, which could make wind power the most 
economical new source of electricity in many countries in the next decade.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Overall, wind power is a far larger potential energy source than most people 
realize. In the United States, the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and 
Texas have sufficient wind capacity to provide electricity for the entire 
nation. A study by Danish researchers in 1998 laid out a scenario for providing 
10 percent of the world's electricity from wind within the next 2 decades. In 
the longer run, wind power could easily exceed hydropower--which now supplies 23 
percent of the world's electricity--as an energy source.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Accelerated growth of the wind industry is likely in 1999, with at least 
2,500 megawatts of capacity likely to be installed according to Worldwatch 
Institute estimates. Spain and the United States should have particularly good 
years, probably exceeding 500 megawatts of new turbines each. Other countries 
where market growth is likely include Canada, Italy, Japan, Norway, and the 
United Kingdom. Among developing countries, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, 
Egypt, and Morocco are some of the nations that appear poised to develop 
sizeable wind industries in the coming years.</font></P>
