        - December 23 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The Wye Memorandum signed two months ago today on 23 October 1998 was founded 
on the sacrifice of human rights in the name of &quot;security&quot;. Far from 
protecting human rights, its implementation even encouraged human rights 
violations, Amnesty International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, it is time to recognize that durable peace can only be built on 
human rights safeguards,&quot; the organization added. &quot;No matter how many 
agreements are signed, peace cannot be founded on injustice&quot;.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Wye Memorandum not only failed to consider human rights concerns as a 
fundamental part of the agreement; the implementation of its clauses over the 
past two months has even encouraged the Israeli and Palestinian governments to 
violate human rights.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;In the run up to the Israeli elections, recently voted by the Knesset, 
there is a risk that human rights may again be sidelined,&quot; Amnesty 
International said. The organization is calling on parties involved in the peace 
process for a new commitment to human rights and for the release of all 
political detainees held without a fair trial.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the name of &quot;security&quot; Israel has effectively
legalized torture, 
held people under administrative detention and allowed the security forces to 
carry out extra-judicial and other unlawful killings with impunity.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">To implement the Wye Memorandum Israel has released 250 prisoners. Among 
them, however, 150 were convicted criminals and only 100 political prisoners, 
many of whom were approaching the end of their prison terms.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Five Palestinians have been shot dead and more than 250 injured by Israeli 
forces during demonstrations over the past two weeks for the release of 
prisoners or against the bombing of Iraq. The demonstrations have involved 
stone-throwing, but the lives of Israeli security forces have not, apparently, 
been in danger.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Amnesty International is renewing its call on Israel to release those held 
under administrative detention without fair trial and to ensure that the use of 
firearms by its security forces conforms with international standards.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">To comply with the security provisions of the Wye Memorandum the Palestinian 
Authority has increased the numbers of suspected supporters of Islamist groups 
held without charge or trial.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">After suicide bombs wounded Israeli civilians during the week after
Wye, 
around 200 suspected supporters of Hamas and Islamic Jihad were arrested. With 
the apparent encouragement of the USA and Israel they were detained, sometimes 
for weeks, without access to their families or lawyers. None of them was charged 
or tried. Court judgments providing for the release of detainees are totally 
ignored by the police.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A Muslim religious leader, Shaykh Hamed Bitawi, arrested in Nablus by 
Palestinian police the day after the Wye Memorandum for publicly criticizing the 
agreement, was held for nearly two months before being released on Saturday. He 
said that he had not been charged or even questioned during his detention.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Before the negotiations in Wye opened two months ago, 
Amnesty International had urged Israel and the Palestinian Authority to include 
&quot;explicit and detailed provisions to ensure respect for human rights, 
especially the right to physical integrity, the right to security of the person 
and the right to receive a fair trial&quot;.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">By contrast, while emphasizing repeatedly the need for action on 
&quot;security&quot;, the Wye Memorandum contained only a vague reference to the 
need to respect human rights. The Memorandum required the Palestinian Police to 
&quot;implement this Memorandum with due regard to internationally accepted 
norms of human rights and the rule of law.&quot; In stark contrast, the 
agreement was silent about the need for Israel to respect human rights.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The United States has been intimately involved in facilitating negotiations 
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The Wye Memorandum gives the 
United States a major role in facilitating &quot;security cooperation&quot; 
through its involvement in a &quot;Tripartite Committee&quot; and other 
mechanisms.</font> </P>
