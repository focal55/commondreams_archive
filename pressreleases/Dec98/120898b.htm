      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">PORTLAND,
        OR - December 8 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Communities across the United States are providing some 'light at the end of the 
tunnel' for the increasing number of uninsured who are facing problems accessing 
health care. More and 
more frequently, the uninsured are working families who are just like their 
neighbors, except that they are cut off from the American healthcare 
system.</font>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    With over 43 
million uninsured people in this country, according to recent Census Bureau 
data, the work of community health groups offers valuable lessons about 
innovative ways to narrow widening gaps in accessing health and medical 
services. (Another 31 million people are classified as &quot;underinsured&quot; 
and face many of the same problems.)</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    The Access 
Project has organized a Northwest Regional Meeting, December 11th at the 
Sheraton Airport Hotel in Portland, because of the work being done in the 
Northwest by community-based organizations, local initiatives and health-access 
advocates to respond to the needs of those &quot;left out&quot; of the health 
care picture. Community representatives from Oregon, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, 
Nevada, Utah and Washington are scheduled to attend this all-day forum, where 
they can share ideas and information about the work they are doing.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    According to 
Ellen Pinney, Executive Director of the Oregon Health Action Campaign (OHAC), 
community organizations have been the backbone for advocacy and delivery of 
safety-net care for a long time. &quot;We need to learn from each other 
constantly. The Access Project meeting is a tremendous forum for the seven 
states in this area to learn about some of the best programs and organizing 
efforts that are collaborating in the region to move national health reform 
forward,&quot; says Pinney.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    Catherine M. 
Dunham, the National Program Director for The Access Project, says: &quot;A 
significant part of our mandate is to find and map innovation at the local 
level, where we believe healthcare reform is already occurring. We are finding 
in these regional meetings that important answers to the healthcare access 
problem are 'home grown'.&quot;</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    Last year, 
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a national healthcare philanthropy, 
recognized the value of connecting these local health access initiatives to one 
another and funded The Access Project at the Heller Graduate School at Brandeis 
University. The broad mission of The Access Project is to improve the health of 
our nation by working with local communities to develop and sustain efforts to 
promote universal healthcare access for people who are without health 
insurance.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    Dunham says, 
that through this grassroots approach, communities are raising public awareness 
about the consequences of lack of health coverage for everyone. 
&quot;Ultimately, the goal is to connect communities that are working 
independently on this issue and to build broader support and momentum among 
policymakers to expand access to health care and coverage for people without 
insurance.&quot;</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    Bill Crimm, a 
health advocate for Utah Issues, a statewide organization active in health and 
poverty issues in Salt Lake City, states: &quot;The importance of this meeting 
in Portland is in jump-starting the stalled work of expanding coverage to the 
large and growing number of uninsured.&quot;</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    Carmen Bauer, 
the Executive Director of Centro LatinoAmericano, a member of Latino Medical 
Access Coalition (LMAC) in Portland, says her organization is dedicated to 
community prevention programs through education, case management and outreach. 
&quot;While we have services in the primary care area for the population that we 
serve, health access and affordability are still major barriers, even for people 
who are on the Oregon Health Plan,&quot; adds Bauer, who is presenting on 
&quot;Outreach to Vulnerable and Ethnic Populations&quot; at the 
meeting.</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    Steven 
Schroeder, M.D., President of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, says 
healthcare access expansion for under-served communities is a major priority for 
the Foundation. &quot;The Access Project is key to the Foundation's work in 
identifying new ways to improve access; help community leaders and organizations 
understand their local environment; and educate the broad, national policymaking 
community about access-to-care solutions.&quot;</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial" size="2">    The Portland 
meeting concludes this year's series of regional meetings sponsored by The 
Access Project. Previous meetings took place in Waltham, Massachusetts, El Paso, 
Texas, and Memphis, Tennessee.</font></P>
