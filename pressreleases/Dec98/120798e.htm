National Women's Law Center
Warns Individual Account Proposals Threaten Social Security Protections for

        - December 7 -
On the eve of the White House Conference on Social Security, National Women's Law
        Center Co-President Nancy Duff Campbell warned that proposals to replace
        Social 
Security in whole or part with individual accounts threaten essential protections 
for women and their families.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Campbell, an expert on Social Security who 
co-authored a study of earnings sharing in Social Security a decade ago, said 
that it was unfortunate that the debate over Social Security reform seems to be 
focused on moving to a system of individual accounts, which pose inherent risks
        for women.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Women still earn less than men and are more likely to take 
timeout of the workforce to care for children and other family members,&quot;
said Campbell.  &quot;Social Security provides benefits to low-wage workers that 
are a higher percentage of their lifetime earnings, and guarantees benefits to 
spouses, divorced spouses, and surviving spouses.  It is hard to see how a system 
of individual accounts would provide these important protections for women.&quot;Campbell also
        noted that women, who are more likely than men to live past 85, 
would be especially hard pressed to obtain through individual accounts the
lifetime protection that Social Security provides.</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;With
        Social Security, 
women don't have to worry that they will outlive their savings, or lose ground to 
inflation.  Private annuities are costly; few are indexed for inflation; and most 
private annuities base monthly payments on gender, so that women have less to 
live on for the same investment.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Also, Campbell emphasized, &quot;Social 
Security is more than a retirement program.  Nearly 4 million children receive
        Social Security survivors or disability benefits -- and 98 percent of
        the parents 
who receive benefits for caring for them are women. The savings in individual 
accounts will not protect families that must cope with a wage earner's disability 
or early death.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Campbell praised the White House for providing an 
opportunity for representatives of many different communities to discuss Social
Security issues with policymakers in the Administration and White House.  She 
said she hopes the conference will shift the public debate toward the real 
issues: how to strengthen Social Security by reforms that ensure adequate 
benefits for future generations and improve the economic security of women and 
their families.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">------   The National Women's Law Center is a non-profit 
organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect women's
        legal rights.  The Center focuses on major policy areas of importance to
        women and 
their families, including economic security, employment, education, and health, 
with special attention given to the concerns of low-income women.</font></p>
