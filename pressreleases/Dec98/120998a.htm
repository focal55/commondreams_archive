        YORK - December 8 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The North Carolina Environmental Defense Fund
        (NCEDF) today joined former NC 
Congressman Tim Valentine and a group of citizen and environmental activists to 
launch a powerful new web site as part of a campaign to clean up hog factories 
in North Carolina. The new web site, <A href="http://www.hogwatch.org" 
target=NEW>www.hogwatch.org</A>, will contain free, readily accessible facts and 
figures on the serious environmental and public health impacts of factory hog 
farming, along with detailed information on each of the state's more than 2,500 
factory hog farms. This solution-oriented clearinghouse is also designed to 
provide real opportunities for citizens to influence important policy and 
regulatory decisions. Environmental and community groups are hopeful of major 
reforms in the 1999 NC General Assembly legislative session.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The name of the web site conveys what environmental groups, community 
groups, and individual citizens are going to be doing – hogwatching -- until 
North Carolina solves the problems associated with factory hog farms,&quot; said 
Jane Preyer, director of NCEDF. &quot;This is a new tool in a broad-based 
campaign to resolve North Carolina's hog problems once and for all.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;North Carolinians have a right to know what's going on in their own 
backyards. The site describes the hog problem in graphic detail,&quot; said Dan 
Whittle, an NCEDF attorney. &quot;We are putting the facts on-line and providing 
new ways for the public to make their voices heard by the Governor and 
legislators.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The passage of the moratorium extension is positive, and provides much 
needed momentum for putting solutions in place. But there is still much to be 
done. If North Carolina fails to act, we will be back to ground zero when the 
moratorium runs out on September 1, 1999,&quot; said former Congressman 
Valentine, who's been a leader in calling for tougher controls on factory hog 
farm pollution.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Special features on the web site include:</font> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Interactive high-tech maps that will show exactly how many hog factories are 
in each county, how many hogs they raise, and how much waste those hogs produce. 
Click on a county and you can see instantly where the hogs are and which 
companies own them. The maps also show the close proximity of factory farms to 
rivers, streams, and other waterways.</font> 
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Informative fact sheets on major issues associated with hog factories such 
as environmental impacts, summaries of important research and scientific data, a 
comparison of municipal waste and hog waste treatment, a virtual tour of a hog 
factory, status of government regulation of hog factories, and proposed 
solutions to clean up hog factories.</font> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Personal testimonials from citizens who live next door to hog factories, 
describing their experiences.</font> 
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">A &quot;poop counter&quot; that shows the tremendous volume of hog waste 
being disposed of in North Carolina during every second of every day: Each hog 
generates over 10 pounds per day of hog waste, or 1.9 tons per year.</font> 
<P>
<UL type=CIRCLE>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Together, the 10 million hogs in NC create 52,000 tons of waste per day, or 
19 million tons per year. That's more waste in one year from hogs than the human 
population of Charlotte produces in 58 years.</font> 
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Total nitrogen pouring into North Carolina from hog factories is over 
640,000 pounds per day. Hog factories emit more nitrogen pollution into the air 
in coastal NC than all NC municipal and industrial sources combined.</font> </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<LI><font size="2" face="Arial">Updates on pending legislation and rulemaking and an action tool enabling 
citizens to immediately send free email to key decision makers in North 
Carolina.</font> </LI></UL>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Hogwatch web site will serve as a place where the facts speak for 
themselves and myths and public relations rhetoric no longer rule,&quot; said 
Whittle. “Most importantly, this web site offers up real and lasting solutions.”</font> 

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Environmental Defense Fund, a leading national, NY-based nonprofit 
organization, represents 300,000 members. EDF links science, economics, and law 
to create innovative, equitable and economically viable solutions to today's 
environmental problems.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Other groups joining NCEDF's launch of the website included Alliance for a 
Responsible Swine Industry, Bertie Citizens Action Coalition, Blue Ridge 
Environmental Defense League, Concerned Citizens of Tillery, Neuse River 
Foundation, North Carolina Coastal Federation, Pamlico-Tar River Foundation, 
Sierra Club/NC chapter, and Southern Environmental Law Center.</font>
