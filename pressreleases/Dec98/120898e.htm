      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">PARIS
        - December 8 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">In one of the most significant public commemorations of this Thursday's 50th 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Amnesty 
International today presented over 10 million individual pledges of support for 
the UDHR to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The pledges, gathered in 125 countries during a year long campaign by the 
worldwide human rights organization, were handed over in the Palais de Chaillot 
in Paris - the site of the adoption by the UN of the UDHR in 1948. Also today, 
in a globally coordinated event, Amnesty International representatives are 
handing over pledges to UN officials in over 20 countries.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;These pledges, signed by so many people from all walks of life in so 
many countries not only show powerful global support for the UDHR, but a demand 
to governments that they live up to the promise they made when adopting it 
&quot; a world without cruelty and injustice,&quot; said Pierre Sané, Secretary 
General of Amnesty International.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The fact that people from 125 countries have signed the pledge shows 
irrefutably that wherever the country, whatever the creed, the strong desire for 
human dignity will continue to beat in people's hearts.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Nobel Laureate and leader of the Burmese opposition Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was 
the first person to sign the pledge, which reads: &quot;I will do everything in 
my power to ensure that the rights contained in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights become a reality around the world.&quot; She was followed by UN 
High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since then they have been joined by politicians including Yasser Arafat, Tony 
Blair, Rafael Caldera, Jacques Chirac, Kim Dae-jung, Vaclav Havel, Yoweri
Museveni, Ezer Weizmann, and Lech Walesa; human rights defenders including the 
Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo; religious leaders including His Holiness the Dalai 
Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu; entertainers including U2, Mick Jagger, 
Courtney Love, Harrison Ford and Julia Roberts; and sports people such as 
Mohammed Ali, Brian Lara and the national football teams of South Africa, France 
and Holland.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Alongside the well-known names, millions of ordinary people, teachers, 
schoolchildren, trades unionists, churchgoers, police and army officers, have 
signed up to the pledge either in one of the 50,000 books distributed worldwide 
by Amnesty International or electronically through several specially created 
web-sites.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Body Shop joined forces with Amnesty International in the campaign with 
their Make Your Mark initiative, launched in Atlanta by His Holiness the Dalai 
Lama. Customers of Body Shop stores in 34 countries contributed three million 
thumbprints to the campaign pledge. These thumbprints were turned into portraits 
of human rights defenders and are part of the 10 million pledges collected in 
all.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The UDHR has been called 'the world's best kept secret',&quot; Mr Sané 
said. &quot;When governments adopted it in 1948, they promised to disseminate it 
throughout their countries in schools, colleges, government offices, local 
councils and workplaces.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yet 50 years on, how many people around the world have actually seen a 
copy? Amnesty International, together with thousands of other organizations, has 
been spending the past year in a massive global publicity campaign to do the job 
that governments have been failing to do.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The aim of the campaign was not only to acknowledge the importance of human 
rights, but also to inform and educate the global community at a grass-roots 
level about what their rights are. According to Mr Sané, it has reached people 
from all sectors of society in cities, towns, villages and remote rural 
communities in 120 countries.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The campaign has focused on the protection of human rights defenders at risk 
or imprisoned -- &quot;28 ordinary individuals who have taken the extraordinary 
step of dedicating their lives to defending the rights of others&quot;. In the 
course of its duration, two of them -- Dr Beko Ransome-Kutifrom Nigeria and 
Akhtam Nu'aysa from Syria -- have been released, and tens of thousands of 
letters, faxes and e-mails sent to government leaders, local officials and 
prison governors demanding an end to persecution, harassment and ill-treatment 
of the defenders.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Human rights are an issue for everyone, everywhere. Until the rights of 
all the world's citizens -- rich or poor, from whatever ethnic or religious 
background, political belief or gender -- are respected and upheld, all of us 
have a role to play in campaigning to protect human rights,&quot; Mr Sané added.</font>
