    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 15 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
    Feminist Majority joins with our sister organizations - and indeed the majority of women
    in this nation - in a united call to action to help stop this impeachment spectacle that
    has overtaken our political system. We stand today in disbelief that Congress is about to
    impeach a president who has the support of two-thirds of the American people - support
    which was voiced loud and clear on Election Day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you believe that the impeachment process must stop -
    call your member of Congress and your Senators at 202-225-3121. And call Speaker-elect Bob
    Livingston to urge him to allow a vote on censure. The Feminist Majority will join other
    women's groups, civil rights groups, and labor organizations in a vigil outside of the
    House of Representatives on Thursday from 10am to 2pm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Women leaders felt so strongly that this mockery of justice
    must come to an end that on September 24 - before the elections - we issued the first
    public call to action to stop the impeachment process. Now, we come together again in an
    effort to end this partisan travesty before it is too late. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We should not be lulled into complacency by the assumption
    that the U.S. Senate ultimately will be able to put a stop to this madness. A Senate trial
    will paralyze this nation. It would irreparably weaken the position of the office of the
    president and the global standing of the United States. It would bring to a standstill our
    chances of passing the Violence Against Women Act II and the Fair Pay Act, strengthening
    Social Security for women, and raising the minimum wage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Assume the worst - are these offenses crimes against the
    state - can we equate this misconduct - especially abhorrent to feminist leaders - with
    treason and bribery and abuse of presidential power? Of course not. We must keep some
    sense of proportionality. Precisely because of the sexual backdrop of this misconduct some
    of us felt compelled and duty-bound to speak out and to act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Women have an unique role to play in the process. We have
    disproportionately supported the President because of his record on the issues. We deplore
    his misconduct, but we also understand the hypocrisy of his opponents. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The self-righteous right wing opponents of sexual
    harassment law in their self-appointed role as sex police are distorting the concept of
    sexual harassment into a tool of selective prosecution. How ironic it is that the chair of
    the House Judiciary Committee who himself lived a double life will be the prosecutor in a
    Senate trial. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The irony continues. Elections in which the majority of
    women voted for the President and his policies are about to be declared null and void by a
    Congress which is comprised of only 12% women. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the beginning, there has been a gender gap in the
    public opinion polls in President Clinton's approval rating, with women supporting
    President Clinton most strongly. Throughout this scandal, women have maintained their
    strong support for the President. Today, President Clinton's approval rating is so high
    because the gender gap is closing with men moving in the direction that women initially
    staked out. In the November elections, exit polls revealed overwhelming opposition to
    impeachment. And social security and education mattered far more to voters than the
    Clinton/Lewinsky scandal. Yet Congress is on the brink of taking irrevocable actions which
    fly in the face of public opinion -- and of women's opinion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The President has sustained support from among women not
    only because of his record on issues that matter to women but also because of the record
    of his political opponents. Moreover, some of those who attack the President for immoral
    sexual behavior could not themselves stand the same public scrutiny. The public, and women
    most of all understand, this hypocrisy. </font></p>
