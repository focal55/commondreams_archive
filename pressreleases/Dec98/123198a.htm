        - December 31 - </font>Citing the results of a recent survey on parents, children and guns, Sarah 
Brady today offered a New Year's Resolution for gun-owning parents: If you 
own a gun, unload it and lock it up. Last month, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence released a nationwide poll conducted by Peter D.
        Hart 
Research Associates that showed that more than two in five of all American 
households with children have guns, and of those, about one in four keep 
those guns loaded and/or unlocked. Sarah Brady is the chair of Handgun 
Control Inc. and its educational affiliate, the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In the survey of 806 parents, conducted from October 31 to
November 4, 
1998, 43 percent of households with children have guns, and 23 percent of 
gun households keep a gun loaded. Twenty-eight (28) percent keep a gun 
hidden and unlocked.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Too many children in America,&quot; Sarah Brady said, &quot;have access 
to a loaded firearm in the home. And for too many households, it's a tragedy just waiting to happen. Nearly two thousand children and
teen-agers die from unintentional shootings and suicides each year and 
many more suffer non-fatal injuries. But it's not just families that are at 
risk when a gun is improperly stored, it's the entire community. Too many 
children are getting guns from private homes and carrying guns to school 
and, too often, with tragic results. No one wants to see another Jonesboro 
in 1999.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It's not that our children are necessarily bad. Children are 
<BR>naturally curious and many are attracted to guns. Don't let it be a fatal attraction. If you have a gun in the home, make sure that the
gun 
is unloaded and locked up. And store the ammunition separately in a locked 
container. It's just common sense.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;And,&quot; Sarah Brady emphasized, &quot;proper gun storage is not just
common sense. In many states, it's the law.&quot; Sixteen states now have laws Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws that hold gun owners
criminally 
responsible if they leave a firearm where a child can gain access to it and 
the child uses the gun to injure themselves or others.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sarah Brady also urged non-gun owning parents to consider asking
friends 
and neighbors whether there is a loaded, unlocked gun in the home when their 
children visit. Brady noted that the CPHV/Peter Hart poll found that only 30 
percent of parents have ever asked the question. &quot;I've met far too many 
grieving parents who wish they had asked. If your child is going next door 
to play or to stay overnight, you have a right to know whether there is an 
improperly stored gun in the home. Too many children are unintentionally 
shot by their friends. All too frequently, a child will take the ammunition magazine out of Dad's pistol and, believing it to be
empty, 
aim the gun at a friend and pull the trigger, not knowing that there can 
still be a bullet left in the chamber.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;If you're a parent, make gun safety a New Year's Resolution. It
could be the most important resolution you've ever made.&quot;</font> 
<P align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">------ </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, chaired by Sarah Brady,
was 
founded in 1983 to reduce gun violence through education, legal advocacy, 
research, and outreach to the entertainment community. Based in Washington, 
D.C., CPHV's national initiatives include prevention programs for parents 
and youth on the risks associated with guns, legal representation for gun 
violence victims, work with the entertainment community to encourage 
deglamorization of guns in the media, and research of the risks associated 
with guns and the efficacy of gun control laws. More information about CPHV 
and its affiliated organization, Handgun Control Inc., can be found on the website at <A href="http://www.cphv.org.">www.cphv.org.</A>
