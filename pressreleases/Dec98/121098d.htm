    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 10 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Americans
    United for Separation of Church and State announced today that it has asked the Internal
    Revenue Service to investigate eight churches around the country for intervening in
    partisan politics by distributing Christian Coalition voter guides two days before last
    month's election. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the formal complaints filed
    with the IRS today, Americans United noted that federal tax law does not allow non-profit
    organizations, including churches, to distribute partisan campaign material. The IRS Code
    forbids churches and other non-profit groups to &quot;participate in, or intervene in
    (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf
    of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Individual complaints document instances of voter guide
    distribution in conjunction with a Republican candidate speaking from the pulpit, a
    Republican party official distributing Coalition voter guides in a church and church
    ushers distributing guides to churchgoers. (See attached sheet for more details.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;These houses of worship are breaking federal tax law
    and penalties must be imposed,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United
    executive director. &quot;Partisan politics is not the business of America's
    churches.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The eight churches reported today are: Bayside Christian
    Fellowship, Green Bay, Wisc.; Calvary Chapel, Santa Ana, Calif.; Crossroads Cathedral,
    Oklahoma City; First Assembly of God, Worcester, Mass.; Lighthouse Baptist Church, St.
    Maries, Idaho; MetroChurch, Edmond Okla.; Sonrise Church, Hillsboro, Oregon and Wheaton
    Evangelical Free Church, Wheaton, Ill. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lynn noted that the Christian Coalition has repeatedly
    demonstrated its partisanship. Last September, the group sent out a nationwide
    fund-raising letter seeking money to pay for its guides. The letter stated that
    distribution of the guides would help prevent the &quot;nightmare&quot; of Dick Gephardt,
    Barney Frank, Ted Kennedy and other Democrats regaining control of Congress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Coalition is brazenly crowing about how it plans
    to use its guides to defeat Democrats,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;This fundraising letter is
    the smoking gun linking the guides to an orchestrated, illegal, pro-Republican campaign
    effort.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">TV preacher Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian
    Coalition and chairman of its board of directors, has indicated that his goal is control
    of the Republican Party and eventually both chambers of Congress and the White House. To
    meet this goal, Robertson has announced plans to draft 100,000 churches into the group's
    political activities. At a closed-door speech in Atlanta in September of 1997, Robertson
    said the Coalition should emulate Tammany Hall, one of the most notorious political
    machines in American history. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lynn noted that the IRS takes the issue of church
    politicking seriously. In 1995 the federal tax agency pulled the tax-exempt status of the
    Church at Pierce Creek, a Vestal, N.Y., congregation that in October of 1992 ran full-page
    ads in two newspapers asserting that voting for Bill Clinton was a sin. The church was
    reported to the IRS by Americans United. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last September, Americans United launched an aggressive
    clergy education campaign, including distribution of 80,000 memos, warning that past
    Christian Coalition voter guides had all the earmarks of partisan activity, including
    selective inclusion of issues and unjustified summaries of candidate positions. In
    addition, the guides were released days before the election to give candidates who
    believed they had been unfairly portrayed little time to respond. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Eight Churches Reported By Americans United To The
    Internal Revenue Service For Partisan Politicking</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On Nov. 10, Americans United reported eight churches to the
    Internal Revenue Service for distributing Christian Coalition voter guides. They are: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Bayside Christian Fellowship, Green Bay, Wisc.: Church
    officials allowed Republican congressional candidate Mark Green to speak from the pulpit
    Nov. 1 and offered prayers on his behalf. Christian Coalition voter guides, distributed in
    the church foyer, said Green's Democratic opponent Jay Johnson supported &quot;abortion on
    demand&quot; and &quot;special rights for homosexuals.&quot; (This congregation is home to
    controversial anti-gay professional football player Reggie White.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> MetroChurch, Edmond, Okla.: Ushers inside the church
    sanctuary distributed copies of Coalition voter guides. (This church has a history of
    partisan political activity. In April of 1997 the pastor endorsed two candidates for city
    council in the church bulletin and before the elections in 1996 officials with the local
    Republican Party distributed Coalition voter guides in church.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Crossroads Cathedral, Oklahoma City, Okla.: Coalition
    guides were stacked on a table near the church's south entrance. Democratic congressional
    candidate Paul Barby says he was unfairly portrayed in the guides. He answered a
    96-question form from the Christian Coalition, but Coalition leaders selected only four
    responses and manipulated them to make Barby look opposed to religious freedom, a balanced
    budget and term limits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Lighthouse Baptist Church, St. Maries, Idaho: John
    Farris, the head of the Republican Party in Benewah County, distributed Christian
    Coalition voter guides in this church. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> First Assembly of God, Worcester, Mass.: Coalition
    guides were stacked on a counter in the church foyer. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Calvary Chapel, Santa Ana, Calif.: Stacks of guides were
    left on tables around the church sanctuary. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Wheaton Evangelical Free Church, Wheaton, Ill.:
    Coalition guides were displayed prominently on a table in the church foyer next to the
    service's program. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Sonrise Church, Hillsboro, Oregon: During services, a
    church elder advised congregants to pick up Christian Coalition voter guides, which were
    stacked in an adjoining wing. </font></p>
