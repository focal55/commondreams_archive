        FRANCISCO - December 1 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">
The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California will honor 
Representative Ronald V. Dellums and other civil liberties champions at its 
annual Bill of Rights Day Celebration on Sunday, December 6, at the Sheraton 
Palace Hotel in San Francisco at 3 PM.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award, which honors champions in the fight 
for constitutional rights, will be presented to Representative Ronald V. Dellums. In 1998, Congressman Dellums retired from a remarkable career spanning 
three decades representing California's Eighth Congressional District (Oakland 
and Berkeley) in the House of Representatives.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Nationally renowned for his courageous advocacy for the rights of the 
poor and disenfranchised, we in Northern California are proud to claim this 
outstanding legislator as our own,&quot; said Dick Grosboll, Board Chair of the 
ACLU of Northern California.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A tireless fighter for civil liberties, Dellums spoke out against the 
death penalty, the criminalization of inner city youth, attacks on lesbian and 
gay rights, and the denial of services to immigrants and welfare 
recipients,&quot; he added.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">First elected to Congress in 1970 as an opponent of the Vietnam War, Dellums 
became a recognized expert in military and foreign policy and ascended to the 
Chair of the House Armed Services Committee. A strong proponent of the 
inextricable link between peace and justice, he spearheaded initiatives to end 
the Reagan-era military build-up and U.S. support for apartheid in South Africa, 
and challenged roll-backs in affirmative action and civil rights. As chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, Dellums led the effort to redefine national 
priorities through the budget process, always advocating for a more just 
America.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Laura Murphy, the first woman and first African American to direct the 
Washington National Office of the ACLU, is also slated to speak at the 
celebration. Murphy leads the team of ACLU lobbyists on a wide variety of issues 
ranging from cyber-censorship and other First Amendment issues to criminal 
justice, reproductive freedom, immigrant rights and racial justice. She was 
honored by the Congressional Black Caucus in 1997 and cited for her First 
Amendment work by Roll Call, the oldest paper on Capitol Hill, as one of the 50 
most influential Washingtonians in Congressional politics.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, the Lola Hanzel Courageous Advocacy Award will be presented to 
longtime ACLU-NC activist Steve Fabian, Deputy Public Defender of Sonoma County. 
Fabian has been a strong voice for civil liberties in Sonoma County for over a 
decade. As newly-elected Chapter Chair, Fabian launched the first Sonoma Chapter 
newsletter, &quot;Sonoma Civil Liberties,&quot; which today has a circulation of 
1,200. Fabian often appears on talk radio and television commenting on key ACLU 
issues such as immigrant rights, the death penalty, the &quot;three 
strikes&quot; law and censorship.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Steve's tireless activism, vision and leadership has turned the ACLU 
Sonoma County Chapter into one of the most successful chapters in Northern 
California, if not the country,&quot; said Grosboll. &quot;The Sonoma Chapter is 
one of the most active chapters in Northern California, playing leadership roles 
in the campaigns to defeat Propositions 187 and 209.&quot;</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Bill of Rights Day Celebration will feature creative works from numerous 
high school students including the &quot;Freedom of Expression Art Show,&quot; a 
juried exhibit organized by the San Francisco Chapter of the ACLU and highlights 
of the video &quot;Tribal Sovereignty: Uplugged,&quot; featuring the 
ACLU-sponsored journey of high school students to study tribal sovereignty. The 
highly acclaimed Berkeley High Jazz Combo will perform at the reception.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Tickets are $25 ($10 for seniors and students, free to students under 18) and 
are available by calling 415/621-2493 x46. The program begins at 3 PM and the 
reception starts at 4:30 PM. The event is wheelchair accessible, and ASL 
interpretation is available with one-week advance notice. The event is open to 
the public but seating is limited so advance purchase is encouraged.</font></P>
