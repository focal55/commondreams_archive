      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">COVINGTON,
        KY - December 30 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Two high school seniors whose school denied them National Honor Society 
membership because of their pregnancies must be admitted into the society, a 
federal <A href="http://www.aclu.org/court/chipmanvgrant_pi_order.html">court ruled</A> today in a 
case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Saying that &quot;the balance tips decidedly in favor of&quot; Grant County 
High School students Somer Chipman Hurston, 17, and Chasity Glass, 18, Chief 
Judge William O. Bertelsman, Jr. issued a preliminary injunction ordering the 
Grant County School Board to admit the students into the society for the rest of 
their senior year while they wait for their case to come to trial.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sara L. Mandelbaum, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU's Women's Rights 
Project, said that Hurston and Glass were both &quot;thrilled and excited&quot; 
when she telephoned them with the news.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This ruling is important in the immediate sense in that it will allow 
Somer and Chasity to include NHS membership in their college applications and 
allow them to participate in the many NHS activities planned throughout the 
school year,&quot; Mandelbaum said.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Significantly,&quot; she added, &quot;the court also made clear that 
the reasons put forth by Grant County school officials do not justify keeping 
these A students out of the National Honor Society.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In his 13-page ruling, Judge Bertelsman said that &quot;although the 
defendants argue that they are not basing their decision on pregnancy, but 
rather on non-marital sexual relations, the disparate impact on young women such 
as [Chipman and Glass] is apparent.&quot;</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Indeed, in affidavits submitted to the court, more than a dozen Grant County 
High School students who were admitted to NHS testified that no one connected 
with the society or the school had asked them whether they engaged in 
non-marital sex.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Mandelbaum said that the ACLU's next step would be to ask the court for a 
permanent injunction, to ensure that Chipman and Glass are considered lifetime 
members of the NHS. A permanent ruling would also set a legal precedent against 
any further incidents of discrimination in the state and around the nation, she 
said.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If the school appeals the ruling, the ACLU will fight the appeal.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite their top grades and records of high achievement, Chipman and Glass 
were the only students in the school eligible for membership to be excluded from 
the 1998 induction into the National Honor Society (NHS).</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In court papers filed on August 6, 1998, the ACLU said the school had 
illegally discriminated against the students, violating Title IX of the 
Education Amendments of 1972, the state and federal Constitutions, and the 
Kentucky Civil Rights Act.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Treating pregnant or parenting students differently from others discriminates 
against young women, the ACLU said, because all pregnant students are female and 
the overwhelming majority of students raising children are also female.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Somer Chipman, 17, was pregnant at the time of the honor society induction 
last April. She gave birth on June 1 to a daughter, Cheyenne, and married her 
20-year-old fiancé, Shawn Hurston, in August. Chasity Glass, 18, is the mother 
of 20-month-old Shelby. The lawsuits were brought on the students' behalf by 
their mothers, Brenda Jones and Sheila Glass.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Defendants in the case are the Grant County School District
(GCSD); District 
Superintendent James Simpson; Board Chair James W. Colson; Board Vice-Chair 
Marvin Smoot; and GCSD Board Members Janet Faulkner, Jim Jones, and Billie 
Cahill.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The case is Chipman v. Grant County School District, et al., filed in U.S. 
District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, Covington Division.</font></P>
