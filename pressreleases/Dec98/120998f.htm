        - December 9 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The UK Home Secretary's decision to order the application for extradition to 
proceed in the case of Augusto Pinochet signals the birth of a new era for human 
rights, Amnesty International said today.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders the 
world over could not have wished for a better reaffirmation of the principles 
contained in the Declaration,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Spanish government's submission of a formal request for extradition, the 
UK House of Lords' ruling against the former general being entitled to immunity, 
and this latest decision by the UK Home Secretary constitute some of the most 
important developments in human rights since the adoption of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Given the appalling number of human rights violations still taking 
place all over the world, this week's anniversary is a day of shame for many 
governments,&quot; the organization stressed, &quot;so it is profoundly 
uplifting to witness such a major step against impunity, particularly after a 
quarter century of struggle by victims and their relatives in Chile.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">After Jack Straw's landmark decision, the next step is for the Metropolitan 
Magistrate to satisfy himself that the Spanish, Swiss, Belgian or French 
governments have produced enough evidence to justify the extradition. Should 
this be the case, the Magistrate will order that the former general remains in 
detention, pending the decision of the Home Secretary as to whether to surrender 
him to the authorities of the four governments, or, if the Attorney General of 
England and Wales opens a criminal investigation, to keep him in the UK. It 
would be impermissible under English or international law for political, 
economic or other grounds to play any role in this decision.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Through his self-appointed parliamentary status, the 1978 self-amnesty 
law and special provisions in the Chilean constitution, Augusto Pinochet has 
built an impenetrable legal wall around himself and others accused of human 
rights violations -- making a trial in Chile virtually impossible,&quot; Amnesty 
International said. &quot;Today's decision takes victims and their relatives one 
major step closer to justice.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London on 17 October 1998 
was the result of a commission rogatoire (official petition to question him), 
filed by judge Baltazar Garzón of the Spanish National High Court (Audiencia
Nacional). Judge Garzón had been investigating cases of human rights violations 
constituting crimes against humanity, committed in Chile under Augusto 
Pinochet's regime.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On 28 October 1998 the UK High Court declared his detention unlawful on the 
grounds that he enjoyed immunity from prosecution as a former head of state. 
Amnesty International was granted leave to appear as a third party intervener to 
address the legal concerns surrounding the arrest in an appeal of the High Court 
judgment, which was subsequently brought before the House of Lords.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The armed forces under Augusto Pinochet's command implemented a policy based 
on systematic and massive human rights violations and large-scale repression, 
exerting absolute control over the resources of the State and using these to 
commit human rights violations, passing repressive laws, denying victims 
judicial remedies, using the judicial system to persecute opponents, placing 
society in a situation of total defenselessness, and generating an atmosphere of 
terror among the population.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These crimes against humanity committed through State terrorism activities, 
according to international law, are subject to the principles of universal 
jurisdiction. Also, the Organic Law of the Judiciary and the Spanish Penal Code 
contain provisions granting jurisdiction to the Spanish judges to try these 
crimes.</font> </P>
