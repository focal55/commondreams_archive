      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">SAN
        FRANCISCO - December 23 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumers Union criticized California Attorney General Dan Lungren for 
jeopardizing health care in San Jose when he gave the green light to the sale of 
nonprofit Alexian Brothers Hospitals to for-profit hospital chain Columbia/HCA. 
Lungren announced a settlement today with Alexian and Columbia, permitting the 
sale to occur if the courts approve. Consumers Union, along with community 
groups, will explore legal options to modify or set aside this 
settlement.</font><P><font size="2" face="Arial">For months, community groups, elected officials, and religious, union and 
community leaders have criticized the proposed deal for its negative impact on 
hospital concentration, charity care, and the quality, accessibility and 
affordability of health care in San Jose. In recent letters, elected officials 
and community representatives requested that the Attorney General not approve 
the deal until the public's concerns were met. Specifically, groups asked that 
Columbia agree to provide the same level of charity care Alexian Brothers has 
provided, in perpetuity; that the Attorney General conduct an independent 
valuation of the charitable assets and a health impact statement; and that all 
antitrust issues are resolved in a manner satisfactory to the community that has 
supported and depended on Alexian Brothers Hospital for many years. Groups also 
asked that the terms of any settlement the Attorney General negotiated with 
Columbia/HCA and Alexian be made public, and the community have an opportunity 
to review and comment on the settlement before any final action.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The community's opposition to the proposed deal was loud and 
clear,&quot; said Julio Mateo, Jr., staff attorney with Consumers Union's West 
Coast Regional Office. &quot;Today's settlement falls far short of meeting San 
Jose's health care needs.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In his announcement, Lungren stated that Alexian will donate $4 million to 
the O'Connor Hospital to be used to provide health care to poor residents 
currently served by Alexian Hospital. In addition, Columbia will make $15 
million in capital improvements to Alexian Hospital over the next five years, 
including $3 million to expand the emergency department; will maintain the 
emergency department for at least five years; and will provide $2 million in 
charity care to the poor residents served by Alexian for each of the next five 
years. </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumer groups believe the Attorney General should have required more of 
both Columbia/HCA and Alexian Brothers, especially regarding the provision of 
charity care and the preservation of charitable assets. </font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The health care needs of the people of San Jose will not evaporate in 
five years,&quot; said Diana Bianco, staff attorney with Consumers Union. 
&quot;In the last three hospital deals approved by Lungren, for-profit hospitals 
in California pledged to carry on a charity care commitment forever. Columbia 
should not be held to a lower standard. The San Jose community doesn't deserve 
less protection than other communities.&quot;</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The settlement allocates funds to services without an independent 
valuation of the assets involved in this sale,&quot; Mateo said. &quot;And it 
guarantees some services for limited time periods without the benefit of a 
health impact statement to identify the real services that are put at risk due 
to this sale. Because the Attorney General didn't do his job, we don't know if 
care for the poor will be increased or decreased.&quot;</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Columbia has offered to pay for the costs of enforcing today's 
settlement. Columbia should offer to pay for the costs of an independent 
valuation and a health impact statement before this deal is approved by any 
court,&quot; Mateo said.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumers Union questioned the details of the $4 million commitment to 
O'Connor Hospital.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Why O'Connor, and how exactly will that money be used?&quot; Bianco 
questioned. &quot;What is the mechanism to insure that the community is involved 
in decisions about how that money is spent? The funds must not be a windfall for 
O'Connor, but must be used for services above and beyond its current services. 
It must serve the same residents now served by Alexian Brothers.&quot;</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">To address antitrust concerns raised by the deal, Columbia will hold prices 
stable, adjusted for inflation, at Alexian Hospital for just two years.</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;While it is laudable that the Attorney General's office attempted to 
resolve this issue, we don't know if this method will solve the clear problems 
posed by the fact that Columbia will control 53% of the hospital beds in San 
Jose and 100% in East San Jose,&quot; Bianco said. &quot;If there are no new 
health care alternatives in two years and concentration remains the same, the 
price freeze must be extended, or the transaction unwound.&quot;</font></P>
        <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumers Union had also requested that Lungren refrain from allowing the 
sale, pending the outcome of an investigation regarding the inflated sales price 
of a hospital facility in Illinois that is part of the simultaneous 
&quot;swap&quot; between Columbia and Alexian. Alexian Brothers is paying 
Columbia/HCA $285 million for one Illinois facility that Columbia purchased in 
1992 for approximately $20 million. This translates into a $265 million - or 
1280% -- profit for Columbia/HCA in six years. Consumers Union asked Lungren to 
withhold any decision until the Illinois Attorney General investigates theses 
figures and determines whether Alexian Brothers board members may have violated 
their fiduciary duties by spending nonprofit dollars in this way.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We believe the Attorney General should not have given his approval to 
this deal with so many outstanding issues, and with no independent valuation and 
health impact statement,&quot; Mateo said. &quot;Lungren put the cart before the 
horse in this sale, and San Jose residents could suffer because of it.&quot;</font></P>
