        - December 3 - </font>Pharmaceutical and health products manufacturers led all industries in lobbying expenditures during
        1997 at $74.4 million, followed by insurance ($65.9 million), telephone utilities ($62.1
        million), oil and gas ($62 million), electric utilities ($54.3 million), and health
        professionals ($43.2 million), a comprehensive new report by the non-partisan Center for Responsive
        Politics reveals.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Influence Inc.: Lobbyist Spending in Washington, provides the most revealing picture yet of the
industries and interest groups that fund and deploy the army of lobbyists that is such an
important fixture of political life in Washington.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The study found that interest groups spent $1.26 billion - or roughly $2.4 million per member
of Congress - during 1997, the last full year for which data are available.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report breaks new ground by providing the first systematic look at lobbying patterns by
industry and economic sector, as well as a side- by-side look at political contributions. There are
individual profiles of each industry that include a list of the top 10 spenders on lobbying during
1997 and a synopsis of the industry's legislative agenda.</font> </P>

<FONT SIZE=2>

<P><font face="Arial">Among other highlights of the report:<br>
</font></P>
<ul>
  <li></FONT><font size="2" face="Arial">The financial sector (finance, insurance, and
  real estate) led the way both in lobbying expenditures ($177.1 million in 1997) and campaign
  contributions ($93 million in the first 18 months of 1997-98) among the 13 broad economic sectors.
  The health sector was second in lobbying expenditures ($158.5 million) and sixth in
  campaign contributions ($34 million).</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Some 218 organizations spent at least $1 million
  in 1997 to lobby Congress and the executive branch, including 41 that spent at least $5
  million and eight that spent at least $10 million.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial">A total of 101 lobbying firms reported at least $1 million in income during 1997. Topping the list
  at $18.8 million was the law firm Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &amp; Hand, which
  employs former Senate Majority Leaders Robert Dole and George Mitchell. Some $10.3 million of the
  firm's revenue came from just five clients - all tobacco companies.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial">The organization that spent the most on lobbying
  during 1997 was the American Medical Association ($17.3 million), which has been fighting to ease
  restrictions that managed health care plans often put on doctors.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Lobbying expenditures tended to fluctuate during
  the course of the year, depending upon the timing of events and flow of legislation and regulation.
  For example, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association spent $2.7 million on lobbying during
  the first half of 1997, but $7.3 million during the last six months, as global warming treaty
  negotiations that affect the industry were about to gear up.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Some organizations that do not show up on the rankings of top campaign contributors - such as
  the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. and the Business Roundtable - rank high on the list of
  lobbying spenders. Generally, these are trade organizations, whose members make political
  contributions individually.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Membership organizations that are generally thought to pack considerable lobbying clout on
  Capitol Hill, like the American Association of Retired Persons, the American Israel Public
  Affairs Committee, the National Rifle Association, and the Sierra Club, as well as labor unions,
  tended to fall far down the list of lobbying spenders. These groups can flex their muscle in
  Washington without paying for large contingents of expensive lobbyists by mobilizing their active
  memberships.</font></li>
        </ul>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"What is new here is that for the first time we can now put dollar signs on the total cost of this
massive effort," said Larry Makinson, the Center's executive director. "We can also tell, again for
the first time, which industries and interest groups are the heaviest spenders, and we can
compare lobbyist expenditures with campaign contributions - for a particular company,
industry, or an entire economic sector."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report is based on disclosures filed with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of
the House under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. The records were hand entered by Center
researchers and coded using the system the Center has pioneered in its study of campaign
contributions to categorize organizations by industry and sector.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The undertaking highlighted the limitations of the lobbying reporting system. Although the
1995 law requires the House and Senate disclosure offices to develop "computerized systems to
minimize filing burdens and maximize public access," registrants still cannot file their
reports electronically and the public still does not have access via the Internet. The Senate
disclosure office has shelved until late 1999 plans to put the lobbying database on the
Internet. Meanwhile, the office will not provide its computerized database to members of the public
or research organizations like the Center, forcing researchers to do their own data entry from
microfilm copies of the original filings.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to the report, the Center will post the entire 1997 lobbyist database in
searchable form at <a href="http://www.crp.org"> www.crp.org</a> on Thursday, Dec.
3, 1998.</font> </P>
