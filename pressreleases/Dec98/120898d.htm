      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - December 8 -
The following was released today by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL):</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Women in 
hate groups have appropriated feminism's struggle and are utilizing the Internet 
to peddle their racist propaganda. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has learned 
that among the hundreds upon hundreds of bigoted Web sites promoting a variety of
        hateful philosophies are numerous sites created by women who are
        distorting the 
struggle for women's equality solely for the propagation of hate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A new ADL 
report, &quot;Feminism Perverted: Extremist Women on the World Wide Web,&quot; 
reveals the contents of several women-generated hate sites, such as &quot;Her 
Race,&quot; &quot;World Church of the Creator -- Women's Frontier,&quot; and 
&quot;Women for Aryan Unity.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;These women-generated hate sites are 
publicizing hate on the Internet aimed at Jews, Blacks and other 
minorities,&quot; said Elizabeth J. Coleman, director of ADL Civil Rights 
Division. &quot;While female-oriented hate sites publish extremist screeds 
similar to those of their male counterparts, they are using the Internet 
primarily as a tool to promote discussion of their role in the white supremacist
movement. These bigoted women have appropriated feminism's struggle for the 
despicable purpose of spreading hate.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">According to the ADL report, some 
female extremists promote women's performance of domestic tasks to aid the 
&quot;movement,&quot; while others encourage women to work and become politically 
active. One task they all agree on, however, is that of raising racist children.
In the &quot;Knews&quot; Klan e-mail newsletter, Jo Kinder announced that
&quot;nothing can be more important to our cause&quot; than taking time to teach 
white children &quot;pride in their heritage.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Her Race</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">On the Her Race 
Web site, Nancy Jensen, a self-proclaimed &quot;staunch National-socialist female 
majoring in pre-medicine at an Ivy League institution,&quot; writes about 
equality between men and women in the extremists' struggle, even when it involves 
violent action. &quot;As for the issue of women physically defending their race 
or country,&quot; she writes, &quot;if they possess that desire and ability, then 
they should go for it.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Women for Aryan Unity</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Echoing Hitler's view that 
women should focus on &quot;Kirche, Kuche, Kinder&quot; (church, kitchen, 
children), the Women for Aryan Unity Website urges racist women to &quot;stand 
by&quot; their husbands by keeping their home, providing for their 
&quot;comfort,&quot; and indoctrinating their children with hate. The site 
instructs racist women to take up weapons and sound the &quot;battle cry&quot; 
only if their husbands &quot;fall.&quot;These women are upset that they have 
been taught they &quot;are no longer needed in the homes as wives and 
mothers&quot; and angered that they &quot;have been forced to compete with men 
for the males' jobs.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The World Church of the Creator -- Women's Frontier</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The World Church of the Creator points to Jews as Satan's
        children and deems 
Blacks and other minorities as subhuman &quot;mud&quot; people. Introducing 
&quot;The Mud Chronicles,&quot; the Church's Women's Frontier Website proclaims, 
&quot;We believe it is vitally important for White people-- especially our White 
Sisters -- to fully understand the bizarre, disgusting and criminal behavior of 
the inferior mud races.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">British National Party</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Sharon Edwards, writing 
on the Web site of the British National Party, encourages &quot;less fainthearted 
women to stand as candidates&quot; for public office. Though she claims not to be 
&quot;just another passenger on the feminist bandwagon,&quot; she believes it 
&quot;only right that women join our men in the battle to alleviate the perils of
        the present age&quot; and sees &quot;the contesting of elections&quot; as 
&quot;inevitably an important part of the struggle.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">As the leading 
authority on hate on the Internet, ADL has recently released ADL Hate Filter. This 
first-of-its-kind educational filter software product provides users with the 
option of screening out hate sites while obtaining information about the 
anti-Semitic, racist and extremist individuals and groups who espouse their views 
on the Internet. The League also has published several reports on the topic
including &quot;High-Tech Hate: Extremist Use of the Internet,&quot; &quot;The
        Web of Hate,&quot; and &quot;Warning Hate Zone: A Parent's Guide,&quot; all based
        on findings from the League's full-time Internet Monitoring Unit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">------   The 
Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, is the world's leading organization 
fighting anti-Semitism through programs and services that counteract hatred, 
prejudice and bigotry.</font></p>
