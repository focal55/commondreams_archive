Grassroots Movement to Challenge Wal-Mart Move to Supermarket Business</b></font></td>

        - December 2 -
A mass march on Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., staged from Kansas 
City, St. Louis and Little Rock is the beginning of a new neighborhood-based
        campaign to challenge the retail giant's takeover move in the supermarket
industry, according to the president of the 1.4 million-member United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) Doug Dority.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Dority outlined the &quot;Good 
Neighbor Campaign&quot; to more than 1,000 rank-and-file workers from across the 
country as they prepared to march on Wal-Mart's headquarters.  The campaign will 
focus on a &quot;good neighbor pledge card&quot; that will be circulated 
door-to-door, at churches, at community centers and union halls.  The card asks
consumers to use their voice, their vote and their dollars to support good jobs 
with living wages and family health benefits for their communities.  Consumers 
are also asked to pledge not to buy groceries at Wal-Mart.  Chanting 
&quot;Wal-Mart...Not In My Neighborhood,&quot; the workers signaled their 
commitment to take the program into their neighborhoods following the march.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">John Sweeney, president of the 13.5 million member AFL-CIO,
        joined Dority in 
signing the &quot;Good Neighbor Pledge,&quot; and announced that he would ask all 
union-negotiated health benefit plans to end the use of Wal-Mart pharmacies for 
prescription drug programs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The new movement to challenge Wal-Mart followed the 
company's plan to take over the traditional supermarket business with the opening
        of a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in Arkansas.  Wal-Mart has indicated
        its intent 
to spread the neighborhood market concept across the country.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Wal-Mart's 
takeover effort would destroy existing supermarket jobs, lower wages and 
eliminate affordable health benefits.  A new entry into the retail food business 
does not create new business or jobs.  Business and jobs just get shifted from 
one employer to another.  Most major supermarket chains pay living wages and
        provide employer-paid health benefits.  A shift of jobs to Wal-Mart
        would lower 
wages about $3 an hour and cut health benefits for most workers.  Six out of 10 
Wal-Mart workers are not covered under the company health benefit plan, and those 
that are, pay about $1,200 a year on an average salary of $7.50 an hour.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Women 
workers, who make up the majority of retail workers, could be devastated in any 
shift of supermarket business to Wal-Mart. Supermarket jobs are one of the 
largest single sources of jobs with health benefits for women workers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Wal-Mart has the money with over $3 billion in profits.  But
        we have the 
people.  We have the power in our pockets and pocketbooks to stop Wal-Mart from 
destroying good jobs.  We are going to mobilize that power to protect our 
neighborhoods and our communities,&quot; said Dority.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">------   For more 
information and/or the full text of speeches by Dority and Sweeney contact Greg 
Denier, 202-466-1591.</font></p>
