CDF and National Coalition for Homeless: After Welfare, Many Families Are Worse</b></font></td>

        - December 2 -
The Children's Defense Fund and the National Coalition for the Homeless today 
released a joint report showing that despite drops in welfare caseloads across
        the country, up to half of the families leaving welfare rolls don't have
        jobs. 
Among recipients who do find jobs, 71 percent earn less than $250 per week, less 
than the poverty level for a family of three.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The report, Welfare to What: 
Early Findings on Family Hardship and Well-Being, is a compilation of over 30 
state and local studies, plus recent local findings, and a new analysis of the 
latest national Census Bureau data.  It is the most comprehensive look to date at
        the well-being of the over 3.8 million parents and children leaving
        welfare since 
the signing of the 1996 welfare law.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;We must face the fact that families 
with extremely low wages do not earn enough to raise their children out of 
poverty.  Without help like child care, transportation, training, and wage
        supplements, families are one crisis away from joblessness or hunger,&quot; said
        CDF Family Income Division Director Deborah Weinstein.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">According to Mary Ann 
Gleason, Executive Director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, 
&quot;Families moving from welfare to unstable and inadequately paid jobs need 
far more support if they are to succeed.  States also must stop driving families 
off the rolls when there are no jobs available for them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">These measures will 
become all the more urgent when federal time limits and the next economic 
recession take hold.&quot; Gleason added, &quot;In many cities, easily one in 10 
families in homeless shelters say they are there because of welfare cuts.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The report finds that</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Many families leaving welfare report struggling to 
get food, shelter, or needed medical care.  South Carolina found that these
hardships increased significantly after families left welfare. Even when former 
recipients found jobs they had significantly more problems buying food than 
before, an indication of their very low wages.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Many families who leave 
welfare are losing income or not finding steady jobs at all.  In Wisconsin's 
lauded 1996 welfare experiment, for example, nearly two out of three former
            recipients had lower income after they left the welfare rolls,
            researchers found.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Extreme poverty is growing more common for children,
            especially those in 
female-headed and working families.  The number of children living in families 
earning below one-half of the poverty line($6,401 a year for a 3-person family) 
increased by 400,000 nationwide in 1997, despite strong economic growth.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Many families are not getting the basic help they need to
            find and keep jobs such 
as child care, transportation, food stamps, medical coverage, and housing.  
Further, many families are being inappropriately pushed off the rolls.  In Utah, 
half of families cutoff from welfare had barriers that under state policy should
            have been identified and addressed but were not, according to a
            retired state 
welfare administrator. One mother who was cut off for not participating in 
welfare to work activities reported she could not participate because she had 
back problems, no transportation, and her4-year-old son had neurofibromatosis.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">However, the report finds that some states and communities
        have created 
innovative and supportive programs to help families find stable above-poverty 
employment.  These include:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A Rhode Island program that provides child care 
help for all families with incomes up to 185 percent of the federal poverty line;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">An Illinois policy that reduces but does not eliminate
            cash assistance to 
recipients who work at very low wages;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">An Ohio program that locates child 
care at convenient transportation hubs; and</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A California program that 
provides access to community colleges for job training.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Why can't other 
states replicate these programs?  They work,&quot;said CDF's Weinstein.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The 
report outlines a series of federal, state and community recommendations, 
including:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Allowing education and training to count towards the work
requirement;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Giving states the flexibility to use federal welfare funds to
pay partial benefits when families work at least half-time, without those months 
counting towards the family's time limit;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Investing more federal and state 
funds in child care;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Investing in more federal housing subsidies, to 
address the housing needs of a record 5.3 million households who pay more than
half their incomes for rent and/or live in substandard housing.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">------</font></p>
