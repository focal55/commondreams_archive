        - December 18 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Environmental and consumer organizations called today for Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson to disqualify Yucca Mountain as the proposed site of a nuclear waste 
repository. The data within the Department of Energy's Viability Assessment 
(VA), released today, confirm that the site must be disqualified. Furthermore, 
the VA snubs necessary public involvement. <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>In the 
Viability Assessment, the scientific data supports the Petition to Disqualify 
Yucca Mountain, which 219 environmental organizations submitted on Nov. 18. The 
rapid water travel times from the proposed dump to the nearest wells supplying 
drinking water require the energy secretary to disqualify Yucca Mountain as a 
site to dump high-level nuclear waste. Several other concerns are likely 
showstoppers, including seismic activity, volcanic activity and geothermal 
upwelling. <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>&quot;We object to the content of the 
report for its optimistic conclusions.&quot; the groups said. &quot;Our petition 
has highlighted clear evidence of showstoppers. It is time for the DOE to stop 
the show and disqualify Yucca Mountain.&quot; <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>DOE 
models, despite their large uncertainties, predict massive radionuclide 
contamination, peaking up to 20 times above current radiation protection 
standards for other geologic waste dumps. &quot;It is outrageous that DOE will 
continue to study this site when their own data predicts excessive radiation 
exposure to citizens of our nation,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, the director of 
Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project. <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>Earlier 
this month, representatives of environmental and consumer groups met with 
Richardson to urge that the VA be written with an open democratic process that 
fosters public participation. However, the DOE has failed to solicit the views 
of citizens. <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>&quot;We are frustrated with the DOE's 
lack of effort in upholding the integrity of the process to characterize Yucca 
Mountain,&quot; said Michael Mariotte, the executive director of the Nuclear 
Information and Resource Service. &quot;The VA should be accompanied by several 
public hearings across the country in the many states that would be affected by 
this program.&quot; <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>The DOE says the VA is intended to 
present an assessment of Yucca Mountain at this time, but the agency has failed 
to allow for an outside independent peer review that is representative of the 
full range of concerns. The DOE should establish a convening body to select a 
representative group of peers across the full spectrum of issues and expertise, 
the groups said. <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2>&quot;The environmental community 
stands ready to nominate members of a convening body in an open process,&quot; 
said Hauter. &quot;We also look forward to the Nuclear Waste Technical Review 
Board's review, but we encourage them to not stop short of the obvious 
conclusions of Yucca Mountain that need to be drawn.&quot; <BR wp = br1><BR wp = 
br2>Recent independent cost estimates for the Yucca Mountain program suggest a 
shortfall of $25 billion. &quot;It would be outrageous for DOE to make the 
decision to go forward with more work at Yucca Mountain when the evidence in 
their own study - - a leaky mountain, leaky containers, and earthquakes - - 
disqualify the site. It is time to move on and stop wasting billions of 
dollars,&quot; said Ann Mesnikoff of Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy 
Program. <BR wp = br1><BR wp = br2></font>
