      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - December 5 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The President’s response to last Monday’s 
establishment of the Instant-Check system demonstrates his concern for public 
safety.  While the Instant-Check system for gun-buyers has some positive 
features, most notably the extension of the background check system to 
purchasers of long guns, it removes some of the safeguards which have made the 
Brady Law a success.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The most important of those safeguards is the 
waiting period for gun purchases, which has now disappeared in the 24 
&quot;Brady&quot; states.  In those states, as well in the states which have 
their own Instant-Check systems, purchasers will be able to walk out of gun 
stores with new guns as soon as they have cleared the FBI’s national database.  
Because the FBI does not have access to many local records, including vital 
categories like domestic-violence restraining orders and mental health, some 
prohibited purchasers will be getting guns.  And because the purchase is 
instant, people who are looking to commit crimes of passion or impulse suicides 
now have no barrier to almost-instantaneous violence.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">What is particularly troublesome, however, is the 
National Rifle Association’s newfound opposition to the system it insisted on 
creating. On Tuesday, the NRA filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, 
whose Instant-Check system will retain the records of gun purchases for some 
months.  Never mind that those records are critical for evaluation of the system 
– and never mind that new research demonstrates that a very high percentage of 
legally-bought guns are getting into the criminal market very quickly after 
purchase.  Despite the reasonable concern for thoroughness and public safety 
that underlies the temporary retention of Brady records, the NRA is more 
concerned about placating hard-line gunowners who object to any record at all of 
their transactions.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Additionally, the NRA is now objecting to the 
inclusion of long guns in the background check system – despite their original 
support of that clause.  In 1997, at least 10% of felony-murders, more than 9% 
of robbery-murders, and more than 10% of other murders that were committed with 
a firearm were committed with a long gun.  The same year, 29% of law enforcement 
officers killed in the line of duty were killed with a long gun – and statistics 
also show that long-gun ammunition is much more likely to penetrate the body 
armor of police officers.  Although handguns are more likely to be used in 
criminal violence, there is no reason convicted felons, wife-abusers and the 
dangerously mentally-ill should be purchasing rifles and shotguns.  Let us also 
not forget that the long gun category includes banned assault-weapons 
manufactured before 1994, including UZIs, AK-47s and AR-15s.</font> </P>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial">When we passed the Brady Law five years 
ago, it was with the overwhelming support of the American people. President 
Clinton’s determination to fix the Instant-Check system, and to make it the best 
possible system for keeping guns out of the hands of those who should not have 
them, deserves just as much support.&quot;</font> </P>

<P><I><font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah 
Brady, is the nation’s largest citizens’ gun control lobbying organization. 
Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns.  Founded in 1974, HCI has 
more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the 
country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws</font></I></P></td>
