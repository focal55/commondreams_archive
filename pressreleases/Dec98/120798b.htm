        - December 7 -
On December 10, thousands of concerned citizens around the country will mark the 
50th Anniversary of the landmark Universal Declaration of Human Rights. From 
Hawaii to Bangor, Maine, Americans will demonstrate their strong support for
        human 
rights by participating in citizen actions, community dialogue and celebration.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Many exciting activities -- from vigils and town hall meetings
        to tributes and 
interactive video teleconferences -- have been planned by widely diverse 
organizations with the support of a broad array of sponsors. Taking place 
throughout this anniversary week, these events represent a high point of the IN 
YOUR HANDS campaign, launched December 1997 and sponsored by the Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. These events present Americans across the social
        spectrum opportunities to take actions that will help eradicate human rights
violations where they live and around the globe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">William J. vanden Heuvel, 
president of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute said, &quot;On the 50th 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we rededicate ourselves 
to the protection of human rights. As Americans we have a responsibility to help 
end human rights abuses at home and abroad. Each person can make a difference. As 
Eleanor Roosevelt stated: The destiny of human rights is in the hands of all our 
citizens in all our communities.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">An historic national celebration to be 
held in New York City will be at the center of the day.  A national Town Hall 
Meeting will take place at the Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street,
        New York City, on Thursday, Dec. 10, from 2:30-4 p.m.  Human rights
        defenders from 
throughout the United States will join nationally recognized leaders to speak out 
at the meeting on key human rights concerns.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Caroline Kennedy will open the 
program.  Other noted spokespeople who will participate include William J. vanden 
Heuvel, president of the Roosevelt Institute; John Sweeney, president, AFL-CIO;
        Mary Robinson, United Nations high commissioner for human rights
        (invited); Felice 
Gaer, director, Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights; 
Charlotte Bunch, director, Center for Women's Global Leadership; and Roosevelt 
family members. Personal testimonies about violence against women, hate crimes,
        discrimination and immigration issues, women's rights, workers rights and freedom
        of expression, will highlight the ongoing effort to advance human rights
protections at home and abroad.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The New York City Town Hall Meeting will be 
broadcast live via satellite to Town Hall meetings and gatherings around the 
nation. In addition, several cities accessing the meeting will then conduct
inter-city, interactive discussion through cyberspace.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The 50th Anniversary 
celebration extends to the international level.  On Dec. 10, Anne Roosevelt, 
granddaughter of Eleanor Roosevelt, will lead a commemorative event in Paris, 
which is where the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Completed 
in 1948 as a response to the atrocities of World War II, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights outlined for the first time a clear and comprehensive 
vision of the basic human rights that all people have, simply because they are 
human. The human rights expressed in the Universal Declaration encompass the 
rights of women, children and workers; freedom from discrimination, torture,
        political imprisonment, and religious persecution, freedom from want, the
        right to 
a fair trial and freedom of expression.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Important human rights issues 
affecting a wide range of communities will be confronted at local town hall 
meetings. Human rights concerns in the United States include racial and other
        forms of discrimination, hate crimes, and violence against women, among
        others. 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is still vitally important for 
advancing and protecting human rights today. Across the nation the IN YOUR HANDS 
campaign calls for:</font></p>
