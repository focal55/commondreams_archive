    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - December 14 - </font>The Human Rights Campaign endorsed a
    boycott today organized by a San Francisco-based group, Equal Benefits Advocates, against
    United Airlines for their aggressive fight to deny gay and lesbian Americans bereavement
    leave, family leave and equal travel benefits. The boycott was also spurred by United's
    connected action with the Pat Robertson-created, American Center for Law and Justice
    (ACLJ), to bring down San Francisco's Equal Benefits Ordinance. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We have rarely seen anything so appalling in over a decade of
    gay and lesbian workplace organizing,&quot; said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch.
    &quot;It is particularly unconscionable that this airline is fighting bereavement leave
    for their employees. Clearly, United has redefined corporate irresponsibility and they
    ought to fasten their seatbelts, because they should expect a great deal of turbulence in
    the upcoming months caused by their unfair treatment of gays and lesbians.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In June 1997, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed
    a law that requires companies doing business with the city to provide the same benefits to
    workers with domestic partners as they give to married employees. United joined the
    Air-Transport Association, an industry group representing the nations major airlines, in a
    lawsuit seeking to ban San Francisco from forcing them to comply with the ordinance since
    most airlines contend that they only have to follow federal government mandates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In April 1998, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled
    that San Francisco could not require the airlines to provide health benefits and pension
    benefits to their employees and their employees' partners. But the judge also ruled that
    they would have to provide other benefits, such as bereavement leave and equal travel
    benefits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;United Airlines has elected to fight even these basic
    tenets of fairness in court, falsely claiming that extending benefits would place a great
    financial burden on the company. Particularly disconcerting to HRC is United's decision to
    align itself with Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice. This organization
    continues to vigorously attack public policy initiatives offering equality to gay
    Americans,&quot; said David M. Smith who attended a press conference today with San
    Francisco leaders and announced HRC's support of the boycott. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If there was any doubt as to where United stood on
    gay and lesbian equality, this was clarified when they elected to form a partnership with
    one of the most rabidly anti-gay organizations in America. In essence, United has joined
    forces with Pat Robertson to promote the unfair treatment of gay Americans,&quot; she
    added. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Human Rights Campaign asks its 250,000 members to
    follow the following guidelines in boycotting United Airlines:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Where a customer has a choice (and choice may be driven
    by price, use of frequent flyer points or availability of other flights), customers should
    try to fly another airline.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* If no choice exists, Equal Benefits Advocates requests
    the customer take the opportunity to educate United and the public by wearing a button or
    sticker expressing their support of the boycott.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* If United withdrawals their lawsuit, the boycott is over.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the last decade, dozens of Fortune 500 companies have
    extended domestic partner coverage to their gay and lesbian employees. Some of the most
    successful and fastest-growing companies in the nation have taken this step, including
    Shell Oil, Walt Disney Company, IBM, Kodak and Microsoft. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No airline has taken the full and final step of instituting
    domestic partnership benefits for its employees. United is the largest airline carrier in
    San Francisco, with 20,000 employees and 71,000 employees elsewhere. United's
    intransigence may force the city to evict the airline from their San Francisco
    headquarters. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's largest national
    lesbian and gay political organization with members throughout the country. HRC
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community.</font></p>
