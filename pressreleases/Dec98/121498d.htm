    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 14 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">As the
    Republican leadership steers Congress toward a fateful decision on impeachment that defies
    the will of the American public, People For the American Way today released new radio
    spots that will begin airing Tuesday evening in targeted markets nationwide encouraging
    Americans to call Congress and make their voice heard. The ads urge listeners to call the
    toll-free line (1-877-TO-MOVE-ON) that more than 130,000 callers have used since Dec. 9 to
    call Capitol Hill. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The congressional
    leadership is hoping the American people are too preoccupied to notice what's happening in
    Congress,&quot; said Carole Shields, president of People For the American Way. &quot;But
    the people are proving them wrong. Constituents are calling their representatives to say
    they will not accept this political assassination of the president, and our ads are
    backing them up.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;In the elections and in every opinion poll since
    then, the people have made it clear that they want Congress to move on - away from scandal
    and on to the people's business, but the congressional leadership has ignored them,&quot;
    Shields said. &quot;We have to beat on the door until Congress listens.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 30-second radio ads will begin running Tuesday, Dec.
    15, in media markets targeted to the districts of swing House members. The ads will begin
    airing in Philadelphia, Columbus and Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, with subsequent buys to
    be determined. The script of the ad follows on the second page of this release. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The toll-free number 1-877-TO-MOVE-ON was set up by People
    For the American Way as part of its $2 million pre-election ad campaign to give Americans
    fed up with Congress' continuing obsession with impeachment a way to make their voices
    heard. Callers to the number are routed directly to the congressional switchboard, free of
    charge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The number began operating on Wednesday, Dec. 9, and will
    be available until Wednesday, Dec. 16. The service is being provided jointly by PFAW,
    Working Assets Long Distance and www.moveon.org, the largest anti-impeachment Internet
    organizing group. Moveon.org has collected more than 350,000 petition signatures against
    impeachment and is continuing to forward tens of thousands of e-mail messages from its
    online members to their members of Congress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both People For and Moveon.org are using their web sites
    and e-mail to encourage Americans to call Congress and make their views known. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The radio spot can be downloaded from the World Wide Web
    using RealAudio. To do this, visit the following address at PFAW's website: <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/moveon/">www.pfaw.org/moveon/</a>&nbsp; </font></p>

    civil liberties organization. For more information or to arrange interviews, contact
    People For the American Way's press office at 202-467-4999. </font></p>
