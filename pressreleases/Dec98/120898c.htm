      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - December 8 - </font>&quot;<font size="2" face="Arial">The merger between Exxon and Mobil creates the largest corporation in the 
world and will lead to non-competitive practices that will harm consumers for 
decades to come. The trust-busters were right 90 years ago during the Teddy 
Roosevelt era when they broke up Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly into more 
than 30 companies. Lack of competition was bad for consumers then and it will be 
bad for consumers today.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Just because oil prices are at their lowest point since the Great Depression 
in the 1930s doesn't mean they will not rise in the future. Today’s prices are 
the result of a world oil glut exacerbated by the economic woes in Asia, the 
unusually warm weather in the United States, reduced consumption of heating oil 
in Europe because of a transition from oil to natural gas for heating, more oil 
production in places like West Africa, and the partial reentry of Iraq into 
world oil markets.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Currently, there is competition in refining and marketing, and that is also 
playing a role in lower prices. For instance, Venezuela's state oil company is 
providing Amerada Hess Corp. with cheap gasoline. Hess gas stations provide 
competition at the retail level. New Jersey, for example, has some of the lowest 
gas prices in the country.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">On the other hand, gas prices in San Diego are more expensive because there 
is less competition at the retail level. When Sell and Texaco combined their 
U.S. marketing operations, that had an impact on prices in places like 
California where some competition was eliminated. Prices are higher in Southern 
California than in the northeastern United States because there is less 
competition. Prices are lower in Los Angeles than in San Diego because there is 
more retail competition.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">If the first and second largest oil companies in the United States are 
allowed to merge, there will be problems for consumers down the road. These 
companies were once fierce competitors, and this will eliminate significant 
competition. Also, a merger of this magnitude will lead to other mergers and 
acquisitions in the industry. We could be left with just a handful of big oil 
companies, portending less competition at every stage of production.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Much of the oil industry is vertically integrated. That means one company 
owns and operates facilities in all phases of the production and delivery of a 
product. As the oil industry continues to consolidate, there will be less 
competition in extracting and refining oil. There must be at least five 
competitors to have even minimal competition at all levels of production and 
also at all geographic locations. There should be 10 competitors, at least, to 
have vigorous competition.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">There are many other issues. The impact on our democracy of creating such a 
large and powerful company will be negative. The oil industry already has a 
tremendous influence on public policy. A merger of this magnitude will create a 
super corporation that will have greater influence on government through the 
corrupt campaign finance system we now have.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">There also could be severe environmental impacts as well. Exxon and Mobil are 
actively engaged in opposing the Kyoto Protocol. A newly created corporation of 
this size will use its influence to try to stop any efforts to deal with the 
critical issue of climate change. The merger will also provide this giant new 
company with the resources to drill for oil in environmentally sensitive areas. 
There will be more pressure for drilling in the Arctic and deep in the oceans, 
rather than a drive to develop less-polluting energy sources and reduce energy 
consumption.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">This merger is good for the CEOs and Wall Street, because executives and some 
investors will make a fortune in the short term. It is not good for consumers in 
the long term, for the thousands of workers who will lose their jobs, or for the 
environment. The oil industry is a profitable business today. It is abhorrent 
that a few individuals should reap a huge windfall at the expense of 
consumers.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We call upon the Federal Trade Commission to carefully scrutinize this merger 
deal and to protect the public interest.&quot;</font></P>
