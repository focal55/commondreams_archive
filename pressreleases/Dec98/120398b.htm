        - December 3 - </font>In its annual world report released today, Human Rights Watch praised major advancements in human rights over the last
        fifty years, but called for an international system of justice to anchor that
        progress in permanent institutions. Human Rights Watch also criticized U.S.
        policy on human rights as &quot;subject to large blind spots,&quot; and noted that
        &quot;human rights concerns rarely ranked with the [Clinton] administration’s other
        interests.&quot;</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Many governments obviously still violate the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which will mark its fiftieth anniversary on December 10. But the possible extradition of Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain to
Spain has underscored the growing willingness of many countries to end impunity for gross abusers of human rights.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Pinochet’s arrest makes a very nice fiftieth-anniversary present,&quot; said
Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;But we need an international system of justice to ensure that no despot gets away with his
crimes.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Human Rights Watch World Report 1999, a 506-page book, offers a
synopsis of the human rights situation in 68 countries, as well as analyses of U.S.,
European, and United Nations responses to those abuses. Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring organization based in New York, with 150 staff
members and offices in ten countries. It was founded in 1978 and is the largest U.S.-based human rights organization.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In his introduction to the report, Executive Director Kenneth Roth noted that
governments can no longer ignore criticism of their human rights records, as they did fifty years ago. Now they feel compelled to answer such challenges
and justify themselves publicly. Human rights have become &quot;the legitimate concern
of the international community,&quot; said Roth.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, Roth noted, the notion of human rights now extends to many more
groups than the victims of political repression who were the original focus of the Universal Declaration. He pointed out that human rights protection now
extended to women, children, refugees, civilians in wartime, gays and lesbians, ethnic and religious minorities, and other groups who are victims of
discrimination.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Roth also expressed pride in the vigorous movement of non-governmental
organizations defending human rights. &quot;The movement did not begin with the declaration in 1948,&quot; said Roth. &quot;But particularly since the 1970's, there has
been a veritable explosion in the number and breadth of organizations devoted to human rights.&quot; These organizations play a critical role in forcing
governments to observe human rights standards, said Roth.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Roth called for the speedy ratification of the treaty establishing an
international criminal court, which was passed by 120 countries at a United Nations-sponsored conference in Rome this summer. So far, 59 countries have
signed the treaty. Sixty countries must sign and ratify the treaty for the court to come into being.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Judicial enforcement is the next step in advancing the cause of human
rights,&quot; said Roth. &quot;As we celebrate this fiftieth anniversary, we need to focus on
ways to end the impunity that most human rights abusers still enjoy.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Human Rights Watch World Report 1999 will be available from 9:30am
E.S.T.on the HRW website at <a href="http://www.hrw.org">http://www.hrw.org</a></font></P>
