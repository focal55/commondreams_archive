        - December 9 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">A new national study by researchers at the Urban Institute finds that most 
states are beginning to require participation in welfare-to-work programs by 
individuals who previously had been exempt due to a disability. Although the 
approach varies among states, at least 30 states have changed their policies to 
increase participation in work and self-sufficiency activities for this 
important segment of the hard-to-serve welfare population.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The study offers the first national overview of evolving policies on this 
issue since welfare reform was enacted in 1996. Undertaken for the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, <A 
href="http://www.urban.org/welfare/wel2work_es.html"><B>State Welfare-to- Work Policies for 
People with Disabilities — Changes Since Welfare Reform</A></B> was conducted by 
Urban Institute researchers Terri S. Thompson, Pamela A. Holcomb, Pamela Loprest 
and Kathleen Brennan.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Structuring appropriate services for welfare recipients with disabilities 
represents a challenge not previously faced by the welfare community. Prior to 
welfare reform, disabled recipients were generally exempt from participating in 
welfare-to-work programs. Under current rules, states can continue to exempt 
disabled recipients or they can require them to participate in welfare-to-work 
programs. When making this policy decision, states must consider the diverse 
needs of individuals with disabilities while still meeting new federal 
requirements, such as higher participation rates and a 60-month time limit on 
benefits. The decision is complicated by the fact that little is known about the 
prevalence of disabilities among the welfare population and that there is no 
single, commonly accepted definition of disability.</font> 
<P><B><font size="2" face="Arial">States Redefine Obligations for Individuals with Disabilities</font></B> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite these challenges, the study shows that 13 states had adopted a 
&quot;universal participation approach&quot; as of April-May 1998 that requires 
all recipients to participate in some activities—regardless of barriers to 
employment, personal situations, or disability. In these &quot;universal 
participation&quot; states, the concept of exemptions no longer exists.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">These states have set up an individualized case management approach that 
emphasizes recipients' capabilities and acknowledges that the path to 
self-sufficiency may be long. The activities required are varied and may include 
substance abuse treatment, vocational rehabilitation, mental health counseling, 
and even parenting classes. States see these activities as first steps toward 
self-sufficiency, although they do not count toward meeting federal 
participation requirements.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Another 17 states had broadened participation requirements to include some 
disabled recipients who were previously exempt. States adopting this broader 
approach to participation have done so in a variety of ways. For example, in 
some states caseworkers are taking a harder look at the capabilities of 
individuals with disabilities when determining whether they should be required 
to participate in work or other self-sufficiency activities.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The remaining states had left previous policies in place, with many state 
welfare agency officials reporting they still are in the early stages of 
identifying and assessing the needs of recipients with disabilities and 
determining what services can best move them towards self-sufficiency.</font> 
<P><B><font size="2" face="Arial">States Grapple with Imposing Time Limits</font></B> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The study also examines whether recipients with disabilities are subject to 
time limits on benefits—another important feature of welfare reform. Individuals 
with disabilities are now subject to such limits in 26 states. In 16 states they 
remain exempt, while in 8 states they face time limits only if they must 
participate in welfare-to-work programs. However, even in states where 
individuals with disabilities are subject to time limits, many states say its 
still too soon to tell what will happen when these recipients reach their time 
limit. The study finds that many states are in the early stages of deciding who 
will be granted a hardship exemption.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The report summarizes the results of discussions with welfare agency 
officials across the nation. A follow-up next year will produce detailed case 
studies of policies and practices in four states.</font> </P>
