      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON
        - December 8 - </font>The plan lays out a series of principles for legislative and
        administrative action that will form the basis of community efforts to strengthen the public schools by making sure that the public
        schools are adequately funded and that private and religious schools that receive public money under Milwaukee's voucher program are held
        to the same high standards of accountability and public reporting as the public schools.  This year alone, the voucher program has cost
        the public schools $22 million.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Parents and children shouldn't have to check their rights at the
door of voucher schools," said People For the American Way Foundation president Carole Shields in announcing the action plan.
"and Milwaukee's 100,000 public school children shouldn't see their schools starved for funds to pay for vouchers for a handful of
students."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The plan calls for immediate action to eliminate the artificially
imposed cap on SAGE schools that has denied thousands of Milwaukee's neediest school children access to this important and effective
program.  SAGE is a successful state program that reduces class size in low-income schools</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Milwaukee's children should have the same chance to succeed as
children in the rest of Wisconsin," said Shields.  "Eliminating this restriction is one way to start helping thousands of children right
away."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The announcement came as People For the American Way Foundation and
the NAACP kicked off a day of workshops and rallies at Mt. Zion Baptist Church.  The event was organized as part of a national
campaign in support of public schools and in the wake of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision not to hear the Milwaukee case.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">"Vouchers take money from public school students, give it to private
schools and abandon most of our children in the process," said Felmers O. Chaney of the NAACP "Our focus should be on making all of
our public schools the best they can be."</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Local school children also got involved in the day long event.
Milwaukee students organized and planned their own workshop focused on creating their own "action plan" in support of their public
schools.</font>  </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Other speakers included: Rev. Louis Sibley, III of Mt. Zion Baptist
Church;  Rev. Dr. Rolen L. Womack, Jr. of the Progressive Baptist Church; Wisconsin State Legislators Spencer Coggs and Gary R.
George; Roxanne Starks, president of the Milwaukee City Council of PTAs; Rev. Timothy McDonald of the First Iconium Baptist Church of
Atlanta, Georgia and other members of the African American Ministers Leadership Council.</font> </P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Partners for Public Education was launched by the PFAWF and the
NAACP in early 1997 to build support for public education and oppose vouchers and other policies that weaken the public schools.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Previous "Partners" events have been held in Baltimore, Philadelphia
and Chicago.</font> </P>
