      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - December 3 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">A macabre milestone in the history of the USA is about to be reached. At a 
time when people around the world will be marking 50 years of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the USA is set to carry out its 500th 
execution since resuming judicial killing in 1977.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Behind this statistic lies the brutal reality that US officials will, 
five hundred times, have taken a human being out of a prison cell, led them to 
an execution chamber and either hanged, shot, gassed, electrocuted or poisoned 
them to death,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;How many more people will be subjected to this cold-blooded ritual in a 
country which repeatedly claims to be the world's most progressive force for 
human rights?&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The affront to the Universal Declaration will come into stark focus on 10 
December, Human Rights Day. On that day, exactly 50 years after the 
international community adopted a vision of a world free from state cruelty, 
Texas and Oklahoma plan to execute Joseph Faulder, a Canadian national, and Tuan 
Nguyen, a former child refugee from Vietnam.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Five decades after playing a leading role in drafting the
UDHR, the USA 
continues to undermine that pioneering text by selling the message that killing 
is an appropriate response to killing.&quot; Amnesty International said. 
&quot;How can this do anything but entrench the cycle of violence in 
society?&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">A majority of countries -- more than 100 -- have turned away from judicial 
killing. But as the list of countries using the death penalty has steadily 
shrunk, the pace of executions in the USA has risen relentlessly. Whereas 11 
prisoners were put to death in the first six years after 1977, more than 300 
have been executed in the last six, increasingly by lethal injection.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For the past six years, the USA has killed an average of one condemned 
prisoner a week, in a dehumanizing routine of clinical killing.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The pace of execution is still not fast enough for some politicians and 
prosecutors, who continue to call for a speedier appeals process.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It is a disturbing spectacle at the end of the 20th century to see 
elected officials using the death penalty to compete with each other over who is 
toughest on crime&quot;, Amnesty International commented. &quot;Their energy 
would surely be better spent educating public opinion rather than pandering to 
opinion polls. It is time they had the courage and imagination to publicly 
question a punishment that is failing to achieve constructive solutions to 
violent crime.&quot;</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Hundreds of thousands of murders have occurred in the USA since executions 
resumed. Those who have been &quot;selected&quot; to die for their crimes by a 
capital justice system prone to race and class bias are overwhelmingly the poor 
and members of racial and ethnic minorities. In defiance of international 
standards, at least 30 mentally retarded prisoners have been among the 500 put 
to death Many on death row are mentally ill.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">In violation of international law, 12 people have been put to death for 
crimes committed when they were children.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The US authorities remain arrogantly dismissive of an international 
legal and moral consensus that such executions are wrong,&quot; Amnesty 
International said. &quot;We know of three executions of juvenile offenders in 
the world in 1998 - all were in the USA.&quot; Some 70 others remain on US death 
rows for crimes committed when they were 16 or 17.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The three juvenile offenders executed this year were all borderline mentally 
retarded, and were emerging from poverty-stricken, violent and abusive 
childhoods when they committed their crimes. According to Amnesty International, 
any signs of their rehabilitation or hope of their eventual reintegration into 
society were ignored to satisfy perceived public demand.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"><B>Background</B><BR>When executions first resumed, US politicians justified 
the death penalty as a deterrent to violent crime. With the failure of that 
argument, rather than exploring humane alternatives to judicial killing, they 
have turned to exploiting the concept of &quot;victims' rights&quot;. Responding 
to the fear and anger generated by violent crime, they lead, rather than 
challenge, the call for perpetrators to die for their &quot;cold-blooded&quot; 
crimes. Executions are advocated as a source of release from grief for relatives 
of murder victims. But an execution - itself a profoundly cold-blooded act - can 
guarantee no such healing.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Those on death row have been convicted of brutal crimes with tragic 
ramifications for the victims' families, which Amnesty International would never 
seek to belittle. However, the organization believes that all human beings -- 
regardless of who they are or what they have done -- are entitled to basic 
rights.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">More and more relatives of murder victims are also speaking out against this 
notion that a retaliatory killing brings peace. They believe the opposite is the 
case - that an execution does nothing to help family members come to terms with 
their loss, that it represents an appalling memorial to their loved one, creates 
more victims, and demeans society as a whole. Amnesty International believes it 
is time for politicians to listen to what they are saying.</font> </P>
