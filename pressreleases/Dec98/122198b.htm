<P><font size="2" face="Arial">December 20, 1998</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Ambassador,</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The first and immediate response of the United Nations to the criminal 
assault on Iraq by the United States, assisted by the United Kingdom, must be to 
end Security Council sanctions against Iraq. The Security Council has unleashed 
the scourge of war, taking &quot;peace from the earth,&quot; by its failure to 
prevent the use of U.S. military power, the second horseman of the apocalypse, 
against the people of Iraq. See, The Revelation of St. John, Ch. 6. The Security 
Council must act to repossess that power and effectively prevent its use again, 
or it will continue to violate the principal purpose of the United Nations 
Charter.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">For all the terror of the U.S. missile attack, its assault on life is minor 
compared to that of sanctions which create devastating hunger and sickness, the 
third horseman of the apocalypse. In November, the U.S. estimated 10,000 would 
die in Iraq from its assault. Even that figure pales in comparison with the 
deaths, sickness and human wasting caused monthly by sanctions. Sanctions 
against a whole people are genocide and must be prevented in all cases. For the 
U.N. to impose, or permit, such sanctions make it the enemy of the people. 
Already, since his impeachment yesterday, President Clinton has called for 
tightening the sanctions against Iraq.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">U.N. action now is absolutely essential to peace on earth. We see the fury 
rising among the poor, the Arab, the Muslim, all peoples of the planet who seek 
peace, by this U.S. flogging of Iraq. The assault is punishment, more than war, 
because only one people suffer death and injury.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">U.S. military technology, its destructive arms capacity and its expenditures 
for arms exceed those of the rest of the Security Council combined. U.S. 
research continues to seek surer ways to kill masses of people from afar. The 
next President of the United States whether elected, or by succession after 
impeachment, will be more bellicose than Bill Clinton, unless bellicosity is 
addressed now. Clinton has been a reluctant warrior. One need only compare his 
predecessors, the clamor during his impeachment proceedings and in public 
opinion polls supporting the assault on Iraq to know the lust for economic 
exploitation through military domination and coercion is virulent in the 
American body politic.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">To a degree Martin Luther King, Jr. never dreamed possible, his prophetic 
words in 1967 have increased in truth: &quot;The greatest purveyor of violence 
on earth is my own government.&quot; The American people are presently 
supportive of, indifferent to, or lacking in understanding and the will to stop 
U.S. militarism. Clinton has preferred economic exploitation by sanctions, 
&quot;free trade,&quot; debt servitude and fiscal coercion to physical violence. 
His successors will use the military power from U.S. weapons expenditures which 
exceed the gross national products of 25 Iraqs and contains omnicidal 
weapons.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">During this religious period in which the lunar and solar calendars of the 
principal contending faiths, Islam and Christianity, bring together their high 
holy days, the Security Council members must resolve to end sanctions against 
Iraq immediately and prevent the imposition of such sanctions ever again. 
Hundreds are dying in Iraq every day. Thousands are suffering physical sickness 
and injury and twenty million people feel the weight and sorrow of the mindless, 
heartless forced impoverishment that is killing their infants, children and 
elderly.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Each nation must refuse to abide by the sanctions, recognizing it is no 
defense to the crime of genocide to act under a criminal order, or resolution to 
commit it. Each nation should contribute urgently to alleviate hunger and 
sickness in Iraq and rebuild that nation so damaged by the criminal savagery of 
U.S. war and sanctions.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The people of the United Nations depend on you to do your duty.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Sincerely,</font></P>
