    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 14 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You
    don't have to be a pollster or a pundit to know that the people of this country are ready
    to move on with the business of the nation. Yet <a href="http://www.congress.org/">Congress</a>
    is tied-up in knots, with the House majority lining up to take partisan pot shots at the
    president and generally making a mockery of the constitutional standard of &quot;high
    crimes and misdemeanors.&quot;&nbsp; The President's behavior, offensive as it was, does
    not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In fact, the conservative majority in Congress, with their
    relentless attacks on women's rights, is a far greater threat to women and our families.
    &nbsp; Considering their antagonism towards women's concerns, perhaps it should not be
    surprising that they are seriously considering the impeachment of a president who not only
    was elected twice with overwhelming support from women, but also continues to have the
    support of the nation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Could their party, represented by an elephant, have already
    forgotten the voters' message only last month? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This House majority has become so enamored with their
    partisan game of chicken that they have forgotten who it is they were elected to serve.
    &nbsp; They are determined to thwart the will of the people with their continued abuse of
    the impeachment process.&nbsp; It is time for women to speak out strongly and in great
    numbers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Women must lobby against impeachment.&nbsp; We have spoken
    repeatedly in the public opinion polls.&nbsp; We registered our views in the voting booths
    in November.&nbsp; But apparently this Congress is willing to dismiss women's opinions.
    &nbsp; Every woman in the country needs to call her Representative with this message: Vote
    &quot;NO&quot; on impeachment and get back to work on the issues we care about! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The House has become a three-ring circus, but the clowns
    aren't funny and the new ringmaster seems distracted.&nbsp; It is time to bring the House
    Judiciary Committee's sideshow to a close, and for Congress to focus on important issues
    like improving Social Security and Medicare, passing equal pay initiatives, strengthening
    public education and funding anti-violence-against-women programs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 105th Congress has been a total loss for women -- this
    Congress turned back legislation to stop violence against women, to make our campuses
    safer, to extend quality child care, to put an end to hate crimes, to increase the minimum
    wage . . . On these and so many other issues, the 105th Congress has failed miserably. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is their last chance to do something good for the
    country.&nbsp; By voting NO on impeachment, they can give the nation a truly unique.&quot;</font></p>
