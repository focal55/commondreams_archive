        - December 29 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Building on the success of last year’s gathering, the Rainbow/PUSH 
Coalition’s Wall Street Project is preparing its Second Annual Conference. The 
conference will cover a broad range of business topics and feature an imposing 
roster of speakers, including President Clinton, who also addressed the first 
meeting. The conference will also include workshops of economic substance to 
build a new relationship between Wall Street and the black and brown 
communities.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">“We intend to replace the wall around Wall Street with a bridge,” said the 
Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., founder and president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. 
“We must greenline a redlined America  in order that we might share in this 
country’s growth, wealth and prosperity. At its core, Wall Street is a close 
circle of subjective relationships. But as customers, workers, pension fund 
investors, we have a right to be involved as trading partners.”</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The theme of the January 14-15 conference is <B>“Building Trading 
Partnerships to Expand the Marketplace.”</B>  All sessions will be held at 
Windows on the World, One World Trade Center in New York City. On January 14, 
there will be a Gala on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial"> “We can do as well on Wall Street as we do on the basketball court and the 
football field,” Rev. Jackson said. “All we need is the opportunity. We are 
changing our relationship to the world of capital.  We bring to the table 
underserved markets, underutilized talent and untapped capital.” </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">We are in the fourth stage of our movement for development.  The first stage 
was to end slavery, where all rights were denied. The second stage was to end 
legal segregation, which forced us into the margins. The third stage was the 
political franchise, which gave us the right to vote. And the fourth stage is 
access to capital and development.”</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Rev. Jackson emphasized the inclusive nature of the conference. It will focus 
those who have been historically locked out and left behind.  Speakers include 
those from the public and private sectors, business and labor, Democratic and 
Republican parties. In addition to President Clinton and Rev. Jackson, the 
speakers will include Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin, Citigroup Chairman and co-CEO Sanford Weill, Freddie Mac Chairman Leland
Brendsel, Inner City Broadcasting President Percy Sutton,  Rep. Richard
Gephardt, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and Jack Kemp, Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development during the Bush administration.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Small Business Administration Administrator Aida Alvarez, Federal Housing 
Finance Board Chairman Bruce Morrison and Federal Communications Commission 
Chairman William Kennard, Wall Street Project Chair Maceo Sloan, Council on 
Economic Advisors Chair Gene Sperling, Chairman and CEO of United Bank of 
Philadelphia, Emma Chappell, Leo Guzman, president of Guzman and Company, WJYS-TV owner Joe Stroud, Tom Burrell of Burrell Communications, auto industry 
entrepreneurs Mel Farr and Dave Bing, President of the National Health and 
Human Service Employees Union, Dennis Rivera, communications entrepreneurs 
Isaiah Thomas and Chester Davenport also will address the gathering.</font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The Wall Street Project works to open up real business opportunities and 
foster employment at the highest levels for those who have been shut out. 
Jackson noted that Wall Street Project efforts also have resulted in a growing 
number of minority firms doing business with each other and greater government 
attention to developing vehicles to transport capital to underserved areas. </font> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">“We’re very excited about our second anniversary conference,” said Chee Chee 
Williams, director of the Wall Street Project. “We have many more cosponsors 
this year. We are particularly pleased to have among our cosponsors minority 
enterprises that have benefited from our work.”</font>
