        NJ - December 4 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Bill Bradley, former United States Senator from New Jersey (D), today filed a 
Statement of Organization for a committee exploring a presidential candidacy 
with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The Bill Bradley Presidential 
Exploratory Committee was formed for the purpose of presidential &quot;testing 
the waters,&quot; Bradley said in his letter to the FEC. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Although federal election law does 
not require the registration of a committee formed for purely exploratory 
purposes, Bradley directed the filing &quot;in keeping with the spirit of the 
law and my own commitment to campaign finance disclosure,&quot; he said in the 
letter. Theodore V. Wells, Jr., a member of the law firm Lowenstein Sandler and 
a longtime Bradley associate, will serve as Treasurer of the Committee. </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am considering seeking the 
Democratic nomination for President in the year 2000,&quot; Bradley said in a 
statement. &quot;I would run to help unleash the enormous potential of the 
American people. I want to help take that energy and channel it, not only toward 
further economic vitality, but also toward finishing our agenda of obligations 
that we have to one another. We can move forward and affirm the basic goodness 
of the American people. We can realize our potential as workers, citizens and 
human beings.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Bradley said that the Exploratory 
Committee would be overseen by Douglas Berman as Chairman and Gina Glantz as 
Manager. Berman is a longtime associate who managed Bradley's campaign for 
reelection in 1984. Gina Glantz is the owner of the national consulting firm of 
Martin &amp; Glantz LLC. Ed Turlington, former Chief of Staff to North Carolina 
Governor Jim Hunt and Bradley's coordinator for the past two years, will serve 
as Deputy for Politics. </font></P>
