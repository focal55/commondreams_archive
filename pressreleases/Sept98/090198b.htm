        &nbsp; </b>- allows browsers to find out exactly how much the pay gap between men and
        women will cost them - and what they can do about it.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
        website is designed to expose the huge gap between men&#146;s and women&#146;s earnings
        over the course of a lifetime of work. The website allows browsers to enter their annual
        earnings, age, and education level and click instantly to find out exactly how much women
        stand to lose during their careers and the difference that belonging to a union makes. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The website also tells visitors exactly how many years of
        college education, day care, dinners out, back-to-school clothes and supplies, and weeks
        of vacation in Jamaica. The website provides a list of actions that visitors can take to
        fight for equal pay in the halls of Congress and in the workplace.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Greater public exposure can be a powerful weapon in
        fighting for equal pay,&quot; said AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Women in all lines of work - from clerical workers to
        nurses to lawyers to doctors to teachers - lose out because of the pay gap,&quot; said
        Gloria Johnson, President of the Coalition of Labor Union Women and a vice-president of
        the AFL-CIO.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The average 29-year old, college-educated woman will
        lose $990,000 because of the wage gap. With that money, she could have purchased 236 years
        of daycare for her children, had breakfast, lunch, and dinner at a restaurant for the next
        39 years, or taken a vacation in Jamaica for 14 years,&quot; said Karen Nussbaum, Director
        of the Working Women&#146;s Department of the AFL-CIO.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Studies have shown that the pay gap starts in
        childhood when little boys are paid higher allowances than little girls for household
        chores and continues through adulthood, crossing educational background, years of
        experience, and profession,&quot; according to Heidi Hartmann, the director of the
        Institute for Women&#146;s Policy Research which analyzed the data appearing on the
        website.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Fighting for equal pay for working women is one of
        the top priorities for the </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">AFL-CIO,&quot; said AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda
        Chavez-Thompson. &quot;Equal pay is not just a women&#146;s issue - it&#146;s a working
        families issue. That&#146;s why fighting for equal pay at the federal and state level is
        one of the top priorities on our 1998 Agenda for Working Families.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We are going to keep up the heat on the issue of
        equal pay. We expect a lot of women to log on to this website and join our efforts to
        fight for equal pay on the job,&quot; said Nussbaum. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nussbaum said that the Working Women&#146;s Department will
        release a new report later this fall in conjunction with the Institute for Women&#146;s
        Policy Research which will be the most comprehensive report ever done on the wage gap by
        state, race, and gender. It will also show how the wage gap impacts families as well as
        individuals. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Already, nine states have introduced equal pay
        legislation, and we expect to see that number double. We will work with local unions and a
        broad coalition of women&#146;s, civil rights, and religious groups to push equal pay
        legislation at the state level and will continue to lobby Congress to strengthen existing
        laws and enact new legislation that provides greater protections for women workers,&quot;
        Nussbaum continued.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because women earn less than men during their working lives
        - seventy percent of working women earn less than $25,000 each year - they have smaller
        savings and pensions when they retire. As a result of a lifetime of lower earnings, women
        are particularly dependent on Social Security - a fact which has heavy implications for
        the debate about how to reform the system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the national &quot;Ask a Working Woman Survey&quot;
        conducted last year, 94% of working women identified equal pay as their top concern. The
        1996 Women&#146;s Voices survey identified unequal pay and low pay as some of the biggest
        problems women face at work. Overwhelming majorities - 82% of women and 70% of men - said
        employers pay women less than men for doing the same work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The AFL-CIO, which represents over 5.6 million women, is
        the largest organization of working women in the country. </font></p>
