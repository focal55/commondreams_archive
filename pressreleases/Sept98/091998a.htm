    - September 19 - Calling Governor Wilson's signing of the Headwaters deal
    &quot;self-congratulatory,&quot; environmentalists said that while Wilson will point to
    the deal as an example of his environmental record, environmentalists are highly critical
    of Wilson's dismantling of environmental and public safeguards throughout his tenure as
    Governor.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Governor Wilson is becoming politically extinct and now he's trying to make up an
    environmental legacy. The real legacy is that he has pandered to contributors, who are
    some of the state's worst polluters,&quot; said Sam Schuchat, Executive Director of the
    California League of Conservation Voters. &quot;Throughout his tenure he has failed to act
    in the interest of a public that continues to support strong environmental
    safeguards.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Signing one bill to protect one forest doesn't make one an environmental governor.
    The irony is that if Wilson had instructed his staff to follow the law, protecting these
    forests would not have been an issue,&quot;said Rachel Dinno, Natural Resources Director
    for the Planning and Conservation League.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Governor Wilson deserves no credit for protecting the Headwaters Forest. The fact
    that there are any environmental safeguards at all in this legislation is due to the
    efforts of state leaders who insisted on protecting the trees over the Governor's
    objections,&quot; said Ted Nordhaus, Executive Director of Headwaters Sanctuary Project. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Pete Wilson's environmental record exists only in the minds of his PR staff,&quot;
    said Michael Paparian, Senior Regional Representative of the Sierra Club. &quot;The
    Emperor has no clothes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Wilson Record on the Headwaters Forest:<br>
    <br>
    Failed to Halt Logging in Ancient Redwood Forests The Governor's Board of Forestry has
    repeatedly refused to revoke &quot;salvage logging&quot; provisions that lift logging
    restrictions in old growth redwood forests. The Board held fast on rebuffing scientist and
    conservationist appeals, even when Charles Hurwitz began logging in the &quot;lesser
    cathedrals&quot; and was preparing to log Headwaters grove. <br>
    <br>
    The Board refused to stop Hurwitz' logging less than 2 weeks after the signature of the
    federal government-Wilson agreement in Sept, 1996. Logging began the very next week. These
    forests are now included in the 50-year protection of the improved agreement.<br>
    <br>
    The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF), has continually approved
    Pacific Lumber's logging plans for the redwood forests, despite warnings about severe
    environmental impacts from state and federal scientists.<br>
    <br>
    In Dec. 1997 CDF backed down on a decision to deny renewal of Pacific Lumber's operating
    license. The company had received 103 citations for violations of state environmental
    safeguards for logging, more than any other logging operator in the state, and threatened
    to &quot;log anyway&quot; if the permit was denied.<br>
    <br>
    Governor Wilson Refused to Protect Coho Salmon Habitat<br>
    <br>
    Wilson actively objected to list the endangered coho salmon and is currently seeking<br>
    to undermine the implementation of the federal listing in April, 1997. A listing would
    provide a foundation to enforce limits on logging and road building alongside streambeds.
    Furthermore, Wilson has refused to make any changes in the state forest practice rules to
    protect coho habitat.<br>
    <br>
    Wilson refused to complete Clean Water Act requirements for plans to protect streams.
    Citizen lawsuits were the only way to enforce him to do it. At a hearing in Dec. 1997, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency noted that regional water quality officials review
    only 10 percent of proposed timber harvest plans (THPs) each year, yet the Wilson opposed
    efforts to have THPs reviewed by boards and Department of Fish and Game.<br>
    <br>
    Also at the hearing on forestry practices and flooding in communities, state and federal
    biologists -- fearing reprisals -- testified that CDF officials repeatedly ignore their
    warnings that approved practices have undermined the environment, led to mudslides,
    damaged streams and cut into salmon populations.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
