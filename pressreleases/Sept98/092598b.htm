    - September 25 - Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association (NEA), and
    Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), today called on
    their members across the country to forge partnerships in their communities to strengthen
    America's teaching force. Both spoke at the opening of a national conference on teacher
    quality that the two unions are sponsoring.<br>
    <br>
    Calling teacher quality &quot;an integral concern of professional unionism,&quot; Feldman
    said. &quot;We have to make the improvement of teaching as much the business of the union
    as negotiating contracts and filing grievances.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Today's teachers face new demands and challenges,&quot; Chase said. &quot;Because of
    rising expectations about what students should know and be able to do, breakthroughs in
    research on how children learn and the increasing diversity of the student population,
    teachers need to expand their knowledge and skills to increase student achievement.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Addressing the participants, Chase and Feldman outlined the nationwide problems with
    teacher shortages and emergency teaching credentials, as well as research showing that
    teacher quality is one of the most powerful influences on student learning. Noting that
    teacher unions alone cannot improve teacher quality, both union presidents urged their
    members to work cooperatively with school boards, administrators, elected officials,
    parents and community colleges and universities to improve the quality of teaching.<br>
    <br>
    Conference participants will include teams of teachers, school board members, school
    superintendents, elected officials, parents, higher education faculty and others from more
    than 80 communities across the country. The conference is designed to enable these
    district or state teams to develop specific plans to help promote teacher quality when
    they return home.<br>
    <br>
    Conference topics include:<br>
    <br>
    -- Encouraging teachers to go through the process of certification by the National Board
    for Professional Teaching Standards<br>
    -- Creating peer assistance and review programs<br>
    -- Providing professional development to advance learning<br>
    -- Strengthening teacher education<br>
    -- Raising standards for teacher licensure<br>
    -- Recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers.<br>
    <br>
    Other speakers at the conference include Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education, and
    Linda Darling-Hammond, executive director of the National Commission on Teaching and
    America's Future.<br>
    <br>
    Feldman noted that many conference participants were already working on teacher quality
    initiatives back home, but she called on union members to &quot;work harder than ever
    before&quot; on the issues. She said, &quot;Because we came to teaching for only one
    reason -- to help children learn and grow -- we are fierce fighters on their behalf. We
    know that without unencumbered access to good teachers in a free, high-quality school, our
    children -- especially our most vulnerable children -- will have no future.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Chase urged conference participants to pay particular attention to the needs of new
    teachers. &quot;Many districts talk about putting a qualified teacher in every classroom,
    but in reality, too often there is a sink-or-swim policy for new teachers. The trouble
    with this approach of course is that when the teacher sinks, so do his or her
    students.&quot; Every new teacher, Chase said, should be assigned an experienced and
    trained mentor teacher. &quot;We should also provide them with intensive professional
    development -- as much as 20 percent of a new teacher's schedule -- tailored specifically
    to the needs of new teachers,&quot; he said.<br>
