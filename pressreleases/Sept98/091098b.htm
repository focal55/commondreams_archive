    - September 10 - According to a report released today by U.S. PIRG, industries reported
    discharging nearly one billion pounds of toxic chemicals into America's waterways between
    1992 and 1996. The report, <i>Troubled Waters</i> found that industries discharged an
    additional 141 million pounds into sewer systems, eventually being released to waterways,
    &nbsp; over the same five year period.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;<i>Troubled Waters</i> illustrates that polluters continue to use America&#146;s
    waterways as dumping grounds for toxic chemicals,&quot; said Allison LaPlante, U.S. PIRG
    Environmental Advocate.&nbsp; &quot;Many of the chemicals being discharged into our rivers
    and streams are known to cause cancer, birth defects, reproductive disorders&nbsp; and
    other serious health effects.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    U.S. PIRG analyzed toxic chemical releases to major waterways, as reported by industries
    to the Community Right to Know Act's Toxics Release Inventory. The Toxics Release
    Inventory data accounts for only a small percentage of toxic chemical pollution released
    into the environment.&nbsp; Due to loopholes in the law, major sources of toxic pollution
    are shielded from the public view, including data on some of the most hazardous substances
    known to science, such as dioxins, lead, and mercury.&nbsp; <i>Troubled Waters</i>
    concludes that the total toxic chemical dumping in our waterways over the last five years
    may be many times greater than Toxics Release Inventory reports.<br>
    <br>
    Other major findings of the report include:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The ten most polluted waterways were the Mississippi River,
        Ohio River, Brazos River, Connoquenessing Creek, Pacific Ocean, Houston Ship Channel,
        Savannah River, Tennessee River, Rock River, and Delaware River.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More toxic chemicals were dumped into the Mississippi River
        than all other U.S. waters combined.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">For 74 percent of waterways, one polluter accounted for all
        reported toxic discharges to water during the five year period.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The facilities directly releasing the most toxic chemicals
        were three fertilizer plants in Louisiana that released 450 million pounds of toxics into
        the Mississippi River--the IMC-Agrico Fertilizer Plant in St. James and Uncle Sam, and the
        PCS Nitrogen Fertilizer facility in Geismer.&nbsp; These were followed by BASF in
        Freeport, TX, Armco in Butler, PA, and Mobil Mining and Minerals in Pasadena, TX.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Millions of Americans rely on our waterways for
    drinking water sources, and swimming and fishing destinations. We have the right to clean,
    toxic­free lakes, rivers, and streams, and we have the right to know when polluters
    discharge toxic chemicals into our waterways. Without more complete information on the use
    and release of toxic chemicals, the public is left in the dark, and we cannot protect
    ourselves,&quot; said LaPlante.<br>
    <br>
    U.S. PIRG recommends the following actions to expand Right to Know as a first step toward
    reducing toxic pollution to our waterways:<br>
    <br>
    1) Right to Know should be expanded to include information on how toxic chemicals are used
    in the workplace, transported through communities, and contained in consumer products.<br>
    <br>
    2) Reporting thresholds should be set at zero for highly toxic substances such as lead,
    dioxin, and mercury to ensure reporting on the use and release of any quantity of these
    substances.<br>
    <br>
    3) All significant sources of toxic pollution should report to the Toxics Release
    Inventory, including sewage treatment plants, medical and solid waste incinerators, and
    the oil and gas industry.<br>
    <br>
    4) The Clean Water Act should be strengthened to require polluters to eliminate toxic
    discharges, prevent polluted run­off, and ensure strict compliance with the law.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;While the polluters continue to dump millions of pounds of toxic chemicals into our
    waterways, Members of Congress are working to attach dozens of anti-environmental
    provisions to must-pass spending bills.&nbsp; Instead of working to weaken our
    environmental laws, we urge Congress to listen to the public&#146;s demands for clean
    water and the right to know about toxic chemical use and pollution,&#148; said LaPlante.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We urge President Clinton to use all existing legal authority to continue to expand
    the public's right to know about toxic chemicals, and we urge Members of Congress to
    support H.R. 1636 and S.769 that would fill in many important Right to Know reporting
    gaps,&#148; said LaPlante.</font></p>
