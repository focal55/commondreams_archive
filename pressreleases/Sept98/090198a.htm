        <td><font face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - September 1 - As political and religious
        conservatives increase public attacks on gays and lesbians, the American Civil Liberties
        Union today asked Americans to consider the morality of bigotry.<br>
        <br>
        In the sixth installment of its public policy advertising campaign running on the op-ed
        page of The New York Times and The New Republic, the ACLU points out that morality was
        once used as a justification for widespread discrimination against African Americans.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Belief in the innate immorality of black people, buttressed by selected scriptural
        references, formed the basis for slavery, segregation and lynchings,&quot; today's
        advertisement says.<br>
        <br>
        The year-long advertising campaign, a first-ever effort for the 78-year-old organization,
        runs on The New York Times op-ed page once a month through December 1998. Each ad contains
        a briefly worded message from ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser on topical subjects
        ranging from the war on drugs to religious freedom to government intrusions in the
        bedroom.<br>
        <br>
        Linking the campaign theme of public vs. private morality to today's ad, Glasser pointed
        out that claims of moral inferiority have been used throughout American history as a
        justification for denying civil rights to disenfranchised groups.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;We were once told that it would be immoral for women to work or vote. Jews, Irish,
        Italians -- virtually every immigrant group in fact -- were once said to be morally
        inferior,&quot; he said. &quot;Any time we hear discrimination justified by claims that
        its victims are immoral, we should remember this regrettable part of our history.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The latest round of attacks on lesbians and gay men come in the wake of recent legal and
        legislative civil rights victories. Just last month, the House overwhelmingly rejected an
        anti-gay measure that would have permitted discrimination against gay men and lesbians
        employed by the federal government. And in a landmark 1996 decision, the Supreme Court for
        the first time ruled that the government may not treat lesbians and gay men differently
        simply out of hostility or fear.<br>
        <br>
        Political operatives and religious extremists are now determined to take back those
        victories, the ACLU said. Leading the fight is Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-MS,
        who in a recent television interview equated homosexuality with &quot;sins&quot; like
        &quot;kleptomania&quot; and &quot;alcoholism.&quot; Backing him up, House Majority Leader
        Dick Armey, R-TX, assured the public that &quot;the Bible is very clear on this.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Saying that homosexuality is a matter of &quot;lifestyle&quot; choice, a coalition of
        Christian conservative groups have placed a series of full-page ads in major newspapers
        making the scientifically rejected claim that gays can be &quot;converted.&quot; In a
        recent interview with the Times, one of the architects of the &quot;conversion&quot; ad
        campaign said the advertising ploy was intended to strike at the assumption that
        homosexuality is immutable and that gay people therefore need protection under
        anti-discrimination laws.<br>
        <br>
        The so-called &quot;conversion&quot; ad campaign is clearly an attempt to set up a phony
        debate over whether gay men and lesbians can, in fact, change, Glasser said. The real
        issue, he said, is whether loving someone of the same sex should condemn lesbians and gay
        men to random violence, harassment, job and housing discrimination and loss of rights as a
        parent.<br>
        <br>
        In the ACLU op-ed ad, Glasser concludes: &quot;Sure, they can try to hide behind morality,
        but we all know a bigot when we see one. Think about it.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        To further stimulate public discussion, the ads will have an interactive component through
        &quot;message boards&quot; on the ACLU's Freedom Network Website at <a href="http://www.aclu.org/features/nytimesad090198.html">http://www.aclu.org/features/nytimesad090198.html</a>
        . Visitors to the website will be able to access background information on the subject of
        that month's ad, and will be invited to post their own thoughts to an interactive message
        board.<br>
        <br>
        The remaining ACLU ads are scheduled to run one Tuesday a month on October 6, November 10,
        and December 1.<br>
        <br>
        The ACLU is a nationwide, non-partisan organization dedicated to defending and preserving
        the Bill of Rights for all individuals through litigation, legislation and public
        education. Headquartered in New York City, the ACLU has 53 staffed affiliates in major
        cities, more than 300 chapters nationwide, and a legislative office in Washington.<br>
        <br>
        The bulk of its $35 million annual budget is raised by contributions from members --
        275,000 strong -- and gifts and grants from other individuals and foundations. The ACLU
        does not accept government funds.<br>
        <br>
