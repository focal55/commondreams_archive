    - September 30 - The U.S. Senate voted 96-0 to pass the Higher Education Reauthorization
    Act.&nbsp; A part of this bill, which was taken from the Campus Right to Know Act, will
    require campus police to report incidents of hate crimes on the basis of sexual
    orientation, disability, religion, gender and ethnicity.&nbsp; The bill is an important
    step in providing students access to information allowing them to choose a school in which
    they will be safe, according to the Human Rights Campaign.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This legislation sends the clear message
    that hate crimes are serious offenses and should not be swept under the carpet.&nbsp; This
    open policy allows gay and lesbian students to know if they may be at higher risk by
    attending certain schools.&nbsp; This legislation also allows schools with a high
    incidence of hate crimes to identify their problems and fix<br>
    them,&quot; said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House passed the bill the day before by a
    voice vote and now it will go to President Clinton who is expected to sign it into law.
    &nbsp; Before this legislation, existing federal reporting requirements only mandated
    colleges and universities to report hate crimes that result in murder, rape, or aggravated
    assault.&nbsp; This was inadequate because the majority of hate crimes on campuses are not
    this extreme.&nbsp; Most incidents come in the form of assaults, or lesser crimes.
    &nbsp; Unfortunately, vandalism and intimidation as incidents that campus police must
    report to the Department of Education were not included in this bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes
    Statistics Act (HCSA) in an effort to measure the extent of the hate crime problem in
    America.&nbsp; In 1992, Congress enacted the Campus Security Act to require colleges and
    universities to annually report crime statistics in an effort to measure campus crime and
    increase security awareness.&nbsp; With the passage of this section of the Higher
    Education Reauthorization Act,&nbsp; campus police will now also report incidents of hate
    crimes on the basis of sexual orientation, disability, religion, gender and ethnicity.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The first step to solving a problem is
    acknowledging it exists.&nbsp; This bill will provide the necessary tools for college
    administrators to recognize that their institutions may be incubators for hateful
    activity,&quot; said HRC senior policy advocate Kris Pratt. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the largest
    national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country. It
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community.
