    - September 17 - Students who obtain credit cards at on-campus tables carry larger
    balances and pay off their cards later than those who do not, according to the results of
    a nationwide survey of college students released today by the U.S. Public Interest
    Research Group (PIRG). The group issued a new fact sheet for college students and also
    called on colleges to regulate credit card marketing on campus and do a better job of
    educating students about credit card debt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Students, especially those who fill out credit card applications at campus tables in
    return for trinkets and candy, run the risk of falling into the campus credit card
    trap,&quot; said Ed Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG Consumer Program Director. &quot;Students,
    often without jobs and often facing large student loan and other school debts, should be
    careful not to make things worse by running up unnecessary, high-cost credit card debt,
    since they risk ruining their credit records if they fail to pay on time.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Meanwhile, the credit card industry has poured millions of dollars into a campaign
    to get Congress to make it easier for them to collect unpaid credit card debts from the
    bankrupt victims of their high-pressure marketing of high-interest credit cards,&#148;
    Mierzwinski added. &quot;Instead of approving the special interest, so- called bankruptcy
    reform bill on the Senate floor, the Congress should impose tough sanctions on misleading
    and deceptive credit card marketing.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &#147;To avoid becoming the next victims of the industry&#146;s sleazy marketing of
    over-priced cards, students who desire credit cards should obtain them when they can
    afford them and should get them based on the best interest rate terms,&quot; added
    Mierzwinski, &quot;They shouldn't apply for a credit card just to obtain a frisbee or
    free-bee or bottle of soda at a campus table.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Among the national results of &quot;The Campus Credit Card Trap,&quot; a spring 1998
    survey of 1260 undergraduate students at 15 campuses were the following:<br>
    <br>
    STUDENTS WHO HAD OBTAINED CARDS AT CAMPUS TABLES HAD MORE CARDS AND HIGHER BALANCES THAN
    THOSE WHO HAD NOT.<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Students responsible for their own cards who obtained cards
        at campus tables had more cards (2.6) than those who had not (2.1) and had higher unpaid
        balances ($1039) than those who had not ($854).<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More students responsible for their own cards who obtained
        cards at campus tables reported carrying unpaid balances (42%) than those who had not
        (35%). <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Those students responsible for their own cards who had
        obtained cards at campus tables and carried balances had higher unpaid balances ($1460)
        than those who had not ($1206).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">CREDIT CARD MARKETING ON CAMPUS:<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Students reported obtaining gifts ranging from T-shirts and
        Frisbees to coffee mugs, slinkees, and candy or bottles of soda in return for filling out
        applications at tables. According to students, campus groups sponsoring the tables often
        receive either flat fees or per-application payments from the credit card companies as
        well.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More than half of students (61%) responsible for their own
        bills reported they had obtained cards at campus tables while fewer than half of those who
        reported that their parents helped with payments (41%) obtained cards at tables. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">MOST STUDENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CARDS<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most students surveyed (69%) obtained credit cards in their
        own names, while the others (31%) said that their parents either paid their primary credit
        card bills or co-signed at least one of their cards. Of those who obtained cards in their
        own names, only 15% reported holding a full-time job when they applied.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Thirty-eight percent (38%) of the students responsible for
        their own cards report paying their balance off each month. Thirty-six percent (36%) pay
        &#147;as much as they can.&#148; However, the remaining students responsible for their own
        bills -- more than a quarter of the total -- report that they pay either the minimum only
        (16%) or pay late (9%).<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Overall, students responsible for their own cards had
        average unpaid balances of $968; however, students who reported carrying over a balance
        had unpaid balances of $1,366.<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">CREDIT CARD EDUCATION INADEQUATE<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Only 41% of all students found credit card education
        materials &quot;helpful&quot; or &quot;somewhat helpful.&quot; Over one-quarter of
        students (26%) found introductory &quot;teaser rates&quot; misleading. <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When asked how long it would take to pay off a $1,000 credit
        card debt at an 18% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and only making the minimum required
        payment of 3%, only 20% of all students guessed the correct answer, six years.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">While 79% of all students reported using credit cards for
        multiple purposes, from campus expenses to shopping, only 13% reported limiting credit
        card use to emergencies.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to figures from the Department of Education, the
    amount of money borrowed by students increased by 11% last year, totaling over $38
    billion. PIRG's Higher Education Project estimates that with continued increases in
    student borrowing, the average student borrower entering school this year will graduate
    with approximately $20,000 of student debt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;With credit card debt stacked on top of student loan debt, these results should be
    alarming for students, parents and educators.&quot; said Ivan Frishberg, Director of
    PIRG's Higher Education Project.<br>
    <br>
    The PIRG report called on colleges to regulate campus credit card marketing and do a
    better job of educating students about credit card and other debts. Among PIRG's
    recommendations were the following:<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Colleges should prohibit credit card companies from offering
        trinkets to students for filling out applications unless the student has first read a
        credit card education brochure prepared by either the college or a non-profit credit
        education organization.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Colleges should include credit card and debt education
        materials in brochures inserted in bookstore shopping bags. Credit card and debt education
        and counseling sessions should be made a regular part of campus programming, including new
        student orientation programs.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Colleges should review and consider limiting the total
        number of credit card tables allowed on campus each semester.<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Along with the report, PIRG released a new fact sheet for
    college students, with tips on avoiding the credit card trap. Among the fact sheet's
    recommendations to students:<br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Study the benefits and risks of credit card debt before you
        apply. If you decide you need a card and can handle it responsibly, then consider the
        following:<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">One national credit card is all you need to help you build a
        credit record, if you pay it off on time. You can build a credit record without carrying
        an unpaid balance.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you must carry a balance, always pay as much as you can
        afford, every month. Never pay only the minimum balance, or you'll have trouble paying
        down the card.<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">PIRG also urged Congress to enact legislation, such as HR
    1975 (Joe Kennedy-D-MA) to rein in unfair credit card marketing practices. However, PIRG
    condemned bankruptcy legislation, S. 1301, proposed by Mastercard and Visa, that is under
    consideration on the Senate floor this week. An even more one-sided companion bill has
    already passed the House.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Responsible use of credit cards can help college students build a credit record that
    will help them get car loans and mortgages after they graduate,&quot; concluded
    Mierzwinski. &quot;But it is up to students to protect themselves from unwise credit card
    debts, because no one else will.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    PIRG student volunteers asked students with credit cards to fill out surveys in student
    centers in the spring of 1998 at a representative sample of 15 college campuses
    nationally, including large and small, public and private, 4-year residential and 2-year
    community colleges.</font></p>
