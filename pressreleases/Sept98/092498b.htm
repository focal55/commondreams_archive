    - September 24 - A wide array of leaders of the women's movement have joined together
    today to make a united statement about the possible impeachment of President Clinton by
    the Congress and about what is at stake for women in this country. <br>
    <br>
    We are appalled by the extremely partisan cast that this process has already taken. The
    rush to publish the Starr Report and to broadcast secret grand jury testimony -- before
    even a decision is made to proceed with impeachment hearings -- is a failure of fairness
    and has violated the fundamental value of due process. <br>
    <br>
    We are witnessing a relentless campaign -- both inside and outside the government -- to
    hound President Clinton out of office. This is destabilizing for our country and our
    democracy. And some of those who are leading the charge against Mr. Clinton are among the
    worst foes of women's rights. The opponents of the President have a political agenda that
    will harm women long after the scandal has faded from the front pages. <br>
    <br>
    We are here today to sound the alarm that if disgust with the current crisis depresses
    women's votes in November, we will see an anti-women's rights majority in Congress roll
    back the gains for women of the past 30 years. <br>
    <br>
    While women are angry and do not condone his conduct, women want President Clinton to
    remain in office. We believe, and the women of the nation concur, that Mr. Clinton's
    actions are not impeachable. His misdeeds are not of the nature of high crimes and
    misdemeanors required by our Constitution for impeachment of the president. <br>
    <br>
    Gender gaps in public opinion poll results persist, with more women than men opposing Mr.
    Clinton's impeachment, supporting his policies, and approving of his presidency and
    leadership. <br>
    <br>
    As feminist leaders, we will not stand idly by while a Congress made up of nearly 90
    percent men attempts to remove the first president elected by women voters. While
    President Clinton's record for women's rights is less than perfect, on balance women have
    had an ally in the White House. If this reactionary campaign succeeds, the unfinished
    agenda of women on equality in Social Security, pay equity, childcare, anti-poverty
    remedies, minimum wage, Medicare, real campaign finance reform which opens the system to
    women and people of color, and laws against violence against women will continue to
    languish in Congress. <br>
    <br>
    Not only are we standing united, we are urging action. We are urging the women and men of
    this nation to call their members of the House of Representatives to urge them not to
    proceed with impeachment hearings and to call their Senators to oppose the removal of the
    President from office. <br>
    <br>
    Most importantly, it is more crucial now than ever that women vote in the November
    elections. We must not let women's rights opponents sail to victory because women do not
    vote. <br>
    <br>
    Women have much at stake in this election. If women's rights advocates lose three seats in
    the Senate, we could lose the ability to prevent the override of a presidential veto.
    President Clinton's veto is all that stands between Congress and women's right to
    abortion. If the presidential veto cannot be sustained after the election, it could mean
    open season not only on women's rights but also on affirmative action, Social Security,
    gun control, civil rights, and equal education opportunities. <br>
    <br>
    Little has been said about the process of succession to the presidency. Many people ask
    us: &quot;What does it matter if President Clinton leaves office? Wouldn't Vice President
    Gore simply assume the presidency?&quot; We firmly believe that the ultra-conservatives
    will not stop at removing Mr. Clinton from office. Already Mr. Gore is under attack. Women
    should be asking the question, &quot;Who's on 3rd?,&quot; -- who is next in the line of
    succession? Next in line is Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. <br>
    <br>
    The Gingrich Congress has been an unmitigated disaster for women. The Gingrich Congress
    has voted 97 times this session to restrict abortion rights and is now trying to prevent
    approval of RU 486, the early abortion pill. The Gingrich Congress is trying to defund
    family planning programs, has ignored the Violence Against Women Act II, and has buried
    the patients' bill of rights. Pay equity and childcare have not been allowed to see the
    light of day. The specter of a Gingrich presidency is even more horrifying. <br>
    <br>
    We call upon women to raise their voices to protest this assault on fairness and the
    democratic process and to let the Congress know how strongly women oppose impeachment.
    Women must demand that candidates tell us where they stand on our issues and vote in
    November to turn out of office the anti-women's rights majority in Congress. We call upon
    Congress to end this hypocritical voyeurism and get back to work on the real issues that
    face this country. <br>
