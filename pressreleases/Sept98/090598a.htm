    - September 4 -In a major new report released today, Human Rights Watch warns that if the
    current political opening in Indonesia is not followed by legal and institutional
    protections for basic rights, the entire reform effort could unravel. The new report,
    &quot;Academic Freedom in Indonesia: Dismantling Soeharto-Era Barriers,&quot; is a study
    of the legal and institutional mechanisms used by the Soeharto government to silence
    campus critics, arbitrarily limit public debate on pressing social issues, and stymie
    intellectual inquiry. According to the report, most of those controls are still in place.
    &quot;If there is to be lasting reform in Indonesia, the government must confront
    Soeharto's authoritarian legacy head on, and this is the place to begin,&quot; said Human
    Rights Watch researcher Joseph Saunders.<br>
    <br>
    Although the New Order government was not uniformly hostile to the academic community, it
    was always suspicious of students and academics. The social role of the university as a
    center of inquiry and debate made it an important target of military and government
    controls. Noting the eruption of long-suppressed voices since Soeharto's resignation, Mr.
    Saunders cautioned: &quot;There was a similar opening during the last political transition
    in Indonesia in the late 1960s, but it didn't last because it wasn't followed by legal and
    institutional change. Our goal in releasing this report is to encourage the government to
    do things differently this time.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The militarization of Indonesian society under Soeharto had devastating consequences for
    free inquiry and expression. The report calls for an end to military intervention in
    campus affairs, including intelligence gathering on campus, the use of campus-based
    &quot;Student Regiments&quot; to monitor and intimidate other students, and indiscriminate
    and punitive attacks on student demonstrators. It urges continued investigation into the
    military's role in the abduction, torture, and possible murder of student activists
    earlier this year and calls on the government to punish to the full extent of the law
    military officers found responsible for the abductions. The report also calls for formal
    repeal of ministerial decrees known collectively as &quot;Normalization of Campus Life --
    Coordinating Body for Student Affairs&quot; (Normalisasi Kehidupan Kampus -- Badan
    Koordinasi Kemahasiswaan or NKK/BKK) and all other decrees that prohibit students from
    expressing political views on campus, forbid autonomous student organizations, or make
    university administrators answerable to military authorities for enforcement of political
    controls. With the success of the student protest movement in 1998, these controls now
    have little practical effect, and Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia's new minister of education,
    has indicated that they are under review. The report urges that they be abolished
    altogether.<br>
    <br>
    A number of continuing ideological and institutional controls in Indonesia date back to
    the rise of Soeharto to power in 1965-66, when an estimated one-half million people were
    killed in anti-communist pogroms. The report urges repeal of so-called &quot;Special
    Investigation&quot; (Penelitian Khusus or Litsus) regulations which require that new
    teachers and entrants to a range of other strategic professions undergo mandatory
    ideological and political background checks to determine if they are &quot;tainted&quot;
    by political affiliations that they or members of their extended family had over thirty
    years ago. <br>
    <br>
    The report also calls for an end to controls that impede national reexamination of the
    events of the mid-1960s, including censorship of memoirs, literary works, and a wide range
    of foreign and domestic studies. A handful of previously banned books have been allowed to
    circulate by the Habibie government, but hundreds of other works are still banned and
    regulations giving the government broad powers to censor books and other printed materials
    remain in place.<br>
    <br>
    Although the new government has released a number of political prisoners, existing laws
    and long-established institutional practices continue to give authorities the power to
    imprison or censor individuals who express dissenting views. The report calls for repeal
    of laws often used by Soeharto to silence dissidents, including student and faculty
    critics: Presidential Decree 11/1963 (subversion); Article 154 of the Criminal Code
    (spreading hatred toward the government); and Articles 134-137 (insulting the head of
    state). It also urges the Social and Political Affairs Directorate in the Ministry of Home
    Affairs to end the practice of blacklisting government critics from attending seminars and
    appearing in major media, and calls for abolition of research permit procedures that give
    government and military officials effective veto power over proposed academic field
    research. <br>
    <br>
    The recommendations of Human Rights Watch reflect its analysis of seven continuing
    barriers to free inquiry and expression in Indonesia, set forth in separate chapters of
    the report. The report also includes a discussion of academic freedom as a global human
    rights concern, and a long background chapter that both outlines the history of campus
    controls under Soeharto and details the rise of the nationwide student protest movement
    that earlier this year successfully pressured Soeharto to resign.<br>
    <br>
    The historical survey shows the far-reaching impact that crackdowns on the academic
    community have had in limiting the free flow of information and ideas in Indonesia. As Mr.
    Saunders emphasized, however, &quot;the Indonesian example also shows that the academic
    community's principled resistance to authoritarian controls can help open the door to
    democratic reform.&quot;</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
