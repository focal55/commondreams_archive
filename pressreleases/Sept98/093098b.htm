    - September 30 - David Harvey, the founding executive director of AIDS Policy Center for
    Children, Youth &amp;Families, announced today that he will leave his position in February
    1999.<br>
    <br>
    Harvey has served as executive director of AIDS Policy Center since its inception in 1994.
    During that time, AIDS Policy Center has become one of the nation's leading AIDS advocacy
    groups, with over 350 organizational members nationwide. AIDS Policy Center is the only
    national organization devoted to the unique concerns of children,youth, women and families
    affected by HIV/AIDS.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;David has made enormous contributions to people living with HIV and their families,
    and we accepted his resignation with great regret,&quot; said Mildred Williamson,
    president of AIDS Policy Center's Board of Directors and coordinator of the AIDS program
    for children and families at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. &quot;Thanks to David's
    extraordinary leadership and energy, AIDS Policy Center has become a strong national voice
    for children, youth, women, families and people of color affected by HIV/AIDS.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is a great loss for the AIDS community,&quot; commented Sandra Thurman,
    director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy.&quot;David Harvey has worked
    tirelessly to improve the lives of people living with HIV. He is one of the most
    experienced and effective AIDS advocates in Washington, and he will be greatly
    missed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    While at AIDS Policy Center, Harvey served as the elected co-chair of National
    Organizations Responding to AIDS (NORA), a coalition of 175 national public health, civil
    rights, religious and labor organizations. He has spoken at many national and
    international conferences, testified before Congressional committees, authored numerous
    journal articles and book chapters, and is quoted frequently in the national media. Harvey
    began his career in Washington in 1984 as a staff assistant to Rep. Sam Gejdenson
    (D-Conn.), and has worked as an AIDS advocate for the past decade. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;It has been a great joy and privilege to serve the national AIDS community,&quot;
    said Harvey. &quot;I take pride in the many accomplishments of AIDS Policy Center, and I
    have absolute confidence that the Board of Directors and staff will successfully face the
    many challenges that lie ahead.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    AIDS Policy Center's Board of Directors has launched a national search for a successor to
    Harvey. The search committee is chaired by Gloria Maki, deputy director of the New York
    AIDS Institute.<br>
    <br>
