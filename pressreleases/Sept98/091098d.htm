    ANGELES - September 10 - Aiming to guard the public from a global oil company which they
    say is &quot;a dangerous scofflaw corporation,&quot; 30 citizens' organizations and
    individuals today filed a 127-page petition seeking action by the California Attorney
    General to revoke the charter of the Union Oil Company of California (Unocal). Petitions
    were delivered to California Attorney General Dan Lungren's Sacramento office and, in
    simultaneous 11 a.m. press conferences, to his representatives at his Los Angeles and San
    Francisco offices. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Outraged over Unocal's business
    ties with the anti-woman Taliban militia in Afghanistan and the military dictators of
    Burma, as well as over the corporation's record as a &quot;repeat offender&quot; of
    environmental, labor and deceptive practices laws and its &quot;usurpation of political
    power,&quot; petitioners ask that the attorney general call on a court to revoke the
    company's charter, appoint a receiver, and wind up the corporation's affairs &quot;in
    order to fully protect jobs, workers, stockholders, unions, communities, the environment,
    suppliers, customers, government entities, and the public interest.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We're letting the people of California in on a
    well-kept legal secret,&quot; said Robert Benson, professor of law at Loyola Law School,
    Los Angeles, and lead attorney for the National Lawyers Guild's International Law Project
    for Human, Economic and Environmental Defense (HEED) which prepared the petition.
    &quot;The people mistakenly assume that we have to try to control these giant corporate
    repeat offenders one toxic spill at a time, one layoff at a time, one human rights
    violation at a time. But the law has always allowed the attorney general to go to court to
    simply dissolve a corporation for wrongdoing and sell its assets to others who will
    operate in the public interest. California attorneys general haven't often done it because
    they've become soft on corporate crime. Baseball players and convicted individuals in
    California get only three strikes. Why should big corporations get endless strikes? &quot;
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Benson said that the attorney general of New York recently
    asked a court to revoke the charters of two corporations that allegedly put out deceptive
    scientific research for the tobacco industry, and a judge in Alabama has asked his state
    courts to dissolve the tobacco companies themselves. In California, according to Benson,
    in 1976 conservative </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Republican Attorney General Evelle Younger asked a court to
    dissolve a private water company for allegedly delivering impure water to its customers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unocal, the petition alleges on information and belief, was
    principally responsible for the notorious 1969 oil blowout in the Santa Barbara Channel,
    and since then has grievously polluted multiple sites from San Francisco to Los Angeles,
    has been identified as a potentially responsible party at 82 &quot;Superfund&quot; or
    similar toxic sites, has committed hundreds of violations of the Occupational Safety and
    Health Act, treats U.S. workers unethically and unfairly, has usurped political power, has
    undermined U.S. foreign policy, and has engaged in a pattern of illegal deceptions of the
    courts, stockholders and the public. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, the groups allege, Unocal has been complicit
    in &quot;unspeakable&quot; human rights violations perpetrated by foreign governments with
    which it has business ties in Afghanistan and Burma. The company's dealings with the
    Taliban militia in Afghanistan, known for its extremely cruel treatment of women, have
    particularly enraged women's groups. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Katherine Spillar, national coordinator for the Feminist
    Majority Foundation, one of the petitioning groups, denounced Unocal for its business
    dealings with the Taliban to build a gas pipeline which would bring the regime revenue and
    legitimacy. &quot;If Unocal thinks it can do business with a regime that, in effect,
    denies women their right to exist as human beings, then we think Unocal's privilege to
    exist as a corporation must also be denied,&quot; commented Spillar. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other petitioning organizations include the National
    Organization for Women (NOW), Rainforest Action Network, Global Exchange, Earth Island
    Institute, Free Burma Coalition, the Alliance for Democracy, the Program on Corporations,
    Law and Democracy, Action Resource Center, Amazon Watch, Asian/Pacific Gays and Friends,
    Burma Forum of Los Angeles, Democracy Unlimited of Humboldt County (California), No
    Petro-Dollars for SLORC, Project Maje, Project Underground, Surfers' Environmental
    Alliance, and the Transnational Resource and Action Center. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Individual petitioners include feminist attorney Gloria
    Allred, consumer advocate and attorney Harvey Rosenfield, Santa Monica City Councilmember
    Michael Feinstein, and Randall Hayes, president of Rainforest Action Network. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ronnie Dugger, founder of the petitioning group Alliance
    for Democracy, former editor and publisher of the Texas Observer newspaper, and a
    biographer of Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan, helped edit the Unocal petition, and
    noted: &quot;This is an historic event. It is the first broad-based effort of this century
    to use the people's sovereign authority over a corporation chartered by one of our states
    to terminate its privilege to do business. It is a step toward regaining actual democratic
    control over these giant corporations we've created.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The petition credits as its inspiration a 1993 pamphlet by
    Richard Grossman and Frank Adams, &quot;Taking Care of Business: Citizenship and the
    Charter of Incorporation.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Grossman, co-founder of the Program on Corporations, Law
    and Democracy, one of the petitioning groups, said Thursday that the courts have
    &quot;always held that corporations are artificial entities, 'mere creatures of the
    state,' and must be summoned to answer to the people for usurpation's of power and
    violations of the public trust such as those repeatedly committed by the Union Oil Company
    of California.&quot; </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">ADDENDUM 1: THE PETITION'S THESES ABOUT CORPORATIONS</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here, with page references in parentheses, are the
    petition's ten theses concerning democratic power over law-breaking corporations in
    general. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 1: &quot;The courts have consistently held that
    corporations are 'mere creatures of the state,' and as U.S. Supreme Court Justice White
    said in 1978about corporations: 'The state need not permit its own creation to consume
    it.'&quot; (2, and see 19-20) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 2: &quot;Corporations like Unocal claim legal rights
    as 'persons' under the law, yet if they were real persons their many 'strikes' would have
    put them 'out' of social action permanently.&quot; (4) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 3: &quot;It is hardly a radical or drastic notion
    that some corporations should be permanently prevented from doing harm. The state
    permanently revokes the privilege to do business of accountants, doctors, lawyers and
    others licensed by the state--hundreds of them every year.&quot; (4) &quot;Banks can be
    seized by the state and liquidated. Insurance companies may have their certificates of
    authority revoked. All fifty states and the District of Columbia have statutes providing
    for revocation of corporate charters. The statutes codify the English common law of quo
    warranto...meaning by what authority.&quot; (21) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 4: &quot;Why, then, are so few corporate charters
    revoked in California, and relatively few across the nation?..Our attorneys general and
    our governors have been soft on corporate crime...Now it is seldom even mentioned that
    corporate charters are legally revocable.&quot; (5, 8) &quot;Most of us proceed as if the
    state is limited to fighting corporate abuses one pollutant at a time, one layoff at a
    time, one human rights violation at a time. The public is shammed into believing that
    government is trying to govern corporations when in fact the giant recidivist corporations
    have figured out how to make their anti-social acts tolerated by society.&quot; (23, 24) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 5: &quot;..(T)he root of the problem [is] corporate
    power over sovereign, democratic people...The [late 19th Century American] Populists tough
    program to subordinate corporate power to the will of the people was eroded by Progressive
    and New Deal regulatory 'protections' that protected large corporations...&quot; (12) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 6: &quot;Corporations today operate out of control
    as private governments, more powerful than nation-states...The de facto reality is that
    modern day corporations have become entities unto themselves, a privately-owned company
    'can be validly termed a 'private government' whose power is not responsible or
    accountable to anyone.'&quot; (14, 15) &quot;...corporate entities exercise power across
    borders, in ways which supercede state control...powers which have not been given to them
    through a democratic process but which have been grasped through economic dominance.&quot;
    (30) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 7: &quot;...only the full resources of the state
    will be adequate to challenge a corporation of Unocal's wealth and size. If the state were
    to tell petitioners that they may sue Unocal directly themselves...that would be a cynical
    message that the Attorney General, abdicating his responsibility to protect the public,
    will nevertheless allow them to go into the lion's den themselves, armed with
    sticks.&quot; (36) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 8: The California Unfair Competition Act
    &quot;incorporates international law since '(f)rom the earliest days of this republic our
    international obligations have been considered part of controlling common law.' Thus
    violations of international law that take place thousands of miles overseas by California
    corporations are also violations of California law, actionable here. This is not theory,
    but hard California law.&quot; (38) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 9: Even under incorporation statutes
    &quot;liberalized&quot; in the race for the laxest state regulation of corporations,
    &quot;corporate activity must be...'lawful,' ...and...always in accord with the public
    policy of the state...The [latter] limit is inherent in the common law doctrine of
    California that the law may never be construed to authorize violations of public
    policy.&quot; (40) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">THESIS 10: Advanced in the context of Unocal: &quot;The
    State of California, which granted the Union Oil Company of California existence,
    possesses the greatest responsibility to protect the public from the goliath it
    created.&quot; (40-41) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">ADDENDUM 2: SUMMARY OF PETITION'S 10 COUNTS AGAINST UNOCAL</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here is a summary of the petitioners' ten-count &quot;Case
    Against Unocal,&quot; with page numbers in parentheses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>ONE</b>. Ecocide; Environmental Devastation.<br>
    Being in the oil and gas business, Unocal owed the public &quot;a duty of care,&quot;
    which it has failed. &quot;The company's environmental devastation extends from local to
    global and is serious enough to describe as ecocide...[In California] Unocal has
    demonstrated a pattern and practice of polluting the locations where it operates...Unocal
    has proved itself an incorrigible recidivist environmental polluter.&quot; Illustrations
    are given concerning an 18-mile stretch of coastline between San Luis Obispo and Santa
    Barbara County, concerning which Unocal has just agreed to pay $44 million, exclusive of
    the costs of clean-up. Concerning pollution from its refinery in Rodeo, California, the
    company paid $3 million in criminal and civil fines to the county in 1995 and in 1997
    agreed to pay $80 million to settle private lawsuits for 18,000 individuals. Other
    offenses are recited. (42-52) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>TWO</b>. Unfair and Unethical Treatment of Workers.<br>
    Becoming a global company, Unocal has sold off its U.S. refineries and gasoline stations
    to finance expanding oil and gas production overseas, abandoning past and future
    generations of workers and moving into repressive countries &quot;where the company could
    exploit cheap and even slave foreign labor. While this is an increasingly typical story as
    U.S. companies move offshore abetted by free trade agreements and cheered on by extremist
    economic ideologues, it is not an ethical story, nor one that the People of the State of
    California, represented by the Attorney General, must sit cross-legged listening to.&quot;
    This count also reviews the company's hundreds of violations of federal health and safety
    workplace rules. (54-58) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>THREE THROUGH SEVEN</b>: Complicity in Crimes Against
    Humanity </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>THREE</b>. Aiding Oppression of Women.<br>
    &quot;Unocal has initiated business dealings with a repressive rebel military force in
    Afghanistan infamous for gross violations of human rights.&quot; As lead partner, with
    $54.11% interest, in the Centgas consortium for the future construction of a gas pipeline
    from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan and, potentially, India, Unocal opened
    negotiations with the Taliban, &quot;a militia faction of Muslin extremists in a nation at
    civil war.&quot; &quot;At gunpoint, the Taliban have enforced the most oppressive regime
    of gender apartheid known to the world, banning girls from going to school, banning women
    from attending university, prohibiting women from holding jobs, requiring women to be
    accompanied at all times in public by a male member of their immediate families, requiring
    women to be covered from head to toe in a 'burqa' with only a small mesh facial
    openings...requiring windows of homes with women to be darkened...Women cannot be treated
    by male doctors, women are forced to seek care at a primitive women's hospital with
    limited supplies, only a few beds, and no running water. For violation of the Taliban's
    harsh edicts women have been beaten, shot at, publicly flogged, tortured, and even
    killed.&quot; &quot;As a collaborator with the Taliban, Unocal has become an integral
    participant in the ongoing violation of the human rights of Afghanistan's entire female
    population...The Taliban stand to collect $50 million to $100 million a year in transit
    fees if the pipeline is built.&quot; A company denial that it was dealing with the Taliban
    is said by the petitioners not to square with reputable press accounts. In July 1998 the
    company acknowledged that the CentGas consortium deals &quot;with all factions in
    Afghanistan.&quot; In late August after the U.S. dropped missiles on an alleged terrorist
    camp in Afghanistan the company &quot;suspended&quot; all activities concerning the
    proposed pipeline and said it would not go forward on it until the U.S. recognizes a
    government in the country. (60-70, 107, 122) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>FOUR</b>. Aiding Oppression of Homosexuals.<br>
    In Afghanistan, &quot;Taliban policy is to put anyone convicted of homosexual sodomy to
    death by burying them alive under mud walls pushed over them by a bulldozer. Two
    homosexuals were recently executed in this fashion. Three others who were still alive 30
    minutes after a wall was pushed over them were allowed to live, with broken bones.....
    &quot;Doing business with the Taliban unavoidably supports their regime of torture and
    death for homosexuals, just as doing business with Nazi Germany supported the ovens of the
    Holocaust,&quot; the petition states. (71, 72) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>FIVE</b>. Enslavement and Forced Labor.<br>
    Unocal has formed a business enterprise with the illegal military dictatorship of Burma to
    build a natural gas pipeline across a civil war zone in the country. That dictatorship set
    aside election results that went 82% for its opposition in 1990. Unocal's interest in the
    pipeline consortium is 28.16%. The military dictatorship (SLORC) has confiscated land,
    relocated villages, and destroyed rainforest and other habitat for the pipeline; and
    Unocal &quot;has profited from the use of forced and slave labor&quot; by the military
    dictatorship and &quot;knew or should have known and could have reasonably foreseen that
    its military partner would use forced labor to clear the land for the pipeline route,
    build related infrastructure in the area, and provide security for the pipeline.&quot;
    U.S. State Department reports on forced labor in Burma are quoted. Human Rights Watch/Asia
    estimates that since 1992 at least two million people have been forced to work without pay
    on roads, railways, and bridges across Burma. Unocal says there has never been forced
    labor on the pipeline itself and the company would not countenance it. (77-85) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>SIX</b>. Forced Relocations of Burmese Villages and
    Villagers.<br>
    &quot;Unocal has knowingly profited from the large-scale forcible relocation of Burmese
    villages and villagers without compensation,&quot; the petition alleges. (86) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>SEVEN</b>. Killings, Torture and Rape.<br>
    &quot;Unocal's military business partner [in Burma] has committed widespread killings,
    torture, and rapes....Unocal has to have known that it was dealing with a notorious outlaw
    regime condemned worldwide for heinous human rights violations.&quot; U.S. State
    Department and U.N. Commission on Human Rights reports are quoted concerning,
    respectively, credible reports of soldiers &quot;extrajudicial killings and rape&quot; and
    &quot;extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and enforced disappearances, torture,
    abuse of women and children by government agents.&quot; According to the petition,
    &quot;Unocal knew or should have known that SLORC security for the pipeline would lead to
    human rights violations and death.&quot; (90-96) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>EIGHT</b>. Complicity in Gradual Cultural Genocide of
    Tribal and Indigenous Peoples.<br>
    In the case of the Lubicon Cree people of Canada, Unocal has operated the Slave Lake oil
    and gas field since 1981; Slave Lake lies in the Lubicon Cree's traditional lands. In the
    summer of 1994, despite U.N. attempts to protect the Lubicon Cree people from development
    impinging on their lands, Unocal built a $10 million sour gas plant, which smells like
    rotten eggs, a little more than a mile upwind from the boundary of the proposed reserve
    which the Lubicon Cree and the government of Canada had previously agreed upon. &quot;The
    Lubicon Cree believe their traditional economy has been deliberately destroyed by the
    governments of Canada and Alberta as part of a legal strategy. In this context, Unocal is
    complicit as a joint participant...in accomplishing a gradual cultural genocide.&quot;
    (97-101) Concerning principally the Karen and Mon tribes in Burma, &quot;Unocal knew or
    should have known and could have reasonably foreseen that its military partner would
    intensify its civil war against the tribal peoples of the pipeline region.&quot; (102-103)
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>NINE</b>. Usurpation of Political Power.<br>
    Unocal has &quot;usurped&quot; political power &quot;that it cannot, by its corporate
    nature, exercise&quot; and has aggressively undermined democratic processes at home and
    abroad. In Burma and Afghanistan it has taken sides &quot;with brutal human rights
    abusers, giving them legitimacy, defending them publicly, working with them.&quot; In
    Burma, acting in hostile opposition to the democratically elected government, Unocal has
    worked &quot;to subvert the Burmese people's right to self-determination.&quot; Unocal
    &quot;has decided to become a global economic and political force unto itself,&quot;
    &quot;deploys diplomats as if it were the State Department itself,&quot; and &quot;works
    to thwart U.S. foreign policy.&quot; One of Unocal's business partners in Burma, wholly
    owned by the government, is accused of being &quot;the main channel for laundering the
    revenues of heroin&quot; exported from Burma under control of the Burmese army, and in
    Afghanistan, according to the U.S. State Department, the Taliban &quot;claim to forbid
    drug use but they control the opium growing lands and collect a tax from opium
    farmers.&quot; Yet Unocal management sought strenuously to block its stockholders'
    consideration of its business partner's alleged laundering of drug money in Burma.
    (105-113) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>TEN</b>. Deception of the Courts, Shareholders, and the
    Public.<br>
    Unocal &quot;has exhibited a pattern of deceiving the courts, its shareholders, and the
    public about its activities.&quot; In 1996 a federal district judge found that a Unocal
    paralegal, with either the tacit or overt approval of her superiors, altered data,
    withheld information, and gave false responses in verified court documents. Unocal,
    contrary to press reports, told its investors and the public that it was not doing
    business with any party in Afghanistan. Unocal is one of a number of oil companies alleged
    to have defrauded the public out of hundreds of millions of dollars by underpaying oil
    royalties due from leases on public lands. (114-119) </font></td>
