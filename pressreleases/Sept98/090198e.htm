        <td><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 1 - Going For Broke, a study
        released today by Common Cause, reveals that the consumer credit industry has given $61.6
        million in political contributions since 1987. The study comes as the United States Senate
        is poised to act - perhaps as early as this week - on sweeping, creditor-backed bankruptcy
        reform legislation despite criticism from consumer advocates and some bankruptcy experts. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The consumer credit industry - banks, credit card companies,
        consumer finance companies, savings and loans, and credit unions - have given $50.8
        million in political action committee (PAC) contributions to congressional candidates, and
        $10.8 million in soft money contributions to national party committees, according to the
        study. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Congress has a legitimate interest in making changes
        in the bankruptcy law to avoid abuses of the law by wealthy individuals who want to shirk
        their debt,&quot; Common Cause President Ann McBride said. &quot;But that congressional
        review has been distorted by millions of dollars of campaign contributions. In fact, while
        Congress is rushing to pass new bankruptcy legislation, it is ignoring warnings of experts
        and consumer activists who argue that ordinary Americans are not being adequately
        considered in this creditor-driven push for sweeping legislation.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Common Cause study found that since 1987, the consumer
        credit industry has given, on average, $100,000 in PAC contributions to current Members of
        the Senate, and $47,724 to current Members of the House. Of all current House and Senate
        Members, 97 percent took PAC contributions from banking and consumer credit interests
        during the period covered by the study. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Included in the study is a Member-by-Member breakdown of
        the consumer credit industry's PAC contributions, as well as a list of the largest
        contributors within the industry, and lists of the top recipients in the House and Senate.
