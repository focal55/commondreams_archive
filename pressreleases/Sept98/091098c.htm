    - September 10 - A planned $28.5 billion bailout of California&#146;s electric utility
    industry is not only unfair to consumers, it could prove a dramatic setback to
    environmental gains of the past several decades and have a far-reaching impact on the
    development of a sustainable, non-polluting energy future, according to a new report from
    Public Citizen&#146;s <a href="http://www.citizen.org/CMEP/">Critical Mass Energy Project.</a></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Voters have an opportunity on Nov. 3 to reverse the most unfair and
    potentially damaging aspect of the bailout, which is part of a utility deregulation bill
    passed by the California Legislature. Proposition 9 would eliminate an approximately $12
    billion ratepayer bailout of investor-owned utilities for bad investments in unprofitable
    nuclear plants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the report,<i> <b><a href="http://www.citizen.org/press/prop9.htm">Proposition 9: A Greenlight for Sustainable
    Energy in California</a>, </b></i>points out, by forcing ratepayers to pay off the utility
    companies&#146; most expensive mistakes, the bailout renders conservation efforts and
    renewable energy resources uncompetitive by providing &quot;free capital&quot; to
    utilities to increase their market share and stifle competition and innovation that could
    result in cleaner, cheaper energy over the long-term.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Under the California &#145;deregulation&#146; scheme,
    billions of dollars of ratepayer money has been committed not to a sustainable energy
    future but to the outright bailout of uneconomic nuclear and fossil-fuel plants owned by
    investors, plants that ratepayers have already paid billions of dollars to maintain,&quot;
    said a joint statement by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and environmentalist David Brower.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For consumers, the bailout will likely translate into
    price-gouging, cost-shifting from large industrial power users to residential and
    small-business customers and red-lining of low-income communities, the report says. But
    the environmental impacts are no less threatening.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bailouts will allow utilities to increase their market
    power by providing huge war chests of cash -- money readily available to purchase
    competitors, buy dams and dirty coal plants, subsidize the operation of nuclear plants,
    build polluting power plants in developing countries and increase market domination
    generally.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The nuclear utilities and their allies would like you
    to believe that Proposition 9 is not an environmental issue, but it is our assessment that
    providing the nuclear utilities with free capital -- to use the words of one vice
    president at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric -- is bad for the environment,&quot; said
    Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy Project.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The bailout subsidizes existing nuclear plants and
    allows them to continue operating,&quot; Hauter said. &quot;And it provides the resources
    for the big three utilities to purchase dirty power plants in the United States and the
    developing world.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As one of the first states to deregulate the utility
    industry, the outcome in California will go a long way toward shaping the debate in other
    states as the industry is restructured over the coming years. Legislators in other states
    will certainly consider a California voter backlash before granting similar bailouts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;An infusion of cash from the bailout of utilities
    across the country will leave us with even bigger unaccountable, unregulated monopolies
    with the potential to wreak havoc on the environment,&quot; Hauter said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Environmentalists and consumers are gearing up to send a
    clear message to California lawmakers, policy-makers and the state&#146;s utilities that
    the people demand a better and more creative vision for their energy future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Unless we recognize this threat and act to abate it,
    the values of environmental protection, soft energy in the form of renewable energy and
    conservation will soon be trammeled by a pseudo-market driven strategy that treats the
    planet as simply a collection of resources, the price of which is determined by the short
    term laws of supply and demand in a global market,&quot; said Nader and Brower.</font></p>
