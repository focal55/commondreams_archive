    Energy Communication Council, the International Mass Retail Association, Public Citizen,
    the United Homeowners Association and Citizens for a Sound Economy in releasing <a href="http://www.safeenergy.org/ratepayer.htm">&quot;The Great Ratepayer Robbery: How
    Utilities are Making Out Like Bandits at the Dawn of Deregulation,&quot;</a> which was
    written by the Safe Energy Communication Council (SECC). </font></tt><tt><p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're outraged that consumers in 11 states could pay an extra $950
    on average on their electric bills because of poor investments made by their local
    utilities. Ratepayers are being robbed to reward risky investments in polluting power
    plants while utility executives are laughing all the way to the bank. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As states across the country are restructuring their
    electricity markets, ostensibly to provide competition among electricity providers,
    utilities are asking for a ratepayer-funded bailout of their uneconomic investments. The
    PIRGs and other consumer and environmental groups in several states have fought back
    against these request for &quot;stranded cost&quot; recovery, charging that these bailouts
    are unfair to consumers and will hurt efforts to shift towards clean energy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This report shows that, so far the price of utility
    deregulation has been too high. Consumers are paying through the nose and utilities are
    getting a subsidy for their aging, dangerous nuclear power plants. Meanwhile, most
    deregulation bills lack clean energy provisions and fail to clean up the dirtiest fossil
    energy plants. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This report examines the major issues surrounding the
    bailout of utilities' failed investments for 11 states (California, New York, Illinois,
    Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas, New Hampshire and Montana)
    across the country. Key findings of the report include: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. The total cost for these 11 states may be as high as
    $112 billion. California utilities had asked for $28.5 billion, making it the number one
    state for estimated stranded costs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Residential consumers in 11 states will pay an average
    of $950 more on their electric bills while commercial consumers will pay an average of
    $6,500 more on their electric bills. SECC estimates that the average residential ratepayer
    in New Hampshire will pay an astounding $1,963, the highest of the 11 states studied,
    while the average commercial consumer in Illinois will pay an extra $12,314 the highest
    out of the 11 states for commercial consumers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Nuclear power, once touted as &quot;too cheap to
    meter&quot; now accounts for the majority of the investments regarded as
    &quot;stranded&quot; by the utilities. Commonwealth Edison in Illinois has asked for $12.6
    billion, the highest nuclear &quot;stranded costs&quot; of the utilities studied. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Based on projected analyses and initial experience in
    California, providing ratepayer-funded subsidies will disrupt market mechanisms being
    introduced through deregulation, leading to serious economic effects. The report also
    investigates wildly differing estimates of stranded costs, and analyzes legal issues. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">PIRGs in eleven states are releasing this report to expose
    the outrageous ripoffs being perpetrated around the country. We should not reward
    utilities for poisoning our air, land and water. We call on Congress to stop the bailout
    and make the polluters pay for their poor decisions. We call on voters in Massachusetts
    and California to repeal the bailout in these states and protect their pocketbooks and the
    environment. We should not be denied a clean, safe affordable energy future because of
    these outrageous bailouts.&quot; </font></p>
