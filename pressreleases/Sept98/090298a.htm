        <td>SACRAMENTO - September 2 - Monday evening the California Legislature approved their
        portion of the funding needed to complete the Headwaters Agreement of 1996. EPIC has
        opposed this agreement since that time because it includes a Habitat Conservation Plan
        (HCP) - a permit to kill endangered species and destroy their habitat.&nbsp; With the
        approval of the State money, the largest remaining hurdle is the approval of the HCP.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pacific Lumber HCP has been in development
        since the original September 1996 agreement, and has been exceedingly controversial.
        Negotiated entirely behind closed doors and under tremendous political pressure, the HCP
        has fulfilled EPIC's expectation that it is nothing more than a license to kill endangered
        species.&nbsp; From the company's perspective, the sole purpose of the HCP is to allow
        them to cut trees that would otherwise be protected because they are habitat for a species
        on the brink of extinction.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after the new protections mandated by the
        California Legislature, the PL HCP allows the following:<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction of roughly 8,000 acres of ancient
        redwoods that are potentially marbled murrelet habitat.<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction of 3-4,000 acres of ancient Douglas fir
        on the steep, unstable slopes of the Mattole Valley.<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversion of the majority of Pacific Lumber's
        200,000 acres to &quot;even-aged&quot; forests (i.e., clearcut) for at least the 50 year
        life of the plan.&nbsp; Only the small buffers along watercourses will be allowed to
        mature beyond 40-60 years.<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radically increased herbicide use in conjunction
        with the rampant clearcutting.<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inadequate protection for areas at high risk of
        landsliding.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After spending two years watching the HCP
        process, and the past 5 days in Sacramento, EPIC staffer Kevin Bundy observed &quot;This
        is why endangered species are in so much trouble.&nbsp; The decisions about their future
        are being made by politicians and not scientists.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this deal, Pacific Lumber gets paid up to
        $480 million for roughly 9,500 of forest, only half of it old-growth.&nbsp; In most HCPs,
        landowners are expected to set aside some portion of their land as mitigation for the
        destruction that they are causing on other portions of their land.&nbsp; In this case,
        Pacific Lumber is being paid for its mitigations, a dangerous precedent. &nbsp;
        &quot;Maxxam bought Pacific Lumber in 1986 for about $850 million, and has extracted over
        $1.5 billion from the forest since then.&nbsp; Now they've sold less than 10,000 acres
        that were already protected under the Endangered Species Act for $480 million bucks.&nbsp;
        These guys have got to be some of the best shysters in America&quot; said Paul Mason of
        EPIC.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final vote in the Senate was 28-5, with
        only Tom Hayden speaking against the bill.&nbsp; The bill barely squeaked by in the
        Assembly, with a final vote of 54-12.<p align="center">###</td>
