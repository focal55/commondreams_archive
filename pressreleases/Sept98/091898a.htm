    - September 18 - The following is a statement by Gloria Feldt, President, Planned
    Parenthood Federation of America: <br>
    <br>
    Today, 36 members of the U.S. Senate showed true courage by voting to sustain the
    President's veto of an abortion ban that posed a serious threat to women's health. Despite
    intense election-year pressure, these Senators once again thwarted the drive by
    anti-choice lawmakers to pass H.R. 1122 -- a bill with the power to outlaw most safe
    methods of abortion throughout pregnancy. <br>
    <br>
    This attempted national abortion ban has shown us politics at its worst. Opponents of a
    woman's right to choose hoped to score political points by forcing vote after vote on this
    bill. Today marks the eighth time since 1995 that Senators had to cast their votes on this
    far-reaching legislation. The vote was scheduled -- cynically -- to coincide with the
    election cycle. This may be politics-as-usual on Capitol Hill, but it shouldn't be ...
    particularly when women's health is at stake. <br>
    <br>
    If the Senate had not upheld President Clinton's veto of this abortion ban, Americans
    would be subjected to a dangerous intrusion of government into the doctor-patient
    relationship. Its failure to make any exception to preserve a woman's health stands as a
    stark reminder that anti-choice sponsors would sacrifice a woman's well being to satisfy
    their political agenda. <br>
    <br>
    That's why, in state after state, Planned Parenthood and its allies have gone to court to
    challenge state laws similar to the bill that has now been successfully vetoed. In 18 of
    the 20 states where lawsuits have been filed, the abortion bans have been blocked. The
    chambers of justice have allowed reality to rise above the rhetoric that has dominated the
    political debate. Judges have taken the time to listen carefully to medical experts and
    legal authorities. And, with few exceptions, they have consistently found that these bans
    are unconstitutional. <br>
    <br>
    Only a handful of days remain in the 1998 congressional session. With time so scarce, we
    should turn our attention to what we can all agree upon -- real solutions to the problems
    of unintended pregnancy. We challenge members of Congress to act now to ensure that family
    planning programs that are proven to help reduce the need for abortion -- both here and
    abroad -- do not fall victim to political posturing. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
