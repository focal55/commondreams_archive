    Two-Fisted Giving that End-Runs Campaign Contribution Limits</font></strong></td>

    - September 15 - Many members of Congress are using their &quot;leadership PACs&quot; to
    collect contributions from political action committees that also give to their campaigns,
    Capital Eye, the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics' newsletter, reports today.<br>
    <br>
    The pattern of double giving, identified by Capital Eye's computer-assisted analysis of
    PAC donations,&nbsp; effectively circumvents the legal limits on contributions to
    congressional candidates.<br>
    <br>
    For example, Capital Eye found that: Rep. John A. Boehner's (R-Ohio) leadership PAC has
    taken $204,914 so far this election cycle from PACs that also gave to his campaign. Sen.
    Don Nickles' (R-Okla.) leadership PAC has taken&nbsp; $196,750 from PACs that also gave to
    his campaign. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt's (D-Mo.) leadership PAC has taken
    $192,500 from leadership PACs that also gave to his campaign. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
    (R-Ga.) has taken $167,884 from leadership PACs that also gave to his campaign.<br>
    <br>
    Leadership PACs are political action committees tied to members of Congress or other
    federal politicians but independent of their campaign committees. Leadership PACs are
    generally set up so the elected officials can help the campaigns of candidates who share a
    party affiliation or philosophical point of view, and later reap the political benefits
    from. <br>
    <br>
    It's illegal for leadership PACs to spend money directly on the sponsoring politician's
    campaign, but they can pay for overhead and general political costs - such as consulting
    and polling - that enhance the sponsor's political fortunes. <br>
    <br>
    For example, Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.), a likely presidential contender in 2000, raised
    more than $1 million through his leadership PAC during the first six months of 1998 but
    contributed just $1,000 to other federal candidates. Much of the more than $815,000 the
    PAC spent during that period went toward direct mail fund-raising - an effort that <br>
    builds a nationwide list of potential donors and supporters for a presidential run.<br>
    <br>
    Leadership PACs give contributors a vehicle for double giving to favored candidates. So, a
    PAC that has already given the maximum $5,000 per election to a congressional candidate
    can then give $5,000 per year to the candidate's leadership PAC. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Basically, the reason anyone gives to leadership PACs is to give twice,&quot;
    BellSouth Telecommunications spokesman Bill McCloskey told Capital Eye. &quot;Giving to a
    member's campaign and to their leadership PAC allows us to stretch our reach.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Capital Eye article shows that many double givers steered their contributions to
    lawmakers serving on committees that affect their interests. <br>
    <br>
    For example, telecommunication industry PACs gave $20,000 to the campaign and $21,500 to
    the leadership PAC of House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley (R-Va.); $19,500 to
    the campaign and $11,500 to the leadership PAC of House Telecommunications Subcommittee
    Chairman W.J. &quot;Billy&quot; Tauzin (R-La.); and $14,533 to the campaign and $38,800 to
    the leadership PAC of the subcommittee Vice Chairman Michael Oxley (R-Ohio).<br>
    <br>
    The analysis was based on data downloaded from the Federal Election Commission on July 1.
    The Center identified the cases where a PAC gave both to a member of Congress and the
    lawmaker's leadership PAC during the 1997-98 election cycle.<br>
