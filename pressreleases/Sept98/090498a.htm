    - September 4 - As U.S. schoolchildren return to school after a year of unprecedented
    school-based violence, their home states have again received grades for their efforts to
    protect kids from gun violence and gun accidents, according to Handgun Control, Inc.
    (HCI). Chaired by Sarah Brady, HCI is the nation&#146;s leading advocate for responsible
    and law-abiding gun use and ownership, and its annual report card rates each of the fifty
    states based on five laws essential to protecting children and teenagers from gun
    violence. <br>
    <br>
    Each state was carefully rated for the existence of five types of legislation that protect
    children from guns, and also for the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of that
    legislation. The five types of legislation include:<br>
    <br>
    1) Carrying Concealed Weapons (CCW) law -- whether or not individuals are allowed to carry
    loaded concealed guns, and if so, what training is required of them;<br>
    <br>
    2) Juvenile Handgun Possession law -- whether or not it is illegal for an individual under
    the age of 18 to own a handgun;<br>
    <br>
    3) Juvenile Handgun Sale/Transfer Prohibition law -- whether or not it is illegal to sell
    a handgun to someone under 18;<br>
    <br>
    4) Child Access Prevention law -- whether or not adults are required to store their
    firearms responsibly and out of the reach of children, and are penalized for leaving guns
    accessible to children;<br>
    <br>
    5) &quot;Local Rights&quot; law, or &quot;Preemption&quot; -- whether the state has made
    it illegal for its cities to enact stricter gun control laws than exist in the state in
    general. For example, in 1995 the Georgia General Assembly pre-empted the city of
    Atlanta&#146;s attempts to more strictly regulate firearms, despite the fact that Atlanta
    led the nation in violent crime that year. Preemption has been a favorite legislative tool
    of the gun lobby.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, states were awarded &quot;extra credit&quot; or demerits on other issues,
    ranging from an initiation of a firearms injury surveillance program to a new law that
    permits the carrying of guns in churches. Twelve states received higher grades in 1998
    than in 1997, demonstrating some progress towards protecting children from firearms.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;After a school year dramatized by awful scenes of children shooting their
    classmates, we need to redouble our efforts to prevent children&#146;s access to
    guns,&quot; said Sarah Brady, chair of Handgun Control, Inc. &quot;At the time that our
    children are heading back to school, states should be doing everything they can to make
    sure that this is not only a productive school year for them -- but a safe one as well.
    Ten thousand times a year, children fire a handgun, and almost 900 Americans die as a
    result. States need to provide safety precautions that will help protect our kids from
    handgun violence.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    On the federal level, Handgun Control, Inc., is now focusing on Representative Carolyn
    McCarthy&#146;s recently-introduced &quot;Children&#146;s Gun Violence Prevention Act of
    1998.&quot; The bill, a comprehensive attempt to protect children from gun violence and
    accidents, includes a national child access prevention law, but also requires gun
    manufacturers to make progress in manufacturing and selling childproof guns.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I am meeting too many mothers of children who died needlessly from gunfire,&quot;
    Mrs. Brady said. &quot;Whether the shooter is a disturbed classmate with a grudge, or a
    sibling too young even to understand that the gun that he found killed his brother or
    sister, these insane tragedies must stop. Our state legislatures must recognize that the
    most important right is our children&#146;s right to safe and secure lives both at home
    and in the schoolroom.&quot;</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"># # #</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah Brady, is the
    nation&#146;s largest citizens&#146; gun control lobbying organization. Based in
    Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun control laws, but
    does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members
    nationwide and works with local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable
    gun control laws.<br>
