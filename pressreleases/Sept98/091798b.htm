    - September 17 - As the nation considers the future of the Clinton presidency, some legal
    scholars and policy analysts are putting the Starr report in a broader context of
    governmental wrongdoing. Among those available for comment:<br>
    <br>
    FRANCIS BOYLE, <a href="mailto:fboyle@law.uiuc.edu">fboyle@law.uiuc.edu</a><br>
    Professor of Law at the University of Illinois College of Law, Boyle said: &quot;The
    impeachment clause is meant to deal with crimes against the state, subverting the
    Republic. Starr has not yet presented evidence of such a threat to the Republic. This is
    not to say that there is no reason to impeach Clinton. There are grounds for impeachment
    -- for example, the illegal bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan, which violated both
    domestic and international law, including the U.S. Constitution.&quot; Boyle added:
    &quot;Our system of government was in jeopardy in the Reagan Iran-Contra scandal.&quot;
    The White House had &quot;basically set up an underground government. But no one really
    made an effort to impeach Reagan over that -- though documents show that Reagan and his
    people were concerned about impeachment.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    PETER KORNBLUH, <a href="mailto:pkorn@gwu.edu">pkorn@gwu.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive">http://www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive</a><br>
    Kornbluh is a Senior Analyst at the National Security Archive, a public-interest foreign
    policy documentation center and the leading repository of information on the Iran-Contra
    scandal. &quot;Iran-Contra was really about high crimes and misdemeanors of a
    constitutional nature, while this is about personal lives,&quot; said Kornbluh. &quot;The
    Iran-Contra investigation was done by the book. Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel
    for Iran-Contra, showed each portion of the report dealing with each individual to that
    person and they had the opportunity to respond; their response was included in the report
    itself. Several went to court trying to block the report from coming out. The press
    coverage of the Walsh report, which had much more substance, was minimal. Recall that Bush
    gave pardons to Caspar Weinberger and others involved in Iran-Contra just as he was
    leaving office. Some people are asking: `What do you tell your children about what Clinton
    is accused of?' Well, what do you tell them about My Lai, about the U.S.-backed coup in
    Chile, about the massacres in El Salvador?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    JULES LOBEL, <a href="mailto:jll4@pitt.edu">jll4@pitt.edu</a><br>
    A Professor of Constitutional and International Law at the University of Pittsburgh who
    has litigated cases involving government misconduct for the Center for Constitutional
    Rights, Lobel said: &quot;What Clinton is being charged with by Starr is not impeachable.
    We have to look at the larger problem of government lying, from Reagan to Bush to Clinton.
    We have gotten used to the government lying to and disinforming us. Most recently, they
    lied on the Sudan bombing. They said they had compelling evidence that did not pan out.
    The larger problem is government morality in how it treats the people. For example, what
    are the moral implications of cutting off welfare?&quot;</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
