    - September 23 - The Council for a Livable World Education Fund today charged that while
    politicians&nbsp; are using anecdotal evidence of readiness problems as a primary pretext
    for increasing Pentagon spending, in reality they are seeking additional pork to pump into
    their districts and states.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Most of the major proponents of new military spending, charged the Council, enter the
    effort with dirty hands: Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Speaker Newt Gingrich
    (R-GA), House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-LA), Senate
    Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK) and ranking Appropriations Committee
    member Daniel Inouye (D-HI). All have been vigorously snaring many millions (and sometimes
    billions) of dollars unrequested by the Pentagon to benefit their home states and
    districts. <br>
    <br>
    Members of Congress from both parties are proposing to add billions to the $271 billion
    military budget before Congress adjourns in October.&nbsp; At the same time, the Joint
    Chiefs of Staff are reportedly lobbying the Clinton Administration to increase next year's
    budget request by up to $15 billion,and $50 -&nbsp; $75 billion over five years.<br>
    <br>
    Republican leaders are orchestrating a series of hearings on readiness before
    congressional adjournment, including two before the Senate Armed Services Committee and
    one before the House National Security Committee. <br>
    <br>
    John Isaacs, author of the report, pointed out that Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has listed $5
    billion in unwanted pork projects in this year's military appropriations bills, $4 billion
    in the Defense Appropriations bill and another $1 billion in the military construction
    bill. <br>
    <br>
    The report quotes McCain, who advocates higher military spending, conceding: &nbsp;
    &quot;So why do we still have these serious and growing deficiencies in readiness, pay,
    and modernization? Because the practice of Congress has tragically been to mis-use
    billions of these scarce defense dollars to add unrequested programs and building projects
    in the defense budget.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The report cited two items recently included in the Pentagon authorization conference
    report:&nbsp; $400 million for six unrequested C-130 cargo planes, made near Speaker
    Gingrich's district, and an&nbsp; unrequested LHD amphibious assault ship built in
    Pascalgoula, Mississippi, promoted by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott that will cost
    $1.5 billion.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"># # #</font></p>

    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">MILITARY READINESS SHORTFALLS: <br>
    CONGRESS MAJOR PART OF THE PROBLEM</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Members of Congress from both parties are proposing to add billions to the $271 billion
    military budget before Congress adjourns in October.&nbsp; At the same time, the Joint
    Chiefs of Staff are reportedly lobbying the Clinton Administration to increase next year's
    budget request by up to $15 billion, and $50 -&nbsp; $75 billion over five years.<br>
    <br>
    The politicians, military leaders and defense contractors -- the military-industrial
    complex -- are using as the primary pretext for increased funds anecdotal evidence of
    readiness problems and the cost of overseas troops deployments.&nbsp; Republican leaders
    are orchestrating a series of hearings on readiness before congressional adjournment. <br>
    <br>
    However, the politicians, while crying readiness, are in reality seeking additional pork
    to pump into their districts and states.&nbsp; Most of the major proponents of new
    military spending enter the effort with dirty hands: Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
    (R-MS), Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob &nbsp;
    Livingston (R-LA), Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK) and ranking
    Appropriations Committee member Daniel Inouye (D-HI).&nbsp; All have been vigorously
    snaring many millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars unrequested by the Pentagon to
    benefit their home states and districts. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">===================================<br>
    Readiness shortfalls<br>
    ===================================</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To be sure, there is increasing anecdotal evidence of
    readiness problems in the military:&nbsp; shortages of spare parts, weapons hard to
    maintain, difficulty in retaining pilots and other key personnel, and a declining quality
    of life.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    However, these readiness questions are not the function of a low military budget. &nbsp;
    Recently, the General in charge of all Army stateside troops on active duty warned of
    declining preparedness of his troops.&nbsp; Yet his August 20 memo listed shortfalls
    totaling only a few hundreds of millions of dollars.&nbsp; His wish list included $49
    million for sewer and utility systems, $59 million for barracks repairs and $10.1 for food
    services and dining facility operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Surely, a few hundred millions dollars can be found in other parts of the budget. &nbsp;
    According to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Congress is set to approve $5 billion in unwanted
    pork in this year's appropriations bills.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">===================================<br>
    Congress major part of the problem<br>
    ===================================</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Congress has contributed to the military's woes, both by
    squandering billions on pork projects aimed at funneling money to their districts and
    states and by refusing to close unneeded and obsolete military bases.<br>
    <br>
    As the fiscal year 1999 military bills have worked their way through Congress this year,
    Congress has already larded the bills with special projects that, according to anti-porker
    Senator John McCain, &quot;represent a serious hemorrhage of scarce defense dollars to low
    priority programs at the expense of vital readiness and modernization programs.&quot;
    &nbsp; (McCain statement on his pork web page).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    McCain estimates that the Senate version of the fiscal 1999 defense appropriations bill
    contains $4 billion in special interest projects that he labels pork.&nbsp; He estimates
    that the separate military construction appropriations conference report contains another
    $1 billion.<br>
    <br>
    This $5 billion in total pork would fund an awful lot of spare parts.<br>
    <br>
    McCain is an advocate of higher military spending, but he cannot resist pointing to
    Congress' role in the problem in a June 25, 1998 Senate floor statement:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So why do we still have these serious and growing deficiencies in readiness, pay,
    and modernization? Because the practice of Congress has tragically been to mis-use
    billions of these scarce defense dollars to add unrequested programs and building projects
    in the defense budget.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">===================================<br>
    Two of the most egregious examples of pork:<br>
    ===================================</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Pentagon authorization conference report this year
        includes $400 million for six unrequested C-130 cargo planes, a plane made in Marietta,
        Georgia, and championed by Speaker Newt Gingrich.&nbsp; The latest version, the C-130J
        model, costs about $50 million each and has been criticized by the Senate Armed Services
        Committee for cost overruns ($900 million to develop rather than the $350 million
        originally estimated) and for being more than two years behind schedule.&nbsp; Congress
        further exacerbates readiness problems by failing to add sufficient funds for C-130 spare
        parts and support equipment. <br>
        <br>
        Said McCain about the C-130's: &quot;The annual addition to the defense budget of the
        C-130-J&nbsp; -- and we are buying enough of them to house the homeless in brand-new
        fuselages -- is fiscally irresponsible in the extreme.&quot; (June 25, 1998 Senate floor
        speech)<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Pentagon authorization bill also includes an unrequested
        LHD amphibious assault ship built in Pascalgoula, Mississippi, promoted by Senate Majority
        Leader Trent Lott that will cost $1.5 billion.<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the Senate considered the annual Pentagon
    authorization bill on June 25, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) managed to scrape up $200 million
    at the last minute for 22 military construction projects, taking from a supposedly
    underfunded military budget.&nbsp; Sen. McCain could find only one common denominator in
    the list of projects: 90% were in the states and districts of members of the
    Appropriations Committee.&nbsp; Said McCain at the time:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No objective observer can view this list as in any way addressing first the
    requirements of the military and much needed improvements in the military, much less the
    military construction projects that are needed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As previously noted, the Chairmen of the relevant authorization and appropriations
    committees are some of the most notorious porkers.&nbsp; Senator Inouye brags that he
    added 31 additional projects costing $258 million to the Pentagon appropriations bill,
    including $28 million for a Honolulu medical center and $1 million to study brown snakes.
    &nbsp; Senator Stevens ensures that Alaska does not lack for funds either.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, Secretary of Defense William Cohen has been pleading for the past two years
    for two more rounds of base closings.&nbsp; While the size of U.S. military forces is down
    36 percent, the U.S. has reduced infrastructure by only 21 percent.&nbsp; Cohen argues
    that previous rounds of base closures will have produced a net savings of $25 billion by
    2003 and will save about $3 billion annually after that. While base closings will not
    solve immediate problems, they will help in the future.&nbsp; But Congress is more
    interested in preserving local jobs than helping to solve any readiness problems.</font><br>
