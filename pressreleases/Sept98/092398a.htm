    - September 23 - Many critics of President Clinton contend that his record of deception
    has uniquely disgraced the office of the presidency. But historian Howard Zinn, the author
    of the best-selling &quot;A People's History of the United States,&quot; says: &quot;There
    is a long history of presidents who have lied to us and deceived us, about governmental
    actions that led to the deaths of thousands, even millions of people.&quot; Here are a few
    of the examples cited by Zinn:<br>
    <br>
    </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">President Truman &quot;described Hiroshima -- just
        devastated by a U.S.-dropped atomic bomb -- as `an important Japanese army base.' More
        than 100,000 civilians -- men, women and children -- in a city of 350,000 died there.
        Truman lied about our war in Korea. He said that we were fighting for democracy, but we
        were protecting South Korea -- a military dictatorship. More than 50,000 Americans died.
        And perhaps 2 million Koreans.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">President Eisenhower &quot;lied about our spy flights over
        the Soviet Union, even after one flier on such a mission was shot down. He deceived the
        nation and the world about the U.S. involvement in the 1954 coup that overthrew a
        democratic government in Guatemala. That coup put in place a succession of military juntas
        that then took tens of thousands of lives.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">President Kennedy &quot;lied to the nation about U.S.
        involvement in the fatal 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, telling a press conference: `I
        can assure you that the United States has no intention of using force to overthrow the
        Castro regime.'&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon &quot;all lied to the
        nation about what was happening in Vietnam. Johnson and Nixon both lied when they claimed
        only military targets were bombed in the war. And Nixon kept secret from the nation the
        bombing of Cambodia.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">President Reagan &quot;lied to the nation about his covert
        and illegal support of the contras in Nicaragua during the 1980s. He lied about the
        importance of Grenada in order to justify the 1983 American invasion of that little
        island.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">President Bush &quot;lied about the reasons for invading
        Panama in 1989, saying it was to stop the drug trade; in fact, the drug trade has
        flourished [since then]. And he deceived the nation about his real interest in the Persian
        Gulf.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And what of Clinton's deceptions -- not about sexual
    activities -- but about matters of life and death? Politicians and journalists who are
    indignant that he lied about sex with `that woman' were silent when he deceived the nation
    about the need to bomb a `nerve gas plant' in the Sudan. His administration could not
    produce convincing evidence that the plant was anything but what the Sudanese government
    said it was -- a plant that produced medicines.&quot;</font></p>
