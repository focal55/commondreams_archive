    - September 9 - In a report released today, Human Rights Watch charges that the U.S.
    Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is now holding more than half of its
    detainees in jails where they are subjected to punitive treatment and may be mixed with
    criminal inmates. <br>
    <br>
    With its own detention facilities overwhelmed, the INS is placing its administrative
    detainees in jails, even though they are not serving criminal sentences. Those detained
    include asylum seekers, undocumented individuals picked up by the INS on the street or
    during workplace raids, and individuals with previous convictions who are now awaiting
    deportation. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The INS is shipping immigrants off to local jails where they don't belong,&quot;
    said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;This practice violates
    international standards, and it must stop.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The 84-page report, Locked Away: Immigration Detainees in Local Jails in the United
    States, reflects research conducted over an eighteen-month period, including visits to
    fourteen jails in seven states and interviews with more than 200 INS detainees. Human
    Rights Watch has also received hundreds of letters and scores of telephone calls from
    detainees describing poor conditions and mistreatment in jails around the country. The
    seven states visited are: Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, and
    Virginia. <br>
    <br>
    Detainees report problems ranging from bad or insufficient food to more dramatic charges,
    such as the July 1998 incident in which guards at the Jackson County Correctional Facility
    in Florida allegedly used electrified batons and shields to shock detainees. Among other
    abuses identified in the report are: the denial of appropriate medical care; frequent,
    unexplained transfers to other jails; lack of outdoor exercise; correctional officers
    without language or other skills necessary to deal with an INS detainee population;
    excessive or inappropriate discipline; commingling with accused or criminal inmates, and
    isolation from family and friends through restrictive telephone, correspondence, and
    visitation policies. Immigration detainees, whether held in INS detention facilities or in
    local jails, have a right to legal counsel, yet holding them in jails makes it more
    difficult for them to obtain legal assistance. &quot;The INS has abdicated responsibility
    for people under its care,&quot; said Roth.<br>
    <br>
    At an average cost of $58 per day per detainee, the INS spends nearly a half-million
    dollars each day to house its detainees in local jails. This arrangement provides a source
    of profit for county governments; in some, county debts have been paid and some taxes
    eliminated due to revenue from holding immigrants in local jails.<br>
    <br>
    Roth noted that immigration detainees who cannot be deported, because neither their own
    country nor any third country will accept them, are effectively serving an open-ended
    criminal sentence. Immigrants from countries such as Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Iraq,
    and Iran may be held for years without resolution of their cases; Human Rights Watch
    interviewed several detainees who had been held for three years or longer and had no idea
    when, or if, they would be released or deported.<br>
    <br>
    Asylum seekers are protected by international refugee law and deserve special treatment.
    They are usually victims fleeing abusive governments, but under the care of the INS, they
    face a new kind of abuse. Because the INS's detention records do not indicate which
    detainees are asylum seekers, they are simply mixed with other INS detainees and local
    jail populations. &quot;In most cases, the INS should not be detaining these people at
    all, much less in jails,&quot; said Roth. &quot;But they should certainly never be held in
    remote facilities, where they can't get access to legal counsel or psychological
    counseling services.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Among the report's recommendations:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Detention facilities used by the INS should reflect the
        non-accused, non-criminal status of all INS detainees. Therefore, the INS should not house
        its detainees in local jails, prisons, or any other facilities intended to hold criminal
        populations.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Asylum seekers, as a general rule, should not be detained.
        The right to seek and enjoy asylum is a basic human right; individuals must never be
        punished for seeking asylum in the United States.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the shortage of detention space readily available to
        the INS and the tremendous human and financial costs of contracting with local jails,
        non-custodial alternatives to detention should be explored before any decision to detain
        an individual is final.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The INS must implement detention standards immediately and
        must require that any jail with which it contracts meets the treatment and condition
        requirements. The standards should be promulgated as federal regulations.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All decisions to detain immigrants should be automatically
        and promptly referred for review to a judicial or other competent authority.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division should
        investigate complaints of poor treatment and conditions of confinement of INS detainees in
        local jails.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should
        continue to revise and strengthen its Guidelines on the Detention of Asylum Seekers.<br>
        </font></li>
