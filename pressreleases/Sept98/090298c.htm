    - September 2 - Leaders of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) expressed dismay at
    the omissions and limitations of the report on thyroid cancer and nuclear weapons tests
    issued yesterday by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council.<br>
    <br>
    PSR called for a far more explicit acknowledgment of the government's culpability in
    causing the estimated tens of thousands of thyroid cancers produced by fallout from
    nuclear weapons testing. PSR also urged an aggressive research effort to resolve the
    problems of diagnosis and decision-making that now limit the accuracy of large-scale
    screening programs for thyroid cancers.<br>
    <br>
    The IOM-NRC report opposes a major government-sponsored thyroid screening program on the
    grounds that the harms exceeded any benefits, and argued that there is no evidence that
    early detection of thyroid cancer would reduce mortality. PSR offered qualified support
    for the IOM-NRC recommendation that, instead, the government should &quot;offer but
    discourage&quot; thyroid screening and treatment for anyone who believes that he/she was
    at high risk from iodine fallout, so long as the final decisions are made jointly by
    individual patients and their physicians.<br>
    <br>
    In PSR's view, such an approach is acceptable only as interim step which is accompanied by
    a major research effort. Some experts believe - contrary to the IOM-NRC report's
    contention - that it will be possible to identify individuals at highest risk with
    reasonable certainty. If this proves to be true, then a carefully planned screening
    program for this sub-group of millions who were exposed might be effective and yield
    valuable new knowledge. <br>
    <br>
    Physicians for Social Responsibility, which helped force last year's release of the
    long-suppressed National Cancer Institute study of radioactive iodine fallout from U.S.
    nuclear weapons tests, declared that the IOM-NRC report does not go far enough in several
    areas.<br>
    <br>
    First, the report does not clearly call for further research on diagnostic methods and
    treatment choices for groups that are at high risk of thyroid diseases from iodine-131
    fallout.<br>
    <br>
    Second, the report does not adequately identify the federal government's responsibility
    for creating the iodine fallout through nuclear weapons tests or its obligation to those
    who have been injured and put at risk.The report does not emphasize the federal
    government's decades-long record of suppressing information, falsely denying risks,
    ignoring public health concerns, conducting inadequate monitoring, and stalling the
    production and release of scientific reports on the effects of fallout.<br>
    <br>
    Third, the report does not address the identification and treatment of people who suffer
    from other thyroid diseases as a result of exposure to nuclear testing fallout. PSR
    believes that all funding for health studies related to nuclear weapons should be removed
    from the Department of Energy and transferred to the Centers for Disease Control.<br>
    <br>
    PSR also believes that the U.S. program of testing, manufacturing and stockpiling nuclear
    weapons has created unacceptable health risks for the American people and urges the U.S.
    government to work toward eliminating all nuclear weapons from the Earth.<br>
    <br>
    Background materials and interviews with experts available on request.<br>

    Physicians for Social Responsibility is an organization of health care professionals and
    others working to end nuclear testing and abolish nuclear weapons. It is the U.S.
    affiliate ofInternational Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, recipient of the
    1985 Nobel Peace Prize.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
