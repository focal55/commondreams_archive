    - September 21 - In a victory for human rights in East Timor, the House of Representatives
    voted to continue bans on military training and weapons to Indonesia. The Foreign
    Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act (HR 4569) includes
    provisions restricting use of weapons in Indonesian-occupied East Timor and restricting
    International Military Education and Training aid.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No matter what may be&nbsp; distracting Washington right now, the Foreign Operations
    bill sends a clear message that the House of Representatives is watching carefully the
    behavior of the Indonesian armed forces, especially in East Timor,&quot;&nbsp; said Lynn
    Fredriksson, Washington Representative of the<br>
    East Timor Action Network (ETAN). &quot;By restricting training and use of U.S. weapons,
    Congress is saying that a normal relationship with the Indonesian military is impossible
    without a just resolution in East Timor and a genuine democratic transition in
    Indonesia.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Foreign Operations appropriations bill, passed by the House on September 17, would
    continue the ban on IMET (International Military and Education Training) aid to Indonesia,
    allowing only expanded IMET. Expanded IMET is supposed to be restricted to classroom
    training in non-tactical matters such as civilian-military relations.<br>
    <br>
    The bill also calls for a detailed report of all overseas military training for foreign
    militaries conducted or planned by the Pentagon. This provision resulted from the
    controversy over Joint Combined Exchange Training&nbsp; (JCET) of the Indonesian military
    revealed by ETAN and others earlier this year. <br>
    <br>
    The House also affirmed current law by retaining the ban on the use of U.S. weapons in
    East Timor. The foreign operations bill states that &quot;any agreement for the sale,
    transfer, or licensing of any lethal equipment or helicopter for Indonesia ... shall state
    that the United States expects that the items will not be used in East Timor.&quot; The
    Senate version of the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill is stronger, saying flatly
    that any agreement&nbsp; &quot;shall state that such items will not be used in East
    Timor.&quot; The Senate bill passed September 3. <br>
    <br>
    In the report accompanying the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, the House of
    Representatives Appropriations Committee urged the Indonesian government &quot;to take
    bold and innovative steps to deal with the East Timor issue. In this regard, the Committee
    supports an internationally supervised referendum to determine a comprehensive settlement
    of the political status of East Timor.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The report stated that the committee was &quot;very disturbed&quot; that Indonesia had
    received military training&nbsp; through the JCET (Joint Combined Exchange Training)
    program, saying it was &quot;certainly inconsistent with the &#145;spirit'&quot;of the
    IMET ban.&nbsp; The report said &quot;the Committee emphasizes that it remains the
    Committee's firm belief that at the present time all military training for Indonesia
    should be limited only to expanded IMET.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The House and Senate must still reconcile differing versions of the Foreign Operations
    Appropriations bill before becoming law.<br>
    <br>
    On July 10, the Senate unanimously passed&nbsp; Senate Resolution 237. The resolution
    urges the Clinton administration to &quot;work actively, through the United Nations and
    with United States allies, ... to support an internationally supervised referendum on
    self-determination.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Over 100 members of the House sent separate letters on September 9&nbsp; to President
    Clinton and Indonesian President Habibie urging a just solution based on the wishes of the
    people of East Timor. The letters, initiated by Representative Tony Hall (D-OH), also
    urged the release of political prisoners, including East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao.<br>
    <br>
    On December 7, 1975, Indonesia brutally invaded East Timor. and formally annexed the
    territory the following July. The UN and most of the world's countries do not recognize
    &nbsp; this act, and the East Timorese reject it. According to human rights groups and the
    Catholic Church more than 200,000 &#150; one-third of the population &#150; have been
    killed by the Indonesian occupation forces. <br>
    <br>
    The East Timor Action Network/US was founded in November 1991, following the massacre of
    more than 271 peaceful demonstrators in Dili, East Timor. ETAN/US supports genuine
    self-determination and human rights for the people of East Timor in accordance with the UN
    Charter and General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. ETAN has 20 local chapters.
