    - September 9 - More than 90 percent of the tens of billions of dollars in government
    subsidies to the world's fishing fleets are administered in violation of world trade
    rules, according to a study released today by World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The study, The
    Footprint of Distant Water Fleets on World Fisheries, warns that massive
    subsidies&#151;including tax incentives, loan schemes, direct payments, and other
    financial supports&#151;are propping up a global fishing fleet now estimated to be two and
    a half times larger than what can be sustained either ecologically or economically. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;These subsidies are staggering. Governments are subsidizing overexpansion of the
    world&#146;s fishing fleets that are conservatively estimated to reach 20-25 cents for
    every dollar earned by fishermen worldwide,&#148; said David Schorr, director of
    WWF&#146;s sustainable commerce program. &#147;With 70 percent of the world&#146;s most
    valuable fisheries overfished or nearly so, governments continue to promote an industry
    whose size and practices are a recipe for economic ruin. The time has come for new and
    more effective international rules to control fishing subsidies.&#148; <br>
    <br>
    According to recent estimates, the world's fishing nations, including the United States,
    China, Japan, the Russian Federation, Norway, Korea, and the European Union, collectively
    pay between $15 and $54 billion each year in fishing subsidies. Many of these subsidies
    support distant water fleets that are already too large given the available fish
    resources. The U.S. pays approximately $400,000 per boat to help its fishermen obtain
    access to tuna fisheries in the South Pacific. And in 1996, the EU spent $252
    million--one-third of its annual fisheries budget--on access agreements for its distant
    water fleets. <br>
    <br>
    The subsidies findings are a part of a larger report which explores the ecological and
    economic issues associated with distant water fishing fleets (vessels fishing outside the
    waters surrounding its territories). According to the study, since World War II,
    governments have increasingly supported distant fishing fleets as their own coastal fish
    stocks have disappeared and market demand for fish products has increased. The report
    finds that distant water fleets have taken a heavy toll on remote, unprotected fisheries
    -- causing important stocks to plummet and permitting poachers the ability to operate with
    virtual impunity. Developing countries are often particularly disadvantaged by these
    practices. <br>
    <br>
    &#147;Distant water fishing fleets pose a major problem to the health of world
    fisheries,&#148; said Scott Burns, director of WWF&#146;s marine program. &#147;WWF is
    concerned about the impact of these fleets on already depleted fish stocks, and on the
    economic viability of local fishing communities, especially in the developing world.&#148;
    <br>
    <br>
    WWF is calling on governments to:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">immediately ratify the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which sets
        new international norms for responsible fishing; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">establish a model access agreement that would help
        developing nations negotiate better terms for access to their fisheries; and </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">negotiate stronger and more effective international laws to
        reduce fleet overcapacity and to discipline both markets and government subsidies to the
        fisheries sector.<br>
        <br>
        The WWF study is being released as governments of fishing nations move towards the close
        of negotiations over an unprecedented agreement to address fishing industry overcapacity
        at the United Nation&#146;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and as world trade
        officials begin to negotiate the agenda for a new round of global trade talks. President
        Clinton and European leaders have called for a special meeting next spring to discuss how
        trade rules can better reflect environmental priorities. Fishery subsidies may have a
        prominent place on that agenda. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This report is also being released in Brussels, Belgium. <br>

        World Wildlife Fund, known worldwide by its panda logo, leads international efforts to
        save life on earth. Between now and the year 2000, WWF, through the Living Planet
        Campaign, will engage the global community to take bold action on behalf of the
        world&#146;s wildlife and wild places. </font></li>
