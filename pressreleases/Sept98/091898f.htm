    - September 18 - Broad new opposition surfaced this week to Senate Bill 981, the
    regulatory rollback bill. Public health, consumer, tobacco control and food safety groups
    sent letters to all senators detailing the harmful effects the legislation would have on
    their constituencies.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This has been a corporate special interests' dream bill,&quot; said Joan Claybrook,
    president of Public Citizen. &quot;The action has been mostly behind closed doors. People
    are only now becoming aware of just how broad and devastating its impact would be.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    S. 981, sponsored by Sens. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), would tie up
    federal agencies charged with protecting public health, worker safety, food safety,
    environmental quality and civil rights in red tape and legal uncertainty, delaying and
    weakening their ability to issue strong safeguards. Its &quot;regulatory obstacle
    course&quot; of risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, net cost-benefit determination and
    &quot;conflict of interest&quot; peer review would tilt the playing field toward
    protecting industry profits rather than the public.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Managed care reform legislation faces powerful opponents in the legislative process.
    S. 981 would allow these opponents to take a second shot at blocking or weakening whatever
    Congress has passed in the regulatory process,&quot; wrote 21 groups active in the fight
    for Patients Bill of Rights legislation. Signers include the American Federation of State,
    County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), AIDS Action Council, Center on Disability and
    Health, Committee for Children, Consumer Federation of America, Families U.S.A., National
    Hispanic Council on Aging, and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).<br>
    <br>
    The major food safety groups, including Center for Science in the Public Interest,
    S.T.O.P. (Safe Tables Our Priority) and Consumers Union wrote senators that &quot;Now we
    are confronted with another threat to strong food safety protections: S. 981, the
    so-called 'Regulatory Improvement Act of 1998.' S. 981 would essentially build a food
    safety regulatory system based on an 'acceptable' level of food-borne illness and death
    through net cost-benefit determinations. It would lengthen, not shorten, the regulatory
    process and give the regulated industries themselves first crack at blocking a proposed
    rule by subjecting it to an unbalanced peer review panel.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This bill is tailor made for Big Tobacco,&quot; said John Garrison, CEO of the
    American Lung Association. &quot;It would give industry-paid 'experts' closed door access
    to regulators. Strong public health protections -- like tough rules to stop tobacco
    advertising aimed at kids -- would never see the light of day if S. 981 becomes law.&quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    More than 50 public health groups joined Public Citizen, the American Lung Association and
    the American Heart Association in writing to the Senate to explain how S. 981 would impede
    FDA regulations to protect children from smoking.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The big business backers of this misleadingly titled bill would like to keep its
    real impact quiet so that it can be slipped into 'must pass' legislation at the end of
    session,&quot; Claybrook said. &quot;But these letters from health care, food safety and
    public health activists show that their stealth campaign isn't working. This is a bill
    that can't stand up to scrutiny in the light of day.&quot; </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
