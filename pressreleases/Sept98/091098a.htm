    - September 10 - The flow of campaign dollars has closely mirrored the flow of legislation
    in the 105th Congress, with special interests stepping up their giving at crucial phases
    in the progress of bills that affect them, a new analysis by the non-partisan Center for
    Responsive Politics finds.<br>
    <br>
    The study also demonstrates that the moremoney lawmakers took from a special interest,the
    more likely they were to cast votes benefitingthat interest.<br>
    <br>
    These findings are contained in the Center's new interactive &quot;Do-It-Yourself
    Congressional Investigative Kit,&quot; which will be launched on Thursday, Sept. 10, 1998,
    on the Internet at <a href="http://www.crp.org">www.crp.org</a>. The resource allows
    voters to track the relationship between their lawmakers' votes on key issues and the
    campaign funds contributed by special interests with stakes in those votes.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What we're doing with the Do-It-Yourself Kit is giving regular citizens a chance to
    investigate Congress firsthand,&quot; said Larry Makinson, the Center's executive
    director. &quot;They can see the key votes, compare them with the contributions, and draw
    their own conclusions. The interactivity of the Web makes this kind of research not only
    possible, but interesting and fun.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Among the trends identified in the analysis was the tendency of special interests to pour
    money into congressional campaigns at precisely the moments when the fate of important
    legislation hung in the balance. Giving tended to spike when legislation was introduced
    and just before committee and floor votes. Interest groups tended to even out their giving
    to Republicans and Democrats at the time bills went to conference committee.<br>
    <br>
    The months that saw the biggest jumps in giving by interest groups concerned with the 16
    issue areas the Center analyzed&nbsp; were:<br>
    <br>
    * June 1997: The height of the budget bill&nbsp; and appropriations debates. Issues that
    came up included airline ticket taxes, Medicare legislation, the proposed tobacco
    settlement, the B-2 bomber, and federal funding for logging roads.<br>
    <br>
    *&nbsp; October 1997: With Congress hurrying to adjourn by November, special interests
    rushed to get their legislative agendas through. Major legislation addressed in October
    1997 included an overhaul of the Food and Drug Administration (which concerned the
    pharmaceutical industry), conference committees on appropriations bills, and the
    introduction of proposed airline competition legislation and other major bills.<br>
    <br>
    * March 1998: Democrats unveiled their proposed managed health care bill, the House Rules
    Committee blocked a House vote on reducing the legal standard for drunk driving to a 0.08
    blood alcohol level (a measure opposed by brewers and distillers), the House voted on
    expanding timber companies' access to national forests, and the House and Senate voted on
    bills to spur more cable television competition.<br>
    <br>
    Contributions tended to lag in January, when Congress was out of session.<br>
    <br>
    The ties between money and policy also are illustrated by looking at who gets the cash.<br>
    <br>
    For example, all 52 senators who took money from gun-rights interests voted against
    funding computerized background checks on gun buyers with a user fee on firearms dealers.
    And just four of the 186 House members who took money from the gun-rights lobby voted
    against a measure the interest group favored.<br>
    <br>
    The &quot;Do-It-Yourself Congressional Investigation Kit&quot; is an interactive tool that
    lets users see how their individual representatives and senators voted on such pocketbook
    issues as cable television rates, food safety, sugar and peanut prices, and airline ticket
    taxes. Also covered are major votes on environmental, defense, and health-care issues.
    Issues are described, a time line tracking the correlation between contributions and the
    stages of a bill's progress is provided, and the relationship between how members voted
    and how much they received from relevant interests is charted.<br>
    <br>
    The kit is fully searchable and is presented in easy-to-follow charts and graphs.<br>
    <br>
    Also available to voters at <a href="http://www.crp.org">www.crp.org</a>&nbsp; are
    detailed, interactive money-in-politics profiles for every congressional candidate in the
    nation and fully searchable databases of federal campaign contributions, privately
    financed congressional travel, federal lobbying expenditures, and congressional personal
    financial disclosures&nbsp; - as well as reports, analyses, weekly Money in Politics
    Alerts, and the bimonthly investigative newsletter Capital Eye. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">-30-</font><br>
