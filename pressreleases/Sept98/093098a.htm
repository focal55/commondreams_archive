    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial" size="2">LONDON
    - September 30 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">New allegations of the massacre of
    ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo yet again underline the need for a full investigation
    into the alleged massacre and for the presence of international human rights monitors,
    Amnesty International said today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At least 16 people, 10 of whom were women and children,
    were reportedly killed last Saturday in the village of Gornje Obrinje. Among them was a
    pregnant women. The majority of the victims were reportedly shot at close range and some
    showed signs of mutilation. They appeared to have been taking refuge from fighting in a
    wood close to their homes. Local people told reporters that Serbian police or Yugoslav
    Army personnel were responsible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the Serbian authorities have denied involvement in
    the massacre and announced an &quot;urgent investigation&quot; into this incident they
    have consistently refused to hold independent and impartial investigations into such
    allegations or to bring perpetrators to justice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The pattern of human rights abuses and impunity for
    perpetrators in Kosovo is indisputable,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;Abuses
    like those alleged at Obrinje spotlight the need to protect the displaced and refugees
    from Kosovo and put their human rights on the agenda as much as their humanitarian
    needs.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Calls for them to return to their homes will be
    premature while gross human rights abuses are committed with impunity and are not promptly
    and impartially investigated and redressed,&quot; the organization added. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the international community is failing to give
    full effect to measures to monitor human rights and impunity. Last week's United Nations
    (UN) Security Council resolution (1199/98) emphasized the monitoring by European Union
    Monitors and international diplomatic monitors without addressing the need for access by
    specialized human rights monitors such as those of the UN High Commissioner for Human
    Rights who has been denied an office in Pristina and an expanded mission. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On 8 September the President of the UN International
    Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Tribunal) wrote to the Presidency of the UN
    Security Council highlighting how Yugoslavia's continued failure, in defiance of
    international law and the Security Council itself, to hand over suspects indicted as part
    of its Croatia investigations threatened to make the Tribunal's Kosovo investigations
    meaningless. The Security Council has so far failed to respond directly to the demands of
    the Tribunal, which the Security Council itself founded. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last week's Security Council resolution called on the
    Yugoslav authorities to cooperate with the Tribunal and to bring perpetrators to justice
    itself, but failed to address the Tribunal's principal concerns over the non-arrest of
    suspects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Next week the Office of the UN High Commissioner for
    Refugees holds its annual Executive Committee meeting in which, among other issues, UN
    member states will set out UNHCR policy affecting Kosovo refugees. In the face of borders
    which are closing to Kosovo's refugees and displaced, Amnesty International will be
    addressing state delegations with a report calling on them to share the burden of Kosovo's
    displaced and refugees and prevent their premature involuntary return while this cannot be
    effected in safety and dignity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International will be emphasizing that efforts to
    deliver humanitarian assistance are not enough, the rights of refugees and displaced
    persons to protection under international law, particularly protection under the UN
    Refugee Convention, must be upheld. </font></p>
