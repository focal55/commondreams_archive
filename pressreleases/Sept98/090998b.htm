    - September 9 - - The Sierra Club today defined suburban sprawl as the fastest growing
    threat to America's environment in a national report that ranks the 30 most sprawling
    cities. The report, entitled &quot;The Dark Side of the American Dream: The Costs and
    Consequences of Suburban Sprawl,&quot; is part of Sierra Club's national campaign to
    educate the public about the high costs of suburban sprawl, including loss of open space
    and prime farmland; wasted tax revenue; isolated, auto-dependent communities; and
    increased air and water pollution.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Since World War, the American dream has been a house in the suburbs,&quot; declared
    Carl Pope, Sierra Club's Executive Director. &quot;But that dream is turning into a
    nightmare of traffic, air pollution, lost open space, and higher taxes. The story is the
    same all across America.&nbsp; For decades, local, state and federal governments have
    encouraged people to move farther and farther out.&nbsp; Now, the costs of sprawling,
    runaway growth are clear and increasing. All across our country, cities and towns large
    and small are rethinking the costs of poorly managed growth.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The report ranks the top 30 sprawling cities in America -- the top 20 with population over
    1 million, the top 5 sprawling cities with population between 500,000 and 1 million, and
    the top 5 sprawling cities with population between 200,000 and 500,000. The report
    documents how poorly planned growth is undermining Americans' quality of life. In large
    cities and small towns, sprawl is becoming inescapable.<br>
    <br>
    All across America, sprawl is destroying open space, paving over vital watersheds and
    wetlands, creating air pollution by increasing traffic miles and road congestion, and
    devastating natural habitat for fish and wildlife. In addition, sprawl is forcing
    communities to come up with money -- often in the form of increased taxes -- to pay for
    building big-ticket infrastructure communities require, including new schools, roads,
    waterworks, and fire and police departments.<br>
    <br>
    In &quot;Dark Side of the American Dream,&quot; the Sierra Club offers smart growth
    solutions, many of which are already being tested in metropolitan areas around the
    country. These include purchasing open space, establishing growth boundaries, reinvesting
    in downtown areas, sharing the tax base more evenly between cities and their surrounding
    suburbs, and developing agricultural zoning policies. Other conservation techniques
    include educating the public, energizing grassroots activism, public referenda and
    organizing town and city meetings to establish open dialogue on development patterns.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need a sea change in the way cities think about growth and plan their
    development,&quot; urged Pope. &quot;We need to move away from the outdated and
    destructive planning and management policies established 50 years ago.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    With the advent of the Interstate Highway System in the post-World War II era, the
    American dream of owning a spacious home with a big green lawn nestled into the quiet
    suburbs became a reality for millions of Americans. While this growth accompanied
    prosperity and optimism in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, by the 1980s and 1990s, costs were
    out-pacing benefits all over the country. Between 1970 and 1990, almost 20 million acres
    of rural land were developed nationwide. By the mid-1990s, more than 400,000 acres every
    year were lost to the construction of strip malls, six and eight lane highways, housing
    subdivisions dozens of miles from urban centers, and all the services required to maintain
    this growth. Sprawl was transforming the American Dream into an American Nightmare.<br>
    <br>
    The report was released in each of the ranked cities and in 20 other locations around the
    country. At each site, the message was clear: Curbing sprawl growth is crucial for the
    future of America's environment, rural landscapes, dwindling open space, endangered
    species and depleted urban cores.<br>
