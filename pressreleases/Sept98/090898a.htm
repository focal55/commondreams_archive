    - September 8 - Human Rights Watch today called on senior Indonesian government officials
    to immediately cease efforts to discredit reports of rapes of ethnic Chinese women during
    riots in Jakarta in May. Instead, they should work to create a climate where victims of
    sexual violence might be more willing to come forward. In a new report titled &quot;The
    Damaging Debate On Rapes of Ethnic Chinese Women,&quot; the organization said the debate
    raging on whether or not rapes had occurred was obscuring other issues, including the
    extent to which the May rioting was organized, the fact that sexual violence other than
    rape occurred, and the need to make Indonesia a society where people of all ethnicities
    felt secure.<br>
    <br>
    The government statements are based on the fact that to date, not a single victim of the
    May rapes has reported an attack to the police, despite reports of rights advocates that
    more than 100 rapes took place. Advocates say the women in question are traumatized by the
    assaults themselves and subsequent intimidation, and, in some cases, have fled the
    country. Officials accuse nongovernmental groups of fabricating their data. Human Rights
    Watch said those accusations would only serve to further discourage any witness from
    giving testimony to a government-appointed fact-finding board. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;If it was difficult to persuade victims, their families, or their doctors to come
    forward before, it's going to be almost impossible now,&quot; said Sidney Jones, Asia
    director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;Who would want to testify, thinking no one was going
    to believe them anyway?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Human Rights Watch report notes that ethnic Chinese women have many reasons for not
    going to the police, including a long history in Indonesia of police extortion of ethnic
    Chinese and a widespread belief that security forces were involved in the May violence. It
    also notes that reports of rape of women in Aceh, in nothern Sumatra, during military
    operations there in 1990-91 are only now coming out now, seven years or more after they
    took place.<br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch acknowledges that there have been problems with some of the data
    collected because of the chaotic circumstances in which reports came in but said rights
    groups were doing additional verification and going back, where possible, to the original
    source. It said that once verification was complete, the numbers would probably drop below
    the figures initially reported. The organization stressed, however, that the key issue was
    not numbers, but how and why violence occurred and how it can be prevented in the future.
    It also called on the Indonesian government to invite the United Nations Special
    Rapporteur on Violence Against Women to visit Indonesia to meet with officials and rights
    advocates and explore these issues further.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></td>
