    that the lives of more than two million people in Sudan are in dire need of food and other
    emergency assistance.<br>
    <br>
    In the face of worsening conditions and widening famine zones, the Alliance calls upon the
    international community to come to the aid of vulnerable children and families in Sudan. <br>
    <br>
    Several years of drought, the threat of yet another crop failure this autumn, and the
    effects of decades of civil war have left much of the population without food, shelter,
    and other resources vital to survival. In many areas of the country, deaths from
    starvation are increasing at alarming rates. <br>
    <br>
    The Save the Children Alliance is an international organization of 25 independent members
    that work in more than 100 countries worldwide and have been in Sudan since 1950. Its work
    in Sudan combines the efforts of several member organizations, including the U.S., U.K.,
    Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Bob Arnot, a trustee for Save the Children (U.S.) and a medical correspondent for NBC
    News, has just returned from Bahr-el-Ghazal, where the situation is most critical. ``In
    civil wars like this, it is always the children who are sacrificed,'' he states. ``As a
    doctor, there is nothing worse than to stand and watch these children die. I come from a
    world with advanced medicine and technology, but I felt powerless to save these lives.''
    Dr. Arnot will bring the Sudan crisis to the attention of the American people through
    newscasts and documentaries throughout the coming week. <br>
    <br>
    Conditions in the south are most acute where armed conflict is the worst, forcing large
    numbers of people to flee their homes. Some migrate from one emergency food drop to
    another. Others move northward, where there is less fighting, but just as few resources
    and services. Far from home and unable to provide for themselves, many now are entirely
    dependent upon external support for their survival. More and more unaccompanied children
    are arriving at feeding centers, often malnourished and ill. The Alliance reports that
    more than half of children in the town of Wau, located in Bahr-el-Ghazal, are extremely
    malnourished and that nearly a quarter of these children die as a result of their
    condition. <br>
    <br>
    Save the Children Alliance members are providing both emergency aid to people affected by
    constant civil unrest as well as longer-term assistance to help families rebuild their
    communities and better provide for themselves. The Alliance is responding to the current
    emergency by meeting the immediate needs of children and families whose lives are in
    danger; helping communities rebuild and prepare for the future; and promoting a cease-fire
    and permanent peace. <br>
    <br>
    ``The world community has yet to realize the extent of the suffering and devastation
    currently taking place in Sudan,'' said Charles MacCormack, president of Save the Children
    (U.S.). ``But the reality is that the lives of millions of children are now at stake. We
    simply must do everything within our power to save the children.'' <br>
    <br>
    Meeting immediate needs of children and families in Sudan <br>
    <br>
    Save the Children Alliance members currently work in areas in the south, Bahr-el-Ghazal
    and Upper Nile, as well as the Transitional Zone within the States of North and South
    Kordofan, located in south-central Sudan. The Alliance provides emergency aid to children
    and families in need through: <br>
    <br>
    Emergency food <br>
    High energy biscuits <br>
    Supplemental feeding of malnourished children <br>
    Survival kits: pots, pans, mosquito nets, blankets, fishing equipment, and <br>
    cloth. <br>
    <br>
    Helping communities rebuild <br>
    <br>
    In addition to meeting the basic needs of children in crisis, the Save the Children
    Alliance helps communities develop ways to mitigate the effects of continuing and future
    crises and to promote a healthy environment for their children. Because it is important to
    provide families with the tools they need to rebuild their lives, members provide the
    following community services: <br>
    <br>
    Family reunification <br>
    Distribution of seeds and tools for resettlement <br>
    Replacement of livestock lost in droughts and war <br>
    Support for large-scale immunization campaigns <br>
    Training of community health workers <br>
    <br>
    A Call to Action: Toward a permanent peace <br>
    <br>
    Until there is peace in Sudan, there will be no semblance of stability, security, hope, or
    future for children and families. The Save the Children Alliance urges that: <br>
    <br>
    -- All parties in Sudan agree to a cease-fire and negotiate a lasting, peaceful
    settlement.<br>
    -- All parties respect international law regarding the rights of children to receive
    humanitarian assistance.<br>
    -- The international community ensures that humanitarian efforts are fully resourced and
    supported.<br>
    -- The U.S. government support all regional initiatives to bring about a lasting peace.<br>
    -- All humanitarian organizations share resources and more effectively coordinate efforts
    among famine zones and war-affected regions both in the north and south.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Save the Children (U.S.) has set up the Sudan Emergency Appeal, a 24-hour telephone line
    to accept contributions towards the collective effort of Save the Children throughout
    Sudan. The number is 1-800-403-0505. <p align="center">###</td>
