    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - August 27 - Human Rights Watch today condemned the killing on
    Monday of at least 37 civilians, including five priests and nuns, by rebels fighting to
    unseat President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The
    organization also expressed alarm at press reports pointing to rebel threats to destroy
    electricity installations at the hydroelectric Inga dam, which supplies the DRC and
    neighboring countries with power. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We call on the rebel movement to immediately order a thorough
    investigation of the killings and to punish those found responsible,&quot; said Peter
    Takirambudde, the Africa Director of&nbsp; Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch urged
    the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy to grant full access to the International
    Committee of the Red Cross to areas under their control. The organization also urged the
    rebels not to destroy the Inga power utility. &quot;International humanitarian law
    provides for the protection of objects essential to the survival of civilian populations,
    such as foodstuffs and drinking water installations and supplies. It also prohibits the
    destruction of structures containing dangerous forces, namely dams,&quot; noted
    Takirambudde.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human Rights Watch has received credible reports that on Monday night
    the rebels rounded up and summarily executed villagers and missionaries at the Catholic
    mission in Kasika in the eastern province of South Kivu. The massacre was apparently in
    reprisal for an attack on rebel forces the previous day. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebels overran Inga hydroelectric dam in the early phase of their
    offensive on the capital Kinshasa from bases in the southwest of the country. Since then,
    they have repeatedly interrupted the power supply to the capital, leading to the
    disruption of running water supplies to the population. Medical services and supplies were
    also severely affected by the outage. Following the recent intervention on the government
    side of forces from Angola and <br>
    <br>
    Zimbabwe, the military balance dramatically shifted in favor of loyalist forces and their
    allies. According to reports in an Angolan government-owned newspaper, rebels besieged in
    the dam area threatened to destroy the electricity installations if they were not granted
    safe passage out of there.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebels, who announced the Congolese Rally for Democracy on August
    12, appointed a commissioner for justice and human rights, and have repeatedly pledged in
    press statements and public rallies to restore democracy and respect human rights. Human
    Rights Watch urged that the commissioner undertake an investigation of Kasika massacre and
    restrain field commanders in the Inga dam area from carrying out their reported threat of
    destroying the electric installations of the dam.<p align="center">###</td>
