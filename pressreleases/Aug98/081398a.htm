    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 13 -&nbsp; In the aftermath of the tragic bombings
    in East Africa that took the lives of at least 250 people, analysts familiar with the
    region are assessing major issues confronting Kenya, Tanzania and neighboring countries.
    Among those available for comment:<br>
    <br>
    DENNIS BRUTUS<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor of Africana Studies and English at the University of
    Pittsburgh, Brutus said: &quot;We sympathize with those who are suffering from these
    tragedies, but we should also sympathize with those suffering independent of these
    bombings. In Kenya, we should bear in mind the repression of the Daniel Arap Moi
    government, which has jailed members of the opposition and used the army to put down
    protests. In looking at East Africa, what is being overlooked is the profound
    dissatisfaction because of the structural adjustment programs imposed by the World Bank
    and the International Monetary Fund. The debt burden means, for example, that Tanzania
    spends six times as much on the debt than on health care. If the U.S. continues to be the
    principal protagonist of World Bank/IMF policies, it is likely to face increasing
    hostility.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    ANWYN HURXTHAL<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One of the biggest stories in Africa is communities
    inserting themselves into politics and organizing civil society,&quot; said Hurxthal,
    press officer at Oxfam America, a relief and<br>
    development organization. Meanwhile, a huge famine is threatening East Africa, Hurxthal
    said. &quot;The bombings obviously warrant the attention that they're getting, but right
    next door, Sudan is on the verge of a huge crisis. Tens of thousands of lives will be lost
    if serious attention is not given to the current situation. We're at a point with Sudan
    where we can save people now instead of looking back and lamenting the loss of life. Some
    350,000 people are currently facing starvation -- it could go above a million. The
    networks have sent their reporters to East Africa -- they're just a hop, skip and a jump
    away from Sudan, and could help avert a major tragedy by alerting the public to it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    NJOKI NJOROGE NJEHU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Njehu, co-coordinator of the Kenya Action Network and public
    outreach coordinator of the 50 Years is Enough Network, said she is &quot;proud of how
    Kenyans immediately responded, generously putting themselves at risk in the rescue
    effort.&quot; She added: &quot;After the spotlight has faded, people will need to focus on
    the issues of continuing economic devastation. The problems surrounding international
    financial institutions, debt and reconstruction of African countries need to be dealt
    with. Political will and attention should galvanize the international community to
    confront Africa's debt crisis, landmines, poverty and famine which kill millions more than
    did the terrible bombs last Friday morning.&quot;<br>
