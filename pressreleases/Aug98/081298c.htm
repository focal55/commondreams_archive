    <td valign="top" width="553" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 12 - Americans United for Separation of Church and
    State, a national church-state watchdog group, has filed a motion with a South Carolina
    court to make permanent a temporary ruling forbidding the display of the Ten Commandments
    in the Charleston County Council.<br>
    <br>
    In August 1997, Circuit Court Judge R. Markley Dennis Jr. held in Young v. County of
    Charleston that a plaque of the Ten Commandments posted outside council chambers was
    unconstitutional because it violated the separation of church and state. In his opinion,
    Dennis said, &quot;Government may not affiliate itself with religious symbols or doctrines
    in a manner that suggests an endorsement of a particular religious faith.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Dennis' ruling instructed the council to remove the plaque; this week's court filing asks
    that this ruling be made permanent.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;With the forcefulness and clarity of Judge Dennis' ruling, this controversy should
    have been settled months ago,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
    United. &quot;Unfortunately, county officials have been unwilling to cooperate and have
    been dragging their feet for too long.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Government officials need to learn that the Ten Commandments is a religious text and
    should not be manipulated as some kind of political football,&quot; Lynn added.<br>
    <br>
    The motion for a permanent injunction explains that this case &quot;involves
    unconstitutional action of the first order: governmental endorsement of the tenets of a
    specific religion. Such action strikes at the heart of the limitations imposed by the
    Establishment Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Americans United suit was brought jointly with the American Civil Liberties Union of
    South Carolina.<br>
    <br>
    Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded
    in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied houses of worship in all 50
    states. <p align="center">-30- </td>
