    <font size="3"><br>
    </font>WASHINGTON - August 26 - The following statement was delivered at a news conference
    concerning the release of Dr. Abdelhaleem Ashqar from detention in New York in connection
    with civil contempt charges:<br>
    <br>
    Fear is corrosive of our respect for civil liberties. Sadly, our government has a long
    history of targeting a group of people as &quot;public enemy number one&quot; and then
    conveniently ignoring their Constitutional rights.<br>
    <br>
    We've seen such actions in previous eras -- from the wartime 1940&#146;s, when the
    government forced loyal Japanese-Americans into internment camps, to the Cold War
    1950&#146;s, when the &quot;Red Menace&quot; was used as justification for harassing those
    suspected of communist or leftist political beliefs. Today, when the fear is of Middle
    Eastern terrorists, it is Arabs and Muslims who are the target of government abuse.<br>
    <br>
    While Dr. Ashqar&#146;s prolonged imprisonment is troubling, it is only one example of how
    the government has targeted Arabs and Muslims for questionable or unconstitutional
    treatment.<br>
    <br>
    Most prominently, the INS has routinely used secret evidence against Arabs and Muslims in
    deportation proceedings, in violation of the basic right to due process. There are more
    than a dozen cases in this country of the government seeking to detain and deport people
    on the basis of secret evidence against which they can&#146;t possibly defend themselves.<br>
    <br>
    The ACLU is currently defending Nasser Ahmed, an Egyptian national who has lived in this
    country for more than 10 years. Although Ahmed has never been charged with a crime, he has
    been held in solitary confinement for over two years on the basis of secret evidence
    presented in deportation hearings.<br>
    <br>
    The government has also targeted Muslims and Arabs for civil property seizures and asset
    freezes, even going so far as to freeze the assets of an Arabic newspaper that resisted
    demands to divulge information about its subscribers. Once the government has seized
    property, the owner must first prove his or her innocence before it is returned.<br>
    <br>
    Unwilling to distinguish between criminals engaged in terrorist activities and the many
    innocent people who may share their political beliefs, the U.S. government has embarked on
    a campaign of targeting Muslims and Arabs on the basis of guilt by association.<br>
    <br>
    It was by that logic that Japanese-Americans and leftists were subjected to imprisonment
    or harassment by government agents. It seems that once the government has identified its
    target, the Constitution becomes &quot;public enemy number one.&quot; Who is next to enter
    its sights?<p align="center">###</td>
