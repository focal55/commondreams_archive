    Banning Job Discrimination Defeated; Congress Realizes Vote For Discriminatory Hefley
    Amendment Is Bad Politics, Asserts HRC</font></strong></td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 6 - The U.S. House of Representatives today defeated
    the Hefley Amendment by a vote of 252 - 176. The amendment to the House Commerce, Justice,
    State Appropriations bill, which would have overturned President Clinton&#146;s May 28th
    executive order banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, is a serious
    setback to the Far Right&#146;s recent anti-gay legislative crusade.&nbsp; The vote
    signals that members of Congress may fear a backlash from voters who overwhelmingly
    believe discrimination against gay Americans is wrong, according to the Human Rights
    Campaign.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Today&#146;s vote was historic.&nbsp; For the first time in
    the history of this country, the U.S. House of Representatives voted that discrimination
    against gay and lesbian Americans is wrong,&quot; said HRC executive director Elizabeth
    Birch. &quot;Religious political groups and their Congressional allies overreached, and in
    the process, delivered our community a strong statement from Congress that they agree with
    most Americans and support protecting gay Americans from unfair discrimination.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Republicans, Democrats, and independents in Congress did not want
    to add the official stamp of approval for anti-gay workplace discrimination in federal
    agencies. Most Americans adamantly oppose the Hefley Amendment and its goal of legalizing
    discrimination,&quot; said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Birch and Stachelberg praised Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) and Rep. Jim
    Kolbe (R-AZ) for their leadership in defeating this amendment.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO), was out-of-step
    with public opinion. A new poll released by HRC and conducted by the polling firm Penn,
    Schoen, and Berland shows 64 percent of Americans said they are against Congress
    overturning the executive order, compared to only 28 percent who support overturning the
    discrimination ban. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last week reaffirms the
    HRC findings with 72 percent of the American public supporting President Clinton&#146;s
    Executive Order against anti-gay bias in federal agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An April, 1997 poll conducted for the Human Rights Campaign by the
    Tarrance Group, shows that 80 percent of the American public says that homosexuals should
    have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this executive order was issued, many federal agencies had their
    own separate policies banning discrimination based on sexual orientation.&nbsp; This often
    led to confusion amongst government workers as to whether or not they were protected.
    &nbsp; Contrary to the claims of the GOP leadership, this executive order helps clarify
    the law for government workers by bringing uniformity to existing anti-discrimination
    policies across the federal government.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order adds sexual orientation to the list of protected categories
    for which discrimination is already prohibited, i.e., race, color, religion, sex, national
    origin, disability and age. In issuing the order, Clinton noted that this policy does not
    add any new enforcement rights, such as the ability of a civilian federal worker to appeal
    an anti-gay job discrimination case before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the nation&#146;s largest national
    lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country, effectively
    lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure that
    lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community. <br>
