    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 27 - The following was released today by Physicians
    for Social Responsibility:<br>
    <br>
    As President Clinton and President Yeltsin prepare to hold talks next week, a coalition of
    national and international organizations have joined in a campaign to urge immediate
    de-alerting of nuclear weapons. A letter to the two presidents, initiated by Physicians
    for Social Responsibility and Methodists United for Peace with Justice, has been signed by
    68 disarmament, religious and grassroots organizations.<br>
    <br>
    The United States and Russia maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert.
    The letter highlights the threat of accidental or unauthorized launch of these weapons and
    calls on the two leaders to take action to reduce this threat. The organizations call on
    President Clinton and President Yeltsin to discuss de-alerting of nuclear weapons at the
    upcoming summit. The groups urge the two leaders to commence mutual de-alerting no later
    than January 1999 and to complete de-alerting no later than Dec. 31, 1999. The letter also
    urges the United States and Russia to work with other nuclear nations to de-alert their
    weapons as well.<br>
    <br>
    De-alerting of nuclear weapons can be accomplished by executive actions of the two
    presidents. No legislative action is required to take warheads off their delivery
    vehicles, a simple action that would significantly increase the security of both nations.
    President Bush and President Gorbachev demonstrated the effectiveness of executive action
    when they reduced the alert status of strategic bombers in 1991.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to support from NGOs and religious groups, de-alerting also carries the
    endorsement of many heads of state, prime ministers and military experts. De-alerting was
    recommended in a 1996 statement signed by 60 generals and admirals and has been endorsed
    by the Canberra Commission and the National Academy of Sciences.<br>
    <br>
    India and Pakistan demonstrated their nuclear capability in May of this year. Russia is
    having major problems in ensuring the security of its fissile materials. Terrorist attacks
    are on the rise. In light of these and other recent events, the sign-on letter urges the
    United States and Russia to make de-alerting a priority topic in next week's talks.<br>
