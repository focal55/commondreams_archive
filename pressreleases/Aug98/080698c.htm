    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">GOSHEN, Indiana - August 6 - An impressive group of former world
    leaders, policy makers, and clergy has signed an Appeal for Negotiations to Eliminate
    Nuclear Arms. The Appeal urges leaders of nuclear powers to confirm and implement
    commitments to the elimination of nuclear weapons expressed in Article VI of the Nuclear
    Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).<br>
    <br>
    The bluntly worded Appeal was organized by David Cortright, president of the Fourth
    Freedom Forum (FFF), a private foundation specializing in international security issues.
    The Appeal comes on the 53rd anniversary of the first use of nuclear weapons against Japan
    on Aug. 6, 1998. Announcement of the Appeal on Hiroshima Day seeks to reinforce the
    devastating threat nuclear weapons pose to all human life.<br>
    <br>
    Citing the recent nuclear tests in South Asia, the Appeal argues that the tests &quot;have
    demonstrated unmistakably the peril of nuclear proliferation and the weakness of
    international measures of control.&quot; Calling for negotiations by the world's nuclear
    powers to comprehensively &quot;reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons is a series of
    well-defined stages,&quot; the Appeal is &quot;one of the most coherent attempts to
    develop a new security apparatus to ensure long-term stability and peace,&quot; said
    Alistair Millar, Washington Director of the Fourth Freedom Forum.<br>
    <br>
    Former Officials Urge World Leaders to Stem Deterioration of Non-Proliferation Regime
    &nbsp; Signers of the Appeal include former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Soviet Leader
    Mikhail Gorbachev, Nobel Peace Prize Winners Oscar Arias and Joseph Rotblat, Admiral
    Eugene Carroll, former Senators Alan Cranston and Mark Hatfield, Dr. Morton Halperin,
    Bishop Walter R. Sullivan and many others. Calling for a new approach to stem the
    proliferation of nuclear arms, the signers envision a two-pronged strategy that combines
    efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to new countries with negotiations for
    eliminating the arsenals of the existing nuclear powers. The United States, China, France,
    Russia and Great Britain combined possess some 35,000 nuclear weapons.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Growing concerns about emerging nuclear states such as India, Pakistan, and Israel,
    and the spread of nuclear capability to other countries are long overdue,&quot; said David
    Cortright. &quot;It is now possible to end proliferation by assuring threshold states that
    established nuclear powers reduce their arsenals over time, while they reverse their drive
    for nuclear weapons.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In the coming months the Appeal will be used as a foundation for an emerging worldwide
    campaign to abolish nuclear weapons, beginning with the gathering of signatures from key
    figures of the defense establishment and opinion makers. &quot;For years the question has
    been asked, 'What should be the goal of U.S. nuclear weapons policy?' Now it seems on
    average 70 percent of Americans believe the answer is the elimination or reduction of
    nuclear weapons,&quot; said Cortright. &quot;The problem today is not with people's
    attitudes about nuclear policy, but rather our leaders' stagnant position on nuclear
    weapons.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The full text of the Appeal for Negotiation to Eliminate Nuclear Arms is contained below.<p align="center">------</p>
    <p>&quot;Appeal for Negotiations to Eliminate Nuclear Arms&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The nuclear tests in South Asia have jarred the world into new awareness of nuclear
    danger. They have demonstrated unmistakably the peril of nuclear proliferation and the
    weakness of international measures of control. They have also cast harsh new light on the<br>
    persistence of the arsenals of the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain, and
    France, who jointly possess some 35,000 nuclear weapons. These two main components of
    nuclear dangerproliferation on the one hand, and the remaining cold war arsenals on the
    other -- can no longer be considered in isolation. They must be addressed together.<br>
    <br>
    To this end, we call for negotiations to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons in a series
    of well-defined stages accompanied by increasing verification and control. We direct our
    appeal especially to the nuclear powers, to confirm and implement their existing
    commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons in Article VI of the Nuclear
    Nonproliferation Treaty. India has declared a moratorium on tests and its willingness to
    give up nuclear weapons in the context of a global plan for their elimination. Today, only
    a commitment to nuclear abolition can realistically halt nuclear proliferation.<br>
    <br>
    The tests of South Asia pose great danger but, against the background of the end of the
    cold war, they have also created an opportunity that must not be missed to take action
    that can at last free the world of nuclear danger. The hour is late, and the time for
    action is now.<br>
