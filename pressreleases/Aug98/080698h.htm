    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 6 - The 105th Congress today continued its effort to
    strip away the safeguards of our national parks as the House Resources Committee approved
    three measures that will turn over federally protected lands to private interests and
    weaken protection of the parks, said the National Parks and Conservation Association
    (NPCA).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Some legislators in this congress are working to destroy the essence of the National
    Park System, which is to protect our greatest places for all of us,&quot; said William
    Chandler, NPCA Vice President for Conservation Policy. &quot;National parks are meant to
    be places for all Americans to enjoy, not havens for a privileged few.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The most potentially damaging of the measures approved by the panel is the so-called
    &quot;National Park Enhancement and Revitalization Act,&quot; sponsored by Rep. Roscoe
    Bartlett (R-Md.). The bill, H.R. 4158, is a national park giveaway, authorizing the sale
    and/or leasing of national park lands for residential use. Private citizens already occupy
    over 1,600 cabins, houses, cottages, and trailers on publicly-owned park land. These
    structures, along with the land on which they stand, were purchased by the National Park
    Service under special agreements that allow sellers to use them for a limited period
    before they are conveyed to the park. H.R. 4158 would allow these lands to become
    permanent private homesites within national parks.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, H.R. 4144, sponsored by Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), sets a precedent whereby
    people with wealth and influence can purchase private estates within our most beautiful
    public parks. The bill promotes a land exchange that would privatize federal property in
    park wilderness and establish a permanent private enclave for one affluent family. H.R.
    4414 would also radically alter Congress' original vision for Cumberland Island National
    seashore, a unique national park where visitors can experience the last remaining barrier
    island wilderness on the East Coast. H.R. 4144 would prevent visitors from experiencing
    the park in its natural state by exempting an area along the main road that runs the
    entire length of the island's wilderness area from wilderness designation. This was never
    the intent of Congress, which instructed the National Park Service to &quot;avoid
    motorized vehicle traffic&quot; on the main road when it created the park in 1982.<br>
    <br>
    The third bill, the &quot;Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act,&quot; would
    authorize the sale of federal lands located directly outside the Mojave National Park and
    Preserve for the development of a commercial airport of unspecified size to serve Las
    Vegas. The legislation completely overrides the formal local planning process for the
    study and evaluation of airport expansion issues; it fails to delineate the specific
    public lands that would be put up for sale or the specific purpose of the proposed airport
    facility; and it makes no mention of the environmental review processes needed to address
    potential impacts on the neighboring Mojave National Park and Preserve. &quot;All three of
    these bills mock the purpose of the National Park System, which is to ensure park
    integrity for future generations,&quot; said Chandler.<p align="center">------</p>
    <p>The National Parks and Conservation Association is America's only private nonprofit
    citizen organization dedicated solely to protecting, preserving, and enhancing the U.S.
    National Park System. An association of &quot;Citizens Protecting America's Parks,&quot;
    NPCA was founded in 1919 and today has nearly 400,000 members. A library of national park
    information, including fact sheets, congressional testimony, position statements, press
    releases and media alerts, can be found in NPCA's &quot;Press Room&quot; on the World Wide
    Web at <a href="http://www.npca.org">http://www.npca.org</a>.</p>
