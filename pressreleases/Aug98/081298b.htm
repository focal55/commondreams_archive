    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 12 - The following was released today by Zero
    Population Growth:<br>
    <br>
    Zero Population Growth has announced that the winner of its 1998 Barefoot in the Winter
    and Pregnant in the Summer Award is Richard Coorsh, spokesperson for the Health Insurance
    Association of America in Washington, D.C.<br>
    <br>
    Coorsh captivated the judges with his thoughts, or lack thereof, when asked why insurance
    companies cover the male potency drug Viagra but continue to deny coverage for
    prescription contraceptives. The August 1998 issue of ABA Journal from the American Bar
    Association (page 36), cites Coorsh as saying that Viagra cures a medical dysfunction
    while contraception is merely a &quot;lifestyle drug.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The award reads as follows:<br>
    <br>
    The Barefoot In the Winter and Pregnant in the Summer Award for 1998 is bestowed upon the
    Health Insurance Association of American and its spokesperson, Richard Coorsh, for the
    backward and insensitive thinking that lead to the conclusion that prescription
    contraceptives are &quot;lifestyle drugs.&quot; For this industry's shameless efforts to
    denigrate the importance of family planning and those who choose to plan their families
    responsibly, Zero Population Growth presents this award with all the rights and privileges
    thereto.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Obviously, this is a bit tongue-in-cheek to make a point,&quot; explained Peter H.
    Kostmayer, executive director of Zero Population Growth. &quot;But insurers refusal to
    provide prescription birth control to their policy holders is blatant discrimination.
    Calling<br>
    prescription contraceptives a &quot;lifestyle drug&quot; reflects an appalling lack of
    respect for women. While many health insurers rushed to cover Viagra, most continue to
    refuse coverage for prescription contraceptives. In fact, only 15 percent of all U.S.
    health insurance plans cover all five reversible methods of contraception approved by the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's no wonder, then, that women pay 68 percent more
    than men for out-of-pocket medical expenses. It is time the health care industry quit
    hiding behind cheap semantics and joined the 20th century.&quot;<p align="center">-0-</td>
