    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - August 6 - In response to today's passage of Campaign Finance
    Reform in the U.S. House, actor and president of The Creative Coalition (TCC) William
    Baldwin stated, &quot;The Creative Coalition applauds those in the House who had the
    conviction to vote the American people's conscious rather than party lines. Campaign
    Finance Reform is about restoring integrity to the political system. Now is the time for
    our country's leaders to take a stand for fair political reform.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;TCC believes money and its influence on the political system represents one of the
    most significant threats to our democratic process today,&quot; continued Baldwin.
    &quot;The time is here for sweeping reform in the American system of funding political
    campaigns, and the implication of reform is no less than the restoration of our democratic
    process and equal access for all Americans.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The proposal, sponsored by Republican Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Democrat Rep.
    Marty Meehan of Massachusetts, would effectively ban soft money contributions to political
    parties and restrict issue advocacy advertisements. Today's 252-179 vote on the bill
    demonstrated strong bipartisan support for campaign finance reform. New York's delegation
    voted 26-5 in favor of the delegation. Campaign Finance Reform now must be voted on by the
    Senate.<br>
    <br>
    According to Sen. Russell Feingold's office, the McCain-Feingold bill currently needs
    eight additional votes to pass in the Senate. Debate is anticipated for this September.
    President Clinton has publicly supported campaign finance reform legislation and it has
    been reported that he plans to sign the bill into law.<br>
    <br>
    In the past year, TCC has sponsored numerous educational forums across the country -- in
    Chicago, San Diego and New York -- examining campaign finance reform and current reform
    efforts. TCC's Conventions '96 brought the debate &quot;Money &amp; Politics: Are Dollars
    Buying Democracy&quot; to the host cities of the Republican and Democratic national
    political conventions. Leading authorities have come to New York to debate and discuss
    campaign finance reform with TCC members and guests. Participants in TCC's panels have
    included former Gov. Ann Richards, Sen. Bill Bradley, James Carville, former Gov. Mario
    Cuomo, Sens. Feingold and Paul Wellstone, Rep. Shays, Ann McBride, Ira Glasser and Fred
    Wertheimer.<br>
    <br>
    Last October, TCC led 250 volunteers to Massachusetts on a one-day signature drive to help
    that state place a Clean Money/Clean Elections initiative on the November 1998 ballot.
    TCC's group alone collected more than 8,000 signatures, playing an integral part of the
    successful drive to collect and certify 100,000 signatures.<p align="center">------</p>
    <p>The Creative Coalition (TCC) is the leading non-profit, non-partisan social and
    political advocacy organization of the arts and entertainment industry. It was founded a
    decade ago by actors Ron Silver, Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon and Stephen Collins, to
    educate and mobilize the arts community on issues of importance.</p>
