    Defenders of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen joined Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) and
    Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) in calling for legislation that would rejuvenate the Land
    &amp; Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and end &quot;congressional poaching&quot; of monies
    needed to protect parks and wildlife habitats. Schlickeisen released the following
    statement:<br>
    ------<br>
    STATEMENT OF RODGER SCHLICKEISEN<br>
    AUGUST 6, 1998<br>
    U.S. CAPITOL<br>
    <br>
    Good afternoon. I am Rodger Schlickeisen, President of Defenders of Wildlife. We greatly
    appreciate the opportunity to join Rep. Gephardt at today's event. He has shown
    outstanding leadership with this legislation to rescue and rejuvenate the Land and Water
    Conservation Fund.<br>
    <br>
    The LWCF is called a &quot;quiet program&quot; because it is not known by name to many
    citizens, but it is nonetheless one of our nation's most important environmental programs.
    From Yosemite to the Appalachian Trail to small-town playgrounds, this program has had a
    profound impact on the many Americans who have benefited from the thousands of areas
    acquired by the fund.<br>
    <br>
    The primary reason that Rep. Gephardt's legislation is significant is that it will finally
    fulfill the promise that Congress made three decades ago. In essence Congress made a pact
    with the American people to permit offshore oil and gas development in return for
    investing a small percentage of the royalties in a special fund that would benefit the
    entire nation. As you know, that promise has continually been broken. Although some $900
    million are earmarked annually for various LWCF projects, the monies have increasingly
    been diverted by Congress to other uses.<br>
    <br>
    As Rep. Gephardt's bill points out, the need to provide additional protection to our
    nation's vanishing wildlands and habitats is greater than ever. The National Biological
    Service warned in a 1995 report that the nation's ecosystems are in decline and many of
    our park and forest areas must be acquired quickly before lands and wildlife are
    destroyed.<br>
    <br>
    In his Earth Day 1998 address, President Clinton emphasized that the Administration calls
    for a 43 percent increase over five years in the LWCF. We applaud the increase but the
    crisis for our vanishing lands is so great that we must move even more rapidly. In fact,
    according to a report sent to Congress and the President in April 1998 by a coalition of
    more than 100 organizations including Defenders of Wildlife, a chronic funding crisis
    threatens the nation's wildlife refuges, parks, forests, and other public lands.<br>
    <br>
    Theodore Roosevelt IV, an investment banker who is the great-grandson of Republican
    President Theodore Roosevelt and chief spokesperson for the Public Lands Funding
    Initiative, warned on behalf of our coalition that our government is failing to uphold its
    responsibilities to provide sound and adequate investment in our public lands. He asked,
    &quot;How are the fiscal conservatives in Congress caring for and investing in this
    invaluable public trust? They have opted for two management strategies: wholesale poaching
    and trickle-down-to-nothing funding.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Congress is poaching from the LWCF right now. The House-passed Interior appropriations
    bill for FY 1999, for example, would appropriate only $130 million instead of $900 million
    for the LWCF. And although Congress approved a relatively high special appropriation of
    $699 million for the LWCF last year, to date congressional committees have not taken
    action on a list of projects submitted by the Administration in February for the use of
    about $350 million of these unallocated funds. The Administration needs these funds to
    complete nearly a hundred park and wildlife habitats.<br>
    <br>
    Rep. Gephardt's bill would remedy the situation in two ways. First, it would make the
    annual appropriation of $900 million automatic so that Congress cannot continue to
    underfund this vital<br>
    program.<br>
    <br>
    Second, the bill puts the Administration in the driver's seat in choosing which projects
    to protect. This change is particularly important to wildlife. The habitats identified by
    government biologists for acquisition on the FY 1998 list, for example, range from
    wetlands in the Everglades to important Yellowstone bison habitat. More than two dozen
    existing wildlife refuges have been identified by the Administration as needing timely
    additions to protect habitat.<br>
    <br>
    So we are here today to call for a bipartisan effort to stop the raids on our nation's
    vanishing lands, to halt the poaching, and to invest in the environment using just a small
    part of the royalties incurred by taking environmental risks. Congress owes at least that
    to the American people. The legislation proposed today by Rep. Gephardt will fulfill that
    promise to use the LWCF to protect our heritage of wildlife, parklands, and recreational
    opportunities for<br>
    future generations.<p align="center">-0-</td>
