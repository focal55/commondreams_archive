    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 20 - NOW leaders today called on the state
    department to honor its commitment to the 9 million women and girls living under
    oppressive Taliban rule.&nbsp; News reports indicate that if the Taliban is willing to
    stop protecting suspected terrorists, the US would consider granting the radical Islamic
    faction recognition as a government.&nbsp; US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
    the Taliban's protection of terrorists is one issue on which recognition would hinge.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;While we agree that the Taliban should not harbor terrorists, we insist that the US
    continue to deny recognition to the Taliban until human rights are restored to Afghan
    women and girls,&quot; said NOW Membership Vice President Karen Johnson.&nbsp; In the
    past, Johnson and leaders from the Feminist Majority have met with officials from the
    state department and received their assurance that the US government would not recognize
    the Taliban until the<br>
    Taliban recognized women's human rights.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I hope these news reports do not represent an attempt to go back on that
    commitment,&quot; Johnson said.<br>
    <br>
    NOW and other feminist organizations oppose any favorable treatment granted the radical
    Islamic movement that rules much of the country. &quot;Women in Afghanistan live under
    oppressive conditions most of us can only imagine in our worst nightmares,&quot; Johnson
    said.<br>
    <br>
    Among the restrictions Afghan women face are: a ban on outside employment; dangerously
    strict dress codes for women; very limited medical treatment; threats of violence if seen
    without a husband, father or other male relative; and denials of humanitarian aid.
    &nbsp; Women are denied their share of any humanitarian aid delivered to the country under
    the premise that the men will take care of the women. Also, Afghan girls are forbidden
    from attending school.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Taliban refuses to recognize the human rights of 60% of the population. I expect
    that the US and other governments will not reward the Taliban's criminal behavior to score
    political points in the wake of tragedies like the Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam
    bombings,&quot; Johnson said. <br>
    <br>
    She also expressed concern that any recognition as a government could give international
    corporations the green light to invest in Afghanistan. The Unocal Corporation is allegedly
    interested in securing a contract to build an oil pipeline across that country. NOW views
    any project that would help sustain the oppressive Taliban regime as a contribution to the
    abuse and suffering of Afghan women and girls.<p align="center">###</td>
