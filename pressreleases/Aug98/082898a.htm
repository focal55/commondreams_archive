    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - August 28 - Linking Russia's current economic crisis to
    widespread corruption, Human Rights Watch has written to President Clinton urging him to
    address this issue in his upcoming summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Corruption is ruining the Russian economy, but many people don't realize that it
    causes human rights abuse,&quot; said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights
    Watch's Europe &amp; Central Asia Division. &quot;To ignore these connections is to just
    miss the boat on the current crisis in Russia.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Russian government is riddled with corruption, and its current difficulties,
    including, for example, chronic wage and pension arrears, insider privatization deals and
    tax evasion, are often a consequence of corruption. Moreover, it has laid waste to the
    public institutions crucial to long-term economic development, the rule of law and human
    rights protection. Finally, it is difficult to overstate how thoroughly corruption has
    eroded public trust in these institutions,&quot; states the letter.<br>
    <br>
    According to Human Rights Watch, among Russia's most corrupt institutions are its law
    enforcement agencies. This corruption facilitates or is directly responsible for human
    rights abuses, including ill-treatment, extortion, and abuse in police custody;
    trafficking of women; and police harassment of refugees and ethnic minorities. Citing U.S.
    funding of more than sixty law enforcement training programs, Human Rights Watch urges
    President Clinton &quot;to make clear in meetings with Russian officials that abuse by law
    enforcement agencies and the corruption that facilitates it sabotage U.S. policy aimed at
    building the rule of law and protecting rights.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Human Rights Watch letter to President Clinton also identifies other issues that
    should figure on the Clinton-Yeltsin summit agenda, including violence against women and
    Russian foreign policies toward abusive regimes in Belarus and the Federal Republic of
    Yugoslavia. A copy of the letter is <a href="http://www.hrw.org/hrw/campaigns/russia98/clinton.htm">here</a>.<p align="center">###</td>
