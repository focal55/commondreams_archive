    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 26 - For safer streets, less congestion, and cleaner
    air, the bicycle is poised to become an integral part of urban transportation systems for
    the 21st century, says the Worldwatch Institute in a new report. Too often relegated to
    weekend jaunts and children's use, bicycles are emerging as a solution to some of today's
    most intractable urban problems. <br>
    <br>
    Putting bicycles to work could produce enormous savings, like reduced air and noise
    pollution, better land use, less congestion and lower health costs. &quot;Americans drive
    cars and taxis more than 1.5 trillion miles each year,&quot; said Gary Gardner, author of
    &quot;When Cities Take Bicycles Seriously,&quot; an article in the September/October issue
    of World Watch. &quot;Shifting just 5 percent of those miles to bicycles would save at
    least $100 billion.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Much of urban travel is already &quot;bike-sized&quot;: 40 percent of all trips in the
    United States (and 50 percent in Britain) are 2 miles or shorter. More than 25 percent of
    all trips are under a mile in the United States. &quot;Cycling could eliminate some of
    these short, air-polluting trips,&quot; Gardner said, citing estimates that 90 percent of
    emissions in a 7-mile trip are generated in the first mile before the engine warms up. <br>
    <br>
    Strong support from citizens and local officials has been driving new bike policies around
    the world. In several major cities in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, bicycles now
    account for 20 to 30 percent of all trips. In many Asian cities, the bicycle's share of
    trips is even higher, accounting for more than half of all trips in some Chinese
    cities-more than buses, cars, and walking combined. In stark contrast, bicycles are used
    for less than 1 percent of all trips in Canada and the United States. <br>
    <br>
    In addition to bicycles' environmental and health benefits, mayors all over the world are
    finding that bicycles can also fight crime and cut administrative costs. City inspectors,
    health workers, meter readers, parks and recreation officials, paramedics, and a host of
    other employees can use bikes for at least some of their work. <br>
    <br>
    Bicycle use by police departments has mushroomed in the past decade. The International
    Police Mountain Bike Association (IPMBA) estimates that more than 2,000 police departments
    in the United States, Canada, Australia, Iceland, and Russia have bicycle units, with some
    10,000 officers on bikes. <br>
    <br>
    Even better, the IPMBA reports that half of the police departments it surveyed saw a jump
    in arrest rates-by an average of 24 percent-when bicycles were introduced into patrol
    areas. Putting cops on bikes also improves community relations and cuts costs. <br>
    <br>
    The average car costs 12 cents per mile to operate, while bicycles run for less than 1
    cent per mile. One patrol car costs about $23,000 and requires $3,000 to $4,000 each year
    in maintenance. One police bicycle costs about $1,000 and requires $100 each year in
    maintenance. <br>
    <br>
    Gardner cites numerous examples of how cities around the world are encouraging the use of
    bicycles by making inexpensive but effective changes in their transportation systems: <br>
    <br>
    In Muenster, Germany, bus lanes can be used by bicycles, but not by cars. Special lanes
    near intersections feed cyclists to a stop area ahead of cars, while an advance green
    light for cyclists ensures that they get through the intersection before cars behind them
    begin to move. <br>
    <br>
    In Japan, local governments bolstered the &quot;bike and ride&quot; link with railways.
    The number of train station bike parking spaces rose from 600,000 in 1977 to nearly 2.4
    million in 1987, maintaining the high levels of railway use despite rising levels of car
    ownership. (Construction of covered and locked bike racks costs from $50 to $500 per
    space-a fraction of the $12,000 to $18,000 to build garage space for each car.) <br>
    <br>
    In Lima, Peru, the city set up a micro-credit program to help low-income citizens buy
    bicycles. By eliminating dependence on public transportation, which runs about $25 per
    month, workers making $200 per month would see their income effectively rise by 8 percent
    during the repayment period, and by more than 12 percent once the loan is paid off. <br>
    <br>
    Copenhagen's City Bike program makes 2,300 bicycles available for public use around the
    city. Users pay 20 krona (about $3) to check out a two-wheeler, but the fee is refunded
    when the bike is returned. The bikes are intensively used: a Danish newspaper reported
    that the City Bike it tracked for 12 hours spent only 8 minutes at bike stands waiting for
    new patrons. This program is a public-private partnership, with businesses buying the
    bikes in return for advertising space on the bikes. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;By 2025, the share of people living in cities is expected to reach 5 billion,&quot;
    said Gardner. &quot;Increasing bicycle use will be key to making the urban habitat, now
    home to nearly half of humanity, a far more livable space.&quot; <p align="center">###</td>
