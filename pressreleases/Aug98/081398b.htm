    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - August 13 - An analysis released today by the Environmental
    Defense Fund (EDF) shows that US cities are expected to experience many more days over 90,
    95 and 100°F in the future than they currently average unless swift action is taken to
    bring global warming under control. The analysis is available free at <a href="http://www.edf.org/90Plus">http://www.edf.org/90Plus</a>&nbsp; on the World Wide
    Web. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;This year's devastating heat waves and tragic heat-related deaths may provide a
    picture of a typical summer of the future unless emissions of greenhouse gases are
    significantly reduced,&quot; said EDF scientist Dr. Janine Bloomfield. &quot;Our analysis
    shows that without greenhouse gas controls many cities across the US can be expected to
    experience a substantial increase in very warm days by the year 2100. Children, the
    elderly and those already weakened by illness are especially vulnerable to heat-related
    illness and even mortality during prolonged periods of hot weather.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    For example, the medium warming scenario (plus 3.6°F) shows the following yearly
    averages: <br>
    <br>
    -Miami currently averages 23 days over 90 F, by 2100 it could average 121, a 98 day
    increase <br>
    -Houston currently averages 89 days over 90 F, by 2100 it could average 132, a 43 day
    increase <br>
    -Washington, DC currently averages 32 days over 90 F, by 2100 it could average 58, a 26
    day increase <br>
    <br>
    The analysis is based on the range of findings of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on
    Climate Change (IPCC), an international group of thousands of scientists advising
    governments on the scientific consensus on climate change, and historical weather data
    from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The weather data were used to establish
    the annual average number of days selected cities experienced temperatures exceeding 90,
    95, and 100°F. These averages were compared to three scenarios for climate change that
    span the IPCC range of scenarios for the year 2100: increases over current average
    temperatures of 1.8°F (low), 3.6°F (medium), and 5.4°F (high). The medium scenario
    represents the IPCC's current best estimate of projected temperature increases for the
    year 2100 due to global climate change. <br>
    <br>
    The analysis also ranks 34 cities by their increase in number of days over 90, 95, and
    100°F using the medium warming scenario (plus 3.6°F). The rankings are available free at
    http://www.edf.org/90Plus/rank.html on the web. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;If we want our grandchildren to inherit a safe and stable climate, it's critical
    that affordable early reductions of greenhouse gas emissions be started immediately,&quot;
    said Bloomfield. <br>
