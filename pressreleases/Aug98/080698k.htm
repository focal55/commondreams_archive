    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 6 - The following was released today by the National
    Community Reinvestment Coalition:<br>
    <br>
    John Taylor, president and CEO of NCRC: &quot;The 1997 HMDA data asks us as a nation to
    redouble our efforts. The American dream of homeownership is slipping away. After steady
    progress in mortgage lending to low-income and minorities in the early 1990's, the 1997
    and 1996 data reveal a slowdown that is troubling and disheartening to the hopes and
    aspirations of underserved communities across the country.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In 1997, African-Americans suffered a denial rate of 53 percent when they applied for
    conventional mortgage loans. This is more than twice the white denial rate, and is an
    alarming increase from the 49 percent denial rate in 1996. More than half of
    Native-American applicants were denied loans. Hispanics experienced a rejection rate of
    about 38 percent, which was also higher than last year's rejection rate.<br>
    <br>
    These high rejection rates translate into few loans reaching minorities. Hispanic
    borrowers received two percentage points fewer conventional loans in 1997 than 1996.
    African-Americans reaped a mere two percentage point gain in the number of loans in 1997.
    This compares to a hike of 55 percent and 42 percent in conventional loans for
    African-Americans and Hispanics, respectively, from 1993 to 1994.<br>
    <br>
    The percentage increases in government-insured mortgage loans for minorities is also down
    from 1996 to 1997 compared to earlier years. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fair lending enforcement has trailed-off,&quot; declares NCRC's Taylor. &quot;Big
    banks are becoming complacent because federal regulators are rubber stamping megamergers.
    Increasingly, large banks have subprime affiliates engaging in high interest and predatory
    lending. Denial rates for conventional loans are going up while the large banks are
    increasingly referring minorities to their subprime affiliates. Meanwhile, the Federal
    Reserve Board is approving megamergers without requiring lenders to institute fair lending
    monitoring, training, and reporting back to the Fed on the status of fair lending
    programs.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Conventional home purchase lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers has also slowed
    considerably. Low and moderate-income families received only 2.3 percent more loans in
    1997 than 1996. This is 13 times less than the 27 percent increase in mortgage loans from
    1993 to 1994. A similar trend is evident in lending to low- and moderate-income census
    tracts.<br>
    <br>
    Taylor continues, &quot;CRA enforcement is lackluster. About ninety-eight percent of banks
    and thrifts receive Satisfactory and Outstanding grades in the last three years, when
    lending to low- and moderate-income communities has declined. In contrast, almost 10
    percent of all banks failed their CRA exams in 1992 and 1993. Is there any surprise that
    early 1990's were good years for lending to the underserved while performance now
    lags?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Federal regulatory agencies must increase the rigor of their CRA exams. A recent Inspector
    General audit showed that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was not contacting
    community organizations for their input on the CRA performance of lenders. In cases where
    regulatory agencies have listened to community groups, lenders have been rated accurately,
    weaknesses in their performance have been noted, and lenders have taken steps to address
    those weaknesses.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We must all work together -- lenders, regulators, and community groups -- to reverse
    the 1997 record in 1998 and beyond. Otherwise, the American dream will vanish for minority
    and lower income communities,&quot; concludes Taylor.<p align="center">------</p>
