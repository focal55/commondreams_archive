    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 24 - Food colorings that cause severe allergic
    reactions should be disclosed clearly on labels or possibly banned, a national
    health-advocacy group is telling the Food and Drug Administration.<br>
    <br>
    The colorings come in two forms, cochineal extract or carmine. Both are derived from
    female cochineal beetles, which are raised in Peru, the Canary Islands, and elsewhere.
    They provide a pink, red, or purple color to foods ranging from ice cream and yogurt to
    fruit drinks and the aperitif Campari, as well as to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. <br>
    <br>
    In the past several years, doctors in Michigan, Switzerland, and France have proven that
    the colorings can cause allergic reactions, including sneezing, asthma, and anaphylactic
    shock. The prevalence of allergic reactions is not known.<br>
    <br>
    The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a nonprofit organization based in
    Washington, today petitioned the FDA to either revoke approval of the colorings or require
    that they be clearly labeled by name. Currently, they may be declared on labels as
    &quot;artificial color&quot; or &quot;color added.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    CSPI is well known for its criticisms of olestra, saccharin, sodium nitrite, and several
    other controversial food additives.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;A coloring that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive individuals should be
    required to be listed specifically on labels,&quot; said Dr. James Baldwin, clinical
    assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Medicine.<br>
    <br>
    Michael F. Jacobson, Ph.D., executive director of CSPI, said, &quot;No one should have to
    experience a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction just because they ate an artificially
    colored food. Food manufacturers should switch to other colorings.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jacobson added, &quot;Americans shouldn&#146;t have to repeat their experience with
    sulfite preservatives, which also caused anaphylactic reactions. Fifteen years ago,
    consumers died while the FDA delayed acting on CSPI&#146;s petition to ban dangerous uses
    of sulfites.&quot; The FDA ultimately banned the most dangerous uses of sulfites and set
    strict limits on other uses.<br>
    <br>
    Many vegetarians, Jews, and others who observe dietary restrictions have been surprised to
    discover that a coloring derived from insects is used in food. To protect those consumers,
    CSPI urged the FDA, if it didn&#146;t ban carmine and cochineal extract, to require that
    labels indicate that the colorings are derived from insects. CSPI recommended that
    ingredient lists declare: &quot;Artificial color (carmine/cochineal extract
    (insect-based)).&quot;<br>
    <br>
    CSPI urged allergists who have had patients allergic to carmine or cochineal extract to
    call its Carmine Allergy Clearinghouse at 1-888-653-7872.<br>
    <br>
    The Center for Science in the Public Interest is a nonprofit health-advocacy organization
    founded in 1971. CSPI is supported largely by the one million subscribers to its Nutrition
    Action Healthletter. Earlier this year, CSPI released a report, &quot;Protecting the Crown
    Jewels of Medicine: a strategic plan to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics,&quot;
    which recommended policy initiatives to reduce unnecessary antibiotic uses on farms and in
    human medicine. <p align="center">###</td>
