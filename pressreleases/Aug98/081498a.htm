    today by Handgun Control Inc.:<br>

    CONCEALED DANGER: Evaluating the Potential Impact of the &quot;Have<br>
    Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment<br>
    --<br>
    Nearly 3,000,000 people will be able to carry concealed handguns<br>
    across state lines and into most states if Congress passes the &quot;Have<br>
    Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment to H.R. 218, according to data released<br>
    today by Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI). The amendment, introduced by<br>
    Rep. Bill McCollum (R-FL), was approved by the House Judiciary<br>
    Committee on August 5, 1998; the full House of Representatives is<br>
    expected to vote on the entire bill when Congress reconvenes in<br>
    September.<br>
    The passage of this Amendment is particularly ironic, coming as it<br>
    does only a few weeks after an Illinois resident -- who had been<br>
    involuntarily committed to a mental institution in Montana --<br>
    allegedly brought his gun halfway across the country, ultimately to<br>
    murder two Capitol Hill police officers. Despite Congress' demands<br>
    for more expensive security installations to protect their own lives<br>
    and safety, the members of the Judiciary Committee found it expedient<br>
    to make interstate gun carrying even easier for thousands of<br>
    potential security risks.<br>
    In an effort to evaluate the potential impact of the &quot;Have Gun,<br>
    Will Travel&quot; Amendment, Handgun Control, Inc. collected data about<br>
    the number of licenses to carry concealed weapons that have been<br>
    issued in 40 states. (These are the states that allow the carrying<br>
    of concealed weapons and for which statistical data was reasonably<br>
    accessible. Because statewide data was not available for Georgia,<br>
    New Hampshire and Vermont, which all allow the carrying of concealed<br>
    weapons, it can be assumed that the actual number of license holders<br>
    nationwide is larger than this report estimates.) HCI researchers<br>
    found that an estimated total of 2,903,502 licenses to carry<br>
    concealed handguns have been issued in the 40 states for which data<br>
    was available.<br>
    With few exceptions, it is currently illegal for licensees<br>
    to carry concealed handguns out of the state that issued the<br>
    license. If this amendment becomes law, however, it would allow<br>
    all licensees to carry concealed handguns in at least 29 other<br>
    states across the country. The legislation would mandate<br>
    unrestricted reciprocity between 28 states that allow anyone who<br>
    does not fall into a prohibited category (such as a convicted felon)<br>
    to get a license to carry a concealed handgun (1). Reciprocity<br>
    would also apply to Vermont, where it is not necessary to obtain<br>
    a license to carry a concealed gun.<br>
    The &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment could also supersede state<br>
    laws in 14 states that have strict standards and police discretion in<br>
    issuing concealed-carry licenses to residents (2). These states give<br>
    local law enforcement discretion in issuing licenses and usually<br>
    require applicants to demonstrate a specific need to carry a<br>
    concealed handgun. This amendment would allow the Governors of each<br>
    of these 14 states to sign a waiver to allow out-of-state licensees<br>
    to carry a concealed gun in the state, even if the standards for<br>
    granting licenses are weaker in the licensees' home state than in the<br>
    states with much stricter standards.<br>
    The &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment could potentially impact all<br>
    states except the seven that prohibit the carrying of concealed<br>
    handguns (3).<br>
    Millions of people roaming the country with concealed handguns<br>
    would pose a danger to all affected states, but certain states would<br>
    be particularly vulnerable. For example, in 1997 alone, 46.9 million<br>
    tourists entered the State of Florida, according to Visit Florida, a<br>
    state tourism agency. Florida is just one of many states with a<br>
    large tourism industry which would be required to grant full<br>
    reciprocity to concealed weapons licensees from other states.<br>
    Ironically, Florida Governor Chiles' recently vetoed similar state<br>
    legislation. Utah, which will host the 2002 Olympics, would also be<br>
    affected.<br>
    Furthermore, state concealed-carry laws vary greatly. Texas, for<br>
    instance, would also be required to grant full reciprocity, but it<br>
    has far stricter standards for eligibility to carry a concealed<br>
    handgun than most of the other states that fall into that category.<br>
    Texas has strict residency, safety training and background check<br>
    requirements. The &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment would undermine<br>
    these standards, allowing millions of licensees with no safety<br>
    training, no knowledge of Texas law, and who have undergone less<br>
    thorough background checks to carry concealed handguns in Texas.<br>
    Additionally, Texas residents who are not qualified for a<br>
    concealed-carry license in their own state could get a license in<br>
    another state that does not have a residency requirement. Texas<br>
    would then be forced to recognize that license.<br>
    Armed out-of-state visitors would increase risks in many other<br>
    states as well. Sixteen of the 29 states that would fall into the<br>
    full-reciprocity category have no training requirements whatsoever.<br>
    Some states, like Florida, do not require the license applicant to<br>
    have ever handled or fired a gun. Two states, Montana and West<br>
    Virginia, do not require a specific background check. While all<br>
    states prohibit convicted felons from obtaining licenses to carry,<br>
    some states allow people convicted of violent misdemeanors or<br>
    stalking to get a license; other states do not. Regardless of these<br>
    discrepancies among state laws, the &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment<br>
    would make all of these licenses interchangeable.<br>
    The &quot;Have Gun, Will Carry&quot; Amendment would weaken carrying<br>
    concealed weapons laws in states across the country. Despite the gun<br>
    lobby's oft-cited support of states' rights when arguing against<br>
    federal gun control measures, this amendment would usurp each state's<br>
    right and responsibility to protect the public safety of its<br>
    citizens. Common sense and good public policy require Congress to<br>
    reject an amendment that will allow some citizens, no matter how<br>
    unqualified, to bring concealed weapons from coast to coast, and<br>
    potentially endangering every citizen they meet along the way.<br>

    Carrying Concealed Weapons (CCW)-The Incident File<br>
    For several years, the gun lobby has battled to lift restrictions<br>
    on concealed carry laws by claiming that licensees are all<br>
    law-abiding citizens who will only use their firearms to defend<br>
    themselves.<br>
    Well...not really. A growing number of permit holders have used<br>
    their firearms to commit crimes, or have had their licenses revoked<br>
    for crimes unrelated to their handguns. In Texas alone, over 1,600<br>
    concealed weapons licensees have had their permits revoked for all<br>
    types of crimes, including murder. &quot;Law-abiding&quot; citizens carrying<br>
    firearms can make mistakes everywhere they go. Moreover, with a<br>
    national &quot;concealed weapons reciprocity&quot; law, these law-abiding<br>
    citizens will be going everywhere.<br>
    It is important to note that these stories represent only a<br>
    fraction of the incidents that occur every week in America.<br>
    In many cases, neither law enforcement nor the media inquire about<br>
    the license status of criminals during arrest or even after<br>
    conviction.<br>
    July 19, 1998: Thomas P. Kelly, 28, of Groveland, FL, was charged<br>
    with attempted murder after shooting Amerida Dale Woods during a July<br>
    19, 1998 argument. Kelly and Woods had been arguing, when Kelly went<br>
    to his vehicle, grabbed a handgun and shot Woods. Kelly, a Florida<br>
    CCW permit holder, was also charged with use of the firearm in<br>
    commission of a felony, use of a firearm under the influence of<br>
    alcohol and aggravated assault. (Reported in the Orlando Sun-Sentinel<br>
    7/20/98)<br>
    July 10, 1998: According to Phoenix police, Toby Mack and Kenneth<br>
    April began &quot;to bounce chests and.start to fight&quot; during an argument<br>
    at a local mini mart. Mack pulled a gun on April, who responded by<br>
    pulling his own concealed handgun. April's friend, Mike Willey came<br>
    out of the market and pulled his gun, whereupon several shots were<br>
    exchanged by the three. When the shooting stopped, Mack lay on the<br>
    ground dead and April had a wound to the lower abdomen. Both April<br>
    and Willey possessed valid Arizona Concealed Weapons Permits.<br>
    (Reported in the Arizona Republic 7/11/98)<br>
    June 4, 1998: Steven Dobric, a CCW permit holder with no prior<br>
    criminal record, gunned down his estranged wife outside a restaurant<br>
    in Palm Beach, FL, before turning the gun on himself. The victim had<br>
    filed a restraining order one month earlier, accusing her husband of<br>
    abuse and death threats. Ironically, two days before the June 3, 1998<br>
    incident, Gov. Lawton Chiles had signed a domestic violence bill that<br>
    barred those served with such orders from possessing firearms.<br>
    (Reported in the Sun-Sentinel of South Florida 6/2/98)<br>
    March 23, 1998: A man being questioned by Middleburg, FL, police<br>
    concerning two murders fled to a men's bathroom in the police station<br>
    and committed suicide. The man, a concealed weapons licensee, had not<br>
    been been checked for weapons because he had voluntarily talked to<br>
    police. (Reported in the Jacksonville Times-Union 3/25/98)<br>
    February 1, 1998: A Concord, NH, concealed weapons licensee<br>
    accidentally shot his brother's 16-year-old girlfriend while playing<br>
    with his gun in a drunken stupor. A known drug-abuser, he had stated<br>
    that he needed a concealed weapons permit for &quot;self-protection from<br>
    people he thought were after him in connection with drug dealings.&quot;<br>
    (Reported in the Concord, NH, Monitor 2/3/98)<br>
    January 28, 1998: A janitor at Garden Spot Middle School in<br>
    Lancaster, PA, discovered a loaded handgun in a fanny pack left<br>
    behind after a basketball game. The gun belonged to an assistant<br>
    coach of the girls basketball team who forgot he had left it on a<br>
    bleacher. The coach's concealed weapons permit was suspended.<br>
    (Reported in the Lancaster Intelligencer-Journal 1/28/98)<br>
    January 19, 1998: According to Warren, RI police, a man found what<br>
    he thought was a novelty cigarette lighter in form of a gun. It was<br>
    not. The man &quot;pulled the trigger thinking a flame would come out,<br>
    but a bullet came out instead,&quot; stated police Detective Michael<br>
    Clancy. The gun had fallen out of the boot of a concealed weapons<br>
    licensee. Fortunately, no one was injured. (Reported by the<br>
    Associated Press 1/20/98)<br>
    January 15, 1998: A road-rage incident on a Seattle, WA freeway<br>
    turned violent when one driver pulled his concealed pistol and shot<br>
    his antagonist in the back. According to police, Ronald Beagles, a<br>
    concealed weapons licensee, pulled his 9mm semi-automatic weapon<br>
    during a rush-hour confrontation and shot fellow motorist Vernon<br>
    Mitchell. Tempers flared when Michell broke Beagles' rear window with<br>
    a baseball bat. Beagles responded by pulling his gun and shooting<br>
    Mitchell. (Reported in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 1/15/98)<br>
    January 11, 1998: According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Dana<br>
    Mason, a West Philadelphia janitor with a clean record and a<br>
    concealed weapons permit, used his license like a &quot;magic pass,&quot;<br>
    allowing him to purchase guns without a background check or waiting<br>
    period. Mason, according to court records, used this loophole in the<br>
    Pennsylvania concealed weapons law to serve as a &quot;straw buyer&quot; for<br>
    another man, a convicted felon and gun trafficker. Mason was only<br>
    caught after authorities became suspicious of a particularly prolific<br>
    gun buying spree. (Reported in the Philadelphia Inquirer 1/15/98)<br>
    December 22, 1997: John L. Pausch, of Tigard, OR, was charged with<br>
    reckless endangerment after accidentally firing his .38 caliber<br>
    revolver in a local bar. Police stated that Pausch was &quot;goofing off&quot;<br>
    when he removed his gun and began to simulate firing it. The gun went<br>
    off, striking the bar and causing $350 worth of damage. Pausch had a<br>
    valid Oregon concealed weapons permit. (Reported in the Oregonian<br>
    12/24/97)<br>
    December 7, 1997: According to police, Seminole County (FL) judge<br>
    Newman Brock, a concealed weapons licensee, pointed his .32 caliber<br>
    revolver at a fellow motorist. Police stated that Brock pointed his<br>
    gun at Neil Stokes after an argument over a parking space. (Reported<br>
    by the Associated Press 12/25/97)<br>
    November 11, 1997: According to police, 22-year-old Angela<br>
    Schlicher is lucky to be alive after she was accidentally shot<br>
    by her boss. The Greenwood, Indiana, woman was working in a<br>
    tanning salon when her boss accidentally fired his .44 caliber<br>
    revolver. According to police, the man, a concealed weapons<br>
    permit holder, was drunk at the time. Ms. Schlicher was shot<br>
    when he withdrew his gun from its holster to inspect it. The<br>
    gun discharged, with the bullet penetrating Ms. Schlicher's<br>
    arm and lodging in her spleen. (Reported in the Indianapolis<br>
    Star 11/13/97)<br>
    November 10, 1997: Two women enjoying a meal at the Planet<br>
    Hollywood in Indianapolis, IN, were struck by a single bullet<br>
    accidentally discharged by a fellow patron's concealed .32 caliber<br>
    Derringer.<br>
    The permit holder had bent over to retrieve a broken necklace, only<br>
    to have his gun drop out of his pocket, firing one shot. Authorities<br>
    pointed out that the permit holder should have kept his gun in a<br>
    holster. (Reported in the Indianapolis Star 11/11/97)<br>
    October 7, 1997: Hani Farah, owner of a Mt. Morris, MI, liquor<br>
    store, was accused of felonious assault on two liquor control board<br>
    investigators. According to reports, after the investigators had<br>
    seized an illegal gambling machine from Farah's store, Farah ran<br>
    after them, firing two shots. Farah, a concealed weapons permit<br>
    holder, had his permit revoked after this incident. (Reported in the<br>
    Flint, MI, Journal 12/4/97)<br>
    September 16, 1997: Former Broward County, FL judge candidate and<br>
    CCW license holder Daniel Blackman pulled his gun on an emergency<br>
    room doctor at St. Mary's Medical Center after the doctor refused to<br>
    write him a prescription. The doctor fled from the examining room<br>
    and summoned a police officer who confronted Blackman. Blackman then<br>
    pointed his gun at the officer, who managed to wrestle the gun from<br>
    him. In 1996 Blackman was accused of threatening to put three<br>
    bullets in the head of an officer after receiving a parking ticket at<br>
    an airport. Charges were dropped on assurances Blackman would receive<br>
    psychological treatment. Under Florida law, he was able to retain<br>
    his CCW license. (Reported in the Sun-Sentinel 9/17/97)<br>
    September 6, 1997: Five men got into an argument outside of Big<br>
    Willy's Saloon in Baldwin, PA. According to reports, words were<br>
    exchanged, and guns were pulled. All five individuals had valid<br>
    Pennsylvania Concealed Weapons Permits. Shots were fired, and five<br>
    people were injured, two critically. Five weapons were recovered.<br>
    Although only five bullets had been fired from three of the guns,<br>
    each shot managed to injure someone. Baldwin Chief of Police,<br>
    Christopher Kelly commented on how easy it was to obtain a concealed<br>
    weapons permit. Previous laws had required a letter of reference from<br>
    a local police chief. Chief Kelly used the rule to encourage<br>
    applicants to obtain safety training. Changes in state law forced<br>
    Chief Kelly to stop requiring simple safety training. (Reported in<br>
    the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 9/10/97)<br>

    --<br>
    Notes:<br>
    d) States in which virtually anyone who is not a convicted felon<br>
    can obtain a license to carry a concealed weapon. The &quot;Have Gun,<br>
    Will Travel,&quot; Amendment would require these states to grant full<br>
    reciprocity to concealed-carry licensees from other states.<br>
    e) States which give law enforcement discretion in issuing<br>
    concealed-carry licenses and usually require applicants to<br>
    demonstrate a specific need to carry a concealed handgun. If the<br>
    &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment becomes law, Governors in these<br>
    states could sign a waiver allowing out-of-state licensees to carry<br>
    concealed handguns in their states.<br>
    f) States which prohibit the carrying of concealed handguns and<br>
    would not be affected by the &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; Amendment.<br>
