    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> WASHINGTON - August 27 -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the truth about
    President Clinton's private life may be, many supporters assert that his public policies
    have been beneficial to American women. But some scholars are pointing to evidence that
    Clinton administration policies have actually been very harmful to women with scant
    economic resources.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In one broad stroke, his major legislative initiative --
    welfare reform -- rolled back the rights of all mothers who find themselves in need of
    economic assistance,&quot; says Gwendolyn Mink, a professor of politics at the University
    of California at Santa Cruz. The welfare law, signed by Clinton two years ago in late
    August, includes tough provisions for establishing paternity and requiring child support.
    Mink notes that &quot;these requirements compel mothers to answer the government's
    questions about their sex lives.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mink adds: &quot;So poor unmarried mothers must tell judges or
    welfare officials the names of the men they have slept with. In judicial proceedings they
    also have had to tell how often, where and when. If they refuse, they can be denied food
    stamps or Medicaid or welfare. But where are the defenders of their privacy? Don't their
    rights count?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mimi Abramovitz, professor of social policy at the School of
    Social Work at Hunter College, comments: &quot;The President's wide- ranging social
    policies are playing real havoc with the lives of poor women. The work requirements of his
    heralded welfare reform bill have thrown large numbers of women to the wolves -- including
    the governors who want to save tax dollars by spending less on the poor and employers who
    want to increase their profits by employing cheap labor... Women also represent the
    overwhelming majority of those who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid,
    food stamps and public housing benefits. All of these programs have been axed to the
    bone.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann Withorn, professor of social policy at the University of
    Massachusetts in Boston, says that Clinton signed a welfare law &quot;full of seductive
    lies and false promises.&quot; Among those deceptions are the claims that &quot;living
    wage jobs exist for all single moms&quot; and that &quot;the folks who have been
    disappeared off the welfare rolls recently are all better off, and have not gone back to
    dangerous men or other far worse situations for them and their kids.&quot;<br>
