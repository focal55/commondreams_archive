    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 24 - The following was released today by the
    Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee:<br>
    <br>
    Congressman Martin Frost, Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
    (DCCC) said today that the ruling of a federal court rejecting the U.S. Census Bureau
    sampling plan is &quot;terribly disappointing.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Republicans, for partisan purposes, time and again, have been willing to
    sacrifice the political rights of minority citizens in order to advance their own
    political gains. Sampling will ensure that minority residents of this country are
    acknowledged and counted. The suit that the federal court ruled on today was brought by
    Newt Gingrich and other partisan Republican leaders. It is our hope that this decision
    will be appealed, and reversed by the Supreme Court,&quot; said Frost.<br>
    <br>
    In the 1990 Census, more than eight million people were not counted. Most of these not
    counted were Hispanics or African Americans. To avoid this problem, the Census Bureau
    proposed the use of a statistical technique of sampling for the next Census in the year
    2000. &quot;Sampling&quot; enjoys widespread support in the scientific community, having
    being endorsed by the American Statistical Association, the Population Association of
    America and the General Accounting Office. According to a National Association of Sciences
    study ordered by Congress &quot;sampling was the only way to ensure an accurate census
    count.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Undercounting has a real impact in people's lives. Congressional districts are
    periodically adjusted based on the new population data, to make sure every citizen has
    equal representation. Billions of dollars in federal grants for education, transportation
    and health care are distributed on the basis of population. Therefore, undercounted
    communities will loose significant financial support for local schools, roads and health
    care services. Also, federal, state and local officials use Census population data to
    decide where to build hospitals, schools and highways, thus, undercounting will result in
    longer waits for medical care, over-crowded schools and more traffic.<p align="center">-0-</td>
