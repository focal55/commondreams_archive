    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">SEATTLE - August 18 - In the darkest traditions of backroom lawmaking,
    Washington State is replacing Washington, DC as the home of shady deal-making. Tomorrow,
    Senator Slade Gorton's office is hosting a strategy session for managing the nation's
    largest fishery in the North Pacific. His guest list is comprised imarily of top
    executives from the factory trawler industry. Gorton is trying to quietly placate factory
    trawler interests in his backyard, forsaking other fisheries which remain vulnerable to
    the return of these vessels. <br>
    <br>
    Greenpeace Fisheries Legislative Director Gerry Leape called the meeting a deliberate
    attempt to subvert the established legislative process for developing national policy. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is a textbook example of the fox guarding the hen house,&quot; said Leape.
    &quot;It is ludicrous to expect the same corporations which have mined the seas to the
    point of collapse to plan for a sustainable future.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Just two years after their failure to gain Congressional endorsement to privatize the
    billion-dollar pollock fishery in the North Pacific, the factory trawlers are now
    proposing a backdoor route to the same result -- the right to buy and sell fishing quotas
    among themselves. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;What the factory trawler interests are calling for is the next step toward totally
    privatizing a public resource at taxpayer expense,&quot; Leape said. &quot;When that
    happens, conservation takes a back seat to the corporate bottom line.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The proposal is the factory trawler industry&#146;s counter offer to S. 1221, The American
    Fisheries Act, introduced earlier this year by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens. In its original
    form, the bill would have eventually phased out factory trawlers from US waters, prompting
    intense pressure from the Seattle-based factory trawler fleet on Sen. Gorton to water down
    the bill&#146;s most effective components. <br>
    <br>
    Greenpeace is currently conducting a summer-long bus tour, educating the thousands of
    Americans who have come to greet the bus on the dangers of factory trawling, both to the
    environment and the economy. Factory trawlers have nets as long as four football fields
    that can catch millions of pounds of fish in a single day -- muc faster than nature can
    replace them. These giant vessels waste hundreds of millions of pounds of unwanted
    &quot;bycatch&quot; each year. They are destroying the marine food chain, driving the
    decline of other marine species, and depriving America's small-scale fishing communities
    of their livelihoods. <p align="center">###</td>
