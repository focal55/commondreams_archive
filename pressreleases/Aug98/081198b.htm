    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 11 - James Love, director of the Consumer Project on
    Technology, and Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential Action, today issued the
    following statement:<br>
    <br>
    We fear the BP-Amoco merger, announced today, will hurt consumers by raising prices, spur
    a round of anticompetitive mergers in the oil industry and dangerous concentrate economic
    and political power.<br>
    <br>
    We are asking U.S. antitrust authorities to create a forum for public comment on the issue
    of concentration in the petroleum and mining industries, and to solicit views on issues
    such as mergers and joint ventures.<br>
    <br>
    Today's announcement regarding British Petroleum and AMOCO suggests we may be faced with a
    series of mergers, as is now occurring in the telecommunications industry. In the
    telephone industry, the early mergers were approved without much thought as to how each
    new merger created an environment where the next merger was more likely. We think it is
    appropriate to consider in a pro-active way the larger picture, and how public policy
    objectives of efficiency and consumer welfare are best served -- either by competition
    among the many or collusion among the few.<br>
    <br>
    Insufficient scrutiny of this merger will soon lead to other mergers and a policy crisis
    in the petroleum sector, given the lack of policy guidance or a well-developed theory
    regarding concentration that will adequately protect consumers.<br>
    <br>
    Consumers currently benefit from low prices for petroleum, a consequence, in part, of the
    degree of competition in the industry. We do not believe giant mergers like these will
    hurt competition, and hurt consumers.<br>
    <br>
    It is also appropriate for antitrust authorities to consider the political consequences of
    concentrated economic power. In the petroleum industry, for example, BP has broken from
    the industry's tooth-and-nails opposition to any effort to address global warming.<br>
    <br>
    This sort of industry division becomes increasingly less likely as the number of
    competitors shrinks. The immediate issue here is BP's willingness at least to consider
    modest greenhouse gas reduction measures. The broader concern is that a diminishing number
    of competitors will tend to lead to more lockstep, and more politically potent, industry
    positions on public policy questions.<br>
