    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">SACRAMENTO - September 2 - Monday evening the California Legislature
    approved their portion of the funding needed to complete the Headwaters Agreement of 1996.
    EPIC has opposed this agreement since that time because it includes a Habitat Conservation
    Plan (HCP) - a permit to kill endangered species and destroy their habitat.&nbsp; With the
    approval of the State money, the largest remaining hurdle is the approval of the HCP.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pacific Lumber HCP has been in development
    since the original September 1996 agreement, and has been exceedingly controversial.
    Negotiated entirely behind closed doors and under tremendous political pressure, the HCP
    has fulfilled EPIC's expectation that it is nothing more than a license to kill endangered
    species.&nbsp; From the company's perspective, the sole purpose of the HCP is to allow
    them to cut trees that would otherwise be protected because they are habitat for a species
    on the brink of extinction.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after the new protections mandated by the
    California Legislature, the PL HCP allows the following:<br>
    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction of roughly 8,000 acres of ancient
    redwoods that are potentially marbled murrelet habitat.<br>
    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction of 3-4,000 acres of ancient Douglas fir
    on the steep, unstable slopes of the Mattole Valley.<br>
    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversion of the majority of Pacific Lumber's
    200,000 acres to &quot;even-aged&quot; forests (i.e., clearcut) for at least the 50 year
    life of the plan.&nbsp; Only the small buffers along watercourses will be allowed to
    mature beyond 40-60 years.<br>
    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radically increased herbicide use in conjunction
    with the rampant clearcutting.<br>
    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inadequate protection for areas at high risk of
    landsliding.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After spending two years watching the HCP
    process, and the past 5 days in Sacramento, EPIC staffer Kevin Bundy observed &quot;This
    is why endangered species are in so much trouble.&nbsp; The decisions about their future
    are being made by politicians and not scientists.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this deal, Pacific Lumber gets paid up to
    $480 million for roughly 9,500 of forest, only half of it old-growth.&nbsp; In most HCPs,
    landowners are expected to set aside some portion of their land as mitigation for the
    destruction that they are causing on other portions of their land.&nbsp; In this case,
    Pacific Lumber is being paid for its mitigations, a dangerous precedent.
    &nbsp; &quot;Maxxam bought Pacific Lumber in 1986 for about $850 million, and has
    extracted over $1.5 billion from the forest since then.&nbsp; Now they've sold less than
    10,000 acres that were already protected under the Endangered Species Act for $480 million
    bucks.&nbsp; These guys have got to be some of the best shysters in America&quot; said
    Paul Mason of EPIC.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final vote in the Senate was 28-5, with
    only Tom Hayden speaking against the bill.&nbsp; The bill barely squeaked by in the
    Assembly, with a final vote of 54-12.<p align="center">###<br>
