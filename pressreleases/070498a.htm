    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 4 - The following was released today by Ralph Nader:<br>
    <br>
    As the country celebrates Independence Day, which commemorates the individual rights that
    our forefathers fought to secure from King George III, the United States Senate is set to
    vote next week of legislation that would limit the power of individual jurors to punish
    irresponsible companies whose dangerous products injure or take the lives of innocent
    Americans.<br>
    <br>
    Consumer advocate Ralph Nader stated, &quot;The Revolution was a revolt against tyranny,
    especially arbitrary and oppressive restrictions on our 'unalienable rights.' One such
    restriction that provoked the Colonies' to rebel against King George III was the Stamp Act
    -- which virtually closed down the civil court system. Next week, in dishonor to our
    founding fathers, the new so-called 'congressional revolutionaries' will vote on cruel
    legislation that will stamp out critical parts of state laws and make the courthouse door
    less accessible to many Americans.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nader was referring to the &quot;Product Liability Reform Act of 1998,&quot; which the
    Senate is scheduled to vote on next week. That legislation would make it harder for jurors
    to award punitive damages against criminally negligent companies, bar suits against
    long-lasting products, pressure wrongfully injured people to take unfair settlements, and
    make most stores and distributors -- in addition to biomaterial suppliers -- immune from
    liability. The bill is completely tilted against consumers in favor of corporations, as
    evidenced by a special provision that allows businesses to continue to use America's
    courts without limitation -- while imposing severe restrictions on the ability of injured
    Americans to receive justice in their own courtrooms. Moreover, it would override and
    federalize existing State laws by taking away long standing common law rights.<br>
    <br>
    The leaders of the American Revolution relied on the common law to fight for an open and
    independent court system in which citizen jurors would be the decision makers. Indeed as
    Thomas Jefferson stated, Americans were resisting attempts by the British Crown &quot;to
    submit us at one stroke to a whole system no particle of which has its foundation in the
    common law.&quot; That is precisely why the Declaration of Independence deplored
    &quot;attempts at depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury&quot; and
    &quot;abolishing our most valuable laws.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nader continued, &quot;In celebration of Independence Day, the Senate is planning to vote
    on legislation that would grant corporate wrongdoers even more immunity from punishment
    and accountability. Over 200 hundred years ago, our founding fathers fought and died for
    the right of trial by jury. Next week, U.S. Senators, their campaign coffers loaded with
    business cash, will vote on whether to limit the power of American jurors to hold
    irresponsible corporations accountable. Citizens could commemorate our nation's birthday
    by contacting their Senators immediately at 202-224-3121 and asking them to oppose this
    legislation.&quot;<p align="center">###</td>
