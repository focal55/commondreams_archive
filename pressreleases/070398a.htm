    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 3 - The following was released today by the Aviation
    Consumer Action Project:<br>
    <br>
    The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) has sued the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) to overturn the certification of the new 550-passenger Boeing 777-300 without the
    traditional passenger evacuation testing. The stretch Airbus A330/340 airliner is also
    pending FAA approval for 440 passengers.<br>
    <br>
    To receive FAA certification, regulations require aircraft manufacturers to demonstrate
    that passengers can exit the plane within 90 seconds using only half of the exits. The
    reason for thisrule is that many passengers survive the impact of a crash but die from
    smoke, fire or water because they were unable to exit theaircraft.<br>
    <br>
    Paul Hudson, ACAP's Executive Director and longtime member of theFAA's Advisory Committee
    on Emergency Evacuation, learned inMarch 1998 that the FAA proposed use of paper analysis
    instead of full-scale evacuation tests. ACAP was joined by eight other national aviation
    organizations (see list below) in opposing this change and requesting that the proposed
    certification of theBoeing 777-300 and the Airbus 330/340 airliners be suspended pending
    final decision on the proposed new FAA policy.<br>
    <br>
    Hudson expressed outrage by the FAA's latest move. &quot;How can the public have
    confidence in the safety of new airliners if the FAAapproves them for service contrary to
    its own safety rules based solely on secret data submitted by the aircraft manufacturers?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Current emergency standards are already weak, with some aircraft failing their
    emergency evacuation tests and being certified only by bending rules. Emergency evacuation
    standards need to be upgraded, but instead they have been downgraded and perhaps fatally
    compromised. New potential Titanics will now be launched every month unless unsafe
    certification procedures are reversed and new aircraft designs are required to pass actual
    evacuation tests.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ralph Nader commented, &quot;The FAA has moved in to the world of regulatory virtual
    reality, choosing simulation of passenger evacuation testing over real life confirmation.
    This law suit is designed to bring the FAA back in to the real world of injury
    prevention.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    ACAP is represented in the suit by Nicholas Gilman, Esq., and Nicholas Cobbs, Esq., of
    Washington, D.C. The suit will be heard before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
    of Columbia.<br>
    <br>
    The April 1998 letter to Jane Garvey, FAA Administrator, requesting FAA to suspend
    certification of new and/or changed aircraft without full-scale evacuation testing was
    signed and submitted by the following aviation groups: Association of Flight Attendants;
    Air Line Pilots Association; International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
    Workers; International Airline Passengers Association; Association of Professional Flight
    Attendants; Allied Pilots Association; Independent Pilots Association; International<br>
    Brotherhood of Teamsters; and Aviation Consumer Action Project.<br>
    ------<br>
    The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) is an independent not-for-profit corporation.
    ACAP was founded in 1971 by Ralph Nader to promote airline safety and the rights of the
    traveling public.<p align="center">###</td>
