    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 30 - Protect Our Constitution and Protect Our
    Constitution/Human Rights Campaign, the two groups fighting the anti-gay ballot measure in
    Hawaii, have filed a formal complaint today with the Campaign Spending Commission.
    &nbsp; The groups charge that the Christian Coalition and its local affiliate, the Hawaii
    Christian Coalition, is blatantly flouting Hawaii campaign spending laws.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Christian Coalition is not above the
    law and has no special right to ignore Hawaii's rules on campaign spending. The citizens
    of Hawaii ought to be concerned when religious activist groups, like the Christian
    Coalition, believe they can brazenly disregard laws in their effort to impose their narrow
    views on Hawaii citizens,&quot; said HRC communications director and senior strategist
    David M. Smith.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state legislature has placed a question on
    the ballot for the November election, to determine whether the Hawaii constitution should
    be amended to grant the legislature the power to limit marriages to opposite sex couples.
    &nbsp; This has brought in a flood of religious political activist groups who want to
    export intolerance into Hawaii.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Hawaii campaign spending law, any
    group who raises more than $1,000 in support of a ballot question must register and file
    reports with the Campaign Spending Commission.&nbsp; Neither the Christian Coalition nor
    the Hawaii Christian Coalition, have registered.&nbsp; Yet, these groups have embarked on
    a full-fledged electronic fund-raising appeal with explicit instructions on how to give
    money by credit card. The Christian Coalition<br>
    is even electronically soliciting cash from overseas to help raise the $1.5 million they
    believe is needed to buy this referendum.&nbsp; Posted on the Hawaii Christian Coalition
    web site, in boldface type it says, &quot;Foreign Checks Also Accepted.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; If past pro-discrimination campaigns are
    any indication, this end-around by the Right could be the first of many unscrupulous
    tactics and tricks we may see between now and November,&quot; said Smith. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint was filed by Protect Our
    Constitution campaign manager Jackie Young and Smith, Protect Our Constitution/Human
    Rights Campaign's representative. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Today's complaint asked that the
    Commission declare the Christian Coalition and Christian Coalition Hawaii in violation of
    the law, compel them to register, and impose all appropriate penalties under the law.
    &nbsp; These groups need to learn that in Hawaii, there are consequences for those who do
    not play by the rules,&quot; said Young.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the largest
    national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country. It
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community<p align="center"> - 30 -</td>
