- June 28 - Human Rights Watch today praised President Clinton
    for his spirited debate on human rights with Chinese President Jiang Zemin but urged him
    to press further on four of the issues he raised: freedom of expression and association;
    arbitrary detention; Tibet; and freedom of religion. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is premature to call the summit a success in human rights terms, although we're
    delighted President Clinton spoke out as pointedly as he did, especially on live
    television,&quot; said Sidney
    Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;The challenge is now to take the issues
    that are on the table now and use the summit to secure concrete progress on all four. We
    obviously don't expect all problems to be solved in a nine-day visit, and we realize human
    rights is only one of many topics on Mr. Clinton's agenda. But the President has
    demonstrated that U.S.-China relations can be strengthened even as differences are fully
    and forcefully aired. Now he and his staff should use the remaining days in China to get
    down to hard negotiations on human rights, so that he returns to Washington with more than
    vague promises of dialogue and exchange.&quot; She noted that of the fourteen agreements
    announced Saturday, only two related to human rights, and neither addressed ongoing
    abuses.<br>
    <br>
    In each of the four areas, Human Rights Watch gave examples of what could be done. <br>
    <br>
    1. Freedom of expression and association<br>
    <br>
    The organization gave Mr. Clinton high marks for his assertion that the Tiananmen
    crackdown was wrong and for arguing that &quot;stability in the twenty-first century will
    require high levels of freedom&quot; in China. In the spirit of those remarks, Mr.
    Clinton, before leaving China, should get his hosts to lift the ban on Chinese
    pro-democracy activists abroad from returning home, arguing that many of these exiles are
    well-placed to provide the ideas for reform that will be critical to China's future. He
    should also secure a commitment that there will be no retaliation against Chinese in Xian,
    Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere who dared to give interviews to Western journalists or in
    other ways speak out during the president's trip. (Human Rights Watch is particularly
    concerned about Bao Tong, the former Chinese Communist Party official who called for
    political reform in recent interviews; Ding Zilin, an advocate on behalf of the 1989
    victims, who was reportedly ordered not to leave her home until Clinton departs Beijing;
    and Xu Wenli, a long-time activist.) And he should ensure that the rule of law programs to
    which the administration is committed include a focus on the rights guaranteed by the
    international treaty that China has promised it will sign later this year, the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. <br>
    <br>
    2. Arbitrary detention<br>
    <br>
    President Clinton noted he had raised with President Jiang Zemin the problem of people
    &quot;incarcerated now for offenses no longer on the books in China&quot; as well as those
    detained since 1989 for non-violent offenses, and said he asked if these people could be
    released. Now he should step up efforts to secure those releases. He should also ensure
    that any public references to agreed on law programs be used not just to praise legal
    reforms already in place but to press for an end to the problems that remain, including
    the system of &quot;re-education through labor,&quot; an administrative punishment of up
    to three years' detention in a labor camp for those who run afoul of authorities. The
    President could offer assistance to the Chinese government, as he implicitly did in the
    question-and-answer session on Saturday, to find a legal mechanism for review of the cases
    of the 2,000 so-called &quot;counterrevolutionaries&quot; -- a small fraction of the total
    number of political prisoners in China -- who remain in prison even though the offense of
    &quot;counterrevolution&quot; was removed from China's criminal law last year.<br>
    <br>
    3. Tibet<br>
    <br>
    Since the issue of Tibet was discussed at greater length than any other rights issue, the
    groundwork has been laid to pursue three issues of particular importance: release of
    Tibetan prisoners who have not used violence; securing verifiable information on the
    whereabouts and current status of the nine-year-old Panchen Lama, the second highest
    figure in Tibetan Buddhism; and securing improved access to Tibet for the international
    press and human rights organizations. (Access by the press to the Panchen Lama would be
    one way of verifying official Chinese government claims that the boy is leading a normal
    life.)<br>
    <br>
    4. Freedom of Religion<br>
    <br>
    President Clinton raised the issue of freedom of religion in broad terms,in the context of
    his remarks during the Saturday press conference as well as his own attendance at an
    &quot;official&quot; church in Beijing.<br>
    <br>
    Given subsequent remarks by Chinese officials that religious activists detained in China
    are not being held for their beliefs, President Clinton needs to find a way during his
    remaining days to rebut the Chinese government's position that freedom of religion is the
    same as freedom to believe, whereas in fact it embraces freedom to meet, train leaders,
    educate followers, and distribute material. He should also find a way of stressing that he
    is concerned over restrictions on the freedom of all religions in China -- Buddhism,
    Islam, and Daoism, as well as Christianity. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We have been concerned that the Clinton administration has seemed willing to
    sacrifice targeted pressure on human rights for an ill-defined 'human rights dialogue,'
    &quot; said Jones. &quot;President Clinton should came back from China with some concrete
    commitments from the Chinese government and a clearly articulated human rights policy that
    directly addresses each of the issues he raised with President Jiang.&quot;
