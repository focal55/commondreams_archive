    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 22 - The shape of things to come: Video
    camera-computer teleconferencing links that routinely replace travel; smart cribs that
    adjust room temperature based on a baby's body temperature changes; &quot;wearable&quot;
    personal computers that fit into eyeglasses and pockets and allow the wearer to work from
    anywhere; sensors and control devices that make lighting systems in buildings more
    efficient; communications systems that help cars navigate around traffic jams and save
    fuel, and precision-controlled automobile engines that help cars get up to 75 miles to the
    gallon. Most significantly, all of these products can be used to protect Earth's climate. <br>
    <br>
    And the shape of things today: Not only are these technologies of the future, but in many
    cases, technologies already in the marketplace. <br>
    <br>
    While debate in the United States continues over how to forge an economically-sound
    climate policy, a number of leading electronics companies have already developed or are<br>
    developing products that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    According to a new study released today, these products are lowering costs for<br>
    companies and their customers, and creating new market opportunities. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;How information and electronics technologies change our environment will be the
    product of choices by industry, consumers, and the government,&quot; says Frances Irwin, a
    fellow at the World Resources Institute, and an author of the new report, Taking a Byte
    Out of Carbon: Electronics Innovation for Climate Protection. &quot;We are convinced that
    the industry that launched the information revolution can make a big difference in
    tackling greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The report was released jointly by the Washington, DC-based World Resources Institute
    (WRI), an international research organization focusing on issues of the environment and
    sustainability, the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), a trade group of 2,100 companies
    representing the entire spectrum involved in the design and manufacture of electronic
    products, and the International Cooperative for Environmental Leadership (ICEL), a group
    of companies that works with governmental agencies and other stakeholders to advance
    state-of-the-art climate protective industrial technologies. <br>
    <br>
    Taking a Byte Out of Carbon illustrates how &quot;intelligent technologies&quot; place the
    electronics industry in a prime position to provide practical solutions to the climate
    challenge. These technologies have led to the development of products that more precisely
    calibrate energy use; make cars, appliances, buildings, airplane engines, and industrial
    processes more energy efficient; and assist in reducing the need for energy-intensive
    travel. By highlighting these activities the report hopes to increase awareness of climate
    protective technologies and stimulate further innovation. <br>
    <br>
    The report presents these innovations through profiles of 14 corporate initiatives that
    have developed &quot;smart products&quot; that also benefit the climate. Three underlying
    technologies are highlighted -- displays, bandwidth and sensors -- that help people work,
    live and produce goods and services in ways that emit fewer greenhouse gases. These
    companies include: AT&amp;T Corporation, Canon, Honeywell Inc., IBM Corporation, Intel
    Corporation, Eastman Kodak Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Mitsubishi Motors
    Corporation, Motorola Inc., Nortel, Panasonic, Sharp Corporation, Texas Instruments
    Incorporated, and United Technologies Corporation. <br>
    <br>
    The report highlights how electronic products reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money,
    and create business opportunities, including: <br>
    <br>
    Two-thirds of the $200 billion spent annually on electricity in the United States is for
    homes and offices. Households contribute 20 percent of all CO2 emissions. Electric
    utilities, by using electronics to help homeowners control energy use more precisely,
    could help customers save $58 billion over the next 15 years. <br>
    <br>
    Honeywell has found business opportunities in applying its electronics expertise in
    sensors and building controls to managing energy more efficiently. It has cut its own
    energy use by 12 percent, while concurrently reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 37,000
    tons annually. Honeywell expects annual savings of $4.6 million a year. <br>
    <br>
    Telecommuting, or teleworking, is another way to reduce energy use. Between 1990 and 1995,
    the number of telecommuters in the U.S. tripled from 3.6 million to 9.3 million, or close
    to 10 percent of the workforce. By the year 2000 this number is expected to grow to 25
    percent of the total national workforce. <br>
    <br>
    AT&amp;T estimates that its telework initiative of 36,000 workers saves 80,000 tons of CO2
    emissions annually. At its global systems division in Morristown, NJ, the company
    estimates that its alternative work initiative will save $2.3 million ($460,000 annually)
    over five years, with the bulk of savings coming from reduced real estate costs. Drawing
    on its internal lessons from telework, AT&amp;T is today positioned to sell more
    communications services as its business customers turn to telework to improve employee
    satisfaction and cut office costs. <br>
    <br>
    Taking a Byte Out of Carbon, which was coauthored by John Horrigan and Liz Cook,
    emphasizes that business leadership and commitment to technological advancement are
    essential to solving the climate change problem. The report concludes that as public
    policy (such as the Kyoto Protocol) or consumer preferences create incentives to use
    technology as a substitute for activities that emit carbon dioxide, the demand for these
    technologies will grow, and there will be business opportunities. <br>
    <br>
    This report is part of a series produced by WRI's Climate Protection Initiative -- a
    partnership between WRI and private firms to identify acceptable policies and business
    strategies for achieving strong climate protection goals. This institute-wide effort is
    motivated by the belief that there is a positive link between climate protection and a
    sound economy. The CPI's Electronics Leadership Project, initiated in 1997, is working
    with associations and firms to build commitment to increasing energy efficiency and
    enlarging markets for new systems of communication and transportation that will reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions. <p align="center">- 30 -</td>
