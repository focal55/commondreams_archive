- August 23 - The number of American children living in families with incomes 
below one-half of the poverty line rose to 2.7 million in 1997, up by 426,000 
from the previous year, according to an analysis of government data released today 
by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF). <br>
<br>
Moreover, the increase in children below half of the poverty line &#151; termed 
"extreme poverty" in the report &#151; was directly linked to the weakening protective 
role of cash assistance and food stamps, CDF found. One-half of the poverty line 
in 1997 was equal to $6,401 a year for a three-person family (equivalent to $123 
a week) or $8,200 a year for a family of four. The analysis differs from past 
reports because it takes into account taxes and noncash benefits such as food 
stamps, not just cash income (which includes sources such as earnings and public 
assistance). <br>
<br>
Most of the increase in children below one-half of the poverty line occurred among 
single mother families, the group most affected by recent welfare changes, CDF 
found. The number of extremely poor children in single-mother families jumped 
by 372,000 &#151; or 26 percent &#151; from 1996 to 1997, according to CDF's analyses 
of data from the Census Bureau's annual Current Population Survey. <br>
<br>
The sudden jump in extreme child poverty is especially startling because it occurred 
despite an unusually strong economy. Prior to the 1997 increase, the number of 
children living below half the poverty line had dropped for four straight years, 
the CDF analysis found. <br>
<br>
"More families have been successful in finding work, and some of these are escaping 
poverty. But more than 400,000 children have been pushed much deeper below the 
poverty line," said Deborah Weinstein, director of CDF's Family Income division. 
"For many families, increases in earnings have been outweighed by the loss of 
aid. Too often, families lose food stamps or other help that by law they should 
continue to get. These families can plunge through the holes in the safety net 
into extreme poverty." <br>
<br>
"States are not doing enough to help the worst-off families find and keep jobs. 
Food stamps, child care, training, and other work supports can lead to stable 
work, instead of deeper poverty," said Weinstein, adding that for some families 
facing multiple hurdles, still other interventions will be needed. <br>
<br>
August 22 marked the third anniversary of the welfare law signed by President 
Clinton. "When children fall into extreme poverty, they suffer significant increases 
in stunted growth, lower academic test scores, and lower earnings years later. 
States must use the funds available to them now to prevent these lifelong losses 
for children," said Weinstein. Most states have not spent all the federal welfare 
funds given to them under the 1996 welfare law. <br>
<br>
The study found a direct link between increased extreme child poverty and the 
dwindling protective role of public assistance and food stamps. In 1996, family 
income from cash assistance and food stamps kept more than 3.6 million children 
above half of the poverty line, according to the analysis. By 1997, however, these 
two programs kept less than 3 million children from extreme poverty &#151; meaning 
they protected 652,000 fewer children than the year before. Had this protective 
role merely remained constant, the number of extremely poor children would have 
<i>shrunk</i> by 226,000 in 1997, the report found, due to rising employment and 
growth in non-welfare income among the poorest families. Instead, the weakening 
of assistance allowed 426,000 more children to fall below half the poverty line. 
<br>
<br>
CDF specially noted the crucial role of food stamps. "In dollar terms, food stamp 
income didn't decline as much as cash welfare in 1997 for single mother families. 
But losing food stamps was often the final loss that tipped the family into extreme 
poverty," explained CDF analyst Arloc Sherman. "Food stamp losses are the big 
reason we found increases in extreme child poverty, while the official government 
numbers &#151; which do not count food stamps &#151; do not." Sherman noted that 
many families who lose food stamps when leaving the cash assistance rolls probably 
qualify to keep them, but may not know they remain eligible. In addition, most 
states require families to take time off from work for frequent trips to the welfare 
office to document their continuing eligibility for food stamps. These rules may 
make it impossible for working parents to get the assistance their children need. 
<br>
<br>
To make the new welfare systems safe and effective for all children, CDF recommended 
that states make sure that food stamps and health coverage reach low-income families, 
whether or not they receive cash welfare. "Outreach by public and private agencies 
can help to inform families about their eligibility for food stamps, and eligibility 
should be restored for all legal immigrant children," said Weinstein. "States 
need to change food stamp office hours and procedures to make them working parent-friendly." 
CDF also recommended expanded work supports like child care and transportation; 
effective job training; and a flexible response to severe barriers to employment, 
which include domestic violence, chronic illness, illiteracy, or pockets of high 
unemployment. "Some states have started to offer the supports families need," 
Weinstein said, "but the jump in extreme child poverty shows that, in too many 
cases, the states aren't doing nearly enough to help the neediest families." <br>
<br>
The mission of the Children's Defense Fund is to Leave No Child Behind<sup>&reg;</sup> 
and to ensure every child a Healthy Start, a Head Start, a Fair Start, a Safe 
Start, and a Moral Start in life and successful passage to adulthood with the 
help of caring families and communities. </font></font><FONT SIZE=2>
