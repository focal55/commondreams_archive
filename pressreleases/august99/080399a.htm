- August 3 - Floor Statement of Senator Paul D. Wellstone<br>
August 2, 1999<br>
<br>
Remarks on Reducing Poverty and Welfare Tracking<br>
<br>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to very briefly speak to an issue that actually 
might be an issue we will debate as we go through this Ag appropriations bill 
since part of what we deal with within the Department of Agriculture is food assistance 
programs, like the Women, Infants, and Children Program and the Food Stamp Program.<br>
<br>
We have heard from the White House and from some Members of Congress a great deal 
about the success of the welfare bill. On Sunday, the White House released data 
on the number of women who were on welfare who are now working. There will be 
a gathering in Chicago tomorrow, I believe, where the President will be talking 
about welfare to work and talking about the success of this.<br>
<br>
As a Senator, I want to raise a couple of questions that I think are important, 
and I want to focus on some unpleasant facts that we should be willing to face 
up to.<br>
<br>
First of all, I point out for my colleagues that the fact that the welfare rolls 
are down 40 percent begs the question of whether or not we have reduced poverty. 
The fact of the matter is, the welfare rolls are down 40 percent, but poverty 
is barely down. The goal was not to reduce the welfare rolls; the goal everybody 
talked about was to move families from poverty to economic independence. That 
is really what the goal was all about. The issue has never been welfare; the issue 
has been the poverty.<br>
<br>
The question is, How do you reduce the poverty? I do not quite understand how 
the White House or any Democrat or any Republican can proclaim this a success 
when we have done so little to reduce poverty in our country, especially poverty 
of children. There are about 14 million people who are poor in the country.<br>
<br>
My second point is, when the President and the White House talk about the number 
of mothers who are now working, that begs the question as to what kind of jobs 
and what kind of wages. What we should be talking about are family-wage or living-wage 
jobs. The evidence we have right now is that most of the mothers who are working 
are working in jobs with wages somewhere between about $5.50 and $7 an hour, which 
is barely above minimum wage, but does not enable these families to escape poverty.<br>
<br>
My third point is, Families USA just came out with a study that points out there 
are about 675,000 low-income citizens who have now been cut off medical assistance 
because of the welfare bill. There are about 675,000 low-income citizens who no 
longer are receiving any medical assistance.<br>
<br>
My final point is, there was a Wall Street Journal piece today about the dramatic 
precipitous decline of participation in the Food Stamp Program. I argue especially 
the decline of participation among children which cannot be explained alone by 
the state of the economy, especially with the dramatic increase in the use of 
food shelf service.<br>
<br>
What is going on? Do we have a situation now where the AFDC structure is no longer 
there, and when people come in, no one tells them about the fact they and their 
families are eligible for food stamps -- that is happening -- or they are not 
told they are eligible for medical assistance -- that is happening -- all of which 
leads me to two final things today as we move into this debate about the Agriculture 
appropriations bill.<br>
<br>
First, I lost by one vote on a welfare tracking amendment, and then the Senate 
adopted it on the Treasury-Postal bill. It is now in conference committee. The 
amendment called upon the States, when they apply for the $1 billion bonus money, 
to present to Health and Human Services the data on what kind of jobs women have, 
whether or not they and their children are participating in food stamps and do 
the families have medical assistance, so we can find out if families are better 
off or worse off. That is now in conference. If that gets taken out of conference 
committee -- amendments are adopted in the Senate and taken out in conference 
committee -- I am going to bring that amendment back up on this bill, and we are 
going to have a vote, because sometimes we do not know what we do not want to 
know, and sometimes we only know what we want to know.<br>
<br>
That is the way it is with the White House about this welfare bill. We ought to 
be engaged in an honest policy evaluation to find out what is happening in the 
country. We are talking about poor women and poor children, and we ought to know 
whether they are better off or whether they are worse off. There is some disturbing 
evidence that many of these families might, in fact, be worse off. It is a little 
early and premature for the White House to be declaring this a success or for 
any Senator or Representative, Democrat or Republican, to be declaring it a success.<br>
<br>
My final point is, since we are dealing with an Ag appropriations bill -- and 
I think I will have an amendment to this effect -- we need to call on USDA, or 
someone, to do a study and to report back to the Senate and to the Congress in 
a relatively brief period of time, as soon as possible, what is happening with 
the Food Stamp Program in this country. We need to know.<br>
<br>
There was a dramatic piece in the Washington Post about 2 weeks ago. I could hardly 
bear to read it. It was the front page of the B section. It was a picture of an 
8-year-old child, a little boy. The whole piece was devoted to hungry children 
in the District of Columbia.<br>
<br>
The gist of the article was that in August -- now -- the summer schools are going 
to shut down and the breakfasts will not be there, the School Lunch Program will 
not be there, and there is no food at home. In this particular family, this grandmother 
with four children does not have enough money to feed her children. What I want 
to know is, whatever happened to the Food Stamp Program? That has been our safety 
net program.<br>
<br>
What is going on when we have a dramatic rise in the use of food shelves in this 
country and food pantries in this country? The Catholic Church network study pointed 
this out just last month. What is going on when 675,000 low-income people are 
removed from medical assistance as a result of the welfare bill? What is going 
on when the vast majority of these women are working at jobs that still do not 
get them and their families out of poverty? What is going on when we are unwilling 
to do an honest policy evaluation of this legislation, because very soon in many 
States there will be a drop-dead date certain, and all families, all women, and 
all children will be cut off from any welfare assistance at all. Before that happens, 
we need to know what is happening with this legislation.<br>
<br>
I have come to the floor of the Senate today to basically challenge my colleagues 
to make sure this stays in the conference committee and to announce I will be 
out here on the floor with an amendment if it gets eliminated from the conference 
committee, and to announce we ought to have a study also of the Food Stamp Program 
to find out why it is not reaching children and families who need the help, and 
also to directly challenge the White House and the President. It is not enough 
to say we have cut the rolls by 40 percent. The question is, Have we reduced the 
poverty by 40 percent? We have not.<br>
<br>
It is not enough to say these mothers are now working. The question is, Are they 
working jobs that will enable them and their children to no longer be poor in 
our country? That is the goal which I do not believe has been met. We are talking 
about the lives of poor women and poor children. They deserve to be on our radar 
screen. They deserve an honest, rigorous policy evaluation so that we, as decision 
makers, know whether or not, by our actions, we are helping these women and children 
or whether or not we are hurting these women and children. We ought to have the 
courage to step up to the plate. <br>
