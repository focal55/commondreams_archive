    the workplace, people of faith will stand with workers at events and hearings in cities
    across the country on June 24. The day of action is designed to call attention to the
    fierce hostility workers face when they try to join together with co-workers to seek a
    voice for justice in the workplace.<br>
    <br>
    The National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice (NICWJ) is releasing a theological
    statement on workers' right to organize that supports the faith body statements from most
    major denominations. NICWJ also produced a responsive reading to commemorate workers
    struggles to stand together in the workplace.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;All religions believe in justice,&quot; said Bishop Jesse DeWitt, president,
    National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice and retired bishop of the United
    Methodist Church. &quot;Justice applies not only in our personal relationships, but in our
    corporate relationships as well. And a fundamental voice for justice in the workplace is a
    union. Workers deserve to have this voice without fear and harassment,&quot; continued
    Bishop DeWitt.<br>
    <br>
    Workers face increasing difficulties exercising their right to organize. Consider that:
    10,000 workers are illegally fired each year for exercising their &quot;right to
    organize&quot; -- that's one in ten workers involved in organizing campaigns is fired.<br>
    <br>
    Fifty percent of all employers threaten to eliminate all the workers' jobs if they join
    together in a union. Over 75 percent of private sector employers aggressively work against
    organizing drives by distributing anti-union literature, holding closed-door, one-on-one
    meetings with employees and hiring union-busting law firms that advise employers on how to
    pressure employers to vote against unions within the letter of the law. Workers who choose
    to go on strike because they can't reach a contract agreement can be permanently replaced.
    (Source: Kate Bronfenbrenner, Cornell University)<br>
    <br>
    Within the industrialized world, U.S. workers face the worst labor laws and the most
    hostile, anti-union business climate. Given the number of workers who get fired for
    organizing, the chilling effect it has overall on workers' organizing, and given the
    extensive delays and challenges to elections that companies routinely use to discourage
    workers from organizing, it is a clear denial of human rights in the workplace.<br>
    <br>
    According to a recent survey, nearly 50 percent of all working Americans who are not
    currently represented by unions would vote to join a union if they had the opportunity to
    do so without risking their jobs.<br>
    <br>
    The National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice (NICWJ) is a network of thirty-seven
    local interfaith committees and people of faith that educates and mobilizes the religious
    community on issues and campaigns to improve wages, benefits, working conditions for
    low-wage workers. Founded in 1996, NICWJ's Board consists of 45 nationally respected
    religious leaders, including:<br>
    <br>
    Roman Catholic Bishops Howard Hubbard (Diocese of Albany) and James Malone (retired,
    Diocese of Youngstown), Rev. Dr. Joseph Lowery (Southern Christian Leadership Conference),
    Rev. Theodore Erickson (United Church of Christ), Ms. Evely Laser Shlensky (Commission of
    Social Action of Reform Judaism), Bishop McKinley Young (African Methodist Episcopal
    Church), Mr. Khaled Saffuri (American Muslim Council)<br>

    Do Workers Have the Right to Organize?<br>
    A theological statement from the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice June 24,
    1998<br>
    <br>
    As U.S. citizens, we strongly uphold the principles of democracy. We also are supporters
    of individual rights, but recognize that our religious principles are clearer on community
    justice and community rights than they are on individual rights.<br>
    <br>
    In the Hebrew Scriptures, the Israelites organized to free themselves from their Egyptian
    slaveowners. They fought for worker rights and community rights. &quot;The Egyptians
    became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites and made their lives bitter with hard
    service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all
    the tasks that the imposed on them.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In Acts, the early Christians are described as taking care of one another to assure that
    no one had needs. &quot;All who believed were together and had all things in common; they
    would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had
    need.&quot; Later, when there were concerns that the widows were being neglected in the
    daily distribution of food, the believers were told to select seven &quot;men of good
    standing&quot; to take care of the widows' needs. The believers clearly built a
    congregation that ensured justice for all members, and they chose some of their respected
    members to serve as leaders.<br>
    <br>
    Religious principles are clear:<br>
    -- Work is sacred.<br>
    -- Workers should be treated with dignity and respect.<br>
    -- Workers should be paid fairly and on time.<br>
    -- Community members should take care of one another.<br>
    -- Leaders should be elected who are honest and have good standing in the community.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, today in the U.S., many workers give up most of their democratic,
    individual and community rights when they enter the workplace. Workers are not guaranteed
    a just wage, family benefits, family-friendly schedules, the ability to participate in
    workplace issues, the right to speak, the right to due process (most employees can be
    fired &quot;at will&quot; as long as its not for age, race, gender or disability reasons),
    nor the right to organize. The religious principles addressing work and community
    responsibility for one another are routinely ignored in some workplaces.<br>
    <br>
    One effective way that workers have achieved family wages and benefits, a voice on the
    job, fair grievance procedures, and an alternative power to managements with almost
    unlimited powers in the workplace, has been to organize unions. Although unions are not
    perfect, they have enabled millions of workers to participate more actively in workplaces.<br>
    <br>
    Most faith bodies have social teachings or denominational statements on workers' rights to
    organize. (See What Faith Groups Say about the Right to Organize, published by the
    National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice) But having solid positions and
    statements is not sufficient. Those in the religious community who are serious about
    economic justice must begin to put their principles into action. People of faith must
    support workers who seek to organize and seek to get contracts. We must challenge
    companies that fire workers who organize, intimidate workers in the workplace by holding
    mandatory anti-union meetings or badgering workers about voting against unions, stall or
    refuse to negotiate contracts, permanently replace or lock out workers.<br>
