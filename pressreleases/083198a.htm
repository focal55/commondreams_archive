    <td valign="top" width="540" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 31 - More than 61 million working women are in
    America's labor force as the nation celebrates Labor Day, 1998, according to estimates by
    the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and the Institute for Women's Policy Research
    (IWPR). Women are now 46% of the labor force and, according to CPA President and CEO Linda
    Tarr-Whelan, &quot;women are a powerful force in the current strong economy and the key to
    the nation's future economic growth.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Nationally, 59% of women aged 16 and over are in the labor force -- in full or part-time
    jobs -- and many of them are working moms. Sixty-three percent of working women have
    children under age six and 78% have children aged six to seventeen. Seventy-five percent
    of men 16 and over are in the work force. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;This Kellogg initiative has an enormous potential to amplify the experiences of
    successful community health care models and replicate them across the country,&quot; said
    CPA President and CEO Linda Tarr-Whelan. &quot;We're very excited to be able to help move
    ideas to action through this.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The percentage of working women varies from state to state. Minnesota, with just under 70%
    and Nebraska, with 68% have the highest percentages of women in the labor force; West
    Virginia, with 46% of women working has the lowest. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;CPA will provide technical assistance on policy to all 13 learning laboratories and
    serve as an information clearinghouse for the Community Voices initiative,&quot; said CPA
    Community<br>
    Voices project director Nancy Epstein. &quot;Our job is to spotlight innovative and
    successful community health care strategies.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The percentage of working women varies from state to state. Minnesota, with just under 70%
    and Nebraska, with 68% have the highest percentages of women in the labor force; West
    Virginia, with 46% of women working has the lowest. <br>
    <br>
    Women are working across the occupational landscape, as top executives, in professional
    and technical positions, in sales, service, manufacturing, farming and forestry.
    Nationally, 30% of women in the labor force hold executive, managerial or professional
    jobs. The District of Columbia, with 47%, and Maryland, with 40% are first and second in
    the nation in the percentage of women in such jobs. Indiana and Alabama, each under 25%,
    rank at the bottom. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;There's no question that women are moving up and competing successfully in all
    occupations. Unfortunately their rewards don't match their contributions by a long
    shot,&quot; says Tarr-Whelan. &quot;When women are short-changed, their families and the
    overall economy suffers.&quot; Tarr-Whelan notes that, &quot;too many women are still
    caught between the glass ceiling and the sticky floor.&quot; Women still earn less - three
    dollars for every four earned by men -- and are less likely than men to have health or
    retirement benefits. <br>
    <br>
    Those factors, according to Tarr-Whelan, in part explain the boom in businesses created
    and owned by women. More than a third of all U.S. businesses are women owned -- 8 million
    in all -- and together they provide employment for one of every four private sector
    workers and generate $2.3 trillion in sales annually. &quot;That's a powerful engine for
    the economy,&quot; says Tarr-Whelan, &quot;and it's just a part of the story. The fact is
    that women-owned firms are more likely to offer their own employees benefits that help
    working families, like flex-time and profit-sharing.&quot; <p align="center"># # #</td>
