    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 20 - In a report released today, the National
    Academy of Sciences (NAS) documented that, short of the President of the United States, no
    one person is really in charge of the safety of the nation&#146;s food supply. Today,
    food-safety responsibilities are spread between numerous Federal agencies with conflicting
    missions and responsibilities, resulting in uneven coverage and enforcement, according to
    the Academy.<br>
    <br>
    While the Academy&#146;s Committee did not come to a full consensus on the need for a
    single food-safety agency to replace the current antiquated system, the Committee report
    said, &quot;Many members of the Committee are of the view that the most viable means of
    achieving these goals would be to create a single, unified agency headed by a single
    administrator.&quot; Currently, at least 12 Federal agencies implement 35 food-safety
    statutes.<br>
    <br>
    The Committee did call for the appointment of an &quot;identifiable, high-ranking,
    presidentially-appointed head, who would direct and coordinate federal activities and
    speak to the nation, giving federal food safety efforts a single voice.&quot; However, the
    report said that it is critical the person should have both legal authority and budgetary
    control for food safety, and therefore it did not back the creation of a White House-based
    food-safety &#145;czar.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The National Academy of Sciences has provided the strongest evidence yet of the
    weakness of the current food-safety system,&quot; said Caroline Smith DeWaal, CSPI&#146;s
    food safety director. &quot;With new food-safety hazards on the horizon, it is urgent that
    the White House and Congress move quickly to implement the recommendations in the report
    and to fully fund the agencies currently responsible for food safety.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The National Academy of Sciences stressed the need for better science and clearer
    statutory mandates in conjunction with a more streamlined system to correct the current
    deficiencies. The report said that the current legal structure for food safety is based on
    laws that are &quot;inconsistent, uneven, and at times archaic.&quot; It said these laws
    &quot;inhibit use of science-based decision-making.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The current statutes have been developed since the beginning of the century but have never
    been comprehensively updated to address changing conditions. Other countries are also
    developing more unified food-safety systems, including Canada and the United Kingdom.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The US can no longer afford a system that works better for Washington power brokers
    and bureaucrats than it does for American consumers,&quot; said DeWaal. &quot;Hopefully,
    the NAS study will show Congress how urgent the problems have become.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Representative Vic Fazio (D-CA) was the major proponent of funding for the NAS study,
    Ensuring Food Safety From Farm to Table, with the support of the Center for Science in the
    Public Interest. In addition, Representative Fazio and Senators Durbin (D-IL) and
    Torricelli (D-NJ) have sponsored legislation, the Safe Food Act (S. 1465, HR 2801), which
    would create the Federal Food Safety Administration, an independent agency that will
    consolidate and streamline the food-safety functions of the Federal government. CSPI
    coordinates the Recipe for Safe Food, which supports the Food Safety Enforcement
    Enhancement Acts (S. 1264, HR 3070), the Safety of Imported Foods Act (HR 3052), the
    Imported Food Safety Act (HR 4080), and the Consumer Food Safety Act (HR 3676).<p align="center">###</p>
    <p>The Center for Science in the Public Interest is a nonprofit health-advocacy
    organization founded in 1971. CSPI is supported largely by the one million subscribers to
    its Nutrition Action Healthletter. Earlier this year, CSPI released a report,
    &quot;Protecting the Crown Jewels of Medicine: a strategic plan to preserve the
    effectiveness of antibiotics,&quot; which recommended policy initiatives to reduce
    unnecessary antibiotic uses on farms and in human medicine. </td>
