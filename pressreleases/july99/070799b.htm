- July 7 - The Russian nuclear agency Minatom and the Non-Proliferation Trust 
(NPT), a private U.S. non-profit entity, have signed an agreement clearing the 
way for development work to start on a 6000-ton dry storage facility for spent 
fuel imported into Russia. Necessary approvals still must be obtained from the 
U.S. and Russian governments, and each side is to finance its own activities. 
The Non-Proliferation Trust is an outgrowth of U.S. Fuels and Security, which 
was formed to develop an international spent fuel storage facility on Wake Island 
in the Pacific. Its principals include Admiral Daniel Murphy, a former chief of 
staff to President Bush; former CIA director William Webster; retired Admiral 
Bruce Demars, a former chief of the Navy’s reactor program; and entrepreneur Alex 
Copson. 
<P><font size="2">But in an unlikely alliance, the project also is being advised 
and promoted by Thomas Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. 
environmental and non-proliferation organization. According to officials of Russian 
environmental groups that visited the U.S. this Spring, Cochran said he believes 
the project would help secure Russian plutonium.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">"This project is a violation of several Russian laws which ban 
the import of high-level waste into</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Russia," said Vladimir Slivyak of the Socio-Ecological Union, 
an umbrella organization composed of some 300 groups across the former Soviet 
Union. "Russian environmental groups are shocked by the NPT and NRDC activity 
which has nothing in common with environmental principles and unethically promotes 
the interest of the western nuclear industry, whose main concern is to get rid 
of its own nuclear waste."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&quot;The world has huge problems with its radioactive waste, 
but sending it to Russia is not the answer,&quot; said Michael Mariotte, executive 
director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS), a Washington-based 
international environmental group. &quot;While we are sympathetic to NRDC’s proliferation 
concerns, this plan really represents the ultimate in ‘not in my backyard’ thinking. 
The only real beneficiaries of this scheme are nuclear utilities and the NPT personnel.&quot; 
</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Under the NPT proposal, the organization would import commercial 
irradiated fuel containing up to 50 tons of fissile plutonium and store it in 
dry casks. The fuel could come from many countries, especially in western Europe. 
The NPT organization would collect fees from the utilities and nations exporting 
the fuel. At the same time, the NPT would use some of its fees to lease up to 
50 tons of weapons plutonium from Minatom and store it at a facility currently 
under construction at Mayak. Although the NPT is being characterized as a non-profit 
entity, the principals are experienced at for-profit enterprises and presumably 
will receive business-level compensation.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Reprocessing of the fuel reportedly would be prohibited under 
the agreement between the NPT and Minatom. But Slivyak expressed doubt that Minatom 
would honor any such commitment. &quot;Minatom several times has stated it intends 
to reprocess the foreign spent fuel,&quot; said Slivyak. Plutonium extracted through 
reprocessing can be used for nuclear weapon production and also in the MOX program 
of Russia. This program includes using the old, dangerous Soviet-designed reactors 
and reprocessing facilities. Russia's greatest nuclear catastrophe happened at 
the Mayak plutonium producing facility in 1957. The Mayak complex also will be 
used for Russia's MOX fuel program, which would use plutonium from warheads and 
reprocessing as fuel for commercial nuclear power reactors.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&quot;Mayak causes many safety concerns among the Russian public, 
who do not trust Minatom, which is responsible for the site,&quot; explained Slivyak. 
&quot;Moreover,&quot; he added, &quot;Russian environmental and peace groups argue 
that if Minatom cannot meet legislative requirements even at the stage of signing 
an agreement, there is no hope the agency will protect the environment and public 
health and safety in the vastly more complex and difficult MOX program. The Russian 
Minatom and the U.S.-based NPT must respect the nation’s environmental laws and 
step away from this agreement.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Earlier this year NIRS released a letter from Minatom chief 
Yevgeney Adamov to U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, in which Adamov proposed 
that the U.S. solve its high-level waste problem by shipping its irradiated fuel 
to Minatom, which would then reprocess it. Richardson reportedly declined the 
offer.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">NPT says the large sum of money it will provide to Minatom if 
it accepts the foreign high-level nuclear waste will allow safety improvements 
at Russian nuclear facilities. "The world’s nuclear industry, through NPT, is 
just searching for an opportunity to solve the problem with waste by organizing 
a worldwide nuclear dump site in Russia," said Slivyak. "Sending of nuclear garbage 
from other countries to Russia will never improve safety, but will contribute 
to Minatom's policy of nuclear genocide against the Russian population. If the 
U.S. administration goes along with NPT's plan, the genocide will become international."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">U.S. law prohibits the shipping of U.S.-origin irradiated fuel 
to nations that do not have an Agreement for Cooperation with the U.S. Russia 
does not have such an agreement with the U.S. More than ½ the fuel in the world 
is classified as of U.S. origin, and thus would be prohibited by U.S. from being 
sent to Russia, unless an Agreement of Cooperation were drafted and signed or 
a presidential waiver granted. &quot;We call on President Clinton and Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson to quickly and adamantly reject this scheme,&quot; said Mariotte. 
&quot;Sending 6,000 tons of lethal irradiated fuel, including 50 tons of fissile 
plutonium, across the world to central Russia is the most hazardous and incomprehensible 
atomic waste transport program yet contemplated,&quot; added Mariotte. &quot;The 
nuclear industry has to get one thing clear: it is responsible for its own nuclear 
garbage and the world’s environmental movement will actively oppose any scheme 
to dump the industry’s waste on other peoples.&quot;</font></P>
