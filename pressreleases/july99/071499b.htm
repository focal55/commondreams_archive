<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- July 14 - The following was released today by the NonProfit Accountability Project: 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is a beltway cliche that 
special interests and big money subvert the political process. A report from the 
NonProfit Accountability Project suggests that a corruptive transformation has 
also taken place at the Environmental Defense Fund under the leadership of executive 
director Fred Krupp. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Environmental Defense 
Fund (EDF) is a leading supporter of Sen. Chafee's Credit for Voluntary Early 
Action bill (S. 547) which provides potentially lucrative credits for activities 
alleged to mitigate global warming. Currently, Reps. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) and Calvin 
Dooley (D-Calif.) are preparing to introduce a House version of the bill. Meanwhile 
many other environmental organizations as different as Greenpeace and Natural 
Resources Defense Council have opposed the Chafee bill; furthermore, several groups 
including the National Environmental Trust, Ozone Action, and Sierra Club have 
criticized the bill for "critical flaws" and "gaping loopholes" that will favor 
large electric utilities and other big corporations making "dubious" efforts to 
address climate change. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NonProfit Accountability 
Project's new report based to a great extent on leaked documents reveals that 
in EDF's support for the "early action" bill, EDF is engaged in self-dealing actions 
with conflict of interest written all over them. EDF created a nonprofit the Environmental 
Resources Trust (ERT) in 1997 and has provided funding, staffing and insurance 
for ERT; furthermore, three of ERT's seven board members are top-level EDF staffers. 
Administrative documents of ERT reveal negotiations for ERT to contract with the 
Edison Electric Institute and affiliated electric utilities for validation and 
management of the "early action" credits that would be created by the Chafee bill. 
Result: ERT profits from the policy advanced by the "early action" bill for which 
EDF is a leading supporter. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, EDF's project 
ERT would profit from controversial "flexibility mechanisms" -- emissions trading 
and carbon sequestration -- strategies viewed as loopholes and opposed by many 
environmentalists around the globe. Debate over these mechanisms has contributed 
to a logjam at recent climate negotiations. It is problematic to say the least 
that EDF through its affiliate ERT has developed a financial stake in these disputed 
"mechanisms." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ERT is chaired by C. Boyden 
Gray, a longtime opponent of global warming treaties and of environmentalists. 
Additionally, Mr. Gray chairs Citizens for a Sound Economy which has pressured 
Congress not to support the Kyoto Treaty, leading to the deadlocked situation 
that ironically EDF is trying to break with the "early action" bill. Also he has 
recently been a lobbyist for an electric utility that will benefit from the Chafee 
bill. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering Gray's record 
and his close ties to the corporate sector, questions arise regarding the integrity 
of ERT to act as an accrediting agency for greenhouse emission credits given to 
corporations. Furthermore, Gray's association with EDF's "early action" scheme 
suggests that the policy is but a "smoke and mirrors" effort to earn corporations 
and politicians "brownie points" for the semblance of addressing global warming. 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other internal documents 
raise more questions regarding the agenda and integrity of EDF and ERT. These 
include: </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Plans to profit from 
"carbon sequestration" marketing</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- planting trees and protecting 
forests</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- controversial and questionably 
effective but business friendly responses to the climate crisis.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Negotiations to give 
potentially valuable greenhouse credits to a nuclear utility fell through in part 
because of the unreliability of the company's nuclear generating capacity. This 
lends credence to many environmentalists' view that the Chafee bill is geared 
to "throw a lifeline to the nuclear industry."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- The stated intent in 
ERT's contract with Niagara Mohawk to hide from public and media scrutiny the 
details of the contract.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- EDF's support for a 
multibillion dollar taxpayer bailout of so-called "stranded costs" of Edison International's 
nuclear reactors; meanwhile, EDF's affiliate ERT simultaneously pursued a closed-door 
deal to benefit financially from marketing Edison's "green energy." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A failed EDF/ERT effort 
to legitimize a self-chilling beverage can that released a potent greenhouse aerosol. 
The use of just one can would have been comparable to the emissions from driving 
200 miles by automobile. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The possibility that 
EDF/ERT's activities may circumvent laws governing nonprofits, evident from the 
stated concern a an internal memo that ERT's activities might draw critical attention 
from state attorneys general. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In EDF's advocacy of the 
"early action" bill, there are also conflict of interest issues in relation to 
EDF's elite trustees. EDF's board abounds with super-rich people, top executives 
of financial services firms, corporate lawyers, and public interest figures themselves 
beholden to special interests -- all with a financial interest in limiting the 
cost incurred by the corporate sector to address global warming. This report examines 
four EDF trustees who exemplify the above archetypes. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- John H.T. Wilson, EDF's 
chair, is advisory director of Morgan Stanley, a firm that provides financial 
services for and holds major investments in oil and auto companies, as well as 
several hundred million in stocks of the electric utilities for which the Chafee 
bill would be a financial windfall. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- James W.B. Benkard is 
a partner with the global corporate law firm Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell. He and 
his firm represent polluting corporations such as Exxon which would be interested 
in a global warming bill full of "critical flaws" and "gaping loopholes." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Frank E. Taplin Jr. is 
a major stockholder and former director of the North American Coal Company (a.k.a. 
NACCO Industries), founded and predominantly directed and owned by his family, 
vesting him with a strong interest in watered-down global warming policy. NACCO 
has a problematic record on environmental matters which makes Taplin's presence 
on EDF's board all the more questionable to say the least. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- EDF Trustee Gene Likens, 
a scientist known as "the father of acid rain," heads a group the Institute of 
Ecosystem Studies that has been funded by an electric utility that will benefit 
from the Chafee bill. The President of the utility also acts as a trustee of the 
Institute. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also notes that 
the financial interests of EDF trustees benefit from EDF's policy stances on free 
trade, utility deregulation, and clean air that have been criticized by other 
environmentalists. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further casting doubt upon 
EDF's independence, the report describes that there exists a revolving door between 
EDF and the U.S. presidential administrations, both current and past. Also, recently 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted EDF $175,000 to promote to the 
public the controversial strategy of greenhouse gas emissions trading, a policy 
from which EDF's affiliate ERT will profit and by which politicians and corporations 
may appease environmental pressure to act on global warming. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Symbolic of the overall 
questionable nature of EDF's global warming advocacy, EDF is endorsed by the Global 
Climate Coalition (GCC), a leading lobby opposed to addressing global warming. 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the market-based 
components of the Clean Air Act of 1990 -- which EDF crafted and supported -- 
provide the basis for the carbon trading program of the Chafee bill. Yet the 1990 
Clean Air Act has proven quite inadequate in addressing air pollution and EDF's 
market mechanisms have had problems. The public should be skeptical of EDF's advice 
on climate change, especially in light of extensive opposition from environmentalists 
and the plethora of conflict of interest issues as detailed by this report. </font>
