- July 20 - Parents of children who died in adult jails expressed outrage today 
at H.R.1501, legislation pending in Congress that would eliminate protections 
for children from physical and sexual abuse in correctional facilities. Sen. Paul 
Wellstone (D. Minn.) is offering legislation that would preserve the protections. 
<br>
<br>
"After what happened to my son, I can't believe that Congress would be so uncaring," 
said Rita Horn, whose 15-year-old son Robbie committed suicide in a county jail 
in LaGrange, Kentucky. "Without the legal system stopping kids from being held 
in the jail, Robbie's death could be repeated again and again."<br>
<br>
Following her son's death, Horn sued to stop Oldham County from holding children 
in the local jail. Jails records showed that 1,390 children had been held over 
a 4-year period, most for minor violations and "status" offenses like truancy 
and curfew violations. The lawsuit resulted in a consent decree in 1985 in which 
county officials agreed to no longer hold children in the jail.<br>
<br>
However, under a provision sponsored by Rep. Tom DeLay (R-22nd TX) amending the 
Prison Litigation Reform Act, all consent decrees which were in effect on the 
date the original Act was passed in 1995 would automatically be terminated. Under 
the DeLay amendment, which passed with only ten minutes of floor debate and was 
not addressed at all during Judiciary Committee hearings, children could again 
be held in the Kentucky jail where Robbie Horn died.<br>
<br>
To counter the DeLay provision, Sen. Paul Wellstone is offering legislation that 
would exempt children and those with mental illness from the Prison Litigation 
Reform Act. Wellstone's legislation would insure that consent decrees protecting 
children from harmful practices remains in place. "We must insure that when a 
child is incarcerated in the United States, the child is safe and the facility 
meets minimum constitutional standards," said Senator Wellstone in offering his 
amendment. "No society can call itself civilized which turns a blind eye to the 
plight of children like Robbie Horn and Chris Peterman."<br>
<br>
"The DeLay provisions would immediately wipe out protections in scores of counties 
around America where children have been abused and mistreated in adult jails and 
juvenile facilities," said Mark Soler, president of the Youth Law Center, a public 
interest law office that has represented children over the past twenty years. 
"Thousands of children could again be locked up under dangerous, often horrific 
conditions."<br>
<br>
Over the past two decades, Robbie Horn's case has not been the only tragedy. In 
Ironton, Ohio, a 15-year-old girl ran away from home overnight, then returned 
to her parents, but was put in the county jail by the juvenile court judge "to 
teach her a lesson." On the fourth night of her confinement, she was sexually 
assaulted by a deputy jailer. More than 500 children had been incarcerated in 
the jail over the previous three years, most for skipping school and other minor 
offenses. Since county officials entered into a consent decree more than 15 years 
ago, no children have been held in the jail.<br>
<br>
Not all consent decrees involve adult jails. In Philadelphia, children in the 
juvenile detention facility were regularly beaten by staff, often with paddles, 
chains, or other objects. In Portland, Oregon, the juvenile facility was acknowledged 
by local officials to be unsafe, unsanitary, a fire hazard, and "reeking of urine." 
In Solano County, California, children were put in isolation for days at a time, 
with no access to showers, exercise, recreation, or medical staff. All of these 
practices were ended through consent decrees with local officials.<br>
<br>
Other cases have involved state facilities. In South Carolina, nine children in 
the state correctional facility who had attempted suicide were transferred to 
the state mental hospital. There each child was subjected to long periods of solitary 
confinement. Several of the children were also placed, naked or in paper gowns, 
in four-point restraints, hands and feet bound to the four corners of their beds. 
State doctors forcibly injected several of the children with vitamins or psychotropic 
drugs as part of "aversive therapy." In Oklahoma, children in the state institutions 
were regularly beaten by staff. In Arizona, children in the state correctional 
facilities were put in solitary confinement, handcuffed, or put in four-point 
restraints. In California, disabled children did not receive special education 
services. Again, all of these practices stopped when public officials entered 
into consent decrees.<br>
<br>
All of these consent decrees -- in cases involving adult jails, juvenile detention 
facilities, and state correctional institutions -- would immediately be dissolved 
if the DeLay provision in H.R. 1501 becomes law.<br>
<br>
"When my son Chris was beaten and killed in the Boise jail, I swore his death 
would not be in vain," said Janice Peterman, whose 17-year-old son was jailed 
for failing to pay $73 in traffic fines. Over a 14-hour period, Chris Peterman 
was tortured and finally murdered by other prisoners in the cell. More than 650 
children had been held in the jail over a 3-year period, 42% for traffic offenses 
and 17% for "status" offenses. In response to a class action lawsuit, local officials 
agreed to end incarceration of children in the jail. Mrs. Peterman said, "I turned 
my grieving for my son into work to protect other children from tragedy. This 
would rob my work of meaning, and turn today's children into victims just like 
Chris."<br>
<br>
"If the DeLay amendment passes, it will eliminate an important weapon to stop 
the kinds of atrocities experienced by Chris Peterman and Robbie Horn," stated 
Vincent Schiraldi, Director of the Justice Policy Institute. "Our research shows 
that youth in adult facilities are five times more likely to be sexually assaulted 
and eight times more likely to commit suicide than youths held in juvenile facilities."<br>
