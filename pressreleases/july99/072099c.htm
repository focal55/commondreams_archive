<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- July 20 - An overwhelming majority of American voters want the U.S. Senate to 
approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), according to a new, bipartisan 
opinion survey. The CTBT will ban all nuclear test explosions and help prevent 
nations from making new and more deadly types of nuclear weapons. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked if the United 
States should approve or disapprove of a treaty which would prohibit nuclear weapons 
test explosions worldwide, over eight in 10 Americans (82 percent) want the Treaty 
approved. Indeed, more than 7 in 10 Americans (71 percent) support Treaty ratification 
strongly. Only 14 percent say the Treaty should not be approved. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An overwhelming majority 
of self-identified Republicans (80 percent) and Democrats (86 percent) support 
approval of the Treaty. Indeed even conservative Republicans (79 percent) support 
the Treaty overwhelmingly. Support for approval of the CTBT cuts across every 
demographic group. And support for the Test Ban Treaty has grown since India and 
Pakistan's nuclear blasts, when support for the Treaty was at 73 percent (The 
Mellman Group, May 1998). </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These results are based 
on the findings of an opinion survey of 1,000 adults conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide, 
a Republican polling firm, and a Democratic firm, The Mellman Group, from June 
18-21. (The statistical margin of error is plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. 
The margin of error for subgroups is larger.) </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Test Ban Treaty was 
transmitted to the Senate for its approval over a year-and-a-half ago, but Foreign 
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has so far blocked its consideration, 
not even allowing a hearing on the Treaty in his Committee. It must be ratified 
by the U.S. and other key states before it enters into force. President Clinton 
has repeatedly stated that ratifying the Treaty is the best way to protect U.S. 
security andreduce the spread of nuclear weapons. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, nine Senators called 
for prompt action on the CTBT. At a press briefing on the CTBT on the polling 
data in the Capitol, Democratic and Republican Senators Daschle, Biden, Specter, 
Levin, Jeffords, Kerrey, Bingaman, Murray, and Dorgan called on Senator Helms 
to hold hearings and to report the Treaty to the Senate for consideration before 
an international conference to accelerate the Treaty's entry into force this October. 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CTBT was signed by President 
Clinton and the leaders of Britain, France, China and Russia in September 1996. 
To date, 152 nations have signed and 41 have also ratified. However, the Treaty 
will not take effect until the United States and other key countries ratify the 
pact. A majority of Senators have called for a vote on the CTBT. Treaty experts 
expect it would win the two-thirds majority needed for Senate approval if a vote 
is allowed. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Theft of Nuclear Secrets 
is Seen as Further Evidence for CTBT Ratification: </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent reports of possible 
Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear weapons secrets may be one factor that has increased 
support for U.S. ratification of the CTBT. A plurality of Americans say these 
reports underscore the need for a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Forty-eight percent 
(48 percent) agree that "one important way to help prevent China from improving 
its nuclear arsenal is for the United States to <br>
ratify and help encourage global implementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty which China has also signed and that this Treaty will prevent China from 
testing new bomb designs to see if they work." Meanwhile, only 17 percent say 
that, in light of China obtaining U.S. nuclear secrets," it is irrelevant for 
the U.S. to ratify and encourage global implementation of the CTBT because this 
Treaty will not stop China from improving their nuclear technology and developing 
new weapons." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support Cuts Across All 
Regions: </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support is also consistent 
and overwhelming across all regions of the country, with 84 percent of those living 
in the Northeast, 80 percent of those in the Midwest, 84 percent of those in the 
South and 77 percent of those in the West favoring Senate approval of the Treaty. 
These high levels of support are similar to those in individual states across 
the nation. In no state surveyed does support from Republican, Democratic, or 
independent voters drop below 70 percent. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans are united (84 
percent) in believing that an international treaty Prohibiting all nuclear test 
explosions is a better way for the United States to protect itself from nuclear 
threats posed by other countries than is resuming nuclear test explosions. Only 
11 percent think resuming nuclear testing is a better way to protect the United 
States. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Senate's failure to 
consider the CTBT undermines efforts to protect the U.S. from nuclear proliferation 
and the possibility of nuclear war," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of 
the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers. "Americans clearly want their Senators 
and the President to work together to ratify and implement the CTBT to help make 
the world safer for future generations," he said. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The CTBT will improve our 
nation's ability to detect, inspect, and deter nuclear test explosions, thereby 
helping to block the development of new bomb types by countries like China. By 
failing to consider and approve the CTBT the Senate leaves the door open to nuclear 
proliferation and renewed nuclear arms races," added Kimball. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans Prefer a Senate 
Candidate Who Supports the CTBT: </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When given the choice between 
one hypothetical candidate who supports the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and 
another who opposes the Treaty, Americans prefer the candidate who supports the 
Treaty by a two-to-one margin. Sixty-two percent (62 percent) say they would vote 
for the candidate for U.S. Senate who supports the Treaty, while fewer than a 
third (31 percent) would choose a candidate who opposes the Treaty. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Candidate A (Supports 
CTBT): "The U.S. Senate should ratify the almost three years ago and we should 
honor our promise to the other countries that have signed. Many other countries 
will not implement this Treaty unless we do, and unless we lead the way to ratify 
and help implement the Treaty, countries without nuclear weapons will continue 
their efforts to develop them. Even underground explosions have released radioactive 
gas and we have a responsibility to future generations to make the world safer 
and to end the environmental damage caused by nuclear testing." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Candidate B (Opposes 
CTBT): "The U.S. Senate should not ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because 
the Treaty does not stop other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons and because 
we cannot be sure other countries are living up to the Treaty. If the United States 
ratifies this Treaty, we will be obligated to commit millions of dollars to implement 
it when it cannot be effectively verified. Countries like China and Iran can always 
conduct nuclear tests in secret, meanwhile we will no longer be able to test our 
own nuclear arsenal to make sure our existing weapons work and will continue to 
serve as an effective deterrent to other nations." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Senate candidate who supports 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is preferred by every demographic subgroup of 
voters. Indeed this issue pushes partisanship aside with majorities of both parties' 
voters (58 percent of Republicans, 66 percent of Democrats) stating a preference 
for a candidate who will support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What is striking about 
the results of the national survey is the overwhelming nature of support for the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty," commented pollster Michael Dabadie of Wirthlin 
Worldwide. "Indeed, far from being a partisan issue, support for the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty comes from all sides of the political and ideological spectrum," 
he said. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------ <br>
The Coalition is a non-partisan alliance of 17 of the nation's leading arms control 
and non-proliferation organizations working for a practical, step-by-step program 
to reduce nuclear dangers and prevent new threats from emerging.<br>
