    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 8 - As the U.S. Senate returns from the July 4 recess,
    a new scorecard on the McCain anti-tobacco bill shows which Senators voted to protect kids
    from tobacco addiction and which Senators failed to declare their independence from the
    tobacco industry. According to an analysis of voting records and campaign contributions
    conducted by the CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS, Senators who voted consistently against
    the McCain bill took far more money from the tobacco industry than those who supported the
    bill.<br>
    <br>
    The CAMPAIGN today released a scorecard showing each Senator's voting performance on key
    McCain bill votes, and the total tobacco industry campaign contributions each received
    over the last decade and in their last election cycles.<br>
    <br>
    The McCain bill is a comprehensive approach to tobacco control that was put aside by the
    Senate on June 17, when it fell three votes short of the 60 needed for cloture -- to cut
    off extended debate. Opponents thus prevented a vote on the bill on its merits. The bill
    would have imposed restrictions on youth access to tobacco, curtailed advertising that has
    the greatest influence on kids, created a public education campaign, raised the price of
    cigarettes to discourage tobacco use among children, confirmed the authority of the FDA to
    regulate tobacco, and more. The McCain bill, or other tobacco legislation, could still be
    considered during the remainder of this congressional session.<br>
    <br>
    The CAMPAIGN's scorecard assigns each Senator a &quot;Pro-Kid&quot; score based on the
    critical cloture vote and the other McCain bill votes while the bill was being debated on
    the floor of the Senate, and provides figures on the tobacco campaign contributions each
    legislator received. The tobacco industry opposed the McCain bill and fought hard to
    defeat it.<br>
    <br>
    Senators who consistently voted against kids on proposed amendments to the bill, and more
    importantly, who worked to kill the legislation altogether by voting against cloture, took
    an average of more than four times the amount of campaign contributions from tobacco
    interests than those receiving strong Pro-Kid scores.<br>
    <br>
    Fifty Senators received Pro-Kid scores of 67 or better, with 19 of them supporting Pro-Kid
    votes 100 percent of the time. Those who voted Pro-Kid 100 percent of the time were
    Senators Boxer (CA), Durbin (IL), Moseley-Braun (IL), Kennedy (MA), Sarbanes (MD),
    Wellstone (MN), Baucus (MT), Conrad (ND), Dorgan (ND), Lautenberg (NJ), Bingaman (NM),
    Bryan (NV), Moynihan (NY), Wyden (OR), Specter (PA), Reed (RI), Johnson (SD), Leahy (VT)
    and Murray (WA). (Senator Specter's score of 100 was based on his Pro-Kid positions on the
    scorecard's first three votes, which took place before he became ill and was unable to
    vote on the others.)<br>
    <br>
    The following 31 additional Senators received a score of 67 or more and voted in favor of
    cloture: Bumpers (AR), Feinstein (CA), Dodd (CT), Lieberman (CT), Biden (DE), Graham (FL),
    Cleland (GA), Inouye (HI), Akaka (HI), Grassley (IA), Harkin (IA), Breaux (LA), Landrieu
    (LA), Kerry (MA), Mikulski (MD), Collins (ME), Snowe (ME), Levin (MI), Kerrey (NE),
    Torricelli (NJ), Reid (NV), D'Amato (NY), Glenn (OH), Smith (OR), Chafee (RI), Daschle
    (SD), Jeffords (VT), Feingold (WI), Kohl (WI), Byrd (WV) and Rockefeller (WV).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Nineteen Senators stood up to the tobacco industry and consistently voted for
    America's kids, and 50 Senators received passing scores in their votes against Big
    Tobacco,&quot; said Bill Novelli, CAMPAIGN president. &quot;Although the McCain bill did
    not pass, these Senators' courage and independence have paved the way for strong
    legislation to again be brought forward in this session of Congress to save lives and
    protect kids from tobacco addiction.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In contrast, 43 Senators who voted consistently with the industry's positions received
    scores of 33 or below. An examination of campaign contributions revealed Senators with
    scores of 33 or below took an average of four times more tobacco industry money than those
    with strong Pro-Kid voting records. For the period from January 1, 1987 through the first
    quarter of 1998, the average tobacco campaign contribution for Senators scoring 33 or
    below on the McCain bill was $34,083, while Senators who scored 67 and above only accepted
    $8,108. Further, in their most recent election cycle, these Senators with scores of 33 or
    below received an average of $17,509 in tobacco campaign contributions, versus an average
    of $3,960 for their Pro-Kid, high-scoring colleagues.<br>
    <br>
    Of the 43 Senators with scores of 33 or below, 22 received scores of 14 or less (one or
    zero Pro-Kid votes), and not one of these 22 Senators voted in favor of cloture. Senators
    with Pro-Kid scores of 14 or less were Senators Stevens (AK), Sessions (AL), Kyl (AZ),
    Allard (CO), Coats (IN), McConnell (KY), Lott (MS), Cochran (MS), Burns (MT), Faircloth
    (NC), Helms (NC), Hagel (NE), Smith (NH), Nickles (OK), Thurmond (SC), Thompson (TN),
    Hutchison (TX), Hatch (UT), Warner (VA), Gorton (WA), Enzi (WY) and Thomas (WY).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Many of these Senators with poor Pro-Kid scores are so clearly indebted to the
    tobacco industry for its political contributions, that they did everything in their power
    to defeat tobacco control legislation,&quot; said Matthew L. Myers, executive vice
    president and general counsel of the CAMPAIGN. &quot;These Senators were intent on killing
    this strong legislation, rather than working cooperatively to pass the best possible bill.
    Not one of them introduced an amendment to improve the bill. In opposing this bipartisan
    legislation, they ultimately opposed an effort that would have saved lives from
    tobacco.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    While the tobacco industry's millions of dollars in political contributions helped to
    narrowly defeat the McCain bill, the opportunity for meaningful action remains alive.
    &quot;Now that the Senate has returned from the July 4 recess, it is critical that
    legislators move forward quickly on tobacco legislation,&quot; said Myers. &quot;There is
    clearly enough time left to get it done this year, and we look forward to the continued
    support of the Pro-Kid Senators. We also encourage those Senators who did not receive
    passing Pro-Kid scores to declare their independence from tobacco money and join us in
    working for comprehensive legislation to protect kids and save lives.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The scorecard is based on eight key votes, including efforts to raise the price of
    tobacco, protect funding for critical public health programs, and most importantly, end
    debate and move the bill forward. Had it received the necessary 60 votes, the cloture
    motion taken on June 17 would have advanced the McCain bill, and signaled strong support
    for final passage. Because this vote stands out as the most important of the debate, it
    counts double in the scorecard. A copy of the scorecard follows. The campaign contribution
    data were compiled by Common Cause using Federal Election Commission reports. The CAMPAIGN
    will continue to monitor and make the public aware of important tobacco control votes in
    Congress.<br>
    <br>
    The Washington, DC-based CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS is the largest initiative ever
    undertaken to decrease youth tobacco use in the United States. Its mandate is to focus the
    nation's attention and action on keeping tobacco marketing from seducing children, and
    making tobacco less accessible to kids.<br>

    SENATE TOBACCO VOTE CHART: Pro-Kid vs. Pro-Tobacco<br>
    <br>
    CHART EXPLANATION: The following chart lists all U.S. Senators<br>
    by state, giving them a &quot;Pro-Kid&quot; score based on a series of votes<br>
    on the McCain tobacco control bill (S. 1415). The Pro-Kid score is<br>
    the proportion of votes cast that are Pro-Kid with 100 percent<br>
    being the strongest possible Pro-Kid score. Explanations for each<br>
    vote follow the chart. Using data released in June of 1998, the<br>
    chart also lists the amount of tobacco industry PAC money that each<br>
    Senator has taken both during their last election cycle, and since<br>
    January 1, 1987.<br>

    NOTES<br>
    (a): Tobacco PAC money returned by these Senators was deducted<br>
    from their &quot;Tobacco $ 1987-1998&quot; column totals.<br>
    --<br>
    (b) VOTE EXPLANATIONS:<br>
    Vote 1: Table Kennedy Amendment. Pro-Kid vote was NO. This<br>
    amendment would have raised the price increase from $1.10 to $1.50<br>
    per pack. The motion to table passed 59-39.<br>
    Vote 2: Table Ashcroft Amendment. Pro-Kid vote was YES.<br>
    This amendment would have eliminated the revenue measures from the<br>
    underlying bill. The motion to table passed 72-26.<br>
    Vote 3: Table Gregg Amendment. Pro-Kid vote was NO. This<br>
    amendment removed the $8 billion per year cap and all other civil<br>
    liability provisions from the bill. The motion to table failed<br>
    37-61.<br>
    Vote 4: Table Durbin-DeWine. Pro-Kid vote was NO. This<br>
    amendment shifted the focus of the &quot;lookback&quot; penalties from<br>
    industry-wide to company specific. The motion to table failed 29-66.<br>
    Vote 5: Pass Coverdell Amendment. Pro-Kid vote was NO. This<br>
    amendment funded anti-illegal-drug enforcement and interdiction.<br>
    All funds for these programs were authorized to be taken from the<br>
    public health account created by S. 1415. The amendment passed<br>
    52-46.<br>
    Vote 6: Table Gramm Amendment. Pro-Kid vote was YES. This<br>
    amendment provided a reduction in the so-called &quot;marriage-tax.&quot;<br>
    Funds for this would be taken from the public health account created<br>
    by S. 1415, as well as the other accounts, such as for health<br>
    research, farmers, and state reimbursement. The motion to table<br>
    failed 48-50.<br>
    Vote 7/8: Cloture Motion -- Because of importance, this vote<br>
    counts twice. Pro-Kid vote was YES. This final cloture motion<br>
    would have moved S. 1415 to a final vote on passage. The cloture<br>
    motion failed 57-42. (60 votes needed to invoke cloture.)<br>
    Vote 9: Motion to Waive Budget Point of Order. Pro-Kid vote<br>
    was YES. This point of order removed S. 1415 from the Senate floor<br>
    and sent it back to the Commerce Committee. The motion to waive<br>
    the point or order failed 53-46 (60 votes needed to waive motion).<p align="center">-0-</td>
