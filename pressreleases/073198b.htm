    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 31 - The White House has again demonstrated that it
    does not have a meaningful plan for reducing global warming gases, even as it acknowledges
    that those gases are leading to catastrophic climate change, Greenpeace said today. The
    environmental group&#146;s comments came in response to the release tod of the latest
    analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) on the cost of implementing
    the Kyoto climate treaty. <p>&quot;While President Clinton and Vice President Gore travel
    the country enumerating the climatic disasters of the past year, they continue to put
    forward a policy that is all talk and no action,&quot; said Greenpeace&#146;s Gary Cook. </p>
    <p>Cook said the CEA approach is flawed because it is based not on any concrete plans to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home, but relies instead on &#147;hot air&#148; paper
    reductions from abroad. The low cost of compliance indicated in the analysis is based on
    the assumption that the vast majority -- as much as 75 percent -- will be reached by
    buying &quot;reductions&quot; from abroad. </p>
    <p>&quot;The current approach runs absolutely counter to President Clinton&#146;s rhetoric
    about how energy efficiency and renewables like solar and wind power can help avert global
    warming,&quot; said Cook. In fact, studies by the US Department of Energy, among others,
    have shown that the majority of greenhouse gas cuts can be achieved at home at the same or
    lower cost through the use of energy efficiency and renewables. </p>
    <p>The White House approach also gives away America&#146;s competitive edge in renewable
    energy and efficiency technologies to Europe and Japan, as we continue our dependence on
    imported oil -- and on importing &quot;reduction&quot; credits needed to burn it. </p>
    <p>Cook said the CEA analysis continues to send the wrong message to developing nations.
    &#147;The White House approach allows the US to continue to pollute at virtually the same
    rate, so why would we expect developing nations to get serious about reducing their own
    emissions?&#148; Cook said. </p>
    <p>A &quot;reductions&quot; plan based only on emissions trading would deny the U.S.
    public desperately needed improvements in air quality -- a tragic missed opportunity for
    an Administration that touts its concern for children's health. </p>
    <p>As a further example of the disconnect between the White House's rhetoric on climate
    change and its actions, earlier this week the Mineral Management Service announced it
    would be holding offshore oil lease sales in the Alaskan Arctic, in waters adjoining the
    Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. &quot;We cannot afford to burn even 25% of the oil and
    other fossil fuels we have already discovered, yet the Clinton Administration is inviting
    oil companies to drill for more in pristine waters of the Arctic,&quot; Cook said. </p>
    <p>&quot;As many Americans face the 26th day of deadly, record-breaking heat, we remind
    the Administration that it will take much more than emissions trading to stop further
    climate change in the long term,&quot; Cook said. &quot;We must follow up our Kyoto
    commitments with concrete actions like eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, embracing
    renewable energy sources, and placing a moratorium on all federal offshore oil lease
    sales.&quot; </p>
