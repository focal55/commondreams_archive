    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 30 - U.S. PIRG marked the 20th Anniversary of Love
    Canal with the release of a new report, based on data obtained from EPA, that lists the
    top 25 Superfund polluters in the country and their Superfund sites in each state. The
    report focuses on General Electric, the company with the most Superfund sites nationwide
    and a leader in the current effort to get special exemptions and to roll back the
    Superfund law in Congress.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For the past twenty years since Love Canal, many of the companies responsible for
    the greatest number of Superfund sites have continued to drag their feet, point fingers,
    and try to roll back the Superfund law in Congress, rather than paying for the strong,
    permanent cleanups that citizens deserve,&quot; said PIRG environmental attorney Daniel
    Rosenberg. &quot;This report shines the spotlight on General Electric, the nation&#146;s
    top Superfund polluter and a leader in the effort to roll back the Superfund law in
    Congress.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Among the findings in the report, entitled Super Polluters: The Top 25 Superfund Polluters
    and their Toxic Waste Sites:<br>
    <br>
    ** At least one of the Super Polluters is considered a &quot;potentially responsible
    party&quot; by EPA at 331 of the 1,194 non-federal Superfund sites, 28% of the total.<br>
    <br>
    **General Electric is a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites in at least 28
    states. 42 States have at least one Superfund site where at least one of the Top 25
    Superfund polluters is named by EPA as a potentially responsible party.<br>
    <br>
    ** The Top 10 Superfund Polluters and the number of their Superfund sites are: General
    Electric (86), DuPont (81), General Motors (64), Union Carbide (51), Shell Oil (48),
    Browning Ferris Industries (43), Ford Motor (40), Ashland Chemical (39), Westinghouse
    Electric (39), Ciba-Geigy (38).<br>
    <br>
    ** The 5 states with the most Superfund sites are: New Jersey (117), Pennsylvania (110),
    California (94), New York (88), Michigan (82).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Unfortunately, many companies, including General Electric, the top superfund
    polluter, have decided that it is better for business to spend money on lawyers and
    lobbyists and to avoid their responsibility to clean up these sites, while simultaneously
    they work to weaken the law designed to make them pay,&quot; Rosenberg commented.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;BusinessWeek recently called General Electric CEO Jack Welch `America's #1 Manager.'
    But Mr. Welch should more properly by cited for managing General Electric's high profile
    campaigns against cleaning up the Hudson River, the nation's largest Superfund site, and
    the Housatonic River in Pittsfield, Massachusetts where GE &quot;donated&quot;
    PCB-contaminated fill to residents and schools, while leading the efforts to roll back the
    Superfund law in Congress,&quot; said Rosenberg. &quot;This month in the House, GE has
    succeeded in adding language to the report accompanying EPA&#146;s budget that would
    prevent the agency from using dredging as a cleanup remedy at sites contaminated with
    PCBs. That single provision will achieve GE&#146;s main goal: avoid paying to fully clean
    up the Hudson river, the Housatonic river as well as other contaminated sites,&quot;
    Rosenberg added.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The anti-Superfund lobby is pushing to pass bills and riders in Congress, under the
    guise of `fixing&#146; the Superfund program, that would roll back the polluter pays
    principle of Superfund, weaken cleanup standards at the nation's worst hazardous waste
    sites, and reduce public participation in cleanup decisions. General Electric proposing to
    fix Superfund is like Al Capone proposing to fix the tax code,&quot; Rosenberg charged.
    &quot;Meanwhile, restoration of the expired tax on oil and chemical companies that pays
    for many Superfund cleanups is being held hostage by these same special interest
    groups,&quot; he added.<br>
    <br>
    $4 million dollars a day, $1.6 billion per year, for Superfund cleanups is not being
    collected, because the Superfund tax expired in December, 1995. The Superfund Trust Fund
    is projected to run out of money in the year 2000.<br>
    <br>
    Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and 58 of his House colleagues have co-sponsored a
    bill that would broaden the polluter pays principle, strengthen health standards, protect
    small parties from abusive lawsuits by big polluters, increase citizen participation in
    cleanup decisions and expand the public's right to know about toxics in their communities.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There is still time to pass a positive Superfund reauthorization bill before
    Congress adjourns for the year,&quot; said Rosenberg. We support the Pallone bill and urge
    members of Congress to support the same responsible approach to Superfund reauthorization.
    In addition, we urge President Clinton to veto the VA-HUD Appropriations bill, which
    includes EPA&#146;s budget, unless all the anti-environmental riders and report language,
    including the special GE PCB rider, are removed. The anniversary of Love Canal should be
    an occasion for strengthening, not weakening, our toxic waste cleanup law,&quot; he added.<p align="center">#&nbsp; #&nbsp; #</p>

    U.S. PIRG's Super Polluters report.</strong><br>
    <br>
    STATEMENT OF LOIS GIBBS<br>
    <br>
    Twenty years ago, residents of Love Canal, NY discovered that our homes had been
    contaminated, and our children were being made sick, by 20,000 tons of highly toxic
    chemical waste dumped by the Hooker Chemical Company in the 1940s and 1950s. The plight of
    citizens at Love Canal outraged the American public and led to the passage in 1980 of the
    Superfund law to find and clean up the nation&#146;s worst toxic dumps.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, Love Canal is not an isolated incident. In thousands of communities across
    the nation, millions of pounds of toxic chemicals including lead, arsenic, mercury and
    dioxin have been dumped in the midst of unsuspecting neighborhoods. They are the legacy of
    decades of irresponsible use and disposal of toxic chemicals by polluters. These sites
    poison the land, contaminate drinking water sources, and potentially cause cancer, birth
    defects, nerve damage and other health effects. The worst of these sites are Superfund
    sites.<br>
    <br>
    The core principle of the Superfund program is that polluters -- not taxpayers -- should
    pay to clean up these deadly toxic waste sites. In addition to providing funding for the
    cleanups (and ensuring that taxpayers don&#146;t get stuck footing the bill), the polluter
    pays principle creates a powerful disincentive against the reckless dumping of toxic
    wastes.<br>
    <br>
    On the 20th Anniversary of Love Canal, our laws to clean up toxic waste should be
    strengthened, not weakened. Congress should restore the hazardous waste cleanup tax on
    polluting industries and reject all efforts to roll back Superfund and other environmental
    laws.</p>
