    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - July 7 - In a report released today, Human Rights Watch
    accuses local governments and federal officials of failing to address a common human
    rights abuse in the United States: police brutality. <br>
    <br>
    The 450-page report charges that shoddy internal investigations do not hold police
    officers<br>
    accountable for abusive acts, and that criminal prosecutions rarely result. Civilian
    review agencies lack the funding and access they need to monitor police adequately. Some
    cities<br>
    pay tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in civil lawsuits alleging brutality, rather than
    addressing the underlying problems. <br>
    <br>
    The report is based on research conducted in fourteen cities over a two-year period and
    found several problems common to all of them. The cities are: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,
    Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles , Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia,
    Portland, Providence, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Police departments like to claim that each high-profile abuse is an aberration,
    committed by a `rogue' officer,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the New
    York-based Human Rights Watch. &quot;But these human rights violations persist because the
    accountability systems are so defective.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Abuses such as unjustified shootings, severe beatings, fatal chokings, and other forms of
    brutal physical treatment have been reported in cities throughout the United States. These
    abuses, and officials' unwillingness to curtail them, are violations of international
    human rights<br>
    treaties by which the United States is bound. They are also violations of most police
    departments' policies, and state and federal law. Furthermore, they are a betrayal of the
    public these officers are sworn to serve. <br>
    <br>
    Data on police abuse is very hard to obtain. Internal affairs units operate under a cloak
    of secrecy and are reluctant to release even basic information about their activities. In
    1994, Congress instructed the Justice Department to compile statistics and produce an
    annual report on the use of excessive force nationwide. Nearly four years later, no such
    report has been published. <br>
    <br>
    Human Rights Watch offers the following recommendations for reform: <br>
    <br>
    making federal aid to police departments conditional on regular reporting about the use of
    excessive force, and on improvements in oversight and discipline&nbsp; creating, among
    police and political leaders, a policy of zero tolerance for abuses&nbsp; establishing
    early warning systems to identify &quot;at-risk&quot; officers and remove those who commit
    abuses&nbsp; providing adequate funding and political support for civilian review agencies
    &nbsp; hiring special prosecutors in each state to handle criminal prosecutions of police.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the cities where such data are available, minorities have alleged human rights
    violations by police more frequently than white residents, and far out of proportion to
    their representation in those cities. Police have subjected minorities to apparently
    discriminatory treatment and have physically abused minorities while using racial
    epithets. <br>
    <br>
    The Abner Louima case in New York last year, in which a Haitian immigrant claimed officers
    sodomized him with a stick and beat him, shocked the world. The officers who knew what
    happened were unwilling to report the incident immediately or to come forward with
    information later, and the alleged perpetrators apparently believed that they would get
    away with this egregious act even though it took place in a busy station house.
    &quot;While many American cities, and even foreign countries, look to New York as a model
    of effective policing, the city also offers a model of how not to run a system of
    accountability,&quot; said Roth. <br>
    <br>
    Habitually brutal officers - usually a small percentage of officers on a force - may be
    the subject of repeated complaints but are usually protected by the silence of their
    fellow officers and by substandard internal police investigations. Their violent histories
    emerge, and are addressed, only after they commit an abuse that is so flagrant, so
    unavoidably embarrassing, that it cannot be ignored. And even if the individual officer is
    appropriately disciplined eventually, the officer's superiors - who should have intervened
    to curtail the abuses - typically escape scrutiny or any disciplinary actions. <br>
    <br>
    In practice, civil lawsuits actually allow police departments to ignore abuses committed
    by officers. Damages paid to victims do not come from the budget of the police department
    or officer personally: in almost all cases, the city pays any settlement or jury award. In
    most cities, no investigation is triggered by the filing, the settlement or the judgment
    relating to a lawsuit against an officer, no matter how severe the allegation. The
    officer's performance evaluations are usually unaffected. <br>
    <br>
    Criminal prosecution of police officers is rare. Local prosecutors are reluctant to pursue
    cases against officers accused of human rights violations because they typically work
    closely with police to prosecute criminals. Winning such cases can be difficult, due to
    victims who may be criminals themselves and many juries' tendency to believe police
    accounts. Federal prosecution of officers under criminal civil rights statutes is also
    rare. In Fiscal Year 1996, for example, out of 11,721 total complaints received by the
    Justice Department's civil rights division, only thirty-seven cases involving law
    enforcement officials were presented to a grand jury, with a total of twenty-nine
    convictions or pleas. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Local and federal prosecutors just aren't doing the job of going after officers
    accused of human rights violations,&quot; said Roth.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;State governments need to appoint special prosecutors if they want to address these
    terrible crimes.&quot; <p align="center">###</td>
