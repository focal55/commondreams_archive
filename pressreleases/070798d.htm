    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 7 - More than 15 conservation and Native American
    organizations warned today that dropping federal protection of the eastern timber wolf in
    the Great Lakes region would be premature and unwarranted.<br>
    <br>
    Reacting to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) announcement earlier this week that the
    agency will consider deleting the region's wolves from the list of species protected under
    the Endangered Species Act, the conservationists say insufficient state wolf protections
    are in place.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Conservationists have fought hard for a quarter of a century to help wolves make a
    comeback in the United States, and we want to ensure adequate protections so that once
    they are removed from the Endangered Species list, they won't ever have to be put back on
    it,&quot; Defenders of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen declared. &quot;Any
    delisting action must be accompanied by a detailed post-delisting management plan.
    Although Michigan has an approved plan, Wisconsin's plan is only in draft form and
    Minnesota lacks even a draft plan.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Besides Defenders of Wildlife, national groups with serious reservations about the
    proposed delisting plan at this time include the Sierra Club, Humane Society of the United
    States, Indigenous Environmental Network, U.S. Public Interest Research Group and The Wolf
    Recovery Foundation. Minnesota groups concerned about delisting in the absence of a state
    management plan include the Wildlife Education Program, Help Our Wolves Live (HOWL), the<br>
    Minnesota Wolf Alliance, the Minnesota Sierra Club, Friends of Animals and Their
    Environment and the Fond du Lac band of Chippewa.<br>
    <br>
    Other state and regional groups include Sinapu in Colorado and the New England-based
    Restore the North Woods, Maine Wolf Coalition, Northern Forest Chapter of the Sierra Club
    and Greater Laurentian Wildlands Project.<br>
    <br>
    When the eastern timber wolf was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1973, wolf
    numbers were at a precariously low level of between 500 and 1000 wolves, and they resided
    in less than 3 percent of their former range. Although there has been significant
    improvement in wolf numbers since that time -- wolves in the Midwest now number more than
    2,200 -- many groups believe the states are not ready to assume primary protection of the
    wolves.<br>
    <br>
    FWS will announce its proposal next fall. If the agency proposes delisting, it could take
    effect next year.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The delisting process should be at least as scientifically rigorous as is the
    listing process,&quot; said Carl Zichella, midwest regional director for the Sierra Club.
    &quot;Not only are wolf populations at stake, but so are the ecosystems in which they
    live.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    According to the Minnesota Wolf Alliance, the months remaining before the proposal would
    not give Minnesota enough time to draft a plan. Wisconsin and Michigan took two and five
    years, respectively, to write their plans. Meanwhile, Minnesota officials seem eager to
    open a hunting and trapping season on wolves following delisting.<br>
    <br>
    According to both the Sierra Club and HOWL, the wolf population has been able to prosper
    in Minnesota largely because of a successful lawsuit brought against the federal
    government by environmental groups in the early 1980's to bar wolf hunting and trapping.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As top predators, wolves will not do well if they are allowed to be hunted. Hunting
    is indiscriminate and it will destroy the social structure of the pack,&quot; said Jean
    Brave Heart of the Minnesota Wolf Alliance. &quot;It seems the delisting process has
    started before we have assurance that there will be a responsible management plan in place
    that does not include wolf hunting.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Even with federal protection, these states have been unable to control illegal wolf
    killings. Defenders of Wildlife is offering rewards of $1,000 each for information leading
    to the convictions of those responsible for killing three wolves in Wisconsin and more
    than 20 wolves in Minnesota.<br>
    <br>
    Many groups that work on wolf issues were not consulted before Monday's announcement by
    Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Jamie Clark.
    Representatives of these groups say the announcement was made for political reasons to
    please Minnesota officials and hunting groups.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tribes are supposed to be consulted before decisions regarding delisting of the wolf
    per a Secretarial order,&quot; said Esther Nahgahnub, acting chairperson of the Fond du
    Lac band. &quot;The wolf is of utmost importance to indigenous peoples both culturally and
    spiritually. In addition, much of wolf habitat in Minnesota is on indigenous land, so we
    need to have more input.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Robert Shimek of the Indigenous Environmental Network said there are many parallels
    between wolf policy and Indian policy. According to an indigenous creation story, he
    pointed out, what happens to wolves happens to humans, making a secure future for the wolf
    even more significant. &quot;The spiritual and traditional members of our indigenous
    communities historically have been shut out of the decision making process that involve
    resource management. This has altered our ability to sustain traditional relationships to
    the land. The wolf balances these relationships and makes us all stronger,&quot; he added.<br>
    <br>
    Allen Rutberg, a senior scientist with the Humane Society of the United States, summed up
    the coalition's concerns: &quot;The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is under pressure to
    demonstrate that the Endangered Species Act works. Of course the act works, but this
    particular decision was driven by politics, not science. At this point it seems that the
    intention to delist wolves in the Great Lakes region is being made to appease politicians
    and those who've been dying to hunt<br>
    wolves for years.&quot;<p align="center">-0-</td>
