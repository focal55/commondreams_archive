    Solutions&quot; </strong><br>
    <br>
    WASHINGTON - July 8 - The Violence Policy Center issued the following statement from VPC
    Director of Federal Policy Kristen Rand about President Clinton's press conference on gun
    safety, scheduled for this morning:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;President Clinton clearly hopes today's White House press event will burnish his
    credentials as an opponent of gun violence. But action speaks louder than words - even
    words spoken in the Rose Garden. This week's true test of commitment to gun control is at
    the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where the Senate is now debating a disastrous
    product liability bill that would shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits by gun victims.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;President Clinton has turned his back on gun control by supporting this product
    liability bill, and now he wants to change the subject. While the gun safety bill he is
    expected to endorse today is a good piece of legislation, its passage is a far-off dream
    while the liability bill is a nightmare for gun control right now.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;By inviting gun victims to the White House one day, and kicking them out of the
    courthouse the next day, President Clinton proves that he cares more about photo ops than
    real solutions to gun violence. Like a stage magician, he hopes to distract his audience
    from the real action with engaging chatter and a quick flourish. The only thing that will
    disappear if he pulls off this trick is the right of ordinary citizens to seek justice
    after their lives are torn apart by guns. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The real hero at the White House today is Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), the sponsor of
    the gun safety bill receiving the President's blessing. Sen. Durbin has worked hard to
    write this bill, but he isn't resting on those laurels. He understands that the gun
    industry has responsibility for gun safety, not just parents. That's why Sen. Durbin also
    opposes the product liability bill and supports an amendment to cut its limits on gun
    litigation.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As for the President, a hundred Rose Garden press conferences won't be enough to
    undo the damage of signing the product liability bill.&quot;<p align="center">###</p>
