    In Africa; Researchers to Deny HIV-positive Pregnant Women Effective, Less Expensive Drug

    involved in HIV experiments continue to be denied effective treatment, resulting in the
    needless infection of dozens of babies, says Public Citizen's Health Research Group.<br>
    <br>
    Despite the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s identification of
    &nbsp; a less-expensive regimen of AZT capable of reducing HIV transmission from mother to
    infant by 51%, several studies now being designed still do not plan to provide this
    potentially life-saving intervention, says the group.<br>
    <br>
    This and further unethical aspects of past and present perinatal HIV trials in developing
    countries will be explored by Peter Lurie, MD, MPH of Public Citizen's Health Research
    Group in an oral presentation at 15:00 on Wednesday, July 1, 1998 in Hall I at the 12th
    World AIDS Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.&nbsp; In a highly unusual scheduling
    decision by the organizers, Dr. Hoosen Coovadia of the University of Natal in South
    Africa, who has conducted some of the unethical research, is to provide a
    &quot;Reply&quot; immediately after&nbsp; Dr. Lurie's presentation.<br>
    <br>
    In April 1997, Public Citizen's Health Research Group criticized 15 studies, most funded
    by the U.S. government, in which thousands of HIV-positive pregnant women were denied
    access to AZT, a drug shown in a study in the U.S. and France to dramatically reduce
    perinatal HIV transmission.&nbsp; The studies were designed to identify more affordable
    versions of the successful U.S./French&nbsp; regimen that could be utilized in developing
    countries where the vast majority of the 500,000 annual perinatal HIV transmission occur.
    &nbsp; Public Citizen criticized the failure to provide AZT to some of the women in these
    studies; in some studies women received placebos instead of the known effective
    medication.<br>
    <br>
    In September 1997, Public Citizen renewed its attack in the New England Journal of
    Medicine; the Journal's Executive Editor, Marcia Angell, supported Public Citizen's
    criticism.&nbsp; Despite this, most of the studies continued.&nbsp; In February 1998 a
    CDC-sponsored placebo-controlled study in Thailand confirmed what Public Citizen had
    predicted all along: short courses of AZT reduced the rate of HIV transmission from mother
    to infant, by 51%.<br>
    <br>
    In his presentation, Dr. Lurie will focus on three studies now being designed that do not
    provide even the less expensive regimen proved effective in the Thailand/CDC study to all
    study participants.&nbsp; For example, in a study Dr. Coovadia is now planning for
    potential funding from the Wellcome Trust, HIV-positive pregnant women would simply be
    observed to determine the rate and predictors of HIV transmission to infants, even though
    two provinces in South Africa are currently developing plans to provide AZT for such
    women.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is simply unbelievable that any researcher would design a study in which no
    intervention whatsoever is offered to the women, particularly after the Thai/CDC
    results,&quot; said Dr. Lurie.&nbsp; &quot;What was the purpose of the previous round of
    studies if not to identify drug regimens that could actually be offered to HIV-positive
    pregnant women?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Lurie will also discuss two U.S. government-funded studies: HIVNET 012 (Principal
    Investigator: Brooks Jackson, Johns Hopkins University) in which the HIV-positive pregnant
    women will not receive any AZT prior to delivery (this was an important part of the
    Thai/CDC regimen) and another HIVNET study involving chlorhexidine vaginal washings
    (Principal Investigator: Sten Vermund, University of Alabama) in which no women receive
    any AZT.<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Lurie will also examine the ethical implications of the failure to provide treatment
    for the women once they have delivered their infants; risks include the development of
    resistant HIV strains due to stopping and starting drug regimens.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It seems that these researchers have learned little from the initial debate over the
    ethics of the perinatal studies,&quot; said Dr. Lurie.&nbsp; &quot;Rather than embarking
    upon a second generation of unethical trials, the researchers should immediately redesign
    these studies&nbsp; to ensure that all women have access to life-saving antiretroviral
    medications.&quot;<p align="center">###<br>
