    &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; -Treaty Conference in Final Days -&nbsp; </strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    ROME - July 9 - As the final week of the Rome conference to create an International
    Criminal Court (ICC) approaches, Human Rights Watch today condemned a threat by the United
    States to sabotage the establishment of an independent and effective Court.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    In a statement this morning, the head of the United States delegation, Ambassador-at-Large
    for War Crimes David Scheffer, stunned diplomats from more than 150 nations with a warning
    that the US would &quot;actively oppose this Court&quot; unless Washington's restrictive
    position on the Court's jurisdiction prevails.&nbsp; He insisted that a suspect's own
    government should be required to ratify the ICC treaty before the Court could investigate
    any national of that country.&nbsp; In a remarkably blunt address, Scheffer also
    reiterated U.S. opposition to an independent ICC prosecutor who could initiate cases,
    arguing that only states or the Security Council should be allowed to refer cases to the
    court. Most delegations in Rome support the independent prosecutor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &quot;This is a new low in the Clinton Administration's approach to the ICC,&quot; said
    Richard Dicker, who leads the ICC campaign for Human Rights Watch, an international
    monitoring organization based in New York. &quot;It is outrageous that the US is trying to
    force other states to choose: either they keep the US happy and create a meaningless
    court, or they establish an effective institution and risk American efforts to sabotage
    it.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Today the US also proposed a two-tier jurisdictional system under which the ICC would only
    have automatic jurisdiction over genocide. For crimes against humanity and war crimes,
    which will form the great bulk of the ICC's docket, states that have already ratified the
    treaty could then still decide whether to allow the Court to bring cases against their
    nationals. The American proposal differs from the position that a majority of delegations
    in Rome support: that once states ratify the treaty, they automatically accept the Court's
    jurisdiction for all core crimes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &quot;The system proposed by the United States reduces the act of ratifying the treaty to
    a photo opportunity for states,&quot; said Dicker. &quot;It would allow states to ratify
    the treaty, but still prevent the Court from pursuing most investigations if they prove
    politically embarrassing to the state.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    US opposition to an independent prosecutor is also a minority position. &quot;Unless the
    prosecutor can initiate cases, this court will be dependent on&nbsp; political decisions
    by states and the Council and thus will be powerless to investigate many serious
    crimes,&quot; said Dicker. &quot;We know from experience that states rarely file
    complaints, and the Security Council reacts only selectively.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The US finds itself&nbsp; in the company of&nbsp; a minority of states opposed to an
    effective Court, including&nbsp; Russia, China, Iraq, Libya, India and Mexico. A growing
    majority of states, including the 60-member &quot;like-minded&quot; group comprising
    Canada, Australia and virtually all European countries, as well as key democracies such as
    South Korea, South Africa, Senegal, Argentina and Chile, support a court with an
    independent prosecutor, full jurisdiction over war crimes in internal armed conflicts,
    free from Security Council control and with the ability to investigate cases when any one
    of several interested states has ratified the court's statute.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The ICC will be different from the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which
    addresses only disputes between states, and different from the ad-hoc tribunals or Rwanda
    and the former Yugoslavia, which are temporary and involve only specific countries. The
    International CriminalCourt will be a permanent forum to prosecute and punish individuals
    who commit egregious human rights violations.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The establishment of an effective ICC will be a significant milestone in the enforcement
    of human rights worldwide. &quot;A genuinely effective and independent ICC could
    dramatically transform the human rights landscape in the next century,&quot; said Dicker.
    &quot;But not if the U.S. gets its way.&quot;<p align="center">###</td>
