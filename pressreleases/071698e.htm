    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 16 - An examination of state legislation in 13 areas
    of basic managed care consumer protections finds that no state has all 13 on the books
    according to a new report released today by the national consumer group Families USA. <br>
    <br>
    Hit &amp; Miss: State Managed Care Laws <br>
    <br>
    examines state laws for a number of patient protections including the right to independent
    external appeals when health care services are denied, access to emergency room coverage,
    the right to sue health plans for wrongful denials of care, and the establishment of state
    funded consumer assistance programs.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The study reveals that only one state, Vermont, had passed 10 or more of the protections,
    16 states enacted 5 to 9 of the basic protections, 33 states had passed only 1 to 4 of the
    protections and South Dakota had passed none. The report also reveals that, despite state
    legislation on managed care, many consumers are not protected by those laws.<br>
    <br>
    According to the report, one in three people with employer-based coverage are in
    self-insured health plans and are not covered by state consumer protection laws. The
    federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) exempts self-insured employer
    plans from state health insurance laws. Approximately 51 million Americans are not covered
    by any of the managed care consumer protection laws in their state because of ERISA.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not only do managed care consumer protections vary greatly from state to
    state,&quot; said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, &quot;but even with
    laws on the books, many consumers who get their coverage from their employer are not
    protected because of ERISA. Only a federal patients&#146; Bill of Rights would ensure
    consumer protections for all Americans who receive employer provided coverage.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Other key findings of the report include:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The requirement of disclosure of treatment options and protection advocacy (that is, a ban
    on &quot;gag rules&quot;) has been passed by the most states -- 45 states and the District
    of Columbia.&nbsp; Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have passed laws
    requiring health plans to pay for emergency room care when a person believes he or she is
    experiencing a medical emergency. <br>
    Only 15 states have passed laws establishing an independent external appeals process for
    consumers who believe they have been wrongfully denied care. <br>
    <br>
    Eight states have passed laws requiring plans to have a procedure to allow individuals to
    obtain prescription drugs that are not on the managed care plan&#146;s list or
    &quot;formulary.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Of the 13 key protections studied, the establishment of independent consumer assistance
    programs and changes in liability laws had been passed by the fewest states.&nbsp; Vermont
    is the first and only state to pass a law that provides funding for an independent
    statewide consumer assistance program.&nbsp; Two states, Texas and Missouri, passed laws
    that open the door so that consumers can hold their health plans accountable through
    litigation. This issue is still being debated in the courts. <br>
    <br>
    While the ERISA statute preempts state insurance laws for people in self-insured plans,
    the statute goes even further in preventing Americans from suing their health plans for
    damages in the event of wrongful denials of care. The study found that 83 percent of
    Americans who get their health care from their employer, 124 million people, cannot hold
    their health plans liable for their denials of care because of ERISA preemption of state
    laws relating to grievance resolution. Public employees (state and federal workers) are
    not preempted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;ERISA &#150; which was intended to protect employees in pensions and health plans
    &#150; has become a protective shield for managed care plans even when they wrongfully
    deny care, either through negligence or malicious indifference,&quot; added Judy Waxman,
    director of government affairs at Families USA. &quot;Health plans have no accountability
    for their decisions to deny needed care and treatment. This lack of meaningful remedies
    invites abuse.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Current proposals in Congress address many of the protections studies in the new Families
    USA report. The Patients&#146; Bill of Rights introduced by Senators Daschle and Kennedy
    and Representatives Dingell and Gephardt would establish all 13 of the protections
    studied. The House Republican proposal, which is not yet in legislative form, would
    address from two to four of the issues. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The American public has said very clearly that they want managed care protections,
    but because of ERISA they are denied the protections passed by their state,&quot; added
    Pollack. &quot;Because of the federal ERISA law, this issue can not be left up to the
    states. Federal protections are needed to ensure all Americans get fair treatment from
    their managed care plans.&quot; <br>
