    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - Augyst 14 - A federal district court decision barring
    voucher-style aid to religious schools protects taxpayers and constitutional principles,
    according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This decision sends a strong message that taxpayers should never be forced to
    support private religious education,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of
    Americans United, a watchdog group that provided legal assistance in the case. &quot;The
    Maine case was one more attempt to tear down public education and introduce a voucher
    program subsidizing private religious schools. The court rightly said no.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In Strout v. Maine Department of Education, U.S. District Court Judge D. Brock Hornby
    ruled Aug. 11 that the state is not required to pay for religious school tuition in public
    school districts where there are no public schools. Under Maine law, the state in such
    situations pays only for enrollment at nearby public or nonsectarian private schools.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The plaintiffs certainly are free to send their children to a sectarian school. That
    is a right protected by the Constitution,&quot; Judge Hornby wrote. &quot;The law is
    clear, however, that they do not have the right to require taxpayers to subsidize that
    choice.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    TV preacher Pat Robertson's legal group, the American Center for Law and Justice, helped
    bring the suit against the state, backing local parents who wanted state funds for tuition
    at St. Dominic's Regional High School, a private Catholic school.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Robertson and other religious school supporters have waged an unrelenting crusade
    against public schools and for tax aid to private religious schools,&quot; Lynn added.
    &quot;With this defeat in Maine, Robertson faces one more court decision showing that the
    law is not on his side.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded
    in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied houses of worship in all 50
    states, and has been involved in legal challenges to every voucher plan passed in the U.S.<p align="center">-30- </td>
