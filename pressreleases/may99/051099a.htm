- May 10 - Later today, the National Rifle Association will once again attempt 
to pass off old bromides as new cures for the problems of gun violence &#150; 
problems that the Senate will begin addressing this week. History has shown that 
the NRA is no friend of the police, no friend of prosecutors and no friend of 
the families and victims of America&#146;s love affair with guns. </font><font color="#000000">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Once again, the NRA will portray 
itself as an ardent defender of law enforcement, and claim that the real problem 
is not proliferation of guns through loopholes in existing law, but that prosecution 
of gun laws are down and existing laws are not being enforced. As usual, this 
is not the case. And as usual, the NRA will only offer &#145;get tough&#146; punishments 
for criminals who have already committed gun crimes, without one suggestion as 
to how to keep guns away from criminals (or children) in the first place.</small></font></p>
<u><b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>THAT WAS THEN:</small></font>
</b></u> 
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The NRA has for years successfully 
blocked the computerization by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) 
of gun sale records from out-of-business gun dealers. Thanks to the NRA-imposed 
restrictions, when a gun is traced as part of a criminal investigation, the files 
must often be retrieved manually from warehouses where the records are kept. As 
a result, hours or even days are added to the time needed to complete the successful 
trace of a crime gun. As a result, criminals avoid detection and criminal investigations 
are impeded. </small></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The NRA has maintained its 
steadfast opposition to waiting periods for handgun purchases, despite the need 
for a &quot;cooling off&quot; period to prevent impulse crimes and suicides. Because 
of NRA lobbyists, the waiting period included in the original Brady law expired 
in 1998, and the gun lobby is fighting efforts to reinstate it in 1999.</small></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The NRA likes to talk tough 
when it comes to criminals. But just last month, the NRA spent over $3.7 million 
to try to pass a referendum in Missouri, Proposition B, which would have allowed 
almost anyone, even convicted criminals with misdemeanor records, to carry a concealed 
weapon almost anywhere in the state. The referendum would have even permitted 
people convicted of stalking and child molestation the ability to carry a hidden 
handgun into bars, stadiums, parks, school yards and other public places. Fortunately, 
Missouri voters rejected Proposition B the NRA&#146;s intense lobbying effort 
to put more guns on our streets.</small></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>At every opportunity, the 
NRA has sought to decrease or eliminate the funding of the ATF, the law enforcement 
agency whose mission it is to oversee gun crimes and trace the guns used in the 
commission of crimes. Because of NRA-sponsored legislation, investigators seeking 
to trace the path of the guns used in the Littleton school massacre were forced 
to plod through paper records stretching among numerous states, culminating in 
a dead end at Colorado gun shows. Only through legwork and luck were investigators 
able to piece together how the four weapons ended up in the hands of the teenage 
shooters. The NRA continues to vociferously oppose any gun registration system 
that would allow law enforcement to retain records so as to easily trace guns 
used in crime.</small></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>In 1986, the NRA got legislation 
passed which restricts ATF inspection of gun dealers to once a year. Even dealers 
who are the source for hundreds of crime guns cannot be routinely inspected more 
than once a year without a special court warrant. Of course, this is consistent 
with the NRA letter describing ATF as &quot;jack-booted thugs,&quot; which caused 
former president George Bush to publicly resign his NRA membership in protest.</small></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The NRA has always resisted 
efforts to get cheap &quot;Saturday Night Specials&quot; off the streets, with 
the preposterous claim that people of lesser means will not be able to afford 
guns, although a Florida Technological University study has shown that nearly 
70 percent of convicted felons reported using low-quality guns in the commission 
of crime. According to a 1995 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) report, 
four out of the top five and seven of the top ten guns most frequently traced 
to crime in 1994 were Saturday Night Specials.</small></font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Incredibly, the NRA has fought 
to put guns into the hands of convicted felons. In 1992, the NRA fought for a 
bill that would, at the taxpayers&#146; expense, allow criminals convicted of 
violent crimes to appeal to the government for &quot;relief&quot; from the &quot;disability&quot; 
of being prohibited from owning a gun. They have quietly attempted to get &quot;gun 
restoration&quot; programs funded ever since.</small></font></li>
</ul>
<u>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>THIS IS NOW:</small></font>
</u> 
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><small>Overall, prosecution for 
gun crimes is on the rise</small></b></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Federal prosecutions tend 
to focus on the worst offenders (those sentenced to five years or more), and those 
prosecutions have increased by 30 percent according to the Department of Justice. 
The total number of federal and state prosecutions has gone up, putting about 
25 percent more criminals behind bars, from 20,681 in 1992 to 25,186 in 1997.</small> 
</font>
<ul>
<b>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The Brady Law is working</small></font></li>
</b> 
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Since the implementation of 
the Brady Law in February 1994, almost a quarter-million prohibited purchasers 
have been stopped from buying handguns in gun stores, according to the U.S. Department 
of Justice. Since 1994, gun-related violent crime has been dropping even faster 
than violent crime overall, and a 1997 study by the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence demonstrated a dramatic decrease in interstate gun trafficking since 
the Brady Law went into effect. In fact, states that began conducting background 
checks on handgun purchasers when the Brady Law went into effect are as much as 
86% less likely to be sources of guns used in crimes in other states than they 
were prior to when the checks were performed.</small> </font>
<ul>
<b>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Project Exile is a no-argument 
argument</small></font></li>
</b> 
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The NRA supports Project Exile, 
a program pioneered in Richmond that increases federal prosecution of gun crime. 
Guess what. So does Handgun Control &#150; and so do most gun control advocates, 
who see no contradiction between tough prevention and tough punishment. Only the 
NRA offers punishment <i>INSTEAD </i>of prevention as their only argument.</small></font></p>
<b><u>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>THIS IS NEXT:</small></font></p>
</u></b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Prosecutors and law enforcement 
nationwide have called for the closing of loopholes that allow guns to flow to 
children or criminals. Bills addressing these loopholes have been introduced in 
the 106<sup>th</sup> Congress, and may be re-introduced this week as amendments 
to the juvenile crime bill.</small></font></p>
<b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>1) The Child Access Loophole</small></font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Adults are prohibited from 
transferring firearms to juveniles, but are not required to store guns so that 
kids cannot get access to them. This Child Access Prevention (CAP) proposal would 
require parents to keep loaded firearms out of the reach of children and would 
hold gun owners criminally responsible if a child gains access to an unsecured 
firearm and uses it to injure themselves or someone else. <i>The NRA opposes CAP.</i></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small><b>2) The Gun Show Loophole</b></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>So-called &quot;private collectors&quot; 
can sell guns without background checks at gun shows and flea markets thereby 
skirting the Brady law which requires that federally licensed gun dealers initiate 
and complete a background check before they sell a firearm. No gun should be sold 
at a gun show without a background check and appropriate documentation. <i>The 
NRA defends the &quot;right&quot; of private collectors to sell their guns whenever, 
wherever, to whomever.</i></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small><b>3) The Internet Loophole</b></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Similar to the Gun Show Loophole, 
many sales on the Internet are performed without a background check, allowing 
criminals and other prohibited purchasers to acquire firearms. No one should be 
able to sell guns over the Internet without complying with the Brady background 
check requirements.</small></font></p>
<b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>4) The Juvenile Assault Weapon 
Possession Loophole</small></font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Although juveniles 18 and 
younger are prohibited by Federal law from purchasing handguns, neither the Federal 
government nor most states restrict the purchase and ownership of long guns. While 
this loophole allows teenagers to hunt with rifles and shotguns, it also allows 
them to possess semi-automatic AK-47s, AR-15s and other assault rifles manufactured 
before 1994 and &quot;grandfathered&quot; under the 1994 assault weapon ban. No 
juvenile should be allowed to buy or possess an assault rifle. <i>The NRA opposed 
the assault weapon ban, sponsored its attempted repeal, and has given no sign 
of support for keeping military weapons out of the hands of teenagers.</i></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small><b>5) The High-Capacity Ammunition 
Clip Importation Loophole</b></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The 1994 Assault Weapon Ban 
prohibited the future domestic manufacture and importation of magazines or ammunition 
feeding devices capable of holding more than ten rounds. However, any high-capacity 
magazines made before the date of enactment may be lawfully imported, possessed, 
sold or transferred. Foreign companies have circumvented the ban and dumped their 
products in our country. This bill would close the loophole by banning the importation 
of all large capacity magazines. <i>Although it is illegal in almost every state 
to hunt most animals with more than 10 bullets, the NRA supports the right to 
possess magazines holding 20, 30, 50 or even 100 rounds of ammunition. </i></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small><b>6) The Background Check 
Loophole</b></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>When the five-day waiting 
period provision of the Brady Law expired in November 1998, an &quot;instant check&quot; 
system went into effect. This new national database, however, does not contain 
many of the records that are necessary to complete a background check. This is 
particularly true for non-felony offenses (e.g. domestic violence) and mental 
health records. Nor does the instant check system allow time for a &quot;cooling-off&quot; 
period. There should be a three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases so 
all necessary records can be checked to ensure that only law-abiding people get 
guns. <i>The NRA has always opposed waiting periods for handgun purchases.</i></small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>The American Shooting Sports 
Council and the National Shooting Sports Council have apparently signaled that 
we can come together and agree that gunowners need to be held responsible if they 
allow access to their guns, that gun shows need to be regulated, that violent 
children should not be able to buy guns and become violent adults, that crime 
gun tracing should be expanded and the minimum age to buy as handgun should be 
21 years of age. Even gun manufacturers recognize that these are reasonable proposals 
to help curb gun violence.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><small>Why can&#146;t the NRA do 
the same?</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah 
Brady, is the nation&#146;s largest citizens&#146; gun control lobbying organization. 
Based in Washington, DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local 
gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974, HCI has 
more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local groups around the country 
to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws. More information about HCI and
