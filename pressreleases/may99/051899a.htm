<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OKLAHOMA 
CITY - May 18 - The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a federal lawsuit 
on behalf of a decorated Army veteran who was the victim of racial profiling by 
the state highway patrol.</font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During a two-and-a-half 
hour traffic stop on Interstate 40 here last August, state troopers dismantled 
the car of the Army veteran, Sergeant First Class Rossano V. Gerald, terrorized 
his 12-year-old son with a police dog and turned off the patrol car's video evidence 
camera halfway through the ordeal.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit -- the first 
of its kind in Oklahoma -- claims violations of federal civil rights law and of 
the Geralds' constitutional rights to equal treatment and to be free from unreasonable 
searches and seizures. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ACLU is seeking unspecified 
damages on behalf of SFC Gerald and his son, as well as a court order requiring 
state troopers to stop racial profiling and to establish legal safeguards, including 
a traffic stops reporting system, to prevent future incidents.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A native Panamanian and 
naturalized American citizen, SFC Gerald, 37, grew up as a self-described "army 
brat" at installations across the country. He said he is bringing the lawsuit 
to assure his son that even authority figures who abuse their powers can be brought 
to justice.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I'm an authority figure 
myself," said SFC Gerald, a career soldier and veteran of Operation United Shield 
in Somalia and Operation Desert Storm in Iraq, for which he received a Bronze 
Star. "I don't want my son thinking for one minute that this kind of behavior 
by anyone in uniform is acceptable."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the traffic stop, 
the ACLU's complaint alleges, state troopers:</font></P>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">warned SFC Gerald and his 
son that dogs would attack them if they attempted to "escape" </font>
<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">illegally claimed that 
state law allowed them to conduct a car search without his consent </font>
<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">shut off a video evidence 
camera halfway through the search </font>
<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">placed SFC Gerald and his 
son in a closed car with the air conditioner off in the summer heat </font>
<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">isolated 12-year-old Gregory 
for questioning in a car with a barking drug dog </font>
<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">refused to follow Army 
protocol and advise SFC Gerald's commanding officer of the stop </font>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent months, news reports 
have focused on incidents of racial profiling across the country, a phenomenon 
so widespread that many refer to it as "Driving While Black." The ACLU has successfully 
defended numerous victims of the practice and in response to recent incidents 
used national advertising to seek other victims. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But SFC Gerald's experience, 
the ACLU said, is particularly troubling not only because he was assumed to be 
a drug dealer based on his skin color, but because the troopers' actions were 
so repugnant.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is an element of 
lawlessness to this traffic stop that is truly frightening," said Reginald T. 
Shuford, an ACLU national staff attorney who is representing SFC Gerald. "It is 
disgraceful that a soldier who has traveled around the world representing United 
States interests should be made a prisoner in his own land."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the ACLU's 
complaint, the ordeal began on August 13, 1998, when SFC Gerald crossed from Arkansas 
into Oklahoma on I-40 West, on the way to a family reunion in the state. He was 
making the trip in his red 1991 Nissan sports car with his son Gregory.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On entering Oklahoma, SFC 
Gerald immediately noticed troopers in the area and drove with extra care. Nonetheless, 
he was stopped and questioned twice. In the first stop, the officer cautioned 
SFC Gerald about following another car too closely and departed without issuing 
a citation. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Less than thirty minutes 
later, SFC Gerald was stopped a second time by a different set of troopers who 
claimed that he had not signaled a lane change while the officers were following 
him. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the troopers asked 
to search the car, SFC Gerald, aware of his rights, politely declined. In keeping 
with Army protocol, he asked the trooper to instead notify his commanding officer 
of the situation. The troopers refused throughout the incident to contact the 
officer or to allow SFC Gerald to do so.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its complaint, the ACLU 
said, one trooper misstated the law, claiming that he was allowed to search the 
car even without SFC Gerald's consent. He then called in a K-9 unit from a second 
patrol car at the scene.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the dog failed to "alert" 
to the presence of drugs, the officers drilled beneath the floor of the car and 
claimed to find a "secret compartment" which was actually a footrest located under 
the carpet. During the search, the ACLU's complaint said, Gregory Gerald saw an 
officer turn off the police videotaping system and remove the tape.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SFC Gerald was then handcuffed 
and placed with his son in a patrol car with the warning that the dog would attack 
if they tried to escape. Despite the August heat, officers turned off the air 
conditioner, leaving the fan to blow hot air into the closed car. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"They were literally turning 
up the heat on me," SFC Gerald recalled. "I tried to reassure my son, who was 
very upset by this time, but after observing the officers' behavior, I started 
to get nervous myself."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The troopers next moved 
12-year-old Gregory to a separate car for questioning, without his father's consent. 
As officers questioned him, Gregory was terrorized by a police dog in the back 
seat of the car, who kept barking at him. After seeing troopers search his bags, 
he was also convinced that his airline tickets home had been confiscated and that 
he would be abandoned on the road after his father was arrested.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's bad enough that the 
troopers harassed and humiliated me in front of my son," SFC Gerald said. "But 
what I cannot forgive is the way they terrorized him, asking him if his daddy 
was a drug dealer."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After finally being released 
with nothing more than a warning ticket, SFC Gerald asked the troopers what they 
were going to do about the mess they had created of his car and baggage. The reply, 
he said, was: "We ain't good at repacking." </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerned that illegal contraband 
had been planted or that he might be stopped a third time that day, SFC Gerald 
next drove to nearby Fort Sill and asked army officers to conduct a thorough search 
of his car, including the use of drug-sniffing dogs, to document that he was not 
carrying any contraband. He also contacted his comanding officer to advise him 
of the situation.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Throughout his ordeal, 
SFC Gerald made all the right moves, while the troopers made all the wrong moves," 
said ACLU attorney Shuford. "Despite how the troopers treated him and his son, 
he never abandoned his respectful manner or his dignity."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joann Bell, Executive Director 
of the ACLU of Oklahoma, said that she hoped the filing of the lawsuit -- the 
first of its kind in the state -- would prompt more victims to come forward.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With this lawsuit, the 
ACLU is sending a message to troopers in Oklahoma and around the nation, and that 
message is: driving while black or brown is not a crime," she said.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case is Gerald v. Oklahoma 
Department of Public Safety, filed by ACLU attorney Shuford with the local assistance 
of Joel L. Carson of the law firm Carson & Mueller based in Oklahoma City.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copies of the Oklahoma lawsuit, 
as well as details of other ACLU "DWB" cases around the country, can be found 
on the ACLU's Freedom Network Website at www.aclu.org.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note to reporters: For interviews 
with SFC Gerald and his attorney Reginald Shuford, contact Amy Weil in the ACLU 
National Press Office at (212) 549-2561 or 2666. SFC Gerald is a fluent Spanish 
speaker.</font>
