- May 5 - The following was released today by the Federation of American Scientists:<br>
<br>
In light of the dangers of mass starvation in Kosovo, the Federation of American 
Scientists (FAS) is urging the Administration to consider the possibility of negotiating 
a Humanitarian Truce, lasting 30 to 60 days, during which bombing, fighting, and 
ethnic cleansing would be stopped, troops would stand down, aid workers, food, 
and medical supplies would be permitted to enter, and Kosovars would be permitted 
free movement across borders.<br>
<br>
The peaceful period could facilitate negotiations on both an international peace-keeping 
force and a long-term solution and, above all, would help avert otherwise impending 
starvation.<br>
<br>
The need for this truce is becoming ever more evident. On May 2, NATO Commander 
General Wesley Clark advised the world that 820,000 internally displaced people 
inside Kosovo are "...largely cut off from any sources of food or supplies, and 
communications, and living in conditions of hardship and danger." Physicians for 
Human Rights has said: "Mass death may be imminent."<br>
<br>
While such a truce would not be monitored immediately by armed international monitors, 
there would be the eyes and ears of the aid workers, and the truce would be conditional 
on the halt in fighting and ethnic cleansing. Perhaps the whole truce could be 
overseen by the same countries that would be leading candidates for supplying 
the eventual international forces.<br>
<br>
In any case, even an agreement on an international security force might not bring 
those forces into the field in time to save the lives of families now running 
out of food -- which could easily lead to the loss of many more lives than are 
being lost to atrocities. Under these circumstances, the difficulties of a Humanitarian 
Truce may be less than the difficulties of pursuing the present course or other 
alternatives.<br>
<br>
How far is this from the Administration's position? At the moment, the Administration 
has put off the problem of the future of Kosovo and is concerned with establishing 
the conditions under which refugees could go home. But it is not focused on the 
dangers to internal refugees, which require a greater urgency.<br>
<br>
On May 4, the President said "...under the right circumstances, we would be willing 
to have a bombing pause, but we would need acceptance of the basic principles 
(evidently of the occupation of Kosovo) and at least the beginning of withdrawal 
of Serb forces."<br>
<br>
The Humanitarian Truce could be organized to fulfill all those conditions except 
the "basic principles" under which the international force would be designed -- 
whether, for example, NATO-led, or just with NATO troops, or with NATO troops 
not involved in military activities, or with no NATO troops at all, etc. And the 
statement appears to recognize that the bombing halt would not await, in any case, 
the formation, arrival, and deployment in Kosovo of the international force designed 
to monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces to Serbia.<br>
<br>
Could NATO get the bombing started again, at the end of the truce period, if all 
went badly? One thing is clear: the opening up of Kosovo is going to provide enormous 
new evidence of atrocities and signs that many families have permanently lost 
their adult males. Under these circumstances, one could expect new political impetus 
to take further dramatic steps, if necessary.<br>
<br>
But the bombing is not going well anyway. It does not cause Milosevic physical 
pain, and he might easily be -- probably is -- more interested in maintaining 
power and not giving up Kosovo than he is in preventing bombs from falling on 
Yugoslavia. It may feel good to us to continue bombing -- but do we want to continue 
to downplay the well-being of almost 1,000,000 Albanians stuck in Kosovo?<br>
<br>
If one views Serbia as a kidnapper with ethnic Albanian hostages, NATO is in the 
position of a SWAT team that has moved -- albeit understandably -- in a precipitous 
way. The kidnapper has turned out to be more cruel, and more resistant to pressure 
than expected. The SWAT team feels, in part, that its reputation for good judgment, 
and success, has become at issue. But, in fact, the immediate problems of 820,000 
people must be placed in the forefront of moral considerations.<br>
<br>
It is true that the long-term return of the refugees is also a key factor. And 
it is argued by the Administration that refugees will not return unless the international 
force is "NATO-led" and/or has heavy weapons, and so on. This may have some truth 
to it, but it seems one factor among many, and there may be other ways to achieve 
their security.<br>
<br>
In general, it is important to observe that the correlation of forces has changed 
as a result of the bombing, the displacement of refugees, the political situation 
here and in Serbia, and many other factors. With this in mind, a Humanitarian 
Truce would permit a factoring in of these new elements. For example, Serbia is 
now in desperate economic condition and will need a release of sanctions and new 
investment. Here is an economic lever as important as military pressures and one 
less likely to provoke strong resistance.<br>
<br>
The Humanitarian Truce we have in mind is not a "bombing pause" but a bilateral 
stand-down of force and fighting. And it appears to be something that has not 
yet been considered. And since the situation inside Kosovo is likely to be even 
worse than we realize -- and new press reports daily are bearing this out -- we 
want the Administration to give this new approach some consideration if it believes 
that negotiations are likely to drag on.<br>
