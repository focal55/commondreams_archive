- May 6 - The following was released today by the National Community Reinvestment 
Coalition:<br>
<br>
"The U.S. Senate punched hard against the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and 
struck against the hopes of millions of working class and minority Americans for 
owning their first home or small business. The Senate has wounded the most effective 
fair lending law of the last 25 years," exclaims John Taylor, president and CEO 
of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC).<br>
<br>
Taylor continues, "But the fight is not over; the President has issued a veto 
threat; and NCRC is mobilizing thousands of community groups Mayors, religious 
leaders, civil rights organizations, and others who believe in the vital importance 
of CRA to their neighborhoods. The battle moves on to the House side, where chances 
are much greater of passing a community-friendly bill."<br>
<br>
Today, the Senate gave a hand-up to the banking, insurance, and securities, industries, 
and at the same time, a backhand to the average working class American," states 
John Taylor of NCRC.|<br>
<br>
The Senate is about to approve S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act 
of 1999, that tears down the walls separating banks, securities firms, and insurance 
companies. At the same time, the Senate approved anti-CRA provisions that would 
cripple the effectiveness of the law. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is 
an anti-redlining law mandating that banks have an affirmative obligation to serve 
all the communities, including low- and moderate-income communities, in which 
they are chartered and from which they take deposits. CRA has leveraged impressive 
amounts of loans and investments for traditionally underserved neighborhoods. 
In 1997, for example, low- and moderate-income neighborhoods received 32.5 billion 
dollars in home mortgage loans.<br>
<br>
NCRC Board Member Shelley Sheehy maintains, "CRA and nonprofit organizations make 
it possible for small rural banks to serve their communities. For example, in 
Brooklyn, Iowa a nonprofit developer, the Mid-America Housing Partnership, teamed 
up with Poweshiek Savings Bank to produce 10 new homes for young families and 
single mothers. In Deep River, Iowa with a population of 500 people, Gibson Savings 
worked with the nonprofit to build five new homes. CRA is literally housing a 
substantial number of people in these small towns."<br>
<br>
"Without CRA, we would not have partnerships with banks that make affordable home 
loans and small business loans to underserved neighborhoods," states NCRC member 
Jim Bliesner, Director, of the San Diego City-County Reinvestment Task Force. 
Washington Mutual, Bank of America, and five other banks partnering with the Task 
Force made $725 million in CRA loans and investments in 1997, more than triple 
the $175 million made in 1993.<br>
<br>
"Without the Community Reinvestment Act, we would have been unable to keep bank 
branches open and launch new housing developments in Cleveland's poorest neighborhoods, 
said Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White. "Our involvement in the merger application 
process and other CRA-related activities has allowed us to partner with local 
banks to direct over $3.2 billion in CRA financing to our neighborhoods in the 
last few years," Mayor White added (the City of Cleveland has been a NCRC member 
for several years).<br>
<br>
S. 900 would exempt more than 3,800 small banks headquartered in non-metropolitan 
areas with assets under $100 million. More than 72 percent of all rural lenders 
would be exempt from CRA. It would also make it nearly impossible for community 
organizations, Mayors, religious leaders, and the general public to comment to 
federal banking agencies considering bank merger applications. This is a key time 
for CRA enforcement when federal regulators make sure that the merging banks will 
maintain or improve their CRA performance. Citizens will be unable to offer their 
concerns about fees, access to branches, and the availability of loans in their 
area unless they can prove that the banks in question no longer deserve passing 
CRA ratings in all of their markets.<br>
<br>
NCRC Board Member Gene Lowe of the U.S. Conference of Mayors spearheaded a sign-on 
letter from more than 160 Mayors opposed to S.900. According to the letter, "Private 
sector investment encouraged under CRA has helped to stabilize communities suffering 
from economic decline. CRA has similarly helped to spur bank and thrift investment 
in multi-family rental housing and rehabilitation, small business expansion, and 
community economic development."<br>
<br>
A growing bipartisan consensus has emerged concerning the value of CRA. Last year, 
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) participated in the merger application process involving 
First Union and Corestates, citing access to reasonably priced banking services 
as one of his principal concerns. Editorials from the Washington Post, New York 
Times, Los Angeles Times, Atlanta Constitution and many other newspapers applauded 
the value of CRA and opposed weakening the law. Big and small banks including 
National City Bank and Iron and Glass Bank in Pittsburgh have written letters 
to Congress in favor of CRA and how it has helped them find profitable business 
opportunities.<br>
<br>
"If it were not for the ideological positions of a few Senators, we would be discussing 
the expansion of CRA and protecting communities as the financial industry is modernized 
and made more powerful by bills like S. 900," states NCRC's Taylor. "NCRC's 700 
community member organizations, hundreds of public officials, and countless others 
will prevail in persuading the House to do the right thing in protecting the hard 
won community reinvestment gains made possible by CRA."<br>

trade association of more than 700 community reinvestment organizations dedicated 
to revitalizing inner city neighborhoods and rural areas by promoting partnerships 
between lenders and community leaders. <br>
