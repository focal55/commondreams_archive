<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- May 20 - At a hearing today before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions, Ralph Nader criticized Channel One and urged its removal from 
the public schools. Following are excerpts of his testimony. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One is a marketing 
company that uses the schools to deliver advertising to captive audiences of children. 
Each school day, in classrooms all over the nation, work comes to a halt, and 
the teacher turns on Channel One -- a TV show with two minutes of commercials 
and 10 minutes of 'news.' Currently, the MTV-like show reaches about 8 million 
middle, junior high and high school students in about 12,000 schools. In these 
schools, students spend the equivalent of about one class week each year watching 
Channel One, including one full school day just watching ads. Channel One receives 
entry into schools in exchange for loaning each school two videocassette recorders, 
a satellite dish, and television monitors for each classroom. This is a disgracefully 
unbalanced and unnecessary exchange." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One doesn't belong 
in schools because it conveys materialism and harmful messages to children, corrupts 
the integrity of schools and degrades the moral authority of schools and teachers, 
exploits schools and compulsory attendance laws to coerce schoolchildren to watch 
ads, and wastes school time and tax money." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One is a Trojan 
horse. Advertisers use it to sneak commercial messages past parents and to deliver 
them to children -- in public schools. Many parents haven't ever heard of Channel 
One, don't know what it is, or whether it is in their children's schools." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Schools that show Channel 
One implicitly endorse the products that Channel One advertises. In effect, Channel 
One appropriates the authority of the school and teacher and transfers it to the 
advertisers. This degrades the moral authority of teachers, schools and the state." 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One's appropriation 
of the school's moral authority is wrong, but it is doubly harmful when the moral 
authority of the school is used to send destructive messages to schoolchildren, 
whether it is to purchase harmful products, or to develop materialistic values." 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When states require the 
attendance of children in schools, they bear a moral responsibility and a duty 
to care for the children, and to act in their best interests. This is a serious 
responsibility. The duty is a public trust. School boards, school administrators 
and teachers are public trustees. School boards violate this public trust when 
they coerce children to watch Channel One's ads in school -- particularly ads 
that show destructive influences and commercial messages." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Many schools are now met 
with fiscal emergencies, and educate children with crumbling infrastructure, old 
texts, and beleaguered teachers. This is a national tragedy. Public schools deserve 
adequate funding. But using the compulsory attendance laws to sell children to 
Channel One's advertisers is not a responsible answer to the problem of tight 
school budgets. A child's school time should not be for sale. It is not a commercial 
resource to be rented to advertisers or to the highest bidder. Nor should children 
be required to subsidize their own education by being forced to watch advertisements. 
They are, after all, only children. Their childhood deserves better than this." 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One's commercials 
are not educational. Children are in school to learn, not to waste time. But Channel 
One wastes class time not only because it contains advertising, but also because 
much of its programming has limited or no educational value." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One wastes tax 
money because it is shown in public schools, which are funded by the taxpayers. 
In effect, it is taxpayer subsidized advertising to children, which uses up school 
time that ought to be devoted to real teaching and learning." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Channel One is a taxpayer 
rip-off. Taxpayers are paying for the class time that Channel One uses to pitch 
advertising to children. Time is money. This waste of class time is a misuse of 
tax money. Any school administrator or school board official concerned about waste 
of tax money should work diligently to remove Channel One from their local public 
schools." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senators should stop all 
federal funds from being used to advertise on Channel One. The Federal government 
should extract itself from complicity in forcing children to watch advertising 
in public schools. The federal government should not be supporting a corporation 
that harms children, schools and taxpayers." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Local school boards can 
and should approve policies against Channel One and commercialism in their schools. 
It is very important for local school boards to take their responsibility and 
public trust seriously, and to make sure that Channel One is kept out of their 
school. This is an excellent education reform that protects children, schools 
and taxpayers, yet costs nothing." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"States ought to follow 
the lead of New York State, and ban Channel One from their school systems." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Non-profit organizations 
should cut their ties with Channel One. Channel One claims to be partners' with 
a number of organizations, including the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, 
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free 
Kids. Channel One uses these organizations as fig leafs camouflaging its commercial 
pursuits of these youngsters. These organizations ought to immediately disengage 
from any partnership' with Channel One." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"(W)e ought to use our power 
as consumers to convince advertisers to pull their commercials from Channel One. 
The CEOs of these companies need to take personal responsibility for their actions 
in support of Channel One. Following is an incomplete list of corporations that 
have advertised on Channel One during the months of April and May: M&amp;M/Mars 
(M&amp;M's, Snickers); PepsiCo Inc. (Pepsi, Mountain Dew); Gatorade; Twentieth 
Century Fox Film ('Never Been Kissed'); RJR Nabisco Inc. (Bubble Yum bubble gum); 
Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company (Juicy Fruit gum, Extra bubble gum); Procter &amp; Gamble 
(Clearasil, Noxzema, Old Spice); Kellogg Company (Corn Pops); Reebok International 
Ltd. (Reebok sneakers); and Foot Locker. We strongly urge parents to complain 
to these companies. Tell the companies that they should not be supporting Channel 
One. Eventually, if these companies do not remove their ads from Channel One, 
opponents may have to launch boycotts against some of their products." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's time for parents, 
school board members and state legislators, and Members of Congress to oppose 
Channel One. Channel One is harmful to children, schools, taxpayers and democracy. 
Students' minds should not be for sale or rent. And it is not the function of 
the public schools to deliver a captive audience of impressionable children to 
multinational corporations. Keep the moral authority of teachers and schools intact. 
The public schools are supposed to be a refuge, a sanctuary from commercial interests 
-- not yet another place for corporations to peddle their products, largely low-grade 
products."<br>
