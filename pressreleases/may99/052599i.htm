VA - May 25 - The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia filed suit today 
in Richmond Federal District Court seeking reinstatement of a Surry County High 
School sophomore who was suspended on April 28 for coming to school with his hair 
dyed blue. 
<p><font size="2"> The ACLU is asking the court to order the Surry County School 
Board to allow the student to return to school immediately and to provide a means 
for him to make up work lost as a result of the suspension. The lawsuit also charged 
that school officials refused to give complete assignments to the student so that 
he could keep up with his school work from home.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> Surry County High School student Kent McNew had been attending 
school since dying his hair blue last December. According to papers filed with 
the court, although there have been no incidences of disruption caused by Kent' 
s hair, Surry County High School officials suspended Kent under a new policy banning 
unusual hair colors. The policy was apparently adopted by the Surry County School 
Board in reaction to Governor Jim Gilmore's call for a crackdown on student expression 
in the wake of the tragic shootings last month at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colorado.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> In a letter sent to the parents of Kent McNew on the same day 
as the suspension, Assistant Superintendent Alvin W. Wilson wrote: &quot;The school 
administration has ruled that students who wear unusual or unique hair colors, 
such as blue or green, are to be removed from school until such time as their 
hair is a normal color&hellip;In view of the circumstances that have occurred 
recently, the governor expressed that unusual activities/appearances should not 
be ignored.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&quot;Schools should be safe places for everyone,&quot; said 
ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Kent Willis. &quot;The ACLU believes it is 
possible to make policies that effectively address concerns about school safety 
and still honor students' constitutional rights.&quot; </font></p>
<p> <font size="2">&quot;The Surry County policy, which is completely unrelated 
to school safety and clearly infringes on students' rights, ignores both of these 
important guiding principles,&quot; he added. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"> In a letter faxed to Wilson last Thursday, the ACLU asked the 
school to reinstate Kent voluntarily in order to avoid a lawsuit. Wilson did not 
reply. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"> A hearing on the matter has been set for June 3, 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&quot;Irrational policies unrelated to school safety or educational 
objectives, such as banning unusual hair colors,&quot; Willis said in the letter, 
&quot; create distrust of school officials at the very time we most need to have 
confidence their leadership.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The ACLU is filing the lawsuit on behalf of Kent McNew and 
his mother Phyllis Smith. McNew and Smith are represented by ACLU cooperating 
attorney Victor M. Glasberg of Glasberg &amp; Associates in Alexandria and Richard 
Ferris, Associate Director of the ACLU of Virginia.</font></p>

<DIV align=center></DIV>
<p><font size="2">May 20, 1999</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Mr. Alvin W. Wilson<br>
Assistant Superintendent <br>
Surry County Public Schools<br>
Surry County High School<br>
1675 Hollybush Road<br>
Dendron, Virginia 23839</font></p>
<p><font size="2">RE: Suspension of Kent McNew from Surry County High School</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Dear Mr. Wilson:</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> I am writing to inform you that the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Virginia is preparing to provide legal representation to Phyllis Smith 
and her son Kent McNew in the matter involving Kent's suspension from school because 
of the color of his hair. Lawyers for the ACLU intend to file suit in federal 
district court early next week, unless you permit Kent to return to school within 
twenty-four hours of the receipt of this fax transmission, with an appropriate 
agreed-upon plan to address the class work missed by Kent as result of his suspension.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> According to your letter of April 28, 1999, in which you inform 
Kent's parents of his suspension &quot;the school administration has ruled that 
students who wear unusual or unique hair colors, such as blue or green, are to 
be removed from school until such time as their hair is a normal color&hellip;In 
view of the circumstances that have occurred recently, the governor expressed 
that unusual activities/appearances should not be ignored.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> As you know, Kent and his mother attempted to strip the blue 
color from his hair, after which they met with you and sought Kent's reinstatement. 
Apparently, because the hair was still not a normal color, you refused to allow 
Kent to return to school. This left them with no alternative but to seek legal 
assistance from the ACLU.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> Please be aware that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has 
previously ruled in Massie v. Henry that public schools may not regulate the style 
of students' hair. In that case, quoting from Richards v. Thurston, the Fourth 
Circuit writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> We do not believe that mere unattractiveness in the eyes of 
some parents, teachers, or students, short of uncleanliness, can justify the [long 
hair] proscription. Nor, finally, does such compelled conformity to conventional 
standards or appearance seem a justifiable part of the educational process.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> In the same case, the Court also writes: </font></p>
<p><font size="2"> Perhaps the length of one's hair may be symbolic speech which 
under some circumstances is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment. 
But the record before us does not establish that the minor plaintiffs selected 
the length of their hair for any reasons other than personal preference. For that 
reason, we prefer in this case to treat their right to wear their hair as they 
wish as an aspect of the right to be secure in one's person guaranteed by the 
due process clause.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> The ACLU of Virginia believes that the U.S. Constitution protects 
Kent's right to wear blue coloring in his hair. We further believe that in these 
difficult times following the tragic events at Columbine High School, school officials 
should set an example for students and parents by keeping cool heads and calmly 
implementing effective programs to guard the safety of students in Virginia's 
schools. Irrational policies unrelated to school safety or educational objectives, 
such as banning unusual hair colors, create distrust of school officials at the 
very time we most need to have confidence their leadership.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> I thank you for your attention. I hope you will take immediate 
action to remedy this situation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Kent Willis<br>
Executive Director<br>
ACLU of Virginia</font></p>
