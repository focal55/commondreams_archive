    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">NEW YORK - November 10 - </font>Bill Clinton and Tony Blair should take
    all feasible steps to protect civilians from injury in the event of an attack on Iraq,
    Human Rights Watch said in letters to the U.S. president and U.K. prime minister today. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statements by officials from both governments have indicated that many
    potential targets are&nbsp; in urban areas, where the risk of civilian deaths and
    destruction is high.&nbsp; The laws of war prohibit the destruction of objects that are
    indispensable to the survival of a civilian population.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The laws-of-war duty to avoid damage to civilians requires
    extraordinary precautions in urban settings,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director
    of Human Rights Watch.&nbsp; He warned that&nbsp; attacks on electrical facilities,
    &quot;dual-use&quot; civilian facilities, and military sites in areas of civilian presence
    could result in disproportionate civilian losses. &quot;The Gulf War bombing of Iraq's
    electrical system is a good example of what must not happen again,&quot; Roth said.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human Rights Watch pointed out that U.S. and U.K. officials have yet to
    present evidence that they had been able to identify particular facilities as chemical and
    biological weapons (CBW) sites. Since many of the alleged CBW sites are civilian
    facilities such as hospitals, fertilizer plants, breweries, and pharmaceutical and
    pesticide plants, the potential for deadly mistakes is high. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The decision to attack possible dual-use sites must be taken only
    after all feasible efforts have been made to verify that the site is in fact being used
    for military purposes,&quot; said Roth. &quot; Even then civilians on site should be given
    effective advance warning of an imminent attack.&quot; The possible release of dangerous
    substances during an attack should also be weighed heavily, he said.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human Rights Watch noted that in the past, the Iraqi government has
    used civilians to shield its military sites -- a flagrant violation of international
    humanitarian law.&nbsp; But such actions in no way diminish the separate obligation of the
    U.S. and the U.K. to avoid harm to civilians. &quot;Knowing that shielding is a
    possibility, the American and British militaries should pay special attention to this
    obligation,&quot; said Roth. &quot;Advance warnings are imperative.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the U.S. and the U.K. have incorporated many international
    humanitarian law provisions into their military guidelines, the organization noted that
    allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War did not always fully comply with these requirements, as
    detailed in Human Rights Watch's lengthy report, Needless Deaths in the Gulf War.
    &nbsp; The organization called on both governments to put into place mechanisms to review
    continuously the selection of targets and the means and methods used to carry out attacks,
    and to ensure that possible violations of these standards are investigated immediately and
    vigorously. A prompt public accounting of the findings should be made, and appropriate
    disciplinary or prosecutorial measures should be taken against those found responsible for
    any breach.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization also urged the U.S. and U.K., given their special
    responsibilities as parties to this conflict, to use their influence to persuade all
    countries bordering Iraq to accommodate any refugee flows resulting from an attack and to
    refrain from forcibly returning such people to Iraq.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></p>
