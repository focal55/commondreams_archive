    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 12 - </font>Democracy 21 today strongly urged
    Republican Senators to oppose the effort of Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to serve as both
    chairman of the Senate Rules Committee and chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
    Committee (NRSC) in the upcoming 106th Congress.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It
    would be an inherent and blatant conflict of interest for Sen. McConnell to serve as
    chairman of the Senate Rules Committee and chairman of the NRSC at the same time,&quot;
    Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer wrote in a letter delivered today to Senate
    Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and all other Senate Republicans.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This is a time in our nation's life where there is a
    deep concern among our citizens about the standards and values that apply in our lives. A
    core ethical standard that applies to Members of Congress is the avoidance of conflict of
    interest and the appearance of conflict of interest,&quot; Wertheimer continued.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There is simply no question that for Senator
    McConnell to serve as chief party fundraiser and chief overseer of campaign finance laws
    at the same time would be a clear conflict of interest and a basic violation of ethical
    standards,&quot; Wertheimer wrote.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sen. McConnell is in line to be elected by Senate
    Republicans as chairman of the Rules Committee as a result of the decision by Sen. John
    Warner (R-Va.) to step down from that position in order to become chairman of the Senate
    Armed Services Committee, a position which is being vacated by Sen. Strom Thurmond
    (R-S.C.). The Rules Committee has Senate jurisdiction over campaign finance laws.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sen. McConnell is also seeking reelection by Senate
    Republicans to the post of Chairman of the NRSC, the party committee responsible for
    raising and spending funds to support Republican Senate candidates. The last time a
    similar situation occurred was in the1970s when Rep. Wayne Hayes (D-Ohio) chaired the
    Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the fundraising arm of the House
    Democrats, at the same time he was serving as Chairman of the House Administration
    Committee, the House committee with jurisdiction over the nations campaign finance laws.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As the Watergate scandal, and its enormous campaign
    finance abuses, exploded in 1973 and 1974, the Hays dual appointments turned into a
    scandal of its own,&quot; Wertheimer wrote. &quot;For almost two years, Hays put a
    stranglehold on even debating in the House any changes in the campaign finance laws while
    he filled the coffers of the Democratic party with campaign money. Hays abused and misused
    one of his positions of power to advance the efforts he was undertaking with his other
    position of power.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Since the Hays fiasco in the 1970s, no political
    party in either the House or the Senate has ever given one Member of Congress the dual
    jobs that Sen. McConnell is currently seeking of chief party fundraiser and chief overseer
    of campaign finance laws,&quot; Wertheimer wrote. &quot;Senate Republicans in 1999 should
    not make the same disastrous blunder that House Democrats made in 1973 with Representative
    Hays by allowing Sen. McConnell to serve in these inherently conflicting positions of
    power.&quot;</font></p>
