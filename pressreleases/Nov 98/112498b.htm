    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - November 24 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">A unique
    corporate-environmental alliance has produced an action plan that will help UPS
    dramatically reduce the amount of natural resources needed to make its express packaging. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The joint project, an eight-month review of UPS' packaging with the
    Alliance for Environmental Innovation, produced concrete, affordable changes for UPS'
    package production processes. Indeed, once fully implemented, the various changes are
    expected to actually save the company more than $1 million annually. A full report on the
    project is available at www.edf.org/alliance on the World Wide Web. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This initiative exceeded our expectations,&quot; said
    Elizabeth Sturcken, policy analyst for the Alliance. &quot;Together UPS and the Alliance
    were able to design practical packaging improvements that conserve energy, cut pollution,
    and reduce solid waste, while delivering better products for the customer and saving
    money. This is a win for the environment and UPS' bottom line, and an excellent example of
    business and environmental interests coming together on common ground and sharing
    expertise.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new packaging improvements announced today along with
    the reusable envelope introduced earlier this year will increase the use of post-consumer
    recycled materials by 22 percent, cut wastewater discharge by more than 15 percent and use
    12 percent less energy compared to previous UPS packaging. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;UPS already is seeing impressive business benefits
    from this environmental project,&quot; said Mike Herr, manager of Environmental Affairs at
    UPS. &quot;Beyond the cost savings, the environmental improvements are a reflection of our
    long-standing commitment to sound environmental practices. In addition, these changes and
    new packaging options have been eagerly accepted by many customers and are helping UPS to
    grow our business.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The packaging results announced today cut across the
    spectrum of UPS express shipping packages. They include: </font><ul>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nearly doubling the amount of post-consumer recycled
      material in the UPS box, and using at least 80 percent post-consumer recycled material in
      the Express Letter. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eliminating the use of bleached paper in all express
      packaging (lessening pollution of water from chlorinated compounds). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reducing overall waste and pollution from production of
      shipping materials by an average of 13 percent. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Introducing post-consumer recycled material into UPS'
      plastic PAK and reducing each PAK's weight by almost 10 percent. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Market testing reusable options for other packaging. </font></p>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, UPS has expanded its use of reusable packaging
    to include the A4 Next Day Air Letter. The A4 envelope is the standard envelope in most
    countries outside the United States &#150; ¾ of an inch longer than the standard, 9-by-12
    inch US envelopes. It is now available for US and overseas shipments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <a href="http://www.edf.org/Alliance/">Alliance for
    Environmental Innovation</a> is a joint initiative of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)
    and The Pew Charitable Trusts. The Alliance works cooperatively with businesses to reduce
    waste and build environmental considerations into business decisions. By bringing the
    expertise and perspective of environmental scientists and economists together with the
    business skills of major corporations, the Alliance creates solutions that make
    environmental and business sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">UPS is the world's largest express carrier and package
    delivery company, serving more than 200 countries and territories around the world.
    Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, UPS has been rated the world's most admired mail, package
    and freight delivery company by Fortune magazine, just six months after winning its 15th
    consecutive annual award as America's Most Admired transportation company. For more
