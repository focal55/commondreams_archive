    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 14 - </font>One day after a national environmental
    group released tests showing high levels of an organ damaging chemical in soft plastic
    children's toys, Toys 'R' Us, the nation's largest retailer of children's products,
    announced it would immediately remove teethers and pacifiers with the chemicals from its
    shelves in stores around the world.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Toys 'R' Us
    announced late Friday it would remove &quot;all direct-to-mouth products for infant
    use&quot; containing a chemical called &quot;phthalates&quot; from shelves worldwide no
    later than Wednesday, Nov. 18.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The company's announcement came one day after the National
    Environmental Trust, a nonprofit environmental organization, released testing data showing
    that 33 common soft plastic children's toys -- seven of which were purchased at Toys 'R'
    Us -- contained high levels of a chemical that has been banned or regulated in seven
    European countries. A growing body of scientific evidence suggests these chemicals cause
    liver and kidney lesions and other damage in laboratory animals and seep out of soft
    plastic vinyl when chewed and mouthed by a child.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The National Environmental Trust welcomed the step, noting
    in a letter from its president, Philip Clapp, to Toys 'R' Us Chief Executive Officer
    Robert Nakasone that &quot;a decision of this type so close to the Christmas season comes
    at some cost.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While stating that &quot;Toys 'R' Us deserves great credit
    for putting the health and safety of its customers first,&quot; Clapp stated that the toy
    seller's action was too limited. &quot;We strongly believe that limiting the scope of your
    action to just one class of toys -- infant toys intended for the mouth -- protects some
    children but leaves millions of others still exposed to potentially dangerous
    chemicals,&quot;said Clapp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Your company certainly knows what every parent knows,
    that infants and toddlers put everything in their mouths, often for extended periods of
    time -- and they certainly don't discriminate between 'direct-to-mouth'&nbsp; toys and
    other toys,&quot; according to Clapp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The National Environmental Trust revealed that of the seven
    Toys 'R' Us toys they tested, only one -- a Sesame Street teether ring containing 30
    percent phthalates by weight -- would be covered by the toy company's action. Each of the
    other toys with the chemical, including a Teletubbies doll from Playskool made of 17
    percent phthalates and a Little Pony doll from Hasbro made of 22 percent phthalates, would
    remain on Toys 'R' Us shelves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In his statement, Clapp claimed, &quot;While it's a first
    step, taking only teethers and pacifiers with phthalates off the shelves could give
    millions of parents in the U.S. and around the world a false sense of security by implying
    that the only toys they should be concerned about are toys intended for the mouth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Dr. Harvey Karp, assistant clinical professor
    of pediatrics at UCLA School of Medicine, &quot;I see dozens of kids in my practice come
    in every day with all kinds of soft plastic toys in hand that are bitten and chewed.&quot;
    Said Karp, &quot;Some of the children in my pediatric practice eat more plastic than
    broccoli everyday, and the phthalates in that plastic definitely gets into their
    system.&quot;</font></p>
