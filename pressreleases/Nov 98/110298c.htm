    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">BUENOS ARIES -
    November 2 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Greenpeace climbers this morning scaled
    the 70 metre Obelisk in the centre of Buenos Aires displaying their demands for
    international climate negotiations starting today in the Argentinian capital. The climbers
    entered Argentina's main nat ional monument and displayed a banner reading &quot;Save the
    Climate - clean energy now&quot; supported by five huge windmills which Greenpeace action
    teams had installed around the monument overnight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The protest comes at the opening of the United Nations
    Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which will continue until November 13th.
    &quot;The key question is whether governments will support renewable energy solutions to
    climate change or whethe r they will continue to pay lip service only and protect fossil
    fuel and nuclear interests,&quot; said Corin Millais, renewable energy campaigner with
    Greenpeace International. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There is a real danger here, that a thick blanket of
    jargon and details will pave the way for more coal, more oil and more nukes which will
    further delay the necessary phase-out of fossil fuels. We know already that we can only
    burn a quarter of the k nown fossil fuel reserves if we want to avoid dangerous climate
    change,&quot; said Millais. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">High on the agenda are the inclusion of forests which may
    absorb some carbon dioxide (CO 2), the extent to which industrialised countries can trade
    carbon emissions among themselves and the design of a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
    The CDM is supp osed to transfer money and technology to the developing world in order to
    improve energy efficiency, resulting in cost-efficient greenhouse gas reductions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But the CDM can be a new polluting tool. To be
    environmentally sound, it must supply massive support for renewable energy forms to meet
    the demands of the developing world. However, the mechanism can be abused as well,
    providing an option for industrie s to dump nuclear and fossil fuel power stations in the
    developing world. In the worst case, the United States for example could build nuclear and
    marginally improved coal power plants abroad which are not acceptable domestically and in
    return receive cre dits to increase their domestic CO 2 emissions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Greenpeace demands that the CDM is designed as an
    instrument to address the problem of climate change and not as an export subsidy for
    ailing industries in industrialised countries. That means support for renewable energy
    such as wind power and solar and no money for nuclear and misleadingly named clean-coal
    power plants,&quot; said Millais. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The concept of acquiring carbon credits by planting trees
    is equally problematic. While the general idea looks like a win-win concept, quite the
    opposite may be the effect. Under present regulations, the concept could actually provide
    an incentive for countries to cut down valuable old-growth forest, replacing it with fast
    growing eucalyptus trees. &quot;The scientific basis for an inclusion of trees into the
    protocol is simply not there and it does not tackle the main problem which is rising CO 2
    emissions &quot; says Bill Hare, head of the Greenpeace delegation in Buenos Aires.
    &quot;You don't start digging a well in your yard if your house is already on fire&quot;,
    said Hare who opposes inclusion of premature forest projects before a proper scientific
    assessment by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been finalised. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the conference will discuss how much of the
    reductions each country will have to achieve domestically. At present, the free for all
    trading schemes as proposed by the US could actually lead to further emissions of CO 2.
    They provide an incenti ve for some countries to inflate emission targets in order to
    convert the difference between real and projected emissions into hard currencies Russia
    alone could look at a windfall profit of several billion dollars if they trade their high
    allowance to th e carbon-hungry US. </font></p>
