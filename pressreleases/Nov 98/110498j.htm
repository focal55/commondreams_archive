    November 4 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">--Teleconference Scheduled for 2pm
    EST-- </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Resounding victories for comprehensive campaign finance
    reform initiatives in Arizona and Massachusetts have left voters reclaiming their
    democracy, and wealthy special interests scrambling. With all the votes counted, voters in
    Massachusetts approved Question 2 -- &quot;The Clean Elections Law&quot; -- by a 2-1
    margin with 66 percent of the vote in favor, while Proposition 200 -- &quot;The Citizens
    Clean Elections Act&quot; -- passed with 51 percent approval in Arizona. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Arizona and Massachusetts are now poised to join Maine and
    Vermont in offering candidates for state-level office a chance to break the hold special
    interests have on public officials through their campaign contributions. Both referenda
    provide an alternative system of campaign financing that gives all qualifying candidates
    who agree to take little or no private money and who agree to limit their campaign
    spending, a fixed amount of money from a publicly-financed pool. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The people of Massachusetts have spoken loud and
    clear; they want to end big money's dominance in the Bay State's election campaigns,&quot;
    said David Donnelly, campaign manager for Mass Voters for Clean Elections. &quot;The
    Massachusetts state legislature should listen to this overwhelming mandate from the
    voters.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Arizona is leading the way for national reform,&quot;
    said Kaia Lenhart, political director of Arizonans for Clean Elections. &quot;If sweeping
    reform can happen in a conservative state like Arizona, it can happen anywhere.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The impressive victories in Arizona and Massachusetts are
    consistent with a national trend in this year's elections; when offered the opportunity to
    vote for sweeping change in the way we finance campaigns, voters are not afraid to act.
    Victories for comprehensive reform in Arizona and Massachusetts were joined by the
    reelection of reform leader Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and the defeat of Republican Sen.
    Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, a well-known friend of big-monied interests, further
    demonstrating the resiliency of the reform issue among voters. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The victories in Arizona and Massachusetts for Clean
    Money Campaign Reform prove that voters have the political will to enact far-reaching
    campaign finance reform, whether they are liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican,
    business or labor,&quot; said Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It is now up to the reform community to demonstrate
    further that Members of Congress can be held accountable for not supporting the kind of
    sweeping reform measures the voters want.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The victories also provide strong momentum to local,
    grassroots efforts in other states working to bring Clean Money reforms to their own
    electoral systems, as popular support for comprehensive reform is as robust in other
    states across the country as it is in Arizona and Massachusetts. Missouri is slated to put
    Clean Money to the ballot test in 2000, while New Mexico will introduce Clean Money
    Campaign Reform legislation in January. In addition, at least 40 other states are working
    toward Clean Money reform, including Washington, Oregon and Wisconsin, as they continue to
    build and broaden their state coalitions and educate voters about the problems of money in
    politics. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Question 2 in Massachusetts, led by Mass Voters for Clean
    Elections, was endorsed by the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation, the first
    time any initiative received such endorsement in the Commonwealth. Former Governor Michael
    Dukakis, former Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Murphy, former state GOP chair John Sears,
    Common Cause Board Chair and former Harvard University President Derek Bok and former CEO
    of Stride Rite Corporation Arnold Hiatt all endorsed the measure as well. More than 6,000
    volunteers statewide worked toward the overwhelming victory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Arizonans for Clean Elections turned in 195,000 signatures
    to have Proposition 200 placed on the ballot -- 82,000 more signatures than needed to
    qualify. The proposition also enjoyed the broadest coalition of support of any referenda
    in state history, gaining the endorsement of the Arizona League of Women Voters, Arizona
    Common Cause, the state chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons and popular
    former Governor Rose Mofford. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Maine and Vermont passed similar legislation in 1996 and
    1997, respectively. Maine enacted it into law through a ballot initiative, Vermont through
    a vote in the state legislature. </font></p>

    working on behalf of comprehensive campaign finance reform. </font></p>
