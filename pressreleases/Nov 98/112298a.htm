    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 22 - </font>Since enactment of the Brady Law, crimes
    with firearms are dropping faster than violent crime overall.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, the use of guns in crime rose
    significantly from 1985 to 1993. However, since implementation of the Brady Law in
    February 1994, there has been a significant drop in the percentage of violent crimes
    committed with a firearm. According to a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
    242,000 prohibited purchasers have been prevented from taking possession of a handgun
    since the implementation of the Brady Law because of background checks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Analysis of the FBI data provides more compelling evidence
    that the Brady Law is working. The significant drop in the percentage of violent crimes
    committed with a firearm shows that, since all 50 states began doing the background checks
    in 1994, the Brady Law is working to make American safer from violent crime.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Compared to 1994, criminals in 1997 were less likely to use
    a firearm in the commission of a crime. Overall, the number of all violent crimes since
    1994 has fallen 14 percent (1,860,000 to 1,600,000). The number of violent crimes
    committed with a firearm since 1994 has fallen 25 percent (576,000 to 432,000). The total
    number of all aggravated assaults since 1994 has fallen by 8.5 percent (1,113,179 to
    1,019,000). The number of aggravated assaults with a firearm since 1994 has fallen by 23.7
    percent (267,163 to 203,800). A similar trend can be seen for robberies and murders. The
    number of all robberies since 1994 has fallen by 19.5 percent (618,949 to 497,950). The
    number of robberies committed with a firearm since 1994 has fallen by 22.6 percent
    (257,483 to 199,180).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, the number of all murders since 1994 has
    fallen 17.5 percent (22,084 to 18,209). The number of murders committed with a firearm
    since 1994 has fallen approximately 18 percent (15,463 to 12,746).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the Brady Law was implemented in early 1994 through
    the end of 1997, the overall proportion of aggravated assaults involving a firearm has
    fallen by 20.3 percent (25.1 percent to 20.0 percent). Additionally, the proportion of
    robberies committed with a firearm has fallen by 5.7 percent (42.4 percent to 40 percent).
    Firearms continue to be used in approximately 70 percent of reported murders, but, as the
    above numbers demonstrate, the overall number of murders has dropped dramatically.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The decrease in the use of firearms during robberies and
    aggravated assaults may help explain the overall decline in the murder rate. Injuries from
    firearms are more often lethal than injuries from other weapons; therefore, if fewer
    crimes are being committed with firearms, there would be fewer robbery- and
    assault-related murders.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of this progress may be reversed after Nov. 30, 1998,
    when the Brady Law's mandatory five-day waiting period expires, and is replaced with the
    National Instant Check System. Although the new system will conduct background checks on
    all long gun purchasers who buy from licensed gun dealers, not just handgun purchasers, it
    will also allow purchasers to buy guns instantaneously. Under the instant check system,
    many state and local officials will no longer participate in the background check process.
    As a result, some important state and local records will go unchecked, such as domestic
    violence misdemeanors, court restraining orders, minor drug offenses, outstanding
    misdemeanor arrest warrants, and some mental health records, among others. Additionally,
    there will no longer be a cooling-off period for people who buy guns to commit crimes of
    passion or suicide. The weakened background check and lack of a cooling-off period may
    allow some prohibited purchasers to elude background checks and may lead to an increase in
    gun crimes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Brady Law is a five-day waiting period for handgun
    purchases which serves as a cooling off period and allows time for local officials to
    conduct a thorough background check on gun purchasers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">------ The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, chaired by
    Sarah Brady, was founded in 1983 to reduce gun violence through education, legal advocacy,
    research, and outreach to the entertainment community.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Based in Washington, D.C., CPHV's national initiatives
    include prevention programs for parents and youth on the risks associated with guns, legal
    representation for gun violence victims, work with the entertainment community to
    encourage deglamorization of guns in the media, and research of the risks associated with
    guns and the efficacy of gun control laws.</font></p>

    organization, Handgun Control Inc., can be found on the website at <a href="http://www.cphv.org">www.cphv.org</a>.</font></p>
