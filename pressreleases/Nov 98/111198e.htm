    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">LONDON - November 11 - </font>Human Rights Watch today denounced
    suggestions by Augusto Pinochet's lawyers that the ex-dictator could be prosecuted in
    Chile. In arguments before a five-member panel of the House of Lords, which is ruling on
    whether Pinochet has immunity from extradition, Pinochet's lawyer Clare Montgomery stated
    on Tuesday that &quot;a forum is available to deal with the matter [in Chile].&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;There is no chance that Pinochet will be prosecuted by a Chilean court,&quot; said
    Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;This is a cynical ploy to get
    Pinochet back home where he can be shielded from justice.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    At least eleven cases now in Chilean courts raise the issue of Pinochet's culpability for
    human rights violations. But as a senator-for-life, a position he claimed as part of his
    bargain for leaving office in 1990, Pinochet is protected from such prosecutions.
    Theoretically, the Chilean Supreme Court could strip him of his immunity, if it found him
    guilty of criminal acts. But since the military left office in 1990, the court has never
    deprived a member of congress of immunity. <br>
    <br>
    If, by some miracle, Pinochet suddenly were indicted for his crimes, a military tribunal
    would surely claim jurisdiction in the case, arguing that Pinochet's crimes were committed
    as part of his military service. In past conflicts over jurisdiction, Chile's Supreme
    Court has readily acceded to such demands from the military. Military courts are staffed
    by current and former military officers whom Pinochet either promoted or appointed. <br>
    <br>
    In April 1978, the Chilean military granted itself a general amnesty from prosecution and
    punishment for its crimes, and in 1990, the Supreme Court upheld the measure's
    constitutionality. The amnesty covers the period when most of the worst abuses took place,
    from the coup in September 1973 to March 1978. The official Chilean truth commission has
    said that more than 3,100 people were executed or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the years
    of military dictatorship, 1973-1990.<br>
    <br>
    The Chilean government has touted a recent Supreme Court decision that the Geneva
    Conventions could prevail over the self-amnesty in one investigation of alleged war crimes
    committed by the military before 1978. But in the Chilean legal system, this single case
    does not&nbsp; establish any precedent for subsequent legal action. Indeed, in a later
    case, the Supreme Court again upheld the amnesty above international human rights law.<br>
    <br>
    Out of several hundred military officers who might be implicated in cases of serious human
    rights abuse, only three have been prosecuted. The 1978 amnesty expressly excluded the
    car-bombing murder of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and U.S. citizen
    Ronni Karpen Moffitt in Washington, D.C. in 1976. A U.S. grand jury indicted four members
    of Pinochet's security police, the DINA, including the agency's chief of operations Army
    Brig. Pedro Espinoza, and its director Army Gen. Manuel Contreras Sep·lveda, who reported
    directly to General Pinochet. In 1995, under strong U.S. pressure, both Contreras and
    Espinoza went to prison in Chile for the crime. In addition, one member of the military is
    in jail for an unrelated human rights crime committed in 1983.<br>
    <br>
    Even Pinochet's family members appear untouchable in Chile. In the early 1990's,
    government auditors were investigating Pinochet's son, Augusto Pinochet Hiriart, in a $7
    million corruption case involving military-run businesses. In May 1993, citing discontent
    over issues including this investigation, the army carried out a threateningly public
    military exercise in Santiago, the national capital. The then-government subsequently
    signed an agreement giving the army some power to monitor the Pinochet investigation.
    Under intense military pressure, the government of President Eduardo Frei was obliged to
    order the investigation closed in July 1995. Frei cited &quot;national interest&quot; as
    the reason for doing so.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font><br>
