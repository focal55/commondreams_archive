    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">LA HAGUE, FRANCE - November 9 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Greenpeace
    today announced that it had discovered high levels of aerial contamination in the
    surroundings of Cogema's plutonium reprocessing facility. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Greenpeace sampled the air at an altitude of between 60 and 120 metres and up to
    1km from the plant's main discharge stacks. These samples were analysed by the University
    of Gent, Belgium, and were found to contain over 90,000 Bq/m3 of the radioactive noble gas
    Krypton-85 (Kr-85). This value contrasts sharply with the world average radioactivity in
    air of between 1-2 Bq/m3. In a computer model developed by NOAA (Air Resources Lab.)
    Greenpeace showed that Cogema's aerial discharges contaminate the air throughout most of
    Western Europe, eventually this air moves around the planet. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A Greenpeace sampling team has been on site for two weeks
    to conduct a research programme into the aerial releases and consequent contamination of
    the environment by Cogema's plant. Using professional kite flyers and industrial-sized
    kites with samples pipes, Greenpeace was able to sample air at various altitudes and wind
    directions around the facility. After 11 days of training and tuning the equipment, the
    first sample was taken on Wednesday, November 4th. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Our first result is shocking, when it is considered
    that the background level is 90,000 less, but its only a small first step in trying to
    understand more about atmospheric contamination from Cogema's plutonium factory,&quot;
    said Diederik Samsom of Greenpeace. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Reprocessing is such a polluting industry that Cogema
    has turned the air radioactive,&quot; said Samsom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cogema is known to be the single largest source of aerial
    radioactivity in the world and is rapidly increasing its gaseous discharges. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last year Cogema discharged up to 300.000 TBq1
    (TeraBecquerel) of radioactivity into the atmosphere. This is an increase of nearly 500%
    in less than 8 years. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No data on levels of Kr-85 in the air has been made public
    by Cogema, their claims that they monitor extensively around the plant. However three days
    ago, two weeks after Greenpeace began sampling for Kr-85, the French Government Institute
    for Nuclear Safety Protection, (IPSN) distributed a preliminary paper containing figures
    on Krypton-85 contamination in the environment. The IPSN figures on Kr-85 contamination on
    ground level, confirm the worrying picture of large contamination levels in the air around
    La Hague. Greenpeace is calling for full public disclosure of aerial monitoring data for
    contamination around the Cogema plant and wider area. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Very little data has ever been published about
    atmospheric radioactive pollution from reprocessing plants. And yet millions of cubic
    metres of contaminated air is pumped out every day. Cogema is conducting a nuclear
    experiment on the environment and human health,&quot; said Samsom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Spent fuel from French nuclear power plants, as well as
    overseas clients in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Japan is
    reprocessed at the la Hague plant. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A dispersion model released by Greenpeace reveals how the
    discharged radioactivity spreads over large parts of Europe, covering France, UK, Belgium,
    Netherlands and Germany with radioactivity levels sometimes up to 100 times or more above
    background. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Those countries that dumped their waste on France are
    now receiving some of it back through atmospheric pollution. They are as responsible for
    this environmental problem as Cogema,&quot; said Samsom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It's clear that this dangerous nuclear cycle can only
    be stopped by ending reprocessing.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The French Government has announced that it intends to hold
    a public consultation for a new license for Cogema's radioactive discharges, and site
    license, but after more than one year there is still no date for such a process. </font></p>
