    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 9 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The
    National Education Association (NEA) expressed disappointment over today's decision by the
    U.S. Supreme Court not to review a controversial ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court
    allowing public tax dollars to be used for vouchers for private religious schools.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We had hoped the Court would review this case,&quot; said NEA
    President Bob Chase. &quot;Every day, the voucher plan does more damage to the Milwaukee
    Public Schools, and the city's taxpayers are paying the tab.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The voucher program has already stripped the Milwaukee
    Public Schools of $25 million in state aid, Chase said, and the city is now poised to
    enact a &quot;voucher tax&quot; -- in the form of increased property taxes -- to avoid
    program cuts and larger class sizes in the city's schools.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This year alone, the Milwaukee Public Schools will
    lose $25 million in taxpayer dollars to the coffers of private and religious
    schools,&quot; said Chase. Each of the city's 5,902 voucher students takes $4,894 in state
    aid from the city's schools -- even though only 1,379 of them ever previously attended
    Milwaukee public schools. &quot;That's just plain wrong, and it punishes every student
    attending the public schools,&quot; said Chase.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under state law, the Milwaukee Public Schools have the
    authority to increase the property tax levy to recoup the $25 million loss. The city's
    school board is now considering this so-called &quot;voucher tax,&quot; which would cost
    the owner of a $100,000 home an additional $141 per year.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chase also pointed out that the official study of the
    eight-year-old Milwaukee program showed no measurable improvement in academic performance
    among voucher students when compared with the city's public school students.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Vouchers will not 'reform' our public schools,&quot;
    Chase said. &quot;They will only serve to weaken them. Rather than spending precious
    public tax dollars on private and religious schools for a small group of children, we
    should be spending those same dollars on proven reforms that produce lasting educational
    improvement for all students.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chase suggested expanding the highly successful
    experimental program that has reduced class sizes for more than 2,400 students in
    Milwaukee's public schools for less than $5 million. Students in the smaller public school
    classes are academically out-performing voucher students and other public school students
    in reading.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There are many reasons why the Supreme Court might
    choose not to review a particular case, and whatever the Court's reason in this instance,
    it's important to note that it does not reflect agreement or disagreement with the
    Wisconsin ruling, nor does it have any precedential impact outside of Wisconsin,&quot;
    said NEA General Counsel Robert H. Chanin, lead counsel in the case.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last June the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-2 in <i>Jackson
    v. Benson</i> that Milwaukee's voucher program -- expanded in 1995 to include religious
    schools -- did not violate the state or federal constitution because it does not promote
    religion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The petition asked the court to review whether the
    Milwaukee voucher program violated the Establishment Clause of the United States
    Constitution, and specifically whether the Wisconsin decision conflicts with the Court's
    1973 <i>Nyquist</i> decision. In that case, the Court struck down a New York voucher
    program for low-income, private school students.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We believe the Wisconsin Supreme Court was
    wrong,&quot; said Chanin, &quot;and NEA and its affiliates will continue legally to oppose
    these types of voucher programs and any other efforts to use public funds for religious
    schools wherever they arise, on both state and federal constitutional grounds.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEA and its affiliates were among the primary sponsors of
    the legal challenge to the Milwaukee voucher program.</font></p>
