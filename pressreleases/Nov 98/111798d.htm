    Security was one of the top issues on the minds of voters as they went to the polls on
    November 3<sup>rd</sup>. But a <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/poll98/poll.pdf">new poll</a>
    conducted in the days immediately after the 1998 Congressional election demonstrates that,
    while the issue helped the Democrats in their good showing, over 85 percent of all voters
    thought that the candidates running for Congress <b>did not</b> do a good job of
    explaining to the public the changes they have in mind for &quot;saving&quot; Social
    Security.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The nationwide poll, conducted by
    International Communications Research (ICR) for the Institute for America's Future, found
    that strong majorities want Congress and the President to &quot;save Social
    Security,&quot; but, the poll had bad news for politicians and lobbyists whose idea of
    &quot;saving Social Security&quot; involves privatization. By a margin of almost three to
    one, Americans rejected proposals to create private accounts by diverting Social Security
    taxes while cutting guaranteed benefits and raising the retirement age to make up for lost
    revenue. Only 22 percent said such a plan would save Social Security, while 63.4 percent
    thought it would harm the system. Women, a key voting constituency for the Democrats, are
    especially skeptical about this approach to Social Security reform, with only 17.5 percent
    saying it would save the system and 67.2 percent saying it would be harmed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The poll's findings represent a cautionary warning to the
    leaders of the Republican party and to the President, who have declared their intention to
    seek a deal to make changes in the Social Security system this year. The poll shows that
    while Americans are skeptical about the debate so far, the future of Social Security is
    very important to them. Those age groups which most frequently cited Social Security as an
    important issue - those in the 50 to 64 and the 64 and older age groups - are precisely
    those Americans who are most likely to vote in upcoming elections. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Perhaps reflecting the view that the politicians have
    not leveled with the public about their plans for Social Security,&quot; said Roger
    Hickey, co-director of the Institute for America's Future, who commissioned the opinion
    survey, &quot;the poll shows that the public is in no mood to rush to make major changes
    to Social Security until they fully understand the implications.&quot; The poll found that
    87.9 percent of Americans would prefer &quot;to have the Congress and the President take
    the time to better explain the options before going forward with changes,&quot; while only
    8.8 percent support &quot;Congressional and Presidential action to address Social
    Security's long term solvency right away.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;In light of these
    findings,&quot; said Hickey, &quot;Congress would be well-advised to move slowly and
    deliberately to build a consensus for understandable and progressive reform. The poll
    results indicate a rush to drastic change could generate opposition from worried
    voters.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This caution is especially important for Democrats. Most
    voters, by a margin of 44 to 27 percent, trust the Democrats over the Republicans to
    &quot;save Social Security without unfairly cutting benefits or raising the retirement
    age.&quot; Among the youngest Americans surveyed, 18 to 34 year-olds, 50.9 percent trusted
    the Democrats to protect Social Security, while only 13.3 percent trusted the Republicans.
    Only among the 35 to 49 age group did the Republican Party come close to tying the
    Democrats, with 32.9 percent trusting the Republicans and 33.8 having more faith in the
    Democrats. Democrats should be very wary of supporting radical reforms, such as
    privatization schemes, that could undermine the trust the public currently gives them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The poll did show that Americans are prepared to make
    distinctions between complex plans. One question asked people to choose between two
    options: <u>Option A</u> would &quot;carve out&quot; a portion of each worker's payroll
    tax and divert the funds into private accounts, &quot;while making substantial cuts in
    guaranteed benefits to offset the reduced income to Social Security.&quot; <u>Option B</u>
    would &quot;add on&quot; private accounts by allowing people to &quot;make voluntary,
    tax-deductible contributions to private accounts, while their Social Security taxes go
    entirely to the trust fund, continuing to pay current level of guaranteed benefits to all
    but the highest income retirees. &quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Among all respondents, Option B, the &quot;add on&quot;
    proposal, was chosen by 55.3 percent, while Option A, the &quot;carve out&quot; proposal,
    was supported by only 29.6 percent. Interestingly, although the voluntary &quot;add
    on&quot; plan was supported by solid majorities over the &quot;carve out&quot; plan in
    every category of income level, age and education, support for the voluntary plan was
    especially strong among Republicans (at 60.2 percent) and among those earning over $50,000
    per year. This should perhaps come as no surprise, since the wealthy are more able to come
    up with voluntary savings, it nevertheless shows perhaps one way to a compromise plan for
    voluntary accounts that might be supported by all income groups -- even wealthy
    Republicans. Such &quot;add on&quot; plans have been proposed by former Social Security
    Commissioner Robert Ball, as well as by Robert Eisner, former President of the American
    Economics Association.</font></p>
