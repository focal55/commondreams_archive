    helplessness I see. I overhear horrible stories of the past week's violence as the
    children try to explain fresh cuts and bruises to their parents.&quot;</i></font> <br>
    (Mother of a boy at a juvenile correctional facility in Maine, USA. 1998) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thousands of children in the USA accused or convicted of
    criminal offenses are subjected to human rights abuses ranging from brutal physical force,
    lengthy periods in solitary confinement and long periods in jail before trial, to
    imprisonment with adults, a new Amnesty International report states. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the report (Betraying the young: Children in
    the US justice system) , many children are incarcerated for very minor offenses when other
    action could or should have been taken. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font><ul>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- a 10 year-old-boy handcuffed, arrested and locked up for
      allegedly kicking his mother; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- a 13 year-old-girl detained on suspicion of possessing
      marijuana, which turned out to be oregano, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- a 16 year-old-girl detained for transgressing her
      father's rules (throwing objects in her room and not attending school); </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- an 12 year-old-boy detained for making a harassing
      telephone call.</font></p>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In some jurisdictions, incarceration is regarded as an
    appropriate punishment for even minor infringements of the law by very young children,
    such as fighting in school. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Excessive use of incarceration is a matter of grave concern
    because of its inherent risks to the physical and mental integrity of children, and its
    potential for negative influence rather than rehabilitation. The harm that children suffer
    as a consequence of incarceration may be permanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the end of the last century, the USA was a world
    leader in the development of a legal system specifically for children, with a mandate to
    promote their welfare. Today, however, even within the juvenile justice system children's
    well-being is often placed at risk rather than being protected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many custodial facilities for children in the USA are
    overcrowded and unable to provide adequate mental health and other important services. In
    recent years, there have been many reports that staff in juvenile facilities have punched,
    kicked, shackled, sprayed with chemicals and even used electro-shock devices against
    children in their care. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An increasing number of children are being prosecuted as
    adults, often for non-violent offenses. Once in the adult criminal justice system they may
    be held for months in jail before they are tried, and they are often denied access to
    education, exercise and other programs. Over four thousand children are in adult prisons
    where they are notoriously at risk of physical and sexual abuse, as well as the corrupting
    influence of people with long criminal histories. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And at every stage of the justice system, racial and ethnic
    minority children are present in numbers greatly out of proportion to their numbers in the
    community. &quot;The evidence strongly indicates that one reason for this is
    discrimination on the part of law enforcement and justice system personnel,&quot; Amnesty
    International said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most disturbing aspect is that a number of the
    violations are actually sanctioned by US laws. In particular, the US executes people for
    crimes they committed when they were children, in flagrant violation of international
    standards. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Three such prisoners - all of them borderline mentally
    retarded - have been executed in the USA in 1998. Amnesty International knows of no other
    such executions anywhere else in the world during the year. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USA has executed nine juvenile offenders since 1990,
    half the known world total in the same period. The other nine executions were carried out
    in five countries -- Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Over 70 prisoners
    remain on death row in the USA for crimes committed when they were 16 or 17 years old. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USA has consistently refused to implement fully the
    protection of the human rights of children provided by international law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Children in the USA should be no less entitled to
    this protection than children of countries around the world,&quot; Amnesty International
    stressed. &quot;We urge the US federal government to ratify without reservations all
    international standards for the protection of children.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We also call on all US authorities to ensure that
    their laws, policies and practices are fully consistent with these standards,&quot;
    Amnesty International said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Definition of who is a &quot;child&quot;</b><br>
    Under international and national laws, 18 is the most common age below which special
    protection is deemed to be necessary and desirable for people accused or convicted of
    violating criminal laws. All international standards related to the death penalty define a
    child as someone under 18 years of age.</font></p>
