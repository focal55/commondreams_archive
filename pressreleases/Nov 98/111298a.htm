    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 12 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The
    American Civil Liberties Union today launched a special website aimed at provoking
    discussion over what constitutes public &quot;morality&quot; in America. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new web collection&nbsp;-- which can be found at <a href="http://www.aclu.org/morality">http://www.aclu.org/morality</a>&nbsp;-- includes an
    interactive survey, links to special faxable letters to Congress and the ACLU&#146;s new
    National Freedom Scorecard. Additional features will be added over the next several weeks.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The web collection is an adjunct to a year-long advertising
    campaign on the same topic that has been running in The New York Times and other
    publications since February. Each of the advertisements in that campaign&nbsp;-- all of
    which are featured as part of the web collection -- has contained a brief message from
    ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser on topical subjects ranging from the war on drugs to
    religious freedom to government intrusions in the bedroom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Some people may be surprised that the ACLU is talking
    about morality,&quot; Glasser said. &quot;But we believe it is crucial to counter the
    voices of people like Pat Robertson, like Jesse Helms and Pat Buchanan. They want to use
    government power to tell you how to live your life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;They've whined about the 'moral decay' of our
    society. They've said people shouldn't be allowed to make their own sexual choices.
    They've tried to have government force particular religious views down our childrens'
    throats in public school. And they've tried repeatedly to censor books, libraries and the
    Internet,&quot; Glasser added. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ACLU campaign is designed to encourage people to think
    back to the moral principles upon which our nation is founded: what used to be called
    'civic virtue' as opposed to personal virtue, which, Glasser said, is usually none of the
    government's business. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The ACLU believes that the morality of a nation is
    measured not by what occurs in the privacy of our bedrooms or doctor's offices or
    telephone conversations, but by how the government treats its people,&quot; Glasser said.
    &quot;Through this web collection, we hope to offer a vision of a world where it's safe to
    be different and easier to be free.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ACLU is a nationwide, non-partisan organization
    dedicated to defending and preserving the Bill of Rights for all individuals through
    litigation, legislation and public education. Headquartered in New York City, the ACLU has
    53 staffed affiliates in major cities, more than 300 chapters nationwide, and a
    legislative office in Washington, D.C. The bulk of its $35 million annual budget is raised
    by contributions from members -- 275,000 strong -- and gifts and grants from other
    individuals and foundations. The ACLU does not accept government funds. </font></p>
