    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 16 - </font>The following was released today by
    Fellowship of Reconciliation:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thousands of people
    across the United States are preparing vigils and actions to protest the threat of
    military foreign the Persian Gulf.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At least 30 actions are confirmed in more than 25 states,
    in addition to demonstrations in New Zealand, Norway, Canada, England and France. These
    actions represent the many Americans who abhor violence, and will vehemently and vocally
    oppose the North American use of force against Iraq. The Fellowship of Reconciliation
    (FOR), the oldest and largest interfaith peace organization in the United States, with
    more than 15,500 national members and supporters, and nearly half a million international
    members, serves as a national coordinator, sponsor and organizer for many of these events.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The FOR calls for the immediate cessation of war
    preparations in the Persian Gulf and an end to the unjust U.S./U.N. sanctions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Protest events will take place in the next few days in many
    cities including: New York City; Washington; Boston; San Francisco; Chicago; Honolulu;
    Philadelphia; Minneapolis; Worcester, Mass.; Bellingham, Wash.; Ann Arbor, Mich.;
    Gainesville, Fla.; Baltimore; Hartford; Concord; Memphis; San Jose; Portland; St. Louis;
    Lynchburg,Va.; Sacramento; Burlington, Vt.; Austin; Seattle;&nbsp; Harrisonburg, Va.;
    Tucson and Dayton.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> More Iraqi people have died as a direct result of the
    U.S./U.N.sanctions than were killed in the four-year war in Bosnia or the nuclear bombings
    of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We call on the United Nations and United States to show that
    they care about starving children, men and women, and lift the economic embargo, which
    according to UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricultural
    Organization, has contributed to massive sickness and malnutrition in Iraq. It is
    estimated that more than 1 million Iraqis have died since 1990 because of the sanctions.
    Eight years of economic sanctions and military strikes against Iraq have not worked.They
    are not a solution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The United States must show that it is concerned with
    preserving human life by not only lifting the sanctions, but working with Iraq and the
    international community to halt the construction of all weapons of mass destruction and
    chemical capabilities. If the United States wants Iraq to destroy these weapons systems,
    which indeed it should, the United States should take the lead by dismantling its own
    weaponry, which remains the largest arsenal in the world. While the FOR is deeply
    concerned with Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime, and his predilection for using military
    force, we must are equally appalled at our nation's acceptance of force as a diplomatic
    tool. Violence only begets more violence, and this new round of attacks will invariably
    solve nothing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The organizations sponsoring events around the nation are
    concerned with the loss of life that could result from this attack, adding carnage to the
    million who have already died from starvation and lack of adequate health care. These
    groups deserve a voice and media presence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The FOR, along with religious organizations and leaders,
    denounces these preparations for war. The FOR will hold a national press conference of
    religious and peace leaders at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. at 3 p.m. on
    Wednesday, Nov. 18 in the Zenger Room. Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, Bishop Thomas
    Gumbleton and FOR Director John Dear will be among the speakers.</font></p>
