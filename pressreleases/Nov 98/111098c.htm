    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - November 10 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">INFACT,
    the Boston-based corporate watchdog organization, is educating educators about the
    Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association/College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF)
    investments in tobacco giant Philip Morris. CREF--one of the largest pension fund
    investors in Philip Morris-- is holding its annual meeting today in New York. INFACT joins
    former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in calling on shareholders of CREF to divest
    tobacco stocks. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dr. Koop has already
    &quot;divested&quot; from Philip Morris by endorsing INFACT's Boycott of the world's
    largest tobacco corporation. &quot;By manipulating public policy in the interests of
    tobacco profits,&quot; Dr. Koop says, &quot;and by lying about the health effects of
    tobacco and the addictiveness of nicotine, the tobacco industry has for decades addicted
    customers around the world, especially children and young people. Until the industry
    ceases its aggressive marketing practices and interference in our democracy, consumers
    should apply economic pressure on Big Tobacco by refusing to buy Philip Morris' Kraft and
    RJR's Nabisco food products.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite 5% average annual growth in the US food industry,
    Philip Morris' Kraft has declined at a rate of nearly 4% a year since the Boycott began in
    1994. US food profits fell by 54% for RJR Nabisco between 1994 and 1996. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">INFACT representatives, some wearing cigarette costumes,
    will leaflet shareholders as they enter the building. INFACT staff will speak to the CREF
    board during the meeting. Elizabeth Bailey, who sits on both the Philip Morris and CREF
    boards, will be told that educators have no business profiting from corporations that
    market tobacco to kids, and that tobacco investment is bad business. The hand writing is
    on the wall: Fidelity, the largest mutual fund in the country, recently dumped 20% of its
    tobacco stocks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Dr. Koop's endorsement and Fidelity's divestment
    clearly increases the liability of investment in Philip Morris,&quot; says INFACT National
    Organizer, Sangita Nayak. &quot;The tobacco industry has closed off established avenues of
    reform through intensive lobbying, a $50 million public relations campaign, and a $50
    million 'family values' advertising campaign to enhance the image of Kraft products, like
    Macaroni &amp; Cheese. Joining Dr. Koop in the Boycott of Philip Morris' Kraft and
    divesting tobacco stocks will pressure Philip Morris to change its ways. Divestment is
    both sound business and a saving of lives.&quot; </font></p>
