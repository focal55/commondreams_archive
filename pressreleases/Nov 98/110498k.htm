    Marriage</font></strong></td>

    November 4 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Expressing disappointment over the
    outcome of state ballot measures to ban same-sex marriage in Alaska and Hawaii, the
    American Civil Liberties Union said today that it would continue the fight to ensure legal
    and social recognition for lesbian and gay relationships. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The referenda in these two states were closely watched
    during the elections because these were the first two states to come close to recognizing
    same-sex marriages, and because it was widely believed that the federal Constitution might
    require other states to recognize those marriages. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Hawaii, despite a fiercely fought battle, voters
    approved by 69-29 percent &quot;Question 2,&quot; a constitutional amendment to expand the
    power of state lawmakers to restrict marriages to opposite-sex couples. In Alaska, voters
    approved by 68-32 percent &quot;Measure 2,&quot; an initiative that would amend the state
    constitution to say that a &quot;valid&quot; marriage in Alaska can exist only between one
    man and one woman. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As disappointing as today's results are, it's
    important to keep this issue in perspective,&quot; said Matthew Coles, Director of the
    ACLU's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. &quot;Over the past 25 years, we've made
    incredible progress in getting governments, corporations, universities, and many churches
    to recognize lesbian and gay relationships.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Coles noted several recent high points, including a
    successful challenge to a Maryland ban on same-sex intimacy just last month, and, in late
    1997, an agreement with New Jersey authorities to allow lesbian and gay couples to adopt
    children on equal footing with married couples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, ACLU lobbying efforts this year helped to
    defeat a Congressional measure to deny federal funding to San Francisco because the city
    expects its contractors to provide benefits to the partners of gay employees. Opponents
    also beat back a Congressional attempt to ban lesbian and gay couples from jointly
    adopting children in the District of Columbia. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As long as our nation attaches a wealth of economic
    and legal consequences to civil marriages,&quot; Coles said, &quot;denying those same
    benefits to lesbians and gay men is nothing short of outright discrimination, and we will
    fight it.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Vanessa Y. Chong, Executive Director for the ACLU of
    Hawaii, agreed. &quot;This is so disappointing for a state that has a good civil rights
    record, but we knew it was going to be a difficult battle.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Our fight now moves to the state legislature to lobby
    for the extension of equal rights and benefits,&quot; she added. &quot;In the same vein,
    we expect to work with others to ask the State Supreme Court, despite this amendment, to
    extend all the rights and benefits to same-gender couples.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hawaii amendment reached voters following a landmark
    ruling in Baehr v. Miike, a case brought in 1991 by two lesbian couples and one gay male
    couple after they were denied their applications for marriage licenses. In 1996, a state
    trial judge ruled that the state had &quot;failed to present sufficient credible evidence
    . . . that the public interest in the well-being of children and families, or the optimal
    development of children would be adversely affected by same-sex marriages.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In response, state lawmakers agreed last year to let the
    voters decide on a constitutional amendment that would give lawmakers the power to
    restrict marriages to opposite-sex couples. At the same time, lawmakers reached a
    compromise plan that also would give same-sex couples a portion of the rights and benefits
    available to married couples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alaska's Measure 2 came in part as a response to a ruling
    in February in which a Superior Court Judge refused to throw out a challenge to a 1996
    state law that banned same-sex marriage. The judge in that case said choosing a life
    partner is a fundamental right protected by the Alaska Constitution. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lawmakers then introduced a constitutional amendment asking
    voters if same-sex marriage should be banned in Alaska. In July of this year, the Alaska
    Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project sued the state, saying
    that Measure 2 would radically alter underlying principles of equality and that it
    amounted to an illegal revision of the state constitution. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jennifer Rudinger, Executive Director of the AkCLU, said
    approval of Measure 2 represents a &quot;sharp break&quot; from Alaska's longstanding
    traditions of equality and privacy for all. &quot;Our whole system of government in
    Alaska, as set forth in the Constitution, is based on the fundamental notion that all
    people are entitled to equal protection under our laws,&quot; she said. &quot;It is very
    unfortunate that a blatantly discriminatory clause has now been added to a constitution
    that was one of the strongest in the nation in terms of its explicit protections for civil
    liberties.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of January 1998, bills banning same-sex marriage were
    blocked in 24 states; 25 states signed them into law. States that Passed Anti-gay Marriage
    Laws (25): Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois,
    Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North
    Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
    Utah and Virginia. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">States that Blocked Anti-Gay Marriage Bills (24): Alabama,
    California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
    Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode
    Island, Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;At this moment, gay men or lesbians can lose their
    homes to the government when a partner becomes ill, can be barred from intensive care
    units when their partners are desperately ill, or can lose everything when a partner dies,
    all because society refuses to recognize their relationships,&quot; Coles said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;One has only to think of the civil rights movement of
    the sixties to realize that change does not come all at once,&quot; he added. &quot;In
    fact, during this election nearly 40 percent of the electorate in South Carolina voted to
    reject a measure to finally remove from the state constitution a ban on interracial
    marriages. That should give us a little perspective on the battle before us.&quot; </font></p>
