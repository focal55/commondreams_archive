    year has passed since President Clinton promised to protect Americans' last scenic wild
    forests, but they remain unprotected--and a much-delayed Forest Service moratorium would
    give just some of them an 18-month reprieve from environmentally destructive roadbuilding
    in pristine areas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Today over 230 scientists, 460 conservation groups, and 40
    clergy or religious organizations-- altogether representing millions of Americans--will
    release a public letter to Vice President Gore urging him to step in and get the Forest
    Service back on track in developing a strong policy to protect America's remaining
    unprotected forests. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At stake are 60 million acres, or about 30% of the National
    Forest system--still wild and roadless, but still unprotected from logging, mining, and
    oil and gas drilling and the destructive roads those activities require. These are
    America's Heritage Forests. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Signers of the letter to Gore, still awaiting a temporary
    moratorium promised last January by the U.S. Forest Service, ask that Gore take advantage
    of this &quot;unprecedented opportunity to leave a legacy of Heritage Forests for future
    generations...[and] adopt a final policy at the termination of the 18-month moratorium
    that forever protects America's Heritage Forests.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The letter stresses the following: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">These scenic, unprotected wilderness areas provide unmatched
        opportunities for camping, hiking, and other recreational pursuits, valuable habitat for
        fish and wildlife, and abundant supplies of clean drinking water. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The interim policy explicitly exempts vast tracts of
        America's Heritage Forests located in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and elsewhere. It
        does not protect smaller, ecologically significant roadless areas, and allows logging and
        mining to continue in roadless areas. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Forest Service currently views the final policy (due at
        the end of the 18-month moratorium), as a &quot;roads policy&quot; on how new roads will
        be built into these roadless areas, rather than as a policy to keep existing roadless
        wildlands pristine. The Clinton-Gore Administration must take leadership in protecting
        such wild forest areas, and get the Forest Service to honor the White House commitment to
        our National Forests. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The temporary moratorium was supposed to be announced this
    week but still awaits review by the White House Office of Management and Budget. Continued
    delay has left forests that would otherwise be protected by the moratorium open to logging
    and road building. For example, the Dome Peak timber sale in Colorado's White River
    National Forest--which involves logging and road building inside an unprotected
    wilderness--could be awarded to loggers as early as next week. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(MORE) Last scenic wild forests still unprotected Page 2 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">President Clinton promised something quite different when
    he signed the Forest Service's 1998 spending plan on Nov. 14, 1997. In that statement a
    year ago he said: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My Administration has moved away from past policies
    that primarily emphasized timber cutting at the expense of the environment and blatantly
    violated environmental laws. This Administration stands for protecting the environment as
    well as jobs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;...the Forest Service is developing a scientifically
    based policy for managing roadless areas in our national forests. These last remaining
    wild areas are precious to millions of Americans and key to protecting clean water and
    abundant wildlife habitat, and providing recreation opportunities. These unspoiled places
    must be managed through science, not politics.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Polls show the public wants just that. The Forest Service
    has already received overwhelming public comments supporting the protection of our
    Heritage Forests (more than 95% of the 70,000 comments stemming from the January
    announcement support a strong policy to protect all roadless areas 1,000 acres and
    larger). Scientists have sent a clear message to the Clinton-Gore Administration about the
    necessity to protect all remaining roadless areas (169 scientists wrote to President
    Clinton last December asking for protection of all remaining roadless areas, and
    Wednesday's letter has been signed by over 250 scientists). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ken Rait, director of the national Americans for Heritage
    Forests campaign, an umbrella group for dozens of local and national environmental groups
    working on the issue, said: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;President Clinton has said that these areas should be
    managed by science, not politics and he is right. Unfortunately, the new Forest Service
    temporary moratorium is full of political loopholes that will leave tens of millions of
    acres of America's scenic wilderness wide open to logging, road building and mining. The
    loopholes must be closed and the moratorium made permanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;President Clinton and Vice-President Gore have an
    historic opportunity to protect these special places as a legacy for our children. They
    must ensure that the Forest Service uses science, not politics to develop the final
    policy. They must weigh in to make certain the final policy being developed by the Forest
    Service over the next 18 months will permanently protect all roadless areas of 1,000 acres
    or more from all destructive activities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The real test will come when the administration
    completes its final policy. Right now, the Forest Service appears headed in the wrong
    direction. If the new interim moratorium leads to nothing more than a new way to build
    roads in our last unspoiled forests instead of permanent protection of our remaining
    Heritage Forests, it will be a dismal failure.&quot; </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">America's Heritage Forests are at risk. America's Heritage
    Forests comprise just one-third of all the land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and are
    not permanently protected from logging, road building, and mining. These scenic,
    unprotected wilderness areas provide unmatched opportunities for camping, hiking and other
    recreational pursuits, valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, and abundant supplies of
    clean drinking water. The Clinton Adminsitration must implement a policy to permanently
    protect America's Heritage Forests, consisting of all remaining roadless areas 1,000 acres
    and larger (or smaller where ecologically significant), from logging, road construction,
    mining and other damaging activities. We have a responsibility to future generations. We
    must permanently protect our scenic Heritage Forests as parks and wilderness. Once they're
    gone, they're gone forever. </font></p>

    <h4><font color="red"><font face="Arial" size="2">November18, 1998 </font></h4>
    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="red">Dear Vice President Gore:</font>On
    January 22, 1998, the Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck announced an interim policy
    placing an eighteen-month moratorium on the construction of new roads in some roadless
    areas on national forest lands. This interim policy is the first phase in Administration
    plans for a comprehensive transportation policy for forest lands that will be developed
    over the course of the next 18 months. As a centerpiece of this effort, the Forest Service
    should adopt a policy that accords permanent protection to America's Heritage Forests,
    roadless areas 1,000 acres and larger (or smaller where ecologically significant), from
    logging, road construction, mining and other damaging activities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">America's Heritage Forests serve a variety of important
    public values. They are sources of our cleanest drinking water and some of our most
    important fish and wildlife habitat. They are a haven for the human spirit and a
    wellspring of future wilderness areas. By fostering permanent stewardship of our natural
    heritage, America's last untouched scenic wilderness will continue to provide spiritual,
    biological, economic, and recreational benefits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last fall, in his statement accompanying the 1998 Interior
    Appropriations Act, President Clinton said, &quot;(t)he Forest Service is developing a
    scientifically based policy for managing roadless areas in our national forests. These
    last remaining wild areas are precious to millions of Americans and key to protecting
    clean water and abundant wildlife habitat, and providing recreation opportunities. These
    unspoiled places must be managed through science, not politics.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On December 10, 1997, 169 scientists wrote a letter to
    President Clinton saying, &quot;(I)n our view, a scientifically-based policy should, at a
    minimum, protect from development all roadless areas larger than 1,000 acres and those
    smaller areas that have ecological significance because of their contributions to regional
    landscapes.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite this, on January 22, Forest Service Chief Mike
    Dombeck announced an interim policy that explicitly exempts vast tracts of America's
    Heritage Forests located in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and elsewhere. Additionally, it
    does not protect smaller, ecologically significant roadless areas. The interim policy
    allows logging to continue in roadless areas through helicopter timber sales and
    ground-based logging techniques that do not require roads, and does not protect roadless
    areas from oil and gas development activities, or motorized activity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although President Clinton announced a sweeping roadless
    area protection initiative, Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck appears headed down a path
    that will provide no permanent protection for our Heritage Forests, despite overwhelming
    public opinion plus Chief Dombeck's own observations to the contrary. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The American public understands the importance of
    protecting our Heritage Forests. A recent nationwide voter opinion survey conducted by
    Lake, Snell, and Perry and commissioned by the Wilderness Society found that 65 percent of
    voters support a proposal to &quot;stop all timber cutting in roadless wild forest
    areas.î In the survey, 68% of Democrats, 60% of Independents and 64% of Republicans
    supported a halt to logging in these areas. Similarly, 69% of respondents in the
    Northeast, 61% in the Midwest, 64% in the South and 66% in the West supported a logging
    moratorium in scenic, unprotected wilderness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck recognizes the importance
    of our Heritage Forests. In a July 1 letter to all Forest Service employees on
    Conservation Leadership, Chief Dombeck said, &quot;(v)alues such as wilderness and
    roadless areas, clean water, protection of rare species, old growth forests,
    naturalness-these are the reasons most Americans cherish their public lands... (T)wenty
    percent of the National Forest System is wilderness, and in the minds of many, more should
    be. Our wilderness portfolio must embody a broader array of lands-from prairie to old
    growth. As world leaders in wilderness management, we should be looking to the future to
    better manage existing, and identify new wilderness and other wild lands.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before you, Vice President Gore, lies an unprecedented
    opportunity to leave a legacy of Heritage Forests for future generations. We urge you to
    adopt a final policy at the termination of the 18-month moratorium that forever protects
    America's Heritage Forests, roadless areas 1000 acres and larger on all national forests
    (or smaller where ecologically significant), from logging, road building, off-road
    vehicles, mining and other damaging activities. With the dawning of the new millennium,
    this is the least we can do for future generations. </font></p>
