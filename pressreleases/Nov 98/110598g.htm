    Credit Card Survey </font></strong></td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 5 - </font>The banking industry is pursuing
    aggressive strategies to increase credit card income and push consumers deeper into debt,
    according to a new credit card survey released today by Consumer Action (CA). CA and the
    Consumer Federation of America (CFA) called on Congress to pass new consumer credit card
    protections and urged cardholders to take steps to avoid new charges.<br>
    <br>
    The CA survey of 117 cards from 74 banks, conducted in August and September by its staff
    members, revealed the following aggressive pricing strategies by card issuers:<br>
    <br>
    Increased use of penalty rates. Especially in the last year, issuers have sought to
    increase fee income by defining stringent payment conditions which, if not met, trigger
    penalty rates of up to 25 percent. These conditions are as unforgiving as making one late
    payment or exceeding the credit limit once. Of 31 banks surveyed with penalty rate
    provisions, default APRs ranged from 16.25% to 24.95%.<br>
    <br>
    Increased late fees. Many banks now charge late fees of $29. On average, 39 banks surveyed
    in 1998 and 1995 by CA increased their late fees by more than two-thirds during this
    three-year period. In 1995, late fees at these banks averaged $12.53. In 1998, the average
    has risen by nearly 75% to $21.82.<br>
    <br>
    Increased &quot;over the limit&quot; fees. These fees are typically at the same level as
    late fees, with many banks charging as much as $29. (These fees are charged monthly when
    an outstanding balance exceeds the credit limit.)<br>
    <br>
    Shortened grace periods. Most banks give cardholders 25 days from the closing of a billing
    cycle to make a payment without additional interest. But a number of banks have shortened
    their grace period to 20 days, thus increasing opportunities to assess late fees.<br>
    <br>
    Curtailed &quot;leniency periods&quot;-the time between the due date and when a payment
    can be received without incurring a late fee. Of 74 banks, 45 said they would impose late
    fees immediately if a cardholder's payment is not credited by the due date. In the past,
    many banks gave consumers from 5 to 15 extra days to pay without penalty.<br>
    <br>
    Lowered minimum payments-the portion of any outstanding balance that is due in each
    billing cycle. Nearly half the banks in the sample require a monthly minimum payment of 2%
    of the outstanding balance. The industry standard used to<br>
    be 4%. Repaying a $2,000 balance on a 15% APR card would take two years longer if the
    cardholder paid 2% each month instead of 4% (6.6 years vs. 4.6 years). <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Banks are pulling out all stops in order to increase profits from fee income,&quot;
    said Ken McEldowney, CA's executive director. &quot;If you make a couple of late payments
    on a card with a low introductory rate, your APR could jump 15 percentage points.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Banks are aggressively seeking to increase interest and fee income because they wish
    to reverse a decline in profit margins and because they believe most consumers will accept
    the price hikes,&quot; said Stephen Brobeck, CFA's executive director. &quot;Because of a
    saturated market and rising debt losses, bank card profitability declined from about 4
    percent in the early 1990s to about 1 percent today,&quot; he said.<br>
    <br>
    Another strategy pursued by card issuers is to increase indebtedness. They pursue this
    strategy through aggressive marketing of cards-e.g., more than 3 billion mail
    solicitations last year-and through aggressive credit extension. At present, banks have
    extended $2.4 trillion of card-related credit-more than $24,000 for each U.S. household.<br>
    <br>
    In the last congressional session, members proposed several new consumer credit card
    protections. For example, both Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-NY) and Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-MA)
    introduced legislation that would prohibit issuers from penalizing cardholders who paid
    off balances in full. And, Kennedy's bill would also limit the imposition of penalty rates
    and prohibit other unfair practices. The one protection bill that advanced-as part of
    Senate bankruptcy legislation-was a requirement that, on monthly bills, issuers disclose
    the number of months it would take to pay off the debt making only the minimum payment.<br>
    <br>
    The most effective strategy consumers can pursue to avoid the more than $60 billion in
    interest and fees they pay annually is to pay off outstanding balances promptly. Reducing
    the number of major cards to only one or two makes it easier to keep balances low and also
    to avoid fees.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></p>
