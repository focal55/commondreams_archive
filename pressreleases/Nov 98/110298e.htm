    November 2 - This is a statement of Jaydee R. Hanson, assistant general secretary of the
    General Board of Church and Society of The United Methodist Church:<br>
    <br>
    The General Board of Church and Society calls on United Methodists to fast in solidarity
    with farm workers, the day after Thanksgiving, November 27th. This one-day fast will call
    attention to the unfair wages and deplorable living and working conditions of farm
    workers, who toil in the fields picking the fruits and vegetables that we eat each day. It
    will also give us the opportunity to donate the money that we would have used for food to
    a farmworker organization of our choice. <br>
    <br>
    We recognize that the most fundamental needs of farm workers are the needs for dignity,
    for self-determination and for self-organization. Of working people in the United States,
    farm workers have consistently been among the most poorly paid, housed and educated. Most
    live below the poverty level and lack access to adequate health care. They have been
    systematically excluded from all, or nearly all, of the social and economic benefits
    enjoyed by other US workers. <br>
    <br>
    Immigrants, especially, migrant workers, face the brunt of legislated xenophobia. The US
    Congress tried to pass a new agricultural immigrant program that would have worsened the
    substandard working conditions that farmworkers already face. Although this attempt
    failed, we are certain that Congress will try again. <br>
    <br>
    For more than 70 years, the United Methodist Church has been in ministry with national
    farm worker support organizations. United Methodist policy on farm workers declares that
    the Church&#146;s most important role must be an advocate with and supporter of the
    efforts of farm workers. The teachings of Jesus calls us to show special concern for the
    poor and the oppressed. We have sought to improve the living conditions of farm workers
    and will continue to press for better educational opportunities, housing, a living wage,
    and full coverage by all social legislation for farm workers (Book of Resolutions1996,
    Special Needs of Farm Workers resolution). <br>
    <br>
    Fasting is an ancient religious tradition. The founder of the Methodist movement, John
    Wesley, fasted often and gave the money he saved to the poor. We call on all United
    Methodists to fast in solidarity with farm workers. Let us fast, pray and work for justice
    for the people who work to put food on our tables. </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">### </font></p>
