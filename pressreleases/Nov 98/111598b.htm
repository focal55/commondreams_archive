    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK - November 15 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The
    intention expressed by President Clinton in his November 15 speech to intensify efforts to
    overthrow the Iraqi government are both ominous and revealing. The Clinton Administration
    and the media frame the issue that as long as Saddam Hussein remains, the crisis&#146;s
    will continue. In truth, unless sanctions are lifted, the crisis&#146;s will continue
    because sanctions are genocide and are perpetrated against an entire people. The U.S.
    cannot expect to cause the killing of 8,000 children a month and have this not be a source
    of crisis and instability in the region,&quot; said Sara Flounders, co-coordinator of the
    International Action Center.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The sanctions are
    really part of an overall destabilization strategy. This same strategy has been used by
    the Pentagon and CIA many times in the past: from 1950 to 1953 against the elected
    government of Mossadegh in Iran, leading to its overthrow and the bloody reign of the
    Shah; in 1954 against the democratically elected government of Arbenz in Guatemala,
    leading to a U.S.-engineered military coup and the subsequent slaughter of over 100,000
    Indian people; from 1970 to 1973 against a democratically elected government of Salvador
    Allende in Chile which ended in the coming to power of the dictatorship of General
    Pinochet and the murder of 30,000 Chileans. The U.S. policy of economic destabilization
    and overthrow in Iraq will not lead to a democratic government, but rather to a
    dictatorship compliant to U.S. bidding, as has been shown time and again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Hundreds of protests were in place within days of
    U.S. threats to bomb. <b>The International Action Center is continuing with its plans for
    a Nationally and Internationally coordinated day of protest on Tuesday, November 17.</b>
    On this day, protests around the country and around the world will demand an immediate end
    to genocidal sanctions and the withdraw of the massive U.S. military forces that are now
    occupying the Gulf region. (For a listing of demonstrations, refer to our web page.) As
    long as these forces remain in the region there is an ever-present danger of new bombing
    attacks. At its worst, the Iraqi decision to expel foreign inspectors -- after 8 long
    years and 9,000 inspections -- is an act of sovereignty. In no way can it be construed as
    an act of aggression against another country. The U.S. is claiming that Iraq is isolated,
    but, in fact, the only thing that deterred an attack is that the U.S. became isolated in
    its policy. The U.S. is more isolated in growing world opposition to both a military
    strike and the continuing of the deadly sanctions</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;People will continue to be in the streets because
    genuine peace and justice in the Gulf region requires the withdraw of the massive U.S.
    military forces now deployed in the region, an end to destabilization, and an end to the
    genocidal sanctions. The issue of sanctions which the U.S. has kept silent for eight years
    is now a crime that millions of people all over the world oppose,&quot; continued
    Flounders.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The New York City demonstration will be on Tuesday,
    November 17 at 5 PM at Grand Central Station (42<sup>nd</sup> St. and Park Ave.).</font></b></p>
