    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    November 4 - Following is a statement by House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt and DCCC
    Chair Martin Frost:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In an election year that has been
    anything but ordinary, one thing is clear: the Democratic issue agenda has delivered us a
    historic victory in 1998 and put us on the path to regaining control of the House in 2000.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Newt Gingrich and his pro-impeachment agenda have been
    soundly rejected by American voters, granting House Democrats the mandate and the momentum
    to propel us into legislative action and into a New Majority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Millions of dollars in special interest money funneled
    through the Republican Party left Democrats outspent by a mind-boggling $110 million. In
    the face of Republican attacks on the airwaves, in the mail and on the ground, Democrats,
    for the first time this century, won seats in the sixth year of an incumbent presidency.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">House Democrats have made history in a complicated
    environment for very simple reasons:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">-- Unwavering pursuit of an issues agenda that speaks to
    the real concerns of American families, like better schools for their children, a health
    car system that puts patients first, and a Social Security system they can count on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">-- Unified and disciplined dedication to that message and
    to along-term election year plan in the face of every imaginable GOP attempt to divert the
    public dialogue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">-- Top tier candidates ideologically in tune with their
    districts who got in early, raised money and ran top-notch campaigns. National Republican
    money and spin simply could not prop up their second-rate recruits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">-- Unprecedented turnout efforts both on the ground and on
    the radio, boosted by the participation of our Caucus financially and on the stump, and
    reaching out to all our core constituencies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The strength of Democratic ideas and candidates has further
    reduced what was already the narrowest margin in the House in over 40 years, putting
    Democrats squarely on track to take back the House in the next cycle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This year we made remarkable gains in Republican open
    seats. In 2000, self-imposed Republican term limits and departures brought on by GOP House
    Members forced to relinquish their Committee posts and choosing to seek higher office,
    will once again create a landscape ripe for Democratic pick-ups in GOP open seats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With Democrats on the precipice of regaining the majority,
    quality Democratic candidates can be expected to energy quickly in vulnerable GOP
    districts and likely GOP open seats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as 1998's gains can be attributed to the high caliber
    of our recruits, so will 2000'svictories be attained by a new round of outstanding
    candidates encouraged to run by the public's overwhelming endorsement of Democratic core
    ideals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Through 1997 and 1998, internal divisions wracked the
    Republican Party, resulting in the last-ditch, misguided attempt by Newt Gingrich to
    stimulate Republican base voters with a barrage of pro-impeachment advertising. That
    disarray and inability to coherently articulate a positive message can only be expected to
    heighten in the 2000 cycle, as finger pointing and Presidential-yea posturing explode
    within the GOP, pushing Party members as a whole further to the right and more at odds
    with each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since winning the majority in 1994, Republicans, led by
    Newt Gingrich, have embarked on an unswerving path of self-destruction. They tried to
    force an extremist legislative agenda on the American people and were rebuffed in 1996.
    They again ignored the interests of voters in 1998 and were again punished at the polls.
    They have spent hundreds of millions of special interest dollars trying to sell a bridge
    to nowhere, but the American public is not buying.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again in 1998 Democrats have proven that the most important
    ingredient in any political recipe is people. By finding and supporting the individual
    candidates best suited to fight for American families' interests, Democrats have made
    historic gains in 1998, ushered in a new class of diverse and talented Freshmen, and
    positioned themselves for an inevitable take over of the House in 2000.</font></p>
