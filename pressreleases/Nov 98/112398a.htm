    methyl bromide, global warming &amp; lack of controls on new ozone depleting substances
    still major concerns</i></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">CAIRO - November 23 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">In a year marked by the largest-ever ozone hole in the Southern
    Hemisphere and predictions from scientists that depletion will worsen through the coming
    decades, delegates to the 10th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol are taking
    insufficient action to counter the crisis, warned three environmental groups. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The meeting has faced the emergency in the atmosphere
    with lethargy,&quot; said Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and Ozone Action
    representatives, in a joint statement released today. &quot;The agents of ennui are
    predictable: representatives of power chemical industries, who fill several long rows of
    seats in the meeting room, are working hard to protect their investments in
    chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC),
    methyl bromide, and new ozone depleting chemicals that continue to flood the marketplace
    and the atmosphere. On many issues, government representatives, led by the U.S.
    delegation, are marching in step with the industrial lobby.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The groups highlighted four critical issues treated gently
    by this meeting: </font><ul>
      <b>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal
        Protocol continues hypocritical funding of projects that consume HCFCs and potent global
        warming HFCs as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons in developing countries.</font></b></li>
    </ul>
    <dir>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It is totally unacceptable that the relatively paltry
      resources of the Multilateral Fund are being squandered on substances which will
      exacerbate our atmospheric crisis when environmentally safer technologies for meeting
      human needs are available in nearly all sectors,&quot; said Mr. John Mate, representative
      of Greenpeace International. &quot;This is an example of industrialized countries
      promoting technologies in developing countries which will soon be considered as obsolete
      in their home markets, due to their use of substances which are to be phased-out or
      limited under the terms of the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Science has established a firm link between global warming
      and prolonged ozone layer depletion. It is estimated that global warming will delay the
      beginning of the recovery of the ozone layer by at least 20 years, resulting in
      significant increases in dangerous ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth.</font></p>
    </dir>
    <ul>
      <b>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Montreal Protocol still has a gaping loophole that
        allows the unlimited and perpetual use of methyl bromide for &quot;quarantine and
        pre-shipment&quot; (QPS) purposes. </font></li>
    </ul>
    </b><dir>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The United States, which produces over 40% of the world's
      methyl bromide (a powerful depleter of the ozone layer, destroying ozone 50 times more
      aggressively than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) pound for pound), moved to strike language
      that would have led to limits on this exemption. Delegates argued that the chemical is
      needed to stop the invasion of foreign pests that travel in shipping pallets, such as a
      Chinese beetle that is devouring trees in Chicago and New York. A U.S. delegate in Cairo
      said, &quot;The QPS is sacred.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The U.S. delegation has used the Asian Longhorned
      Beetle crisis to justify a completely unnecessary loophole in national and international
      law that ensures a long-term market for the methyl bromide industry,&quot; said Ms.
      Jessica Vallette, representative of Friends of the Earth International. &quot;The U.S.
      Department of Agriculture has admitted that effective and safer alternatives exist to
      combat the invasion of foreign pests.&quot;</font></p>
    </dir>
    <ul>
      <b>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a lack of any controls on new ozone depleting
        substances. </font></b></li>
    </ul>
    <dir>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Montreal Protocol currently does nothing to prevent the
      entry of any new ozone depleting substances into the global marketplace. Three major
      methyl bromide producers - Great Lakes Chemical, Albemarle, and Dead Sea Bromine - have
      begun marketing two new ozone depleting substances (n-propyl bromide and
      chlorobromomethane). While the Parties decided to &quot;discourage&quot; the promotion of
      chlorobromomethane, they failed to place any moral force behind the need to limit the use
      of n-propyl bromide. This meeting agreed only to study the problem for the next two years.</font></p>
    </dir>
    <ul>
      <b>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">CFC production continues with the dumping of old
        CFC-dependent refrigerators, air conditioners and other equipment in developing countries.
        </font></b></li>
    </ul>
    <dir>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many factories in Europe, the Americas, and Asia are
      churning out CFCs at a rate more than double that originally predicted by Protocol
      policy-makers. At the same time, old CFC-dependent equipment unwanted in Europe and N.
      America is pouring into developing countries. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The death of the CFC industry is taking much longer
      than the policymakers had assured us,&quot; said Mr. Jim Vallette, representative of Ozone
      Action. &quot;Ironically, Western companies, which are producing over 30,000 tons of CFCs
      a year, and are dumping hundreds of thousands of old refrigerators and air conditioners in
      developing countries, are trying to blame the Chinese and Indians for the problem they
      continue to perpetuate.&quot;</font></p>
    </dir>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The bulk of the negotiations for this meeting have been
    completed. A largely symbolic Ministerial-level meeting will take place at the Cairo
    International Conference Centre on November 23 and 24. <a href="http://www.ozone.org/cairo.html">A more detailed background paper on the
    negotiations is available.</a></font></p>
