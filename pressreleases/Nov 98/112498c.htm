    Protection Act, hazardous toys can still be found on toy store shelves across the country,
    according to a nationwide toy safety survey released today by the U.S. Public Interest
    Research Group (U.S. PIRG). While the group's 13th annual survey noted some signs of
    improvement for safer toys, there were still 13 toy deaths in 1997 from unsafe toys. For
    the first time, the report includes a number of plastic PVC teething toys posing toxic
    hazards from phthalates. </font></tt><p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Children are
    still needlessly choking to death on toys and dangerous toys can still be found on toy
    shelves,&quot; said Edmund Mierzwinski, Consumer Program Director. &quot;Our thirteenth
    national survey of toy stores finds that the number of toy hazards appears to be declining
    and the vast majority of toys finally include tough new choke hazard warnings that will
    help prevent future deaths. But parents must remember that the government does not test
    all toys. Just because a toy appears on the shelf, or fails to appear on PIRG&#146;s list,
    doesn't mean it is safe,&quot; he added. </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">The annual PIRG &quot;Trouble in Toyland&quot; report
    lists 24 dangerous toys discovered during a survey of toy stores across the country. At
    least 5 of the toys violate the Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC) small parts
    standard designed to prevent choking deaths. Four toys violate the CPSC's new small ball
    regulations. Other toys narrowly evade the small parts standard, but still pose choking
    and other hazards. The annual PIRG reports have resulted in 50 recalls and other
    enforcement actions in the last 13 years. </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">The PIRG report highlights the choking hazards
    associated with toys. Federal regulations ban any toy that poses a choking hazard because
    of small parts if it has &quot;play value&quot; for children under the age of three,
    regardless of any age labeling to the contrary. The group also warned parents of the
    choking hazards associated with balls. The 1994 Child Safety Protection Act banned the
    sale of small balls with a diameter of less than 1.75 inches for sale for children under
    three. </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Tragically, children choke to death on balls that
    are small enough to be put in the mouth and obstruct the airway,&quot; added Mierzwinski.
    &quot;Unfortunately, ball-shaped objects, such as toy plastic fruits and vegetables, which
    pose the same hazards as balls, are not treated as balls by the CPSC,&quot; added
    Mierzwinski. </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">Choking on small toy parts, balloons and small balls
    continues to be the leading cause of toy- related deaths. According to the Consumer
    Product Safety Commission (CPSC), at least 160 children died from 1990 to 1997 playing
    with toys. In 1997 alone, 13 children died playing with toys, 11 of those from choking. In
    1997, an estimated 141,300 persons were treated in hospital emergency rooms for
    toy-related injuries. Nearly half, 65,400, were under 5 years old. One tragic example from
    this year's statistics was a 2 year old who choked on a small plastic game piece. A
    5-month old child choked to death on a balloon piece. Forty-eight children have choked to
    death on balloons since 1990. PIRG criticized retailers for marketing balloons for events
    for young children, having found balloons that read, for example, &quot;Baby's 1st
    Birthday.&quot; </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Balloons are the leading choking killer,&quot;
    added Mierzwinski. &quot;It is totally inappropriate to market balloons for
    toddlers,&quot; Mierzwinski said. &quot;We urge parents to avoid balloons altogether for
    children under 8, and even then to use extreme caution.&quot; </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">For the first time, the report also focused on the
    growing hazard of toys containing toxic chemicals known as phthalates that are added to
    polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic toys as a softener. The chemicals are linked to liver and
    kidney damage, are probable human carcinogens, and have already been banned by several
    European countries in toys for children under 3 because exposure to toxic chemicals is
    especially dangerous to small children. On Thursday, 19 November, PIRG joined other
    leading consumer and environmental groups in a formal petition to the CPSC calling for a
    for a ban on PVC in all toys intended for children under 5, to ensure that children are
    protected from all hazards related to PVC plastics. For more information on this campaign,
    see the <a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/features/featuressection.html?/features/vinyltoys.htm">Greenpeace
    page</a> .</font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It is outrageous that a scientist who buys a
    bottle of phthalate chemicals receives a full hazard warning, but a mother buying a
    teething toy with phthalates often finds it labeled non-toxic,&quot; added Mierzwinski.
    &quot;Young children should not be chewing on toxic toys.&quot; </font></tt></p>
    <p><tt><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Shoppers should examine toys carefully for hidden
    dangers before they make a purchase,&quot; Mierzwinski added. &quot;While most
    manufacturers should be commended for complying with the new law, parents should not
    assume that all toys on store shelves this holiday shopping season are safe or adequately
    labeled,&quot; continued Mierzwinski. &quot;We wish everyone happier, and safer, holidays
    and are encouraged that it is not all Trouble In Toyland. &quot; </font></tt></p>
