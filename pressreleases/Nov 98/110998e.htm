    this Thanksgiving--you might miss all the action.<br>
    <br>
    For one week--from November 27 through December 4--activists from hundreds of
    organizations across the United States and as far away as South Africa will focus on the
    needs of young people in an increasingly violent world. International YouthPeace Week is a
    global celebration of local initiatives by youth activists and advocates.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Fine establishments in shopping districts everywhere may find themselves beset upon by
    highly organized and flamboyant bands of young people at the beginning of the holiday
    season.&nbsp; No peddlers of war toys or garments produced by sweatshop labor can consider
    themselves safe from a sales-draining leafleting.<br>
    <br>
    Or local police departments with reputations for systemic abuses could be set back on
    their heels by a citizens march calling for an end to the criminalization of our youth.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are tired of being preyed upon by military recruiters in our schools, as youth
    around the world are pressed into military service through forced conscription,&quot; said
    Derrick Francis, a young activist with YouthPeace and Global Kids in New York City.
    &nbsp; &quot;We are demanding real opportunities for our lives that don't involve
    mortgaging our futures to the military or the student loan providers.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Now in its third year, International YouthPeace Week is a dynamic coalition effort
    coordinated by the War Resisters League, the pacifist organization that spearheaded
    October 19th's &quot;Day Without the Pentagon&quot; demonstration in Washington, DC, at
    which 39 people were arrested.&nbsp; YouthPeace is energized by young people and their
    advocates who are outraged by the frightening increase in the ways that violence
    disrupts--and sometimes ends--the lives of our youth.&nbsp; For further information,
    contact the YouthPeace program at 212-228-0450, fax 212-228-6193, e-mail <a href="mailto:wrl@igc.org">wrl@igc.org</a>.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"># # # </font></p>

    <br>
    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON INTERNATIONAL YOUTHPEACE WEEK<br>
    <br>
    1. What is International YouthPeace Week?<br>
    <br>
    International YouthPeace week, held November 27 to December 4, 1998 is a global
    celebration of local initiatives by youth activists and advocates. This week was chosen to
    provide an annual platform for world-wide issues affecting children and youth through a
    coalition effort.&nbsp; This is the third year that the message and time of the
    International Days to Protest War Toys,&nbsp; which have been held the first two days
    after the US Thanksgiving holiday, was&nbsp; expanded to give more time to protest the
    violence in young lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; International YouthPeace Week is an opportunity for
    organizations and&nbsp; individuals to work, through educational activities and political
    action, to&nbsp; make peace and justice a part of every young person's life.<br>
    <br>
    2. What is the purpose of celebrating International YouthPeace Week and what are the
    issues involved in this observance?<br>
    <br>
    A broad range of organizations and individuals who share the War Resisters League's
    opposition to war and all its causes that impact our urban centers and rural
    regions-oppression, imperialism, domestic domination and neglect, genocide and economic
    warfare-are called on to celebrate the enduring spirit of our youth while engaging in
    dynamic nonviolent activism as youth activists or advocates.<br>
    <br>
    The international community is asked to support the recommendations of the Graca Machel
    study on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children and to &quot;encourage Governments to
    reduce their levels of militarization and to honor the commitments they made at the World
    Summit for Development to support the concept of human security by taking steps to shift
    the allocation of resources from arms and military expenditures to human and social
    development.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Adopting the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child would mean
    that all governments would raise the age of enlistment to eighteen and end the forced
    military service of children and their participation in armed conflict. International
    YouthPeace Week is also a chance to work against child labor and demand sustainable
    development which will provide safe environments for all young people throughout the
    world.<br>
    <br>
    If you are an organization or individual that believes in working in coalition with others
    who are committed to social change through nonviolent action, it is imperative that you
    participate in International YouthPeace Week. National and international alternatives to
    the militarization of youth can be shared with new audiences during this week of
    YouthPeace programs and actions.<br>
    <br>
    3. What does sponsorship or endorsement of International YouthPeace Week require?<br>
    <br>
    Sponsorship means actively engaging in the act of YouthPeace by hosting a program or
    developing an action, sharing the message through mailings and other medium to your
    membership and affiliates. Sponsorship also means serving as a resource for other groups
    regarding International YouthPeace Week.<br>
    <br>
    Endorsement of International YouthPeace Week means lending your name to this important
    endeavor and publicizing it whenever possible. Endorsers are also asked to attend and
    promote International YouthPeace Week activities taking place in your area and participate
    in the petition drives attached to several of the issue areas.<br>
    <br>

    Week?<br>

    5. Demanding an end to Child Labor by protesting companies who use children as a labor
    force<br>
    6. Insisting that children stop being forced into armed conflict by having all governments
    adopt the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child<br>
    7. Creating forums to educate communities about the environmental hazards caused by
    nuclear and industrial waste.<br>
    <br>

    education, etc.) during International YouthPeace Week.<br>
    <br>
    5. What are the activities and programs choices for organizations or individuals who
    engage in International YouthPeace Week?<br>

    exhibitions, theaters, wherever spoken word events are held, in schools, churches and the
    streets.<br>
