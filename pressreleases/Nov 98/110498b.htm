    non-incumbent, out gay and lesbian candidates Tammy Baldwin, Paul Barby, Grethe
    Cammermeyer, and Christine Kehoe; key House and Senate races; and gay-related ballot

    margin is 68% for; 29% against. In Alaska, 60% of the precincts are counted, with a margin
    of 68% for; 32% against. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(68% for, 29% against; 63% reporting) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hawaii ballot initiative likely will lead to a ban on
      same-sex marriage. Voters cast ballots on two initiatives. The first would amend the
      state's constitution to empower the legislature to reserve marriage to opposite sex
      couples. The second would call for a constitutional convention to be convened - where an
      explicit anti-gay marriage ban could be mandated. In a 1996 ruling, a Hawaii court ruled
      that there is no valid reason for denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry. The
      government appealed that decision to the Hawaii Supreme Court, and a final decision is
      expected any time. This vote will essentially nullify the expected positive court
      decision. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Alaska, voters elected to amend the state Constitution
      to limit the definition of marriage as only between one man and one woman. The initiative
      was in reaction to a ruling by the state's Superior Court (Brause v. Alaska) this past
      February in Alaska determining that the denial of same-sex marriage violates privacy and
      equal protection under the state's constitution. </font></p>

      anti-gay discrimination. In South Portland, 60 percent of the voters favored keeping the
      state law. This year the South Portland City Council decided to put the issue directly to
      the voters rather than having the council vote on the ordinance. </font></p>

      statewide civil rights law banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,
      activists with Concerned Citizens of Ogunquit gathered enough signatures to have a human
      rights ordinance modeled after the statewide non-discrimination bill placed on the
      November 3rd ballot. </font></p>

      would have added the categories of sexual orientation and familial status to the City of
      Fayetteville's non-discrimination policy for public employees. Last spring, the city
      council passed this non-discrimination resolution. The mayor vetoed it, and in a rare move
      the council overrode the mayor's veto, effectively enacting the resolution as law. A local
      group affiliated with the Christian Coalition gathered enough petition signatures to put
      the measure up for a vote. </font></p>

      city council and mayor enacted the ordinance into law last spring. Shortly thereafter
      right-wing opposition groups gathered enough signatures to have the measure referred to
      the ballot in the hopes of defeating them in November. </font></p>
