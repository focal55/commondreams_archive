    eleven of the most influential environmental, health and anti-nuclear public interest
    organizations sent a joint letter to President Clinton (see attached) demanding a
    retraction of remarks made last week by the lead U.S. climate negotiator who touted the
    need for nuclear power to address global warming. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In
    a speech on October 28 before the Center for National Policy, Stuart Eizenstat,
    Undersecretary of State for Economic, Business and Agricultural Affairs, expressed his
    &quot;firm belief&quot; that nuclear power must &quot;be a significant part of our energy
    future and a large part of the western world (sic), if we're going to meet these (emission
    reduction) targets [of the Kyoto Protocol] (Reuters 10-28-98).&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The letter contrasted Secretary Eizenstat's comments with
    past comments by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, stating that &quot;it is
    highly inappropriate for our lead delegate on global warming to be making statements that
    are apparently contrary to Administration policy.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In his 1993 State of the Union address, President Clinton
    called for the elimination of &quot;programs that are no longer needed, such as nuclear
    power research and development.&quot; In addition, in <i>Earth in the Balance, </i>Vice
    President Gore stated &quot;it is a mistake to argue that nuclear power holds the key to
    solving global warming.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is no mention of nuclear power in the plan the U.S.
    has released in Buenos Aires. Even so, the International Nuclear Forum has over 100
    representatives attending the current round of climate negotiations to provide information
    about how nuclear power can help solve global warming. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eizenstat's comments are of particular concern given
    nuclear power's dismal safety, environmental and economic record. Signers emphasized that
    &quot;it would be morally irresponsible to trade reduced greenhouse gas emissions today
    for an increased legacy of risk and radioactive waste that will plague generations to
    come.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The organizations that signed the letter include: 20/20
    Vision, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, National Environmental Trust, Nuclear
    Information Resource Service, Ozone Action, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public
    Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, Rainforest Action Network, Safe Energy

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Honorable William Clinton<br>
    The White House<br>
    Washington, DC 20500 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear President Clinton: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We, the undersigned, respectfully call for an immediate
    retraction of recent public comments by Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, lead
    U.S. delegate to the global warming negotiations. Last week, Under Secretary Eizenstat
    publicly expressed his &quot;firm belief&quot; that nuclear power must &quot;be a
    significant part of our energy future and a large part of the western world, if we are
    going to meet these (emission reduction) targets [of the Kyoto Protocol].&quot; (Reuters
    10-28-98) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under Secretary Eizenstat's statement is deeply troubling
    for various reasons:<br>
    In your 1993 State of the Union address, you called for an elimination of &quot;programs
    that are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Vice President Gore's opinions on the subject are
    apparently at odds with Under Secretary Eizenstat's. In Earth In The Balance, then Senator
    Gore stated that &quot;it is a mistake to argue that nuclear power holds the key to
    solving global warming.&quot; (page 329) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under Secretary Eizenstat's remarks are out of synch with
    the Administration's public and budget commitments to increasing investment in energy
    conservation, efficiency and renewable energy projects, while decreasing the historic
    appropriations bias for nuclear power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the overwhelming weight of economic reality and
    public opinion make nuclear power an untenable solution for global warming and the future
    energy needs of our country. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is highly inappropriate for our lead delegate on global
    warming to be making statements that are apparently contrary to Administration policy.
    Such statements will only serve to disrupt the global warming negotiations and undermine
    efforts to create clean and affordable solutions to global warming by developing renewable
    and environmentally benign solutions to this global threat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once again, we respectfully request that Under Secretary
    Eizenstat's statements be publicly retracted by the Administration. In addition, Under
    Secretary Eizenstat should be immediately instructed, as lead U.S delegate, to no longer
    advance policies that are contrary to the Administration's support for sustainable energy
    development. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The long-term economic, environmental and social costs of
    nuclear power are historically evident and well documented. Touting nuclear power as an
    economically viable solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions contradicts nuclear
    power's dismal marketplace performance. In just eleven states, utility companies are
    seeking more than $112 billion to bail out their failed investments, which include nuclear
    power plants that cannot compete in the deregulated energy market. Furthermore, it would
    be morally irresponsible to trade reduced greenhouse gas emissions today for an increased
    legacy of risk and radioactive waste that will plague generations to come. </font></p>
