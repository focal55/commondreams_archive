    Finds As Temperatures Rise, So Do Infectious Diseases Such as Malaria, Dengue Fever</font></strong></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="455" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 5 - Global warming will have grave
    consequences for human health and already appears to be a major factor in the alarming
    spread of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and meningitis, according to a
    new report released today (Thursday) by World Wildlife Fund. The report notes that
    children and the elderly are especially susceptible. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There
    are strong indications that a disturbing change in disease patterns has begun and that
    global warming is contributing to them,&quot; said the report's author, Dr. Paul Epstein,
    Associate Director of the Harvard Medical School's Center for Health and the Global
    Environment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Among the report's findings:</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The spread of infectious diseases has accelerated not only
    because the world is warming, but because nighttime temperatures are rising faster than
    daytime temperatures. This has particularly disturbing implications for human health
    because the range of many disease-transmitting insects is limited chiefly by nighttime
    temperatures; </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Because there is less relief at night, summer heat waves are
        also claiming more fatalities around the globe and can be expected to pose an even more
        serious risk, particularly for children and the aged, in the future as temperatures
        continue to rise; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Climate plays a central role in maintaining the balance
        between predators and prey -- a balance that is being altered by global warming in a way
        that could tip the scales in favor of the disease-transmitting pests and pathogens that
        predators had heretofore kept in check. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Global
        warming has the frightening potential to pose a major threat to all life, including
        ours,&quot; said Jennifer Morgan, Climate Policy Officer for WWF-US. &quot;Given the
        stakes, reducing the carbon pollution that causes global warming should receive the same
        priority that governments give to halting the proliferation of chemical and biological
        weapons,&quot; she added. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The WWF study notes that diseases like malaria and dengue
        fever are affecting new and less disease-resistant populations as warmer conditions allow
        mosquitoes to survive over a wider area and at higher altitudes. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dengue, a potentially fatal disease for which there is no
        vaccine, blanketed South America in 1995. It has been recorded in northern Argentina,
        Australia, and now infects Asia. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Malaria kills an estimated two million people a year
        and more than two billion people are currently considered at risk of contracting the
        disease. In the Northern Hemisphere, cases of malaria contracted from local mosquitoes in
        recent years have been reported in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Texas, Georgia,
        Florida, Michigan and even Toronto. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Warmer winters and nights are altering the
        distribution of mosquito-borne diseases, while extreme weather events such as floods and
        droughts are spawning large clusters of infectious disease outbreaks,&quot; Epstein said.
        &quot;The costs of taking a 'business-as-usual' approach to the problem of global warming
        are mounting.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The WWF report was issued on the eve of a meeting of
        environment ministers from 166 countries, who will be traveling to Argentina to join the
        UN-sponsored climate change negotiations that have been taking place in Buenos Aires this
        week. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The experts have been discussing how to implement the
        commitment made by industrialized nations under last year's Kyoto Protocol to reduce their
        emissions of the gases that cause global warming by five percent over the next 15 years. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WWF believes that, while the Kyoto Protocol was a small
        step forward, a five percent reduction in the emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal
        greenhouse gas, is not nearly enough to mitigate the most serious effects of global
        warming. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Western industrialized countries, which are by
        far the largest CO2 emitters, must take effective, stronger steps now to reduce their
        emissions at home in order to ensure that we see a permanent downward turn in carbon
        pollution by the turn of the century,&quot; Morgan said. </font></p>
