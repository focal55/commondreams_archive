    Gun Control as Pivotal Campaign Issue; NRA Dumps $5 million into Races and Still Loses
    Major Ground</font></strong></td>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    November 4 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">From New York to Florida, Maryland to
    California, and Illinois to New Mexico, candidates in nationally-watched races campaigned
    on the gun control issue and won.&nbsp; And, for the second election in a row, the gun
    lobby suffered significant losses, despite its multi-million dollar campaign coffers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prior to the election, Handgun Control, Inc.&#146;s Voter
    Education Fund released its &quot;Dangerous Dozen&quot;&nbsp; list, which includes 11
    candidates who could make it easier for children and criminals to get guns and Charlton
    Heston&#146;s opposition to an important state referendum.&nbsp; In yesterday&#146;s
    elections, voters defeated 11 out of 12 of the &quot;Dangerous Dozen,&quot; including:
    four U.S. Senate candidates, Sen. Al D&#146;Amato (NY), State Senator Fay Boozman (AR),
    Sen. Lauch Faircloth (NC), Rep. Linda Smith (WA);&nbsp;&nbsp; three U.S. House candidates,
    former Rep. Bob Dornan (CA-46), Rep. Bill&nbsp; Redmond (NM-3), and Rep. Vince Snowbarger
    (KS-3); three Gubernatorial candidates, State Attorney General Dan Lungren (CA), Rep.
    Glenn Poshard (IL), and Ellen Sauerbrey (MD); and Charlton Heston and his opposition to
    Florida&#146;s Revision 12 gun show referendum.&nbsp; The only &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot;
    candidate to survive the election was Rep. Steve Chabot (OH-1).&nbsp; This election
    demonstrates once again that opposition to responsible gun laws is no longer acceptable to
    the overwhelming majority of Americans. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the nation&#146;s most watched U.S. Senate race, Rep.
    Charles Schumer, author of the Brady Bill and federal assault weapons ban, soundly
    defeated Senator Alfonse D&#146;Amato in New York.&nbsp; The NRA spent $165,000 on behalf
    of D&#146;Amato.&nbsp; The NRA also spent a significant amount of money to re-elect Sen.
    Lauch Faircloth (NC), who was defeated by John Edwards, a supporter of the Brady Law and
    the federal assault weapons ban. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The leadership of California has now turned dramatically in
    favor of gun control.&nbsp; Gun control supporter Lt. Governor Gray Davis defeated
    Attorney General Dan Lungren in the race for Governor.&nbsp; Lungren&#146;s violation of
    the California assault weapons ban, as Attorney General, emerged as a key issue in the
    race.&nbsp; After Mr. Lungren lost a lawsuit on this issue earlier this year, it was
    revealed that he had illegally registered more than 16,000 assault weapons after the
    deadline established by state law.&nbsp; As Governor, Mr. Davis is expected to sign
    several gun violence prevention measures recently vetoed by Governor Wilson, including a
    Saturday Night Special Ban.&nbsp; In an effort to defeat Davis, the NRA blanketed the
    state with mailings to their&nbsp; members, urging them to vote for Lungren.
    &nbsp; Clearly, their efforts were unsuccessful.&nbsp; In another California race defined
    by gun control, Sen. Barbara Boxer won re-election against her anti-gun-control opponent
    Matt Fong. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Maryland, Governor Parris Glendening touted his strong
    record on gun control all the way to an election-day victory.&nbsp; Maryland gun dealers
    called his opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, their &quot;savior.&quot;&nbsp; When Sauerbrey ran
    against Glendening in 1994, she challenged election results with $25,000 in support from
    the NRA.&nbsp; Governor Glendening signed Maryland&#146;s successful one-gun-a-month
    legislation into law and has consistently criticized Sauerbrey&#146;s opposition to gun
    control.&nbsp; He has also pledged to seek legislation which would require all handguns
    sold in Maryland to utilize &quot;personalized gun&quot; technology, which would prevent
    anyone other than a designated owner from firing a gun. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the most accurate test of the NRA&#146;s declining
    electoral strength, the NRA spent an estimated $400,000 to defeat Florida&#146;s Revision
    12, the referendum that will allow couties to require background checks and waiting
    periods on sales by unlicensed dealers at gun shows.&nbsp; The NRA ran controversial ads
    featuring Charlton Heston throughout Florida, the home state of former NRA president
    Marion Hammer.&nbsp; Despite these efforts, the NRA lost in a landslide, with more than
    70% of Floridians voting in favor of the referendum.&nbsp; The success of the referendum
    could have a domino effect, with other states following Florida&#146;s lead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Voters supported gun control across party lines. In the
    Illinois Gubernatorial race, pro-gun-control Republican George Ryan defeated
    &nbsp; Democratic Rep. Glenn Poshard, who opposed and then waffled on gun control. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The 1998 elections are further proof that support for
    gun control is mainstream and mainstreet America,&quot; said Handgun Control, Inc. Chair
    Sarah Brady.&nbsp; &quot;Furthermore, in race after race, the NRA and its deep pockets
    proved to be a political liability, not an asset.&nbsp; After yesterday&#146;s election, I
    think we will see more and more candidates and Members of Congress back away from NRA
    money and anti-gun-control positions if they want to win the support of the American
    people.&quot; </font></p>
