    not, there are reports that the U.S. is changing its policy to a more sanctions-based
    approach. While many are claiming that Iraq would be rid of the sanctions if it complied
    with the weapons inspections, an examination of U.S. policymakers' statements since the
    Gulf War suggests otherwise:<br>
    <br>
    April 3, 1991: U.N. Security Council passes Resolution 687. It includes many demands but
    states that once Iraq complies with the weapons inspection regime, the sanctions
    &quot;shall have no further force or effect.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    May 20, 1991: James Baker, Secretary of State: &quot;We are not interested in seeing a
    relaxation of sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    January 13, 1993: Incoming President Clinton: &quot;If he [Hussein] wants a different
    relationship with the United States and the United Nations, all he has to do is change his
    behavior.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    January 14, 1993: Clinton backtracks: &quot;There is no difference between my policy and
    the policy of the present Administration.... I have no intention of normalizing relations
    with him.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    January 12, 1995: While inspections were taking place, Ambassador Madeleine Albright said
    the U.S. was &quot;determined to oppose any modification of the sanctions regime until
    Iraq has moved to comply with all its outstanding obligations.&quot; She specifically
    cited the return of Kuwaiti weaponry and non-military equipment. <br>
    <br>
    March 26, 1997: Albright, in her first major foreign policy address as Secretary of State:
    &quot;We do not agree with the nations who argue that if Iraq complies with its
    obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction, sanctions should be lifted. Our view,
    which is unshakable, is that Iraq must prove its peaceful intentions.... And the evidence
    is overwhelming that Saddam Hussein's intentions will never be peaceful.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    November 14, 1997: Clinton: [When Iraq broke the inspections regime] &quot;What he has
    just done is to ensure that the sanctions will be there until the end of time or as long
    as he lasts.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    November 14, 1997: National Security Adviser Sandy Berger: &quot;He can't be in compliance
    if he's thrown the UNSCOM people out. So it's a necessary condition. It may not be a
    sufficient condition.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    December 16, 1997: Clinton on Hussein's actions: &quot;I think that he felt probably that
    the United States would never vote to lift the sanctions on him no matter what he
    did...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    August 20, 1997: Ambassador Bill Richardson: &quot;Sanctions may stay on in
    perpetuity.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    September 15, 1998: Martin Indyk, Assistant Secretary of State, claims &quot;the Security
    Council resolutions provide in very specific terms for the lifting of sanctions when Iraq
    has fully complied with all the Security Council resolutions.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    November 10, 1998: State Department spokesperson James Rubin states that sanctions will
    not be altered until after Iraq complies with U.N. resolutions &quot;...including on
    Kuwaiti prisoners, Kuwaiti equipment, and, in short, demonstrating his peaceful
    intentions...&quot; Later, Rubin states: &quot;The Security Council has set out a very
    simple path to resolve this situation. And all it requires is him doing what he agreed to
    do, cooperating with UNSCOM...&quot;<br>

    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">August 6, 1990: United Nations Security Council passes
        Resolution 661, placing sanctions on Iraq to &quot;restore the authority of the legitimate
        government of Kuwait.&quot; <br>
        (For U.N. resolutions, see: <a href="gopher://gopher.undp.org/11/undocs/scd/scouncil">gopher://gopher.undp.org/11/undocs/scd/scouncil</a>)
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">April 3, 1991: U.N. Security Council passes Resolution 687
        which states that upon &quot;the completion by Iraq of all actions contemplated in&quot;
        specific paragraphs of the resolution, &quot;the prohibitions against financial
        transactions ... shall have no further force or effect.&quot; The paragraphs cited have to
        do with weapons inspections. Other paragraphs in the resolution have to do with
        &quot;return of all Kuwaiti property seized by Iraq&quot; and Iraqi liability for losses
        and damage resulting from Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">April 5, 1991: U.N. Security Council passes Resolution 688
        that &quot;demands that Iraq&quot; end its repression &quot;of all Iraqi citizens.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">May 20, 1991: President George Bush: &quot;At this juncture,
        my view is we don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in
        power.&quot; James Baker, Secretary of State: &quot;We are not interested in seeing a
        relaxation of sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">March 6, 1992: The Washington Post reports that the U.S.
        Census Bureau demographer assigned to estimate the number of Iraqis killed during the Gulf
        War will be fired. Beth Osborne Daponte estimates that 86,000 men, 40,000 women and 32,000
        children died at the hands of American-led coalition forces, during the domestic
        rebellions that followed and from postwar deprivation. After various protests, the Bureau
        rescinds the firing but rewrites the report, lowering the death toll and removing the data
        on women and children. The following month, the Pentagon published its three-volume
        official history of the war, but a draft chapter on casualties is deleted and there is no
        mention of Iraqi deaths. (The London Independent, April 23, 1992) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">September 24, 1992: The New England Journal of Medicine
        publishes the findings of Harvard researchers that 46,700 Iraqi children under five have
        died from the combined effects of war and trade sanctions in the first seven months of
        1991. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">January 13, 1993: As Bill Clinton is about to take office,
        he states: &quot;I am a Baptist. I believe in death-bed conversions. If he [Hussein] wants
        a different relationship with the United States and the United Nations, all he has to do
        is change his behavior.&quot; (The New York Times, January 14, 1993) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">January 14, 1993: In the face of criticism, particularly
        from The New York Times, that he might lift sanctions and even normalize relations with
        Iraq, Clinton backtracks: &quot;There is no difference between my policy and the policy of
        the present Administration.... I have no intention of normalizing relations with
        him.&quot; (See The New York Times and Boston Globe, January 15, 1993) Incoming Secretary
        of State Warren Christopher: &quot;I find it hard to share the Baptist belief in
        redemption.... I see no substantial change in the position and continuing total support
        for what the [Bush] administration has done.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">January 12, 1995: While inspections are taking place, though
        not complete, Ambassador Madeleine Albright says the U.S. is &quot;determined to oppose

        non-military equipment. (Reuters, January 12, 1995) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">May 12, 1996: On &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Lesley Stahl asks
        Albright: &quot;We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's
        more children than died in Hiroshima. Is the price worth it?&quot; Albright responds:
        &quot;I think this is a very hard choice, but the price -- we think the price is worth
        it.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Late 1996: The United Nations begins
        &quot;oil-for-food&quot; program. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">March 26, 1997: Albright, in her first major foreign policy
        address as Secretary of State: &quot;We do not agree with the nations who argue that if
        Iraq complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction, sanctions
        should be lifted. Our view, which is unshakable, is that Iraq must prove its peaceful
        intentions. It can only do that by complying with all of the Security Council resolutions
        to which it is subjected. Is it possible to conceive of such a government under Saddam
        Hussein? When I was a professor, I taught that you have to consider all possibilities. As
        Secretary of State, I have to deal in the realm of reality and probability. And the
        evidence is overwhelming that Saddam Hussein's intentions will never be peaceful.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">October 4, 1996: United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
        releases report on Iraq. &quot;Around 4,500 children under the age of five are dying here
        every month from hunger and disease,&quot; said Philippe Heffinck, UNICEF's representative
        for Iraq. <a href="gopher://gopher.unicef.org/00/.cefdata/.prgva96/prgva35">gopher://gopher.unicef.org/00/.cefdata/.prgva96/prgva35</a>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">October 3, 1997: A joint study by the United Nations' Food
        &amp; Agriculture Organization and World Food Program, found the sanctions
        &quot;significantly constrained Iraq's ability to earn foreign currency needed to import
        sufficient quantities of food to meet needs. As a consequence, food shortages and
        malnutrition became progressively severe and chronic in the 1990s.&quot; <a href="http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/faoinfo/economic/giews/english/alertes/srirq997.htm">www.fao.org/WAICENT/faoinfo/economic/giews/english/alertes/srirq997.htm</a>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 7, 1997: Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz:
        &quot;The American government says openly, clearly, that it's not going to endorse lifting
        the sanctions on Iraq unless the leadership of Iraq is changed.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 14, 1997: President Clinton. [During a standoff on
        weapons inspectors] &quot;What he [Hussein] says his objective is, is to relieve the
        people of Iraq, and presumably the government, of the burden of the sanctions. What he has
        just done is to ensure that the sanctions will be there until the end of time or as long
        as he lasts. So I think that if his objective is to try to get back into the business of
        manufacturing vast stores of weapons of mass destruction and then try to either use them
        or sell them, then at some point the United States, and more than the United States, would
        be more than happy to try to stop that.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 14, 1997: In response to the question &quot;Is it
        his [Clinton's] opinion that the sanction will not be lifted ever as long as Saddam is in
        power, whatever he does?&quot; National Security Adviser Sandy Berger states: &quot;No.
        Let Saddam Hussein -- let Saddam Hussein come into compliance, and then we can discuss
        whether there are any circumstances... It has been our position consistently that Saddam
        Hussein has to comply with all the relative Security Council resolutions from this
        action.... I don't think, under these circumstances, when he has [sic] blatantly out of
        compliance, it is the right time for us to talk about how we lift the sanctions.... It's
        been the U.S. position since the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein comply -- has to
        comply with all of the relevant Security Council resolutions.&quot; In response to the
        question &quot;but what the president said -- what he has just done is to ensure that the
        sanctions will be there until the end of time or as long as he lasts.&quot; Berger
        responds: &quot;Well, that's right, and that's not inconsistent with what I've said. In
        other words, there's no way -- if he is -- if he's got to be in compliance, he can't be in
        compliance if he's thrown the UNSCOM people out. So it's a necessary condition. It may not
        be a sufficient condition.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 18, 1997: The Guardian reports: &quot;The prospects
        for a diplomatic solution to the confrontation between Iraq and the United States
        strengthened significantly yesterday with the U.S. and Britain offering a relaxation of
        economic sanctions against Baghdad as international moves to resolve the dispute over
        United Nations weapons inspectors continued.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 20, 1997: [A stand-off is defused] A Russian-Iraqi
        communique is released pledging that Moscow will &quot;energetically promote the speedy
        lifting of sanctions against Iraq on the basis of its compliance with the corresponding
        U.N. resolutions.&quot; Albright states that the lifting of the sanctions &quot;will
        probably be discussed at some time, but the United States has not agreed to
        anything.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 26, 1997: UNICEF reports that &quot;The most
        alarming results are those on malnutrition, with 32 per cent of children under the age of
        five, some 960,000 children, chronically malnourished -- a rise of 72 per cent since 1991.
        Almost one quarter (around 23 per cent) are underweight -- twice as high as the levels
        found in neighbouring Jordan or Turkey.&quot; Philippe Heffinck, UNICEF Representative in
        Baghdad: &quot;And what concerns us now is that there is no sign of any improvement since
        Security Council Resolution 986/1111 [oil-for-food] came into force.&quot; <a href="http://www.unicef.org/newsline/97pr60.htm">www.unicef.org/newsline/97pr60.htm</a> </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 30, 1997: Ambassador Bill Richardson in the
        Washington Post: &quot;To the extent Saddam used the inspectors' two-week absence to hide
        weapons, he has only delayed for Iraq the time it will take the UNSCOM team to ensure
        compliance, therefore further delaying any possibility of lifting sanctions.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">December 9, 1997: In response to the question: &quot;The
        United States has given apparently contradictory criteria for when it will lift the
        sanctions. It says it will do it when UNSCOM is allowed into Iraq, when UNSCOM can get
        into the 'palaces,' when Iraq abides by all U.N. resolutions, including paying a few
        hundred billion in reparations, when Saddam Hussein is overthrown, or never. The question:
        When is it?&quot; Richardson: &quot;Our policy is clear. We believe that Saddam Hussein
        should comply with all the Security Council resolutions, and that includes 1137, those
        that deal with the UNSCOM inspectors, those that deal with human rights issues, those that
        deal with prisoners of war with Kuwait, those that deal with the treatment of his own
        people. We think that there are standards of international behavior.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">December 16, 1997: President Clinton: &quot;I am willing to
        maintain the sanctions as long as he does not comply with the resolutions.... There are
        those that would like to lift the sanctions. I am not among them. I am not in favor of
        lifting the sanctions until he complies.... But keep in mind, he has not come out, as some
        people have suggested, ahead on this last confrontation. Because now the world community
        is much less likely to vote to lift any sanctions on him...&quot; In response to the
        question &quot;How do you assess Saddam Hussein?&quot; Clinton makes several points and
        then says: &quot;Finally, I think that he felt probably that the United States would never
        vote to lift the sanctions on him no matter what he did. There are some people who believe
        that. Now I think he was dead wrong on virtually every point.&quot; </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">July 30, 1998: The New York Times reports: &quot;Russia
        tried and failed to get Security Council action today on a resolution declaring that Iraq
        had complied with demands to destroy its nuclear weapons program and was ready to move
        away from intrusive inspections to long-term monitoring... Russia has been arguing that
        those files can be 'closed' one at a time, to give Iraq some motivation for further
        cooperation. The United States has held that all requirements must be met before sanctions
        can be altered.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">August 3, 1998, (Monday): Reuters reports: &quot;The chief
        United Nations arms inspector, Richard Butler, arrived here today for talks that Baghdad
        says have to hasten an end to international sanctions. Mr. Butler, who arrived to scathing
        criticism from Iraqi newspapers, said he wanted to end his work of disarmament in Iraq as
        soon as possible to enable the Security Council to lift its eight-year-old sanctions. Iraq
        said on Thursday that it would take unspecified action, based on the outcome of Mr.
        Butler's visit, if the sanctions were not removed as soon as possible.&quot; </font></li>

        &quot;child mortality for children under five years of age is from five to six thousand
        per month.&quot; Halliday states: &quot;There are many reasons for these tragic and
        unnecessary deaths, including the poor health of mothers, the breakdown of health
        services, the poor nutritional intake of both adults and young children and the high
        incidence of water-born diseases as a result of the collapse of Iraq's water and
        sanitation system--and, of course, the lack of electric power to drive that system, both
        crippled by war damage following the 1991 Gulf War.&quot; (See remarks, <a href="http://www.accuracy.org/halliday.htm">www.accuracy.org/halliday.htm</a>) </font></li>

        holds the key to getting sanctions lifted. All Saddam Hussein has to do is provide what he

        1991, a full, final and complete declaration of the totality of his holdings.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">September 15, 1998: Martin Indyk, Assistant Secretary of
        State: &quot;First of all, there is one serious consequence that has already occurred;
        that is, the Security Council has voted unanimously to suspend indefinitely sanctions
        reviews. That means there will be no sanctions reviews and sanctions will not be
        lifted.&quot; Indyk then claimed: &quot;the Security Council resolutions provide in very
        specific terms for the lifting of sanctions when Iraq has fully complied with all the
        Security Council resolutions. And that is the crux of the matter; it's not a question that
        they'll never be lifted, but the conditions on which they'll be lifted will never appear
        to be fulfilled.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">November 10, 1998: State Department spokesperson James
        Rubin: &quot;We've stated very clearly that it is up to Saddam Hussein to comply with the
        resolutions of the Security Council that lay out the needs and requirements, including on
        weapons of mass destruction, coming back into compliance with those resolutions, including
        on Kuwaiti prisoners, Kuwaiti equipment, and, in short, demonstrating his peaceful
        intentions, in which case we are prepared to see an adjustment in the sanctions
        regime.&quot; A few moments later, Rubin states: &quot;The Security Council has set out a
        very simple path to resolve this situation. And all it requires is him doing what he
        agreed to do, cooperating with UNSCOM -- not refusing cooperation with UNSCOM -- but
        providing them the information they need.&quot; </font></li>
