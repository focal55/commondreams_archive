    DE CHILE - November 6 - Eight years after Chile regained democracy, legal restrictions on
    free expression are more pervasive than in any other democratic society in the Western
    hemisphere, according to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports98/chile/">a report </a>published
    today by Human Rights Watch. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 165-page report,
    Human Rights Watch blames government leaders for failing to tackle authoritarian laws on
    free expression imposed by the military, as well as some that predate military rule.
    &quot;Scraping a little below the democratic veneer, one finds a deep distrust of free
    debate,&quot; said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's
    Americas division. &quot;Civilian leaders are still afraid of the enormous influence of
    Augusto Pinochet in Chilean society. This is the legacy of his seventeen years of
    dictatorship.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">General Pinochet, who returned the government to civilians
    in 1990, was detained in London on October 16, 1998, on charges of crimes against humanity
    filed by a Spanish judge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chile's 1958 State Security Law criminalizes
    strongly-worded criticism of government authorities, military chiefs, Supreme Court
    justices, and even members of Congress. Such criticism is deemed an offense against public
    order, punishable by a prison sentence of up to five years. Since 1990, eight politicians
    and fifteen journalists have been arrested and charged under the law. The law has been an
    important tool for General Pinochet to persecute his human rights critics. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Congress and members of the judiciary have also brought
    several suits based on the State Security Law. One former Pinochet minister was given a
    suspended sentence in 1996 for insulting Congress, a case now under consideration by the
    Inter-American Commission of Human Rights of the Organization of American States.
    &quot;This law stifles legitimate political debate, no matter who initiates the
    prosecution,&quot; said Vivanco. He urged President Eduardo Frei to seek immediate repeal
    of the law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Several articles of the military penal code also limit
    political criticism. Military tribunals have responsibility for trying the crime of
    sedition, for example, which deprives civilian critics of the right to be judged by an
    independent and impartial court. Current laws allow judges to ban any press coverage of
    court proceedings on controversial criminal cases, and thereby to conceal possible
    shortcomings in investigations and trial procedures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report charges that judges meticulously implement the
    letter of the law, but fail to take into account basic human rights principles. &quot;In
    recent years, we have seen judges putting constitutional rights into a hierarchy, with
    freedom of expression consistently ranking below other rights, such as honor or
    privacy,&quot; said Vivanco. Judges used this argument to ban a book freely available in
    Argentina (journalist Francisco Martorell's Diplomatic Impunity) and a film widely
    available outside the country (Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Film censorship, although less prevalent today than under
    the military government, is still explicitly mandated by the Constitution and is practiced
    by an undemocratic agency that largely works in secret, the Council of Cinematographic
    Evaluation. Chilean television has been at the center of a public debate recently due to
    the unpopularity of restrictions affecting cable, which now reaches 25 percent of Chilean
    homes. These restrictions include both tight government regulations on broadcasts
    depicting sex and violence, as well as the editorial policy of local cable operators, who
    routinely cut programs and films offered by international cable companies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Human Rights Watch report found self-censorship
    widespread in television, partly because the government's television watchdog body
    strictly enforces ill-defined regulations on morality. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch
    stated, directors at the public channel, Television Nacional, have increasingly sacrificed
    pluralism in favor of opinions unlikely to give offense, making it difficult to find
    programs of real critical content anywhere in the medium. </font></p>
