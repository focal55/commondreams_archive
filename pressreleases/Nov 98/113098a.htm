      <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON
        - November 30 - </font><font size="2" face="Arial">The historic Brady Law waiting period on handgun purchasers expires today when 
the original Brady system is replaced with a National Instant Check System (NICS). Former White House Press Secretary James Brady, for whom the law was 
named, his wife and chair of Handgun Control, Inc., Sarah Brady, Senators, 
Representatives and law enforcement representatives held a news conference today 
to warn Americans in 24 states that they will no longer be protected against 
impulse crime by the well-supported &quot;cooling-off&quot; period, as gun 
purchasers walk out of stores with new guns as soon as the computer has cleared 
their record.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">The original Brady Law, which mandated a waiting 
period and background check for all handgun purchasers, was altered in the 
legislative process to sunset in favor of NICS, which relies on computerized 
federal data to immediately check prospective firearms purchasers for felony 
convictions and other barriers to purchase.  Without a mandatory waiting period, 
local police departments will not have time to participate in the background 
check, and gun purchasers considering crimes of passion or impulse suicides will 
no longer have a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period to protect themselves or their 
victims.  However, public safety will be improved by the new rule that 
background checks will also now be conducted on all firearm purchasers, not just 
on those buying handguns.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Although the Justice Department has completed its 
work in getting the NICS system ready under a very tight deadline, it will not 
have access to many state and local records that were previously being checked, 
including in most instances court restraining orders, involuntary admission to a 
mental hospital, domestic violence misdemeanors, recent arrests that are not yet 
computerized, and drug offenses, among others.  As a result, many prohibited 
purchasers could slip through the cracks.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;More than ninety percent of Americans agree 
that a waiting period to purchase firearms is sane, sensible policy, and the 
success of the Brady Law over the last five years proves them right,&quot; said 
Mrs. Brady.  &quot;Why are we fixing what isn’t broken? And why will we again be 
losing innocent people to an enraged spouse, a disturbed employee, or a would-be 
criminal needing a fast and easy firearm?</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">After a 7-year battle in Congress, President 
Clinton signed the Brady Law on November 30, 1993, with the support of more than 
90 percent of Americans.  Unable to block passage of the legislation in the face 
of this tidal wave of public support, the gun lobby’s allies in Congress amended 
the legislation to require a mandatory &quot;sunset&quot; of the waiting period 
in five years, to be replaced by a computerized national instant check system.  
At the time, the Brady Law affected 32 states which had not developed their own 
background check system; now, five years later, 24 states will be making the 
transition from a waiting period to an instant check.</font> </P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the implementation of the Brady Law in 
February 1994, almost a quarter-million prohibited purchasers have been stopped 
from buying handguns in gun stores, according to the U.S. Department of 
Justice.  Since 1994, gun-related violent crime has been dropping even faster 
than violent crime overall, and a 1997 study by the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence demonstrated a dramatic decrease in interstate gun trafficking since 
the Brady Law went into effect.  In fact, states that began conducting 
background checks on handgun purchasers when the Brady Law went into effect are 
as much as 86% less likely to be sources of guns used in crimes in other states 
than they were prior to when the checks were performed.</font> </P>
      </center>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That’s why on July 15, 1998, Senator Dick Durbin 
of Illinois, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and then-Representative 
Charles Schumer of New York introduced a bill that would have established a 
permanent minimum three-day waiting period for the purchase of firearms to take 
effect today.  Despite the overwhelming popularity and effectiveness of the law, 
gun lobby supporters in Congress blocked passage of this important public safety 
measure in the last Congress.</font> </P>
<P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The fight over the waiting 
period is far from over,&quot; Mrs. Brady said.  &quot;Jim and I will be back to 
the Hill again next year.  This issue is far too important to be ignored by 
Congress.&quot;</font> </P><center>

<font size="2" face="Arial">Handgun Control, Inc., chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation’s largest 
citizens’ gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington, DC, HCI works 
to enact stronger federal, state and local gun control laws, but does not seek 
to ban handguns.  Founded in 1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide 
and works with local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable 
gun control laws.</font></I> </P></td>
