    November 4 - The American Bus Association (ABA) is the target of today's ADAPT action, as
    the national disability rights organization goes on the offensive against the
    over-the-road bus company's trade association demanding access to intercity bus travel.
    700 ADAPT members have shut down the building at 1100 New York Avenue, NW, to demand that
    the association drop its lawsuit against the Department of Transportation's (DOT) recently
    issued regulations which requires over-the-road bus companies such as Greyhound to comply
    with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). &quot;The long overdue ADA regulations
    that DOT issued require that companies like Greyhound equip all new buses with
    lifts,&quot; says national ADAPT organizer Mike Auberger, &quot;and the day after the
    regulations were signed, the ABA sued the Department of Transportation.&quot;</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The lawsuit claims that these regulations will be an exorbitant
    burden on companies such as Greyhound, causing ticket costs to skyrocket and eliminate
    small rural stops. However, ADAPT recognizes that these are frivolous complaints, and is
    demonstrating at the ABA national offices to drive home an important message: WE ARE
    RIDERS!! According to recent research conducted by the DOT, there are over 15 million
    Americans with disabilities living in rural areas who are potential bus riders, and the
    overall increase in cost for all riders a mere 33 cents per ticket.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;ADAPT feels strongly that the regulations are fair
    and balanced,&quot; comments Auberger, pointing out that there are federal funds available
    assisting over the road bus companies in purchasing lifts for new buses. The lawsuit is
    the final strike in ADAPT's two year battle with Greyhound and other over-the-road buses,
    to achieve access to buses for disabled Americans. &quot;I've been treated worse than a
    dog by Greyhound,&quot; claims David Armandariz, an ADAPT member from El Paso Texas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Armandariz, who is paralyzed from the shoulders down, was
    dropped on the steps as the Greyhound driver carried him onto the bus. He remained on the
    steps for several minutes as the Greyhound employees discussed how to get him into a seat.
    &quot;They handle you worse than luggage under the cargo, stated Armandariz, &quot;They
    carry me on the bus like a sack of potatoes.&quot; ADAPT has been pushing the Department
    of Transportation to issue regulations requiring lifts on all new buses. In September the
    group's efforts paid of when the DOT issued regulations guaranteeing access to new buses.
    However, immediately after DOT's Secretary Slater signed the rules, ABA filed their
    lawsuit. ADAPT is demanding that the ABA withdraw the lawsuit, and that the association
    support the newly issued regulations.</font></p>
