    November 4 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1998 elections resulted in some
    stunning victories for feminist candidates in a year when major losses had been predicted.
    These elections confirmed the importance of grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts and
    underscored the power of&nbsp; women's vote. Perhaps most encouraging of all, the
    elections were a clear repudiation of the radical right-wing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Candidates like Barbara Boxer and Patty Murray ran on their
    solid progressive records and won.&nbsp; Tammy Baldwin &#150; the first open lesbian to
    serve in Congress and the first woman to represent Wisconsin &#150; easily won her
    historic race. In the Senate anti-abortion Al D'Amato was handily defeated by Chuck
    Schumer.&nbsp; And voters in Colorado and Washington rejected the extremists' attack on
    reproductive freedom by defeating proposed abortion procedure bans in those states. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the devastating loss of Carol Moseley-Braun, nearly
    70 percent of&nbsp; <a href="http://www.now.org/pac/1998/index.html">NOW/PAC's endorsed
    candidates</a> sailed to victory. Six new women, all of whom campaigned as women's rights
    and abortion rights supporters, were elected to the House for a net gain of two women.
    With the election of&nbsp; Blanche Lambert, the number of women stayed even in the Senate.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While we celebrate our victories, we are dismayed that
    progress is so slow. At this rate, women will not achieve equal representation for more
    than 200 years. Congress remains nearly 90 percent white and 90 percent male in a country
    that is 51 percent women and approximately 30 percent people of color. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 106th Congress we once again will have to fight as
    hard as we can just to stay even.&nbsp; As long as Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott hold the
    reins of power, we have little hope of passing important legislation that will improve the
    lives of women, our families and our communities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will continue our grassroots organizing to keep pressure
    on Congress while we redouble our efforts to elect a Congress that looks like our country.
    We must pass campaign finance reform so that a silver spoon is not the most important
    qualification of any candidate. We must focus the debate on important issues that propel
    the women's vote and the gender gap that was the deciding factor in so many races this
    year. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our only hope for progress is to change the faces of the
    people in power. We must elect real feminists to public offices at every level &#150; from
    dog catcher to president. To pick-up the pace, <a href="http://www.now.org/nnt/05-98/victory.html">NOW PACs' Victory 2000 campaign</a> will
    continue to fill up the pipeline by electing 2000 feminists to office by the end of the
    century to be ready for the next post- reapportionment, redistricting election in 2002. </font></p>
