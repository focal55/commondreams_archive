    AIRES </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">- November 12 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Confidential documents (attached below)&nbsp; from a U.S. business
    association reveal that the U.S. objective in the Climate Convention exclusively benefits
    the U.S. at the expense of developing countries.&nbsp; Knowing this, U.S. Undersecretary
    of State Stuart E. Eizenstat announced to the world's nations gathered at the UN
    Convention on Climate Change today that although President Clinton signed the Protocol
    today, he will not submit it to Congress for ratification until developing countries
    accede to U.S. demands.<br>
    <br>
    The U.S. has steadfastly asserted that ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is dependent on
    commitments by developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. A Business
    Roundtable document found today reveals the corporate agenda behind this U.S. demand.
    &nbsp; According to this document faxed Tuesday to top Administration and Congressional
    officials in Buenos Aires and Washington &quot;developing countries must assume binding
    obligations in the same compliance period as Annex I countries to avoid...significant
    damage to U.S. trade and competitiveness.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The document concedes that European industry is more efficient than US industry, and
    argues that the only way for US business to maintain its competitive edge is to ensure
    developing country commitments and allow unrestricted global trading in emissions.<br>
    <br>
    The document defends the two top U.S. priorities in Buenos Aires - use of unlimited
    emissions trading and full developing country participation - as ways that would allow the
    U.S. to meet &quot;80-90% of its required annual emission reductions&quot; through the
    purchase of emission permits instead of domestic action. Environmentalists have long
    criticized unrestricted emissions trading as a way for the U.S. to avoid taking any
    domestic action to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases while dumping additional
    pollution on Southern nations. The U.S. is responsible for 25% of global greenhouse gas
    emissions.<br>
    <br>
    However, the document admits that &quot;participation in full global trading actually puts
    developing countries at a competitive disadvantage&quot; and admits that gaining their
    participation will not be easy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Business Roundtable is a big business mafia effectively driving the U.S.
    government policy to suit their narrow corporate interests and away from obligations under
    the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse emissions,&quot; explained Shannon Wright of
    Rainforest Action Network. The U.S.-based Business Roundtable is made up of many of the
    nation's most powerful corporations particularly oil and automobile companies which are
    benefitting from the country's increasing use of petroleum. In 1996 alone the BRT handed
    out $11 million to Democrats and in the last two years has funneled $57 into congressional
    election campaigns.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The US continues to protect the oil industry instead of the climate,&quot; said
    Steve Kretzmann of Project Underground.&nbsp; &quot;Until the U.S. finds the courage to
    face down the oil lobby, begins the process of reducing domestic consumption of fossil
    fuels, and stops trying to dump on developing countries, we won't see any progress in
    these talks. You can't solve climate change<br>
    without placing restrictions on the source of the problem fossil fuel use.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The U.S. is seeking to blackmail developing countries by holding up ratification of
    the Kyoto Protocol until they assume binding emission reductions,&quot; explained Cindy
    Baxter of Friends of the Earth. &quot;They do this to protect their corporate sponsors,
    particularly the powerful oil lobby, and not the climate as they claim.&quot;<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Ambassador Eizenstat:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Business Roundtable study group has just completed an
    economic study of the Kyoto Protocol examining international trade and competitiveness
    issues. This study was conducted by Professor James Sweeney of Stanford and Dr. David
    Montgomery of Charles River Associates. It quantifies a number of issues raised earlier
    this year in the The Business Roundtable's white paper entitled, &quot;The Kyoto Protocol:
    A Gap Analysis.&quot; The results of the study are detailed in the attachments.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The results of the study verify that the major variable in
    the cost to the United States economy will be the effectiveness of trading greenhouse gas
    emission credits. The study has not been completely finalized but, I want to bring it to
    your attention since it underlines the importance of achieving U.S. objectives in
    Argentina, namely:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) The importance of not having any limits on emission
    trading - either the 50% cap limit on trading, advocated by the European countries, or the
    ?? inclusion developing countries, particularly China and India. The study shows that the
    benefits of global trading disappear rapidly when there are restrictions or limited
    participation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) We need to define how the system will work. Although
    governments are need to verify and ensure compliance, we need to insure there is a
    meaningful role for company to company deals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(3) We need to have a framework that will allow us to
    evaluate the effectiveness of a trading system. It took five years from the time Congress
    approved the sulphur dioxide emission trading program until the market started. Greenhouse
    gas emission trading will be order of magnitude more complex and the sooner we start the
    higher probability we will have a functioning system by the 2008 - 2012 timeframe. Given
    the wide range of economic predictions, data from emission trading is needed to forecast
    the impact on the U.S. economy - a condition of the Bryd-Hagel resolution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The study also concludes that the more restrictions on
    trading, the more Europe improves its competitive position - which is probably not a
    surprise to you and your delegation who are veterans in dealing with the EEC.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I will provide you a copy of the full report as soon as it
    becomes available. I f you require further information, please contact Marian Hopkins at
    the Business Roundtable. She can be reached at 202-872-1260.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Limited involvement by developing counties is not
    sufficient. Developing countries must assume binding obligations in the same compliance
    period as Annex I countries (those subject to the constraints of the Protocol) to avoid
    carbon leakage and significant damage to U.S. trade and competitiveness. China and India
    are critical because they will account for over half of non-Annex I emissions and one
    quarter of global emissions by 2020.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br WP="BR1">
    <br WP="BR2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Emissions Trading</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Global emission trading has great potential. Costs could be
    reduced by 75 per cent or more through global trading, but only if the U.S. is able to
    purchase permits to cover 80 to 90 per cent of its required emission reductions. To
    achieve this potential, trading must include all developing countries as full
    participants. If only the Clean Development Mechanism is institute, or if trading does not
    include China and India or places percentage restrictions on purchases, large competitive
    distortions will remain.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">U.S. GDP losses would exceed $60 billion per year from 2010
    onward under any scenario except full global trading. Without global trading, the Kyoto
    Protocol would create permanent disparities in energy costs between Annex I and non-Annex
    I countries. Investment and growth in chemicals and other energy intensive industries is
    likely to shift from Annex I countries to non-Annex I countries where energy is less
    expensive. The U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are likely to bear the most
    damaging trade impacts, and Europe is likely to be spared because of the lower energy
    intensity of European industry. U.S. agriculture is likely to lose world markets to other
    countries because U.S. agriculture is relatively energy intensive.</font></td>
