    Locates Burning Japanese Whaling Ship - First Year Without Antarctic Whale Hunting Since

    vessel Arctic Sunrise has located today the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru drifting in
    the Coral Sea, 640 miles east of Mackay, Queensland (Australia). The Nisshin Maru caught
    fire last Thursday on its way to the Antarctic and has been unable to move since. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Greenpeace ship immediately offered emergency assistance to the
    Nisshin Maru. Messages were exchanged by flag between the two ships. The Nisshin Maru
    indicated that the fire was under control. The Arctic Sunrise was in the area after a
    visit to Ponapei (Micronesia). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Greenpeace is relieved to confirm that the crew of
    the Nisshin Maru is safe now. The events of the past days however put in doubt whether
    Japan's 'scientific' whaling program will go ahead this year,&quot; said John Frizell of
    Greenpeace International. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to a Reuters report published on Tuesday from
    Tokyo, the Japanese 'whaling fleet of five ships may return home early because of a fire
    that disabled the only ship able to process the meat'. &quot;If this information is
    confirmed by the Japanese authorities, the whales of the Southern Ocean will enjoy their
    first year without hunting since Antarctic whaling began in 1904&quot;, added Frizell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Japanese officials claim that the Antarctic whale hunt is
    for scientific research but every year the whale meat is sold on the open market for tens
    of millions of dollars. The 1700 tonnes of whale meat from last year's
    &quot;research&quot; hunt sold in Japanese fish markets for an estimated US$50 million. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;To call this scientific research is an insult to
    science,&quot; said Frizell. &quot;There is no need to kill whales to study them. We have
    been campaigning against whaling for 25 years and we remain committed to ensuring that
    commercial whaling draped in the cloak of &quot;science&quot; is stopped.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Japan has stepped up its efforts to resume full-scale
    commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, despite the fact that is
    has been made into an international sanctuary for whales in 1994 by the International
    Whaling Commission (IWC), forbidding all commercial whaling in the area. At that time,
    Japan was the only member of the IWC to formally object to the Antarctic whale sanctuary. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Four other ships are still clustered around the crippled
    factory ship. One of these, the Yushin Maru, is the first new whaling vessel to be built
    in Japan in 26 years and is on its first voyage. The brand new vessel costs US$12 million,
    has high-powered engines and incorporates the latest equipment. The Japanese press
    described the Yushin Maru as &quot;a symbol for the reopening of whaling&quot; <a href="#one">(1)</a>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Japanese Government is investing millions of
    dollars in the whaling industry&quot;, said Frizell. There is no doubt this research is
    just commercial whaling in disguise&quot;. The Japanese Government also subsidises whale
    meat promotional drives since discovering that many young people don't like it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most recent meeting of the IWC formally noted &quot;the
    grave concerns of eminent members of the international scientific community over the
    continuation of lethal whale research programs&quot;. The IWC has also noted that the
    results of Japan's scientific program are not required for the management of whales. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not the only example of the Japan's fishing
    industry using &quot;science&quot; as a disguise for commercial activities. Earlier this
    year, when an international fisheries management body refused to increase the quota for
    the critically endangered southern bluefin tuna, Japan announced a &quot;scientific
    fishing&quot; program to take an extra 1,400 tonnes of the fish. </font></p>
