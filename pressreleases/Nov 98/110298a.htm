    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">AMSTERDAM -
    November 2 - As governments gather in Buenos Aires to resume talks on how to combat
    climate change, Greenpeace warned that impacts of this global phenomenon are already
    appearing. The melting and retreat of Arctic sea ice is already affecting polar bear
    habitat, and may spell doom for these magnificent creatures in the long run. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The western Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as the rest of
    the globe, as predicted by scientists studying the effect of increased greenhouse gases in
    the atmosphere. The Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre in Norway found a 4.6
    percent decline in ice extent and a 5.8 percent decline in actual ice area between 1978
    and 1994. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During a recent expedition to study wildlife populations,
    Greenpeace's icebreaker, m/v Arctic Sunrise, carried scientists and campaigners to the
    'ice edge' in the Chukchi Sea, that part of the Arctic Ocean between northern Alaska and
    Russia's Chukotka Peninsula. Normally at or near the coast of Alaska, the ship had to sail
    more than 150 miles north to find the edge of the ice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There certainly seems to be genuine increase in
    temperature, and I think the temperatures are indicating that something's going on, &quot;
    said University of Alaska Fairbanks Researcher Lori Quakenbush, who joined the Greenpeace
    expedition. &quot;There are two things that can affect polar bears: one is a change in the
    number of ringed seals for them to feed on, and the other is a change in the accessibility
    of those seals. The ice plays a big role in both of those things.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The food chain the Arctic is short. The algae that
    grows on the bottom of the ice is eaten by zooplankton, which is eaten by arctic cod,
    which are eaten by ringed seals, which are eaten by the polar bears, and that's about as
    simple as a food chain gets. A change in the environment can affect anything along the
    chain,&quot; said Quakenbush. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Polar bears feed nearly exclusively on ringed seals which
    they hunt from the ice edge, or through the pack ice itself. The bears do not catch the
    seals in the water, but wait at holes for them to come through the ice to breathe. The
    retreat of the sea ice also means that more bears may become trapped on or near shore in
    the summer and fall, and are more likely to run afoul of humans and garbage dumps, or in
    the case of Alaska, with the industrial complex associated with oil development on
    Alaska's North Slope. In these encounters, the bears usually lose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If they lose their ice platform, we lose their
    habitat, and we're not going to have any polar bears&quot;, said Dr. Charles Jonkel of the
    U.S. based Great Bear Foundation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Scientists aboard the Arctic Sunrise were surprised by how
    far north the ice edge had retreated. However, this fits with the findings of a recent
    joint Canadian/American expedition where scientists were frozen into the Arctic ice pack
    aboard a Canadian icebreaker north of Alaska for more than a year. Scientists found the
    ice to be much thinner (1.5 metres at most, rather than the 2-3 metres that would be
    expected), and much warmer and less salty due to recent melting of the pack. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Greenpeace's Arctic Expedition leader Steve Sawyer said,
    &quot;The delegates in Buenos Aires have to be reminded that climate change is not
    something which will happen in the future, it is happening now, most dramatically in the
    Arctic. The main cause is clear and undisputed. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
    due to the burning of fossil fuels is accepted as the main cause of climate change by all
    scientists save those working for the fossil fuel industry. Polar bears may be some of the
    earliest victims, but the rest of us are not far behind.&quot; </font></p>
