    across the country reported directly releasing to the air, land, and water nearly 20
    million pounds of lead, mercury, and other of the most dangerous substances known to
    exist, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG and the National Environmental
    Trust.&nbsp; The report, Poisoning Our Future: The Dangerous Legacy of Persistent Toxic
    Chemicals also found that for the most well-known of these substances, this reported
    information accounts for only approximately 9 percent of known releases of those
    chemicals.&nbsp; The release of this report coincides with the U.S. EPA&#146;s efforts to
    reconsider reporting thresholds for certain chemicals.<br>
    <br>
    Mercury, dioxin, lead, and other such chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects,
    reproductive and hormone damage, and other health problems.&nbsp; These persistent and
    bioaccumulative substances are particularly dangerous because they are highly toxic in
    very small quantities, remain in the environment for long periods of time, and build up in
    the tissue of animals and humans.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;U.S. industries continue to pollute our air, land, and water with some of the most
    harmful substances known to exist, yet because of loopholes in the federal reporting law,
    these polluters can leave the public in the dark about the dangerous legacy they are
    creating,&quot; said Allison LaPlante, U.S. PIRG toxics advocate and a co-author of the
    report .<br>
    <br>
    Other major findings of the report include:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The top ten states for releases of metal
        persistent bioaccumulative toxins were:&nbsp; MO, MT,&nbsp; AZ,&nbsp; IL, UT, TX, OH, ID,
        IN, PA. &nbsp; The top ten states for releases of non-metal persistent bioaccumulative
        toxins are: &nbsp; FL, NY, MI, MO, IL, MA, WV, TX, LA, WA.<br>
        </font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">1996 TRI data accounted for approximately 8
        percent of mercury emissions, 35 percent of lead air emissions, and 5 percent of
        hexachlorobenzene air emissions.&nbsp; Perhaps most problematic, dioxin, although widely
        regarded as the most toxic chemical, is currently not even on the reporting list.<br>
        </font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because reporting thresholds are set too
        high, 1996 TRI data accounted for approximately 30 percent of the industries potentially
        releasing these substances to the air, land and water.&nbsp; <br>
        </font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Major sources of persistent bioaccumulative
        toxins reported to 1996 TRI include: primary metals industry, chemical manufacturing,
        stone, glass, clay, and concrete production, and the food products industry.<br>
        </font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">U.S. PIRG and the National Environmental Trust
    analyzed releases of 31 toxic substances known to persist in the environment and
    bioaccumulate in animals and wildlife, as reported to the Community Right to Know
    Act&#146;s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) in 1996, the most recent year for which data is
    available. However, much of the pollution is not included in TRI, because current
    thresholds that trigger reporting requirements are set too high. The groups used several
    EPA studies to estimate the actual releases of five of the most well-known of these
    substances.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;The nation&#146;s best reporting law tells us almost nothing about those chemicals
    that present the greatest threat to public health and the environment. We have the Right
    to Know about any releases of these substances into the environment, &quot; said Tom
    Natan, Research Director for the National Environmental Trust.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water quality, upon the advice of
    dozens of leading scientists, has declared that &#145;persistent toxic substances are too
    dangerous to the biosphere and to humans to permit their release in any
    quantity&#146;,&quot; said LaPlante of U.S. PIRG. &quot;We should be working to eliminate
    these substances, yet the public, policy makers, and even industry themselves, do not have
    the information needed to track or promote pollution prevention.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    More than 150 members of Congress cosponsored Right to Know expansion legislation, &nbsp;
    including a provision to lower reporting thresholds for persistent and bioaccumulative
    substances.&nbsp; U.S. PIRG is calling on the Clinton Administration and the EPA to take
    critical steps to reduce the use and release of these dangerous substances.&nbsp;
    Specifically, the Clinton Administration and the EPA should:<br>
    <br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower Right to Know reporting thresholds to include
    information on all persistent or bioaccumulative toxins, and add dioxins to the reporting
    list. EPA should set a single zero threshold for reporting of these extremely dangerous
    substances;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Right to Know reporting to include: all major
    sources of pollution, as well as information on toxic chemicals used in the workplace,
    transported through communities, and placed in consumer products; and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take steps to eliminate the use and release of substances
    like mercury and dioxin by setting strict emissions standards for mercury from power
    plants, allowing for no new development of major polluting practices such as waste
    incineration, and phasing out any industrial chlorine process that results in the
    formation of dioxin.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As the EPA considers changes to Right to Know reporting requirements, we are calling
    on Administrator Browner and her staff to stand strong against the pressure from polluting
    industries that have been fighting the public&#146;s Right to Know for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;
    If we are working in the dark, we can not hope to find the solution.&quot; said LaPlante.</font></p>
