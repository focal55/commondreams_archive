    November 4 - </font><i><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Statement by Gloria Feldt, President
    Planned Parenthood Action Fund </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Election 1998 was a resounding confirmation of American's
    support for family planning and a woman's right to choose. Victories by Chuck Schumer in
    New York, John Edwards in North Carolina, Barbara Boxer in California, Patty Murray in
    Washington, and Russ Feingold in Wisconsin are tremendous wins for women, sending a clear
    message that pro-choice voters will not tolerate an erosion of their constitutional
    rights.<br>
    <br>
    The victories in this election are particularly gratifying because of the hurdles that had
    to be cleared. Tens of millions of dollars were invested by anti-choice groups in favor of
    candidates who would deny a woman's right to choose abortion and her access to family
    planning programs. Anti-choice groups made no gains in the Senate despite all their
    rhetoric and all their campaigning.<br>
    <br>
    The Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) spent more than $1 million in what was the
    largest electoral project we had ever undertaken. PPAF endorsed 160 U.S. House and Senate
    candidates, 127 of whom received our PAC contributions ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Top
    PAC recipients include: Senate candidates Barbara Boxer, Chuck Schumer, Russ Feingold, and
    Patty Murray; House candidates include Joe Hoeffel (PA-13), Lane Evans (IL-17), Tom Udall
    (NM-3), Brian Baird (WA-3); Lois Capps (CA-22), Dennis Moore (KS-3), Loretta Sanchez
    (CA-46), Shelley Berkley (NV-1), Baron Hill (IN-9), and Maurice Hinchey (NY-26), all of
    whom won.<br>
    <br>
    PPAF also targeted key swing House districts for independent expenditure campaigns that
    included voter identification, direct mail, and phonebanks to pro-choice voters. Each
    independent expenditure had a budget of at least $70,000 and included 7 contacts to each
    voter. Our efforts to energize our supporters and identify candidates' positions on choice
    and family planning have been tremendously successful, including the following winners:
    PA-13: Joe Hoeffel; NM-3: Tom Udall; IL-17: Lane Evans; and WA-3: Brian Baird. Planned
    Parenthood's statewide Action Fund in California conducted an extensive independent
    expenditure for Senator Barbara Boxer, including 150,000 slate mailers and a
    groundbreaking website.<br>
    <br>
    The recent acts of domestic terrorism, particularly the assassination of Dr. Barnett
    Slepian, along with the continuation of virulent anti-choice rhetoric, have energized our
    core constituency. We are proud to say that pro-choice voters have honored the memory of
    Dr. Slepian by electing representatives who will help create a climate where women and
    their families can safely make responsible choices.<br>
    <br>
    Most Americans support abortion rights and access to family planning. The Congress for too
    long has drifted from the wants and needs of the American public. Our job now will be to
    work harder to assure that more candidates who reflect the values of most Americans are
    elected in 2000.<br>
    <br>
    Americans know better than to be swayed by anti-choice rhetoric and their votes show that
    logic prevails. We just need to ensure that the same logic prevails when Congress
    reconvenes. Members of Congress need to stay alert to what their constituents are saying
    about reproductive health and rights. We at Planned Parenthood pledge to help them stay in
    touch with the true pulse of America.</font></p>
