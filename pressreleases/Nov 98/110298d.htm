    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    November 2 - More than 700 members of ADAPT, the national disability rights organization,
    are shutting down the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican parties the day before
    Americans vote in midterm elections to send the message that they want a choice in where
    they live.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Enough excuses, no more pilot
    projects,&quot; said Stephanie Thomas, an ADAPT national organizer and member of the
    group's Texas chapter. &quot;We will no longer tolerate the segregation forcing us into
    nursing homes and other institutions.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Democrats are at 430 South Capitol St., S.W., and the
    Republicans are at 310 First St., S.E. The action takes place at lunchtime today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They are demanding both parties develop a party plank in
    cooperation with ADAPT that: 1) The party recognize that the current Medicaid
    &quot;long-term care&quot; system is institutionally biased and that home- and
    community-based services should be the first priority; and 2) both parties embrace the
    mandate in the Americans with Disabilities Act that services be provided in &quot;the most
    integrated setting&quot; -- which means home and community-based care. They also want the
    parties to support legislation allowing people to choose where and how long-term services
    and supports are delivered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to address these demands, the group wants time
    for15 ADAPT representatives to address the parties' platform committees, and schedule one
    representative to address delegates at the parties' respective presidential conventions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as civil rights advocates once demanded political
    candidates heed their issues, disability rights advocates now want their opportunity to
    live in freedom -- freedom from nursing homes and the ability to choose where they wish to
    live.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The action is the first in a four-day series of protests at
    which disabled Americans will take action and get arrested as part of ADAPT's Campaign for
    REAL Choice. The campaign is about getting a national system of home- and community-based
    attendant services.That means help with things like eating, dressing and transferring in
    homes they rent or own.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the ADA's &quot;most integrated setting&quot;
    mandate, 80 percent of all Medicaid long-term care dollars goes to institutional care
    while a mere 20 percent supports people living in the community. Medicaid currently is
    spending $45 billion a year to literally warehouse 2 million Americans. Many of them do
    not need medical care in particular but rather require attendant services, such as
    transport from bed to wheelchair, eating, dressing and toileting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under federal Medicaid policy, nursing homes are a mandated
    service and attended care is not. Many states have found that community-based attendant
    care is less expensive than institutional care. Oregon, which has aggressively sought
    waivers from Medicaid to de-institutionalize its disabled citizens since 1982, found they
    could serve three people in the community for every one in a nursing home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now more than 5,000 strong nationally, ADAPT has chapters
    in more than 32 cities and 27 states and is growing daily. ADAPT, which played an
    instrumental grassroots role in pushing through the Americans with Disabilities Act, is
    fighting to change a climate that favors nursing homes over people.</font></p>
