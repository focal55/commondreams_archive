    <td align="left" valign="top" width="445" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON -
    November 3 - The full force of the national disability rights organization ADAPT's 700
    members from 29 states is taking over the Department of Health and Human Services to make
    the administration enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act mandate that they receive
    supports in &quot;the most integrated setting.&quot;</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
    building is at 330 Independence Ave., S.W. and the action, like yesterday's takeover of
    the Democratic and Republican party headquarters, takes place at lunchtime today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Today the group is at HHS to demand that the president
    submit a FY 1999 budget that includes a major initiative revamping long-term services for
    disabled Americans - in other words, money to support community-based attendant services
    so disabled people can live in their own homes they either own or rent instead of nursing
    homes. In addition, they want HHS to rigorously enforce the &quot;most integrated
    setting&quot; mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is a civil rights law
    for the disabled. While bureaucrats have been promising members of the disabled community
    action, they have been talking out of the other side of their mouths to state Medicaid
    directors by discouraging them from providing community-based care.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We're here because of one broken administration
    promise after another. Since 1992 the Clinton administration from the president on down
    has promised and promised and promised,&quot; said Mark Johnson of ADAPT's Atlanta
    chapter. In 1992, when candidate Clinton met with ADAPT members in San Francisco, he
    pledged to create a personal assistance service program. It was the first in a series of
    broken promises. Yesterday the same organization took over the Democratic and Republican
    Party headquarters until both organizations' officials signed agreements to develop a
    party plank in cooperation with ADAPT to recognize that the current Medicaid
    &quot;long-term care&quot; system is institutionally biased and that home and
    community-based services should be the first priority. Each also agreed to discuss
    allowing ADAPT representatives to address the parties' platform committees and scheduling
    one representative to address the parties' respective presidential conventions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Today's action is the second in a four-day series of
    protests at which disabled Americans will take action and get arrested as part of ADAPT's
    Campaign for REAL Choice. The campaign is about getting a national system of home and
    community-based attendant services. That means help with things like eating, dressing, and
    transferring in homes they rent or own.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the ADA's &quot;most integrated setting&quot;
    mandate, 80 percent of all Medicaid long-term care dollars goes to institutional care
    while a mere 20 percent support people living in the community. Medicaid currently is
    spending $45 billion a year to literally warehouse 2 million Americans. Many of them do
    not need medical care in particular but rather require attendant services, such as
    transport from bed to wheelchair, eating, dressing, and toileting. Under federal Medicaid
    policy, nursing homes are a mandated service and attendant care is not. Many states have
    found that community-based attendant care is less expensive than institutional care.
    Oregon, which has aggressively sought waivers from Medicaid to de-institutionalize its
    disabled citizens since 1982, found they could serve three people in the community for
    every one in a nursing home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now more than 5,000 strong nationally, ADAPT has chapters
    in more than 32 cities and 27 states and is growing daily. ADAPT, which played an
    instrumental grassroots role in pushing through the Americans with Disabilities Act, is
    fighting to change a climate that favors nursing homes over people.</font></p>
