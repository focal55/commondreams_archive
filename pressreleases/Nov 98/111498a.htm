    today expressed deep concern that Environmental Ministers allowed national economic
    concerns to block progress on addressing the problem of climate change. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This is turning into a trade and economic negotiation
    - climate is getting pushed further and further down the agenda. Science is being replaced
    by carbon trading markets as the driver for the talks. &quot; said Bill Hare, Climate
    Policy Director, Greenpeace International. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Consideration of the issue at the very heart of the
    climate convention - whether existing commitments to cut emissions are sufficient to
    protect the climate - was aborted - no decision on this vital issue was made. This is of
    very deep concern to Greenpeace,&quot; said Hare. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final agreement after two weeks of negotiations and an
    all night session was the most basic agreement on a workplan for further work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The most consistent thing about these talks has been
    the thick fog of jargon. This has obscured the real issue - escalating greenhouse gas
    emissions. The real work remains to be done at home: fossil fuel investment is expanding,
    subsidies to polluting industries continue - that is what governments can act on
    immediately. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Within the timetable agreed are embedded important and
    controversial issues </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- the means and timing of introduction of market mechanisms
    - the so-called &quot;flexmex&quot; (emissions trading, joint implementation and clean
    development mechanism). These will be negotiated and agreed by COP6 in two years time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- progress on funding and means for accelerating technology
    transfer to the South </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- funding adaptation to the impacts of climate change for
    the most vulnerable countries, which is linked to proposals that countries with fossil
    fuel dependent economies should receive compensation if their economies are impacted (e.g.
    OPEC) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One potentially significant area of progress was the
    agreement on compliance. It was agreed to establish a process to negotiate a legal regime
    to ensure that parties meet their agreements under the Kyoto Protocol and the penalties
    for failing to comply , i.e. this will determine whether the Protocol has real teeth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There has been only minor progress on two other issues: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* Sinks - agreed to defer potentially bad decisions -
    forestry planting offsets - until the year 2000 when the IPCC Special Report is completed
    and considered by the Parties. The IPCC Special Report will consider the scientific and
    technical issues surrounding the role of sinks in meeting Kyoto Protocol obligations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* HFCs - agreed to hold a workshop to collate information
    on ways to limit emissions from the use of HFCs. Currently emissions of HFCs - a very
    strong set of greenhouse gases - are rising. This is therefore an implicit acknowledgment
    by parties that these are not desirable alternatives to the ozone depleting substances.
    HFC 134a is for example 1300 to 3300 times stronger than CO2 in terms of its global
    warming potential. Information on limiting PFCs will also be collated at this workshop. </font></p>
