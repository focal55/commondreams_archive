    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2">BUENOS
    AIRES, ARGENTINA - November 6 - The extinction of plant and animal species, and climate
    change caused by human activities are two of the most important environmental problems
    facing the planet. While these issues - biodiversity loss and climate change - have
    generally been addressed independently of one another, a new report released today in
    Buenos Aires, Argentina, at the meeting of the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the
    United Nations Convention on Climate Change, shows that the two concerns are intricately
    linked. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report, <i><b><a href="http://www.wri.org/ffi/climate/">Climate, Biodiversity, and Forests: Issues and
    Opportunities Emerging From the Kyoto Protocol</a></b></i>, released jointly by the
    Washington, DC-based World Resources Institute (WRI), and The World Conservation
    Union-IUCN, examines why, with so much at stake, the role of forests and land-use change
    under the Kyoto Protocol remains controversial, and attempts to clarify the issues. Most
    importantly, the report notes that climate change itself is a major threat to
    biodiversity, causing species loss and ecosystems destruction, and explains that
    protecting biological diversity may, in fact, help mitigate other impacts of climate
    change. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;One of the most important areas yet to be resolved
    under the Kyoto Protocol, concerns how much of a role forests and land-use change will
    play. They are both a part of the problem and of the solution of climate change,&quot;
    says <a href="http://www.wri.org/staff/paigb.html">Paige Brown</a>, a WRI research analyst
    and the report's author. She adds that, &quot;Saving or increasing forest cover,
    particularly of old-growth forests, stores carbon, thus keeping it out of the atmosphere
    and slowing global warming.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report stresses that while energy-sector emissions are
    the predominant contributor of the climate change problem globally, forest conversion and
    other land-use practices are also significant, contributing some 20 percent of annual
    carbon dioxide emissions. Over the past 150 years, this has resulted in an estimated 30
    percent of the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide. The repercussions are great.
    Consider the following: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In much of the world, far more forests (especially
        tropical), are being lost than protected. With at least 50 percent of the world's
        approximately 14 million species residing in tropical forests, once the trees are gone,
        these species too disappear forever. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The rapid loss of forests is doubly damaging - adding to the
        global burden of atmospheric carbon dioxide and undermining the world's biological
        resources, which in turn reduces the resilience of ecosystems faced with a changing
        climate. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some species already on the verge of extinction could be
        pushed over the edge as their habitats disappear because of climatic changes. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More droughts and floods that may be influenced by climate
        change will also make poor communities even more vulnerable. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When forests are burned or otherwise destroyed, carbon is
        released into the atmosphere. For every forest or other ecosystem that is spared this
        fate, carbon is stored and kept out of the atmosphere. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the report stresses that failing to address one
    issue will only exacerbate the problems caused by the other and that measures taken to
    solve climate change can be more effective if undertaken in conjunction with efforts to
    prevent the loss of global biodiversity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So the question remains: Can the world community respond to
    these dire threats to the global environment? Brown argues that it can, but cautions that
    many important questions remain unanswered about the role of forests and land-use change
    in meeting obligations to slow global warming. Now, as the Conference of Parties meets to
    consider such obligations, Climate, Biodiversity, and Forests will be useful in
    encouraging necessary international commitments and concerted action. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Without a much stronger commitment to solving climate
    change and biodiversity loss, we will bequeath to our children and grandchildren an
    irretrievably impoverished world,&quot; WRI President Jonathan Lash and IUCN Director
    General David McDowell, warn in a joint statement. &quot;Such a fate can be avoided, but
    it requires a strong international commitment and concerted action.&quot; </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The World Resources Institute is a Washington, DC-based
    center for policy research and technical assistance on global environmental and
    development issues. It provides objective information and practical proposals for policy
    change that will foster environmentally sound development. WRI works with institutions in
    more than 50 countries to bring the insights of scientific research, economic analysis and
    practical experience to political, business and non-governmental organization leaders
    globally. Climate, Biodiversity and Forests: Issues and Opportunities Emerging From the
    Kyoto Protocol is a special release that bridges the issues of climate and biodiversity.
    It is a collaboration between WRI's Climate program and WRI's Frontier Forest Initiative
    (FFI), a multi-disciplinary effort to promote stewardship in and around the world's last
    major frontier forests by influencing investment, policy, and public opinion. For

    throughout the world and works with six expert networks grouping more than 12,000 people.
    IUCN seeks to influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve
    the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is
    equitable and ecologically sustainable. Issues of climate change and its relationship to
    biological diversity are managed through IUCN's office in Washington, DC. For additional
