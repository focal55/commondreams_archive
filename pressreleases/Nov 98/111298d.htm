    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 12 - </font>The Sierra
    Club announced today that it has received a three-year grant from the San Francisco-based
    Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund for $900,000 to support the organization's international
    Human Rights and the Environment Campaign.&nbsp; Amnesty International, a campaign
    partner, received a grant for the same amount.&nbsp; The gift will be used by the groups
    to defend threatened environmentalists worldwide and to push for stronger US foreign
    policy support and protection of environmental activists abroad.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are very excited about this new partnership with Amnesty International and by the
    good work this generous grant makes possible,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive Director
    Carl Pope.&nbsp; &quot;We'll be using the money to continue to shame irresponsible
    multinational corporations and repressive governments into respecting the environment and
    the rights of people to protect it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is the kind of leadership we have come to expect from the Goldman Fund,&quot;
    said Pope, &quot;and that's why we have been so proud to serve as a nominating
    organization for the Goldman Environmental Prize, the world's largest financial award for
    grassroots environmental heroes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Sierra Club's Human Rights and the Environment Campaign was established in 1993
    following the&nbsp; harassment and arrest of prominent Kenyan environmental advocate Prof.
    Wangari Maathai.&nbsp; The Club has since waged vocal campaigns on behalf of the Ogoni
    people of Nigeria, including a rarely-used member boycott of Royal/Dutch Shell, and on
    behalf of former Soviet submarine captain Alexander Nikitin who has been charged with
    espionage by Russian authorities for exposing illegal nuclear waste dumping in the Arctic.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The purpose of our joint campaign with Amnesty International is to secure for our
    colleagues abroad the same rights we have in this country to speak out on behalf of the
    environment,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Sierra Club's International Program Director.
    &nbsp; &quot;We'll be pushing the Clinton administration to recognize the role that
    environmentalists have in promoting democracy abroad and we'll provide direct support for
    activists who are threatened because of their environmental advocacy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Sierra Club and Amnesty International are not the only organizations to receive
    funding from the Goldman Fund to pursue the human rights and environment link.&nbsp; The
    Washington, DC-based Center for International Environmental Law,&nbsp; EarthRights
    International based in Washington, DC and Bangkok, and a team of three San Francisco-based
    organizations --&nbsp; the Natural Heritage Institute, Human Rights Advocates and the
    Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development, all received substantial
    grants from the Goldman Fund.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Goldman Fund is providing the resources we need to support volunteer activists
    who know that the US acting alone cannot solve all of the planet's environmental
    ills,&quot; said Mills.&nbsp; &quot;From global warming, to air and water pollution,
    citizens from around the world must be involved if we are to succeed in protecting the
    environment for our families and for our future.&quot;</font></p>
