    Rights Watch today called on the British Home Secretary, Jack Straw, to hold General
    Augusto Pinochet for extradition if the House of Lords rules that he is not immune from
    prosecution as a former head of state. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The House of
    Lords' decision on whether Pinochet enjoys absolute immunity from suit in England will be
    delivered on Wednesday, November 25. If the Lords rule that he is not immune for the
    thousands of killings, disappearances&quot; and acts of torture committed under his
    command, the extradition requests of Spain, France and Switzerland will come before the
    British government. The Chilean government is pressing the U.K. to release General
    Pinochet on &quot;humanitarian&quot; grounds even if the Lords rule against him. Chile has
    sent high-level representatives to London and postponed talks over the purchase of
    frigates from Britain worth about $100 million. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch called on the Home Secretary to resist

<!--TEXT-->    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">16 November 1998<br>
    The Honourable Jack Straw<br>
    Secretary of State for the Home Department <br>
    50 Queen Anne's Gate<br>
    London SW1H 9AT<br>
    United Kingdom </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Home Secretary:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We write concerning the requested extradition of Gen.
    Augusto Pinochet. As we did in our letter of October 19, Human Rights Watch again wishes
    to commend the United Kingdom for allowing the arrest of General Pinochet on the Spanish
    warrant. We have followed the House of Lords proceedings carefully, submitting legal
    briefs to the Law Lords and attending each court session. Should the Lords reverse the
    High Court decision that invalidated the arrest, we respectfully urge you to take the
    principled actions necessary to ensure that General Pinochet is extradited to Spain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We understand that the Extradition Act grants you
    discretion to decline extradition, for example where extradition would, having regard to
    all the circumstances, be &quot;unjust or oppressive.&quot; The reasonable exercise of
    your discretion requires that you take into account the gravity of General Pinochet's
    offenses, the impunity which General Pinochet would continue to enjoy on returning to
    Chile, and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The systematic human rights violations committed under
    General Pinochet's command amount to crimes against humanity. Official Chilean
    investigations have confirmed that more than 3,100 people were victims of extrajudicial
    execution or &quot;disappearance.&quot; Thousands of others were victims of torture,
    arbitrary detention, forced exile, or other abuses. Indeed, torture of political detainees
    in clandestine detention centers was systematic throughout the Pinochet regime, often
    overseen by doctors expert in keeping victims barely alive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">International law - as well as the prevention of future
    atrocities - demands the prosecution of those responsible for such crimes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In April 1978, however, the Chilean military granted itself
    a general amnesty from prosecution and punishment for its crimes. The self-amnesty covers
    the period when most of the worst abuses took place, from the coup in September 1973 to
    March 1978. The Chilean Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the measure's
    constitutionality. The Chilean government has touted one recent Supreme Court decision
    that one investigation of alleged &quot;war crimes&quot; committed by the military before
    1978 could proceed. But in the Chilean legal system, this single case does not establish
    any precedent for subsequent legal action. Indeed, in a later case, the Supreme Court
    again upheld the amnesty above international human rights law. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Similarly, General Pinochet will not be indicted,
    prosecuted or punished in Chile for human rights crimes committed after the period covered
    by the self-amnesty. As &quot;senator-for-life,&quot; a bargain for leaving office in
    1990, Pinochet is protected from such prosecutions. Theoretically, the Chilean Supreme
    Court could strip him of this immunity, if it found him guilty of criminal acts. But since
    the military left office in 1990, the court has never deprived a member of congress of
    immunity. In any case, any indictment of General Pinochet in Chile would surely lead
    military tribunals to claim jurisdiction over the matter, another guarantee that he will
    never face justice. In past civilian-military conflicts over jurisdiction, Chile's Supreme
    Court has readily acceded to such demands from the military. Military courts are staffed
    by current and former military officers whom Pinochet either promoted or appointed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Britain is also under an international obligation to try or
    extradite persons accused of the horrible crimes at issue here. This obligation is set
    forth, inter alia, in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
    Treatment or Punishment, to which the United Kingdom is a party. Torture is one of the
    charges on which General Pinochet's extradition is sought. As a party to the European
    Convention on Human Rights, the United Kingdom also has an obligation to ensure access to
    justice for the victims of General Pinochet's crimes. Several European countries have sent
    the unequivocal message that they believe General Pinochet should stand trial. Spain,
    France and Switzerland have all requested his extradition. Returning the general to Chile
    would deprive his victims in these countries of their right to a remedy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">General Pinochet's lawyers argued in the House of Lords
    that Britain should defer to the &quot;arrangement&quot; reached in Chile which included
    the military's self-amnesty. We strongly believe, however, that the international
    community has a greater long-term interest in making it clear to those who would use
    violence to seize power that they face punishment if they embark on crimes against
    humanity. There is little chance of preventing such terrible crimes if their authors know
    that at the end of the day they can bargain for an amnesty and escape punishment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the gravity of General Pinochet's offenses, the
    impunity he enjoys in Chile and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law,
    we respectfully submit that there are no circumstances by which the extradition of
    Pinochet to Spain could reasonably be considered either &quot;unjust or oppressive.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sincerely, </font></p>
