    Watch today released the results of a 2-year investigation of allegations that a chemical
    agent was used against Bosniaks fleeing Srebrenica during the war in Bosnia and
    Hercegovina in July 1995. Short of conclusive evidence that a chemical agent was used,
    Human Rights Watch called today for a broader international investigation of the
    allegations in order to bring justice to the victims, strengthen international controls
    over the proliferation of chemical weapons, and prevent a dangerous arms race in the
    former Yugoslavia.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the 54-page report, Chemical
    Warfare in Bosnia? The Strange Experiences of the Srebrenica Survivors, does not present
    conclusive proof substantiating the allegations, Human Rights Watch has documented the
    following: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the summer of 1995, shortly after the fall of the United
    Nations-designated &quot;safe area&quot; of Srebrenica, survivors emerged from a long trek
    to safety with accounts that they had been attacked during their flight with some type of
    chemical weapon, possibly an incapacitating agent called BZ. (This agent was originally
    developed by the United States in the 1960s but was never used). Their column had been
    attacked by Bosnian Serb forces commanded by Gen. Ratko Mladi. </font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Survivors gave consistent descriptions to Human Rights Watch
        of mortar shells that produced a &quot;strange smoke&quot; of various colors which did not
        rise but spread out slowly. Following these attacks, some of the marchers&#151;the numbers
        are unclear&#151;began to hallucinate and behave in an irrational manner, with some even
        killing their friends or themselves. So far the behavior following these attacks has
        defied explanation, including by experts on war-related stress. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The army of the former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav People's
        Army (JNA), is known to have possessed incapacitating agents, including BZ, and to have
        developed doctrine and delivery systems for BZ. The situation that confronted the people
        fleeing Srebrenica matched the scenario for which the use of incapacitating chemical
        agents was prescribed in a JNA military manual. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The United States government apparently took the allegations
        seriously enough to conduct an investigation, reported to have taken place in late 1996 or
        early 1997. The results of this investigation have not been made public, but in late 1996
        or early 1997 the U.S. intelligence community was reported to have information suggesting
        that chemical weapons may have been used in Srebrenica. The U.S. government's refusal to
        release the findings may, according to a U.S. official interviewed by Human Rights Watch,
        be based on a belief that making this information public might hurt the international
        effort to effect peace in the former Yugoslavia.<br>
        </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following interviews with some thirty-five survivors
        as well as U.N. and other international personnel in the former Yugoslavia, and a review
        of documentation available in 1996-97 relating to events at Srebrenica, Human Rights Watch
        has found the evidence, while suggestive of the use of BZ or a similar chemical
        incapacitant, still incomplete. Most of those reported to have been affected by the
        &quot;strange smoke&quot; apparently never reached Tuzla and could therefore not be
        interviewed; they are presumed dead. Physical evidence, including chemical traces in
        shells or the clothes of people who died during the march and whose bodies were exhumed
        subsequently, has remained elusive. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a March 1997 report, Clouds of War: Chemical Weapons in
        the Former Yugoslavia, Human Rights Watch disclosed that it had uncovered evidence that
        the JNA had an extensive and sophisticated chemical weapons program prior to the breakup
        of Yugoslavia in 1991 that included nerve and mustard gasses, but also incapacitating
        agents like BZ; that the army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
        Montenegro) inherited much of this program; and that the army of Bosnia and Hercegovina
        produced crude chemical munitions during the Bosnian war (1992-95). Human Rights Watch
        also revealed that it had strong indications that the army of the Federal Republic of
        Yugoslavia was continuing to maintain an offensive chemical weapons capability throughout
        the 1990s. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only state in Europe not to have
        signed the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As sponsor of the Dayton Accords, the international
        community has a vital stake in the accords' success. Silence on the question whether Serb
        forces used chemical weapons will give the perpetrators a sense of impunity, and may
        therefore encourage them to resort to chemical weapons again in any future fighting.
        Moreover, Yugoslavia's failure to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention may undermine
        treaty compliance by other Balkan states. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to
        investigate allegations that chemical weapons were used in Srebrenica. The U.N. Security
        Council should instruct U.N. agencies, such as the Organization for the Prohibition of
        Chemical Weapons, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and the
        Office of the United Nations Secretary-General, to do so. It should also call for the
        release of all information on the development, production, stockpiling, and use of
        chemical weapons in the former Yugoslavia which international alliances and their member
        states, including troop contributors of the now-defunct United Nations Protection Force
        (UNPROFOR) and NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), as well as the Stabilisation Force
        (SFOR) and the International Police Task Force (both currently operating in Bosnia), may
        have in their possession.</font></p>
