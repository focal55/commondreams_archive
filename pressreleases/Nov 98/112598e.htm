    decision by the UK House of Lords to reverse the High Court ruling which granted immunity
    to Augusto Pinochet is a landmark breakthrough against impunity, Amnesty International
    said. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The decision -- which could open the way to
    Augusto Pinochet's extradition to Spain --could eventually lead to the former General
    having to face a court of justice to determine his guilt or innocence on the thousands of
    cases of torture, killing and &quot;disappearance&quot; that took place during Augusto
    Pinochet's time in power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The next crucial step is for Jack Straw, UK Home
    Secretary, to stand by the request to issue an extradition warrant, and not to take any
    steps which could prevent the competent courts of justice to render a decision on the
    charges against the former General,&quot; the organization stressed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to its historic importance, the Lords' ruling
    is a welcomed development for the families of the thousands of people who were tortured,
    killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the military government in Chile. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Unlike Augusto Pinochet, the victims and their
    relatives have not enjoyed the benefit of a proper judicial process. This is why more than
    25 years after the tragic events, the international community has become the only recource
    for those affected.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amnesty International is now calling for reforms of UK
    legislation which could be interpreted as a bar to the obligation under international law
    to try any person suspected of crimes against humanity. The organization also asks that
    the UK authorities cooperate with any state that has decided to prosecute people
    responsible for crimes against humanity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Today's ruling -- just a few weeks away from the 50th
    Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on 10 December -- reaffirms the
    international community's commitment towards the fulfilment of basic human rights for
    all.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Background</b><br>
    Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London on 17 October 1998 was the result of a commission
    rogatoire (official petition) to question him filed by judge Baltazar Garzón of the
    Spanish National High Court (Audiencia Nacional). Judge Garzón had been investigating
    cases of human rights violations constituting crimes against humanity committed in Chile
    under Augusto Pinochet's regime. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On 28 October 1998 the UK High Court declared his detention
    unlawful on the grounds that he enjoyed immunity from prosecution as a former head of
    state. An appeal of the High Court judgement was subsequently brought before the House of
    Lords to address the legal concerns surrounding the arrest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The armed forces under Augusto Pinochet's command
    implemented a policy based in systematic and massive human rights violations and
    large-scale repression, exerting absolute control over the resources of the State and
    using these to commit human rights violations, passing repressive laws, denying victims
    judicial remedies, using the judicial system to persecute opponents, placing society in a
    situation of total defencelessness and generating an atmosphere of terror among the
    population. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These crimes against humanity committed through State
    terrorism activities, according to international law, are subjected to the principles of
    universal jurisdiction. Also, the Organic Law of the Judiciary and the Spanish Penal Code
    contain provisions granting jurisdiction to the Spanish judges to try these crimes. </font></p>
