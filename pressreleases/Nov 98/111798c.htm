    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 17 - </font>Following is a statement by Ralph Nader,
    on the &quot;A Citizen's Guide to Impeachment,&quot; released today:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United
    States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason,
    bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors -- Article II, Section 4 of the U.S.
    Constitution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Talk show hosts, a bevy of academics and politicians of
    every variety are bombarding the nation with competing notions of just what the framers of
    the Constitution had in mind when they drafted these 31 words in Article II.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The debate is loud -- and often highly partisan -- but it
    is doing little to inform the public or to develop a consensus about when and where the
    impeachment powers can be properly exercised. There seems to be agreement even among
    President Clinton's most faithful supporters that, at a minimum, the President's conduct
    was improper -- or in the words of some, &quot;reprehensible.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Facing the Congress are allegations that the President may
    have committed perjury, suborned perjury and obstructed justice in an effort to cover up
    his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. But many argue that these acts, even if proven,
    are not impeachable offenses since they involved &quot;personal conduct&quot; and not the
    conduct of the constitutional office of the Presidency.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Complicating the effort for the public and the Congress to
    agree on the Clinton case is the fact that so little precedent exists to guide the
    impeachment process. The only President actually impeached by the House of Representatives
    was President Andrew Johnson, who escaped conviction in the Senate by a single vote. More
    recently in 1974, of course, the House Judiciary Committee voted articles of impeachment
    against President Nixon, but Nixon resigned before the issues reached the floor of the
    House of Representatives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Neither the Andrew Johnson nor the Richard Nixon
    impeachment efforts provide much guidance for what the framers of the Constitution called
    &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; in Article II. And on the vagueness of those
    words hangs the fate of the impeachment of President Clinton. The confusion and
    misinformation which surrounds the heated disagreements over Article II's application to
    President Clinton makes a new book by Alan Hirsch -- &quot;A Citizen's Guide to
    Impeachment&quot; -- extremely valuable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hirsch, a free-lance writer and constitutional scholar out
    of Yale Law School, cuts away the partisan underbrush of the current debate and
    dispassionately lays out an understandable rendition of what the impeachment process is
    and what it is not. This 40-page guide is a first-class road map through the impeachment
    issues for citizens who have grown weary and confused by the overblown and often
    misinformed rhetoric of the partisans and television's talking heads.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hirsch's love for the Constitution is obvious and, unlike
    some, he holds Section 4, Article II in great respect despite the framers' failure to give
    us a definition of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Impeachment is a pillar, at once an expression and
    means of protecting our hard-earned and ever precious liberty,&quot; he writes. &quot;Even
    the President, who commands our armed forces and controls our nuclear weaponry, who flies
    in Air Force I and lives in luxury at the public expense, even this most powerful and
    privileged person can be brought to heel if he abuses the trust we place in him.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But, even the Constitution, Hirsch concedes, can be misused
    and he is quick to warn that there is a &quot;less splendid&quot; side the impeachment
    power.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As many of Clinton's defenders argue, there is a danger
    that the impeachment power can be used to negate voters' decisions at the ballot box or,
    in Hirsch's words, &quot;to bludgeon a President one dislikes or disapproves.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hirsch argues that most historians believe that the
    impeachment efforts against President Johnson were largely based on disagreements with
    Congress, &quot;smacking of politics and partisanship.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result, Hirsch sees the impeachment process as a
    &quot;double edged&quot; sword that when used properly serves to reflect and serve the
    nation's deepest ideals. But, when used improperly for partisan purposes, it can undermine
    those very ideals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If elections can be undone by &quot;sham procedures,&quot;
    we will in effect have a &quot;palace coup,&quot; he writes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While Hirsch sees the Johnson impeachment as a partisan
    misuse of the impeachment power, he regards the impeachment effort against President Nixon
    in 1974 as justified and a proper use of the power.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The author sees President Clinton's current situation as
    being somewhere between the cases of Johnson and Nixon. He describes the Clinton
    impeachment efforts as &quot;murkier and more nuanced&quot; than these two major cases and
    argues, as a result, &quot;we need to be especially careful&quot; in the current case.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alan Hirsch's book should be at the desk of every member of
    the House Judiciary Committee. It may one of the few objective guides available in what
    seems certain to be a partisan donnybrook. For the people, the guide will provide a handy
    road map on all aspects of the impeachment and an excellent means to double check the
    pronouncements of the ubiquitous television analysts.</font></p>

    to Impeachment&quot; from Essential Books, P.O. Box 19405, Washington, D.C. 20036 -- $10
