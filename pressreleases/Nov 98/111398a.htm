    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 13 - </font><font face="Arial" size="2">More
    than two in five of all American households with children also have guns, and of those,
    about one in four keep those guns loaded and/or unlocked, according to a new study by
    Peter Hart Research on behalf of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.&nbsp; And,
    although most American parents realize that guns in the home endanger their children, they
    do not take active steps to protect them from accidental access.&nbsp; In the first
    national survey to query parents about their interactions with other parents about guns in
    the home, the research found a significant gap between what parents know about the dangers
    of guns, and the actions they take to ensure that their children will be safe in the homes
    of others. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the survey of 806 parents, 43% of
    households with children have guns, and 23% of gun households keep a gun loaded.&nbsp; 28%
    keep a gun hidden and unlocked.&nbsp; 54% of parents said they would be highly concerned
    about their child&#146;s safety if they knew there was a gun in the home of their child&#146;s
    friend.&nbsp; Most understand the dangers of guns: 71% knew that at least one out of three
    households has a gun, and 59% that one-third of gun-owning parents keep their gun loaded
    and accessible at least some of the time.&nbsp; But the vast majority also don&#146;t see
    the risk to their own child:&nbsp; 73% believe that it is &quot;not at all likely&quot;
    that their child would find and handle a gun without permission. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those seemingly contradictory beliefs translate into a
    &quot;disconnect&quot; between talk and action.&nbsp; Although 75% of parents &#150; and
    88% of gunowning parents &#150; say they have discussed with their children what to do if
    they find a gun in the home of a friend or neighbor, only 30% have asked the parents of
    their childrens&#146; friends if there is a gun in the home before allowing a visit.
    &nbsp; 61% of the parents responding haven&#146;t even thought about asking other parents
    about gun accessibility, for various reasons, including the assumption of safe storage
    (23%) or because it just never occurred to them to ask (25%). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Clearly, too many parents are just not thinking about
    the tragic possibilities of an innocent visit to another home,&quot; said Robert Walker,
    President of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.&nbsp; &quot;We know that parents are
    asking each other about supervision, food allergies, and TV habits, yet they are ignoring
    guns -- the one factor that could mean the life or death of their child.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although most parents are not asking each other about gun
    accessibility, it is not because the question is awkward or difficult.&nbsp; 41% of
    parents think it is always appropriate to ask about guns in the home, another 25% think it&#146;s
    appropriate to ask if they do not know the other parents well, and only 10% feel it is
    never appropriate to ask about guns in the home.&nbsp; Gunowners and non-gunowners feel
    similarly about this issue, meaning that the vast majority of gunowners do not find
    questions about their gun storage to be offensive or inappropriate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence plans a major,
    national public education campaign to convince parents to be sensitive to gun storage
    issues and to encourage them to talk to each other to minimize the risk their children
    will be injured or killed by guns.&nbsp; With this in mind, parents were queried about
    which facts would best catalyze these conversations.&nbsp; 28% believed the most important
    message is that &quot;55% of all accidental shootings are committed by a child or
    teenager,&quot; 20% that &quot;Guns kept in the home kill family members more often than
    they kill in self-defense,&quot; and 18% that &quot;Half of all handguns in the home are
    loaded, not locked, or both.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The poll was released at a Washington, D.C. Symposium on
    Guns and Children as a Public Health Issue, which featured Chicago Mayor Richard Daley,
    Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans, Southern Christian Leadership Conference leader
    Martin Luther King, III, gun injury researcher Dr. Arthur Kellermann of Emory University,
    Dr. Katherine Kaufer Christoffel of the HELP Network, and Andrés Soto of the Pacific
    Center for Violence Prevention, as well as Peter Hart. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We at the Center don&#146;t want to keep
    reading about four-year-olds shooting each other by accident, or teenagers killing each
    other with their parents&#146; accessible guns,&quot; Walker said.&nbsp; &quot;Only when
    parents are as conscientious about guns in the home as they are about lesser dangers can
    we protect our children from these terrible, and unnecessary, tragedies.&quot;</font></p>
