    <td align="left" valign="top" width="455" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 5 - Voters nationwide issued a strong rebuke
    to conservative candidates and the &quot;Gingrich Revolution.&quot;&nbsp; For the first
    time since before the Civil War, the Republicans failed to gain seats from the party of a
    president in the sixth year of his term.&nbsp; An energized core of progressive voters
    were key to Democratic gains in the House and in statehouses from California to Alabama.
    &nbsp; Strong turnout by union members, African American voters, Hispanic voters, and
    women, all key constituencies of the Democratic base, powered candidates to unexpected
    wins from North Carolina to New York, from California to Wisconsin.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This was an incumbents' election, but not a status-quo election.&nbsp; It marks the
    end of the conservative resurgence.&nbsp; People just aren't buying what Gingrich is
    peddling, and money and mud wasn't enough.&quot; said Robert L. Borosage of the Campaign
    for America's Future speaking today at the National Press Club.&nbsp; Mr. Borosage was
    joined by Celinda Lake, Ellen Miller, Guy Molyneux, and Ruy Teixeira in analyzing the
    results of the 1998 election from a progressive perspective.&nbsp; Not only is the
    conservative agenda unattractive, but their political strategy has reached its limit.
    &nbsp; &quot;The politics of division doesn't add up,&quot; said Borosage.
    &quot;Republicans are paying an ever higher cost for being the party of white, male
    sanctuary. &quot;<br>
    <br>
    For Democrats, the lessons are clear.&nbsp; The politics of inclusion works - and
    Democrats can coalesce around bread and butter economic issues of concern to working
    Americans.&nbsp; E2S2 - education, economy, Social Security - was the Democratic mantra
    that fueled a strong turnout in key states by union voters and African-American voters was
    central to the success of Democratic candidates.&nbsp; Some early estimates show that
    union voters this year made up 23 percent of voters, compared to 14 percent in 1994.
    &nbsp; Similarly, African-American voters increased from 9 percent to 11 percent and
    Hispanic voters jumped from 3 to 5 percent in this year's election.<br>
    <br>
    While enjoying the conservative collapse, Democrats cannot stand pat on the status quo.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; To regain majority status, said Ruy Teixeira, director of politics and public
    opinion at the Economic Policy Institute, Democrats have to reach out to low and moderate
    income voters.&nbsp; To do so, they will have to put forth a bolder agenda that addresses
    the real problems faced by working families.<br>
    <br>
    Second, Democrats must &quot;dance with those who brought them to the party&quot;, said
    Borosage.&nbsp; Across the country, voters supported candidates who promised to save
    Social Security.&nbsp;&nbsp; House Speaker Newt Gingrich revealed just how tone deaf he
    is, by concluding &quot;the number one lesson to learn is we ought to come back to
    Washington in January with a proposal to save Social Security by using the surplus to
    create private savings accounts.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Voters do not think that turning Social Security over to Wall Street, cutting
    guaranteed benefits and raising the retirement age to pay for private accounts is
    &quot;saving Social Security,&quot; warned Borosage, &quot;Democrats should stand firm
    against attempts to privatize Social Security. To compromise on this would be a staggering
    breach of faith to the very voters that have revived the party's fortunes and hold the key
    to its future.&quot;<br>
    <br>
