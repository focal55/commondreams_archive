    <td align="left" valign="top" width="455" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 5 - Maryland motorists are dodging more
    potholes these days but Maryland transportation agencies have spent the available,
    flexible federal aid to expand highways rather than fixing roads according to Potholes and
    Politics 1998, a report released today by the Surface Transportation Policy Project (STPP)
    and environmental and housing groups. Maryland has over 1,750 miles of urbanized area
    highways in poor or mediocre condition, yet spent an annual average of only $20,782 per
    urban highway mile in need of repair in 1996-97, compared to a national average of over
    $90,000. Maryland ranks second worst among states in the report's national &quot;Pothole
    Index,&quot; with only Arkansas lower in urbanized area road maintenance spending per
    highway mile in need of repair. The report finds that poor highway maintenance costs
    Marylanders $166 million annually for added car repairs, the equivalent of a $711 per car
    hidden tax. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of the $237 million in flexible federal
    funds spent on highways by Maryland in 1996-97, only $73 million, or 31%, went to road
    maintenance, while $164 million, or 69%, was spent on new construction. &quot;Instead of
    fixing existing roads in need of repair, the State Highway Administration puts too many
    dollars into new and wider roads. They're moving forward to spend $200 million to enlarge
    two-lane MD 32 through Western Howard County's farms into a massive new freeway,&quot;
    said Cheryl Cort, a planner with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. &quot;These new roads too
    often fuel sprawl, boost driving, and hurt the Chesapeake Bay with increased runoff and
    air pollution.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Baltimore Long Range Transportation Plan proposed
    for adoption this month would devote another $3 billion to highway expansion but leave the
    region's citizens with worse transportation choices, more congestion, and even more
    potholes,&quot; said Michael Replogle, federal transportation director at the
    Environmental Defense Fund. &quot;Widening roads won't solve these problems and undermines
    smart growth. The state should invest in strategies that renew older communities and
    reduce traffic growth.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Maryland got a 29% increase in Federal transportation
    funding in TEA-21, making $300 million a year available in 1999 for road repairs. The
    state must spend the dollars it has in hand to maintain existing roads before looking at
    increasing the gasoline tax to pay for new highways,&quot; said Al Barry, Chairman of the
    Committee on the Region of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report, Potholes and Politics 1998, was released today
    by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a Washington, DC based non-profit group, in
    partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, The Environmental Defense Fund, the
    Citizens Planning and Housing Association, the Baltimore Urban League, and 1000 Friends of
    Maryland. </font></p>
