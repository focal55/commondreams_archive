    November 1 - </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">A nationwide Pew Research Center survey
    finds voting intentions shifting significantly in favor of Democratic congressional
    candidates going into the final days of the 1998 midterm election campaign. For the first
    time this fall, the new survey shows likely voters equally divided between the two
    parties.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> In three previous surveys since late August,
    generic support for GOP candidates was consistently greater than that for Democrats. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img align="right" src="img.gif" WIDTH="269" HEIGHT="412"> The general increase in
    support for Democrats coincides with a similar increase in President Clinton's approval
    ratings, now at 65%. In the latest survey, likely voters are split between Democratic and
    Republican candidates 46%-44%, a significant change since mid-October when the GOP had a
    48%-43% edge. Conducted October 28-31, the new survey of 1,714 registered voters (743
    likely voters) began the same day that nationwide reports broke of a Republican
    advertising campaign drawing attention to the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The survey suggests that the judgment of undecided voters
    may be crucial to the outcome of many congressional races this year. Nearly one-in-five
    voters now only <em>lean </em>to a candidate or are flatly undecided, and the race is
    still even among likely voters who are committed to a choice at this time. The uncertainty
    of the election outcome is further underscored by two factors: <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>First, throughout the fall, the campaign has attracted
    less voter attention than it did in 1994, suggesting that voters may conclusively make up
    their minds later than they did four years ago or choose not to vote. </em><br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Secondly, the chances for reversal or acceleration of a
    trend is greatest when a shift occurs late in a campaign, as it apparently has this year.</em>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Democrats have made gains since mid-October among many
    voter groups, but the change in their favor is most evident among non-whites, older voters
    and those on the East and West coasts. Voter interest is higher on both coasts than it was
    in mid-October. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As in previous Pew surveys this fall, voter turnout seems
    likely to be lower than four years ago. However, the survey indicates that compared to
    1994, participation will be <em>relatively</em> greater among core Republicans and
    Democrats and lower among independent voters. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The percentage of people saying their vote for Congress
    will be a vote against Clinton slipped slightly to 17% from 23% in mid-October. At the
    same time, the percentage of voters with an unfavorable view of members who voted for
    congressional impeachment inquiry rose slightly to 54% from 49%. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the President's job approval rating has climbed, so has
    disapproval of GOP congressional leaders. Both of these factors are closely tied to
    generic support for congressional candidates of the respective parties. The survey finds
    increased support for reelection of incumbents compared to mid-October, but the view that
    most members deserve reelection remains significantly below what it was earlier in the
    year. However, voters express more satisfaction with incumbents -- both their own and
    generally -- than they did four years ago. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img align="right" src="img1.gif" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="240"> Education is the top
    issue for voters this year: 88% rank it as very important to the nation. The debate over
    how to use the budget surplus and efforts to ease the global economic crisis follow, with
    76% ranking each as very important. Regulating health maintenance organizations is next at
    68%. Majorities in both parties rank each of these issues as very important. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the very bottom of the list is the investigation into
    the relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky: Just 18% of registered
    voters say the issue is very important. The congressional debate over impeachment is
    deemed more significant, with 35% saying it is very important to the nation. Supporters of
    Republican candidates are far more likely to say these issues are important than are
    either backers of Democrats or undecided voters. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">ENDNOTES</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="N_1_">1. </a>Likely voters are derived from series
    of eight questions that measure thought given to the election, past voting history and
    expressed intention to vote. An assumption that 35% of the voting age population would
    cast a ballot for member of Congress was made. <br wp="br1">
