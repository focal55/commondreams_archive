    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 19 - </font>At protests in front of ARCO and Exxon
    offices, environmental activists announced the filing of shareholder resolutions
    concerning the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&nbsp; The resolutions ask ARCO and Exxon
    to &#147;unconditionally cancel any future plans for oil drilling in Coastal Plain, 1002
    area, of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and immediately stop the expenditure of any
    corporate funds targeted to achieve this objective.&#148;<br>
    <br>
    &#147;The Arctic Refuge is a national treasure of incalculable value,&#148; said Athan
    Manuel, director of the Public Interest Research Group&#146;s (PIRG) Save the Arctic<br>
    Wilderness campaign.&nbsp; &#147;We urge ARCO and Exxon to preserve the Refuge, not
    plunder it.&#148;<br>
    <br>
    ARCO is the second-largest oil producer and the largest U.S.-based oil producer in America&#146;s
    Arctic.&nbsp; Exxon is the third-largest producer in the Arctic and the largest oil
    company in the world.&nbsp; ARCO and Exxon are two of the three principal owners of the
    Trans Alaska Pipeline System, controlling approximately 20 percent each.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    oil industry already has access to 95 per cent of America&#146;s Arctic.<br>
    <br>
    The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last pristine areas left in the United
    States.&nbsp; Caribou, muskoxen, wolves, polar, brown and black bears, and hundreds of
    thousands of migratory birds rely on the wilderness habitat that the Refuge provides.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The Gwich&#146;in, which means &#147;people of the caribou,&#148; have lived in and around
    the Refuge for thousands of years.&nbsp; Their subsistence culture depends on the caribou
    herd.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;It is time to move support for preserving the Arctic from the streets into the
    boardroom,&#148; said Tracy Graham of Green Century Capital Management.&nbsp; &#147;We
    urge other ARCO shareholders to demonstrate a serious commitment to environmental
    stewardship by supporting the Arctic Refuge resolution.&#148;<br>
    <br>
    Protesters in front of&nbsp; ARCO&#146;s Los Angeles headquarters, Exxon&#146;s New Jersey
    office, and at a news conference in front of an Exxon service station in Washington, D.C.,
    called on shareholders to support the resolution, and urged the companies to endorse the
    Mo Udall Arctic Wilderness bill, HR 900 and S. 531.&nbsp; The bill would permanently
    protect the Arctic Refuge by designating the coastal plain as a wilderness area.<br>
    <br>
    &#147;As the tenth anniversary of the Valdez oil spill approaches, Exxon has the
    opportunity to make amends to the people and environment of&nbsp; Alaska,&#148; stated
    Simon Billenness, senior analyst at Franklin Research and Development.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to U.S. PIRG, Green Century Capital Management, and Franklin Research and
    Development, the Alaska Wilderness League, Sierra Club, Brian McWilliams, president of the
    International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union*, Greenpeace,&nbsp; Gwich&#146;in Steering
    Committee, The Wilderness Society, Trustees for Alaska, Rainforest Action Network,
    Northern Alaska Environmental Center, and the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union are
    supporting the shareholder resolutions.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The Green Century Equity Fund, on behalf of the Domini Social Index Portfolio**, filed the
    resolution with ARCO.&nbsp; Franklin Research and Development filed the resolution with
    Exxon. The state PIRGs&#146; national lobbying office, U.S. PIRG, is coordinating a
    national campaign to protect the Arctic Refuge from drilling.<br>
    <br>
    PIRG also announced that it has posted a 5-minute video on their web site, </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.pirg.org/enviro/arctic/index.htm">http://www.pirg.org/enviro/arctic/index.htm</a>.
    &nbsp; The video tells the story of the campaign to protect America&#146;s Arctic from oil
    drilling and development.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was developed thanks to a grant from the Lear
    Foundation.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">* * * </font></p>
