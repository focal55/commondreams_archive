    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 24 - </font>Public Citizen said today that a
    Canadian company's claim for damages against the U.S. government, filed under the North
    American Free Trade Agreement, undermines our democracy and jeopardizes the U.S. justice
    system.<br>
    <br>
    The Loewen Group, which owns more than 700 funeral homes and 109 cemeteries in the United
    States, filed the claim under an obscure but powerful NAFTA provision allowing
    corporations to directly sue governments for compensation over government actions that
    interfere with new investor rights guaranteed under NAFTA. It is the first such claim
    filed against the U.S. government under NAFTA's Chapter 11 &quot;investor-to-state&quot;
    provisions.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Loewen's challenge shows how global corporate predators, whether U.S., Canadian or
    Mexican, can use NAFTA as a giant loophole to evade the rule of law and our system of
    jurisprudence,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;This case is yet
    another reason why NAFTA should be regulated, not expanded to other countries in this
    hemisphere, as the administration proposes. We cannot stand by and allow NAFTA to be used
    as the broom for a sore loser to sweep justice aside.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In 1995, a Mississippi civil jury found the Loewen Group liable for committing unlawful
    anti-competitive and predatory acts in its quest to dominate local funeral markets. The
    case drew national attention to funeral industry fraud and excess. A Mississippi jury
    awarded $100 million in compensatory damages and $400 million in punitive damages to
    plaintiff Jeremiah O'Keefe, a Biloxi businessman. Loewen ultimately settled the case for
    $150 million rather than file an appeal to a higher court.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Americans have learned the hard way that NAFTA means unsafe food and job loss, but
    it's shocking to see the entire U.S. court system get attacked by NAFTA,&quot; said Lori
    Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. &quot;This case is the most
    vivid example that NAFTA threatens a wide swath of our basic laws and citizen safeguards
    that have nothing to do with trade.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Loewen's claim that its investor rights under NAFTA were violated constitutes a direct
    assault on the very workings of the civil justice system in Mississippi.&nbsp; NAFTA gives
    the company an avenue of appeal not <br>
    available to domestic corporations, which must live under the rule of law laid down by the
    state and federal court system. Under NAFTA's anti-democratic provisions, Loewen's claim
    will be heard by an international tribunal, where proceedings are conducted in secret and
    the records are not publicly accessible. Since the tribunal's decision will be final and
    binding, the U.S. government has no recourse to appeal outside of&nbsp; the tribunal's own
    limited appellate process. No one else can participate as amicus or intervenor or even
    hear the arguments presented.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This shows how NAFTA gives privileges to corporations and not citizens, and often at
    the expense of citizens,&quot; Claybrook said.<br>
    <br>
    If successful, U.S. taxpayers could be forced to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars
    to a Canadian company found by a judge and jury to have committed malicious and fraudulent
    business practices.&nbsp; The case also could set a precedent that would embolden any
    number of other North American corporations to use NAFTA to challenge laws, policies or
    jury verdicts they find objectionable.&nbsp; NAFTA has already been used by U.S.-based
    corporations seeking to challenge Canadian and Mexican environmental laws that cost them
    money.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If we allow Loewen to use NAFTA to escape justice today, we surrender justice
    tomorrow and forever,&quot; Claybrook said.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">###</font></p>
