    <td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="465"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">WASHINGTON - November 24 - </font>The following was released today by the
    United Food and Commercial Workers International Union:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) will face a new test of its recently unveiled
    &quot;Neighborhood Market&quot; format when more than a thousand workers, religious
    leaders and community activists descend on Bentonville, Ark., to tell the retail giant,
    &quot;Not in My Neighborhood.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The company recently opened four traditional supermarkets,
    operating under the name &quot;Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market&quot; in Arkansas as a test of
    the company's intended takeover of the supermarket business.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wal-Mart has, until now, limited its grocery sales to
    &quot;Supercenters&quot; that combine a retail food operation with a general merchandise
    store. Wal-Mart has announced its plan to double its retail food sales over the next five
    years, and already has the distribution network in place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wal-Mart's takeover move is a direct threat to the jobs,
    wages and health benefits of supermarket employees, and will bring one of the largest
    demonstrations to Wal-Mart's headquarters in the history of the company.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In contrast to Wal-Mart, most major supermarket chains
    provide employer-paid health benefits, pension plans and living wages for workers. At
    Wal-Mart, six out of 10 workers are not covered under the company health plan, and, for
    those who are, the average cost is about $1,200 a year. Wal-Mart wages are, on average,
    about $3 an hour less than major supermarket chains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wal-Mart won't, as is often claimed, create any new jobs,
    but rather will destroy current supermarket jobs along with the decent wages and health
    benefits that come with those jobs. A new entry into the supermarket business does not
    generate any additional demand for groceries, a company can only take business and jobs
    from existing retail food operators.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Wal-Mart would take jobs that have health benefits
    and turn them into jobs that don't. The workers and their families lose their health care,
    the community loses as more of its limited resources go to a growing number of families
    that have to rely on publicly-funded health services, and other companies lose as they
    have to pay higher costs to insure their own workers. When Wal-Mart wins, everybody else
    loses,&quot; said UFCW President Douglas H. Dority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Dec. 2 &quot;Not in My Neighborhood&quot; march will
    kick off at2 p.m. at Wal-Mart headquarters and will be followed by a rally in the
    Bentonville, Ark., town square.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">John Sweeney, president of the 13.5 million member AFL-CIO,
    and UFCW President Dority will lead the demonstration of rank-and-file workers from across
    the country. Workers will assemble in three cities designated as staging areas for a bus
    caravan to Bentonville.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pre-march rallies will be held on Dec. 1 in the designated
    cities. Sweeney and Dority will address each of the rallies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The pre-march rallies will be held at:</font></p>
