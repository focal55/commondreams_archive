          TX - April 15 - A new study released today by Public Citizen shows that 
          the ratepayers of five Texas electric utilities are paying too much 
          for their electricity. Making matters worse, at the behest of the incumbent 
          electric utilities, ratepayers will be mandated by the legislature to 
          bail out the bad investments or so-called, stranded costs, of the electric 
          utilities.<br>
          <br>
          Action must be taken now, as the laws governing the electric utility 
          industry are rewritten, to provide protections for consumers. Unless 
          these protections are included in the deregulation bills currently being 
          debated in the legislature, the holding companies will use their vast 
          empires to pick the pockets of consumers for other utility services, 
          such as gas, telecommunications and Internet access. They will also 
          use their network of affiliates and their ability to cross-subsidize 
          these subsidiaries to chill competition. Unless carefully restructured, 
          with prohibitions against affiliate abuses, we will be left with unregulated 
          monopolies for all of our important utility services.<br>
          <br>
          "Utility holding companies are notorious for ripping off ratepayers, 
          hence the nickname "combines." Just like farmers using their combines 
          to harvest West Texas wheat, utility holding companies are corporate 
          combines harvesting money from ratepayers," said Tom Smith, State Director 
          of Public Citizen’s Texas office.<br>
          <br>
          The report, Money Harvest: The Utility Holding Companies of Texas Are 
          Ripping Off Ratepayers, demonstrates how holding companies are reaping 
          extra profits for electricity services and using the excess profits 
          for purchasing foreign companies. Three utility holding companies in 
          Texas have been using ratepayer money to acquire additional companies 
          located throughout the world. Central and South West has recently acquired 
          companies in Brazil, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Reliant Energy 
          has recently acquired companies in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, 
          India, and Mexico, and has acquired a portion of a company headquartered 
          in the Netherlands. Texas Utilities has recently acquired companies 
          in Australia, China, Chile, Finland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, and the 
          United Kingdom.<br>
          <br>
          Smith charged, "When Texas Utilities Co. agreed to pay $10.4 billion 
          for Britain’s Energy Group PLC, it was one of the largest foreign acquisitions 
          ever. These are the same guys coming hat-in-hand to the Legislature 
          saying they need a ratepayer-funded bail-out to remain competitive."<br>
          <br>
          The Texas Legislature may force ratepayers to hand over an estimated 
          $4.6 billion to the subsidiaries of the three utility holding companies 
          in the form of a stranded cost bailout for bad investments in power 
          plants. Central Power & Light could receive a stranded cost bailout 
          of $1.6 billion, or $2,550 per customer. Houston Lighting & Power could 
          receive $1.5 billion, or $960 per customer. Texas Utilities Electric 
          Company could receive $1.5 billion, or $620 per customer. Some of this 
          money will then flow to the three utility holding companies, which can 
          use it to further expand their empires.<br>
          <br>
          "Ratepayer robbery was a common sport among the utility holding companies 
          of the Roaring Twenties. This report shows that the utility holding 
          companies of Texas are back to their old tricks," said Wenonah Hauter, 
          Director of Public Citizen’s Critical Mass Energy Project in Washington, 
          DC. "In addition, Texas ratepayers are being asked to pay billions of 
          dollars to bail out utility investment in plants that produce power 
          that is too expensive to sell," added Hauter.<br>
          <br>
          The report analyzes the electric bills paid by the ratepayers of these 
          five electric utilities since 1989. The report shows that, while ratepayers 
          have had to pay high electricity bills, $9.6 billion of ratepayer money 
          has been given to the three utility holding companies that own these 
          utilities. Central and South West Corporation, which owns Central Power 
          & Light Co. and West Texas Utilities Co., has received $1.7 billion 
          in profits. Reliant Energy, Inc., which owns Houston Lighting & Power 
          Co., has received $2.7 billion in profits. Texas Utilities Company, 
          which owns Southwestern Electric Service Co. and Texas Utilities Electric 
          Co., has received $5.2 billion in profits.<br>
          <br>
          According to the 68-page report, ratepayers of Central Power & Light 
          company are paying an extra $245 per year for electricity. Ratepayers 
          of West Texas Utilities Company are paying an extra $162 per year. Ratepayers 
          of Houston Lighting & Power Company are paying an extra $218 per year. 
          Ratepayers of Southwestern Electric Service Company are paying an extra 
          $72 per year, and ratepayers of Texas Utilities Electric Company are 
          paying an extra $239 per year. These profits should have been used to 
          pay down their bad investments in power plants.<br>
          <br>
          "By keeping electricity bills high, the utility holding companies have 
          been receiving ratepayer money to fuel the expansion of their empires," 
          said Charlie Higley, a Senior Energy Analyst in Public Citizen’s Washington 
          office and author of the report. "Because ratepayers have to buy electricity, 
          we’re being forced to pay the high rates while the utility holding companies 
          rake in higher profits."<br>
          <br>
          The report concludes that Texas ratepayers would pay lower electricity 
          bills if their electric utilities were not owned by holding companies. 
          The report recommends that Texas lawmakers should prohibit holding companies 
          from owning electric utilities. It also recommends that Texas lawmakers 
          should not force ratepayers to bail out the stranded costs of electric 
          utilities. The report recommends increased authority for the Public 
          Utility Commission in Texas for prohibiting affiliate abuses. <br>
