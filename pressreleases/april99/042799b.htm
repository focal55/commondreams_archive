- April 27 - Lawyers and law firms are the leading source of campaign cash so 
far for presidential candidates Al Gore, Bill Bradley, and George W. Bush, a computer 
analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics finds.<br>
<br>
Law firms also have proven to be big sources of "bundled" contributions, as law 
partners, their associates, and their immediate families have pooled checks to 
make big impressions on the candidates. Leading the pack was Vinson & Elkins, 
a Houston-based firm that delivered more than $172,000 to the Bush campaign, the 
analysis found.<br>
<br>
Detailed political contribution profiles for Gore, Bradley, and Bush – including 
the biggest sources of campaign money by industry and geography, as well as lists 
of top contributors and searchable databases – are available on the Center's website 
at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/home/index.asp">www.opensecrets.org</a>.<br>
<br>
The profiles are based on data filed by the candidates with the Federal Election 
Commission on April 15, and reflect fund-raising for the first three months of 
1999. Contributors were coded by the Center to identify the industry/interest 
of donors. Gore and Bradley, both Democrats, filed electronically with the FEC. 
Bush, a Republican, filed on paper, but made an electronic copy of his donors 
available on his website.<br>
<br>
None of the other presidential candidates provided electronic copies of their 
reports – even though all the campaigns routinely use computers to generate the 
reports they file on paper with the FEC and several candidates have publicly advocated 
mandatory electronic filing of campaign finance reports.<br>
<br>
The profiles show that Gore, Bradley, and Bush relied almost exclusively on individual, 
rather than political action committee (PAC) money. Bush accepted $115,700, or 
just 1.5 percent of total receipts, from PACs. Gore and Bradley are not accepting 
PAC money.<br>
<br>
But despite the $1,000 limit on individual donations, all the candidates collected 
large sums of "bundled" contributions from employees of the same organizations, 
particularly law firms and securities firms.<br>
<br>
The biggest so far was $172,400 to the Bush campaign by attorneys from the Houston-based 
law firm of Vinson & Elkins and their spouses. The Texas governor also collected 
large bundles from three other law firms – Texas-based Jenkens & Gilchrist ($92,400) 
and Haynes & Boone ($52,800), and Philadelphia-based Blank, Rome et al ($43,500).<br>
<br>
Vice President Gore's top donor was the accounting firm Ernst & Young, whose partners 
and their families delivered $67,950 in contributions. The company also topped 
the list of presidential donors in 1996, both to the Clinton-Gore campaign and 
to Republican nominee Bob Dole.<br>
<br>
The vice president also received $49,750 from donors affiliated with the National 
Jewish Democratic Council. He got a $47,500 bundle from individuals working for 
BellSouth Corp. and $45,500 from the Wall Street investment banking house of Goldman, 
Sachs & Co<br>
<br>
Top contributors to Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, were two Chicago 
law firms – Winston & Strawn ($37,500) and Mayer, Brown & Platt ($31,050) – as 
well as Wall Street's JP Morgan & Co ($36,250).|<br>
<br>
Employees or partners of the businesses and their immediate families – not the 
businesses themselves – made all the contributions. Under U.S. law, corporations 
and labor unions may not give directly to federal candidates.<br>
<br>
Overall, lawyers and law firms figured prominently in the contribution reports; 
they were the leading industry for all three candidates. Gore got the most from 
lawyers, with $1.4 million in contributions. Bush collected $747,000 and Bradley 
got $646,000.<br>
<br>
Here's the breakdown of the top five industries to each of the three candidates:<br>
<br>
<b>Al Gore<br>
</b> Lawyers/Law Firms $1,425,311<br>
Retired $486,761<br>
Securities & Investment $450,301<br>
Real Estate $340,100<br>
TV/Movies/Music $266,700<br>
<br>
<b>Bill Bradley<br>
</b> Lawyers/Law Firms $646,150<br>
Securities & Investment $552,800<br>
Retired $284,450<br>
Real Estate $154,300<br>
Business Services $115,250<br>
<br>
<b>George W. Bush<br>
</b> Lawyers/Law Firms $747,550<br>
Retired $501,800<br>
Real Estate $277,750<br>
Misc. Finance $223,850<br>
Oil & Gas $219,150<br>
<br>
Geographic analysis of contributions also produced some interesting contrasts 
among the candidates. Bush collected more than half his large contributions ($3.7 
million) from his home state of Texas. His top two metro areas were Dallas ($1.3 
million) and Houston ($789,000). Large contributions are defined as all donations 
of at least $200, which must be disclosed to the FEC. Smaller contributions do 
not have to be itemized.<br>
<br>
Al Gore's biggest states were New York ($1.4 million) and California ($1.0 million) 
– traditionally the two richest sources of campaign funds in the nation. His top 
three metro areas were Washington ($1.3 million), New York ($1.1 million), and 
Los Angeles ($584,000).<br>
<br>
Bill Bradley drew a quarter of his campaign dollars – just more than $1 million 
– from Chicago. That was enough to make Illinois his biggest state ($1.0 million), 
followed closely by New York ($920,000) and his home state of New Jersey ($810,000).<br>
<br>
The richest zip code for both Bradley and Gore was 10021 in Manhattan's upper 
East Side, which produced $240,700 for Gore and $167,500 for Bradley. Bush's top 
zip code was 75205 in Dallas, which produced $228,750 in large contributions.<br>
<br>
Detailed profiles of all three candidates can be found on the Center's website 
at www.opensecrets.org. Analysis of the other candidates will follow in the weeks 
ahead. Since they filed on paper, instead of electronically, their data will not 
be available on-line until the Federal Election Commission finishes keypunching 
the records into their computers.<br>
<br>
All the candidates listed large numbers of contributors without identifying their 
occupations or employers. Federal law requires the campaigns to make their "best 
effort" to supply the occupation and employer of all donors giving at least $200. 
In reality, the requirement is rarely enforced by the FEC.<br>
<br>
Among the three campaigns analyzed, Bush had the worst record in supplying full 
information on his donors. Some $1.8 million, or 26 percent of the money from 
his large donors, carried no occupation/employer information. Al Gore omitted 
occupation data for 18 percent of his major contributors, also amounting to $1.8 
million. Bill Bradley had the best disclosure rate; just six percent of his contributions 
($269,000) lacked employer data.<br>
<br>
Without information on the donor's occupation or employer, it is impossible to 
analyze the source of a contribution by industry/interest. In all, the Center 
was able to apply an industry/interest group classification to 72 percent of Bradley's 
large donors, 71 percent of Gore's, and 54 percent of Bush's.<br>
<br>
The Bush campaign originally provided only the occupations of its donors – not 
their employers – in the computer version of its disclosure. But the full data, 
including employers, was supplied by the campaign after it was requested.<br>
<br>
The Center will continue categorizing each candidate's throughout the election 
period and will post the results on its website. The full on-line profiles include 
summary data on the amount raised and spent by each candidate, an analysis of 
their contributions by sector and industry, a list of their top 20 donors, and 
a geographic breakdown of the top five states giving to their campaign, as well 
as the 10 leading metro areas and top 10 zip codes.<br>
