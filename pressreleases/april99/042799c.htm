WI - April 27 - In the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, people across 
the nation are searching for answers and asking what can be done to reduce youth 
violence. For some, it means planning "Safe Night" parties for youth.<br>
<br>
"These horrific episodes of youth homicide can and must call us to action as a 
country," said Deborah Prothrow-Stith, MD, a nationally recognized leader in the 
field of adolescent violence prevention and Professor at the Harvard School of 
Public Health.<br>
<br>
Dr. Prothrow-Stith and others across the country are carrying a message of hope 
for those who are concerned about their own communities and wondering what they 
can do to help prevent violence.<br>
<br>
"Violence is preventable, not inevitable," said Linda Lantieri of Resolving Conflict 
Creatively Program National Center, an initiative of Educators for Social Responsibility.<br>
<br>
To help curb youth violence, Lantieri and Educators for Social Responsibility 
have gotten involved in one national program that can have an impact. It’s called 
Safe Night USA – a national effort to address the issue of youth safety one night 
at a time. Safe Night USA is teaching and encouraging people across the country 
to hold "Safe Nights" for youth. A Safe Night is a party, planned by youth and 
adults, with time to learn how to deal with anger and confrontation appropriately.<br>
<br>
"We want people to know that there are things we can do in our communities to 
make a difference and schools have an important role to play," Lantieri added.<br>
<br>
"The idea is for youth to come to a party and have a good time. During the party, 
they learn useful skills for resolving conflict peacefully," explained Olu Sijuwade, 
the program’s founder. At a Safe Night party, three rules are enforced: no weapons, 
no alcohol or drugs, and no arguments. "We chose those three rules because weapons, 
alcohol or other drugs and arguments are the three most common factors that lead 
to acts of violence," he added.<br>
<br>
Sijuwade, who works for the Milwaukee Health Department, started Safe Nights in 
Milwaukee in 1994 as a tool to deal with the city’s rising youth homicide rate. 
Since that time, the program has been credited as a key factor in a 60% drop in 
Milwaukee’s youth homicide rate.<br>
<br>
Now, the Safe Night concept is spreading across the country. On June 5, cities 
and towns in every state and Puerto Rico will hold Safe Night events, all connected 
through a live show on PBS and BET. Safe Night USA Project Director Maria Alvarez 
Stroud is enthusiastic about the overwhelming interest she has seen.<br>
<br>
"From Alaska to Maine, communities of all sizes are joining the effort – some 
to prevent violence, others to intervene and stop a growing problem," she said. 
In Miami, for example, Safe Night planners expect 500 youth to attend a concert 
and beach party on June 5 with conflict resolution skill training in the middle. 
The same night, seven Safe Night parties will be held in Berkeley, California, 
with some focusing on violence prevention and others on conflict resolution. In 
Detroit, the goal is to have 150 Safe Night parties on June 5.<br>
<br>
Organizers say the concept can work well in rural areas, too. In Kentucky, for 
example, the goal is to have Safe Night events in all 122 counties, many of which 
are predominantly rural. In Paducah, which was stunned by a school shooting in 
1997, a Safe Night is being planned for June 5. "We are still grieving and our 
Safe Night event will help us in the healing process," said event organizer Nancy 
Snook.<br>
<br>
"It’s an excellent way for neighborhoods and communities, as well as our entire 
country, to come together on the same night to show support for our youth and 
their safety, and offer them skills for managing their emotions and resolving 
conflict nonviolently," Alvarez Stroud added.<br>
<br>
Lantieri concurs. Her organization, which specializes in teaching conflict resolution 
skills in schools, has joined a number of other national youth-oriented organizations 
in supporting the effort. In addition to Educators for Social Responsibility, 
partners include National 4-H Council and Boys & Girls Clubs of America, as well 
as The American Academy of Pediatrics and others.<br>
<br>
Alvarez Stroud tempered her enthusiasm with a note of caution about seeing Safe 
Night as a complete solution to issues of youth violence. "Safe Night appears 
to be an effective violence prevention strategy, but it’s not a cure-all. Safe 
Night alone is not going to make all problems go away. It has to be in conjunction 
with other prevention strategies and a commitment to work together on the local 
level."<br>
<br>
Dr. Prothrow-Stith agreed. "America clearly has a problem and not one of us is 
able to hide. It’s a problem that we can prevent," she said. "We must use the 
memory of all the murdered children and the pain and anger invoked by the current 
tragedy to invest in prevention. It is overdue."<br>
<br>
Joanne Cantor, a communications professor at the University of Wisconsin and author 
of the recent book Mommy, I’m Scared, noted the power of the media. "While we 
struggle for answers, this horrible event focuses our attention on the awesome 
power of the media for both good and ill," she noted. "We question the influence 
of the media as a contributing factor in this tragedy, while at the same time, 
the media have been instrumental in uniting us as a nation in our grief."<br>
<br>
On its own, Safe Night is a great idea, asserts Cantor. "What the live broadcast 
adds is the sense of national connectedness. What I especially like about the 
live show is that this is a case where the media can actually be used in a positive 
way, to help prevent violence."<br>
<br>
There is still time to join the national effort by planning a Safe Night event 
in conjunction with the national celebration on June 5. For a free planning guide

Wood Johnson Foundation.<br>
