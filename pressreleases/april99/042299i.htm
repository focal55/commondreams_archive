- April 22 - The Equal Rights Alliance (ERA) met today with Dr. Robert Gallagher, 
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Our representatives were informed that if 
the hunger strike ended, J.W. Connolly, Chairperson of the University of Pittsburgh 
Board of Trustees would meet with alone with two hunger strikers on Friday, April 
23 at 2:00 PM in room 159 of the Cathedral of Learning. The administration requested 
two specific student strikers by name. During the meeting with Gallagher, we requested 
to include additional hunger strikers, alternative hunger strikers or non-hunger 
strikers (e.g. a lawyer, media representative, faculty, staff, or community member). 
Dr. Gallagher was extremely doubtful that these simple requests would be allowed, 
but said he would ask Connolly. We also personally told Mr. Dunkelman, the Secretary 
of the Board of Trustees about our desire to meet with Connolly without restrictions. 
At the close of business on Thursday, we received no word on whether or not Connolly 
had considered our inquiries about a modified meeting, or a meeting without the 
condition of ending the hunger strike. We hope to resolve these issues Friday 
at 2 PM.<br>
<br>
The hunger strikers, who begain striking on Monday, April 12th, were pleased to 
hear from Connolly and we will not pass up the opportunity to keep the lines of 
communication open. We will make every attempt to meet with Connolly on Friday, 
but we will not end the hunger strike in order to do so. Despite experiencing 
symptoms such as headaches, extreme lethargy, dizziness and irritability, the 
strikers wish to reiterate that they will not eat until the board agrees to an 
open forum. By not addressing our request for a public forum, the Board has demonstrated 
that they do not wish to be held publicly accountable for their decisions, which 
affect the entire University, the City of Pittsburgh, and local ordinances across 
Pennsylvania. Speaking alone and in private excludes other members of the Board, 
the media and the community. These actions are in opposition to the founding principle 
of this nation-democratic accountability. It is not unreasonable to expect that 
when the faculty, students, staff, community and City government have universally 
condemned Pitt's actions, the Board ought to at the very least explain its decision. 
So the question is not as Pitt spokesperson, Ken Service, put it "Should the Board 
of Trustees grant a meeting every time students decide to have a hunger strike?" 
but rather, what kind of system does the University of Pittsburgh have that forces 
students to go on hunger strike for 12 days in an attempt to talk with the people 
who have made decisions that go against the wishes of the faculty, staff, undergraduates, 
graduate students, community and City government?<br>
<br>
According to Ken Service, all avenues for getting a meeting with the Trustees 
have been tried. Arranging the open forum is a simple matter. It can be called 
by J.W. Connolly (Chairperson of the Board), Chancellor Nordenberg, or at the 
written request of five members of the Board. Members of the Equal Rights Alliance 
were even visibly present at the February 18th meeting of the Board and the issue 
could have easily been added to the agenda by any one of the members; they chose 
to adjourn instead. Dr. Gallagher said he didn't think Chancellor Nordenberg "ever 
even entertained the possibility" of using his authority to set up the public 
forum.<br>
<br>
J.W. Connolly already knows how we feel and we know how he feels about this issue-he 
is the only trustee who has publicly spoken about it (See the interview in the 
March 4, 1999 issue of the University Times, which available at <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/utimes/issues/990304/13.html">http://www.pitt.edu/utimes/issues/990304/13.html</a>.) 
When the University Times asked on March 4, 1999, "How do you feel when you hear 
people making accusations that you're homophobic, that the board is homophobic?" 
J.W. Connolly responded, "Are you asking me if I like girls? Is that what your 
question is?" We are hunger striking in order to gain an open, public forum with 
the board of trustees so that each individual member can be held accountable for 
their actions.<br>
<br>
The University has repeatedly stated that domestic partner benefits need to be 
mandated at the state level and that Pittsburgh cannot equate domestic partners 
with spouses. We do not dispute the fact that Pennsylvania should act; however 
the University of Pittsburgh itself is directly discriminating against gays in 
two ways. First, Pitt recognizes and accepts domestic partners-they even offer 
them limited benefits. They specifically chose, however, not to extend medical 
benefits, despite the fact that married couples receive them. Second, Pitt chose 
the criterion of marriage, knowing full well that is was a standard gays couldn't 
legally meet. Pittsburgh's Human Relations Commission determined that because 
of this, Pitt discriminates against its gay employees. An analogous situation 
would be if the police decided to hire only people over six feet tall. While there 
is no law against height discrimination, such a requirement has a disparate impact 
on women and is therefore discriminatory.<br>
