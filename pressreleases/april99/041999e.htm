- April 19 - A new analysis conducted by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 
(NCRC) reveals that Sen. Shelby's (R-Ala.) amendment to a financial modernization 
bill being considered by the Senate would exempt 72 percent of all rural, small 
banks from the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).<br>
<br>
More than 3,870 non-metropolitan banks under $100 million in assets would no longer 
be obliged to reinvest in their communities by making loans and investments to 
small business, farmers, working-class, and minority borrowers. "Small banks have 
not earned an exemption from CRA since they do not behave like the community-centered 
banks making lots and lots of loans that Sen. Shelby would like us to believe," 
asserts John Taylor, president and CEO of NCRC.<br>
<br>
A NCRC tabulation of the CRA ratings from 1990 through 1998 shows that all small 
banks (rural and urban) fail CRA exams out of proportion to their numbers. While 
small banks comprise 60 percent of all banks, they have received 90 percent of 
the worst CRA ratings, substantial non-compliance since 1990 (26 out of 29 substantial 
non-compliance ratings according to the FFIEC web page). Likewise, small banks 
gathered 71 percent of the needs-to-improve ratings (211 out of 197 ratings) in 
that time period.<br>
<br>
Small banks received Satisfactory ratings in proportion to their numbers, but 
did not earn Outstanding ratings in proportion to their numbers. Small banks earned 
66 percent of all Satisfactory ratings and 55 percent of all Outstanding ratings 
from 1990 to 1998.<br>
<br>
"If small, rural banks are exempt from CRA, small farmers will experience a deep 
drop in access to loans," exclaims NCRC Board member Shelly Sheehy of the Muscatine 
Center for Strategic Action in Iowa. "I bet if you conducted an experiment in 
which CRA was removed and put back in place a few years later, an even greater 
percentage of small banks would fail their CRA exams. It is unconscionable to 
remove CRA for small, rural banks -- they are 85 percent of the non-metro lenders 
in my state," Sheehy continues.<br>
<br>
NCRC reviewed the impact of the exemption in Senator Shelby's home state ofAlabama, 
and found that 71 percent of all non-metropolitan banks would be exempt. NCRC 
also found that small rural banks have spotty community reinvestment records. 
In a sample of all FDIC exams (available over the Internet) of rural Alabama banks 
in 1998, NCRC found that banks with Satisfactory ratings only had loan-to-deposit 
ratios of 47 percent in contrast to banks with Outstanding ratings that had loan-to-deposit 
ratios of 71 percent. This means that the majority of banks in Alabama that have 
undergone CRA exams in the last few years loan less than half of what they receive 
in deposits.<br>
<br>
One "Satisfactory" bank, Escambia County Bank, had an abysmal loan-to-deposit 
ratio of only 22 percent. In contrast, First State Bank of Dekalb had a loan-to-deposit 
ratio of 85 percent although it had $12 million less in assets.<br>
<br>
CRA exams revealed the reasons behind the differences in performance. For example, 
First State met credit needs in several ways including participation in the development 
of affordable housing for elderly and disabled individuals, sponsorship of the 
"Banking Is" financial literacy program at local high schools, and the establishment 
of electronic credit accounts for small and medium-sized businesses. In contrast, 
Escambia County Bank, the lender with the dismal loan-to-deposit ratio, has not 
established partnerships with local public agencies or developers of affordable 
housing, does not participate in government-guaranteed loan programs, and "typically 
requires 20 percent equity in the property (home), which precludes some low-income 
families from borrowing," according to the CRA exam. This lender and others similarly 
situated in Alabama and across the country would be exempt from CRA under Senator 
Shelby's amendment.<br>
<br>
NCRC Board Member Hubert Van Tol of the Wisconsin Rural Development Center states, 
"CRA exams provide important insights to community residents as to how well banks 
serve their community. While one bank is engaging in several innovative marketing 
and product strategies, another one down the street may still be requiring 20 
percent downpayments despite the demonstrated success of low-downpayment programs. 
Free market economists and policy-makers should love CRA exams; they reveal to 
consumers, borrowers, and depositors which banks offer the best products and the 
best prices."<br>
<br>
On average, the small bank CRA exams reviewed by NCRC were 8 pages long. This 
is hardly the stuff of regulatory burden and paperwork as maintained by the opponents 
of CRA.<br>
<br>
"We have been doing our best to educate Sens. Shelby and Gramm," states Taylor. 
"We have given their respective staff everything they have asked for because we 
hope to demonstrate the tremendous benefits of CRA to them. The small bank exemption 
and the safe harbor provision in the financial modernization bill authored by 
Sen. Gramm would be the death knell for CRA."<br>
<br>
The safe harbor provision in Sen. Gramm's bill would require federal banking regulators 
to consider comments on CRA aspects of a bank merger application only if the person 
commenting can prove that banks that have passed their CRA exams should no longer 
receive at least a Satisfactory rating. This would effectively end public comments 
in many cases since citizens would have to prove that multi-state banks fail their 
CRA exams in each and every state. Legitimate public concerns about local branch 
closing or changes to loan programs would be dismissed.<br>
<br>
"Sen. Gramm feels that during the merger application process, banks pay groups 
off to say nice things about the banks. The Senator has not yet offered one example 
of this, while community organizations can point to the billions of dollars that 
have flowed to neighborhoods as a result of CRA. Let's not kill the most effective 
tool to revitalize neighborhoods over a phantom problem," concludes Taylor. <br>
<br>
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) is the nation's CRA trade 
association of more than 700 community reinvestment organizations dedicated to 
revitalizing inner city neighborhoods and rural areas by promoting partnerships 
between lenders and community leaders.<br>
