- April 26 - The following was released today by Handgun Control Inc.:<br>
<br>
Six days after the Littleton shooting, Americans are asking how juniors in high 
school could amass the firepower to commit the massacre.<br>
<br>
Attached is a factsheet from Handgun Control listing the "seven deadly loopholes" 
that enable juveniles to have easy accss to firearms. Federal legislation addressing 
these loopholes is expected to be introduced -- or reintroduced -- very shortly.<br>
<br>
<b>The Seven Deadly Loopholes that Give Children Easy Access to Firearms<br>
</b> <br>
In the school shootings of the 1997-98 school year, and in the incidents that 
occur every week in which a child brings a gun to school, the child usually gets 
the gun from home.<br>
<br>
On April 24, federal investigators announced that the firearms used in the Columbine 
High School massacre were most likely obtained legally by the shooters in private, 
unregulated sales. Determining who sold them the guns and whether or not those 
sales were indeed legal may be extremely difficult because it is unlikely that 
a "paper trail" exists for investigators to follow.<br>
<br>
Whether a gun is brought to school from home or purchased legally from a private 
seller, these cases illustrate the gaping loopholes in our current firearms laws 
which enable minors -- and criminals -- to get firearms. These loopholes exist, 
in large part, thanks to the gun lobby which continues to resist any attempt to 
close them.<br>
<br>
1. Parents are not required to keep loaded firearms out of the reach of children. 
Only 16 states presently have Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws which hold gun 
owners criminally responsible if a child gains access to an unsecured firearm 
and uses it to injure themselves or someone else. CAP laws not only protect children 
against the criminal use of a gun by a child but also protect against unintentional 
shootings by children.<br>
<br>
2. So-called "private collectors" can sell guns without background checks at gun 
shows and flea markets. The Brady law requires that federally licensed gun dealers 
initiate and complete a background check before they sell a firearm, whether the 
sale takes place at a gun store or at a gun show. No such requirement extends 
to individuals who call themselves "private collectors" at gun shows and other 
public venues. In most states, these individuals are legally able to sell one, 
five, 10 or 20 guns at gun shows without conducting a background check or following 
any of the state's firearms sales laws. Recent studies have shown that gun shows 
have become a significant source of guns for illegal users, including children.<br>
<br>
3. Private gun owners do not have to keep records with respect to whom they sell 
their guns. Federal law requires that gun stores keep record on guns that are 
sold so that police can trace firearms recovered in crime. Private citizens, however, 
are not required to inform the police or keep any records when they resell a gun. 
As a result, law enforcement's ability to trace how a gun got into a youth's -- 
or a criminal's -- hands is severely hampered. Furthermore, this loophole facilitates 
the flow of guns into the illegal market via "straw purchasers." Straw purchasers 
are individuals who are legally able to buy guns and who buy guns for resale to 
illegal buyers. Straw purchasers are able to guy guns in large quantities from 
gun stores and then resell them on the street to illegal buyers with little fear 
of being caught. Only about a dozen states have laws requiring that private sales 
of firearms be recorded and only three states limit the number of handguns that 
can be purchased at any one time.<br>
<br>
4. Gun manufacturers and stores are not required to lock up their guns when the 
factory or store is closed. There are no security standards for gun stores. Some 
guns stores lock up their guns in a vault when the store is closed, but the vast 
majority do not. As a result, thousands of guns are stolen from stores every year. 
In 1998, California passed tough new security standards for gun manufacturers 
and distributors aimed at blocking thefts, but no such standards exist in other 
states.<br>
<br>
5. Gun manufacturers are not required to make guns that are safer and less accessible 
to children an other unauthorized users. Manufacturers have the ability, using 
existing technology, to make guns that cannot be used by unauthorized users. Simple 
internal locking devices, including combination locks, have been available for 
years, but manufacturers have not taken advantage of even these simple, inexpensive 
devices. They have not even taken steps to make their products safer by including 
simple features on all guns, such as load indicators which tell the user that 
the gun is still loaded. guns are not regulated for safety by the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission of any other federal agency, making it the only unregulated 
consumer product in America today. As a result, many guns manufactured today lack 
even the most basic kind of safety devices.<br>
<br>
6. In most states, juveniles of any age can purchase of be in possession of assault 
weapons. Although juveniles 18 and younger are prohibited by Federal law from 
purchasing handguns, neither the Federal government nor most states restrict the 
purchase and ownership of long guns. Although this loophole allows teenagers to 
hunt with rifles and shotguns, it also allows them to possess semi-automatic Uzis, 
AK-47s, AR-15s and other assault weapons manufactured before 1994 and "grandfathered" 
under that year's assault weapon ban. One gun used in the Colorado massacre was 
apparently a TEC-9, an infamous assault pistol that was also used in the 1993 
massacre at a San Francisco law firm in which eight people died and six were wounded.<br>
<br>
7. Young adults aged 18-21 can legally purchase handguns. Under federal law, young 
adults in this age bracket cannot purchase handguns from federally licensed dealers. 
However, a dangerous loophole allows them to purchase handguns and even assault 
pistols in a "private" transaction from any private individual, including the 
so-called "private collectors" who sell many firearms at gun shows. Young men 
in this age bracket commit a high percentage of the nation's violent crime but 
are still legally permitted to buy the weapons most typically used in those crimes.<br>
<br>
Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's largest citizens' gun 
control lobbying organization. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works to enact stronger 
federal, state and local gun control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. 
Founded in 1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local 
groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable gun control laws. More 
information about HCI and its affiliated organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence, can be found on their Web site at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org/">www.handguncontrol.org</a>.
