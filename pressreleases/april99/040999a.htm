YORK - April 9 - In a letter delivered today, the East Timor Action Network/U.S 
urges U.S. Secretary State Madeleine Albright to pressure the Indonesian government 
"to change their scorched-earth East Timor policy." The United States "should 
cut off all training and weapons transfers to the Indonesian military," ETAN writes.<br>
<br>
The letter follows a series of killings by paramilitaries armed by the Indonesian 
military in the Liquica region of East Timor earlier this week. Imprisoned resistance 
leader Xanana Gusmao then called for East Timorese guerrillas to defend themselves 
and the East Timorese population against paramilitary attacks.<br>
<br>
In the letter ETAN writes, "Unfortunately, neither the United States nor the international 
community has taken effective measures to persuade Indonesia to disarm the paramilitary 
forces or to reduce the number of troops."<br>
<br>
The letter was delivered as Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth prepared 
to depart for Indonesia.<br>
<br>
ETAN's letter says that paramilitary groups, armed by the Indonesian military 
have "shattered any semblance of peace" in the former Portuguese colony. The prospect 
of peace and a legitimate UN-sponsored vote by the East Timorese "requires an 
atmosphere where people in East Timor are free to express their views. ... When 
the [UN] 'Tripartite Talks" resume, Indonesia must commit to disarm the paramilitaries 
and pull their troops out of East Timor and take concrete steps to do it." The 
East Timor Action Network/U.S. supports genuine self-determination and human rights 
for the people of East Timor and democracy in Indonesia.<br>

<br>
(ETAN letterhead)<br>
April 9, 1999<br>
Hon. Madeleine K. Albright<br>
Department of State<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<br>
Dear Madame Secretary:<br>
<br>
We are writing to urge you to step up United States efforts to support the United 
Nations peace process in East Timor.<br>
<br>
As you know, the situation in the territory has deteriorated to the point where 
the East Timorese resistance was compelled to exercise their right to self-defense 
by ending their unilateral cease-fire. They could not stand by while their people 
continue to be slaughtered by Indonesia-backed paramilitary violence.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your meeting with resistance leader Xanana Gusmão in Jakarta last 
month, and the position you expressed during your visit: “… vigorous steps must 
be taken to break the cycle of violence on the ground. ... We see an urgent need 
to stabilize the situation through the disarmament of all paramilitary forces, 
as Xanana Gusmão has proposed and General Wiranto supports. We favor confidence-building 
measures, such as a reduction in the number of troops, and an international presence 
to reduce the prospects for future violence.”<br>
<br>
General Wiranto lied to you when he said he supported disarming the paramilitaries 
and those forces have escalated their murderous activities since your visit. It 
has become even more obvious that the Indonesian military has no interest in calling 
them to account. General Wiranto’s forces are not only supplying the paramilitaries 
with their weapons, but also participating in their bloody operations and providing 
them a safe haven.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, neither the United States nor the international community has taken 
effective measures to persuade Indonesia to disarm the paramilitary forces or 
to reduce the number of troops, and the cycle of violence has become an expanding 
spiral.<br>
<br>
On March 18, Assistant Secretary Stanley Roth told the Senate International Relations 
Committee “In the meantime -- and let me stress this point -- we have given a 
tremendous amount of attention, both publicly and privately, to breaking the cycle 
of violence on East Timor in the short term.” But it will take more than ”attention” 
from Washington to get ABRI to change their scorched-earth East Timor policy. 
The United States should cut off all training and weapons transfers to the Indonesian 
military. When Assistant Secretary Roth visits Indonesia next week, he should 
communicate this message in the strongest terms.<br>
<br>
In the wake of new massacres by paramilitary forces last weekend, and the Indonesian 
military’s declaration that they the will do nothing to rein in their “militias,” 
the East Timorese resistance leadership has authorized its armed forces (FALINTIL) 
to defend themselves and the East Timorese population. Xanana Gusmão believes 
that the “attitude of passivity” taken by the international community will not 
stop the killing of his people.<br>
<br>
The following day, paramilitaries murdered dozens of people in and outside a Catholic 
church in Liquica. More than 10,000 refugees from East Timorese villages are already 
taking shelter in churches, and this number will increase. Yayasan Hak reports 
that paramilitary activities in the Liquica area have killed 56 people during 
the past week.<br>
<br>
The responsibility for the escalation of violence falls squarely on the Indonesian 
military and on the international community, including the United States. For 
many months, Xanana Gusmão and his followers have exercised incredible restraint, 
suspending virtually all armed and nonviolent resistance activity while the UN-mediated 
process evolved. They trusted in the good faith of the Indonesian government’s 
proposal of a ballot consultation on an autonomy plan, and that the international 
community would ensure that the East Timorese people would be able to express 
their views without fear during that consultation.<br>
<br>
The United Nations has been unable even to send in monitors. UN officials do not 
see demilitarization of the paramilitary forces as a precondition for the balloting 
on autonomy. The United States and other international leaders have not been effective 
in their advocacy for an ongoing international presence. And the terror and killings 
inflicted by Indonesia’s “civilian militias” has increased.<br>
<br>
Mr. Gusmão has said that the resistance will lay down their weapons when there 
is a United Nations presence in East Timor. The United States needs to support 
that call in the strongest terms. Our country must provide the political will 
and the financial means to enable the UN to stop the spiral of violence.<br>
<br>
President Habibie’s advisor Dewi Fortuna Anwar recently said there was no need 
for an "outside party" (the United Nations) in East Timor, since the Indonesian 
armed forces are in East Timor only to keep the situation peaceful and secure. 
For more than twenty-three years, the Indonesian armed forces have brought only 
trauma and terror to East Timor. It is time for the United States to call the 
Indonesian government on its lies.<br>
<br>
The Indonesian government is still publicly committed to a peaceful solution including 
self-determination for the people of East Timor, although their army’s actions 
cast doubt on their sincerity. Indonesian leaders say that the resumption of FALINTIL 
self-defense operations could derail the “peace process.” But their paramilitary 
proxies have already shattered any semblance of peace. The UN process is more 
than agreements in New York -- it requires an atmosphere where people in East 
Timor are free to express their views. When the “Tripartite Talks” resume, Indonesia 
must commit to disarm the paramilitaries and pull their troops out of East Timor 
and take concrete steps to do it. Otherwise there is no peace process to derail.<br>
<br>
But it will not happen by itself, and it will take more than words from Washington. 
Please do what you can to achieve the confidence-building measures you outlined 
in Jakarta.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
