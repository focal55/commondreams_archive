          - April 6 - Momentum for passing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) 
          continues to expand, with an endorsement today from President Bill Clinton 
          at a White House press conference. Clinton joins Matthew Shepard’s mother, 
          Judy Shepard, in leading the charge to pass legislation that would extend 
          current federal hate crimes protection to cover gender, sexual orientation 
          and disability. According to HRC, new statistics released today by the 
          National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs showing increased savagery 
          in anti-gay attacks, as well yesterday’s sentencing of Russell A. Henderson, 
          one of two men accused of killing Matthew Shepard, punctuates the need 
          for state and federal hate crimes laws.<br>
          <br>
          “The President has always understood the importance of sending the message 
          that a hate crime committed against one American is a crime against 
          all Americans and is an assault on our society’s core values,” said 
          HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. “We hope Congress and lawmakers 
          in all 50 states can match President Clinton’s and Judy Shepard’s will, 
          determination and commitment to ending hate motivated violence.</font><font size=2><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000">” 
          </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><br>
          <br>
          In announcing his support for the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, President 
          Clinton put hate crimes against gay people in the context of ethnic 
          and religious conflicts in Kosovo, Rwanda, and elsewhere. Clinton called 
          on our nation to be an example for the world in tolerance and diversity.<br>
          <br>
          “Our diversity is a godsend for us, and the world of the 21st century,” 
          said Clinton at the press conference. “But it also has the potential 
          for the old, haunting demons that are hard to root out of the human 
          spirit. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would be important, substantively 
          and symbolically, to send a message to ourselves and to the world that 
          we are going into the 21st century determined to preach and to practice 
          what is right.”<br>
          <br>
          Clinton offered several methods to reduce hate crimes in America. The 
          President said he will ask the Justice and Education Departments to 
          provide hate crimes information in their annual report cards on school 
          safety. Clinton will ask the Department of Education to collect data 
          on hate crimes on college campuses. Clinton also announced the formation 
          of “a public-private partnership to help reach middle school students 
          to discuss this whole issue with them and talk about tolerance -- why 
          it is moral, as well as a practical imperative.”<br>
          <br>
          In a press conference last month, Mrs. Shepard announced her support 
          for the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, as well as passing state hate crimes 
          laws. Mrs. Shepard said hate crimes laws could potentially deter violent 
          acts by sending a clear message to would-be perpetrators that society 
          unequivocally condemns hate motivated violence.<br>
          <br>
          “No one will ever know if these laws would have saved...my son’s life. 
          But we can begin today by building a safer world for all Americans, 
          including gay and lesbian Americans,” said Mrs. Shepard at the press 
          conference. “On behalf of my family, I call on the Congress of the United 
          States to pass the hate Crimes Prevention Act without delay. ”<br>
          <br>
          The need for hate crimes legislation was highlighted by a survey released 
          today by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, which documented 
          2,552 anti-gay incidents in 1998. The national survey includes reports 
          from 16 coalition members in locations ranging from San Francisco to 
          Cleveland to El Paso, Texas. The survey showed an alarming increase 
          in the brutality of hate crimes, with chilling statistics that communicated 
          the intensity of anti-gay sentiment behind attacks.<br>
          <br>
          “What we found most disturbing was the attacks were more severe and 
          much more intense,” said Natalie Chin, a spokeswoman from the Community 
          United Against Violence, which gathered statistics for the survey in 
          San Francisco. “Attackers really seem motivated to debase their victims 
          and cause serious injury.”<br>
          <br>
          According to an article about the survey in the San Francisco Chronicle, 
          the use of weapons grew at an unprecedented pace. Reports of guns used 
          during assaults grew 71 percent; ropes and restraints, 133 percent; 
          vehicles, 150 percent; and the use of blunt objects, clubs, bats in 
          attacks grew by 47 percent.<br>
          <br>
          The survey follows murder suspect Russell A. Henderson’s guilty plea 
          yesterday in Laramie, Wyo. to felony murder, as well as the robbery 
          and kidnaping of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. Henderson’s 
          plea brought a swift conclusion to a nationally watched trial that may 
          have ended with the death penalty if Henderson was found guilty. District 
          Judge Jeffery A. Donnell sentenced Henderson to serve two consecutive 
          life sentences.<br>
          <br>
          According to the Associated Press, defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs said 
          that Henderson simply watched while co-defendant Aaron J. McKinney killed 
          Shepard with the butt of his gun. Skaggs also claimed that the slaying 
          was not premeditated. McKinney will stand trial for first degree murder, 
          aggravated robbery, and kidnaping in August. If convicted, he could 
          receive the death penalty.<br>
          <br>
          Henderson’s girlfriend pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact of 
          the murder on Dec. 23 and is awaiting sentencing. In May, McKinney’s 
          girlfriend goes on trial on an accessory charge, according to the AP 
          report.<br>
          <br>
          The Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) was introduced last month at a 
          press conference on Capitol Hill. A hearing in the Senate Judiciary 
          Committee on HCPA is scheduled for April 28.<br>
          <br>
          Hate crimes based on sexual orientation were up 8 percent in 1997, according 
          to the latest FBI statistics. Sexual orientation was the third highest 
          category of hate crimes behind race and religion and represented 14 
          percent of all hate crimes reported.<br>
          <br>
          Currently, hate crimes monitoring and enforcement consists of a patchwork 
          of laws that offer citizens varying levels of legal protection depending 
          on where they live. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have 
          hate crimes laws that include sexual orientation. Twenty one states 
          have laws that do not include sexual orientation. Eight states have 
          no hate crimes laws at all.<br>
          <br>
          The Human Rights Campaign is the nation’s largest national lesbian and 
          gay political organization, with members throughout the country, effectively 
          lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public 
          to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe 
          at home, at work, and in the community.<br>
