- April 12 - Sprawl is one of the most pervasive and menacing threats to face 
the nation’s rivers in years, according to American Rivers, a national river conservation 
organization.<br>
<br>
In a series of press conferences held around the country today, American Rivers 
announced this year’s list of the ten most endangered rivers in the country as 
part of the release of its 14th annual report, America’s Most Endangered Rivers 
of 1999.<br>
<br>
This year’s America’s Most Endangered Rivers report demonstrates for the first 
time how devastating unbridled development is to the nation’s rivers and catalogues 
areas where sprawl and rivers are on a head-on collision course.<br>
<br>
“We’ve all seen and felt sprawl - from lengthy commutes and crowded schools to 
polluted air and lost open space. It is seeping into every aspect of our lives. 
But few people understand the unique and devastating impacts of unplanned, rapid 
growth on rivers or the hardships that communities face from a wholesale degradation 
of rivers across the country. We have made great progress in cleaning up our rivers 
in the 25 years since the Clean Water Act, but sprawl is threatening to reverse 
those gains,” said Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers.<br>
<br>
Today, American Rivers called on local and state governments to reduce the damage 
sprawl causes to rivers. Governments must encourage re-development of high-density 
areas and make them more attractive and livable-in part by restoring urban riverfronts-to 
limit the amount of new impervious cover spreading out over the land. Governments 
must also encourage use of mass transit and carpools to reduce the need for more 
roads and parking lots. Further, local governments must set zoning standards for 
site development that reduce runoff and protect riverside lands.<br>
<br>
State and federal agencies should protect and restore rivers that are impaired 
by excessive water withdrawals. This can often be accomplished by encouraging 
water conservation by pricing water sensibly, as well as through existing laws 
such as the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and state water laws. 
Water allocation plans must recognize the needs of fish, wildlife, and humans.<br>
<br>
Sprawl chews up riverbanks, wetlands and floodplains, critical components of a 
river ecosystem that provide wildlife habitat, filter sediment and toxins, and 
act like sponges to absorb floodwaters. Paving over the land with roads, parking 
lots, rooftops, and anything else that can’t absorb rainwater creates “impervious 
cover” and dramatically increases the amount of polluted runoff flowing into rivers 
and streams. Impervious cover causes more frequent and severe flooding and leads 
to streambank erosion and habitat loss. According to the Center for Watershed 
Protection, when 10% of a watershed is sealed under such cover, the rivers and 
streams that receive its runoff will be degraded. And when 25-40% of a watershed 
is paved over, its rivers and streams can often no longer support fish and wildlife 
and are not safe for human uses.<br>
<br>
In the Seattle area, uncontrolled development is sucking excessive amounts of 
water from the Cedar River and runoff is polluting the water that remains-destroying 
the river’s fragile salmon and steelhead runs. Chicago’s rampant growth is overloading 
the suburban area’s sewage treatment system, forcing an increasing number of regular 
discharges into the Fox River to get rid of the excess.<br>
<br>
While sprawl increases water pollution, it also increases human demand for water. 
Desperately in need of water to serve exploding populations, urban areas are pumping 
water directly from nearby rivers - or from area aquifers that feed rivers - at 
alarming rates and with devastating impacts for fish and wildlife.<br>
<br>
The suburbs of Atlanta are diverting more and more water from the Coosa and Tallapoosa 
headwaters which feed an Alabama river basin, one of the richest sources of freshwater 
aquatic animals in the world. Sierra Vista, Arizona is depleting groundwater so 
quickly that flows in the San Pedro River, one of the country’s most important 
migratory bird flyways, are already down by 30%. Salt Lake City’s wasteful water 
consumption is reducing flows in the Bear River and threatening one of the world’s 
most remarkable bird refuges.<br>
<br>
“The rivers flowing across our country are precious beyond words. Few people realize 
that the United States supports the greatest diversity of freshwater animal species 
in the world. But at the same time, freshwater animals are the most threatened 
group of species in the country. The loss of these species is a warning to us. 
If sprawl continues to ravage rivers, we will lose not only wildlife but also 
our drinking water supplies and economic and recreational opportunities,” added 
Wodder.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the same rivers that are now being ravaged by sprawl are in some regions 
serving as an effective antidote to sprawl, according to Wodder. Rather than being 
eyesores and dumpsites, urban rivers are actually helping to reverse sprawl by 
drawing people and businesses back to the core of the city.<br>
<br>
“Healthy rivers are the lifeblood of our communities. Virtually every major city 
and thousands of towns across the country rest on the banks of a river. Today, 
more and more of us want to get out of our cars and back into nature, and our 
local rivers offer the most appealing and convenient destinations. A river renaissance 
is sweeping the country: urban and rural communities everywhere are rediscovering 
and revitalizing the waterways that flow through them. As rivers and riverside 
parks become cleaner and more attractive, people of all ages, cultures, and income 
levels can enjoy a heightened quality of life,” stated Wodder.<br>
<br>
While sprawl puts rivers at risk all over the country, a host of other chronic 
threats continue to damage waterways, including mining waste which pollutes and 
buries waterways, dams which block rivers and kill fish, and riverbank manipulation 
which destroys plantlife and animal habitat.<br>
<br>
One of the gravest problems this year is occurring on the lower Snake River in 
Washington State, named the most endangered river in America. Over a million salmon 
and steelhead once migrated up the Snake every year. But today, the river’s salmon 
runs are close to extinction because four dams on the lower river have destroyed 
its natural flow.<br>
<br>
American Rivers’ 14th annual report examines and ranks rivers that this year face 
the most serious and immediate degradation and provides an overview of the state 
of rivers today. The purpose of the report is to call attention to these threats 
and mobilize communities around protecting and restoring locally and nationally 
significant waterways.<br>
<br>
1999 MOST ENDANGERED RIVERS IN AMERICA<br>
<br>
1. LOWER SNAKE RIVER, Washington State Threat: federal dams Dams on the lower 
Snake River have brought salmon and steelhead to the brink of extinction. Since 
the early 1970's, fish populations, once numbering over a million, have dropped 
by nearly 90%. By the end of this year, the Clinton Administration must produce 
a Snake River salmon recovery plan. Scientists agree that the cornerstone of the 
plan must include removal of four dams on the lower Snake to let the river flow 
naturally.<br>
<br>
2. MISSOURI RIVER, Midwest Threat: channelization, dams, bank stabilization, poor 
grazing practices Once one of the world’s most dynamic rivers, much of the Missouri 
has been channelized into a barge canal, blocked by gigantic dams, and cut off 
from its floodplain by flood control levees. Now the river’s few remaining wild 
sections are in trouble from efforts to stabilize banks by lining them with rock, 
overgrazing fragile riversides, and dams that disrupt the river’s flow and kill 
fish.<br>
<br>
3. ALABAMA-COOSA-TALLAPOOSA RIVER BASIN, Georgia, Alabama Threat: sprawl, water 
withdrawals, pollution Atlanta, the most sprawling city in the country, is growing 
so fast it threatens the health of nearby water sources, including the headwaters 
of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers, which feed a major river basin in the state 
of Alabama -- home to one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world.<br>
<br>
4. SAN PEDRO RIVER, Arizona and Sonora, Mexico Threat: sprawl, groundwater pumping 
With most of Arizona's riverside areas already damaged, the San Pedro is the last 
best example of a rich and healthy natural community in the southwestern US. The 
exploding community of Sierra Vista, AZ and the Army base of Fort Huachuca are 
pumping water out of the region’s aquifer - which maintains the river’s year-round 
flows - faster than it can be replenished.<br>
<br>
5. YELOWSTONE RIVER, Montana, North Dakota Threat: bank stabilization, flood control 
One of the nation’s last freely meandering rivers, the Yellowstone is turning 
into an armored channel lined with rock. The Army Corps of Engineers is permitting 
more and more property owners to stabilize the river’s banks with rocks and build 
flood control levees. As the river becomes an armored channel, wildlife habitat 
is destroyed, and a blue-ribbon trout fishery is under assault.<br>
<br>
6. CEDAR RIVER, Washington State Threat: sprawl, water withdrawals Seattle sprawl 
may destroy what is left of the Cedar River’s fragile salmon and steelhead runs. 
The Cedar River contains some of the highest quality fish habitat left in the 
Lake Washington watershed. Seattle’s proposed plan to take up to 70% of the river’s 
water to fuel suburban growth could have devastating impacts on the fish.<br>
<br>
7. FOX RIVER, Illinois, Wisconsin Threat: sprawl, pollution, state agency inaction 
Sewage and suburban runoff from the Chicago area are polluting the Fox River and 
threatening drinking supplies for 200,000 people. The amount of treated sewage 
regularly released into the river from wastewater treatment plants -- already 
ill equipped to handle Chicago's growth -- is expected to increase by 50% by the 
year 2010.<br>
<br>
8. CARMEL RIVER, California Threat: sprawl, water withdrawals, dams Monterey County, 
the fastest growing county in the state, is developing the watershed at an extremely 
rapid rate. As a result, more and more water is being pulled out of the river- 
much of it illegally - to serve exploding populations, harming wildlife and their 
habitat. The county is taking a knee jerk reaction to the water supply problem 
by proposing to build a new dam -- without considering other more cost effective 
and environmentally preferable alternatives such as water conservation.<br>
<br>
9. COAL RIVER, West Virginia Threat: mountaintop removal coal mining The Coal 
River is threatened by the largest mountaintop mine ever proposed in West Virginia's 
long history of coal mining. The coal would be extracted by decapitating entire 
mountaintops and dumping millions of tons of leftover rock and soil into the valleys 
and rivers below.<br>
<br>
10. BEAR RIVER, Utah Threat: sprawl, water withdrawals, proposed dam Wasteful 
water consumption in Salt Lake City is reducing flows in the Bear River and damaging 
one of the world’s most remarkable bird refuges. Instead of creating incentives 
to control wasteful water practices, the water district wants to build a dam that 
would cost taxpayers millions of dollars and may reduce water to the refuge even 
more. </font></font><FONT SIZE=2>
