    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">NEW YORK - July 15 - The most comprehensive assessment ever made of
    threats to vanishing species in the US has found that alien species are behind the
    disappearance of nearly half of the imperiled species in the United States. Alien species
    are plants and animals that are not native to a given region, but which have been brought
    there by people. Some are brought there accidentally aboard ships or planes; others are
    intentionally released. Once in these new areas, they can increase in numbers and displace
    native species from their habitats. <br>
    <br>
    The study, jointly prepared by scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), The
    Nature Conservancy, and the Smithsonian Institution, appears as the cover story in the
    August issue of BioScience, to be released on Friday (7/17). Only habitat loss ranks as a
    more serious threat, affecting 85% of our vanishing species, while alien species affect
    49%. Alien species rank well ahead of pollution (24%), overharvest (17%), and disease (3%)
    as threats to biodiversity. Agriculture and commercial development are identified as the
    two most widespread causes of habitat loss for wildlife, affecting 38% of imperiled
    species, followed by commercial development (35%) and water development (30%). <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Alien invasion is the least recognized threat to wildlife today. People understand
    that habitat destruction and pollution are harmful to wildlife. But they don't realize
    that alien plant and animal species are everywhere, growing in our forests and grasslands,
    swimming in our lakes and rivers, and driving native species to the brink of
    extinction,&quot; said EDF senior ecologist Dr. David S. Wilcove, lead author of the
    peer-reviewed article. <br>
    <br>
    The article, &quot;Quantifying Threats to Imperiled Species in the United States,&quot;
    ranks the threats to 1,880 rare species and subspecies of birds, mammals, reptiles,
    amphibians, fishes, mussels, butterflies, beetles, dragonflies, other invertebrates, and
    plants. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Simply protecting habitats from further development won't do the trick for most of
    our endangered species. We need to control invasive, alien plants and animals that are
    degrading the remaining habitats. That takes time and money,&quot; said Wilcove. &quot;Tax
    credits and direct grants are needed for landowners who agree to manage their properties
    in ways beneficial to endangered species, including controlling harmful alien
    species.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The Environmental Defense Fund, a leading national, NY-based nonprofit organization,
    represents 300,000 members. EDF links science, economics, and law to create innovative,
    equitable and economically viable solutions to today's environmental problems. <p align="center">###</td>
