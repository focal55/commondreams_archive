    Demands Defunding Of National Endowment For The Arts While Accepting NEA Grant Money!</strong></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 16 - Although TV preacher Pat Robertson continues to
    demand the defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts, new evidence released today
    by a church-state watchdog group shows that Robertson has asked for and received NEA grant
    money.<br>
    <br>
    According to Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Robertson's Regent
    University applied for a grant from the Virginia Council for the Arts during the Fall 1997
    Project Grant round. Robertson's school was awarded $1,000 for &quot;Pavel's
    Chariot,&quot; a film recently completed and shown in the annual Regent University Film
    Festival in Virginia Beach, Va.<br>
    <br>
    The Virginia state agency distributes $3.4 million in arts grants, of which $523,000 comes
    from the NEA. The film's credits note funding from both the Virginia Council for the Arts
    and the NEA.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Robertson's hypocrisy has been legendary for some time, but this is
    ridiculous,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;If a
    multi-millionaire like Robertson is so opposed to public arts funding, one has to wonder
    why he would go to the government for a handout.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Yesterday, Robertson's political group, the Christian Coalition, issued a press release
    calling for the end of the NEA. The release, which was distributed in connection with an
    anticipated House vote on shutting down the NEA, quotes Coalition Executive Director Randy
    Tate as saying, &quot;Let's fully privatize the arts and end welfare for the artistic
    left.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't know about Randy, but I'd hardly call Regent University the 'artistic
    left,'&quot; Lynn said. &quot;Clearly, Robertson and Company have a double standard.
    Government subsidies for them are fine, but they don't want anyone else to benefit.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded
    in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied houses of worship in all 50
    states.<p align="center">-30- </td>
