    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 15 - Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, Senator Frank
    Lautenberg of New Jersey and Representative Charles Schumer of New York today introduced a
    bill that will establish a minimum three-day waiting period for the purchase of firearms
    when the original Brady Law sunsets at the end of November, 1998. The original Brady Law,
    which mandated a waiting period and background check for all handgun purchasers, is due to
    be replaced by a National Instant Check System (NICS), which relies on computerized
    federal data to immediately check prospective firearms purchasers for felony convictions
    and other barriers to purchase. Without a mandatory waiting period, local police
    departments will not have time to participate in the background check, and gun purchasers
    considering crimes of passion or impulse suicides will no longer have a
    &quot;cooling-off&quot; period to protect themselves or their victims.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need to protect the Brady Law&#146;s waiting period for gun purchases so that
    there is time for the police to check the records on the buyer and time for tempers to
    cool,&quot; said Senator Durbin, who has long supported stricter standards for the
    ownership and use of guns. &quot;We can not allow the gun lobby to override the police and
    endanger American families.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Since the implementation of the Brady Law in 1994, almost a quarter-million prohibited
    purchasers have been stopped from buying handguns in gun stores. Additionally, a 1997
    study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence demonstrated that states that began
    conducting background checks on handgun purchasers when the Brady Act was implemented in
    1994 are as much as 86% less likely to be sources of guns used in crimes in other states
    than they were prior to when the checks were performed. Despite a 1997 Supreme Court
    decision that struck down the federal mandate for background checks based on Tenth
    Amendment limits on federal power to enforce commands to state and local officials, more
    than 95% of the nation&#146;s law enforcement officers continue to do background checks on
    a voluntary basis.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Police support the original Brady provisions because they know that waiting periods
    save lives,&quot; said Sarah Brady, Handgun Control, Inc. chair. &quot;The Justice
    Department has done its job, but the federal database will not contain many of the records
    that police would use to disqualify firearms purchasers. The police need time to provide
    that information to gun dealers and federal authorities, and to discourage ordinary people
    who want a gun immediately for a crime of passion or suicide.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Brady Law, first introduced in 1987, took seven years to pass Congress and garner
    White House support. The sunset provisions eliminating the waiting period after five years
    in favor of Instant Check were contained in a successful amendment sponsored by the
    National Rifle Association. The amendment&#146;s passage allowed the NRA to claim a
    victory to its membership and to the public &#150; despite its long fight against the
    Brady Bill and despite the amendment&#146;s provision that will extend background checks
    to long guns on November 30. <br>
    <br>
    Every national public opinion poll since the early &#145;90&#146;s has demonstrated
    overwhelming support from the American public, including gunowners, for both background
    checks and waiting periods. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are about to take a giant step backward in the fight to keep guns out of the
    hands of criminals&quot;, said Representative Charles Schumer, who authored the Brady Law
    which passed the House in 1993. &quot;We shall see if this Congress can stand up to the
    NRA to do what everyone knows is right.&quot;<p align="center">###</td>
