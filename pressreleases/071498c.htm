    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 14 - A coalition of organizations will answer an
    anti-gay&nbsp; newspaper ad campaign, launched by several right-wing groups, with a full
    &nbsp; page ad in Wednesday's edition of USA Today.&nbsp; The coalition ad will highlight
    a Minneapolis family who loves and supports their lesbian daughter and it will also
    counter the myths propagated by the Religious Right, according to HRC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our ad will show that the Far Right does
    not have a monopoly on family values and religion. Gay people are no less religious or
    family-oriented than anyone else.&nbsp; The Right's on-going character assassination of an
    entire group of people is offensive to millions of gay <br>
    Americans and their family members,&quot; said HRC executive director Elizabeth Birch.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coalition's ad features Dave and Ruth
    Waterbury, Republican, church-going, Minneapolis parents and their lesbian daughter,
    Margie.&nbsp; In the ad, the Waterburys make an appeal to the American people to treat
    their daughter with dignity and respect so she can live her life free of discrimination.
    &nbsp; The ad was produced by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and is sponsored by the
    Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund, Gay,
    Lesbian, Straight Education Network, The Gill Foundation, Human Rights Campaign
    Foundation, National Black Lesbian &amp; Gay Leadership Forum, An Uncommon Legacy
    Foundation, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force,
    National Latina/o LGBT Organization, National Youth Advocacy Coalition, Parents, Families
    &amp; Friends of Lesbians &amp; Gays.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right-wing ad campaign is the latest in a
    series of on-going attacks directed against gay Americans by religious political
    activists. In an effort to appease Focus On The Family's James Dobson,&nbsp; Senate
    Majority Leader Trent Lott kicked off a wave of anti-gay rhetoric when he recently said
    that homosexuality was a sin and likened gays to alcoholics and kleptomaniacs. His
    comments were followed by disparaging remarks about gay people by several public officials
    including Senator Don Nickles (R-Okla.), Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX.) and Sen. Jesse Helms
    (R-N.C.).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first full page right-wing ad, which
    appeared in Monday's edition of the New York Times, a woman claimed she was made gay
    because she was molested and later became heterosexual by finding God.&nbsp; A similar ad
    appeared in the Washington Post today and another is expected to appear in USA Today later
    this week.&nbsp; The campaign is sponsored by fifteen organizations representing political
    religious activists including the Family Research Council, the American Family Association
    and the Christian Coalition.&nbsp; Today, the American Psychological Association
    questioned the efficacy of so-called &quot;conversion therapy.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For nearly three decades, it has been
    known that homosexuality is not a mental illness.&nbsp; Medical and mental health
    professionals also now know that sexual orientation is not a choice and cannot be altered.
    &nbsp; Groups who try to change the sexual orientation of people through so-called
    `conversion therapy' are misguided and run the risk of causing a great deal of
    psychological harm to those they say they are trying to help,&quot; said American
    Psychological Association Executive Director Dr. Raymond Fowler.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 1997, the American
    Psychological Association overwhelmingly passed a resolution, at the APA convention, that
    asserts that there is no sound scientific evidence on the efficacy of &quot;reparative
    therapy,&quot; which seeks to &quot;cure&quot; homosexuals.&nbsp; In 1973, the American
    Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human Rights Campaign is the largest
    national lesbian and gay political organization, with members throughout the country. It
    effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure
    that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the
    community. <br>
