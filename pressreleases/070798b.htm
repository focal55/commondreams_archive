    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 7 - The following was released today by Physicians for
    Social Responsibility:<br>
    <br>
    President Clinton announced today that arms control is on the agenda for his visit to
    Russia this September. Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) applauds this decision
    and calls on the president to use this historic opportunity to reverse what has been until
    now, a disappointing series of failed nuclear policies.<br>
    <br>
    President Bush signed two strategic arms reduction agreements, but after six years in
    office President Clinton has failed to complete any. After a promising start to the
    Clinton administration with the extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and
    completion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the CTBT is now in trouble in the
    U.S. Senate and nonproliferation efforts are unraveling. The United States and Russia
    still possess a combined total of more than 18,000 operational nuclear weapons, a number
    only slightly lower than at the end of the Cold War.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;START II is languishing on the point of collapse and might never be ratified,&quot;
    said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., executive director of PSR. &quot;Urgent resuscitation efforts
    are needed to keep the strategic arms reduction process alive. President Clinton should
    begin immediate negotiations with President Yeltsin on START III, and on removing nuclear
    warheads from hair-trigger alert status.<br>
    <br>
    This might provide the jump start needed to revive disarmament efforts and prolong the
    life of both countries.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There is nothing less than the health of the entire planet at stake in these
    decisions,&quot; said Ira Helfand, M.D., past president of PSR. &quot;Russian weapons are
    less secure than at any time in history. Morale is low. The chain of command is not
    intact. Threats of terrorism or an accident are greater than ever. Time is not on our
    side. Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin simply must not pass up this chance to de-alert
    nuclear weapons and make significant progress on START III.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Until now, President Clinton has refused to schedule an official visit to Russia,
    suggesting that he would visit only when the Duma ratified START II. PSR members are
    delighted at the president's new decision and believe that it is not too late for him to
    still achieve a START III agreement before he leaves office. But it will require making
    arms reductions a high priority and a willingness to apply the kinds of bold life support
    measures needed in an emergency situation.<br>
