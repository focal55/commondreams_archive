    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - August 3 - The following was released today by the
    Institute for Public Accuracy:<p> An article in The Baltimore Sun has raised sharp
    questions about the failure of an influential American think tank to disclose that it
    received major funding from the South Korean government while repeatedly testifying on
    Capitol Hill about U.S.-Korean relations. </p>
    <p>Witnesses from the Heritage Foundation have presented Congressional testimony on U.S.
    policies toward North Korea and South Korea on several occasions in recent years, the Aug.
    2 article says,but the think tank did not inform House committee members that it had
    received $1 million from the South Korean government. The testimony occurred during and
    after the three-year period when the funds flowed from a conduit for the Seoul government
    to the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, the article noted. </p>
    <p>Ironically, in 1995 -- while it was still receiving funds from the South Korean
    government -- the Heritage Foundation launched a campaign to require that all recipients
    of grants from the U.S. government disclose federal funding when they testify on Capitol
    Hill, the article says. Last month, Heritage issued a report card that graded compliance
    with a &quot;Truth in Testimony&quot; rule adopted by the House of Representatives in
    January 1997. </p>
    <p>Sunday's article in The Baltimore Sun was written by Norman Solomon, executive director
    of the Institute for Public Accuracy.The institute, based in Washington and San Francisco,
    is a national consortium of policy researchers. </p>
    <p>&quot;The nation's capital, of course, is a place where double standards are
    routine,&quot; the article said. &quot;But consider this recent feat of ultra-hypocrisy: A
    few weeks ago, on July 14, the Heritage Foundation issued a report condemning lax
    compliance with a congressional rule that requires witnesses to disclose funding from the
    U.S. government.</p>
    <p> &quot;The `Truth in Testimony' rule -- first proposed by Heritage in May 1995 and
    adopted by the House of Representatives in January 1997 -- seems intended to stigmatize
    grants from the public sector. Heritage hails this as a `significant victory' because the
    rule `helps expose potential conflicts of interest:witnesses who testify for greater
    federal spending on programs that provide them with income.' </p>
    <p>&quot;Eager to tighten the rule,&quot; the article continued, &quot;Heritage has even
    issued report cards that grade enforcement by House committees and single out
    non-disclosing groups. Among the culprits fingered by the Heritage Foundation are
    witnesses from such outfit as the United Brotherhood of Carpenters (federal grant:
    $33,611), the Wildlife Society ($25,000), the Passaic River Coalition ($24,000) and the
    American Dental Association ($3,592,256). </p>
    <p>&quot;But what happens when an American organization pockets $1 million from a foreign
    government -- and testifies repeatedly in front of Congress about what U.S. policy should
    be toward that government --without disclosing the financial ties involved? Hey, no
    problem.&quot; </p>
    <p>Making the irony more acute is the fact that the &quot;Truth in Testimony&quot; rule
    championed by Heritage requires that witnesses who appear before House committees disclose
    federal grants received not only during the current fiscal year but also during the
    previous two fiscal years. According to the article, &quot;if the words
    `foreign-government grants' were substituted for `federal grants,'then Heritage would have
    been in repeated violation of the rule during the past few years.&quot;</p>
