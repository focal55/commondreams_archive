    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - July 22 - Oregonians are nearly unanimous in their support
    for Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), according to a new
    bipartisan, statewide poll released today. When asked: &quot;Do you think the U.S. Senate
    should approve a Treaty with 140 other countries that would prohibit underground nuclear
    weapons explosions worldwide,&quot; 86% of Oregon voters say the treaty should be approved
    and more than three-quarters (76%) of whom &quot;strongly support&quot; approval. Only 10%
    say it should not be approved. Support for the treaty is overwhelming among Republicans
    (84% approve), Democrats (87% approve) and independents (91% approve). Indeed, support
    cuts across every demographic and geographic group. Support for the CTBT in Oregon (86%)
    is even higher than it is nationwide (73%, according to a May 1998 survey).<br>
    <br>
    The poll was commissioned by the Coalition to Reduce&nbsp; Nuclear Dangers, a non-partisan
    alliance of 17 of the&nbsp; nation's leading arms control organizations. The survey
    &nbsp; results are based on the findings of an opinion survey&nbsp; of 400 registered
    Oregon voters conducted by Wirthlin&nbsp; Worldwide, a Republican polling firm, and a
    &nbsp; Democratic firm, The Mellman Group from June 20-&nbsp; 24, 1998. The statistical
    margin of error is plus or&nbsp; minus 4.9%.<br>
    <br>
    The test ban treaty was submitted to the Senate last&nbsp; year, but the Senate has so far
    failed to act on the&nbsp; treaty, which has gained new significance since India&nbsp; and
    Pakistan conducted nuclear blasts in May and June.&nbsp; The current Chairman of the Joint
    Chiefs of staff and&nbsp; four previous chairmen, including Gen. Colin Powell,&nbsp; have
    endorsed the CTBT.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now is the time for Congressional leaders to act, not to delay or stand idly by. The
    test ban treaty is clearly in our security interests and Oregonians and the vast majority
    of Americans wholeheartedly agree. Unfortunately, a very few Senate leaders are unwisely
    blocking a vote -- and even debate -- on the treaty,&quot; says former Oregon Congressman
    Michael J. Kopetski, author of the 1992 law that led to the current U.S. nuclear test
    moratorium.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;President Clinton and the Senate must work together to stop nuclear testing before
    the seeds of nuclear proliferation take stronger root in South Asia and elsewhere around
    the globe,&quot; he added.<br>
    <br>
    Oregonians See Test Ban As &quot;More Important&quot; After South Asian Nuclear Tests:<br>
    <br>
    Despite the&nbsp; repeated calls, Senate leaders Trent Lott (R-MS) and Jesse Helms (R-NC)
    have defied public opinion and labeled the treaty &quot;irrelevant.&quot; Such thinking is
    out of step with the views of Oregonians. Eighty percent of Oregonians said that they
    think the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan &quot;demonstrate how important it is
    for the U.S. to ratify and encourage global implementation of the CTBT.&quot; Oregonians
    have a high level of awareness of the nuclear testing by India and Pakistan. Eighty-seven
    percent of Oregon voters say the have heard about the tests, with 86% saying the tests
    pose a &quot;serious threat to international security.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oregon voters were also asked whether they &quot;favor&quot; or &quot;oppose&quot; a
    variety of possible U.S. government responses to the tests by India and Pakistan. An
    overwhelming 90% favor urging India and Pakistan to approve the test ban and 79% favor
    U.S. ratification of the CTBT as the best responses. These proposals were far more popular
    than imposing strong economic and political sanctions (62% in favor, 27% opposed), or
    increasing military spending to develop and deploy a nuclear missile defense (23% in
    favor, 73% opposed).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Senate's do-nothing approach on the test ban treaty is irresponsible and
    dangerous. It hurts efforts to protect America and the world from the proliferation of
    nuclear weapons and the possibility of nuclear war. The overwhelming public support for
    the test ban is a wake-up call for the Senate to approve the treaty and stop nuclear
    blasts worldwide,&quot; says Daryl Kimball, Director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear
    Dangers.<br>
    <br>
    Another survey question reveals that when given the choice between two possible candidates
    for Senate -- one who supports the CTBT and the other who opposes the CTBT -- 73% of
    Oregonians solidly prefer a candidate who supports the CTBT, while only 20% would support
    a candidate who opposes the treaty.<p align="center">-- 30 --</p>
