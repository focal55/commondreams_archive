    <td valign="top" width="75%" style="font-family: MS Sans Serif, Arial; font-size: 10pt" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">WASHINGTON - September 1 - Nearly three months after the Wisconsin
    Supreme Court upheld a private school voucher program, Americans United for Separation of
    Church and State, a national church-state watchdog group that helped sponsor the legal
    challenge to the program, has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.<p>&quot;The Wisconsin
    ruling was the greatest distortion of the principle of church-state separation in modern
    history,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;We're
    asking the Supreme Court to nail shut the coffin on these reckless experiments with public
    education and the First Amendment.&quot;</p>
    <p>In <i>Jackson v. Benson</i>, a Wisconsin district court ruled in January 1997 that the
    Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP) may not pay tuition at denominational schools. In
    August of that year, a state appeals court agreed, citing the Wisconsin Constitution
    prohibition on taxpayer funding of religious instruction. On June 10, 1998, however, the
    Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed those rulings.</p>
    <p>The appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on Monday, Aug. 31. &quot;The Wisconsin
    Supreme Court's decision told taxpayers that they can be forced to support private
    religious education,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;This is unacceptable. Vouchers strike at the
    heart of the First Amendment, and we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will uphold
    democratic principles that keep church and state separate.&quot;</p>
    <p>Lynn noted that state courts in Ohio and Vermont have struck down voucher aid and that
    just last month an appeals court in Maine also rejected taxpayer aid to religious schools.</p>
    <p>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C.
    Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied houses of worship
    in all 50 states. AU has been a part of legal challenges to every voucher program passed
    in the country.</p>
    <p>Americans United brought legal action against the Milwaukee voucher program along with
    several other organizations, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
    National Education Association and People For the American Way.</p>
