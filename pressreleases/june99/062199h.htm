<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- June 21 - The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives continues 
to delay a vote on the bipartisan campaign finance reform bill introduced by Representatives 
Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Martin Meehan (D-MA), according to reform proponents, 
and has instead decided to hold a series of campaign finance reform hearings described 
by Common Cause as "an effort to distract and an effort to stall." </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The House Administration 
Committee, chaired by Representative Bill Thomas (R-CA), last week held the first 
in what is expected to be a series of hearings on campaign finance reform extending 
until the August recess. "Chairman Thomas' claim that these hearings are part 
of a 'constructive debate' on campaign finance reform is absurd on its face," 
Common Cause Acting President Donald J. Simon said. "These hearings have one purpose 
and one purpose only - to delay and do little on reform for as long as possible."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to Common Cause, 
the House has held at least 11 hearings on campaign finance reform since 1995, 
and debated the issue on the floor for more than 50 hours over 14 days when the 
full House considered Shays-Meehan and other proposals last August. At the end 
of the debate, the House passed the Shays-Meehan bill on a bipartisan 252-179 
vote which included one-fourth of House Republicans. "The House has already expressed 
its will on the matter, but Chairman Thomas wants to go back and study it some 
more," Simon said. "No Member lacks information on this issue."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The hearings are part of 
a strategy led by House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) and the House Republican 
leadership to delay action on Shays-Meehan, according to Common Cause, and to 
push consideration of reform into an election year when the issue can become mired 
in partisan politics.</font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PHONY REFORM PROPOSALS</b><br>
In addition to holding hearings, the House Republican leadership, led by Majority 
Whip Tom DeLay (R-TX), is offering up phony bills designed to resemble reform 
legislation, but which would actually make matters much worse, according to reform 
supporters.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In May, Representative 
Asa Hutchinson (R-AR) reintroduced legislation which purports to include a ban 
on soft money, but which would leave a gaping loophole that would allow soft money 
to be funneled into federal elections through state party committees, rather than 
national party committees. In the last Congress, the Republican leadership used 
the Hutchinson bill, with its fatally flawed soft money provision, to try to siphon 
votes from the Shays-Meehan bill, but in the end, it fell far short of a majority, 
while Shays-Meehan passed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Also in May, Representative 
DeLay and Representative John Doolittle (R-CA) introduced a campaign finance bill 
to repeal all existing federal limits on how much money individuals or parties 
can contribute to candidates, and to establish a campaign finance system that 
relies solely on disclosure of big money. </font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The aptly named Doolittle-DeLay 
legislation not only fails the test of reform, it's anti-reform," Simon said. 
"It shamelessly increases the role of big money in federal elections, and serves 
as a sideshow that seeks to distract the country and the Congress from passing 
real reform. By abolishing all limits on money in federal campaigns, it does away 
with the distinction between hard and soft money, thereby allowing federal candidates 
to inject any amount of money from any source directly into their campaigns."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While Majority Whip DeLay 
has often sung the praises of full disclosure as the only kind of law that is 
needed to regulate money in politics, his recent actions cast doubt on the sincerity 
of his commitment to disclosure, says Common Cause. According to <i>The Washington 
Post</i>, DeLay recently shifted the registration one of one of his leadership 
PACs out of the state of Virginia in order to escape the state's campaign finance 
disclosure requirements. By incorporating his leadership PAC under Virginia state 
law instead of federal law, DeLay had been able to raise unlimited amounts of 
money while avoiding federal disclosure requirements. "But apparently, even Virginia's 
rather meek disclosure requirements were too much for Mr. DeLay," said Simon.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In addition, Majority Whip 
DeLay is spearheading a controversial new effort to elect more Republicans to 
Congress while avoiding federal contribution limits and disclosure requirements. 
According to published reports, the goal of the Republican Majority Issues Campaign, 
organized under Section 527 of the tax code and affiliated with Representative 
DeLay, is to raise $25 million in unlimited - and undisclosed - soft money from 
corporations and individuals during the 2000 election cycle. Because the group 
is organized under Section 527 of the tax code but not registered as a political 
committee with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the group is not disclosing 
its donors to the FEC or the public, even though its acknowledged purpose is to 
support or oppose candidates. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to Common Cause, 
these new fundraising schemes - leadership PACs which raise soft money and Section 
527 organizations which use unregulated and undisclosed funds to affect federal 
elections - represent an alarming new trend which threatens to undermine any remaining 
constraints on the role of special-interest money in elections. "Majority Whip 
DeLay and the Republican leadership talk about the importance of full disclosure 
on the one hand, but then leap through loopholes to avoid disclosing their donors 
on the other," said Simon. "These schemes are nothing more than new vehicles for 
special interests to pour ever increasing amounts of soft money into federal campaigns 
and now to do it without even any disclosure." The bipartisan Shays-Meehan campaign 
finance reform bill would shut down these vehicles. The bill bans soft money - 
the unregulated, unlimited contributions from corporations, labor unions, and 
wealthy individuals - and deals effectively with the problem of campaign ads masquerading 
as issue discussion. The bill also provides for greater public disclosure by requiring 
electronic filing of federal campaign finance reports which would then be made 
available on the Internet.</font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>DISCHARGE PETITION</b><br>
In order to force the House leadership to schedule debate on Shays-Meehan before 
next fall, congressional reform leaders have been collecting signatures on a discharge 
petition introduced by conservative "Blue Dog" Democrats, repeating a strategy 
which last year forced then-Speaker Newt Gingrich to schedule consideration of 
Shays-Meehan. Reformers currently have 202 of the 218 signatures required to extract 
the bill from committee and get a fair and timely vote on the House floor. This 
total includes 195 Democrats, one Independent, and six Republicans: Representatives 
Chris Shays (CT), Mike Castle (DE), Mike Forbes (NY), Greg Ganske (IA), Nancy 
Johnson (CT), and Connie Morella (MD). </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> However, because of the 
arcane rules that govern discharge petitions, time is running out on the Blue 
Dog petition. To have any realistic prospect of forcing a vote on Shays-Meehan 
in the House this summer, the petition would have to reach the 218 mark by the 
July 4th congressional recess. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Reform supporters had hoped 
for House consideration of Shays-Meehan prior to action by the Senate. But given 
the House Republican leadership's plan to delay floor consideration until September 
at the earliest, reform supporters have begun discussions with Senate reform leaders 
John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI), who have indicated they are ready 
to jump-start the fight in the Senate prior to the August recess if needed. "The 
House Republican leadership's strategy is to kill reform by running out the clock 
so that reform is pushed into an election year when it becomes more vulnerable 
to partisan posturing," Simon said. "Reform supporters inside and outside of Congress 
will fight back and continue to press for congressional action as early as possible 
this year."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Attached is the list of 
26 Republican Members of the House who are cosponsors of the Shays-Meehan bill, 
but have not signed the discharge petition, and the list of all Democrats who 
have not signed the discharge petition. For more information, contact the Common 
Cause Press Office at 202/736-5770. </font>
