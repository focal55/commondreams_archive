- June 29 - Amnesty International calls for a full retrial of Kurdistan Workers 
Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Öcalan who was sentenced to death on 29 June 1999. 
</font> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Abdullah Öcalan should 
be retried before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal and under conditions 
which ensure the strictest compliance with fair trial guarantees enshrined in 
national and international law," the human rights organization said, adding that, 
"he was sentenced to death at the conclusion of a trial that violated both national 
law and international standards for fair trials".</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Amnesty International is 
deeply concerned that Turkey may resume executions after a 15 years' de facto 
moratorium. The organization calls on the Turkish authorities not to execute Abdullah 
Öcalan or any other person under sentence of death and reiterates its appeal for 
total abolition of the death penalty in Turkey. Amnesty International is unconditionally 
opposed to the death penalty in all cases without exception.</font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Fair trial concerns begin 
from the moment of arrest and encompass the preliminary investigation, the trial, 
all appeals and the imposition of the sentence," Amnesty International said.</font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Violations of Abdullah 
Öcalan's right to a fair trial include:</B> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Failure to allow prompt 
access to a judge: Abdullah Öcalan was brought before a judge only on the seventh 
day after his arrest. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that detaining 
a person for four days and six hours violates the right to be brought promtly 
before a judge. </font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Violations of the right 
to defend oneself in person or through legal counsel:</B><BR>
-Failure to allow prompt access to a lawyer: Abdullah Öcalan's first meeting with 
his lawyers did not take place until 10 days after his arrest. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -Failure to allow adequate 
time to communicate with his counsel: the meetings with his counsel were restricted 
to two hours a week at the most throughout the investigation period and the trial. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -Violation of his right 
to confidential communication with his counsel: during the meetings with his lawyers 
in the first two months, guards were present and not only within sight, but also 
within hearing distance. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -Failure to allow adequate 
time and facilities to prepare his defence and failure to inform him promptly 
of the charges against him: his lawyers received the written indictment two days 
after parts of it were read out at a press conference and the indictment distributed 
to the press. They were not allowed to bring any written or printed material to 
the meetings with their client. The lawyers' request to adjourn the trial to allow 
them more time to prepare the defence was rejected by the court. </font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Failure to provide a 
full trial before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal:</B><BR>
-Abduallh Öcalan was tried by a State Security Court (SSC).The fact that a military 
judge made rulings in the Öcalan trial until it was adjourned on 8 June for the 
preparation of the final defence undermines his right to a full trial before a 
competent, independent and impartial tribunal. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -When the trial of Abdullah 
Öcalan continued on 23 June, the military judge had been replaced by a civilian 
judge who had not actively participated in the trial from the beginning. Amnesty 
International believes that it is a fundamental principle of fairness that if 
there is a change of judges, the trial should be repeated from the beginning. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -The substitute civilian 
judge had issued the arrest warrant against which the defence lawyers appealed. 
Amnesty International, therefore, believes that he should not have participated 
in the final decision. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Amnesty International considers 
that the conditions of detention in which Abdullah Öcalan was held amounted to 
solitary confinement and as such may have constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. In violation of his right to be presumed innocent until convicted, 
he was presented to the public as guilty from the very beginning. His lawyers 
were repeatedly harassed and threatened both by government authorities and by 
angry crowds being left without protection by the security forces. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The last executions in 
Turkey took place in October 1984 and provoked an international outcry. Hidir 
Aslan, aged 28, was executed on 25 October 1984 after being convicted of belonging 
to an illegal organization in Izmir. He was however not convicted of killings. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since then, death sentences 
have continued to be imposed. But there has been a de facto moratorium on executions, 
as the Turkish parliament did not vote on any death sentences brought before it 
for approval. Amnesty International welcomes the moratorium. </font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The death penalty is the 
ultimate form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. It has never been shown 
to prevent crime - least of all politically-motivated crime - more effectively 
than other punishments," Amnesty International said.</font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B> Background</B><BR>
Turkey, a member of the Council of Europe and party to the European Convention 
of Human Rights, is one of the few remaining European states not to have abolished 
the death penalty. The resumption of executions in Turkey would be a severe setback 
for total abolition in western Europe, of which Turkey considers itself a part. 
It would be a bad example for eastern European countries considering abolition, 
and a blow for human rights in Turkey. Amnesty International urges the Turkish 
authorities to realize previous plans to abolish the death penalty.</font>
