    crucial information about a key prosecution witness in the trial of Geronimo ji Jaga
    (Pratt) -- a former leader of the Black Panther Party released last year on bail after
    serving 27 years for murder -- should result in the reversal of his conviction and finally
    put an end to 27 years of injustice, Amnesty International declared today. <p>Geronimo ji
    Jaga was released on bail on 10 June 1997, however, the Los Angeles (LA) District Attorney
    has appealed against the court's decision to overturn his original conviction. Amnesty
    International will be filing an amicus curaie brief on 1 July -- challenging the district
    attorney's appeal against a lower court ruling which ordered that Geronimo should have a
    new trial in view of the evidence about irregular conduct by the prosecuting authorities. </p>
    <p>&quot;For years we have maintained that the misconduct of law enforcement agencies in
    the investigation and prosecution of Geronimo may have jeopardized his right to a fair
    trial,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;And now evidence has emerged which would
    have made it impossible for a jury to convict him of murder in the first place.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Geronimo ji Jaga has already spent 27 years in jail. It is time that this man
    receives a fair new trial or have the charges against him dropped altogether.&quot; </p>
    <p>In its amicus briefing to the California Court of Appeal, Amnesty International will be
    raising the state's failure to disclose the fact that at the time of Geronimo's trial, his
    chief accuser, Julio Butler, was an informer for law enforcement agencies including the LA
    Police Department, LA District Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
    FBI. This failure to disclose this information ensured the defence's inability to
    discredit the testimony of Butler. In addition, the other evidence linking Geronimo to the
    murder was identification evidence from two witnesses that was inherently unreliable. </p>
    <p>&quot;The state's failure to disclose Julio Butler's role as informer led to the state
    presenting false testimony before the jury which undermines confidence in the
    verdict&quot; Amnesty International said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Geronimo should have been provided with a reasonable opportunity to present his
    case in conditions that did not place him at a disadvantage,&quot; the organization said.
    &quot;This new evidence clearly supports his allegation that he was framed by the FBI and
    the LA Police Department as part of a program to destabilize black political
    organizations.&quot; </p>
    <p>Amnesty International will be requesting the California Court of Appeal to affirm the
    lower court's ruling to grant Geronimo a new trial. </p>
    <p><b>Background</b><br>
    Geronimo ji Jaga was convicted in a Los Angeles state court in 1972 of shooting and
    killing a woman and wounding her husband during a robbery in Santa Monica in 1968. He has
    always denied involvement in the crime and maintained that he was 400 miles away at a
    Black Panther Party, BPP meeting in Oakland at the time of the murder. In 1975, US Senate
    hearings revealed that the BPP was a primary target of COINTELPRO, an FBI
    counter-intelligence program aimed at disrupting and neutralizing certain US political
    groups. Information obtained by Geronimo's lawyers from FBI files after 1979 revealed that
    he was personally targeted for &quot;neutralization&quot; under COINTELPRO at the time of
    his arrest. </p>
    <p>Information from FBI files also indicated that Julius Butler, the chief prosecution
    witness who testified that Geronimo had confessed to the murder, was a FBI informant for
    more than two years before the trial. Butler had denied ever being a police informant when
    on the witness stand. It was also alleged that information about a possible second suspect
    had been withheld and that the FBI had suppressed its own surveillance evidence which
    might have exonerated Geronimo. </p>
    <p>Geronimo ji Jaga had lodged a number of unsuccessful appeals against his conviction
    over the years. In 1996 the defence was finally granted an evidentiary hearing based on
    new evidence which, crucially, included information showing that Julius Butler was listed
    as a confidential informant in the state prosecutor's files at the time of Geronimo's
    trial. </p>
    <p>Amnesty International first called for a full federal inquiry into Geronimo's case in a
    report published in October 1981. The organization also called on the Governor of
    California to conduct an inquiry into the case in 1988. In March 1997, Amnesty
    International sent an observer to the court hearing for a new trial which took place in
    Orange County. </p>
