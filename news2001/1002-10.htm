- October 2 - &#147;Resistance against oppressive US foreign policy and the 
School of Assassins is a necessity, not a crime!&#148;  This was the presiding tone 
among the more than 50 supporters who held vigil outside the Philadelphia 
courthouse this morning as the five SOA Watch activists went on trial for 
peacefully protesting the School of the Americas (SOA), located at Ft. Benning, 
GA.  Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, from Detroit, Michigan, offered eloquent 
testimony about the atrocities committed by graduates of the SOA.  Represented 
by former Pennsylvania Attorney General Shane Creamer (who took the case pro 
bono) and Public Defender Shawn Nolan, the activists were acquitted on all 
charges (disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, obstructing justice, obstructing 
a highway, and conspiracy to obstruct a highway).   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the Republican National Convention (July 31, 2000), the five enacted a 
massacre carried out by SOA graduates, presided over by Uncle Sam.  Defendant 
Laurel Paget-Seekins stated, &#147;We put the SOA on trial today and the verdict 
shows that the real crime is the training of soldiers to repress their own 
people.  We will continue to nonviolently act to close this school of terror 
until it is shut down for good.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growing public outcry over the SOA and the exposure of the atrocities 
perpetrated by its graduates has moved Congress to action.  Legislation to 
close the school gradually gained bipartisan support, forcing the Pentagon to 
rename the SOA: the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, in 
January 2001. The Defense Department&#146;s intent was to disassociate the school 
from its murderous past, but the citizens&#146; movement and Congress were not 
fooled.   On May 10, 2001, a bipartisan bill was introduced in the House (HR 
1810) to close the SOA and investigate the relationship between the training 
and the countless human rights abuses perpetrated by graduates of the school. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During its 55-year history, the SOA has trained over 60,000 Latin American 
soldiers. It continues to train hundreds of soldiers yearly in combat skills 
such as commando tactics, mine warfare, military intelligence and psychological 
operations. SOA-trained troops return home to wage war against their own 
civilian population. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been 
tortured, raped, assassinated, &quot;disappeared,&quot; massacred and forced into refugee 
camps by those trained at the SOA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the course of a decade, 75 SOA opponents have spent over 40 years 
collectively in federal prisons for nonviolent acts of civil resistance to SOA 
violence.  The &#147;SOA Philly 5&#148; commit themselves to working in solidarity with 
the 24 nonviolent resisters who are currently in federal prisons by continuing 
their witness to close this school of torture.   </font></p>

&#147;SOA Philly 5&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These human rights activists were arrested while acting out a massacre 
committed by graduates of the School of the Americas (SOA), commonly referred 
to as the &#147;School of Assassins.&#148;  For years the training at the SOA included 
manuals advocating the use of torture, kidnappings and executions.  The street 
theater was a creative attempt to bring the reality of the violence being waged 
against the poor and indigenous communities throughout Latin America to the 
streets of Philadelphia.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ally Styan, 18, is a recent high school graduate from Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania and is currently working in the national office of SOA Watch.  
Ally has traveled to Nicaragua and Chiapas, Mexico to look at the effects of US 
foreign policy on the people of Latin America. These experiences led Ally to 
organize the Youth Coalition for Human Rights, a social justice group at her 
high school.  Since the RNC, Ally has continued in her work to bring justice 
and peace to the people of the Global South.  She has continued to put her body 
on the line in acts of civil disobedience to call attention to the violence of 
the SOA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laurel Paget-Seekins, 21, grew up in Philo, California.  She graduated with 
honors from Oberlin College with a degree in mathematics and liberation 
struggles studies.  Laurel has been working to close the School of the Americas 
for four years, co-coordinating an active student SOAW chapter in Oberlin, 
Ohio.  She has traveled to Ft. Benning, Georgia, six times to protest the SOA.  
Last January, she was part of a 31-day fast and vigil at the gates to Ft. 
Benning.  Laurel is dedicated to nonviolence and to acting to create a more 
just world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rebecca Johnson, 22, a recent graduate of Oberlin College and a social justice 
activist, has spent nearly four years organizing to close the school of 
assassins.  In January 2001 she organized a 31-day fast and vigil at the gates 
of Ft. Benning to draw attention to the reopening of the school under a 
different name.  As a woman of nonviolence, Becky hopes to denounce terrorism 
in this trial, especially terrorism funded by the US government in Latin 
America.  As she mourns in the wake of the September 11 tragedy, she asks, &#147;Are 
our hands clean?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Brown, 32, lives and works in Philadelphia.  Bill has been involved with 
the human rights movement in the Philadelphia area for several years spending 
the last three focusing on the School of the Americas.  Bill has been to Ft. 
Benning three times, crossing the line twice, most recently acting as a 
peacekeeper.  Bill completed a 14-day fast in April 2000 to draw attention to 
the crimes of the SOA.  Bill has lobbied for the closure of the school, helping 
to hold our public officials accountable for how our tax dollars are spent.  
Bill was part of an SOA Watch affinity group that ventured to Quebec this past 
spring to protest the FTAA.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Linda Panetta, 35, from Medford, NJ, is founder of SOA Watch/NE.  She has been working extensively on Latin American issues for the past 15 years.  She lived 
and worked in Guatemala and Nicaragua in the late 1980&#146;s, and in Oaxaca, Mexico 
in the mid-90&#146;s. She recently returned from Colombia, and continues to travel 
to Latin America working on human rights issues.  Linda is the producer and 
director of the award winning documentary &#147;School of the Americas: An Insider 
Speaks Out!&#148; (over 6,000 copies sold), and author of the book &#147;Solidarity in 
Action.&#148;  She does extensive lecturing, and has directed the effort with Bishop 
Gumbleton, which to date has resulted in a resolution signed by over 300 
bishops calling for the closure of the SOA.  Linda is a freelance photographer 
documenting, among other things, the realities in Latin America.</font></p>
