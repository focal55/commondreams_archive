- July 3 - The Brady Center to Prevent Gun 
            Violence and Common Cause today filed an ethics complaint against 
            Attorney General John D. Ashcroft, asserting that the Attorney General 
            violated his ethical obligations to his client, the United States, 
            by sending a letter to the National Rifle Association (NRA) that impermissibly 
            undermines the official U.S. legal position in pending litigation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Specifically, Ashcroft outlined his interpretation of the Second Amendment 
            in a May 17 letter to the NRA, an amicus party to the United States 
            v. Emerson, a pending lawsuit regarding the Second Amendment. In the 
            letter, which was printed on official letterhead from the U.S. Department 
            of Justice, Attorney General Ashcroft unequivocally contradicts the 
            United States position in this case - despite vowing, during his Senate 
            confirmation hearings, to put aside his personal views and uphold 
            the nation's gun laws. <br>
            <br>
            "We believe that Attorney General Ashcroft has blatantly violated 
            numerous ethical guidelines that govern his conduct toward his client, 
            the United States of America, said Michael D. Barnes, President of 
            the Brady Center. "Not only did he mislead the Senate and the American 
            people during his confirmation hearings by vowing to defend the nation's 
            gun laws, Mr. Ashcroft has publicly stated he supports the fundamental 
            legal position of the defendant in a case that the United States is 
            prosecuting. If the Attorney General had written a similar letter 
            to the defendant's attorneys in the case, there would be no question 
            as to the letter's impropriety. That the letter was sent to an amicus 
            party supporting the defendant makes his statements no less objectionable." 
            <br>
            <br>
            The Brady Center and Common Cause filed the ethics complaint today, 
            asking the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice, the 
            D.C. Court of Appeals' Board on Professional Responsibility, and the 
            White House Counsel to investigate Ashcroft. <br>
            <br>
            Scott Harshbarger, President of Common Cause, said: "With the Emerson 
            case now pending before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, anything 
            that the Attorney General says with respect to the Second Amendment 
            is of more than passing interest. What's at stake here is the integrity 
            of the U.S. Department of Justice. If the Attorney General believes 
            that the Justice Department should change its long-held position on 
            the Second Amendment, the proper place to address that issue is in 
            the federal courts, not in a letter to the NRA." <br>
            <br>
            The Brady Center and Common Cause also submitted a concurring opinion 
            letter from Professor Samuel Dash of Georgetown University Law Center, 
            who was ethics adviser to former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
            Dash wrote that Ashcroft "violated a number of the governing Rules 
            of Professional Conduct" by writing to the NRA, and that these violations 
            were of an "egregious nature." <br>
            <br>
            "Attorney General Ashcroft now, in an extrajudicial communication, 
            has advocated a legal position challenging the constitutionality of 
            that statute, and in effect, supported the dismissal of the indictment 
            in the Emerson case," Dash wrote. "This act of disloyalty to his client, 
            the United States, constitutes an impermissible conflict of interest." 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Background: </b><br>
            In a May 17, 2001 letter to James J. Baker of the National Rifle Association, 
            sent on the eve of the NRA Convention, Ashcroft presented a strongly 
            worded argument in favor of the view that the Second Amendment to 
            the Constitution guarantees an individual right to be armed. Ashcroft's 
            letter directly contradicts the arguments made in a legal brief filed 
            by the Department in United States v. Emerson, an ongoing case in 
            which the Department is defending the indictment of a Texas doctor 
            for gun possession while under a domestic restraining order. Dr. Emerson 
            had brandished a gun in front of his estranged wife and young child. 
            In its legal brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 
            the Department of Justice argued that Emerson's indictment did not 
            violate the Second Amendment because the Amendment guarantees only 
            the rights of citizens to be armed as part of an organized state militia, 
            a view adopted in 1939 by the United States Supreme Court and by every 
            federal appeals court. The NRA has filed an amicus brief in support 
            of the criminal defendant, Dr. Emerson, and against the United States 
            in Emerson. <br>
            <br>
            The Second Amendment reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary 
            to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and 
            bear Arms, shall not be infringed." In a 1999 legal brief filed in 
            U.S. v. Emerson, a constitutional challenge against the federal statute 
            barring gun possession by persons under domestic violence restraining 
            orders, the Justice Department stated: "…a 'reasonable relationship' 
            between the possession or use of a firearm and preservation or efficiency 
            of a well regulated militia must be demonstrated before a person can 
            invoke any Second Amendment protections." <br>
            <br>
            Ashcroft's letter to the NRA contradicts this view. In his May 17 
            letter he wrote: "While some have argued that the Second Amendment 
            guarantees only a 'collective' right of the States to maintain militias, 
            I believe the amendment's plain meaning and original intent prove 
            otherwise." <br>
            <br>
            During Ashcroft's confirmation hearings in January, several members 
            of the Senate Judiciary Committee raised concerns about whether Ashcroft's 
            personal and political views would conflict with the Attorney General's 
            duty to defend the laws of the United States of America with which 
            he personally disagrees. During vigorous questioning from several 
            Senators, Ashcroft assured them that he would put aside his personal 
            beliefs and uphold the nation's gun laws. When asked specifically 
            about how he would approach the Emerson case and other legal attacks 
            on federal firearms laws and regulations, Attorney General Ashcroft 
            responded: "I believe these are all enactments of the Congress signed 
            by the president, laws of the United States that are under attack. 
            I would expect to defend those vigorously." <br>
            <br>
            "It is hardly a 'vigorous defense' to make public statements and advance 
            legal arguments that undercut the arguments made by the Department 
            of Justice in support of the constitutionality of the statute," Barnes 
            said. "Further, communicating his personal view to an adverse party 
            in litigation is a clear violation of fundamental legal ethics."
