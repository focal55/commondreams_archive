- January 26 - On Tuesday, January 30, a full-page People For the American
Way ad in newspapers across the country will pose the question
to the American people that their U.S. Senators will be required
to answer during the coming days:
<p>"Should a man who misrepresents the facts under oath be our
Attorney General?"
<p>The ad details and documents four of the areas in which John
Ashcroft misrepresented or evaded the facts of his own record in
sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It
includes:
<p>-- his bitter battle against voluntary school desegregation
in St. Louis;
-- his advocacy, while he was Missouri's Attorney General and
responsible for upholding the law, of federal legislation to
enable states to end women's right to choose abortion;
-- his unfair and mean-spirited campaign of distortions
against a federal court nominee, Judge Ronnie White; and
-- his campaign against the confirmation of James Hormel, a
highly qualified gay man nominated to be U.S. Ambassador to
Luxembourg.
<p>"John Ashcroft used his testimony to mislead the Senators
through evasions, denials, and outright contradictions of the
documented public record of his own actions and statements,"
said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way.
"The question that the Senators must answer is whether a nominee
who so distorts and evades the facts under oath should be
entrusted with the responsibility of upholding our nation's
civil and constitutional rights."
<p>The ad encourages readers to contact their Senators by
calling their offices or signing an online petition at PFAW's
dedicated website: www.OpposeAshcroft.com. On Tuesday, PFAW
delivered over 130,000 petitions from all 50 states to the
Senate and is planning to deliver the second installment next
week, as tens of thousands of petitions continue to pour in.
<p>The ad is scheduled to appear on January 30 in 11 newspapers:
The New York Times, USA Today, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel,
The (Fargo, ND) Forum, the Bismarck (ND) Tribune, the (Sioux
Falls, SD) Argus Leader, the Rapid City (SD) Journal, the Bangor
(ME) Daily News; the Portland (ME) Press Herald, the (New
Orleans) Times Picayune, and the Hartford Courant. It will also
appear in the Thursday, February 1 edition of the twice-weekly
Washington, DC paper, Roll Call. Full text of the ad is attached
and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.OpposeAshcroft.com.">http://www.OpposeAshcroft.com.</a>

Text of Ashcroft ad:
<p>SHOULD A MAN WHO MISREPRESENTS THE FACTS UNDER OATH BE OUR
ATTORNEY GENERAL?
<p>John Ashcroft wants to be U.S. Attorney General, the highest
law enforcement officer in the land.
<p>But Ashcroft used his sworn testimony before the Judiciary
Committee to mislead the Senators. In some cases, he made
statements that are directly contradicted by the facts of his
record. In others, he used denial or evasion to try to distance
himself from extreme actions and statements from his past in an
apparent effort to reinvent himself as dedicated only to
upholding the law, rather than to any ideological agenda.
<p>What Ashcroft says and what Ashcroft's record shows:
<p>Under oath, Ashcroft said he followed the law and obeyed the
courts' orders as Missouri's Attorney General. Transcript of
Ashcroft Senate Confirmation Hearings
<p>But during his bitter 10-year legal battle against voluntary
school desegregation in St. Louis, a federal court sharply
criticized his "continual delay and failure to comply" with
court orders and concluded that "the state has, as a matter of
deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of the court."
Associated Press, St. Louis Post-Dispatch
<p>Under oath, he said he understood that an Attorney General's
role is not to make the laws but to enforce them and implied
that he would not use his power as Attorney General to try to
take away women's constitutional right to make their own
reproductive decisions. Transcript of confirmation hearings
<p>But as Missouri's Attorney General, Ashcroft did not hesitate
to push to severely limit that right. In fact, he even testified
before Congress to argue for federal legislation that would have
had the effect of overturning Roe v. Wade. As a U.S. Senator he
sought an abortion ban so sweeping that it would force rape
victims to bear their attacker's child and could outlaw birth
control pills and IUDs. John Ashcroft now wants the Senators to
believe he is ready to put aside these views in favor of
enforcing Roe v. Wade and other abortion rulings and laws.
Hearings Before Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on S.158 ("Human
Life Bill"); St. Louis Post-Dispatch; S.J. Res. 49 ("Human Life
Amendment"); S. 2135 ("Human Life Act");
<a href="http://www.all.org/activism/pb_basic.htm">http://www.all.org/activism/pb_basic.htm</a>;
Human Events
<p>Under oath, Ashcroft testified about his efforts to defeat
the federal court nomination of Judge Ronnie White, the first
African American to serve as a Missouri Supreme Court Judge.
Ashcroft admitted that he had called White's record
"pro-criminal" but said he "did not derogate his background."
Transcript of confirmation hearings
<p>But the record of Ashcroft's mean-spirited campaign of
distortions against White includes his charge that White would
"use his lifetime appointment to push law in a pro-criminal
direction, consistent with his own personal political agenda."
Congressional Record
<p>Under oath, he said he has not discriminated against gays and
did not block James Hormel's confirmation as Ambassador to
Luxembourg because Hormel is gay. Transcript of confirmation
hearings
<p>But while Ashcroft was waging his campaign against Hormel's
confirmation, he was quoted as objecting to Hormel for
"promoting a lifestyle" that he said could be "offensive" to
people in Luxembourg. News reports show that it was widely
acknowledged, even by Republicans, that the opposition to
Hormel's confirmation was based on his sexual orientation.
Boston Globe; San Diego Union Tribune
<p>John Ashcroft says we can trust him to uphold our fundamental
constitutional and civil rights. But with all he's done -- and
all that's at stake -- how can we?
