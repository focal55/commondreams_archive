- February 7 - Leading nongovernmental organizations
in the United States today sent a letter to European Union Development Commissioner
Poul Nielson, praising his suggestion that the European Union would make
up the shortfall in international family planning funding caused by
President George Bush's implementation of the "global gag rule."
However, the letter noted that this does not alleviate US
responsibility in this area.
<p>The groups also criticized the new policy -- which forbids any
foreign nongovernmental organization that accepts US family planning
funding from providing abortions with their own money or lobbying in
their own countries on abortion-related issues -- as a violation of
medical ethics, reproductive health rights and democratic principles.
<p>"Women, especially poor women, are in desperate need of the full
range of reproductive health services and the power to make
reproductive health decisions on the basis of full information and
access to safe and legal services....That United States international
family planning assistance would be conditioned on an NGO's agreement
to violate medical ethics by denying women access to the full range
of information about reproductive health services, including safe
abortion, as well as require that they absent themselves from the
public debate regarding national or international policy on abortion,
is an astonishing and unconscionable disregard for the most basic
principles of democracy and respect for international sovereignty,"
the letter reads.
<p>International public health experts estimate that as many as
600,000 women die each year from the complications of pregnancy and
childbirth, and that infant and child mortality could be decreased
25
percent by providing women with the resources to space their
pregnancies. The World Health Organization estimates that 80,000
women die annually from unsafe abortion.
<p>The full text of the letter follows:
<p>Feb. 7, 2001
<p>Mr. Poul Nielson<br>
Commissioner, Development
European Union
Humanitarian Aid Office
<br>
Rue de la Loi 200/Wetstraat 200
B-1049 <br>
Brussels
Belgium
<p>Dear Mr. Nielson:
<p>Your recent comments on President George Bush's reinstatement of
the "global gag rule" were a great boost for our morale. As United
States nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), we are gratified by your
support. While we are gratified that the European Union would move
to
fill the funding gap left by our president's callous disregard for
the plight faced by women throughout the world, this does not
alleviate the United States' responsibility in this area.
<p>Women, especially poor women, are in desperate need of the full
range of reproductive health services and the power to make
reproductive health decisions on the basis of full information and
access to safe and legal services. We are also embarrassed that
rights enshrined in the United States Constitution need to be
defended by those outside the country when our own government refuses
to honor them beyond its borders.
<p>That United States international family planning assistance would
be conditioned on an NGO's agreement to violate medical ethics by
denying women access to the full range of information about
reproductive health services, including safe abortion, as well as
require that they absent themselves from the public debate regarding
national or international policy on abortion, is an astonishing and
unconscionable disregard for the most basic principles of democracy
and respect for national sovereignty.
<p>The European Union and the donor countries of Europe have been in
the forefront of enlightened and respectful international
reproductive health policy. They have been quick to accept the
advances in thinking about population and development that place
women's empowerment and rights at the center of decision-making.
They have been especially supportive of the role NGOs in low- and
middle-income countries play in articulating values and policy as
well as providing services. NGOs are crucial partners in the effort
to prevent the spread of AIDS, to save women's lives by providing
much-needed reproductive health services, to inform policy through
research and monitoring of services and to partner with governments
in improving reproductive health law and policy.
<p>We wholeheartedly support your efforts to strengthen the work of
NGOs and United Nations' agencies in this field. Their work helps to
protect women around the world from unsafe abortions and takes
practical, concrete steps to reduce the need for abortion, while
lifting families from poverty, educating the young about HIV
prevention and providing crucial family planning services. We urge
you to follow through on your statement and work with European and
world leaders to replace any shortfall that results from President
Bush's actions.
<p>If there are any ways in which we can help you in your effort to
ensure that NGOs are able to do their work, do not hesitate to let
us
know. Rest assured that we will work unceasingly to overturn the
newly reenacted "global gag rule." Again our sincere thanks for your
courage and commitment to democracy, sound medical ethics and women's
health and rights.
