- January 2 - Mississippi Gay Lobby (MGL) will begin 
running television advertisements through cable 
advertising firms throughout the state.  The test run will 
begin in the Jackson metro area through Lovecomm 
Advertising Sales.  Customers who have Time-Warner 
Cable or Susquehanna (SusCom) Cable, which equals to 
approximately 95,200 cable subscribers, will be able to 
view the advertisements on MTV and VH-1.  After the 
test run, and providing expected results are met, a full 
Lovecomm systemwide run, including the addition of CNN 
and Lifetime to the channels the advertisement will be run 
on, will commence in the rest of the state for which 
Lovecomm handles cable advertising.  This full Lovecomm 
systemwide run will ultimately reach into 129,580 homes 
that subscribe to cable television.  In addition to the full 
Lovecomm systemwide run, other cable advertising 
systems in the state will be contacted and providing 
cooperation and acceptable negotiations, the 
advertisements will run on them as well, giving full 
statewide coverage and increasing the number of homes 
that the MGL advertisement will reach, to approximately 
650,000.

<p>"Indeed, this is a first in Mississippi.  For the Mississippi 
gay community and for a Mississippi gay equality 
organization, to be promoted on television within the 
state, is extraordinary progress.  Before we even 
imagined that this could possibly happen, and knowing 
the hostile environment against homosexuals in 
Mississippi, we first asked, out of respect, all of the 
companies involved in this undertaking as to whether or 
not they had a problem with us running advertisements.  
Lovecomm, the firm that is producing the spot and is 
responsible for its actual placement into rotation, as well 
as the cable companies who will be airing the spot, Time-
Warner and Susquehanna, all said they saw no problem.  
We of course applaud these companies for being open to 
progress and being a part of breaking down the 
homophobic barriers in Mississippi.," said MGL Chairman 
Jody Renaldo. "It has been a pleasure working with 
Lovecomm, to make this happen.  The initial meeting was 
a rather productive and fun one, as myself and Lovecomm 
executives not only discussed the actual television spot, 
but the gay community as well, from "gay slang" to the 
current state of affairs in the gay community.  Lovecomm 
executives have been very upfront with us about any 
issues that came about.  There was an instance where 
the ideas for the spot were given to a Lovecomm 
employee so that he could put together the script for the 
spot.  He refused to work on our project because of us 
being a gay organization.  We respect that and have no 
problems with it.  Not everyone is for us, and then again, 
not everyone is against us.  If everyone was for us, we 
wouldn't need to exist." 

<p>Renaldo said that the intent of the television 
advertisements, is to begin much needed education about 
the gay community, for Mississippi residents.  Renaldo 
also said the advertisements will promote the fact that an 
actual active gay equality organization does exist in 
Mississippi and will signify to the gay community in the 
state, that there is someone out there working for their 
equality.  "Almost a year into this organization, we have 
found that alot of gay and gay friendly Mississippians 
don't even know we exist.  This will get the word out, 
and in turn, our membership and lobbying power will go 
up.  2001 will be an exciting year for us and we hope that 
for whatever reasons, our community does not grow 
complacent and stale.  We have some serious battles 
ahead what with the outcome of the recent elections.  
The problem isn't Washington, nor Hollywood.  The 
problem is a weak, divided, complacent GLBT community 
and it is time for us to come together and make some 
noise and turn some heads.  The days of being who we 
are as long as noone else knows or sees it, should come 
to an end and we feel this is a great step in making that 
happen."

<p>Renaldo went on to say that the GLBT and GLBT friendly 
community of Mississippi, is encouraged to get involved in 
this project.  "This is not a cheap undertaking at all.  It's 
not as expensive as we thought it would be, but by no 
means is it cheap.  What we would like to see happen, is 
the spots run in our initial proposal which is 132 spots a 
month, 20 of those 132 spots to run at our discretion 
such as in cases of special programs that come on at 
particular times throughout the year on these channels.  
For us to do this, it will cost $3040.00 each month.  We 
could indeed use any underwriting, donations, grants, and 
memberships to fund this project.  We, of course, 
encourage the Mississippi GLBT and GLBT friendly 
community to stand up and help us make this happen.  
The advertisement will be available soon on our web site, 
for anyone to view."

<p><i>Mississippi Gay Lobby was formed in March of 2000. MGL 
exists to educate gay Mississippians about their 
community, its history, and about issues of relevance to 
them. The organization also exists to educate the general 
public about the Mississippi gay community. Beyond this, 
Mississippi Gay Lobby works to advance the cause of full 
equality and civil rights for all members of the Mississippi 
gay community. MGL operates a web site at
