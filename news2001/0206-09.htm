- February 6 -  When the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) announced
its 2001 Grammy Award nominations on January 3, many feminists were angry
but not terribly shocked. Rapper Eminem, infamous for his menacing lyrics,
is up for four Grammy Awards this year, including Album of the Year. Eminem
has become one of the hottest musicians today, with many young fans and
mainstream music outlets and critics embracing him. And now the Grammys
have invited Eminem to perform at the February 21 ceremonies to be telecast
live on CBS.
<p>National NOW President Patricia
Ireland will join activists from the Gay
&amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), California
NOW and other organizations outside the Los Angeles event to protest
the hate and violence that NARAS legitimizes by honoring Eminem.
<p>Women's rights advocates and lesbian and gay groups have been speaking
out against Eminem's violent songs for over a year now. NOW Executive Vice
President Kim Gandy appeared in an
MTV special on hate, where she addressed the dangerous implications of
Eminem's lyrics. MTV itself has attempted to retreat from the key role
it played in making Eminem a star, and even devoted 17 hours recently to
the stories of hate crime victims. But the music channel is still the main
place to watch Eminem videos and a dependable peddler of the exploitation
of women.
<p>Those in the music industry deflect charges that Eminem promotes violence
by talking about the artistry of the production and the complexity of his
musical arrangements. Most critics who put his album on their top ten lists
for 2000 admit that his lyrics are offensive and inflammatory, but bow
to its popular influence and driving beats. His supporters say Eminem's
just joking, or he's reflecting a culture that's already warped.&nbsp;
They say he's started a dialogue about hate. But feminists know that dialogue
started a long time ago and Eminem hasn't added anything new to the discussion–he's
just proved how far a musician can go and still reap the rewards of fame,
money and accolades.
<p>Eminem's music contains some of the most explicit descriptions of violence
ever to make their way into people's homes. In addition to consistently
calling women bitches, sluts and whores, Eminem sings about killing his
wife and raping his mother. He strikes out at everyone, including his fans,
but has a particular bloodlust for women, lesbians and gays.
<p>Is it possible for music fans to listen to a recording and hear only
the rhythm, not the words and their meanings? And what does that say about
the state of music? Or, do most of his fans hear the words, but are not
bothered by them? And what does that say about our culture?
<p>Here's a sample of Eminem's lyrics, all of which appear on his Grammy-nominated
album, words which fans and critics either don't hear or don't take offense
to:
<p>* Put your hands down, b*tch, I ain't gon' shoot you
<br>I'ma pull YOU to this bullet and put it through you
<br>(from Kill You)
<p>* Don't you get it b*tch, no one can hear you?
<br>Now shut the f*ck up and get what's comin to you
<br>You were supposed to love me
<br>NOW BLEED! B*TCH BLEED!
<br>(from Kim)
<p>*&nbsp; My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
<br>That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or lez
<br>(from Criminal)
<p>* I make fight music for high school kids
<br>I put lives at risk when I drive like this
<br>I put wives at risk with a knife like this
<br>(from Who Knew)
<p>* B*tch, please - you must have a mental disease
<br>Assume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon
<br>(from B*tch Please II)
<p>Violence against women is a serious problem, one that women's rights
groups, shelters and survivors of male violence deal with every day. To
ignore Eminem's lyrics proves only how numb our society is becoming to
violence as entertainment. To treat his words as a joke communicates to
a large number of boys and young men that violence against a wife, girlfriend
or mother is something to laugh at.
<p>With Eminem's Grammy nominations viewed as a seal of approval, many
more people have stepped forward to voice their outrage. Young women, parents,
people of all political persuasions are writing to NOW, asking what they
can do. While Eminem continues to make lots of money for lots of people,
he will most likely be everywhere. But we can certainly shame those who
profit from and promote him and his music. If you're going to be in the
Los Angeles area on February 21, come to the protest outside the Staples
Center at 3:00 pm. If not, write to NARAS, 3402 Pico Boulevard, Santa Monica,
CA 90405 and tell them what you think about the members of the Recording
Academy giving a platform to hate and violence.
