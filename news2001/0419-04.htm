- April 19 - A ground-breaking new report by Human Rights 
Watch, No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons, charges that state 
authorities are responsible for widespread prisoner-on-prisoner sexual 
abuse in U.S. men's prisons. The 378-page report is based on more than 
three years of research and is the first national survey of 
prisoner-on-prisoner rape. There are some two million inmates in U.S. 
prisons and jails. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rape is in no way an inevitable consequence of incarceration,&quot; said     
                                         Joanne Mariner, deputy director 
of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, and author of the 
report. &quot;But it is a predictable one if prison and prosecutorial 
authorities do little to prevent and punish it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch warned that by failing to implement reasonable        
         measures to prevent and punish rape&#151;and, indeed, in many cases, 
taking actions that make sexual victimization likely&#151;state authorities 
permit this physically and psychologically devastating abuse to occur. 
The                  group's findings are based on correspondence with 
more than 200 prisoners spread among thirty-four states, inmate 
interviews, and a comprehensive survey of state correctional 
authorities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain prisoners are targeted for sexual exploitation the moment they 
enter a penal facility: their age, looks, sexual preference, and other 
characteristics mark them as candidates for abuse. Human Rights Watch's 
research revealed a broad range of factors that correlate with increased 
vulnerability to rape. These include youth, small size, and physical 
weakness; being white, gay, or a first offender; possessing &quot;feminine&quot; 
characteristics such as long hair or a high voice; being unassertive, 
unaggressive, shy, intellectual, not street-smart, or &quot;passive&quot;; or 
having been convicted of a sexual offense against a minor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sexual Slavery
In the most extreme cases, Human Rights Watch found that prisoners 
unable to escape a situation of sexual abuse may find themselves the 
&quot;slaves&quot; of their rapists. Forced to satisfy another man's sexual 
appetites whenever he demands, they may also be responsible for washing 
his clothes, massaging his back, cooking his food, cleaning his cell, 
and a range of other chores. They are frequently &quot;rented out&quot; for sex, 
sold, or even auctioned off to other inmates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No conclusive national data exist regarding the prevalence of 
prisoner-on-prisoner rape in the United States. But the most recent 
statistical survey, published in the Prison Journal, showed that 21 
percent of inmates in seven Midwestern prisons had experienced at least 
one episode of pressured or forced sex since being incarcerated,         
        and at least 7 percent had been raped in their facility. And an 
internal departmental survey of corrections officers in one southern 
state found that line officers &#151; those charged with the direct 
supervision of inmates &#151; estimated that roughly one-fifth of all 
prisoners were being coerced into participation in inmate-on-inmate sex.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These rapes are unimaginably vicious and brutal,&quot; said Mariner. &quot;Gang 
assaults are not uncommon, and victims may be left beaten, bloody and, 
in the most extreme cases, dead.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most tragic and violent cases the report documents is that of 
Randy Payne, a twenty-three-year-old incarcerated in Texas. Within a 
week of entering prison, Payne was attacked by a group of some twenty 
inmates. The inmates demanded sex and money, but Payne refused. He was 
beaten for almost two hours, and died of head injuries a few days later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Victims of rape often suffer extreme psychological stress, a condition 
identified as &quot;rape trauma syndrome.&quot; Many inmate victims with whom 
Human Rights Watch has been in contact have reported nightmares, deep    
             depression, shame, loss of self-esteem, self-hatred, and 
considering or attempting suicide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Deliberate Indifference&quot;
Correctional authorities generally deny that prisoner-on-prisoner rape 
is a serious problem. Human Rights Watch surveyed correctional 
authorities in all 50 states on the prevalence of rape and sexual abuse. 
In that multi-year survey, not one state reported abuse rates even 
faintly approaching those found by academic researchers. For example, 
New Mexico prison officials said, regarding &quot;the &#145;problem' of male 
inmate-on-inmate rape and sexual abuse&quot; (internal quotation marks are 
theirs), that they had &quot;no recorded incidents over the past few years.&quot; 
Nearly half of all states do not even compile separate statistics on 
sexual assault.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authorities' reluctance to acknowledge the problem of 
prisoner-on-prisoner rape is reflected not only in misleading official 
statistics, but also in a glaringly inadequate response to incidents of 
rape. &quot;U.S. state prisons have failed to take even obvious, basic steps 
necessary to tackle prison rape,&quot; Mariner said. &quot;This deliberate 
indifference has had tragic consequences.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A central problem is the deficient &#151; and, in many instances, callous and 
irresponsible &#151; response of correctional staff to complaints of rape. 
When an inmate informs an officer he has been threatened with rape or, 
worse, actually assaulted, it is crucial that his complaint be 
investigated and that he be protected from further abuse. Yet Human 
Rights Watch found that correctional staff frequently ignore or even 
react hostilely to inmates' complaints of rape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Another important contributing factor to the prison rape crisis is the 
failure of the criminal justice system to address these crimes,&quot; said 
Mariner. &quot;Perpetrators of prison rape rarely face criminal charges, even 
when rape is accompanied by extreme physical violence.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case of M.R., a Texas inmate, is illustrative. M.R. was violently 
raped and beaten several times over a period of several months by the 
same prisoner. Fearful for his life, he reported the abuse to the prison 
authorities, but found no protection. In fact one investigator dismissed 
the problem as a &quot;lovers' quarrel.&quot; Finally one day the rapist showed up 
in M.R.'s housing area and attacked M.R. again. The rapist hit M.R. so 
hard with a combination lock that when M.R. regained consciousness he 
could read the word &quot;Master&quot; &#151; the lockmaker                 &#151; on his 
forehead. In all, during the rape, M.R. suffered a broken neck, jaw, 
left collarbone, and finger; a dislocated left shoulder; two major 
concussions, and lacerations to his scalp that caused bleeding on the 
brain. Notwithstanding the extreme violence of the attack, and despite 
M.R.'s best efforts to press charges, the rapist                 was 
never criminally prosecuted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another devastating consequence of prisoner-on-prisoner rape discussed 
in the report is the transmission of the HIV virus. Several prisoners 
with whom Human Rights Watch is in contact believe that they have 
contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, through forced sexual 
intercourse in prison.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book-length Human Rights Watch report explains:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; why and how prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse occurs; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; who commits it and who falls victim to it;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; prison rape's long-term effects, both physical and psychological;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; how are prison authorities coping with it; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; what reforms must be instituted to better prevent rape from   
occurring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Prison rape is part of the mythology of prison life. But in reality, it 
is devastating human rights abuse that can and should be prevented,&quot; 
said Mariner. The report includes extensive recommendations to federal 
and state authorities, urging them to step up their efforts to address 
this gross violation of human dignity. </font></p>
