- February 22 - A landmark report issued
today by three nuclear watchdog groups and the nation's largest
animal protection organization charges that the nuclear power
industry, contrary to its environmentally friendly public relations
image, has knowingly destroyed animals and delicate marine
ecosystems, and has routinely killed endangered species over the
past three decades due to the widespread use of an ecologically
harmful cooling technology.
<p>The report, "Licensed to Kill: How the Nuclear Power Industry
Destroys Endangered Marine Wildlife and Ocean Habitat to Save
Money," further documents a lack of oversight by governmental
regulatory agencies, particularly the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), that may border on collusion.
<p>"Tragically, under the present regulatory system, the nuclear
power industry's needs almost always prevail over the interests of
marine life," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe
Energy Communication Council (SECC).
<p>"Instead of applying sanctions when a nuclear plant kills more
than its allotted quota of endangered species, NRC almost always
supports industry attempts to raise the limits on the number of
animals that can be killed or captured during reactor operation,"
Denman added.
<p>The Safe Energy Communication Council, Nuclear Information and
Resource Service (NIRS), Standing for Truth about Radiation (STAR),
and The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), are the four
groups issuing "Licensed to Kill."
<p>"The nuclear power industry is essentially licensed to kill by
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accommodate company profit
margins. Regulators are constantly pressured by the nuclear
industry to stretch the rules and not enforce such laws as the
Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act," said Michael
Mariotte, NIRS executive director.
<p>The report documents the nuclear power industry's use of the
ecologically harmful, but relatively inexpensive once-through
cooling technology responsible for devastating marine ecosystems
from New England to California.
<p>Once-through cooling technology is used exclusively in 48
nuclear reactors with 11 additional reactors employing the
technology in conjunction with cooling towers and canals. These
reactors, situated on coastal waters, major rivers, and lakes can
draw in as much as a billion gallons of water per reactor unit a
day, nearly a million gallons a minute, in order to dissipate the
extraordinary amounts of waste heat generated in the fission
process.
<p>The initial devastation of marine life and ecosystems stems from
the powerful intake of water into the nuclear reactor. Marine
life, ranging from endangered sea turtles and manatees down to
delicate fish larvae and microscopic planktonic organisms vital to
the ocean ecosystem, is sucked irresistibly into the reactor
cooling system, a process known as entrainment. Some of these
animals are killed, either through impingement (animals are caught
and trapped against filters, grates, and other reactor structures),
or, in the case of air-breathing animals like turtles, seals, and
manatees, drown or suffocate.
<p>"Nuclear power stations are routinely allowed to destroy
alarming percentages of fish stocks and larvae entrained through
cooling water intakes," said Bob Alvarez, executive director of the
STAR Foundation, based on Long Island Sound. "In contrast, the
commercial fishing industry must submit to strict regulatory
standards including fines and license suspension for illegal
takes."
<p>The report notes that an equally huge volume of wastewater is
then discharged at temperatures up to 25 degrees F hotter than the
water into which it flows. Indigenous marine life suited to colder
temperatures is consequently eliminated or, in the case of endemic
fish, forced to move, disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.
<p>Moreover, the new, warmer ambient water temperatures often
encourage warm-water species to colonize the artificially
maintained warm-water zone. When the warm water flow is diminished
or halted because of maintenance, cleaning, or repair work on the
reactor, these species are often "cold-stunned;" many subsequently
die of hypothermia. Species affected include endangered sea
turtles, marine mammals, fish, and sea birds.
<p>In addition, the heated water is discharged with such force that
surrounding seabeds are often scoured to bare rock, leaving a
virtual marine desert bereft of life on the ocean floor.
<p>"Although responsible for enforcing compliance with intake and
discharge permits at reactors under the terms of the Clean Water
Act, the EPA has largely failed to establish national performance
standards," said Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Watchdog
Project at NIRS and a report author. "When faced with the
opportunity to enforce "best available technology" standards, the
EPA has buckled to industry pressure and left the marine
environment to pay the price."
<p>Similarly, state water and wildlife authorities fall prey to
nuclear industry pressure tactics and falsifications. In numerous
incidents, nuclear utilities have falsified data and concealed and
withheld information from environmental regulators that would have
revealed the true extent of the environmental damages wrought by
their reactor operations.
<p>In perhaps the most egregious example, the California utility,
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), for many years, provided state
water
authorities with skewed data that omitted known marine damage by
its Diablo Canyon reactors.
<p>PG&amp;E claimed that the plant's intake and discharge of billions
of gallons of seawater a day did little harm to the surrounding
marine community. In reality, the plant's operation had devastated
marine ecosystems for miles up and down the coast and was
responsible for the near obliteration of already threatened black
and red abalone populations in the area.
<p>Finally threatened with legal action by regulators, PG&amp;E
nevertheless managed to undermine the state's cease-and-desist
order by promising to outspend the authorities on legal appeals,
effectively tying up any lawsuit in litigation for years. State
authorities backed down from stopping the damaging thermal
discharge and agreed to a settlement that includes a cash amount of
just $4.5 million and other half-measures that will allow the PG&amp;E
and Diablo Canyon to continue its business-as-usual practices to
the detriment of the marine environment.
<p>"The nuclear industry plans to roll back environmental
protections to create a new bottom line," said Linda Gunter, SECC
Communications director, one of the report's authors. "The
industry cries poverty when asked to install less destructive
systems and again when told to mitigate the environmental damage,"
continued Gunter. "While nuclear utilities advertise themselves as
environmentally friendly, in reality they are sacrificing the
marine environment and its inhabitants on the altar of company
profits."
<p>The list of once-through nuclear reactors in the United States
includes the Diablo Canyon and San Onofre complexes in California,
which supply 20 percent of the total electricity to the strained
California power grid; Millstone in Waterford, CT; Crystal River
and the St. Lucie in Florida; Calvert Cliffs in Maryland; and
Seabrook in New Hampshire.
