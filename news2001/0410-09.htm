- April 10 -  Saying the White House budget plan would cripple vital
conservation efforts across the country, Rodger Schlickeisen,
president of Defenders of Wildlife, called the proposed budget
for conservation and environment "a blatant shell game that
breaks still more promises President Bush made on the campaign
trail." Schlickeisen noted severe cuts across the Department
of Interior budget and proposals in the budget to fund the widespread
opening of public lands to extractive industries.
<p>Schlickeisen noted dramatic cuts in the overall budgets for all
natural resource and environment programs. The president's budget
would slash the natural resources and environment budget function
by 7.3 percent compared to last year, and a full 11 percent below
the level needed to keep up with inflation. Within those programs,
Schlickeisen zeroed in on two major areas where the President's
budget fell well short of his campaign rhetoric: the proposed
budget's "bait and switch" on the Land and Water Conservation Fund
and the evisceration of scientific monitoring within the within the
Department of Interior.
<p>"Instead of the solid commitment to land and water conservation
he promised in the campaign, the president has delivered a cynical
budget sleight of hand," said Schlickeisen. "The gap between
rhetoric and reality is even bigger on funding for biology and
environmental science in this budget. Instead of supporting the
'sound science' that the president and Secretary Norton claim will
be at the heart of their environmental policy, this budget guts
science programs and amounts to a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy on
environmental science. Of course, they manage to find money for
survey work to run full speed ahead on opening our public lands to
all-out energy and mineral exploitation."
<p>Budget analysis by Defenders of Wildlife, a summary of which
follows this release, also pointed to significant shortfalls
between this budget proposal and support for private land owner
environmental initiatives within the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. The analysis highlights significant shortfalls in
funding for work the Endangered Species Act (ESA), as well as
language that would effectively prevent citizens and the courts
from holding the Department accountable under the Act.

<p><b><font size="3">Comments On Bush FY 2002 Proposed Budget For Natural Resources
And Environment
</font></b>
<p><b>1. Slashing Natural Resources and Environment Programs
</b>
<p>FY01 (enacted): $28.8 B
FY02 (request): $26.7 B
<p>The Bush Budget request slashes the overall amount for all
natural resources and environment programs by $2.1 B or 7.3 percent
for FY 2002. This is actually $2.3 B or an 11 percent cut below
the amount needed to maintain the current services level for FY
2002. For the five-year period from FY 2002 to FY 2006, the cut
totals $22 B or a crippling 13.8 percent cut below the current
services level. For appropriated programs under this category, the
cut for FY 2002 is $2.3 B below FY 2001, an 8 percent cut or 11.2
percent below current services. Over the five-year period the cut
totals $19.6 B or 12.5 percent below current services. With the
greatest budget surplus in the history of this country, the Bush
Budget is proposing severe reductions for programs that protect our
precious natural heritage and public health. These cuts would
likely be far worse in the future than projected at this point if
the proposed tax cut passes.
<p><b>2. Under Funding Department of the Interior
</b>
<p>FY01 (enacted): $10.2 B
FY02 (request): $9.8 B
<p>The Department of the Interior, which houses most of the natural
resources management agencies -- the Fish and Wildlife Service, the
National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S.
Geological Survey -- is being hit with a $400 M cut or 4 percent
for appropriated programs for FY 2002. This amounts to a 7 percent
cut below the level needed to maintain current services.
<p><b>3. Broken Promise on Land and Water Conservation Fund
</b>
<p>FY01 (enacted): $1.6 B
FY02 (request): $1.51 B
FY02 dedicated level: $1.76 B
<p>President Bush's budget gives a one-two punch here. He breaks
the historic conservation deal enacted last year and violates his
campaign promise to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation
Fund. In fact, the budget only requests $390 M for traditional
LWCF activities. While the President appears to be giving with one
hand, he is taking away with the other.
<p>One of the great bipartisan achievements of the 106th Congress
was establishment of a new dedicated land conservation trust fund,
called the Land, Conservation, Preservation and Infrastructure
Improvement (LCPII) fund, in last year's Interior appropriations
bill. The Interior bill set up this new fund as a separate
conservation budget category to be provided with separate dedicated
funding of $12 billion in dedicated funding over six years,
starting at $1.6 B for 2001 and increasing by $160 M per year to
reach $2.4 B in 2006. This funding is for popular -- but very
poorly funded -- programs that address loss of open space, wildlife
habitat, wildlands, cultural treasures, and recreational
opportunities to uncontrolled urban sprawl and development. LCPII
also provides badly needed support for critical coastal and marine
protection programs. Under last year's deal, the fund is slated to
receive $1.76 B for FY 2002. President Bush's budget request cuts
the fund by $250 M below its dedicated level of $1.76 B for FY
2002. Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) realized the President's
budget falls short in the LCPII fund; he added funding to reach the
full FY 2002 dedicated $1.76 B level to the Senate Budget
Resolution which had reflected the President's levels.
<p>The Bush budget also plays a shell game by diverting funding
from most of the programs under the LCPII agreement to make up the
total for his "increase" to the Land and Water Conservation Fund
(LWCF). To make up the total of $450 M for the state portion of
the Land and Water Conservation Fund, money is siphoned from
programs included in last year's bipartisan package that provide
funding to states for: conservation of wildlife, endangered
species, and wetlands; rehabilitation of urban parks; preservation
of historic treasures; and aid to states to assist in smart-growth
planning. States instead are given "flexibility" to use their
state LWCF funding for these needs. President Bush's request also
diverts $60 M in funding from the federal LWCF program to establish
two new grant programs to provide incentives to private landowners
for habitat conservation. While we support the concept of these two
new programs they ought not be funded at the expense of federal
LWCF when there is an estimated backlog of $10 billion in
acquisition needs in our national wildlife refuges, parks, forests
and BLM lands. If President Bush were really keeping his promise
to fully fund LWCF, he would be requesting an additional $300 M
instead of siphoning resources from other programs. If President
Bush were really keeping his promise to fully fund LWCF and
honoring the commitment made in the LCPII last year, he would be
requesting a total increase of $550 M for these programs. There is
no guarantee that any more than $390 M would be used for
traditional LWCF activities.
<p><b>4. Boosting Resource Exploitation
</b>
<p>FY01 BLM Energy&amp;Minerals (enacted): $76.7 M
FY02 BLM Energy&amp;Minerals (request): $91.5 M
<p>FY01 BLM Land Use Plans (enacted): $25.84 M
<p>FY02 BLM Land Use Plans (request): $33.03 M
<p>FY01 MMS OCS Lands (enacted): $117.9 M
FY02 MMS OCS Lands (request): $125.9 M
<p>While the Bush budget slashes funding for important conservation
programs, it would dramatically increase funds for energy and
mineral development on our public lands and off the Outer
Continental Shelf of the U.S. An increase of $15 M is included for
BLM to expand energy and mineral activities, including surveys of
oil and gas reserves on federal lands, funding for further
development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and to
initiate planning for energy development in the pristine Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. Despite the fact that both the House and
Senate budget resolutions have repudiated assumptions of receipts
for drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the Bush budget assumes a lease
sale in the Arctic Refuge for FY 2004 that will generate $2.4 B.
The Budget also includes an increase of $7.1 M for revision of BLM
land use plans. According to the Department of the Interior Budget
Blueprint, "seventeen of the new plan revisions are related to
energy and minerals development, including seven in Wyoming.
Finally, for the Minerals Management Service, a $14.7 M increase
for OCS lands would go to support increased oil and gas development
in the Gulf of Mexico, off the Outer Continental Shelf of the U.S.
<p><b>5. Cutting Endangered Species Funding
</b>
<p>FY01 (enacted): $225.64 M
FY02 (request): $166.49 M
<p>Despite Secretary Gale Norton's repeated assurances that this
administration will enforce the Endangered Species Act (ESA), this
budget would slash endangered species work by approximately $59
million, or more than 25 percent compared to this year. Because
the ESA is already severely underfunded, this cut would have
drastic impacts on many of our nation's critically imperiled
species. The nearly $6 million cut in the recovery program would
mean that species already listed under the ESA, like the Rio Grande
silvery minnow and Attwater's greater prairie chicken, would not
recover and potentially even go extinct. The proposed increase of
about $2 M in the listing program is welcome but not nearly enough
to address the substantial backlog of almost 300 species awaiting
listing and hundreds more awaiting critical habitat. Species
awaiting listing include ones like the Mississippi Gopher frog,
once abundant in the bayous of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama,
now found in only one breeding pond in Harrison County, Miss. and
threatened by a proposed housing development just 200 meters away.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated a $120 million need to
address the listing and critical habitat backlog, yet the Bush
Administration has only requested $8 million.
<p>To make matters worse, the Bush Administration is also
requesting a rider that would waive the statutory deadlines for
listing species and designating critical habitat under section 4 of
the ESA. For example, within 90 days of receiving a petition to
list a species as endangered or threatened, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS) must determine whether the petitioned action
is warranted. Moreover, within 12 months of receiving the
petition, FWS must decide whether it will propose the species for
listing. If any of these deadlines are missed, the ESA authorizes
citizens to enforce them in court, which is how most species are
now listed. The Bush Administration listing rider would
effectively eliminate the threat of citizen suits by waiving the
ESA's deadlines, and give the Administration absolute discretion to
decide whether and when a species is ever listed.
<p><b>6. Starving Environmental Science</b>
<p>FY01 (enacted): $883.4 M
FY02 (request): $813.9 B
<p>The budget cuts demanded for science programs within the U.S.
Geological Survey shows the president's and Secretary Norton's talk
of environmental enforcement based on "sound science" to be nothing
more than hollow, cynical rhetoric. Under the FY2002 budget, the
Bush Administration proposes to cut the FY2001 funding levels for
USGS by 7.9 percent. The budget not only reverses budget gains
last year, but would actually cut funding for some programs below
FY2000. Scientists at USGS provide critical information about
fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats, and they detect
trends in our environment over time. This research is vital to
detecting and responding to environmental problems -- Bush's
proposed budget for USGS amounts to a "don't ask, don't tell"
policy on the environment.
<p>The Biological Resources Division of USGS, which is essentially
the research arm for many federal land management agencies, would
be crippled by these cuts. For example, FY2001 was the first year
since 1994 that the Cooperative Research Units were fully funded
for all positions, and the FY2002 budget would fall short of full
funding again. The cuts largely eliminate the National Biological
Information Infrastructure, a program designed to allow researchers
to find ecological information easily through a centralized system.
Finally, the cuts will freeze progress for the Gap Analysis
Program, which has mapped the biological resources of 79 percent of
the states in the U.S.
<p>Outside of the Biological Resources Division, other programs at
USGS would suffer huge losses, including a $44 million decrease in
Water Resources Investigations. These cuts will eliminate the
National Water Quality Assessment Program and the Toxic Substances
Hydrology Research. Given the recent decision to reverse the
arsenic rule, eliminating Toxic Substances Hydrology Research,
which provides information on the behavior of toxic substances in
surface and groundwater, is particularly cynical.
<p><b>7. Ducking Promise on Landowner Incentives
</b>
<p>FY01 (enacted): $218 M
FY02 (request): $0
<p>While the proposed budget does provide funding for the
Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality
Incentives Program, it provides absolutely no funding for several
popular and effective USDA private landowner conservation incentive
programs. The funding levels above reflect those important
landowner incentive programs that have been zeroed out and are
discussed below.
<p>As a presidential candidate, George W. Bush recognized that
almost two-thirds of all land in the United States is privately
owned and that roughly 75 percent of endangered species reside on
private land. He spoke of the importance of the federal government
working with state and local governments and with private citizens
to protect our natural resources. That awareness, however, is not
reflected in the USDA budget President Bush unveiled yesterday.
<p>The budget provides absolutely no funding for the Wildlife
Habitat Incentives Program. Farmers participating in WHIP receive
some financial assistance for restoring and managing wildlife
habitat on their land. This program benefits threatened and
endangered species, as well as other species.
<p>The budget also cuts all funding for the Wetlands Reserve
Program (WRP), a program that improves water quality and protects
wildlife. This program is so popular that roughly three-fourths of
farmers and ranchers who apply to participate are turned away for
lack of funding.
<p>The Bush budget plan also eliminates FY 2002 funding for other
popular and effective voluntary conservation programs for
agricultural producers. These include the Farmland Protection
Program, Soil and Water Conservation Assistance, and the Forestry
Incentives Program.
