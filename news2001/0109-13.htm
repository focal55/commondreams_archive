- January 9 - <i>"Gale Norton would be a natural disaster as Interior Secretary."</i> -- Carl
Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director.
<p>
<p>
Gale Norton is an anti-environmental extremist whose record as a lobbyist
for polluters, an attorney for loggers and miners, and a protege of James
Watt makes her unfit to be Secretary of the Interior. Gale Norton favor allowing polluters to regulate themselves; as an attorney she sued the EPA
to overturn clean-air standards; and, in the Reagan administration, she worked to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

<p>
<p>
Due to her views and her record, the Sierra Club strongly opposes the
confirmation of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior.
<p>
<p><b>
Protecting Public Lands
</b>
<p>
<p>
Norton has long advocated opening America's wildlands to the oil, gas,
mining and logging industries. During the Reagan administration, Norton served as associate solicitor at the Interior Department, where she helped
support efforts to drill the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an
issue that will be hotly debated at the beginning of the 107th Congress.
<p>
<p>
Before working for the Reagan administration, Norton was hired by James Watt at the arch-conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation, which often
represents loggers, miners, ranchers and water developers in fights against
environmental safeguards.  Watt was later ousted as President Reagan's
Interior Secretary for his extremist agenda.
<p>
<p>
     As reported by the 1/7/2001 issue of the Sacramento Bee, an
     environmental lawyer who worked with Norton said: "I think that she
     [Norton] adheres to the same philosophies as James Watt, but she is
     infinitely more diplomatic in her presentations..."
<p>
<p>
Ms. Norton has consistently opposed Congressional designation of new
wilderness areas in Colorado if designation protect the water flowing
through the wilderness.  She would have Congress acknowledge the unique rock formations, rich and diverse vegetation, and healthy wildlife, then
allow developers to drain the water, the very substance that makes all
those features possible.
<p>
<p>
     She opposed Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993, and its earlier versions,
     because it included provisions that recognized the need for water in
     wilderness, even though that legal recognition did nothing to diminish
     any existing or future water right.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p><b>
Defending the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
</b>
<p>
<p>
Norton opposes protecting the last pristine portion of Alaska's North
Slope, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Instead Norton wants to open
the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling, which will destroy this fragile
habitat -- home to herds of caribou, polar bears and musk oxen -- and
threaten the native Gwich'in people who depend on these animals to live.
<p>
<p>
     As reported in the Washington Post (Dec. 29, 2000), Norton, at the press conference introducing her nomination, said: "President-elect
     Bush took a position... that we should explore opening the Arctic
     National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration... I cannot
     comment in terms of my own actions on that, but I do support the
     president in the positions that he has taken during his campaign."
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Protecting Endangered Species
</b>
<p>
<p>
Norton is opposed to federal environmental protections and is in favor, of
what she calls, "market-oriented, property rights-based, locally controlled
solutions." (as reported by abcNEWS.com).
<p>
<p>
     She has objected to the Endangered Species Act, advocating that
     landowners be paid by taxpayers to comply with the law.  She advocates
     such payments because they would have a "chilling effect" on wildlife
     protections.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>National Environmental Policy Act
</b>
<p>
<p>
Norton has also objected to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
which requires the government review the environmental harm of proposed federal projects to public lands and endangered species.
<p>
<p>
     Testifying on NEPA before Congress on March 18, 1998, Norton indicated
     her desire to revamp our nation's most over-arching environmental
     protection law.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Protecting Clean Air and Water
</b>
<p>
<p>
Norton opposes enforcing anti-pollution laws and instead supports a
"self-audit" system that has been criticized by the EPA because it lets polluters off the hook with secret settlements that allow the polluter to
avoid punishment.
<p>
<p>
     In 1993, Attorney General Norton failed to enforce the Clean Air Act
     against the Hayden coal-fired power plant in northern Colorado.  This
     facility's pollution was so severe that it was measurably increasing
     acid rain damage in Rocky Mountain National Park and Colorado
     wilderness areas.  Her failure to enforce the law came despite her statements that she prefer delegating enforcement authority to the states, as this power was.  Ultimately, a private lawsuit, a federal
     court action and the U.S. EPA got the act enforced, the private
     corporation operating the plant acknowledged their violations and
     settled with EPA, and the pollution was reduced. (Denver Post 1/7/01)

<p>
<p>
     Similarly, Ms. Norton failed to enforce federal or state law against
     operators of the Summitville Mine after a tailings pond there
     collapsed, sending high-acid pollution into natural streams, killing
     all life in them for thirty miles. (New York Times, 1/6/01)
<p>
<p>
     She did not take action against Louisiana-Pacific, operators of a wood
     products plant near Olathe, Colorado, despite evidence from a
     successful citizens' lawsuit showed that the plant was intentionally
     dumping illegal levels of air pollution at night.  Federal prosecutors
     had to step in, confirming 18 separate illegal dumping violations and
     exacting over $30 million in fines. (Denver Post 1/7/01)
<p>
<p>
     Ms. Norton also took no action against a petroleum company that
     spilled oil into Sand Creek near Denver.  A suit by the Sierra Club
     finally brought a $1 million penalty.
<p>
<p>
Norton is also a registered lobbyist for NL Industries of Houston. NL
Industries, formerly known as the National Lead Company, has been sued for
children's exposure to lead paint.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p><b>
Fighting Global Warming
</b>
<p>
<p>
Norton opposes efforts to curb global warming and has publicly questioned
whether global warming is a threat.
<p>
<p>
     In an editorial printed in the 6/29/1997 issue of The Gazetter
     (Colorado), Norton said: "Ironically, there is little consensus over
     whether global warming is occurring. Only 17 percent of the
     Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Society membership
     believes greenhouse gas emissions caused the warming earlier this
     century."
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p><b>
Gale Norton's Biography
</b>
<p>
<p>
Gail Norton is currently a lawyer with the firm of Brownstein, Hyatt,
Farber, and Strickland, where she specializes in business regulation and
the environment. She will not disclosed what clients she has worked for.
<p>
<p>
Norton sits on the board of the Independence Institute, a free-market think
tank in Golden, CO.
<p>
<p>
Norton is also a founder, and serves on the advisory committee, of the
Coalition of Republican Environmental Advocates (CREA), which is considered
by the Republicans for Environmental Protection (a legitimate GOP
environmental group) to be a greenscam: "a transparent attempt to fool
voters who care about environmental protection." CREA focuses on free
market and local solutions to environmental problems and counts Helen
Chenoweth and Senator Larry Craig as supporters. CREA actually gave an
environmental award to Newt Gingrich. Contributors to CREA include the
American Forest Paper Association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association,
ARCO and Amoco.
<p>
<p>
During the Reagan presidency, Norton served as Associate Solicitor at the
Interior Department where she authored and signed legal opinions supporting
drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Norton has also pointed to
the government's handling of endangered species cases as an example of
excessive regulation.
<p>
<p>
A former Libertarian, Norton vigorously supports private property rights in
takings cases. For example, she signed onto a letter addressed to Senator
Hatch supporting Congress' Constitutional authority to enact a law that strengthens personal property rights under the takings Provision of the Fifth Amendment. The bill, S. 1028, would have allowed citizens to bypass
state court and proceed directly to federal court with taking cases.

<p>
<p>
Norton was advocated Colorado's "self-audit" law, which allows companies to
conduct voluntary audits to determine whether they are complying with
environmental requirements. The law gives businesses immunity from
litigation and fines if they report the violations and correct them. The
federal EPA has objected to these self-audit laws. She wrote testimony
presented before the Senate EPW Committee in support of self-audit as an
antidote to the "command and control" approach of federal environmental regulations.
