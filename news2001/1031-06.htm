<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - October 31 - The upcoming meetings between President Bush&#146;s and Vladimir Putin in 
Washington and Texas November 12 - 14 have put the ABM Treaty and national 
missile defense back on the agenda after nearly two months in which 
terrorism drowned out all other issues. Decisions are likely to be made 
soon that will have a major impact on the progress of the missile defense 
program, the health of arms control efforts and the cohesion of the 
international coalition against terrorism.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==============================<br>
The U.S.-Russian minuet begins in Genoa<br>
==============================<br>
At their July 22 summit meeting in Genoa, Italy, Presidents Bush and Putin 
began a slow minuet in which they formally linked missile defenses with 
reductions in nuclear weapons.  There has been background music but little 
progress since, in part because the U.S. has yet to complete an on-going 
review of U.S. nuclear weapons policy and has not been prepared to propose 
specific levels of strategic nuclear weapons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">====================<br>
What happened in Shanghai<br>
====================<br>
When they came together again in Shanghai in mid-October, Bush and Putin 
reported progress toward agreement on both missile defense and nuclear 
reductions. President Bush said at his October 21 press conference with 
President Putin: &#147;We also see progress in our efforts to build a new 
strategic framework.&#148; President Putin agreed: &#147;I believe we do have an 
understanding we can reach agreements.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the two leaders continued to display major notes of discord.  Bush 
warned: &#147;The events of September 11 make it clearer than ever that a cold 
war ABM Treaty that prevents us from defending our people is outdated, and 
I believe dangerous.&#148; By contrast, Putin called the ABM Treaty &#147;an 
important element for stability in the world,&#148; and saw no connection 
between missile defense and September 11. &#147;It would be difficult for me to 
agree that some terrorists will be able to capture intercontinental 
ballistic missiles and will be able to use them,&#148; Putin said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The summit was also significant for steps not taken.  Some in the 
administration were pushing President Bush to set a deadline for an 
agreement and to stipulate that, if none were reached, the U.S. would give 
six months notice of withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, as provided for in the 
Treaty.  There were hints that a deadline was written into President Bush&#146;s 
talking points for the meeting.  However, Secretary of State Colin Powell 
said at an October 21 press briefing, &#147;We did not give formal or informal 
notification of an intention to withdraw from the ABM Treaty.&#148;  He added: &#147;The only talking points that count were the ones that came out of the 
President last night.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were also reports that the U.S. would propose a new lower limit on 
strategic nuclear warheads, probably not as low as Russia&#146;s suggested level 
of 1,500, but perhaps closer to 2,500.  Instead Bush said at his press 
conference: &#147;I told Mr. Putin that we are in the process of analyzing our 
nuclear arsenal,&#148; and National Security Adviser Condelzza Rice added that &#147;the President said that he would be getting back to President Putin soon&#148; 
on a number.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">===========<br>
The next steps<br>
===========<br>
Another overture was heard from the Bush side on October 25.  Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon was delaying some 
missile defense tests that would &#147;bump up&#148; against the ABM Treaty. This 
raised hopes that the two sides were moving closer to a deal.  U.S. 
Ambassador to Russia Sandy Vershbow said on October 26, &#147;I am more 
confident that we will find a mutually advantageous solution to the problem 
of missile defense because we now have a stronger commitment to meeting new 
threats together.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An agreement could be concluded when Putin meets Bush November 12 - 14 in 
Washington, D.C. and Crawford, Texas. However, it will be difficult to 
complete the technical aspects of the accord in the next two weeks. (The 
New York Times reported, however, that President Bush had a session on 
October 24 with the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the size and composition of 
the U.S. arsenal of nuclear weapons.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What would a deal look like? An agreement from the U.S. point of view would 
allow the United States to conduct a planned series of tests in coming 
years and construct new missile defense facilities in Alaska beginning next 
year.  While Russian officials have indicated they will not abandon the ABM 
treaty, even by mutual agreement, Russia seems to be moving toward an deal 
that permits more extensive U.S. testing and construction in Alaska that 
heretofore might have been considered in violation of the Treaty.  The 
Russians appear ready to accept any level of U.S. testing, but are 
insisting that an amended treaty remain in force and they are drawing the 
line at the moment at deployment, an issue to be wrestled with later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, any deal would also have to be accompanied by deep U.S. cuts 
in nuclear weapons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==================<br>
ABM Treaty dissonance<br>
==================<br>
Last July 17, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the Senate Armed 
Services Committee about three near-term missile defense activities that 
could violate the ABM Treaty. For the moment, two of those activities have 
been placed on hold. (The third is not scheduled until next year.) 
Secretary Rumsfeld announced the delay: &#147;On October 24th, an Aegis Radar on 
a surface ship was scheduled to track a strategic ballistic-missile test 
target, which it did not do.  In a separate operation, the Aegis Radar was 
to have tracked a Titan II space-launch vehicle scheduled for launch 
November 14th. During the October 24th test, the Aegis Radar was scheduled 
to have tracked the defensive interceptor; and during the same test, the 
multiple-object tracking radar at Vandenberg was to have tracked the 
strategic ballistic missile target.&#148; Rumsfeld&#146;s announcement could be 
viewed as positive signal to the Russians and the rest of the world that 
the United States would not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty.  However, it is also true that the tests were delayed for technical 
reasons unrelated to the ABM Treaty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More to the point, the tests cited by Rumsfeld are not crucial to 
development of missile defense at this stage.  Philip Coyle, a former 
director of testing and evaluation at the Pentagon, called the tests 
involving the Aegis radar a &#147;red herring&#148; because they would violate the 
treaty but are not particularly significant.  &#147;That's an example of one of 
the tests that they'd like to do that would bump up against the ABM 
treaty.  They picked a test that ... doesn't help that much with the 
overall development of the program,&#148; Coyle said at a press briefing last
month.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coyle has concluded that there is no urgent need to abrogate the treaty 
now. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last summer, 
he said, &#147;The treaty is not now an obstacle to proper development and 
testing of a national missile defense system.&#148; Operational testing &#147;would 
likely require modifications to the ABM Treaty,&#148; Coyle said. &#147;But there is 
plenty of time to consider this, as such real-world testing is many years 
away.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration also has said it needs to move beyond the ABM treaty 
because its plans for a new missile defense testing facility in Alaska 
would violate it.  But analysis by Coyle and others has shown that the 
Alaska site&#146;s value as a testing facility is also questionable. It appears 
that the Administration&#146;s real intent is to construct a rudimentary 
deployment site to be ready by 2004.  Two considerations suggest that such 
a deployment would have little value except to fulfill a Bush campaign 
pledge to deploy a national missile defense before the end of his first 
term. First, the current mid-course ground based system will not be 
adequately tested by 2004. Second, the current configuration of radars will 
limit the ability of the site to defend against attacks from North Korea, 
the &#147;rogue state&#148; so often cited as the ballistic missile threat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawrence Korb, an assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan 
Administration, said: &#147;The nightmare of the Republicans is that during this 
administration this program remains in R&amp;D as you do all of the tests...
They 
feel that if in fact Bush doesn't get re-elected, which is at least a 
reasonable possibility, they will not be able to deploy something. So 
therefore, the rush is to break the ABM Treaty and deploy something before 
2004. That's why we want to clear the brush at [the new testing facility 
at] Fort Greely, Alaska: so there is no turning back.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon has begun clearing the Fort Greely site.  Administration 
officials have suggested that if no agreement is reached with Russia in the 
next months, the administration may be prepared to give six months notice 
of withdrawal in January 2002.  That announcement could clear the way to 
begin construction &#151; the so-called pouring of concrete &#151; by the summer of
2002.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">=====================<br>
Senators remained concerned<br>
=====================<br>
While Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin shelved several 
Senate Armed Services Committee decisions that could have constricted the 
Administration&#146;s missile defense program, he continues to argue against any 
unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 22, in a speech delivered in Washington, Levin continued to 
press his case against unilateral withdrawal from the Treaty: &#147;The Bush 
administration has got to be very careful before they do it, because if we 
withdraw unilaterally, there will be more nuclear material on Russian soil, 
not less. That adds to the proliferation threat, which is the greatest 
threat we face, because there is nothing more threatening than a terrorist 
or a terrorist state getting their hands on nuclear material. And the more 
nuclear material there is on Russian soil, the greater the likelihood is 
that there could be theft or pilferage of some of that material getting 
into the hands of a terrorist.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Rumsfeld&#146;s October 25th announcement, Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Joe Biden declared: &#147;I'm happy they restrained. I don't 
think they would have restrained three months ago if they got to this 
point. . . . They are restraining now apparently because the president is 
in negotiations and doesn't want to, I assume, act unilaterally here.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==========<br>
ABM Finale?<br>
==========<br>
The Putin-Bush meetings in November will be pivotal for the future of 
national missile defense and arms control. The most desirable outcome is 
one that results in significant reductions in both nations&#146; nuclear 
arsenals and leaves the ABM Treaty intact. The least desirable would be a 
U.S. decision to give notice that it was withdrawing from the ABM Treaty 
with none or only modest cuts in nuclear weapons. The best guess is that 
the results will be somewhere in between &#150; some agreed modifications to the 
limits set by the ABM Treaty on missile defense testing, accompanied by 
cuts in offensive weapons.</font></p>
