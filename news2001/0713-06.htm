- June 13 - Campaign finance reform advocates inside and outside Congress are calling on House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) and the House Republican leadership to make good on their pledge to bring reform legislation to the House floor under fair rules for debate.  An unfair rule which would have denied sponsors Chris Shays (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) the opportunity to offer amendments to their bill in one legislative package was defeated by a bipartisan majority on Thursday - in the first key test vote in the House this year on the issue.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rule was defeated by a vote of 228 to 203.  Nineteen Republicans voted against the rule.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House Rules Committee, in a late-night meeting Wednesday night, rigged the rule for floor consideration of the Shays-Meehan bill so that key compromises accepted by Representatives Meehan and Shays would have to be presented to the House in 14 separate a la carte amendments, rather than as one package.  These compromises, which Shays and Meehan sought to present in one &#147;manager&#146;s amendment&#148; to the bill, were a key part of reform leaders&#146; &#147;pre-conferencing&#148; strategy, paving the way for a quick up-or-down re-vote in the Senate.  (The Senate passed very similar reform legislation, the McCain-Feingold bill, in April.)  By requiring separate votes on each amendment, opponents of the bill were using procedural tricks to split apart the delicately balanced bipartisan coalition for reform in the House.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Speaker Hastert should listen to the nineteen members of his caucus who took the extraordinary and courageous step of voting against the leadership&#146;s unfair rule,&#148; Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.  &#147;Speaker Hastert had promised a fair fight on reform, but he broke his word in the jerry-rigged rule that the leadership crafted in a midnight meeting and then brought to the floor.  After having his trick rejected by the House, Speaker Hastert should now make good on his promise for a fair rule, so the American people don&#146;t see this as just another example of a powerful politician saying one thing and doing another.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LEADERSHIP TACTICS SIMILAR TO &#145;98, &#145;99</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House Republican leadership has a long history of using parliamentary tactics to deny a fair debate and vote on campaign finance reform, according to Common Cause.  In both 1998 and 1999, a bipartisan majority, including most Democrats and about a quarter of House Republicans, rejected these tactics and extracted commitments to have the issue put before the House under fair rules.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 1998, for example, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) backed down on scheduling campaign finance reform only after some 200 Members of the House signed a discharge petition - a rare parliamentary tactic which forces legislation out of committee and onto the floor once a majority of Members - 218 - have signed.  Similarly, in May 1999, House Speaker Hastert was forced to back down on campaign finance reform when House Republicans began signing on to a discharge petition circulated by the Blue Dog coalition of conservative Democrats.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;House Speaker Hastert does not need to suffer the same kind of embarrassment he received in 1999, and that then-Speaker Gingrich faced in 1998,&#148; Harshbarger said.  &#147;All he has to do is let Shays and Meehan bring their bill to the floor with a fair rule, after which he and the other Republican leaders are free to try to vote it down or kill it by amendment.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake of the Thursday defeat for the House leadership&#146;s rule, Speaker Hastert told reporters in a news conference that he had &#147;no plans&#148; to reschedule campaign finance reform.  Key reform supporters in the Republican caucus however - including Members who have signed or threatened to sign a discharge petition in the past - are expected to make clear to Speaker Hastert that further delay is not a viable option.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although some Members of the leadership, like Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX), have tried to portray Representative Shays&#146; and Meehan&#146;s demand for a single package of amendments as unfair, the kind of rule that would be acceptable to them would still allow votes on competing campaign finance bills, such as the bill offered by Representative Bob Ney (R-OH).  Furthermore, a fair rule would still allow the GOP leadership or others to vote on amendments - even amendments that would have the effect of weakening or killing the bill.  All reformers want is an opportunity to offer a package of amendments for the Shays-Meehan bill - not to split those amendments up into 14 separate parts, as the Republican leadership&#146;s proposed rule would have done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ENCOURAGING SIGNS IN FIRST TEST VOTE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reformers see encouraging signs for the reform debate in the vote count which defeated the leadership&#146;s rule.  First of all, it is an impressive showing of strength by Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, whose leadership was critical to delivering all but one Democratic vote on the defeat of the rule (only the marginalized Representative James Traficant (D-OH) voted for the unfair rule.)  Common Cause also credits Gephardt with making an impassioned plea to members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus to support the bill and defeat the rule - making the case that their party should be united in favor of banning soft money.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plus, Common Cause interprets the fact that 19 Republicans defied their leadership - on a procedural vote that is virtually always a party-line affair - as a good sign that moderate Republicans are willing to put real pressure on Speaker Hastert to bring up the bill fairly.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;No one would prefer a discharge petition as the route by which reform comes to the floor of the House,&#148; Harshbarger said.  &#147;But it looms in the background as a credible alternative unless the House leadership reverses course, and decides to make good on their promise.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the meantime, organizations comprising the Americans for Reform coalition are committed to turning up the heat at the grassroots and applying pressure on the leadership and at key pressure points across the House.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This issue isn&#146;t going away.  In fact, with their arrogance and their treachery, Hastert, Armey, and DeLay have emboldened the reformers in their own party and have helped forge greater unity within the Democrats,&#148; Harshbarger said.  &#147;They should keep their promise to campaign finance reformers in the House - or else.&#148;</font></p>
