- February 15 -  The majority of black and
Hispanic families with children would receive no tax cut if the
Bush tax plan becomes law, according to a new analysis from the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan policy
institute in Washington D.C.
<p>The new analysis, "More Than Half of Black and Hispanic Families
Would Not Benefit From Bush Tax Cut," finds that 53 percent of
black and Hispanic families with children would receive no tax
reduction if the Bush plan were enacted. About three in four of
these families include someone who is working.
<p>The six million black and Hispanic families that would receive
no benefit from the proposal include 6.1 million black children and
6.5 million Hispanic children -- or 55 percent of all black
children and 56 percent of Hispanic children.
<p>The outcome reflects a Bush Administration decision not to
provide relief to low- and moderate-income working families that do
not earn enough to owe federal income tax but pay substantial
amounts of payroll and other taxes. Millions of black and Hispanic
families fall into this category. They are among the 74 percent of
American families that pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes.
<p>The center's analysis finds that black and Hispanic children
would be more than twice as likely to fail to receive any
assistance from the Bush tax plan as non-Hispanic white children.
<p>Tax Cut Would Drain Resources for Other Needs
<p>The exclusion of a majority of black and Hispanic families from
the Bush tax plan raises particular concerns, the center said,
because the tax plan would absorb virtually all of the available
budget surpluses projected for the next 10 years. The
administration has said the plan would cost $1.6 trillion over this
period, but the center's analysis finds that when the cost of added
interest payments on the national debt are taken into account, the
cost of the tax cut rises to $2 trillion or more. Interest
payments on the debt would be greater because at least $1.6
trillion of projected surpluses would be used for tax cuts rather
than for paying down the debt.
<p>With Congress walling off the portion of the budget surpluses
that are due to the building of reserves in the Social Security and
Medicare trust funds, the center noted, the amount of the surplus
available for all tax cuts and program initiatives is itself about
$2 trillion. As a result, the Bush tax cut would consume virtually
all of the available budget surpluses, leaving little available for
improvements in other areas, such as reducing the number of
Americans without health insurance, providing more housing that is
affordable for low- and moderate-income families, improving job
training programs, reducing child poverty, providing an adequate
Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors, and the like.
<p>High-Income Households Would Receive Bulk of Tax Cut
<p>Altogether, the administration's tax-cut proposal leaves out 12
million families with children and 24 million children (including
non-minority as well as minority families and children). But the
proposal carries a very high cost because it confers extremely
large tax cuts on wealthy households. The center reported that the
1 percent of households with the highest incomes would receive
about 40 percent of the tax cuts; the tax cut these households
would receive averages about $40,000 per household. By contrast,
the bottom 40 percent of households -- a group that includes a
majority of the black and Hispanic population -- would receive just
4 percent of the tax cuts, while the bottom 60 percent of the
population would receive 13 percent of the tax cuts.
<p>The center's analysis also finds that the top 1 percent of
households would receive more in tax cuts from the Bush plan than
the bottom 80 percent of households combined.
<p>The Bush tax cut leaves out large numbers of low- and
moderate-income families because it applies only to households that
owe federal income or estate taxes, as distinguished from other
taxes such as payroll taxes and excise taxes. A two-parent family
currently does not owe federal income tax until its income exceeds
$25,870. (If the family has child care costs, it owes no income
tax until its income reaches a higher level.) A family at this
level is well above the poverty line and pays several thousand
dollars in payroll taxes but would receive no tax reduction under
the Bush plan.
<p>"Although President Bush has been presenting his tax cut as
helping low- income families enter the middle class, his proposal
does little to achieve this goal," said Isaac Shapiro, who was
joined in authoring the study by Allen Dupree and James Sly.
Instead, Shapiro said, "his tax proposal provides windfalls to the
wealthiest Americans while draining the federal budget of resources
that could help low- and moderate-income families and aid
lower-income communities." The center study concludes that a
sounder approach would be to reduce the cost of the Bush tax plan
substantially by scaling back its very large tax cuts for
high-income individuals, while providing some tax relief to
lower-income families left out of the Bush plan.
