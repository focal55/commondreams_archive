- June 18 - When voters in 
Virginia's 4th Congressional District arrive at their polling 
places tomorrow many will find new help on hand to make sure they 
can cast their ballots unimpeded by many of the obstacles that 
plagued the Nov. 7 presidential election. It has now been 
reported that an estimated 2.5 million voters were disenfranchised 
last November -- including voters in Virginia. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than a hundred volunteers are being deployed at polling 
places wearing t-shirts to remind voters, &quot;You have the right to 
vote.&quot; Volunteers will give every voter a &quot;Voters' Bill of Rights&quot; 
and will offer immediate assistance to any voter who requests it. 
Backing up the on-site effort will be a team of voting rights 
lawyers, reachable through a toll-free hotline. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After November 7, it was clear that something had gone very 
wrong not just in Florida but around the country,&quot; said Ralph G. 
Neas, president of People For the American Way Foundation. &quot;It is 
a tragedy that millions of voters were denied their right to vote 
-- and we'll be in the 4th District to make sure that tragedy is not 
repeated.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Election 2000 taught us that it's not enough to urge voters to 
register and go to the polls, it's also crucially important for 
voters to have someone to be their advocate at the polls to help 
them solve problems when things go wrong,&quot; Neas said. &quot;That's what 
Election Protection is designed to do. We're testing it in the 4th 
District now and planning to expand nationally in 2002.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Election Protection project was created by the non-partisan 
People For the American Way Foundation and is being carried out in 
partnership with a number of other national and local civil and 
voting rights organizations. It is the second prong of a two-part 
PFAWF effort that pairs traditional get-out-the-vote (GOTV) 
activity with massive voter education and direct voter assistance 
to help assure that attempts to vote are not thwarted at the polls. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most intensive GOTV activities are focused primarily on 
Petersburg and other areas in the district with the highest 
percentage of African American voters, who have traditionally been 
underrepresented at the polls and more likely than other voters to 
suffer disenfranchisement. The on-site Election Protection 
activities will occur in these areas. (Virginia is one of the 
states covered by the federal Voting Rights Act because of a 
history of disenfranchising African American citizens.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Partnering with PFAWF in various aspects of this effort are: the 
NAACP National Voter Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and the 
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Together with People 
For the American Way Foundation, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil 
Rights Under Law, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and 
volunteer lawyers from the firm of Latham and Watkins are 
spearheading the effort to provide legal advice and assistance to 
voters who require such help in order to vote. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the three-day lead-up to the special election, which is being 
held to fill a vacancy created by the death of Rep. Norman Sisisky, 
and on election day, itself, PFAWF and its partner organizations 
are carrying out a massive voter education effort to alert voters 
to the special election and inform them of their voting rights, 
as well as protecting their rights at the polls. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activities include: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the weekend, volunteers hung reminders about the 
election and the Voters' Bill of Rights on 25,000 doorknobs in 
Petersburg and Lawrenceville.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$65,000 worth of radio ads are being broadcast through 
election day district-wide over stations that serve the African 
American community.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly 21,000 voters are receiving live phone calls reminding 
them to go to the polls on Tuesday. 
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the Sunday before election day, at least ten African 
American ministers distributed fliers urging their congregations to 
&quot;Get your souls to the polls.&quot; The same message is featured on 
10,000 signs displayed in stores, churches, and homes.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On election day, full-page ads featuring the Voters' Bill of 
Rights and a reminder to vote will appear in the the Hopewell News 
and the Progress-Index, which serve readers in Petersburg and the 
surrounding area.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On election day, two sound trucks will circulate through the 
neighborhoods urging voters to the polls.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Teams of Election Protection monitors will be stationed at 
polling sites on election day, backed up by toll-free access to a 
team of 25 volunteer lawyers. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Voters' Bill of Rights that is being distributed throughout 
Virginia's 4th Congressional District includes nine specific points 
to assure that voters are not disenfranchised: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. If you are in line at the correct polling place any time 
between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m., you have the right to vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. If you are registered to vote, but do not have a photo ID 
when the poll worker asks for one, you have the right to sign your 
name and vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. If you have moved, but are still qualified and registered to 
vote in the same precinct or district, you have the right to vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. If a poll worker cannot find your name on the list and has 
attempted to check your registration with the registrar, you have 
the right to cast a &quot;conditional ballot&quot; and vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. If you make a mistake and &quot;spoil&quot; your ballot, you have the 
right to receive another ballot and vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. If a disability prevents you from accessing the voting 
booths, you have the right to vote up to 150 feet outside the 
polling place, as directed by election officials. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. If you cannot read or write, or are disabled, you have the 
right to request special assistance to help you vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. You have the right to vote without being intimidated or 
forced to vote for someone for whom you do not wish to vote. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. You have the right to bring your children (15 years or 
younger) into the voting booth with you. </font></p>
