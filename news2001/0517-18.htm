Last Friday, Bush announced a $200 million contribution to the new UN 
AIDS trust fund, a sum called paltry by advocates who note that $7 10 
billion is needed to begin to control the epidemic. At the annual 
WHA, which mandates the work of the World Health Organization, the US 
delegation has worked to undercut support for lifesaving AIDS 
medication and related goods and materials; persisted in opposition 
to a badly-needed database on sources of drugs and costs; and refused 
to support an expansion of the antiquated Essential Drugs List. They 
have also refused to talk about accepted HIV prevention methods, such 
as condoms, speaking only of abstinence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Thompson has stated that AIDS requires the &quot;magnitude of the 
Marshall Plan,&quot; which brought substantial US financing to post-WWII 
Europe, his actions at the WHA have fallen far short of this 
pronouncement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, Thompson pledged allegiance to a group of representatives 
of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
Associations, saying, &quot;I want you to understand I'm fighting your 
fight for you. The Brazilians, they want this drug database.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, IFPMA ejected Brazilian government representatives from a 
press conference where they sought to discredit the highly successful 
Brazilian program of AIDS medication production, importation and 
distribution, which has cut their AIDS death rate by over half. There 
was also a delay in distribution to two key resolutions on drugs 
access sponsored by Brazil, reportedly due to US interference, that 
left delegates from across the world scrambling for copies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The US is using a series of dirty tricks to do the bidding of 
industry,&quot; added Paul Davis of the Health GAP Coalition, &quot;Instead of 
fighting AIDS, they are fighting off sound public health measures in 
the face of an escalating global crisis.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While delegations from poorer nations consist of one or two 
officials, the US delegation headed by Thompson includes over 20 
members and advisors, including Jeanne Head, UN lobbyist of the 
International Right to Life Federation. Representatives from the 
American Public Health Association, the American Medical Association, 
and other key public health professionals who usually participate as 
part of the US delegation were told their services are not needed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; Is the Bush Administration working towards the cause of global 
health, or for the drug industry and pro-lifers? He acts as if 
limited charitable reductions in the prices of some drugs will solve 
a global epidemic. Regarding HIV prevention, Thompson at the WHA has 
only talked about abstinence - as if it is the only way to prevent 
HIV,&quot; said Asia Russell of the Health GAP Coalition, in reference to 
yesterday's speech by Thompson. &quot;These purposeful oversights and 
departure from public health wisdom cost lives.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">US AND THE FUND</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kofi Annan, the United Nation's Secretary General, called for the 
creation of a huge health fund with an annual commitment of US$7-10 
billion during a meeting in Nigeria last month. Former President 
Clinton and others have commented that the US can afford, and should, 
provide 25% of this amount. However, the first government 
contribution to the fund has been a US$200 million donation made by 
the United States.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration's decision to give such a small amount has 
already threatened the life of the fund. Why are we sending Powell to 
feel the pain of Africa next week if we aren't also sending our fair 
share of resources,&quot; said Asia Russell of the Health GAP Coalition, 
referring to Powell's scheduled visit to African nations struggling 
to combat the escalating AIDS epidemic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At WHA, the Bush Administration has highlighted its stated intention 
to lobby for donations from corporations, in an effort to deflect 
overall attention from the paltry US contribution with an infusion of 
corporate charity. Already the lack of commitment from the Bush 
Administration to the UN Fund has had a chilling effect, as other G-8 
nations have de-emphasized their support of the fund, or have 
announced significant reductions in the amounts of earlier donation 
proposals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DELAY IN CIRCULATIONS OF RESOLUTIONS FROM BRAZIL AFTER U.S. COMPLAINTS</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Wednesday, there was an unprecedented delay in distribution of two 
resolutions from Brazil, regarding drug access, after the US vocally 
opposed the resolutions. This specifically violates WHA mandates, 
which state that all resolutions must be distributed with 24 hours 
notice to all delegates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first resolution, concerning the need for WHO to encourage member 
states to provide treatment for HIV,  the use of global fund for AIDS 
to include support for treatment, and the establishment of a drug 
database to assist countries in their efforts (see Drug Database, 
below).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second resolution addressed the WHO Revised Drug Strategy on the 
need for different prices for drugs, according to the resources and 
health needs of different nations</font></p>
<p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After the United States decried these resolutions, delegates had to 
fight to get a copy to even see them,&quot; explained Rob Weissman of 
Health GAP. &quot;It's no secret that the US is on a full offensive 
against Brazil, and the costs are open debate, full disclosure of 
information and, ultimately, lives.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DRUG DATABASE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Delegation advisor William Steiger, special assistant to Thompson, 
has cited easily debunked concerns about price collusion and US 
anti-monopoly laws as reasons to deny this essential tool to the 
world community. In addition, the US has stated that it is not the 
role of the WHO to be a clearinghouse for price information, even 
though this proposal is a key component of efforts to extend 
life-saving medication to the 50% of world residents with virtually 
no access to medication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the second year that the US has worked against WHO's creation 
of an accessible database of worldwide drug prices, providing crucial 
data for cash-strapped countries. Last year, the US led and won the 
fight to weaken Brazil's initial amendment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This common-sense tool could offer poor countries significant buying 
power, but remains unacceptable to the multi-national pharmaceutical 
interests crawling the halls at the Assembly,&quot; said ACT UP's Paul 
Davis. &quot;A simple database, updated regularly, would expose shocking 
price differences between patented and generic AIDS drugs.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  In many countries with generic competition, the price of patented 
drugs remains as much as 95% higher than the price of generic 
medicines. Much-touted price reduction offers from AIDS drug patent 
holders continue to place prices above generics and the vast majority 
of offers are extremely limited in geographical scope and only apply 
to government purchasing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  HEALTH GAP COALITION DEMANDS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Immediately cease opposition to, and interference with, proposals 
from resource-poor and non-G8 nations to increase access to AIDS 
treatment, care, and prevention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Allocate $2 billion in new US money to the UN fund for AIDS 
treatment, care and prevention</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Establish parity in financial support for treatment and prevention</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Support global AIDS drug distribution and procurement at lowest 
prices, including access to generics, and the establishment by WHO of 
a full drug database</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Immediately call on the IMF and World Bank to use its own 
resources to cancel debt owed by the world's poorest countries; the 
US must also call on the World Bank to abandon its support for user 
fees for health care and education</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Immediately end the WTO dispute against Brazil over compulsory 
licensing and Brazil's domestic patent law</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Support the creation of health exceptions to trade agreements, 
such as the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AIDS activist have called for public protest, focusing on the US 
stance on AIDS treatment, care, and prevention, on June 23, 2001, 
right before the opening of the UN General Assembly Special Session 
on HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
