- June 13 - The Association of State Green
Parties (ASGP) endorsed a resolution in support of the
"Charleston 5," dockworkers and members of the
International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), who
face spurious charges of "rioting" after the state of
South Carolina ordered a police assault against a
legitimate union protest in Charleston.  ASGP issues
the resolution, which is appended below, in response
to a call to action by the ILA and the Black Radical
Congress (BRC).

<p>The Charleston 5 are members of the ILA Locals 1422,
which is 99% African American, and 1771 who face
charges of felony assault and imprisonment for up to
five years, after the state of South Carolina
unleashed a police assault on dockworkers picketing to
oppose scab labor in Charleston.

<p>Nordana Lines, a shipping company, announced on
October 1, 1999 that it would convert to non-union
labor on ships in Charleston, after 23 years of using
ILA workers. The union responded with picket lines.
The state sent about 600 riot-equipped police in
armored vehicles, on horseback, and in helicopters and
patrol boats, and commenced a violent assault on the
picketers.   Five workers now face charges of
"inciting to riot" and are under house arrest.

<p>According to Frances M. Beal of BRC, "In the case of
these dockworkers, the State of South Carolina is
going even further to rein in black political power.
There is state legislation pending to inhibit the
right of unions to collect dues from their members,
and separate legislation to prohibit any union member
from being appointed to any board, agency or
commission in the state of South Carolina.... 'The
Attorney General is planning to run for governor next
time around and he's trying to make a name for
himself,' said South Carolina AFL-CIO President Donna
Dewitt. 'I think he plans to make himself a name at
the expense of these five guys.'" ("Black Labor Rights
on Trial in South Carolina," Black Radical Chronicles,
April 23, 2001)

<p>The police assault displayed military tactics, in
which urban police forces were trained on order from
President Clinton in the mid-90s.  The same tactics
were used to suppress dissent in Seattle in 1999 at
the WTO protests, in 2000 in Washington, DC at the
World Bank/IMF protests, and in Philadelphia and Los
Angeles during the Republican and Democratic Party
conventions.

<p>Nordana Lines later negotiated an agreement with ILA,
but WSI, the company that hired the nonunion workers,
has continued its lawsuit against the two union locals
and their presidents. 

<p>According to BRC, "the police arrested eight longshore
workers on charges of misdemeanor trespassing. At this
point State Attorney General Charlie Condon rushed in,
took the case away from local law enforcement
officials, and raised the misdemeanor charges to
felony rioting charges. At a preliminary hearing a
judge dismissed the felony charges for lack of
evidence, but Condon then went to the Grand Jury and
sought and obtained indictments against five of the
defendants, on the same charges that had just been
dismissed." 

<p>BRC also documents how state officials used the
assault against the dockworkers' union to suppress
political participation by black working people,
quoting Ken Riley, president of Local 1422: "These
longshore jobs are the only jobs in South Carolina
where a black can really move up from below poverty to
a middle class standard of living in a short time if
he comes out and applies himself....  Our problems
began when we started getting involved in state
politics."  The incident took place about the same
time as 47,000 people rallied in demand that the
Confederate flag be removed from the state capitol. 

<p>Mr. Riley himself had been nominated to the State
Ports Authority, but the South Carolina Manufacturing
Alliance and the state Chamber of Commerce pressured
the governor into withdrawing his name. BRC notes that
"Republican state legislators then introduced a bill
-- dubbed the Kenneth Riley Bill -- prohibiting union
members from serving on state boards and commissions. 
Its proponents touted it as a way to reduce union
influence in state politics -- in a state where only
3.8 percent of the workers are in unions. The bill
passed the House, but was killed in the state Senate."



<p>STATEMENT OF SUPPORT

<p>"The Association of State Green Parties supports the
International Longshoremen's Association (ILA),
AFL-CIO, and the Black Radical Congress (BRC) in
demanding dismissal of charges leveled against the
Charleston 5, dockworkers who face felony charges for
"rioting" in the wake of a military-style police
assault ordered by the state of South Carolina to
break up a union protest against union-busting and the
use of scab labor in the Charleston shipping industry.
 

<p>"We demand that the suit brought by Winyah Stevedoring
Inc. (WSI), the company that hired the nonunion
workers, against the two union locals and their
presidents be dropped or dismissed.  

<p>"We demand that the state of South Carolina not
support plans by WSI, Nordana, or any other company to
break the power of the ILA or any other union, and
that it cease using police power to suppress union
protest. 

<p>"We support the right of workers to organize and
bargain with employers, to protest peacefully against
unfair practices, full rights to political
participation, and the right to a decent standard of
living for African Americans, for other people of
color, and for all working people and poor people in
South Carolina and throughout the U.S.

<p>"We endorse the announced march on Columbia, the
capital of South Carolina, on June 9 to demand that
the state drop the criminal charges against the
Charleston 5 and that WSI drop the civil lawsuit
against both locals and their members, and we endorse
the call by the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union for a day of solidarity with the Charleston 5."
