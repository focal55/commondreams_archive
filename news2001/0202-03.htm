- February 2 - Citing a new poll showing
that Americans want their government to lead the way in reducing
world hunger, Bread for the World president David Beckmann today
called on Congress and the Bush administration to take up that
challenge.
<p>"The United States and other industrial nations have the
resources and the know-how to cut world hunger in half by the year
2015," Beckmann said. "We have lacked only the political will. In
this poll Americans say they want to end hunger and are more than
willing to pay their share."
<p>The new poll, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and conducted
by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy
Attitudes (PIPA), found that Americans overwhelmingly favor using
U.S. foreign aid to ease hunger and spur economic development in
the world's poorest countries. This is one of the first
comprehensive studies of American attitudes toward foreign aid
since 1995, when PIPA last conducted a similar survey. The study
included a nationwide poll of 901 randomly selected Americans as
well as focus groups and a review of polling by other
organizations.
<p>In its 1995 poll, PIPA found that 64 percent of the public
wanted to cut foreign aid, while the new poll shows this number has
fallen to 40 percent. The new study also clearly illustrates that
Americans would overwhelmingly support a global effort to reduce
hunger worldwide, specifically in Africa. Eighty-three percent of
the public said that the United States should be willing to commit
to a joint plan for cutting world hunger in half by the year 2015,
and 70 percent of respondents rejected the notion that, "The U.S.
has no vital interest in Africa."
<p>Beckmann predicted the poll would boost Bread for the World's
Africa: Hunger to Harvest campaign, in which thousands of church
members and others will urge Congress to make a long-term
commitment to help reduce hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, the world's
poorest region.
<p>"Many members of Congress mistakenly believe that Americans are
overwhelmingly against foreign aid and don't care about hungry and
poor people overseas," said Beckmann, a Lutheran pastor. "This
poll shows us that is not true."
<p>Bread for the World will propose that Congress begin by
approving an additional $1 billion a year in effective,
poverty-focused aid to Africa. That aid would include the next
installment of U.S. funds for international debt relief, $240
million for fiscal year 2002.
<p>"The total annual cost of this $1 billion package would be a
penny a day per American," Beckmann said. "With our country
expecting budget surpluses totaling $3.2 trillion over the next
decade, we surely can afford this investment in a healthier, more
secure world."
<p>Of those polled, 87 percent favored giving food and medical
assistance to countries in need. Seventy-three percent favored
U.S. aid to help poor countries develop their economies. And 75
percent said they would be willing to pay $50 a year in taxes to
cut world hunger in half.
<p>Africa: Hunger to Harvest is Bread for the World's principal
lobbying campaign for 2001. "We want the United States to focus on
Africa because that is where hunger is most widespread and
persistent," Beckmann said. "If we want to cut hunger in half
worldwide by 2015, our greatest challenge is in Africa."
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where hunger has more than
doubled over the last 30 years. One of every three people there is
chronically undernourished and 291 million people (as many as the
entire U.S. population) live on less than $1 a day.
<p>Africa's efforts to overcome poverty have been thwarted by civil
wars, the HIV/AIDS pandemic (which kills 6,000 people a day),
burdensome foreign debt, declining farm production, environmental
problems and other hardships. But recently there have been signs
of renewal, including new democratic governments, the rise of
grassroots organizations, and economic progress.
<p>With additional aid, African countries could begin to make
investments to work themselves out of poverty. These might include
enrolling more children in school (especially girls, who are often
kept out), improving farm production and food distribution,
treating and preventing HIV/AIDS and other diseases, encouraging
business investment, building roads, and fostering small
businesses.
<p>During the last Congress, Bread for the World was a key part of
the Jubilee 2000 coalition that persuaded a once-reluctant Congress
to approve debt relief for poor countries. BFW members generated
approximately 250,000 letters to Congress in support of debt
relief. The organization also was instrumental in securing U.S.
food stamp program reforms to help about a million low-income
households.
<p><i>Bread for the World is a 45,000 member Christian citizens'
movement against hunger. Founded in 1974, Bread for the World's
members lobby Congress and the administration to bring about public
policy changes that address the root causes of hunger and poverty
in the United States and overseas. Bread for the World is a
nonpartisan organization supported by 45 denominations and many
theological perspectives. Please visit our Web site at
