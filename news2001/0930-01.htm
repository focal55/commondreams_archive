<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHICAGO - September 30 -  The Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Founder &amp; President of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition today releases this statement. &quot;We are at war.&quot; We must never give up on the pursuit of peace with long-term security and remedy. This is not a short-term battle; it is deeply rooted in alienation and bitterness born of too many walls and too few bridges. Too many diplomatic disconnects not enough intelligence sharing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have built walls around our G8 industrialized allies many of whom are former or colonial powers. We have not built enough bridges to the Non-align nations, the poor, the disinherited, and the majority. We must all fight the war on terrorism. We must define it and root out the conditions that feed it. Sometimes it is fed by the greed of the oppressors who oppose the self-determination movements of the locked out. Sometimes it is the desperation of the suffering using violent tactics in attempts to destabilize the status quo. It may be the voices of the unheard or it may be those who seek to silence them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Terrorism is a form of intimidation, it may be physical, psychological, political or economic --- to control. It may be used by the state to stop self-determination or democracy. In South Africa or Germany, it was used as a tactic of racial or religious profiling. It may be used to oppress or it may be used tactfully by the oppressed. It is always violent. We must seek to end terrorism and oppose its root causes wherever it is made manifest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We must not find false security in a global heart for one man and a one country made for T.V. war. It is spread much wider, it has multi cells. For example there are many trails to Germany as well as to Afghanistan. The failure of foreign policy has backed up into our cities. We now face the risk of dropping bombs in Afghanistan that could explode at home. This war is being waged in our own country not on our own terms. Finding Osama bin-Laden in the hills is treacherous and dangerous. For example we have not found the Atlanta Centennial Terrorist Bomber in our own country, apparently they're hiding somewhere in the hills.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush and Secretary Powell have wisely shifted from isolation policies to coalition building, from unilateral decisions to multilateral consultation. Global coalition is required to fight global terrorism. It requires a global coalition to fight global terrorism its causes and effects. We need allies, precise intelligence, patience, persistence and determination, not indiscriminate bombing. The coalition is new and fragile and conditional. Some of our allies in the coalition must review their commitment to self-determination international law and human rights. As the world turns our country must be on the right side of history as people emerge from bondage, colonialism and despicable levels of poverty. To often in Africa, Asia and the third World we choose our friends and economic interests over principles of democracy that our nation holds dear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today all of America is Ground Zero not just New York. The war has already begun, the commandos are on the ground. The U.S. led coalition supports the north in the current Civil War. We are seeking to disband the Taliban by reaching out to our former friends. We are not unfamiliar with the Taliban Leadership. We gave them $43 million in the anti-drug effort in May and humanitarian aid and military assistance against the Russians. Our allies, Russia, Egypt, India, and Pakistan who declared that they would not help us militarily must send delegations and share intelligence and involve the clerics from their countries with contacts in Afghanistan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember September 11, we had superior military strength but with diplomatic disconnects and economic sanctions and lack of shared intelligence. We had no capacity to determine who nor when nor whom we should strike. Religious leaders played a crucial role in Islamic societies. Our organization in consultation with other religious organizations must build a world consensus against terrorism's causes and effects. These clerics have moral and humanitarian appeal. They have political strength within their own country. Don't underestimate the voices of conscious. Ultimately, it affects public policy. Whether Bonhoeffer in Germany or Bishop Tutu in South Africa or Dr. King in the USA, the religious sector matters. Our missions abroad, Syria, Cuba, Iraq and Yugoslavia, they were all religious delegations with connections in those countries, with which we had political disconnects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the crossroads should we pursue revenge or remedy, shall we get even or shall we get ahead. Avoiding war that achieves the objectives of rooting out terrorists and their bases is at least as noble as a bloody war without end that in the end recycles violence. Shall we become the best at waging war or the best at ending and preventing war and its causes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The religious leaders press conference in Afghanistan was significant. One, they did not hurl invectives at us. Two they did not call for defiant demonstrations, they did not call for holy war, they said show us the evidence. All of our allies will require the evidence if he is sought dead or alive, that means fight or negotiate. We urge them to make the decision that Khadafy made an international jurisprudence world court process. What do we do if he is turned over. President Bush did not say shoot on sight, he said dead or alive, if he is alive our coalition allies need the evidence and will help negotiate the process of his location the rules of evidence, the lawyers and the judges. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While I appreciate the two invitations sent by the Taliban to come, to which our religious leaders will respond to in writing, to date the matters of substance were not addressed in the invitations. The eight Christians on trial today we appeal for their unconditional release and we urge them to turn over the suspects to an international process as Khadafy did. Without a commitment to address the substantive issues put forth by the world coalition and end that war that has already begun on the ground. A physical mission to Afghanistan at this time would be to perilous and without a reasonable risk ratio for achieving the objectives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While I am disappointed that the Taliban apparently spurned the appeal of the Pakistani delegation, the attempt to persuade and appeal to the Taliban to choose world court over world war must continue. Each coalition member should send a delegation as Pakistan did and share intelligence. We must never grow weary of diplomatic bridge building appeals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rainbow PUSH Coalition will continue to meet with world religious leaders. Leaders of Islam, Russian Orthodox churches, Kofi Annan, Nelson Mandela, Bishop Tutu, and Andy Young have roles to play in world court rather than world war. I repeat the Taliban must pursue the option of Khadafy and the Lockerbie trial and choose the international judicial process. The future of the Taliban is in a world coalition against terrorism, poverty, illiteracy and disease, for drinkable water (5 million die each year) against AIDS (100 million victims in 5 years). Afghans are suffering, presently there are 500,000 orphans and 5 - 7 million refugees in surrounding countries. They must reject resorting to the hills in world isolation and a bloody war prolonging poverty of some of the world's poorest people. </font></p>
