<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 
- September 17 -  In the wake of the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, many media pundits focused on one theme: retaliation. For some, it
did not matter who bears the brunt of an American attack:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is only one way to begin to deal with people like this, and that is
you have to kill some of them even if they are not immediately directly
involved in this thing.&quot;<br>
--former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger (CNN, 9/11/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The response to this unimaginable 21st-century Pearl Harbor should be as
simple as it is swift-- kill the bastards. A gunshot between the eyes, blow
them to smithereens, poison them if you have to.  As for cities or countries
that host these worms, bomb them into basketball courts.&quot;<br>
--Steve Dunleavy (New York Post, 9/12/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;America roused to a righteous anger has always been a force for good.
States that have been supporting if not Osama bin Laden, people like him
need to feel pain. If we flatten part of Damascus or Tehran or whatever it
takes, that is part of the solution.&quot;<br>
--Rich Lowry, National Review editor, to Howard Kurtz (Washington Post,
9/13/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;TIME TO TAKE NAMES AND NUKE AFGHANISTAN.&quot;<br>
--Caption to cartoon by Gary Brookins (Richmond Times-Dispatch, 9/13/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At a bare minimum, tactical nuclear capabilites should be used against the
bin Laden camps in the desert of Afghanistan. To do less would be rightly
seen by the poisoned minds that orchestrated these attacks as cowardice on
the part of the United States and the current administration.&quot;
--Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Thomas Woodrow, &quot;Time to Use
the Nuclear Option&quot; (Washington Times, 9/14/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill O'Reilly: &quot;If the Taliban government of Afghanistan does not cooperate,
then we will damage that government with air power, probably. All right? We
will blast them, because...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sam Husseini, Institute for Public Accuracy: &quot;Who will you kill in the
process?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Reilly: &quot;Doesn't make any difference.&quot;<br>
--(&quot;The O'Reilly Factor,&quot; Fox News Channel, 9/13/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is no time to be precious about locating the exact individuals
directly involved in this particular terrorist attack.... We should invade
their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.  We
weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top
officers.  We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians.  That's war.
And this is war.&quot;<br>
--Syndicated columnist Ann Coulter (New York Daily News, 9/12/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
<b>&quot;Real&quot; Retribution</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many media commentators appeared to blame the attacks on what they saw as
America's unwillingness to act aggressively in recent years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer (Washington Post, 9/12/01)
wrote: &quot;One of the reasons there are enough terrorists out there capable and
deadly enough to carry out the deadliest attack on the United States in its
history is that, while they have declared war on us, we have in the past
responded (with the exception of a few useless cruise missile attacks on
empty tents in the desert) by issuing subpoenas.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington Post's David Broder (9/13/01), considered a moderate, issued
his own call for &quot;new realism-- and steel-- in America's national security
policy&quot;: &quot;For far too long, we have been queasy about responding to
terrorism. Two decades ago, when those with real or imagined grievances
against the United States began picking off Americans overseas on military
or diplomatic assignments or on business, singly or in groups, we delivered
pinprick retaliations or none at all.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's worth recalling the U.S. response to the bombing of a Berlin disco in
April 1986, which resulted in the deaths of two U.S. service members: The
U.S. immediately bombed Libya, which it blamed for the attack. According to
Libya, 36 civilians were killed in the air assault, including the year-old
daughter of Libyan leader Moamar Khadafy (Washington Post, 5/9/86). It is
unlikely that Libyans considered this a &quot;pinprick.&quot; Yet these deaths
apparently had little deterrence value: In December 1988, less than 20
months later, Pan Am 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in an even
deadlier act of
terrorism the U.S. blames on Libyan agents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, in 1998, Bill Clinton sent 60 cruise missiles, some equipped
with cluster bombs, against bin Laden's Afghan base, in what was presented
as retaliation for the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. One missile
aimed at Afghan training camps landed hundreds of miles off course in
Pakistan, while a simultaneous attack in Sudan leveled one of the country's
few pharmaceutical factories. Media cheered the attacks (In These Times,
9/6/98), though careful investigation into the case revealed no credible
evidence linking the plant to chemical weapons or Osama bin Laden, the two
justifications offered for the attack (New York Times, 10/27/99, London
Observer, 8/23/98).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the dubious record of retributory violence in insuring security,
many pundits insist that previous retaliation failed only because it was not
severe enough. As the Chicago Tribune's John Kass declared (9/13/01), &quot;For
the past decade we've sat dumb and stupid as the U.S. military was
transformed from a killing machine into a playpen for sociologists and
political schemers.&quot; This &quot;playpen&quot; dropped 23,000 bombs on Yugoslavia in
1999, killing between 500 and 1,500 civilians, and may have killed as many
as 1,200 Iraqis in 1998's Desert Fox attack (Agence France Presse,
12/23/98)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Wall Street Journal (9/13/01) urged the U.S. to &quot;get serious&quot; about
terrorism by, among other things, eliminating &quot;the 1995 rule, imposed by
former CIA Director John Deutsch under political pressure, limiting whom the
U.S. can recruit for counter-terrorism. For fear of hiring rogues, the CIA
decided it would only hire Boy Scouts.&quot; One non-Boy Scout the CIA worked
with in the 1980s is none other than Osama bin Laden (MSNBC, 8/24/98; The
Atlantic, 7-8/01)-- then considered a valuable asset in the fight against
Communism, but now suspected of being the chief instigator of the World
Trade Center attacks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Who's to Blame?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In crisis situations, particularly those involving terrorism, media often
report unsubstantiated information about suspects or those claiming
responsibility-- an error that is especially dangerous in the midst of calls
for military retaliation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Early reports on the morning of the attack indicated that the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine had claimed responsibility on Abu
Dhabi Television. Most outlets were careful with the information, though
NBC's Tom Brokaw, while not confirming the story, added fuel to the fire:&quot;This comes, ironically, on a day when the Israel Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres is scheduled to meet with Yasser Arafat. Of course, we've had the
meeting in South Africa for the past several days in which the Palestinians
were accusing the Israelis of racism&quot;-- as if making such an accusation were
tantamount to blowing up the World Trade Center.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hours after a spokesperson for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine denied any responsibility for the attack, the Drudge Report
website still had the headline &quot;Palestinian Group Says Responsible&quot; at the
top of the page.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though the threat from a Palestinian group proved unsubstantiated, that did
not stop media from making gross generalizations about Arabs and Islam in
general. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wondered (9/13/01):&quot;Surely Islam, a grand religion that never perpetrated the sort of Holocaust
against the Jews in its midst that Europe did, is being distorted when it is
treated as a guidebook for suicide bombing. How is it that not a single
Muslim leader will say that?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, many Muslims would-- and did-- say just that.  Political and
civil leaders throughout the Muslim world have condemned the attacks, and
Muslim clerics throughout the Middle East have given sermons refuting the
idea that targeting civilians is a tenet of Islam (BBC, 9/14/01; Washington
Post 9/17/01).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
<b>Why They Hate Us</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the media investigation focused on Osama bin Laden, news outlets still
provided little information about what fuels his fanaticism. Instead of a
serious inquiry into anti-U.S. sentiment in the Middle East and elsewhere,
many commentators media offered little more than self-congratulatory
rhetoric:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;[The World Trade Center and the Pentagon] have drawn, like gathered
lightning, the anger of the enemies of civilization. Those enemies are
always out there.... Americans are slow to anger but mighty when angry, and
their proper anger now should be alloyed with pride. They are targets
because of their virtues--principally democracy, and loyalty to those
nations which, like Israel, are embattled salients of our virtues in a
still-dangerous world.&quot;<br>
--George Will (Washington Post, 9/12/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This nation symbolizes freedom, strength, tolerance, and democratic
principles dedicated to both liberty and peace. To the tyrants, the despots,
the closed societies, there are no alterations to the policies, no gestures
we can make, no words we can say that will convince those determined to
continue their hate.&quot;<br>
--Charles G. Boyd (Washington Post, 9/12/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Are Americans afraid to face the reality that there is a significant
portion of this world's population that hates America, hates what freedom
represents, hates the fact that we fight for freedom worldwide, hates our
prosperity, hates our way of life? Have we been unwilling to face that very
difficult reality?&quot;<br>
--Sean Hannity (Fox News Channel, 9/13/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our principled defense of individual freedom and our reluctance to
intervene in the affairs of states harboring terrorists makes us an easy
target.&quot;<br>
--Robert McFarlane (Washington Post, 9/13/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One exception was ABC's Jim Wooten (World News Tonight, 9/12/01), who tried
to shed some light on what might motivate some anti-U.S. sentiment in the
Middle East, reporting that &quot;Arabs see the U.S. as an accomplice of Israel,
a partner in what they believe is the ruthless repression of Palestinian
aspirations for land and independence.&quot; Wooten continued: &quot;The most
provocative issues: Israel's control over Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem;
the stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia near some of Islam's holiest
sites; and economic sanctions against Iraq, which have been seen to deprive
children there of medicine and food.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stories like Wooten's, which examine the U.S.'s highly contentious role in
the Middle East and illuminate some of the forces that can give rise to
violent extremism, contribute far more to public security than do pundits
calling for indiscriminate revenge.</font></p>
