- May 25 - &quot;Proposals that had seemed to be dead under the Republican-controlled
Senate &#151; such as a patients bill of rights &#151; were immediately back in play.
 Others &#151; such as ballistic missile defense &#151; now look shaky at best.&quot;<br>
	Washington Post - May 25, 2001 - Greg Schneider</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;&#145;Globally, the whole universe moves left and moderate,' said Hudson
Institute political analyst Marshall Wittman. &#145;Conservation yes,
exploration, no. Missile defense, Social Security privitization -- those
now on life support.'&quot; <br>
	Newsday (New York, NY) - May 25, 2001</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The sudden shift to Democratic control of the U.S. Senate could upset Bush
administration plans to speed development of a controversial missile
defense system, analysts told Reuters on Thursday. But only &#145;time will
tell,' said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, a key proponent of an
anti-missile defense program that is bitterly opposed by Russia and China
and has raised major questions among U.S. allies.&quot;<br>
	Reuters - May 24, 2001 - Charles Aldinger</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Missile defense may have hit a wall.&quot;<br>
	Tim Russert on WTOP News - May 25, 2001 (not from transcript)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Jeffords's shift signaled a far-reaching realignment in national politics,
catapulting Senate Democratic leader Thomas A. Daschle (S.D.) into the
majority leader's post occupied by Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and
threatening many of Bush's initiatives, from boosting energy production to missile defense to filling federal judgeships
with conservatives.&quot;<br>
	Washington Post - May 25, 2001 - John Lancaster &amp; Helen Dewar</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A Senate suddenly controlled by Democrats could blunt President Bush's
drive for national missile defense and might lead to more military bases
being closed.&quot;<br>
	  Copley News Service - May 24, 2001 - Otto Kreisher</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With their new majority, the Democratic opposition will have new ways to
slow down the rest of Bush's agenda, including his energy policy and
proposed missile defense shield, as well as appointments to federal
judgeships.&quot; <br>
	The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - May 25, 2001 - Julia Malone </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They [the Administration] want missile defense, the whole military issue.
That hasn't come up yet. Democrats don't like that. They think that it's a
lot of wasted money on a program that has not been thoroughly tested. That
program could be in very serious trouble.&quot; <br>
	CNN Live Today - May 23, 2001 - William Schneider</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords from the Republican party spells
trouble for most of President Bush's agenda.  That is particularly true in
one area: His commitment to defend the American people, their forces, and
allies overseas against ballistic-missile attack.&quot;<br>
	National Review Online - May 24, 2001 - Frank Gaffney OpEd</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee says he's
wary of any move by President Bush to abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to build a national missile defense system.  Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., said he's no longer sure that's the administration's plan . . .
The views of the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee gained
traction Thursday as Sen. James Jeffords turned the Senate topsy-turvy with
the announcement he will quit the Republican Party and become an
independent. That tosses the chamber's majority power to the Democrats and
the Armed Services chairmanship to Levin.&quot;<br>
	AP  - May 24, 2001- Carolyn Skorneck</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Democrats also now will control the committees, and that could cloud the
outlook for many of the proposed Bush initiatives on energy and missile
defense.&quot;<br>
	The Kansas City Star - May 25, 2001 -  David Goldstein</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Like any party in opposition to the president, Senate Democrats are eager
to slow -- if not block -- much of Bush's program, including proposals to
allow oil drilling in sensitive areas, allow workers to divert Social
Security taxes into private investments and develop a national missile
defense system.&quot; <br>
	Knight Ridder - May 25, 2001, Friday - Steven Thomma</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Being in charge does mean you can block things -- like Bush's
missile-defense proposal, something adamantly opposed by many Democrats.&quot;<br>
	The Orange County Register - May 25, 2001, Friday - Dena Bunis </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bush will actually have to negotiate policy with Democrats, and do it
early and often if he is to maintain the momentum built up in the heady,
now-bygone days of Republican dominance on Capitol Hill. That should force
him toward the political center on issues as varied as energy policy,
environmental protection, the federal judiciary, campaign-finance reform,
Medicare prescription-drug coverage and missile defense.&quot; <br>
	Newsday (New York, NY) editorial - May 25, 2001</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Meanwhile, another potential troublemaker for missile defense proponents
is Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) who becomes chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, replacing Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). Biden last year
pushed former President Clinton to hold off in making any decision to
deploy a missile defense by 2005 (Defense Daily, June 28). And, Biden is
sure to try to thwart any attempts in Congress to do away with the ABM
Treaty.&quot;<br>
	Defense Daily - May 25, 2001 - By Kerry Gildea</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Levin warned that if Bush proposes to spend money for the defense system&#145;that constituted a breach of the ABM Treaty' he would strike it from the
committee's defense bill.  That would require the supporters to fight to
get it included on the Senate floor, could make it subject to a
jurisdiction claim by Biden and would make its approval harder.&quot;<br>
	AP  - May 24, 2001- Carolyn Skorneck</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Levin will be a leading opponent of Bush's plan to deploy a missile
defense system to protect the United States and its allies from ballistic
missile attack. He has said that if Bush abrogates the 1972 ABM Treaty,
which was negotiated with the former Soviet Union, it &#145;could result in more
nuclear weapons on Russian soil, increase the risk of proliferation of
these weapons, lead Russia and others to develop, deploy and even sell countermeasures to our defenses, (and) cause China to increase their
nuclear arsenal.' All this, Levin argues, would make the United States less
secure, not more secure.&quot;<br>
	MSNBC - May 25, 2001 - Tom Curry</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On issues from missile defense to creating a more conservative judiciary,
President Bush's agenda suddenly faces rougher sledding . . . It elevates
some of the strongest skeptics of the administration's drive for a missile
defense system, putting Senator Carl Levin of Michigan in line to be
chairman of the Armed Services Committee and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. in
line to be chairman of Foreign Relations . . .The Senate changeover is
likely to have a significant impact on President Bush's plans to build a
ballistic missile shield. Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden and Mr. Levin are all
strong supporters of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty, which
administration officials contend must be modified or scrapped so the United
States can proceed with the kind of system that Mr. Bush advocates.
	All three men have urged the administration to deploy a missile shield
only once it has been proved to work &#151; in contrast to Secretary of Defense
Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has called for quick deployment, even if a system
is only partly effective.
	Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said of the power shift, &#145;It
will prompt serious and fundamental questions about the technological
feasibility, the cost of the system, the reliability and whether or not it
contributes to increased stability throughout the world.'&quot;<br>
	New York Times, May 25, 2001 - Robin Toner</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who becomes chair of the Senate Armed
Services Committee (SASC) strategic forces panel, will make a speech at the
National War College outlining his views on missile defense. The strategic
forces plan has jurisdiction over funding for the missile defense programs. 
	While Reed to date has not outlined a clear alternative to the Bush plan,
it is clear he is in step with Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who becomes the
new SASC chairman. Like Levin, Reed has been opposed to a rapid deployment
of a missile defense system and is expected to push to keep the ABM Treaty
and other arms control measures intact. Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.), who
moves to the ranking slot on the strategic forces panel, has been an ardent
supporter of a robust missile defense, with land, sea and space components
and replacing the ABM Treaty with a new framework.&quot;<br>
	Defense Daily - May 25, 2001 - By Kerry Gildea</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Larry Korb, a former assistant defense secretary and now with the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York, said the change would &#145;make a very big
difference.' &#145;If the administration decides that it wants to start digging holes in
Alaska to plant missile defense weapons before those weapons work, you will
hear quickly and decisively from Levin,' Korb said.&quot;<br>
	Reuters - May 24, 2001 - Charles Aldinger</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Jesse Helms will lose the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee
to Joseph Biden, who will be less hostile to the United Nations and less
receptive to missile defence. Michigan's Carl Levin is likely to become
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, enabling him to scale back
presidential plans for a national missile defence.&quot;<br>
	The Times (London) - May 25, 2001, Friday - Martin Fletcher  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Among the controversial Bush plans that could now be at risk are his 'Son
of Star Wars' strategy for missile defence, and policies that would allow
more oil drilling in sensitive areas and the abolition of environmental
safeguards.&quot; <br>
	Daily Mail (London) - May 25, 2001 - William Lowther </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The areas where Democrats will hit the president hardest are on his power
to appoint conservative judges and on his more controversial legislation on
energy, the environment and missile defence.&quot;<br>
	The Daily Telegraph (London) - May 25, 2001 - Ben Fenton</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On a host of President George W. Bush's core issues - from energy to
deregulation to missile defence to trade - the loss of the Senate will make it considerably
more difficult for the White House to push its agenda.&quot;<br>
	Financial Times (London) - May 25, 2001 - Edward Alden  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr Bush and Dick Cheney, the vice-president, have laid out plans for a new
missile defence programme but now face an uphill battle in gaining approval.&quot;<br>
	Financial Times (London) - May 25, 2001 - Deborah McGregor</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Plans to appoint unrepresentatively ultra-conservative judges to the
federal bench and the Supreme Court, when vacancies occur, should be one
casualty. Another may be Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld's ambitious,
unfocused and dangerous missile, space and conventional weapons-building
schemes.&quot; <br>
	The Guardian (London) - May 25, 2001  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Political analysts predicted that the change would block President Bush's
controversial programme, from his plans to build a missile defence system
to his producer-friendly energy policies.&quot;<br>
	The Guardian (London) - May 25, 2001 - Julian Borger </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr Biden will bring with him renewed commitment to Europe and the
transatlantic alliance, and some searching questions about the cost of Mr
Bush's pet missile defence programme. The chances of the massive spending
needed for the programme being adopted very soon will be diminished further
by the arrival at armed services of Mr Levin, a sceptic on missile defence.&quot;<br>
	The Independent (London) - May 25, 2001- Mary Dejevsky </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a result, Democrats' ability to challenge Bush's policies in such
controversial areas as national missile defense and China will be enhanced,
but not guaranteed as senators -- now divided 49-50-1 -- are not obliged to
vote down party lines.&quot;  <br>
	Agence France Presse - May 25, 2001, Friday - Sharon Behn </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This will make it difficult for Mr Bush to get key points of his
conservative programme through Congress. These include plans to drill oil
in areas such as the Arctic wildlife refuge in Alaska, appointment of
conservative judges to the Supreme Court to replace retiring members, the
controversial education voucher system providing public funding for private
education, the missile defence system, and confirmation of appointments to top positions in government, of which only 11 percent so far have been
approved.&quot;<br>
	Channel NewsAsia - May 25, 2001</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The future of his administration's recently unveiled energy plan, aimed at
encouraging more oil drilling, coal mining and nuclear plants, has been
cast into serious doubt. So has Bush's plan to build a controversial
anti-ballistic shield against missile attack.&quot; <br>
	The Gazette (Montreal) - May 25, 2001 - Robert Russo</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President George W. Bush could soon find many of his top priorities, such
as an energy policy which calls for more drilling and pipelines, judicial
appointments for more right-wing thinkers and a costly and untested missile
defence plan, falling by the wayside.&quot; <br>
	The Toronto Star - May 25, 2001 - William Walker </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They will be able to block conservative judicial appointments, stop the
regulatory dismemberment of workplace and environmental laws, and temper
the national missile defence plan.&quot; <br>
	The Ottawa Citizen - May 25, 2001 - Hilary Mackenzie </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A Democrat-held Senate may also assert the concern of many in the party
about the impact of missile defence on relations with other emerging powers
and on the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty signed with the Soviet Union in
1972 - which the administration wants to rewrite or tear up.&quot;
