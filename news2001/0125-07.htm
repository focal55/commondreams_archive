- January 25 - President George W. Bush in his first week in Washington has
warned of a "huge energy crisis," threatened to invade the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge to drill for oil and gas, rejected calls
to remove dams to save Pacific salmon, and told CNN, "If there's
any environmental regulations that's preventing California from
having a 100 percent max output at their plants, as I understand
there may be, then we need to relax those regulations."
<p>By early February, the president's allies in Congress plan to
introduce legislation to attack the Arctic Refuge -- among other
hasty measures that would give up too much, to get too little
energy, too late.
<p>In response, American Rivers President Rebecca R. Wodder today
issued the following statement:
<p>"President Bush has wasted no time in declaring that the 'energy
crisis' warrants a rollback in environmental regulations. This is
hasty, unwise, and unnecessary, and it's not what the American
people voted for on Election Day.
<p>"The short-term energy problems that California is experiencing
are the fault of poor management and maintenance by the utility
corporations themselves, combined with a failed state deregulation
scheme. The new president should not try to blame those problems on
citizens who want their environment protected, or imagine that
rolling back environmental protections will solve them.
<p>On removing dams to save salmon:
<p>"In particular, American Rivers rejects the notion that America
has to give up on saving the legendary wild salmon of the Snake
River just to close a short-term gap between energy supply and
demand. Although the President has claimed that, 'I don't notice
anybody talking anymore about breaching the dams to save the salmon
now that there's a huge energy crisis,' the two are not linked. The
existing energy shortage will be resolved in the next few years,
whereas the removal of the Snake River dams will not occur for at
least five years. The weight of scientific evidence indicates that
the Snake River's wild salmon will go extinct without dam
breaching. And as recently as last month, tens of thousands of
Northwest residents successfully appealed to the White House to set
dam removal in motion in five years, if needed to save the salmon.
<p>"Demand can and will be reduced immediately through
conservation. Efficiency measures can follow; we still waste two
out of every three energy dollars in this country. And within 2-3
years, new generating plants with pollution-limiting technology
will be online to handle future needs. Driving wild salmon into
extinction for eternity is not worth a tiny fraction of one percent
of our nation's energy needs, which is all it would take to remove
four Snake River dams that are killing salmon, and to operate all
the rest of the nation's hydroelectric dams in an environmentally
sound manner. Finding such win-win solutions is the goal of the Low
Impact Hydropower Institute, which American Rivers is proud to
support.
<p>On the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:
<p>"We also reject the claim that it is necessary to invade one of
our country's most pristine environmental sanctuaries with drilling
rigs, waste dumps, roads, pipelines, and other facilities that
would permanently scar the land, fragment wildlife habitat, and
clog its rivers, for the sake of a few months' worth of energy, 10
years or more from now. Ruining the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
for a few months' supply of oil that far in the future will in no
way benefit California's present and future needs for electricity.
<p>"President Bush has stated twice in the past week that he will
review 'all federal lands' for oil and gas exploration, without any
mention of excluding national parks, monuments, wilderness areas,
other wild public lands, or wild and scenic river corridors from
the review. That would turn on its head decades of precedents on
protecting our most sensitive federal lands.
<p>Solving the "energy crisis":
<p>"Will we sacrifice the last best places and the last of wild
species to avoid acting responsibly for a few more years?
<p>"What will it take for us, as a nation, to get serious about
renewable energy and conservation?
<p>"What will it take to get far-sighted leadership from our
elected officials that will put us on a path to a sustainable
future?"
<p>"So far, the Bush administration's solutions to the short-term
energy shortage in California seem to be to dam, dig, drill, and
burn our way out. This will not only fail to help those who are now
suffering from rolling blackouts, it will endanger the health of
our citizens and leave future generations with a legacy of
destruction and extinction.
<p>"We don't have to give up environmental protection for economic
progress. Instead, we need solutions that are sustainable and
forward-thinking:
<p>-- "We must ensure that we use best practices and
state-of-the-art technologies in our current energy production
methods;
<p>-- "We must further develop and support alternative
technologies, including wind power, fuel cells, and decentralized
energy production;
<p>-- "And we must aggressively support energy efficiency and
conservation programs that will allow us to enjoy a better standard
of living while using half of the energy, as people already do in
Japan and Europe.
<p>-- "This is the best path out of the current energy shortfall,
not slashing environmental protections we'll need long after this
current crisis has passed."
