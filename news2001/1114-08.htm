<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- November 14 - On the heels of what has been called the greatest World Series
in recent memory, Major League Baseball owners last week voted
to eliminate two teams from the league next season, blaming a
mix of economic woes and lack of fan support. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But as the league prepares to announce which of its 30 teams
will face the ax, politics could prove to be a major deterrent,
especially if Congress has anything to say about it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least a dozen members of Congress--including Michigan Rep.
John Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee--have threatened to introduce legislation that would
revoke Major League Baseball's unique antitrust exemption, which
allows owners to control movement of teams from one city to the
next. Minnesota Sens. Paul Wellstone (D) and Mark Dayton (D)
already have sponsored such a bill, hoping to use it as leverage
to protect their hometown team, the Minnesota Twins, from
contraction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, several members of Virginia's congressional
delegation have jumped on the bandwagon, too-but for entirely
different reasons. Late last month, Virginia Sens. George Allen
(R) and John Warner (R) and Reps. Frank Wolf (R), Tom Davis (R)
and Jim Moran (D) hinted in a letter to baseball commissioner
Bud Selig that they, too, would take a second look at the
league's antitrust exemption should he not support Northern
Virginia's bid for a major league franchise. Last week, Davis,
who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee (the
House GOP's chief fund-raising arm), told reporters that he
would do what it takes to keep the Minnesota Twins from
folding--so that the team ultimately could be moved to Virginia. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, none of these threats are new. For years, Congress
has debated legislation that would roll back the 1922 law that
shields Major League Baseball from most antitrust rules, and for
years, the league has blocked such bills. The only exception: a
1998 law signed by President Clinton that removed the league's
antitrust exemption on labor disputes with players. Since then,
Major League Baseball has upped its lobbyist payroll in
Washington to more than $1 million annually, according to
disclosure reports filed with the Senate. That's more than
double what the other professional sports leagues--the National
Basketball Association, the National Football League and the
National Hockey League--spend annually inside the Beltway,
combined. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like other industries, Major League Baseball also supplants its
lobbying with campaign contributions, having doled out $70,000
in soft money contributions during the first six months of 2001,
two-thirds to Democrats. That's just a few thousand dollars more
than the league and its employees contributed during the entire
1999-2000 election cycle alone--not including the $100,000 the
league contributed to the Bush-Cheney Inaugural Fund late last
year. Adding to that arsenal, Major League Baseball recently
filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to open its
own political action committee-the first major sports league to
operate its own PAC.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the league's biggest influence in Washington may not come
via the commissioner's office or through its well-connected
roster of lobbyists--which includes Lucy Calautti, wife of Sen.
Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). Instead, baseball's real pull may come
from the individual teams' front offices, where some of the
nation's biggest political contributors call the shots.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, Carl Lindner, top banana at Chiquita (and the
American Financial Group) and the sixth biggest individual
campaign contributor during the 2000 elections, owns the
Cincinnati Reds. Attorney Peter Angelos, No. 8 on the list of
biggest givers, owns the Baltimore Orioles, and William O.
DeWitt, one of President Bush's top fund-raisers during the last
campaign and co-chairman of Reynolds, DeWitt &amp; Co, is the man
behind the St. Louis Cardinals. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All told, Major League Baseball teams and their owners
contributed more than $3.9 million in soft money &amp; individual
contributions during the 1999-2000 election cycle, 60 percent to
Democrats. (Of that total, more than $75,000 was contributed to
President Bush.) That doesn't include contributions made by the
corporate owners of Major League Baseball teams, including
Atlanta Braves owner AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co,
which reportedly hopes to unload its Anaheim Angels via the
planned contraction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With those kind of political connections, team owners are hoping
to keep Congress and President Bush--a former owner of the Texas
Rangers--out of the mix when it comes to the future of Major
League Baseball. But that lobbying already is being countered by
the Major League Baseball Players Association-which has asked
Bush to block the planned contraction-and other well-connected
political donors like Fred Malek ($60,457 during 1999-2000; 96
percent to Republicans). Malek, who heads a group wanting to
bring baseball to Washington, was partners with George W. Bush
in the ownership of the Texas Rangers and was former President
George H.W. Bush's campaign manager in 1992. </font></p>

owners and employees gave during the 2000 elections and the
