- May 16 -  A Pinellas County, Fla., ordinance requiring charitable
organizations to register with the county before soliciting donations from residents is
unduly burdensome and violates the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause, according to a lawsuit filed today in federal court in
Tampa.
<p>Not only does the law require charitable organizations to provide highly detailed,
burdensome and invasive information as a condition of obtaining and keeping a license to
solicit contributions from Pinellas County residents, but it even gives the county
discretion to deny groups the right to solicit donations based on a review of the wording
of solicitation letters&#151;a form of censorship, the suit says. The law also requires
nonprofits to register with the county simply because they receive an unsolicited
contribution via the Internet, thereby sweeping within its reach charitable groups
worldwide that have no connection whatsoever with the county.</p>

<p>The suit was filed against Pinellas County, Fla., by Public Citizen, Greenpeace,
American Charities for Reasonable Fundraising Regulation, and the Nonprofit Federation, a
division of the Direct Marketing Association that represents hundreds of nonprofit groups.
The groups filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. </p>

<p>&quot;These types of licensing and reporting requirements impose tremendous and
unnecessary costs on groups like ours, both to collect the information and to put it into
the specific place on the individual form for each jurisdiction where we are supposed to
register and report,&quot; said Joseph A. Zillo, Public Citizen&#146;s chief operating
officer. &quot;We already fully report to the IRS in a very detailed Form 990, which is
available on our Web site and will be sent to anyone who asks for one. The information on
the 990 is more than any contributor could reasonably want to know, and we cannot fathom
why states and localities would think they need anything more. Even so, we have registered
with and supplied extensive information to dozens of states across the country, including
Florida. To expect charities to register in and report to thousands of local governments
nationwide on top of that is just too much. We cannot do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Although the Pinellas County ordinance went into effect in 1993, the county has grown
increasingly aggressive in recent years in attempting to enforce it, sending letters to
charities across the country threatening sanctions if they do not register and pay the
requisite filing fee. Several aspects of the ordinance are particularly burdensome and
invasive, far exceeding what other jurisdictions and the IRS require. </p>

<p>For example, the ordinance and permit application form require the charity to state
whether any of its directors, officers or employees are related to any other director,
officer, owner or employee of the organization or to that of any of the group&#146;s
vendors or suppliers. Similarly, the law requires disclosure of whether any director,
manager, or specified official have ever been employed by or a member of another
organization registered in Pinellas County. Such requirements would force charities to
take the unusual step of investigating not only the employment and professional histories
of its various directors, officers and employees, but also the relationships among its
employees, consultants, mail houses, office supply stores and other entities with whom the
groups contract. Also troubling for many charities is the ordinance&#146;s requirement
that charitable groups turn over for the county&#146;s review copies of written
solicitations and phone scripts, opening the groups up to potential censorship by the
county.</p>

<p>The law requires detailed information about each solicitation, including the
contemplated receipts and expenses of the solicitation, the proportion of contributions
that will go to the object of the solicitation, and the distribution plan for the
contributions&#151;information that can be difficult to compile and that changes
frequently. The ordinance imposes detailed financial reporting requirements, demanding
reporting of such information as expected gross revenue, contributions and fundraising
expenses,<b> </b>anticipated management and general expenses. As Zillo said, &quot;We do
not even keep our books at the level of specificity or in the categories demanded by the
Pinellas County ordinance. We would have to hire a new staff and overhaul our accounting
system to be able to report the kind of financial information the ordinance requires
&#151; neither of which we are able or willing to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Moreover, changes in information on a registration form, as occasioned by the
appointment of a new officer or director, the hiring of a relative by an entity with which
the charity contracts or the development of new solicitation materials, must be updated
for the county within 15 days.</p>

<p>The complaint sets forth several legal bases for the challenges. The plaintiffs rely on
the First Amendment &#151; which the Supreme Court has held protects charitable
solicitations &#151; in asking the court to strike down both the registration and
reporting requirements. The groups also rely on the Commerce Clause in contending that the
reporting requirements are unreasonably burdensome and therefore interfere with interstate
commerce. With respect to the county&#146;s attempt to regulate the Internet, the groups
cite not only the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause, but the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, which governs whether the county has jurisdiction to regulate
charities&#146; use of the Internet.</p>

<p>Pinellas County and the state of Florida are not alone in seeking to regulate
charitable solicitations. Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia require
charitable organizations to register if they intend to solicit. The nature of what must be
reported varies widely, forcing charities to struggle to keep up with mounting
registration fees and staggering piles of paperwork. </p>

<p>&quot;One of the reasons that we are filing this lawsuit,&quot; Zillo said, &quot;is
that as cities and counties have begun to impose greater and more disparate reporting
requirements on charities, the effort to comply with the numerous competing sets of
registration and reporting requirements has become increasingly onerous, costly,
time-consuming and difficult. We believe it is time to take steps to stop this trend
before it truly overwhelms us.&quot;
