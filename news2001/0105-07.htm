- January 5 - An alliance of 17 leading nuclear non-proliferation 
  organizations commended retired General John Shalikashvili's on his 
  report to the President and Secretary, <I>Findings and Recommendations 
  Concerning the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</I> (CTBT), and urged the 
  President-elect and the Senate to use it as the starting point for rebuilding 
  a bipartisan consensus on nuclear testing and non-proliferation.
<P>"General Shalikashvili's report on the CTBT should 
  serve as the basis for a more balanced, less politicized dialogue on the CTBT and its 
  value to America's national security," said Daryl G. Kimball, director of the 
  Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers. "By itself, the CTBT cannot stop 
  proliferation, but the U.S. cannot effectively fight the spread of nuclear 
  weapons without it," said Kimball. "The new Senate and the new President owe 
  it to the nation to work together in a bipartisan fashion to undertake a more 
  thoughtful and balanced review of the CTBT," he added.</P>
  
  <P>"We are convinced that with careful study and a thorough exchange of 
  information, broader agreement can be forged on the CTBT so as to allow for 
  U.S. ratification. General Shalikashvili's report provides an excellent basis 
  for further deliberation on how to rebuild the bipartisan American consensus 
  on nuclear arms control and non-proliferation," said Thomas Graham, Jr., 
  President of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security</P>
  
  <P>In his letter to the President accompanying the report, which was released 
  today, General Shalikashvili said: "My discussions over the last ten months 
  have only strengthened my view that the Treaty is a very important part of 
  global non-proliferation efforts and is compatible with keeping a safe, 
  reliable U.S. nuclear deterrent."</P>
  
  <P>Shalikashvili found that "[t]he nation's nuclear arsenal is safe, reliable, 
  and able to meet all stated military requirements. For as far into the future 
  as we can see, the U.S. nuclear deterrent can remain effective under the Test 
  Ban Treaty...." He recommends that the next administration review, prioritize 
  and support the stockpile stewardship program to ensure that the U.S. nuclear 
  arsenal remains safe and reliable without further test explosions. He also 
  calls for sustained support for non-proliferation-related intelligence 
  resources, and an ongoing commitment to improving national and international 
  test monitoring capabilities, as well as test site transparency initiatives to 
  further increase confidence.</P>
  
  <P>"General Shalikashvili's report underscores the importance to U.S. security 
  of early ratification of the CTBT," said Spurgeon Keeny, President of the Arms 
  Control Association. "By outlawing nuclear tests, the CTBT will prevent the 
  development of new, more advanced weapons by nuclear states, and severely 
  constrain the nuclear weapons potential of countries that do not now have such 
  weapons," he added. "Experts agree that the U.S. does not need nuclear test 
  explosions to maintain its arsenal. So, it is clearly in the United States' 
  interest to ratify the Treaty to encourage others to do so and to implement 
  the Treaty's far-reaching verification provisions," Keeny argued.</P>
  
   <P>General Shalikashvili also said "...I have found broad bipartisan support 
  for strengthened U.S. leadership of a comprehensive international response to 
  the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons. ... I hope that the 
  next Administration and the Senate will re-evaluate the Test Ban Treaty as 
  part of a bipartisan effort to forge an integrated non-proliferation strategy 
  for the new century." </P>
  
  <P>"President-elect Bush should recognize that there is broad-based support for 
  the CTBT," said John Isaacs, President of the Council for a Livable World. "Many 
  Democrats and Republican moderates agree with the view of Senators Chuck Hagel 
  (R-NE) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) who have said&nbsp;' ... a clear majority of the 
  Senate, have not given up hope of finding common ground in our quest for a sound 
  and secure ban on nuclear testing.' " </P>
  
  <P>"The new President can ill-afford to ignore, let alone renounce, the United 
  States' decades-long commitment to the comprehensive test ban," noted 
  Isaacs.</P>
  
  <P>General Shalikashvili suggests that uncertainties about the CTBT can be 
  addressed by strengthening the "safeguards" to accompany the Treaty by 
  conducting a thorough review of the effect of the CTBT on U.S. security ten 
  years after ratification. Former Nixon Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, who 
  opposed the CTBT in 1999, has said that with such measures, "...my concern 
  over the indefinite ban on testing could largely be met. I would then agree 
  that being party to a CTBT, by preserving the qualitative advantage of our 
  nuclear arsenal and constraining the further development of advanced nuclear 
  weaponry, would be in the best interest of the United States."</P>
  
  <P>In his report, General Shalikashvili also cautions against attempts by the 
  U.S. to "renegotiate" the CTBT and failure to reconsider the Treaty. He 
  reports that: "A prolonged [test] moratorium would do less damage to U.S. 
  non-proliferation objectives ... than a resumption of testing, but most of the 
  benefits that the Test Ban Treaty can provide would be lessened or lost 
  without ratification."</P>
  
  <P>President-elect George W. Bush campaigned against ratification of the CTBT, 
  but he has stated his support for continuation of the U.S. nuclear test 
  moratorium in place since September 1992. Some of his cabinet appointees, like 
  General Colin Powell, are on record in support of the CTBT, others like 
  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld oppose it.</P>
  
  <P>"Putting partisan politics aside, the political ground truth is that 
  nuclear test explosions are no longer acceptable to the vast majority of 
  states, including all of America's closest allies," observed Christopher 
  Paine, a senior researcher with the Natural Resources Defense Council in 
  Washington, D.C. "The Bush Administration cannot reasonably expect to resume 
  nuclear testing unless it is also prepared to cripple or destroy the Nuclear 
  Non-Proliferation Treaty."</P>
  
  <P>"A hard-headed view of U.S. national security interests recognizes that a 
  U.S.-led return to nuclear testing would be a colossal security policy blunder 
  with unpredictable and potentially lethal consequences," Paine said. "While 
  the technical benefits of nuclear explosions are realistically no longer 
  available to the new Administration, the benefits from U.S. ratification and 
  entry-into-force of the CTBT are within reach. Our own security interests 
  dictate that President Bush should not allow the previous Senate's 
  thumb-in-the-eye of the international community to be America's last word on 
  the CTBT," he added.</P>
  
  
<P>The CTBT was negotiated with U.S. leadership and opened for signature in 
  1996. To date, the Treaty has been signed by 160 states, including 41 of the 
  44 states required for entry into force, and ratified by 69, including 30 of 
  the 44 required states. All NATO member states -- except the U.S. -- have 
  ratified the CTBT. In April 2000, the Russian Duma approved ratification of 
  the Treaty. In May 2000, the 180+ states gathered for the NPT Review 
  Conference expressed unanimous support for "... signatures and ratifications, 
  without delay and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional 
  processes, to achieve the early entry into force of the Comprehensive 
  Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty."</P>
