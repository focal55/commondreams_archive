&nbsp;
<p>Note To The Press
<p>Attached for your information is a memorandum entitled "The
Constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform
Bill."
<p>The memorandum was prepared by Fred Wertheimer, President of
Democracy 21 and Don Simon, General Counsel of Common Cause, and
explains why the two principal provisions of the McCain-Feingold
bill, the soft money ban and the provisions to deal with
so-called "issue ads," are constitutional. On Wednesday, February
28, the Supreme Court will hear oral argument in the case of FEC
v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado II).
<p>This case involves the question of whether Congress can
impose a spending limit on the amount of hard money that a party
spends in coordination with its candidates, according to
Wertheimer and Simon.
<p>The case does not involve the question of whether a ban on
soft money contributions to a party would be constitutional. The
Supreme Court has consistently upheld the constitutionality of
restrictions on contributions to candidates and parties.

McCain-Feingold
Campaign Finance Reform Bill

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p>The two principal provisions of the McCain-Feingold campaign
finance reform legislation are Title I, which bans political
party soft money, and Title II (the Snowe-Jeffords provision)
which bans the use of corporate and labor union funds to pay for
broadcast ads that refer to federal candidates in the sixty day
period before an election, and requires disclosure for such ads
run by other groups and by individuals.
<p>Each provision involves separate constitutional issues, which
are addressed below.
<p>I. General constitutional principles
<p>The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress can act,
consistent with the First Amendment, to protect the political
process from corruption and the appearance of corruption caused
by money.
<p>In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), the Court upheld
limits on contributions by individuals to candidates, to the
political parties and to political committees. These limits, the
Court said, "limit the actuality and appearance of corruption
resulting from large individual financial contributions." 424
U.S. at 26.
<p>Further, the Court said that limits on contributions -- as
opposed to limits on expenditures -- "do not undermine to any
material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion
of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens,
associations, the institutional press, candidates and political
parties." Id. at 29.
<p>Last year, in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri PAC, 528 U.S. ---,
145 L. Ed.2d 886 (2000), the Court strongly reaffirmed this
ruling. It upheld a $1,050 individual contribution limit in
Missouri law on the ground that the legislature "could
constitutionally address the power of money 'to influence
governmental action' in ways less 'blatant and specific' than
bribery." 145 L.Ed.2d at 899 quoting Buckley, 424 U.S.
at 28.
<p>The Court noted its concern with "the broader threat from
politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors"
as a constitutionally sufficient justification for limiting
contributions. Id. Such limits are justified, the Court said,
not only by the compelling governmental interest in deterring
corruption, but also the appearance of corruption: "Leave the
perception of impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption
that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness
of voters to take part in democratic governance." Id. at 900.
<p>Similarly, the Court has upheld a total ban on contributions
and expenditures by corporations and labor unions in connection
with federal elections. The corporate ban has been a part of
federal law since 1907, and the union ban since 1947.
<p>The ban on corporate contributions, the Court held, serves to
combat "the corrosive and distorting effects of immense
aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the
corporate form.." Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce,
494 U.S. 652, 660 (1989).
<p>Thus, the existing framework of the federal campaign finance
law limits the size of contributions that can be made to federal
candidates and political parties by individuals and political
committees to influence federal elections. It also prohibits
altogether such contributions (as well as expenditures) from
corporate and union sources. This framework has been upheld by
the Supreme Court as consistent with the First Amendment and
constitutional.
<p>II. A ban on soft money is constitutional
<p>A ban on soft money operates mainly as a restriction on the
kind of contributions that can be made to the national parties.
The ban prohibits the national parties from soliciting or
receiving contributions that do not comply with federal campaign
finance limits.
<p>As such, the soft money ban would close loopholes now being
used to massively evade the existing federal limits on the
contributions that can be given to the national parties and to
federal candidates for the purpose of influencing federal
elections.
<p>A soft money ban is a contribution restriction -- precisely
the kind of restriction that the Supreme Court has consistently
upheld as constitutional and permitted by the First Amendment.
<p>Soft money is money that does not comply with federal
contribution limits or source prohibitions. The theory of soft
money is that it is raised and spent by the political parties for
activities that do not affect federal elections, and therefore it
does not need to comply with the federal fundraising rules.
<p>This theory is demonstrably false.
<p>In reality, the political parties raise and spend soft money
for activities that are clearly for the purpose of influencing
federal elections and electing federal candidates -- such as
"issue ads" promoting specific federal candidates and
get-out-the-vote drives in federal election years.
<p>Furthermore, federal officeholders and candidates are the
principal fundraisers of soft money. For example, the four
congressional campaign committees -- committees that are
comprised exclusively of Members of Congress -- raised and spent
some $200 million in soft money during the 2000 elections.
<p>In the 2000 elections, furthermore, some two-dozen Senate
candidates from both parties created special committees so they
could personally solicit their own unlimited soft money
contributions to be used to support their candidacies.
<p>These Senate candidates each formed a so-called "joint
fundraising committee" sponsored by their own Senate campaign
committee and their party's Senate campaign committee (the NRSC
or DSCC). The "joint committee" operated as vehicle for the
Senate candidates to directly solicit their own unlimited soft
money contributions to support their campaigns.
<p>The soft money funds were then transferred to the NRSC or
DSCC, which transferred the funds to the Senate candidates' state
parties. The state parties then spent the soft money on "issue
ads" and other activities promoting the Senate candidates.
<p>The evidence is overwhelming that the theory of soft money --
that it is not being used to influence federal elections -- is a
complete fiction.
<p>Title I of McCain Feingold contains three provisions that are
essential to banning soft money. These provisions:
<p>(1) prohibit the national political parties from raising or
spending any money that does not comply with federal contribution
limits and source prohibitions;
<p>(2) prohibit federal officeholders and candidates from
raising or spending any money in connection with any election
unless the money complies with federal law; and
<p>(3) require state parties to use money that complies with
federal campaign finance rules when the state parties fund
"federal election activities" -- such as "issue ads" promoting
federal candidates and get-out-the-vote drives in federal
election years.
<p>These three provisions, taken together, end the soft money
system. All three provisions are necessary to effectively shut
the system down.
<p>If, for instance, as in the bill sponsored by Senator Hagel
(R-Neb.), federal candidates are allowed to continue raising soft
money and state parties are allowed to continue spending that
soft money on activities to support these federal candidates --
soft money will continue to flow unabated in federal elections.
<p>Critics charge that Title I in McCain-Feingold is
unconstitutional. They argue that the provision is an
unconstitutional infringement on the ability of parties to
express their views and that parties should be free to exercise
their First Amendment speech rights without restrictions on the
funds used to exercise those rights.
<p>Critics also argue that the parties spend money that is not
for the purpose of influencing federal elections - i.e., for
state and local activities, or for issue discussion - and
therefore the parties should, in any event, be free to raise and
use money for these non-federal purposes without complying with
federal contribution limits.
<p>There are a number of answers to these arguments.
<p>First, the ban on soft money is consistent with the
contribution prohibitions and limits that the Supreme Court has
already upheld as constitutional.
<p>The Court in Buckley found it constitutional for Congress to
limit the amount of money that an individual can give to a
political party to protect against corruption and the appearance
of corruption arising from large contributions. The Court in
Austin for similar reasons found it constitutional to ban
corporate contributions to political parties.
<p>Thus, a ban on soft money contributions to the national
political parties is well within existing constitutional
doctrine. Indeed, the purpose of the ban on soft money is to
close a loophole that is allowing the wholesale evasion of the
existing, constitutional limits on contributions to national
parties and federal candidates.
<p>Similarly, a requirement that state parties use funds that
comply with federal contributions limits when they are making
expenditures on federal election activities is designed to close
a loophole whereby state parties are spending funds that do not
comply with federal contribution limits to influence federal
elections.
<p>Second, in upholding contribution limits, the Court has
focused on the corrupting effect that corporate, union and large
contributions have on the recipient, whether a candidate or a
party.
<p>Thus, the fact that the parties may spend money on
non-federal, as well as federal, activities does not entitle the
parties to receive contributions that the Court has agreed pose a
serious risk of corruption of federal officeholders. Such
contributions, whether made directly to candidates or to their
parties, can be regulated consistent with the First Amendment.
<p>Third, a ban on soft money does not bar speech by parties.
The parties are free to raise as much hard money as they wish.
The Court in Buckley held that a limit on contributions does not
inhibit speech by candidates; it just requires them to raise
contributions from more sources. The same is true of a ban on
parties raising soft money: they must just raise more hard money
to pay for their speech.
<p>Fourth, insofar as the soft money ban would require state
parties to use money subject to federal limits to finance
"federal election activity," there is no Tenth Amendment or other
federalism problem. State parties already are required by
federal law to spend only money subject to federal limits on
activities that are for the purpose of influencing federal
elections.
<p>The effect of the soft money ban is to extend this clearly
constitutional rule to four specifically defined categories of
federal election activities -- such as ads that deal with federal
candidates and get-out-the-vote drives in federal election years.
The bill does not "federalize" state parties.
<p>Finally, a ban on soft money does not conflict with the
Supreme Court's ruling in Colorado Republican Campaign Committee
v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604 (1996) (Colorado I). In that case, the
Court held that Congress could not limit the amount of hard money
spent by a party independently of one of its own candidates to
support that candidate. But that case involved a provision very
different from a ban on soft money. First, it addressed a limit
on spending by a party, not on contributions to a party. And
second, the case involved party hard money, not soft money.
Nothing in Colorado Republican I limits the ability of Congress
to ban soft money.
<p>III. The Snowe-Jeffords provision regarding "issue ads" is
constitutional
<p>The Snowe-Jeffords provision contained in the
McCain-Feingold bill applies an additional test for defining what
constitutes a campaign ad for purposes of the federal campaign
finance laws. The provision is intended to help ensure that ads
that are clearly campaign ads intended to influence federal
elections are subject to federal campaign finance rules.
<p>The provision includes in the definition of a federal
campaign ad, a broadcast ad that refers to a clearly identified
federal candidate and that is broadcast within 60 days of an
election (called in the bill an "electioneering communication").
<p>Under the Snowe-Jeffords provision, such campaign ads may not
be paid for with corporate treasury or union dues funds. (They
can be paid for by corporate and union PACs, which are funded
solely by voluntary individual contributions.)
<p>Non-profit advocacy corporations (such as the Right to Life
Committee or the Sierra Club) may pay for such ads, provided the
funds for the ads come only from individual contributions that
have been raised specifically to pay for such ads. These groups
must file disclosure statements listing their expenditures for
the ads and the individual contributors of $1,000 or more who
paid for the ads.
<p>The groups, furthermore, may set up a separate account for
the ads and disclose only the contributors of $1,000 or more to
that account, or alternatively they can disclose the contributors
of $1000 or more to their organizations.
<p>The Snowe-Jeffords provision is necessary to close a loophole
in existing law, which allows many ads that are clearly federal
campaign ads to escape the coverage of federal campaign finance
laws.
<p>Under current law, ads "in connection with" a federal
election -- in other words, campaign ads -- must be paid for with
money subject to federal campaign finance limits, known as hard
money. That means corporations and unions cannot use their
treasury funds to pay for such ads. (A corporation or union,
however, can use PAC money raised under federal law from
individuals to pay for such ads, and individuals can use their
personal funds.)
<p>The problem has come in drawing the line between what
constitutes an ad that is a campaign ad, and therefore subject to
campaign finance laws, and what constitutes an ad that is an
issue discussion ad, and therefore constitutionally protected
from government regulation.
<p>In Buckley, the Supreme Court found that for purposes of
applying the federal campaign finance laws to non-candidates and
outside groups, statutory language such as "relative to" an
election or "in connection with" an election is
unconstitutionally vague because it draws too imprecise a line
between campaign activity that may be regulated by law and issue
discussion that may not.
<p>In holding that these portions of the statute were
impermissibly vague unless construed narrowly, the Court then
proceeded to construe the provisions narrowly to apply only to
ads containing "magic words" such as "vote for," "vote against,"
"support," "defeat," etc.
<p>This ruling in Buckley (and in a subsequent 1986 case,
Massachusetts Citizens for Life v. FEC, 479 U.S. 539 (1986))
applied only to ads run by non-candidates and outside groups.
The "magic words" test did not apply to ads run by candidates,
political parties or political committees, all of which, the
Court said, engage in activities which are "by definition,
campaign-related." 424 U.S. at 79.
<p>But even in regard to ads run by non-candidates and outside
groups, it has become overwhelmingly clear that the "magic words"
test is insufficient. This test has proven to be a completely
unrealistic means of defining whether an ad is a campaign ad.
<p>Most campaign ads by non-candidates and outside groups (as
well as by candidates and parties) simply do not use "magic
words" like "vote for" or "vote against." Instead, such ads
praise or criticize candidates by name in a way that makes their
intent to advocate unmistakable.
<p>Particularly where such ads are run right before an election,
it is overwhelming clear that they are intended by their sponsors
to be campaign ads, and they have the same effect on the voters
as campaign ads. As a matter of common sense and political
reality, such ads should be treated by law the same as any other
campaign ads, whether or not they use "magic words."
<p>That, in essence, is the effect of the Snowe-Jeffords
provision.
<p>Critics argue the Snowe-Jeffords provision is
unconstitutional because it "bans" protected issue speech by
corporations or unions. According to this position, only ads that
contain "magic words" can be subject to regulation under federal
campaign finance laws. Critics also argue that the disclosure
requirements in the provision would unconstitutionally chill free
speech.
<p>Further, they argue, not all ads that mention federal
candidates within 60 days of an election can be presumed to be
campaign ads. A corporation or labor union might legitimately
wish to discuss some issue -- for instance, legislation pending
in Congress -- and mention a candidate in that context, without
any intent to influence an election. This provision would
require hard money subject to federal campaign finance limits to
be used for such issue speech, in violation, they say, of the
First Amendment.
<p>There are a number of answers to this argument.
<p>First, in further defining the scope of what constitutes a
federal campaign ad, the Snowe-Jeffords provision is extremely
narrowly tailored to ensure that only ads that are widely viewed
as campaign ads are subject to campaign finance laws. It applies
only to ads that are broadcast, that refer to a clearly
identified federal candidate and that are run in the 60 days
before an election. These are clear, narrow and bright line
tests.
<p>Second, the ability to speak is not banned or limited by the
provision. Any corporation or union, for example, can still
speak by using its PAC funds (which come from individuals) to pay
for such "electioneering communications." And a corporation or
union could use its treasury funds to pay for any ad on any issue
-- including any lobbying ad -- so long as it is run before the
60 day pre-election window or does not mention a federal
candidate if run within the window.
<p>Non-profit corporations can run such "electioneering ads"
during the 60-day period with their own funds, provided such
funds come from individuals and disclosure is made of the ad
expenditures and the large contributions to finance the ads.
<p>Third, the overbreadth argument -- the idea that an ad could
mention a candidate within 60 days of an election and, in fact,
be a legitimate lobbying communication, not an electioneering
communication -- is not fatal to the statute.
<p>Overbreadth of a statute does not, in and of itself, make the
statute unconstitutional unless it is "substantially overbroad"
-- unless the statute would repeatedly be used to suppress speech
that is not properly within its scope. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413
U.S. 601, 615 (1973). In Broadrick, the Supreme Court held that
overbreadth of a statute "must not only be real, but substantial
as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate
sweep." Id.
<p>Here, by contrast, Congress is entitled to make the
reasonable judgment that the overwhelming majority of broadcast
ads that refer to a federal candidate within the 60-day period
before an election do influence elections and are intended to do
so. Thus, even though it may be possible for some non-campaign
ads to fall within the 60-day time frame test, Congress can make
a reasonable determination that a clear bright-line test for this
period is not substantially overbroad and therefore is
constitutional.
<p>Finally, the Supreme Court has never said that only ads with
"magic words" can be subject to campaign finance laws. In
Buckley it formulated the "magic words" test in order to narrow
-- and save -- broad but vague language enacted by Congress. It
did not prohibit Congress from adopting a new definition of
campaign speech that does not suffer from the same infirmity of
vagueness. The bright-line time frame test in the Snowe-Jeffords
provision achieves this purpose. The test is not vague and there
is no question as to whether an ad falls within it or not.
