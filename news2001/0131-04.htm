- January 31 - The East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) today criticized the UN and
      its member states for their failure to act on the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/A.54.726,+S.2000.59.En" target="_blank">UN's
      international commission of inquiry</a> recommendation one year ago today
      to create an international tribunal for East Timor. Today also marks the
      first anniversary of the <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2000a/3exec.htm" target="_blank">report
      by the Indonesian Human Rights Commission (KPP-HAM)</a> which recommended
      the investigation and prosecution of high-ranking Indonesian military and
      political figures and East Timorese militia members.
<p>&quot;We are deeply disturbed that a year has passed since both
      inquiries and no steps have been taken to address these severe human
      rights abuses through an international tribunal and no one has been
      prosecuted in Indonesia,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for the
      East Timor Action Network/U.S.</p>
      <p>ETAN called on the United States government and other nations to
      actively support an international tribunal to prosecute those responsible
      for serious human rights abuses and crimes against humanity in East Timor
      not only in 1999 but going back to 1975 when Indonesia invaded the former
      Portuguese colony.</p>
      <p>&quot;We are extremely troubled that not one country in last week's
      open Security Council debate on East Timor mentioned a tribunal. An
      international tribunal is the only way to ensure that most victims of
      Indonesian military and militia violence in East Timor will see justice
      for crimes committed against them, allowing them to move forward with
      their lives and rebuilding their new nation,&quot; said Miller.</p>
      <p>&quot;Many analysts believe that the prospect of a tribunal will
      encourage Indonesian efforts to prosecute its generals and other
      high-level military and civilian personnel. Such a tactic is completely
      ineffective if the threat is left unspoken,&quot; Miller added.</p>
      <p>Charles Scheiner, National Coordinator of ETAN who recently returned
      from six weeks in East Timor, found overwhelming public support for a
      tribunal.</p>
      <p>&quot;Indonesian efforts to prosecute those responsible for East
      Timor's destruction are bound to fail because many East Timorese victims
      and witnesses are terrified of traveling to the country whose generals
      ordered the crimes against them. Their fears will prevent them from
      testifying against military and militia leaders who have enjoyed impunity
      for many years,&quot; said Scheiner. &quot;No matter how serious an
      Indonesian judicial process might be, justice cannot be achieved if
      witnesses fear to testify.&quot;</p>
      <p>Both Indonesian and UN prosecutorial efforts have proven inadequate. No
      Indonesian military personnel have been prosecuted for atrocities
      committed during 1999 either before and after East Timor's referendum.
      Last fall Indonesia amended its constitution, creating legal obstacles to
      prosecuting those responsible for past human rights abuses, especially
      those who gave orders.</p>
      <p>The defiant refusal of the Indonesian military to cooperate with UN
      investigations into the 1999 atrocities, as well as the many other
      practical and political obstacles, has convinced many Indonesian, East
      Timorese, and international organizations that an international tribunal
      is now the only viable option to bring to justice military and militia
      leaders responsible for atrocities in East Timor.</p>
      <p>UN prosecutions in East Timor are fraught with procedural and other
      problems. Scheiner attended the first day of the trial of Joao Fernandes
      in Dili District Court on January 10. He observed a lack of resources and
      professionalism in the prosecution, the defense, and the management of the
      court.</p>
      <p>&quot;If justice is to be achieved in East Timor, court procedures and
      due process should be of unquestionable integrity and the Dili District
      Court so far fails to meet even minimal standards for a fair trial,&quot;
      he concluded. Fernandes pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 12
      years.</p>
      <p>&quot;An international tribunal will also deter ongoing rights
      violations throughout Indonesia and promote reconciliation in East
      Timor,&quot; noted Miller. &quot;Without a tribunal only lower-level East
      Timorese militia members in East Timor are likely to face justice, while
      militia leaders remain unscathed and Indonesian military officers who gave
      the orders and designed the policies are free to retain positions of
      prestige and power in Indonesia.&quot;</p>
      <p>Both Indonesian and UN prosecutorial efforts have sharply limited their
      scope to a handful of better-known incidents.</p>
      <p>When the KPP-HAM issued its report, Indonesia's <a href="http://etan.org/et2000a/february/1-6/3etmust.htm">Attorney
      General Darusman Marzuki promised that it would take three to six months</a>
      to decide whether to file charges against military, militia and political
      leaders named in the report. Over a year later no charges have been filed.
      Marzuki, while continuing his investigation, faces opposition from
      politicians and others who view those who ransacked East Timor as national
      heroes.</p>
      <p>The UN International Commission of Inquiry on East Timor wrote in its
      January 31, 2000 report to the UN Secretary General: &quot;The
      intimidation, terror, destruction of property, displacement and evacuation
      of people [in 1999] would not have been possible without the active
      involvement of the Indonesian army, and the knowledge and approval of the
      top military command.&quot; The KPP-HAM investigation reached similar
      conclusions.</p>
      <p>The UN inquiry recommended that &quot;The United Nations should
      establish an international human rights tribunal consisting of judges
      appointed by the United Nations, preferably with the participation of
      members from East Timor and Indonesia.&quot;</p>
      <p>On August 30, 1999, the people of East Timor, defying threats and
      violence, turned out in record numbers to vote overwhelmingly for
      independence. Following the vote, Indonesian troops and their militia
      proxies destroyed some 70% of the country's infrastructure, killed more
      than 1500 people, and forced hundreds of thousands across the border into
      Indonesia where approximately 100,000 remain.</p>
      <p>Indonesia invaded neighboring East Timor on December 7, 1975, hours
      after a state visit to Jakarta by then President Gerald Ford and Secretary
      of State Henry Kissinger. According to human rights groups, one-third of
      the population -- more than 200,000 East Timorese -- was killed in
      subsequent years as the U.S. provided weapons and political support under
      both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>
      
<p><i>The East Timor Action Network/ U.S. (ETAN) was founded in November 1991
      to support East Timorese self-determination. ETAN now works for a peaceful
      transition to independence in East Timor. It has 28 local chapters
      throughout the U.S.</i></p>
