- December 3 - The fall of energy
giant Enron should trigger the end of electricity deregulation in
California and throughout the country, according to consumer
advocates with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
(FTCR). Enron's demise demonstrates the unnecessary volatility that
deregulation brought to the California energy system.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five years after promising to create a marketplace for cheap and
reliable power with 20 percent rate reductions assured by March of
2002, California's energy system is in a calamitous state. Under
deregulation power companies manipulated power supply, drove up
prices and, six times this year, forced rolling blackouts
throughout California. Prior to deregulation, electricity was sold
at a regulated price reflecting the cost of generating the power
plus a reasonable profit for the power producer. Under
deregulation, the market was supposed to take care of itself and,
freed from government regulation, save consumers money.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Enron's bankruptcy, after months of profiteering in California,
shows that our energy system needs adult supervision," said Doug
Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights. "The power companies that promised consumer
savings from deregulation acted like pigs at the trough and cannot
be trusted to take care of energy service."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enron's greed led to deregulation and greed killed Enron
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enron has been at the vanguard of transforming electricity
systems around the nation into an unregulated marketplace that
allows middlemen to buy and sell electricity like a commodity. The
attempt to create a market for the trading of this essential
service developed out of the greed of power companies and utilities
and was stoked by a host of Wall Street institutions, such as
analysts, investment firms and rating agencies who saw an
opportunity to profit off deregulation, according to FTCR.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California, the first state to implement deregulation was
financially devastated during the past 18 months as a small cartel
of energy companies, led by Enron, was able to use this new layer
between the production and distribution of electricity to make
billions of dollars by overcharging for power.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When we leave a service as vital to society as electricity in
the hands of unregulated companies like Enron, we become the
subject of those companies' greed," said Douglas Heller, consumer
advocate with FTCR. "Enron spearheaded a deregulation system that
added expenses but no consumer benefits. But they have been done in
by their own greed. The lesson from Enron's demise is that
electricity deregulation is a disaster and electricity systems need
oversight."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What happened in California?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last year, California electricity rates have increased
by as much as 40 percent, and the state is holding billions of
dollars in energy debt that will eventually add even more cost to
consumers. Also in 2001, California experienced six days of
rolling blackouts, the state's first statewide power curtailments
since World War Two.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Utilities in the state, which crafted the deregulation law, were
allowed to overcharge consumers approximately $23 billion for
electricity over the last five years as a result of the law. These
companies, however, felt the sting of deregulation when companies
like Enron began massively overcharging for electricity on the
wholesale market for power. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the state's
largest utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April
2001 and, in a move that consumer groups are challenging in federal
court, the state Public Utilities Commission secretly agreed to a
ratepayer funded $4.9 billion bailout of the second largest
utility, Southern California Edison.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What must be done?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to FTCR, states around the nation and the federal
government must halt plans to deregulate all aspects of the energy
production, transmission and distribution systems. In those states
where deregulation has already begun, there should be an immediate
freeze and oversight should be re-instated. Consumer advocates are
concerned that if deregulation moves forward, Enron's competitors
- Dynegy, Sempra, Duke, Reliant and Williams among only a few
others - will fill in the void left by the massive Enron. These
companies were overshadowed publicly by Enron's cocky corporate
demeanor, but they have been equally culpable in the price gouging
that devastated California, according to FTCR.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In California, the state should immediately seek to obtain
records from Enron to learn more about that companies' role was in
this year's unexplained energy shortages and to determine the
extent of Enron's overall involvement and influence in our energy
system. Under deregulation the state lost the ability to fully
identify who was buying and selling electricity, so it is not yet
known how much of an impact Enron's bankruptcy may have. Also
California ratepayers must be protected from paying the outstanding
charges that Enron claims to have against the state and the
utilities.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, the Governor should immediately renegotiate the
power contracts that the state signed with other energy companies
during while deregulation was wreaking havoc on the state. If power
companies will not agree to reasonable prices for power, the
Governor should seize the state's power plants to ensure that
California businesses and consumers are not subject to more
blackouts and price gouging.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With the demise of Enron and the decimation of the California
economy, politicians around the country must shore up or restore
regulatory controls at all points in the energy system," said
Heller. "When the result of an experiment is rolling blackouts,
higher consumer rates, one utility bailout, one utility bankruptcy
and the collapse of one of the nation's largest corporations, then
the experiment has failed."
</font>

against California's disastrous deregulation law and the energy
"crisis" that deregulation created earlier this year.</i></font></p>
