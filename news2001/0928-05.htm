<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- September 28 - A coalition of environmental and consumer groups today
sent a letter to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National
Research Council (NRC) requesting that they cease further changes sought by
General Motors Corp (GM) to its recent report on automotive Corporate
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.  The groups urged the cancellation
of a meeting planned for October 5, 2001 to re-open the Academy's recent
report.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The NRC can't seem to say &quot;no&quot; to General Motors,&quot; said Ann Mesnikoff,
Global Warming and Energy Representative for the Sierra Club. &quot;We're
calling on the National Research Council to stop allowing itself to be
manipulated by GM.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report on CAFE standards, released on July 31, 2001, found that
technology exists to safely improve the fuel economy of cars and light
trucks. Although the report was produced by a panel described by the New
York Times as consisting &quot;mainly of engineers and consultants who have
worked for the auto and oil industries, along with some economists and
retired oil executives,&quot; it was welcomed by environmental and consumer
groups because it concluded that we can move forward to increase fuel
economy with existing technologies that will curb global warming, save
consumers money at the gas pump, and reduce our dependence on oil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On August 22, 2001, the NRC held a closed-door meeting with four
representatives of General Motors and one from DaimlerChrysler. Following
that meeting, the NRC announced that it would hold an October 5 meeting to
discuss, and possibly alter the report, despite the fact that proper peer
review and evaluation of the report was completed before the report's
release.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A letter from Alliance to Save Energy, American Council for an Energy
Efficient Economy, the Center for Auto Safety, Natural Resources Defense
Council, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists, asks the NAS and
NRC to cease modifying the report and cancel the October 5 meeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just as General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have taken issue with the final
report, we also have identified problems, missed technologies, and flaws in
the analysis.  No doubt this report, or any report the NAS issues, is open
to criticism, but it is unprecedented that a dissatisfied interested party
would prevail upon the NAS to secure changes to a final report even under
the guise of clarifying language,&quot; reads the letter in part.</font></p>

William Colglazer<br>
Executive Committee<br>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">September 28, 2001</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Dr. Alberts and Mr. Colglazer:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We strongly object to the meeting the National Research Council plans to
hold on October 5, 2001 to discuss, and alter, the report entitled
Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards.   It is our understanding that this meeting is the result of an
August 22, 2001 closed-door meeting between National Research Council (NRC)
staff and four representatives of General Motors and one from
DaimlerChrysler -- parties that have a major economic interest in the
findings of the Academy.  This process is troubling.  It undermines the
objectivity of the Academy and the NRC and raises questions about the
finality of NRC Reports.  We request that the October 5th meeting be
cancelled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report the NRC released on July 31, 2001 was peer-reviewed and final,
subject to editorial correction.  The National Academies' Study Process
states:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*As a final check on the quality and objectivity of the study, the
Academies appoint additional independent experts with a range of views and
perspectives to review and comment anonymously on the draft report prepared
by the committee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*The review process is structured to ensure that the report addresses the
committee's charge and does not go beyond it; the findings are supported by
the evidence and arguments presented; the organization and exposition of
the report are effective and logical; and that the report is impartial and
objective. After revisions are made by the committee to satisfy the
institution's rigorous review process, the report is transmitted to the
agency that sponsored the study and released to the public. Names of the
principal reviewers are made public when the report is released.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*The reputation of the National Academies for objectivity, integrity,
independence, and competence is one of its most valuable assets. For this
reason, the procedures designed to ensure excellence apply to each study
undertaken and to each step of the study process.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The peer-review process took place in July and the report was revised prior
to the July 31st release.  Now, after the ex parte August 22, 2001 meeting
the NRC is improperly reconvening the CAFE committee and opening up the
report to further discussion and changes.  This violation of process
undermines the reputation of the Academy and its objectivity, integrity and
independence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The industry, including General Motors, has had an active, if not dominant,
role in the preparation of the report: various companies provided testimony
and their employees, representatives, and contractors participated in the
Committee process and its technical analysis. One of the peer-reviewers,
William Agnew, is retired from General Motors Research Laboratories.   We
are now very disturbed that the National Academy of Sciences and the NRC is
providing General Motors with further, undue influence over modifications
to the content and characterization of the fuel economy ranges included in
the final report the Committee issued to Congress and the public.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several of us have had conversations with Alan Crane, a staff member of the
NRC. Mr. Crane has stated that while the October 5th meeting will not yield
changes in the ranges of fuel economy improvements or &quot;break-even&quot; analyses
in the report, it will lead to changes in how those ranges are described.
The NRC has publicly stated that the auto industry's private communications
have already persuaded the NRC that report was overly optimistic.  We
understand that these concerns are now being addressed in the report as it
undergoes editorial revision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just as General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have taken issue with the final
report, we also have identified problems, missed technologies, and flaws in
the analysis.  No doubt this report, or any report the NAS issues, is open
to criticism, but it is unprecedented that a dissatisfied interested party
would prevail upon the NAS to secure changes to a final report even under
the guise of clarifying language. The Union of Concerned Scientists,
however, is prepared to present a technical criticism of the report should
the October 5 meeting take place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is appropriate for all sides to release their criticism of the report
publicly and in writing.  The October 5 meeting is inappropriate and raises
legal questions.  The charge to the NAS from Congress was to convene a
committee and finalize a report by July 1, 2001.  The CAFE Committee
completed its work and issued its report on July 31. The work of the CAFE
Committee is over and there is no basis for the NRC to convene a 10th
meeting of this Committee more than two months later.  Moreover, it is
highly improper for the NRC to effectively facilitate a critique,
instigated by the auto industry.  Any changes, beyond editorial changes,
made to the report or issued in a supplemental report or statement will be
unacceptable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In our view, any separate memo or other form of statement by the NRC or the
CAFE Committee on the topic of CAFE would constitute an improper extension
of the study and will be considered part of the Report.  In this regard, we
believe that the NRC has already violated the integrity of its process
through statements to the press and others since August 22.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report issued on July 31, 2001 must not be opened.  We strongly object
to the October 5th meeting and request that the NRC cancel the meeting and
that the report not be modified, even under the pretext of providing
clarifications or reinterpretation.</font></p>
