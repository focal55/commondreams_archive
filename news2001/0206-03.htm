- February 6 -  Once again, the National Rifle Association has demonstrated
its hypocrisy when it comes to supporting law enforcement. On
January 8, the New York Times profiled a successful gun lock
giveaway program in Maine. The program is sponsored by the
Maine Citizens Against Handgun Violence Foundation, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to research, education and awareness of
gun violence and gun safety issues in the state. The Foundation
purchases gun locks with private funds and distributes them free
of charge via local police agencies.
<p>On January 27, the Associated Press reported that the
National Rifle Association opposes the Maine gun lock giveaway
program.
<p>THE HYPOCRISY:
<p>In the AP article, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam is quoted
as saying that his organization is "not happy that law
enforcement officers who are paid with public money, with
taxpayers' money, are involved. They should not be working so
closely to an advocacy group."
<p>Yet the NRA supports Project HomeSafe, a gun lock giveaway
program run by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF),
a gun industry trade group closely aligned with the NRA. Like
the Maine program, Project HomeSafe relies on police
participation to distribute its locks. According to the
program's website, police involvement in the giveaway is
"critical to the success of the program" and "(p)olice
departments will manage the distribution of the gun locking
devices..." In June 2000, the NRA promoted the Project HomeSafe
program in a fax alert to its members.
<p>"The NRA's criticism of the Maine gun lock giveaway program
is the height of hypocrisy," said Handgun Control President
Michael Barnes. "The NRA criticizes the Maine gun lock giveaway
program, yet it actively promotes an almost identical program
sponsored by the gun industry. Obviously, the NRA objects to
the Maine program because the Maine Citizens Against Handgun
Violence Foundation's sister organization, Maine Citizens
Against Handgun Violence, supports common-sense gun laws. Like
a petulant child, the NRA only opposes a statewide gun lock
giveaway program that is successful without -- and despite --
its participation and approval."
<p>THE HUBRIS:
<p>The Associated Press article also reports:
<p>The NRA said it would have been more likely to support the
(Maine) program if it had been consulted before it began.
<p>"As the national expert on gun safety, we should have been
contacted," Arulanandam said.
<p>"Clearly, the NRA feels that law enforcement officials aren't
qualified to judge the merit of a gun lock giveaway program on
their own," said Barnes. "And the NRA calling itself 'the
national expert on gun safety' is so absurd, it's laughable.
This is an organization that believes children can be left
unattended with guns so long as they're told not to touch them.
This is an organization that promotes the absurd notion that the
more people we have walking our streets carrying hidden
handguns, the safer our society will be."
<p>THE IRONY:
<p>In October 2000, the gun industry had to suspend its Project
HomeSafe program after police departments in Tennessee found
that the program's locks were faulty and could easily be
defeated. The NSSF had to issue warnings to police departments
across the country that had received hundreds of thousands of
these defective locks for distribution. In January 2001, the
NSSF informed Project HomeSafe participants that it would be
working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to
replace the locks.
<p>"Given the fact that guns are exempt from the CPSC's
oversight and that the gun industry resists any attempts to
implement standards for its products," said Barnes, "I find it
ironic that the gun industry is working with the CPSC to replace
the faulty locks it distributed. We support the use of child
safety locks, but if gun manufacturers were truly concerned
about safety, they would be doing more than just giving away gun
locks. They should be putting integrated locks and other safety
devices on their products to make them childproof. They should
be working with the CPSC and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to institute industry-wide standards for firearms. If
the NRA and the gun industry really cared about reducing guns
deaths and injuries, they should be supporting legislation to
keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, rather
working against it.
<p>"The NRA's attitude toward the Maine gun lock giveaway is
disgraceful. It is an insult to the Maine Citizens Against
Handgun Violence Foundation, to the gun owners who are taking
advantage of the gun locks and to members of the Maine law
enforcement community who wholeheartedly support this program."
<p><i>Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974
by Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun
violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law
enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups
across the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and
local gun control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI
has over 500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it
the nation's largest citizens' gun control lobbying
organization. More information about HCI and its sister
organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be
found on our website at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">http://www.handguncontrol.org</a>.
