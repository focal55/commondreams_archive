- November 14 - Leaders from a diverse 
collection of constituency organizations today came together to 
launch the Make TANF Work! campaign, an unprecedented grassroots 
initiative aimed at repairing the gaping holes in the safety net 
left by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. The Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF) block grant, the product of the 1996 
legislation, is set for congressional reauthorization early next 
year. The Make TANF Work! campaign is an effort to redefine the 
political landscape and make the needs of all low-income families 
the centerpiece of welfare reform reauthorization. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Five years ago, some people were congratulating themselves on 
ending welfare as we knew it.&quot; said Deepak Bhargava, Director of 
the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support (NCJIS). &quot;Today, 
we are here to say-not this time. With TANF reauthorization, we 
are going to end welfare reform as they know it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the end, TANF did two things: it reduced caseloads, and then 
it raised new questions it cannot answer about poverty, the balance 
between work and family obligations, and immigration. Low-income 
workers were forced to choose between their incomes and their kids 
and sacrifice education and training to qualify for benefits. 
Immigrants lost access to a broad range of benefits. Welfare 
leavers are still in poverty and experiencing hardship. The Make 
TANF Work! campaign will seek to redefine TANF into a program that 
can answer those questions to the benefit of all low-income 
Americans. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Make TANF Work! campaign is convened by the NCJIS, a new 
coalition of 1000 grassroots organizations in 40 states advancing 
solutions to poverty at the state and national levels. The 
campaign will use TANF reauthorization as a springboard to launch 
a nationwide conversation about poverty. It proposes an agenda 
that turns TANF into a platform of opportunity for all low-income 
people, not just those now on welfare. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 1996 welfare law touched on nearly every poverty program 
in which the federal government has a role. The Make TANF Work! 
campaign will use the 2002 welfare reauthorization as an 
opportunity to reshape the architecture of poverty programs in 
America,&quot; said Bhargava. &quot;We are not going to re-fight the battle 
of 1996. We are organized to use the opportunities TANF has given 
us to deal with poverty in a comprehensive way.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recession that began earlier this year and accelerated 
dramatically since September 11 is going to be devastating for 
low-income people. A Recession Like No Other, a new report 
released today by NCJIS, shows that this will be the first economic 
downturn in recent memory in which millions of low-wage workers 
lack a safety net. The report is the first analysis that estimates 
how many families will fall through the widening holes in the 
nation's Unemployment Insurance, welfare and food stamps safety 
nets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, if the unemployment rate increases by two 
percentage points over August 2001 levels, the report estimates 
that an additional 3.4 million people will be pushed below the 
poverty line, and that the national poverty rate will increase from 
11.9 percent to 13.1 percent. The study finds that large numbers of 
families will not qualify for unemployment insurance, welfare or 
food stamps because of restrictive state policies, time limits, 
limited funding, and immigrant exclusions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCJIS also released a poll today (nationwide survey of 1,000 
registered voters conducted by The Feldman Group between July 30 
and August 2, 2001) showing that Americans overwhelmingly support 
overhauling the current &quot;work first&quot; welfare system in favor of a 
program that helps low-income families lift themselves out of 
poverty. This includes providing opportunities for education and 
training, allowing recipients to balance the competing demands of 
work and family life, and ensuring access to incomes that will lift 
low-income families above the poverty line. Among the poll's 
findings: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 67 percent of voters support reforming the current welfare 
system into one that helps people get the education and skills they 
need to move out of poverty. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 65 percent of voters favor &quot;stopping the clock&quot; on time 
limits for parents who are &quot;playing by the rules&quot; and doing 
everything the system requires. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 95 percent of voters support allowing people to fulfill their 
work requirement by seeking education and skills training. 75 
percent strongly approve of counting education and training towards 
work requirements. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 64 percent of voters support allowing parents with children 
under age 6 to stay at home and still receive benefits. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Make TANF Work! campaign also released its policy 
recommendations today for 2002 TANF reauthorization. The proposal 
completely reorients TANF, transforming it into an economic 
security program for all low income families. The recommendations 
include: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- &quot;Stopping the clock&quot; for families in compliance with federal 
requirements. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Suspending work requirements and time limits in areas of high 
unemployment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Counting education and training as work activity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Restoring TANF and other related benefits to immigrants. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Opening up TANF cash assistance and related benefits to two 
parent and low-wage working families. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Creating public jobs for families reaching time limits and 
those with limited work experience. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Reducing or eliminating work requirements for parents with 
young, sick or disabled children. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ending discrimination by requiring states to collect and make 
public data on their performance, broken down by race and 
ethnicity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCJIS is also proposing major changes in other safety net 
programs that are ill-equipped to serve low-income families. Among 
these are: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Unemployment Insurance system should be reformed to allow 
more low-wage and part-time workers to qualify and the number of 
weeks workers qualify to receive benefits should be extended from 
26 to 39. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Improve the food stamp program by increasing benefit levels, 
restoring benefits to immigrants and tearing down barriers to 
access. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increase the minimum wage by $1.50. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The progressive community looks to the next welfare debate 
with a new advantage: grassroots political savvy. In the last five 
years, grassroots groups throughout America have won tremendous 
victories at the state and local level on benefits, living wages, 
immigration, health care, and many other issues,&quot; said Bhargava. 
&quot;It's one of the great untold stories of the last few years, and 
the people behind it are prepared to add a new national chapter.&quot;
