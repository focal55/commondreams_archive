- July 18 - Americans believe stronger environmental protections lead to
economic growth and new jobs, according to a new poll conducted by Lake,
Snell, Perry and Associates, Inc.  The Sierra Club released the research
today as a Congressional committee considers curbing global warming and
saving energy by raising gas mileage standards for cars, SUVs and other
light trucks to 40 miles per gallon.  Although the auto industry claims
higher gas mileage standards would hurt the U.S. economy, most voters
surveyed believe stronger environmental policies help the economy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans see environmental protection and economic growth as two sides of
the same coin,&quot; said Debbie Sease, the Sierra Club's legislative director.
&quot;When we improve fuel economy standards, we'll create high-tech and
manufacturing jobs building cars and SUVs that don't guzzle gas.  Making
our cars and light trucks go farther on a gallon of gas is the single
biggest step we can take to curb global warming, save consumers money at
the gas pump and cut our dependence on foreign oil.  Better gas mileage is
a win-win for our environment and for our economy.  Automakers may claim
gas mileage hurts our economy, but Americans know better -- when we guzzle
gas, we only help OPEC economies.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite the assertions of the Bush Administration, the public believes a
strong economy and a healthy environment go hand-in-hand -- even though
they have increasing concerns about the stability of the economy,&quot; said
Celinda Lake, President of Lake, Snell, Perry and Associates, Inc.  &quot;Voters
not only reject the notion that our nation must choose between a strong
economy and a healthy environment, but they believe improving the
environment can actually create jobs and strengthen the economy.  By a
margin of more than three-to-one, people thought improving the environment
creates jobs and strengthens the economy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked about the relationship between the economy and the environment,
a strong majority of voters believe improving the environment can create
jobs and help the national economy.  Fifty-six percent of voters say
improving the environment creates more jobs and helps the economy, compared
to only 17 percent who say improving the quality of the environment slows
down economic growth and job creation.  Moreover, across the board,
Republicans, Independents and Democrats all say improving the environment
creates more jobs and helps the economy, over statements that environmental
protections have no effect or a negative effect on the economy. Union
members are even more likely than voters overall to believe that improving
the environment helps the economy; 64 percent of union members agree with
that statement, compared to 17 percent who say improving the environment
hurts the economy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Representative Edward Markey (D-MA) will offer an amendment to the
Energy Advancement and Conservation act to raise Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) standards to 40 miles per gallon for cars, SUVs and other
light trucks.  Markup on the amendment begins this afternoon in the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.</font></p>

  _______________________________________________________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Despite conventional wisdom and the assertions of the Bush/Cheney
  Administration, the public believes a strong economy and a health
  environment go hand-in-hand -- even though they have increasing concerns
  about the stability of the economy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  A recent national survey of registered voters The survey reached 1,000
  registered voters nationwide, ages 18 or older.  The survey was conducted
  between June 3-5, 2001.  The total margin of error for this survey is +/-
  3.1%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  A recent national survey of registered voters, conducted by Lake Snell
  Perry &amp; Associates for The Sierra Club, found that voters not only reject
  the notion that our nation must choose between a strong economy and a
  healthy environment, but they believe improving the environment can
  actually create jobs and strengthen the economy.  (The survey reached
  1,000 registered voters nationwide, ages 18 or older.  The survey was
  conducted between June 3-5, 2001.  The total margin of error for this
  survey is +/- 3.1%.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  This is despite the fact that voters see the economy declining and are
  divided over whether the economy today is personally characterized by
  increasing opportunity or increasing instability.  Forty-five percent of
  voters say they see increasing instability when thinking about the
  economy, compared to 41 percent who say they see increasing opportunity.
  Notably, women voters are more likely to associate the economy with
  instability than are men (48 percent to 42 percent, respectively), while
  men are more likely than women to associate the economy with opportunity
  (44 percent to 38 percent, respectively).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  There are differences by political affiliation as well, with Democrats
  and Independents seeing increasing instability (49 percent and 51
  percent, respectively) and Republicans seeing increasing opportunity in
  our economy (51 percent).  Additionally, voters ages 18 to 34 are the
  most likely to believe the economy holds increasing opportunity (51
  percent), while baby boomers ages 45 to 64 are the most likely to see
  increasing instability (51 percent).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  When asked about the relationship between the economy and the
  environment, a strong majority of voters believe improving the
  environment can create jobs and help the national economy.  Fifty-six
  percent of voters say improving the environment creates more jobs and
  helps the economy compared to only 17 percent who say improving the
  quality of the environment slows down economic growth and job creation.
  An additional 20 percent say there is no relationship between the
  environment and the economy and only 8 percent say none of the above or
  they are not sure about the relationship between the two.  Interestingly,
  there is no gender gap with 56 percent of both men and women say
  improving the environment creates jobs and helps the economy, although
  men are slightly more likely to say improving the environment hurts the
  economy than women (19 percent to 16 percent, respectively).  In fact,
  every demographic and geographic subgroup are more likely to believe
  improving the environment helps economic growth and job creation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Moreover, across the board, Republicans, Independents, and Democrats all
  say improving the environment creates more jobs and helps the economy
  over the other two statements.  Democrats are the most likely to believe
  that improving the environment helps the economy (69 percent) followed by
  Independents (54 percent).  However, a plurality of Republicans also
  believe a better environment means more jobs and a better economy (43
  percent), although they are the most likely to say that improving the
  environment slows job growth and hurts the economy (22 percent , compared
  to 14 percent for Democrats and 17 percent for Independents).
  Additionally, there is a gender gap among Republicans with Republican
  women 10 points more likely than Republican men to believe improving the
  environment helps our economy (48 percent to 38 percent, respectively).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Overall, most likely to believe a good environment means a good economy
  are voters with no religious affiliation (75 percent), Liberals (71
  percent), voters ages18 to 24 (70 percent), Democrats (69 percent),
  voters who disapprove of Bush's job performance (69 percent), minority
  male voters (65 percent), union members (64 percent), unmarried men (64
  percent), younger non-college educated voters (61 percent), Catholic
  voters (61 percent), and voters ages 25 to 29 (61 percent).  Many of
  these sub-groups are key target voters for the 2002 elections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  In contrast, not surprisingly, those most likely to believe improving the
  environment slows economic growth are Republican (22 percent) --
  especially Republican men (26 percent) and older Republicans (24
  percent), voters living in the South Central region (25 percent), voters
  ages 30 to 39 (23 percent), younger Independents (22 percent), and white
  upscale suburban voters (22 percent).  However, among all of these
  groups, by a 2 to 1 margin, voters still believe the economy is helped
  more than hurt by strong environmental policies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Furthermore, after hearing both sides of the debate, a majority of voters
  believe stronger environmental policies mean a stronger economy.
  Fifty-three percent of voters choose a statement that strong
  environmental policies create new jobs in technology and environmentally
  safe products which strengthens our economy and our quality of life over
  a statement that tough environmental laws cost us jobs and hurt our
  economy by forcing businesses to cut their workforce or go out of
  business (35 percent).  Just 10 percent say both, neither or not sure.
  While majorities of both men and women say the statement that stronger
  environmental policies means a stronger economy, there is a slight gender
  gap with women choosing the stronger environmental policies means a
  stronger economy statement by 21 points and men by 15 points.</font></p>
