<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 23 - The Democratic and Republican parties are raising larger amounts 
and higher proportions of soft money than ever before, according 
to a new study of campaign finance figures by the non-partisan 
Center for Responsive Politics.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fund-raising figures for the first six months of 2001 show that 
both parties intensified their efforts to raise soft money - 
the unlimited, largely unregulated contributions that campaign 
finance proposals currently pending in Congress threaten to ban 
or limit. Republican Party committees raised $65.8 million in 
soft money between January and June, more than double the soft 
money they raised over the same period in 1999, which marked 
the start of the presidential election cycle. Democrats raised 
$38.1 million in soft money in the first half of this year, a 
40 percent jump over 1999.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures show that the trend toward heavier party reliance 
on soft money has not slowed down since the record-breaking 2000 
elections. Soft money accounts for 54 percent of the Democrats' 
total so far in 2001 and 46 percent of the money raised by the 
Republicans. At this point two years ago, the Democrats had collected 
49 percent of their funds in soft money; for the Republicans 
it was 38 percent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard money fundraising - which must conform with contribution 
limits and prohibitions - was also up in 2001, but not by as 
much. Republicans collected $77.6 million in hard money, up 54 
percent from 1999; Democrats raised $31.9 million, an increase 
of just 14 percent from two years ago. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All told, Republicans took in more than twice as much as Democrats 
between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year, collecting $143.4 million 
to the Democrats' $70.0 million. The GOP total, undoubtedly boosted 
by having a Republican in the White House, was a 76 percent increase 
over their take during the first six months of 1999. Democratic 
fund-raising was also up - but to a lesser degree - by 27 percent 
over 1999.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The totals are based on fund-raising reports filed by the Democratic 
and Republican National Committees, as well as the parties' congressional 
fundraising arms in the House and Senate. The figures come from 
the Federal Election Commission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A complete look at party fund-raising for the 2002 elections 
can be found on the Center's Web site at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/index.asp" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/index.asp</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>LAWMAKERS' CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS ILLUSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES 
OF INCUMBENCY</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's analysis also shows that beating incumbents - never 
an easy proposition - is going to be tougher than ever in next 
year's mid-term elections, as House and Senate incumbents have 
built up huge war chests more than a year before Election Day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average House incumbent already has nearly $375,000 in the 
bank. Senate incumbents up for election in 2002 have an average 
of just over $1.0 million in cash on hand. That total includes 
the relatively paltry war chest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), 
who just announced he will not seek reelection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures show that Republican members of the House of Representatives 
out-raised their Democratic colleagues by an average of 18 percent 
in the first six months of this year. With the 2002 midterm elections 
fast approaching and control of the House likely up for grabs, 
Republicans raised an average of nearly $220,000 versus the Democrats' 
average of just over $186,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures are based on analysis of fundraising reports filed 
by members of Congress on July 31. They cover financial activity 
between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2001. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's other findings include the following:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who Raised the Most</b> - The House's most prolific fund-raiser over 
the first six months of this year was Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), 
with $1.7 million. Graham is a candidate for the Senate seat 
of Strom Thurmond (R), who is retiring at the end of the 107th 
Congress. On the Senate side, Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) led all 
others with $2.5 million raised. In 1998 Schumer defeated incumbent 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R) in one of the most expensive races ever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Most Cash on Hand</b> - Four of the five House members with the most 
money in the bank are Democrats: No. 1 Peter Deutsch of Florida 
($2.4 million), No. 3 Robert Menendez of New Jersey ($2.2 million), 
No. 4 Martin Meehan of Massachusetts ($2.1 million), and No. 
5 Lloyd Doggett of Texas ($1.8 million). They each have a leg 
up on any possible opponents in 2002.  Interestingly, none of 
the top five senators in terms of cash on hand are up for election 
next year: Charles Schumer of New York ($6.7 million), Richard 
Shelby of Alabama ($6.0 million), Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas 
($4.6 million), Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts ($3.8 million), 
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania ($3.4 million).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who Spent the Most</b> - The list of top spenders so far this year 
is rife with freshmen lawmakers who undoubtedly want to position 
themselves early on as strong contenders for re-election. The 
top three House spenders are all freshmen who won special elections 
this year: Randy Forbes (R-Va.), with nearly $1 million; Diane 
Watson (D-Calif.), with close to $865,000; and Bill Schuster 
(R-Pa.) at nearly $511,000. Two of the top three spenders in 
the Senate are freshmen: No. 1 Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), with 
just over $651,000, and No. 3 Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.) at nearly 
$555,000. No. 2 Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), who spent close to 
$645,000, is up for re-election in 2002 and is battling an investigation 
into alleged fund-raising improprieties during his 1996 campaign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Top Self-Funders</b> - Several lawmakers upped their fund-raising 
totals by lending or contributing personal funds to their campaign 
coffers. Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), who spent more than $60 million 
of his own money to win his seat last November, led all members 
of Congress in the first half of this year by reserving $238,000 
of his personal fortune for his campaign account. Also topping 
the six-figure mark were Sens. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), with 
nearly $157,000; Deborah Stabenow (D-Mich.), with close to $141,000; 
and Herb Kohl of (D-Wis.) at $100,000. Rep. Robin Hayes (R-N.C.) 
led all House members with $150,000 in personal funds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Totals were not included for members who have not yet filed their 
six-month reports with the FEC. The above figures and others 
are available on the Center's Web site at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/2002elect/storysofar/" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/2002elect/storysofar/</a>.
