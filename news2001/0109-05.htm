- January 9 - The following is a
statement by National Abortion Federation Executive Director Vicki
Saporta on nomination of John Ashcroft as US Attorney General:
<p>The National Abortion Federation is strongly opposed to the
confirmation of John Ashcroft for US Attorney General because of
our grave concern that he will not enforce the laws protecting
abortion providers and their patients. We fear an increase in the
levels of violence directed against the dedicated health care
professionals who provide safe, legal abortion services to women if
Ashcroft becomes the next Attorney General.
<p>We know firsthand how important the Justice Department is in
stemming the tide of violence against abortion providers. In
recent years, the Justice Department provided US Marshall
protection to abortion providers in the wake of extreme acts of
violence; placed two anti-choice terrorists on the FBI's Ten Most
Wanted list; participated in local law enforcement educational
programs on the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act;
and dispatched federal law enforcement officials to communities
where local law enforcement officials were not enforcing the law.
In the last two years since Janet Reno created the National Task
Force on Violence Against Reproductive Health Care Providers, NAF
has documented an overall decrease in extreme forms of anti-choice
violence. The actions of the Task Force have served as a deterrent
to violence and have saved lives.
<p>From our close to 25 years of collecting statistics on incidents
of violence and harassment against abortion providers, we know that
when laws are enforced, violence decreases. Conversely, when laws
are not enforced, violence in communities across the country
increases. We cannot tolerate another increase in violence because
an Attorney General refuses to vigorously enforce the law.
<p>Throughout his career, John Ashcroft has allowed his extreme
position on a woman's right to choose, which would outlaw abortion
even in cases of rape and incest, to influence almost every aspect
of the jobs he has performed, both in the state of Missouri and as
a US Senator. For a quarter century, he has consistently placed
the goal of banning abortion at the forefront of his legislative
agenda, and has even brought political retribution against those
who have opposed his extreme agenda.
<p>In Congress, he has successfully led the fights to defeat the
confirmations of those whose ideology he does not support. He has
stated, "Those who devalue life must not be placed in authority
over policies affecting our most vulnerable. I have repeatedly,
and in many instances alone, fought President Clinton's anti-life
nominations and appointments including activist federal judges and
Surgeon General nominees Henry Foster and David Satcher."
<p>During the time that Ashcroft served as a Senator, and a head of
the Republican Party in Missouri, a known anti-choice extremist,
Tim Dreste, was elected by Republican Party officials in Missouri
to the Missouri Republican State Central Committee, the
policy-making body of the party. That year, 1996, Dreste asked the
state GOP to add to its platform a murder penalty for abortion
providers. The state Republican Party also provided funds to
Dreste in his race for state representative. Dreste was finally
ousted from the state committee in 1999, after embarrassing the
committee by being one of the defendants who lost a federal lawsuit
in which the jury awarded $107 million in damages. Twelve
defendants, including Dreste, were found guilty of making illegal
threats. Dreste was cited for distributing "Wanted" posters of
abortion providers that threatened violence against them. Other
defendants in the case were tied to the Nuremberg Files website
which lists doctors' names, with lines through those who have been
killed by anti-choice extremists. Ashcroft only called on Dreste
to resign from the committee after being pressured to do so.
Additionally, Ashcroft's rhetoric on the subject of abortion
matches that of some of the most violent members of the anti-choice
movement.
<p>The dedicated women and men who risk their lives to provide safe
reproductive health care to women deserve nothing less than an
Attorney General who will vigorously enforce the laws of the land.
Our examination of John Ashcroft's record leads us to conclude that
his extreme ideology has rendered him unable to fulfill that
mission.
<p>We urge all Americans, regardless of their position on a woman's
right to choose, to oppose Ashcroft's confirmation as Attorney
General because his extremist views are out of touch with
mainstream America and would interfere with his vigorous
enforcement of the law.
<p><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional association
of abortion providers in the US and Canada dedicated to ensuring
that abortion remains safe, legal and accessible.
