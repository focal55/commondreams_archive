- June 7 - On June 6 and 7, the Indonesian government conducted a procedure throughout 
the refugee camps in West Timor. One stated objective was to allow each 
family to choose whether to be resettled in Indonesia or to return to East 
Timor, their homeland from which they were forcibly abducted 21 months ago. 
However, this process was ill-conceived, illegitimately executed, and 
conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation without meaningful oversight or 
participation by the international community. The results of the 
registration must therefore be rejected, no matter how much the two-day 
process appeared to be smooth and free of civil disturbance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The approximately 80,000 refugees languishing in squalid refugee camps 
urgently need the international community to help provide for their 
immediate needs and to ensure that they can freely choose whether to 
repatriate to East Timor or resettle in Indonesia. The United Nations 
conducted the 1999 election, while leaving security in the hands of the 
Indonesian military, thereby creating the conditions which forced these 
refugees from their homeland, and the U.N. should acknowledge its 
responsibility to enable them to rebuild their lives. This week&#146;s exercise 
was totally inadequate, and we reiterate our call for a genuine, 
internationally-conducted registration conducted after the militia 
organizations have been disarmed, disbanded, prevented from pressuring the 
refugees, and not involved in future registrations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intimidation by the Indonesian military and the militias they created has 
been a fact of life for the refugees since before they were evicted from 
East Timor nearly two years ago. That alone invalidates this week&#146;s 
process, and the international community should be ashamed of allowing it 
to proceed under these conditions. The following are specific points which 
demonstrate the fraudulent nature of the Indonesian government&#146;s refugee 
registration:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Intimidation</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Indonesia brought an additional 4,500 military from other parts of 
Indonesia to West Timor to enforce order during the registration. These 
soldiers, operating under shoot-to-kill orders, recall the 24 years of 
Indonesian military occupation of East Timor which resulted in 200,000 East 
Timorese deaths and which was resoundingly rejected in the August 30, 1999 
referendum. The impunity enjoyed by military officers and militia leaders 
who committed crimes against humanity in East Timor from 1975 to 1999, and 
in West Timor since then, allows them to continue terrorizing East Timorese 
refugees. Reports, including those from Indonesian authorities, describe 
militias forcing people either to &#147;vote&#148; for resettlement or not at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Militia members and camp coordinators in several camps told 
refugees that those who opt for repatriation would be kidnapped instead of 
being allowed to return to East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Only a handful of foreign journalists went to West Timor to cover 
the registration. If well-protected and highly visible reporters were not 
brave enough to venture into the territory, what does it say about the 
climate of fear for refugees who live there under continuous scrutiny of 
pro-integration armed men, under the control of militia and Indonesian 
soldiers?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Distortion and lack of information about the process</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       The very nature of the process was confusing to all. Was this a 
count of the refugee population, a poll to determine what percentage 
planned to repatriate, a re-vote of the 1999 referendum, or an individual 
choice by each person to return or resettle? One thing was clear  the 
Indonesian authorities, and therefore the militia leaders, will know how 
each person &#147;voted.&#148; In many cases, registrants displayed their marked 
ballots or marked the ballot without going into the private booth, proving 
that they had chosen the red-and-white.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Posters explaining the process were not displayed in the Kupang and 
TTS district camps, but only 200 m outside, and only for 1-2 days before 
the registration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       UNTAS (Uni Timor Aswain, pro-integration coalition which includes 
the militias) worked closely with the Indonesian authorities, &#147;translating&#148; 
official registration information from Bahasa Indonesia to Tetum for the 
refugees. For example, in a Noelbaki camp meeting on 2 June, UNTAS people 
stressed to the refugees that now was the time for the refugees to show how 
much they love the red and white (Indonesian flag colors).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       In Tuapukan camp (and perhaps elsewhere), an official told refugees 
the registration was not just going on in West Timor, but also in East 
Timor. He said that the process was a re-administration of the 1999 
referendum, and that East Timor will again become part of Indonesia if more 
people there East Timor wanted to live in Indonesia than an independent 
East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Coercion</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       A pervasive, systematic campaign of disinformation has been 
underway for months to make the refugees believe that East Timor is filled 
with starvation, vigilante retaliation against pro-integration people, 
shortages, and other hardships and dangers. Militias have organized visits 
to camps by refugees from other areas in West Timor who pretend to report 
on terrible conditions in East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Although Indonesian authorities did not distribute rice and 
monetary allowances to refugees for the past three months, they distributed 
rice in at least two camps just hours before the registration. They 
promised more rice after registration was completed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ubiquitous irregularities</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       There are widespread reports of West Timorese locals 
misrepresenting themselves as East Timorese refugees and registering, often 
for money (Rp. 100,000 is typical) or because they were told they would 
receive food if they registered, as part of an effort to increase the 
numbers registering and the percentage choosing resettlement in Indonesia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Nobody under 17 years old was allowed to register. Consequently, 
adult men decided for all people in their households (often telling adult 
women how to register) whether to repatriate or remain in Indonesia. Many 
families were systematically divided by militia in September 1999 when they 
were taken to West Timor, and most refugee children are being cared for by 
adults from their village who ended up in the same camp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       There were only 12 international observers for 507 registration 
sites, and they visited each site, with military escort, for only a brief 
time. West Timorese humanitarian and human rights NGOs who wanted to 
observe the registration were denied credentials.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       At some sites, there was not enough indelible ink to mark 
registrants&#146; hands, and stamp-pad ink was used instead. This allowed people 
to wash it off with water and register a second or third time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       At many sites in Tuapukan and Noelbaki, among others, registration 
staffers could not speak Tetum and were unable to explain the process or 
answer questions asked by registrants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       A news report quoted the registration organizing committee&#146;s media 
center that 9,226 out of 9,533 voters chose resettlement, with only 277 
choosing repatriation. Not only is 97% choice for resettlement wildly 
inconsistent with the experience of anyone who has spoken with the 
refugees, but the total number is perhaps one-fourth of the number of adult 
refugees. On the other hand 140,000 ballots were distributed, several times 
what would be needed to register all the adult refugees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       The registration was rushed to meet UNTAET&#146;s timetable for August 
30 Constituent Assembly elections in East Timor, for which voters are 
required to register by June 20. Both timetables are unrealistic and do not 
allow sufficient time, given the necessary political will, for West Timor 
to conduct a refugee registration free of intimidation, followed by 
repatriation of those who wish it, followed by civic education and voter 
registration for East Timor&#146;s first election.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are deeply disturbed that the United Nations is participating in this 
sham refugee registration by providing funds and an observer, and that 
UNTAET declared that the process appears successful merely because little 
violence was initially reported on the first registration day. As the calm 
East Timor voting day of August 30, 1999 vividly demonstrated, the military 
and militia can turn their violence off and on. If no major incident occurs 
while West Timor is under international scrutiny for a few days, that says 
nothing about prior intimidation or subsequent retaliation which is the 
experience and the terror of the East Timorese refugees and inevitably 
influences their decisions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For all these reasons, the refugee registration process conducted by 
Indonesia this week must be soundly rejected. The United Nations and the 
international community have accepted Indonesia&#146;s hollow promises and 
dangerous charades too many times  and left the East Timorese people to 
bear the bloody consequences. This time, they must do better.
