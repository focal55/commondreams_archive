- June 6 - The world is on the brink of climate chaos if the US President George W. Bush succeeds with his outrageous plan to abandon the Kyoto Protocol (international agreement on climate change and global warming), says Greenpeace International's new Executive Director Dr Gerd Leipold.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking from Brussels, Belgium, where his new position was announced today, Dr Leipold said that the EU and the great majority of the world's countries must ratify the protocol to take the big step towards the long road to saving the climate and the world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a deadline. In little more than five weeks the world's leaders will gather in Bonn, Germany. There they face the challenge they failed to meet last November in The Hague, The Netherlands, and that is to agree on implementation measures of the protocol on climate change. Or to put it in simple terms to make it work,&quot; he said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush's announcement in late March this year that the US was abandoning the protocol was met by a storm of international and US protest. Governments, scientists, religious leaders, labour and other public figures, as well as environmental organisations, condemned the move. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US was seen as abandoning its moral, political and legal responsibility to work internationally to address the most pressing international environmental problem of the 21st century - global climate change. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The new Administration in the US has greatly hardened its position. President Bush and his corporate allies want to abandon the protocol altogether,&quot; Dr Leipold said. &quot; This amounts to a crime against the climate and the global environment. Let's not forget people's lives and their livelihoods are also endangered. Rising sea levels, floods, changing weather patterns bring devastating impact and they will not be prevented by the protocol.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a former ED of the German office, a long time campaigner and member of many Greenpeace boards, Dr Leipold (who is a scientist by training and German by birth) will also be pushing other Greenpeace campaigns during his time as executive director. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace International Board Chair Dr Anne Summers said that Dr Leipold brought to Greenpeace a wealth of campaign experience in addition to his strategic and organisational skills. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Under Gerd's leadership, Greenpeace will reinvigorate its international campaigning to save the environment and also prevent the proliferation of nuclear power and weapons,&quot; she said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are especially pleased that one of his major priorities will be to lead the fight against climate change, an issue that is urgent for global survival.&quot; Greenpeace will remain true to its core values of non-violent direct action with Gerd at the helm,&quot; Summers said, &quot;but at the same time he will bring innovation and imagination to our high-profile international campaign and political work.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Statement by New Greenpeace International Executive Director Dr Gerd Leipold </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brussels, Belgium: 6 June 2000: It is a great pleasure to be here as the new Executive Director of Greenpeace and to speak about the most important issue facing the world -Climate change. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a deadline. In little more than five weeks the world's leaders will gather in Bonn, Germany. There they face the challenge they failed to meet last November in The Hague, The Netherlands, and that is to agree on implementation measures of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Or to put it in simple terms to make Kyoto work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hague talks collapsed as a result of pressure from the US. The new Administration in the US has greatly hardened its position. President Bush and his corporate allies want to abandon Kyoto altogether. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This amounts to a crime against the climate and the global environment. Let's not forget: people's lives and their livelihoods are endangered. Rising sea levels, floods, changing weather patterns bring devastating impact and they will not be prevented by the Kyoto Protocol.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has always said that Kyoto does not go far enough and we maintain this position. Scientists tell us that we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 - 80 percent if we are to stop climate change. But we also say that Kyoto is better than nothing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kyoto is a vital first step. Scrapping it would set climate protection back by at least 10 years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next week President George Bush is making his first visit to Europe. We are waiting for him. In the next five weeks, we will let him know what we think of him. We'll be doing that, knowing we have the support of millions around the world. We are also taking political action. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We're putting pressure on companies, informing our supporters, and we will be doing what Greenpeace does best - direct action against climate criminals. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the political level we will continue to remind European governments to stand firm on Kyoto. We demand that the EU takes the lead at the Gothenburg summit on 15 June 2001. We want the EU to agree to ratify the Kyoto Protocol with or without the US. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomorrow I will go to Luxembourg where the European Environmental Ministers are meeting. I will be reminding them where public opinion in Europe stands on climate. I will be pointing out that their example will influence other nations. And I will express our support and sympathy, because most of them are willing to take action. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is another significant group that needs to change too - US Corporations. We have already begun lobbying US corporations with a lot of influence over President Bush. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several weeks ago, we launched our Corporate 100 campaign. Greenpeace sent letters to each of the Fortune 100 firms. We simply asked whether they agreed that climate change was an urgent environmental problem and that they supported the ratification of Kyoto. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To date, we received more than 30 responses. But what they had to say was disappointing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The top oil companies Exxon Mobil, Texaco, Chevron, Conoco and Phillips all oppose the protocol. Most others don't want to take a position on Kyoto. However, most agree about the need to adress climate change and they are worried that climate change may be decided at the market place, literally at the fuel pump. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many corporations will soon have to decide what matters more: success with consumers or support of an extremist politician. Of course, we will also be launching actions against specific targets in the next five weeks. You would not expect details from me about these actions, but you will see for yourselves soon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace takes climate change very seriously. We know, the fight will last for many years to come. For the next five weeks, however, Greenpeace will fight especially hard. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are at a crossroads. If President Bush succeeds with his outrageous plan the world leaps onto a rapid slide into climate chaos. The European Union and the great majority of the world's countries must ratify the Kyoto Protocol to take a big step forward on the long road to saving the climate and the world. </font></p>
