- April 11 - The Bush administration has taken direct aim at Noah&#146;s ark in its latest attack on the environment. Instead of asking Congress to adequately fund the US Fish and Wildlife Service&#146;s division that enforces the Endangered Species Act the administration is seeking to strip key provisions from the Act to make it cheaper to administer. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This move could push hundreds of American species closer to the edge of extinction in the coming year. The Bush changes could keep the New England cottontail rabbit, along with hundreds of other American species, from getting federal protection, ironically on the eve of the Easter weekend. The administration proposal is likely to benefit developers, timber companies, mining corporations, and other special interests with ties to the administration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We came very close to wiping out the American bison, the bald eagle, the wolf, and the grizzly bear,&quot; said Earthjustice executive director Buck Parker. &quot;Now the Bush administration is happy to stand by and deny a host of American birds, animals and plants the protection they desperately need and deserve.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill&#146;s changes would affect hundreds of species at various stages of ESA review. This includes some 249 species currently awaiting review by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The proposed level of funding from the administration doesn&#146;t come close to giving the Fish and Wildlife Service what they need to handle the problem &#150; twice as many as the 80 people nationwide currently working on it. More ominously, the bill would also suspend parts of the Endangered Species Act that compel the government to act in a timely manner in dealing with America's vanishing species. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We don&#146;t have the luxury of time when trying to save vanishing species,&quot; said Earthjustice attorney Todd True. &quot;Every day more land is paved over, more of America&#146;s forests are mowed down, and more of America&#146;s waterways are polluted and diverted. Americans care about the natural world around us in this great land of Lewis and Clark, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. We have to act now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, the bill would drop several important deadlines currently contained in the ESA. Dropping the deadlines would neutralize one of the key tools citizen activists have used to move ESA compliance along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the last decade, due to political pressure from industries, few species have made it onto the list without deadline enforcement by citizens,&quot; said Earthjustice attorney Mike Sherwood. &quot;Bush's proposals would make listing decisions voluntary by removing the law's deadlines. And it would leave the notoriously anti-ESA Gale Norton to decide which species deserve to live and which would be too expensive to save. That is like deciding that it is okay for 10 or 15 or 100 rivets to fall out of a jet airliner before it needs to be taken in for repair. Who is to say which is the rivet that will make the plane crash to the ground?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One deadline forces the government to respond within 90 days after receiving a petition to &quot;list&quot; a species. Another forces the government to issue a &quot;proposed determination&quot; within 12 months of receiving a listing petition. A third deadline compels the government to make a &quot;final determination&quot; within 24 months of receiving the petition. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet another deadline that is being dropped says the government has to designate critical habitat at the time of listing a species. This means the government has to determine the actual real estate that is critical for the species to recover. Typically the government asks for and receives a one-year extension to designate critical habitat. This deadline also gets dropped under the Bush proposal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Historically the government has failed to add species deserving protection to the ESA list and has only done so when forced to by citizen groups. Ninety-two percent of all species listed in California during the last nine years were as a result of citizen petition and court order. The government has typically failed to designate critical habitat within the time prescribed in the ESA and typically does so only after court orders instigated by citizen groups. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush proposal will shut out regional citizen groups who want to protect their local wildlife,&quot; said Mike Sherwood. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush proposal would start a new rule-making process aimed at establishing a hierarchy of which species would get attention under a limited FWS budget. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT CRITICAL HABITAT AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is the Endangered Species Act? <br>
The federal Endangered Species Act (&quot;ESA&quot;) is the basic federal law that protects endangered and threatened species. Among other things, it prohibits federal agencies from authorizing, funding or carrying out any action that destroys or adversely modifies the &quot;critical habitat&quot; of any threatened or endangered species. This prohibition is necessary to achieve one of the central goals of the ESA: the preservation of the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend for their continued survival and recovery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is critical habitat? <br>
The ESA defines &quot;critical habitat&quot; as those geographical areas: (1) that are essential for bringing an endangered or threatened species to the point where it no longer needs the legal protections of the ESA; and (2) which may require special management considerations or protection. In other words, the critical habitat consists of those areas that must be managed to permit an endangered or threatened species to recover to a level where it is safe, for the foreseeable future, from the danger of extinction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How is critical habitat determined? <br>
Under the ESA, the Secretary of the Interior (&quot;Secretary&quot;) has the responsibility for identifying those areas that are critical habitat for endangered and threatened plants and animals. Generally speaking, the Secretary must designate this critical habitat at the same time that the species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Secretary has delegated this task to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (&quot;Service&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In determining the critical habitat for a species, the Service is required to use the best scientific data available. In addition, before designating any particular area as critical habitat, the Service must consider the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, associated with this designation. If the costs associated with designating an area as critical habitat outweigh the benefits, the Service may exclude that area from critical habitat, unless excluding the area would result in the extinction of the species in question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How does critical habitat designation affect private landowners? <br>
Critical habitat designation has little impact on private landowners since it is directed solely at federal agency action. Critical habitat designation affects an activity on private land only if the participation, funding or approval of a federal agency is needed to carry out the activity. In those cases, the private landowner can carry out the proposed activity as long as it would not adversely modify or destroy the critical habitat of species.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Can the public participate in the process for designating critical habitat?<br>
Yes. At least 90 days before making a final decision on the designation of critical habitat for a species, the Secretary must publicize the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in each area where the species is believed to occur. The public is then free to request a public hearing on the proposed critical habitat designation. This hearing must take place within 45 days after the Federal Register notice is published.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is the Bush administation proposing? <br>
Make listing decisions voluntary by removing the law's deadlines. In the last decade, due to political pressure from industries, few species have made it onto the list without deadline enforcement. Impact thousands of declining species not yet on Noah's Ark but currently petitioned for listing, and prevent critical habitat protection for the more than 800 species already listed, but still without critical habitat. Shut out regional citizen groups who want to protect their local wildlife.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What would it take to solve the crisis? <br>
FWS says $80-120 million over 5 years (just $16-24 million/year) to deal with the huge backlog of candidate species, listing petitions, and critical habitat designations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is the language that has caused the uproar?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the FWS budget justification:<br>
Provided further, That notwithstanding the specific time frames and deadlines of section 4 (a) and (b) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, not to exceed $8,476,000 shall be used for implementing subsections (a), (b), (c)(1), (c)(2)(B)(iii) and (e) of section 4 for species that are indigenous to the United States, to be expended solely for (1) complying with court orders or settlements in effect as of the date of the passage of this law, and (2) undertaking such other actions as determined by the Secretary to be consistent with the priorities established by a listing priority system to implement these subsections and subject to the requirements of this appropriation:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This language is aimed at ensuring limited listing funds are directed towards activities that provide the greatest benefit for species at risk of extinction. Under the citizen suit provision of the ESA, failure to meet a listing requirement can quickly result in a court order requiring the Service to act. It is rather simple, therefore, for a plaintiff to file a suit to make the species or action of their concern a priority for the listing program, regardless of the resources available or the needs of other species. In 2001, nearly all of the listing budget will be expended on compliance with existing court orders and court-approved settlement agreements. For the most part, Courts have found that they have no discretion to give the Service relief from certain underlying mandatory deadlines in the ESA, even when the limited listing funding will not allow the Service to meet all of the ESA listing requirements. As a result, the listing program is operated in a &quot;first to the courthouse&quot; mode, as opposed to a rational system that prioritizes funding towards providing the greatest protection for the species at the greatest risk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001, the Service has essentially no ability to direct listing resources to the listing actions most urgently needed to conserve species, or to respond to new court orders. The Department expects this situation will be further exacerbated in 2002; the proposed language will assist in moving towards a rational system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, this language does the following:<br>
The language establishes a discrete appropriation, or limit, of $8,476,000 for carrying out the following aspects of ESA: <br>
- Decisions whether to list a species as threatened of endangered;<br>
- Critical habitat designations; <br>
- Processing petitions regarding listings or critical habitat designations; <br>
- Revising and publishing the lists of threatened and endangered species; and <br>
- Administrative costs (including litigation support) related to the activities listed above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When appropriations are not sufficient to meet ESA requirements, the language allows the Secretary to prioritize which actions she will complete notwithstanding the specific mandatory time frames and deadlines, including:<br>
- The requirement to designate critical habitat concurrently with listing of a species, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. <br>
- The requirement to determine to the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to list a species or revise a critical habitat designation whether the petition presents substantial information indicative that the action is warranted. <br>
- The requirement to determine within 12 months of receiving a petition that presents substantial information whether the petitioned action is warranted, and if so, to promptly publish a proposed listing or notice of intention regarding the critical habitat designation. <br>
- The requirement to publish a final listing or critical habitat rule within one year of the proposal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The language therefore essentially suspends the deadlines with respect to actions that are assigned a lower priority and will not be completed during the fiscal year if appropriations are insufficient to meet all of the deadlines. However, with respect to those actions that the Secretary decides to undertake during the fiscal year because they have a high priority, the statutory deadlines will remain in effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The language requires funding to be allocated to comply with existing court orders and settlement agreements, and to other actions based on a listing priority system established by the Secretary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without the ability to prioritize the Service's listing workload, the conservation of many imperiled species may be permanently impaired as needed conservation actions are delayed. Since reviewing courts have generally been unwilling to take into account the resources available to the Service or the importance of prioritizing the listing workload, the Service believes the best option is to suspend these deadlines with respect to lower priority actions until the listing program can again be managed by a rational prioritization process. This language will enable the Service to work through the substantial work load resulting from the current court orders and settlements, and establish a prioritization system that will not be subsumed by future court orders or settlements, but rather will allow them to be rationally prioritized with all other needed conservation actions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Establishing a priority system for listing actions is essential to the effective and efficient implementation of the listing program, and is fundamental to furthering the purposes of the ESA. A priority system provides guidance for addressing the various listing activities. It is long-standing Service policy that highest priority be given to those species believed to face the greatest threat of extinction. However, the overwhelming volume of litigation has currently rendered such a prioritization system impossible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A priority system will help in ensuring funds are directed towards activities that provide the greatest benefit for species at risk of extinction. This goal will be further advanced as a priority system will:<br>
- Allow the Service to schedule actions to maximize efficiency, including completing multiple species actions concurrently, as opposed to the piecemeal approach required under litigation;<br>
- Maximize the productivity of personnel and other resources by coordinating listing activities, as opposed to the current environment of changing direction as a result of litigation.<br>
- Ensure adequate public participation in the listing process, which is often the first thing to be compromised under tight litigation deadlines.<br>
- Reduce the portion of the listing budget allocated to litigation support.</font></p>
