- May 16 - As President Bush prepares to travel to Minnesota to
present his plan to address the future energy needs of the nation, U.S. Senator
Paul Wellstone (D-MN) today joined Senator Mark Dayton to issue a strong
challenge in a letter to the President to restore deep cuts in his budget to
Renewable Energy Funds vital to Minnesota's future economic growth.  The Bush
budget for 2002 slashes funds from the Department of Energy's programs for
renewable energy research into clean sources like wind and solar power, ethanol
and biodiesel by 50%, at the same time the President is calling for
government-backed fossil fuel exploration and power plant building.   Wellstone
also pressed the President to make a firm commitment to increasing the nation's
use of clean ethanol and biodiesel to meet 3% of the nation's motor fuel market
within ten years -  providing energy, environmental and economic benefits for
the nation and Minnesota</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The big oil companies don't want our country to move to  renewable energy
development.  They support more drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
and the weakening of environmental, health and safety standards.  Minnesota is a
cold-weather state at the wrong end of the fossil fuels pipeline; we import
nearly all of our energy today.  Reducing our dependence on unsustainable fossil
fuels will take far-sighted policy, and  Minnesota can help lead the way.  The
future for our economy in Minnesota is clean, efficient, renewable energy, and
if the President is coming here to talk about energy policy, he has to
reconsider his budget cuts in this area, and make a real commitment on renewable
energy.&quot; Wellstone said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minnesota is a leader in the development of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel
and ethanol, which are increasingly important sources of transportation fuel in
the country.   Today, ethanol production in Minnesota is over 250 million
gallons a year.  As Minnesota's 14 farmer-owned cooperatives continue to invest
in value-added processing, ethanol production will rise to well over 300 million
gallons by the end of this year.  Minnesota's increased production and use of
ethanol and biodiesel boosts energy, environmental and economic public policy
goals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wind power in Minnesota, for example, currently producing electricity for 3 to 6
cents per kilowatt-hour, is competitive with the cost of electricity from a new
coal-fired power plant. Through additional investment the price could reach 2.5
cents a kilowatt hour within the next few years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's budget cuts funding for renewable energy development next year
by 50 percent, but he has an opportunity to restore these cuts in his Energy
Task Force Report on Thursday.   Given the current energy price crisis in our
country, investments in renewable energy development have never been more
important, particularly in our state.  Renewable energy development promotes
keeping capital investments in Minnesota, rather than continuing to spend $6
billion each year to import coal, oil and nuclear fuel.  Renewable energy
production also boosts  our rural communities, who continue to suffer under a
depressed farm economy,&quot; Wellstone said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone also challenged Bush to make a substantive commitment to the largely
untapped energy produced by America's farmers: ethanol and biodiesel.  It would
decrease the need for imported petroleum products, help improve air quality
across the country by reducing carbon monoxide and other toxic emissions, and
provide an important economic stimulus to rural America. A 3% market share for
ethanol and biodiesel, which Wellstone is pushing, would replace about 9 billion
gallons of gasoline annually or between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels of crude oil
each day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May 15, 2001</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
The Honorable George W. Bush<br>
President of the United States<br>
The White House<br>
Washington, DC 20500</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. President:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In advance of your appearance in Minnesota this week to announce the
Administration's energy proposals, we are writing to  urge you strongly to make
a substantive commitment to energy conservation, as well as to renewable energy
development and funding. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your Budget for fiscal year 2002 proposed cutting federal funding for renewable
energy research and development by 50 percent, and it proposed cutting funding
for energy conservation research and development by 46 percent. It further
proposed cutting by 48 percent the federal energy management program, which
seeks both to conserve energy and to reduce federal costs through &quot;advancing
energy and water conservation&quot; in the government's own buildings, vehicles and
operations. You now have an opportunity to recommend restoring these cuts
through the Vice President's task force report. We hope you will do so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investments in conservation and renewable energy development have never been
more important, particularly for a state such as Minnesota, which is situated at
the consuming end of the pipeline for non-renewable fossil fuels.  Contrary to
the widely reported suggestion by the Vice President that conservation is little
more than &quot;a sign of personal virtue,&quot; a recent report by scientists at our
national laboratories concluded that improved energy efficiency could reduce
growth in electricity demand by nearly 50 percent. Furthermore, wind power in
Minnesota, currently producing electricity for three to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, is competitive with the cost of electricity from new coal-fired
power plants, which  appear to be favored by the Vice President's task force.
Through additional research and development investments, it has been estimated
that the price of Minnesota wind power could go as low as 2.5 cents a kilowatt
hour within a few years. Development of such renewable energy sources promotes
keeping capital investments in Minnesota, rather than continuing to rely on the
importation of what is now approximately $6 billion worth of coal, oil and
nuclear fuel each year.  Renewable energy production from wind and biomass also
helps boost Minnesota rural communities economically. Creating jobs in
home-grown, forward-looking, innovative industries is key to the prosperity of
Greater Minnesota, where the farm economy continues to struggle under low
commodity prices and poor federal agriculture policy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minnesota is a national leader in the development of renewable fuels, such as
biodiesel and ethanol - increasingly important sources of transportation fuel.  
Ethanol production in Minnesota already exceeds 250 million gallons a year.  As
the state's 14 farmer-owned cooperative ethanol plants continue to invest in
value-added processing, production is expected to top 300 million gallons this
year.  Ethanol and biodiesel fuels reduce dependence on imported petroleum
products, improve air quality and help revitalize the rural economy. As in the
separate, bipartisan letter sent to your Administration today by a number of
Senators, we again urge you to include among your proposals a recommendation to
utilize biofuels to meet at least 3 percent of the nation's motor fuel market
within 10 years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We understand that these recommendations may not be looked upon favorably by
oil, coal or utility industry leaders. However, we believe they are central to
any forward_looking and balanced long_term energy strategy. Clean supply_side
technologies should be combined with conservation to address our current
over-reliance on non-renewable energy sources.  Mr. President, we hope that we
can find common ground to establish sound, sustainable, affordable energy policy
for Minnesota and for the country's future.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
