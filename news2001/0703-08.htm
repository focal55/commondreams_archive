- July 3 - Exactly 225 years after the United States was 
founded, 
many Americans are giving the country a failing grade when it comes to 
guarding the 
Constitutional rights the country was created to protect, according to a 
survey released for the Fourth of July holiday today.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most endangered right? The right to run for elected office, which only 
41% of 
Americans feel is open equally to rich and poor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also receiving a flunking grade is the right of equal access to the federal 
courts, which only 45% of Americans surveyed feel is open to rich and poor 
equally. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistics are part of the Second Annual Fourth of July Survey 
commissioned by New York public relations consultant Jeff Barge. The 
telephone survey of 1,000 households was conducted with the assistance of 
Opinion Research Corp. of Princeton, N.J. and has a margin of error of 3%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the second year in a row, Americans have given two of the nation's 
Constitutional rights a failing grade,&quot; said Mr. Barge. &quot;This should be a 
cause of some concern.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the news is not all gloomy. According to survey, the country has been 
more 
successful  in guaranteeing other Constitutional rights. Scoring highest is 
freedom of 
religion, which 91% feel is guaranteed equally to rich and poor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And despite the Florida voting fiasco last fall, 85% of Americans feel that 
the right to 
vote is equally available to rich and poor &#150; despite a controversial study by 
the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights saying that black voters in Florida were 10 times 
more  
likely to have their ballots rejected than white voters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, 69% of those surveyed feel that gun ownership is equally 
available to rich and poor; and 63% of Americans feel that the right to free 
speech is equally available to rich and poor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other surprising results of the Second Annual Fourth of July Survey:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--74% of Americans say that it is important for Congress to pass some form of 
campaign finance reform in order to protect democracy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--68% of Americans say that any kid in the country should be allowed to join 
the Boy 
Scouts, whether he is straight or gay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--39% of Americans believe George Bush would not now be president if minority 
votes in Florida had been accurately counted in last November's presidential 
election
-- with 70% of black Americans feeling that way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the survey, Americans' confidence in equal justice is the only 
right that has shown an increase in confidence in the past year, tacking on a 
17-point increase from  last year's dismal showing that only 28% of Americans 
felt rich and poor had equal access to justice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year's confidence level may have been dragged down by the spring release 
of &quot;And Justice for Some,&quot; funded by several of the nation's leading 
foundations. That study says black youths convicted of drug offenses are 48 
times more likely to be sentenced to juvenile prison than white youths. 
Overall, black youths with no record are six times as likely as whites to be 
imprisoned. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If President Bush wants to win the black vote in his re-election campaign, 
he might consider taking steps to stop discrimination against blacks in 
America's courts,&quot; says Mr Barge.  &quot;The Democrats have left themselves wide 
open on this issue.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although that study did not list the names of  the individual judges 
responsible for the wide disparity in sentencing, in this year's survey 72% 
of those polled say their names should be made public by the Justice Dept. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media reports that members of the Supreme Court discriminate against blacks 
and other minorities in making personal hiring decisions for judicial 
clerkships may also be contributing to a low score for the federal judicial 
system; 35% of those surveyed this year said that they were aware of media 
coverage of this Supreme Court discrimination.
 
A series of articles in USA Today and other newspapers have noted that only 
2% of Supreme Court clerks appointed by the present group of justices were 
black and only 1% Hispanic. Those articles singled out Chief Justice 
Rehnquist and Justices Souter, Scalia and Kennedy as four judges who have 
never hired a black clerk since being appointed to the Supreme Court. Chief 
Justice Rehnquist has been on the Supreme Court for 29 years, since being 
appointed by Nixon in 1972; Justice Scalia has been on the Court for 14 
years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the rise in overall confidence in equal justice, Americans were still 
skeptical 
about the fairness of the court system, with half of all Americans (50%) 
saying the courts are &quot;at least occasionally biased&quot; against the poor and 
minorities, and 37% saying they are &quot;often&quot; biased. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And overall, the nation was mixed as to whether Congress was doing a good job 
of protecting their Constitutional rights, with 78% saying Congress &quot;does a 
good job&quot; protecting freedom of religion; 71% saying it does a good job 
protecting voting rights; 62% saying it does a good job of protecting free 
speech; and 61% saying it does a good job of protecting access to guns. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But only 52% say Congress does a good job of protecting equal access of rich 
and poor to the courts; and just 41% say Congress does a good job of 
protecting equal access of rich and poor to elected office.
