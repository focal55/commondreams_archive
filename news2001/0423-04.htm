- April 23 - Congressman Bernard Sanders (I-VT) today released a letter signed by 15
Members of Congress calling on the House Leadership to immediately schedule
a vote to revoke Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China in response to
the Chinese government's detention of 24 American soldiers. The letter,
which is signed by Sanders and Democrats, joins calls from conservative
Republicans to repeal PNTR following the return of the American service men
and women from Hainan Island.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &quot;While it is imperative that we retain a friendly and positive
erelationship with China, it is clear that PNTR is not working from an
economic point of view, a political point of view, a human rights point of
view, or an environmental point of view. The idea that we would continue to
open up our markets to China and sustain an $84 billion annual trade deficit
at the same time they have held American servicemen and women prisoner and
continue to hold an American airplane is incomprehensible.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter details the declining environmental and human rights conditions
in China since PNTR was signed. In terms of the environment, China is the
home of five of the world's ten most polluted cities with 80 percent of
Chinese rivers having no fish because of pollution. On human rights, China
continues to hold 6 to 8 million political, religious, ethnic and labor
activists in forced labor camps - 300,000 of which have had no trial at all.
At the same time, PNTR has inflated the U.S. trade deficit with China to $84
billion a year, while the Chinese military grows in strength. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter is attached. It is signed by Rep. Sanders, Peter DeFazio, Marcy
Kaptur, Sherrod Brown, Ronnie Shows, Frank Pallone, Cynthia McKinney,
Jerrold Nadler, Peter Visclosky, Ted Strickland, William Pascrell, James
Traficant, Gene Taylor, Pete Stark, and Barbara Lee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-30-
Dear Mr. Speaker:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	We are writing to urge you to schedule a vote as soon as possible to
revoke Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.  While we believe
that the United States should have a positive and friendly relationship with
China, and we do not want to see another cold war, we believe that PNTR with
China is not accomplishing that important goal.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you know, in the debate on this issue last year many of us expressed
concern that granting PNTR to China would negatively impact the U.S. economy
and cost us hundreds of thousands of decent paying jobs.  We also felt that
such issues as human rights and environmental protection in China, as well
as U.S. national security issues, would be set back by granting PNTR and
doing away with the annual Congressional review of our trading status with
China. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One year after the PNTR vote, it appears that the concerns that many of us
had in opposing the agreement were justified:    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.	Our trade deficit with China is the largest in the world and has
increased from $57 billion in 1998 to $83.8 billion in 2000.  This huge
trade deficit with China is a major factor in our record breaking $449.5
billion trade deficit in goods.  According to some economists, every $1
billion in our U.S. trade deficit equals the loss of 14,000 jobs.  This
means that almost 60 percent of the 638,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs that we
have lost since June 1998 are the result of our growing trade deficit with
China.  In other words, PNTR for China has been a disaster for American
workers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.	Religious groups from throughout the world, including the Catholic
Church,  continue to decry China's human rights record.  Since passage of
PNTR, China's human rights abuses have grown even worse.  Presently there
are 6 million to 8 million political, religious, ethnic and labor activists
in Chinese forced labor camps.  About 300,000 of them are held without
trial, as was a 5-year-old American child in February of 2001.  His mother,
a U.S. resident, is still being held in captivity in China today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.	China's horrendous environmental record continues to threaten the
well-being of the entire planet.  Today, five of the world's ten most
polluted cities are in China and an estimated two million people die each
year there from air and water pollution.  Water pollution is so severe that
80 percent of China's rivers have no fish remaining in them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.	PNTR with China has also not benefited U.S. national security
interests.  As China's economy has expanded through increased trade with the
U.S., so has its military.  China continues its belligerent stance towards
Taiwan and is steadily expanding its arsenal of missiles, aircraft,
submarines and destroyers.  For example, in recent years China has deployed
more than 300 short-range ballistic missiles with the capability of
blanketing the island of Taiwan.  China has also bought over 4,000
warplanes, four Russian Kilo-class submarines, and two Russian-made
Sovremenny-class destroyers that are a major worry for both Taiwan and the
United States.  Chinese workers have also been detected building a
fiber-optic communications system linking Iraq's air defenses. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite differing views in Congress on PNTR, clearly a major event has
recently occurred that is of enormous concern to all of us: the illegal
detention of 24 American servicemen and women who were forced to make an
emergency landing after a Chinese fighter pilot rammed their plane over
international waters.  Through the courage and skill of the American crew,
they survived that event only to be held hostage for 11 days by our
so-called &quot;friendly&quot; trading partner in gross violation of international
law.  China, a country that has been granted free access to our markets,
still illegally holds the plane it damaged and is rifling through it to
steal our technology.  On top of all that, China demands an apology for a
crisis that it precipitated. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, while we want the United States to have a friendly and
constructive relationship with China, PNTR is obviously not accomplishing
that end.  We need to develop a relationship with China that truly advances
the goals of U.S. economic and national security, as well as promoting
democracy, freedom and environmental sanity in China.  Recent events show
that giving China a blank check for trade has not worked.  Therefore, we ask
that you schedule a vote to revoke PNTR with China as soon as possible.</font></p>
