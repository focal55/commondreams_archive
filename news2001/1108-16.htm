<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - November 8 - Today, The Interfaith 
Alliance (TIA), the nation's leading interfaith advocacy 
organization, and 27 religious organizations, including Jewish, 
Christian, Muslim, Sikh and Jain groups, urged President Bush to 
hold off on pushing the U.S. Senate into taking action on the 
deeply divisive issue of the faith-based initiative this year. (See 
letter attached). </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Furthermore, The Interfaith Alliance is concerned that with 
national attention being placed on a lack of donations to charities 
not connected with September 11 relief efforts, we will see the 
president put pressure on the Senate to pass his faith-based 
initiative, otherwise known as the 'Armies of Compassion' Bill,&quot; 
said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of TIA. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, The Washington Post cited the president as saying, &quot;It is 
now time for America to stand by her charities as they suffer from 
the economic consequences of September 11.&quot; The Rev. Gaddy believes 
that this statement points to the Administration's strategy to put 
direct pressure on Congress to pass faith-based legislation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The faith-based initiative puts our civil and religious 
liberties at risk,&quot; said the Rev. Gaddy. &quot;For the last few months, 
we have heard calls from members of Congress and the White House to 
not use the terrorist attacks to promote special interest projects. 
It seems to me that is precisely what the president is doing.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important to note that the $1 billion dollars raised on 
behalf of September 11 relief efforts, equals only one-half of one 
percent of the $203.45 billion in philanthropic giving that took 
place in this country last year. (Miller and Rollins Fund Raising) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Letter to president is attached (letter was delivered to the 
White House late Thursday afternoon, November 8, 2001) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November 8, 2001 <br>
President George W. Bush <br>
The White House <br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW <br>
Washington, D.C. 20500 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear President Bush, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we reflect on how the lamentable and egregious assault on our 
nation has impacted the religious landscape in America, we, the 
undersigned religious organizations, write to you on behalf of 
hundreds of thousands of people of diverse faiths to urge you to 
reconsider any legislative action on the charitable choice 
provisions in your Faith-Based Initiative at this time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, many of us support the major tax incentives you 
have proposed as part of your Faith-Based Initiative. We believe 
that such tax incentives would continue - and even further - the 
recent outpouring of contributions and individual giving with which 
the American people have blessed and empowered charities and 
religious organizations since our national tragedy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the organizations listed below can agree to disagree about 
whether your expanded charitable choice proposal is a step forward 
or a step backwards for religious liberty, as people who affirm the 
critical role of faith as a healing source in our society, we all 
agree that now is not the time to advance such a religiously 
divisive and controversial legislative provision. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, any effort by the White House to advance 
charitable choice in the foreseeable future has the potential to 
turn the national sentiment away from feelings of unity and 
patriotism and back to the contentiousness and partisanship that 
were so evident before September 11. As people of faith, we are 
particularly concerned about the following unintended consequences 
of having a debate on charitable choice at this time: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, since you announced this initiative during the opening 
days of your administration, organizations and faith groups from 
across the ideological and theological spectrum have expressed 
numerous objections to charitable choice, including the selection 
process, during which political appointees and bureaucrats would 
decide which faith-based organizations would receive funding and 
which ones would not. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This debate subsequently sparked a spirited national dialogue 
about criteria that would be used in the government's decisions 
about which religions would receive federal funds. During this 
dialogue, it became increasingly clear that many political 
appointees and elected officials do not have an adequate 
understanding - or appreciation - of minority religions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A reopened debate at this time about what qualifies as an 
acceptable religion will become all the more contentious in the 
wake of recent events as numerous hate crimes have been directed at 
our nation's Muslim, Hindu, Jain and Sikh citizens out of 
misunderstanding and unfortunate ignorance. As people of faith, we 
fear that these communities would only be further ostracized in the 
funding and selection process due to misinformation, false 
stereotyping and retaliation. While we wish this not to be the 
case, recently reported inflammatory remarks by a Member of 
Congress toward Arab-Americans make our fear well founded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, in the aftermath of September 11, we have joined you in 
calling for an increase in civic duty through volunteerism and 
personal giving. The result of this has been an outpouring of 
compassion matched with generous giving by the American people. 
Were we to have a debate about charitable choice at this time, we 
fear that the public's assumption that it is the role of government 
- not the people - to fund the good works of houses of worship 
would blunt the sense of personal responsibility that has been so 
apparent and lower the sacrificial level of giving that has been so 
helpful. Mr. President, we do not need any action that lessens a 
sense of personal responsibility and reduces levels of generosity 
toward those in need. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, as organizations representing the breadth of religious 
life in this nation, we believe that any action on this issue 
during this time of increased sensitivities toward the minority 
faith community will sadly divert the country's attention away from 
the positive effects of interfaith cooperation and leadership that 
have been so apparent and focus on the differences that divide 
America's rich religious landscape. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, as a person of deep faith yourself, we hope you 
will listen to our counsel and consider our point of view as we all 
work with you to try to heal a nation that is torn by grief, sorrow 
and hurt, but united by a deep sense of patriotism, personal faith 
and conviction. </font></p>
