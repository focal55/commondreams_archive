- January 17 - At his confirmation hearing today before the Senate Judiciary
        Committee, former Senator John Ashcroft responded to questions about his environmental
        record by stating, &quot;I happen to be a private environmentalist.&quot;
        Environmentalists concerned with his appointment to the position of Attorney General found
        the statement surprising.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a U.S. Senator, John Ashcroft&#146;s environmentalism has been very private
        indeed &#150; so private that it is impossible to find evidence of it in his voting
        record,&quot; said Joan Mulhern, Legislative Counsel for the Earthjustice Legal Defense
        Fund. &quot;In fact, he has kept his concern for the environment an absolute secret. In
        the last four years, Senator Ashcroft voted against every major environmental bill or
        amendment considered by the U.S. Senate. His lifetime environmental voting record, as
        scored by the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters, shows that he voted for the
        environment less that 4 percent of the time during his entire Senate tenure.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If he is a private environmentalist, he certainly had us fooled,&quot; added
        Mulhern. &quot;He even cosponsored bills in the last Congress to weaken key provisions of
        the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, two of the nation&#146;s most fundamental and
        important environmental protection and public health laws.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Attorney General is one the most important environmental appointments made by
        any President. As the nation&#146;s chief law enforcement official, the Attorney General
        is charged with the responsibility of enforcing all federal laws, including the laws
        designed to protect the nation&#146;s precious natural resources and the public&#146;s
        health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whatever his &quot;private&quot; feelings, as public servant in the United States
        Senate, Mr. Ashcroft consistently demonstrated hostility towards the nation&#146;s
        environmental and public health protection laws &#150; laws that the Attorney General is
        obliged to enforce,&quot; Mulhern said. &quot;Because his record is extremely
        anti-environmental, and the position of Attorney General is so central to whether the laws
        will be enforced, the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund opposes John Ashcroft&#146;s his
        confirmation as Attorney General.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">______________________________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>EARTHJUSTICE LETTER ON ASHCROFT NOMINATION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>January 15, 2001</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch:</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>I am writing to convey Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund&#146;s opposition to
        former Senator John Ashcroft&#146;s confirmation as the next Attorney General of the
        United States. As the country&#146;s leading nonprofit environmental law firm, we believe
        it is necessary to speak out against the appointment of an Attorney General who has
        consistently demonstrated hostility towards the nation&#146;s environmental and public
        health protection laws &#150; laws that the Attorney General is obliged to enforce. It
        would be contrary to the interests of the nation for the U.S. Senate to approve John
        Ashcroft as Attorney General. We therefore urge you to vote against his confirmation.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>The U.S. Attorney General is one the most important environmental
        appointments made by any President. As the nation&#146;s chief law enforcement
        official, the Attorney General is charged with the responsibility of enforcing all federal
        laws, including the laws designed to protect the nation&#146;s precious natural resources
        and the public&#146;s health. The Attorney General&#146;s wide-ranging responsibilities as
        head of the Department of Justice (DOJ) makes the AG a central policymaker in all legal
        matters involving federal clean water, clean air, public lands, endangered species, and
        overall environmental health laws, as well as related civil rights laws that ensure that
        all Americans receive equal justice under the law. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>As you know, the AG directs the DOJ&#146;s Environment and Natural Resources
        Division, which is responsible for enforcing the nation's environmental laws and defending
        legal challenges to the government&#146;s environmental programs and activities. The
        Criminal Division develops and enforces the criminal provisions of more than 900 statutes,
        including the criminal provisions of federal environmental laws, and formulates and
        implements overall criminal enforcement policy. The Solicitor General's Office supervises
        and conducts the federal government&#146;s litigation in the United States Supreme Court
        -- a critical role, as the United States is involved in about two-thirds of all the cases
        the U.S. Supreme Court decides on the merits each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney General
        also oversees the U.S. Attorneys, who are the government&#146;s front-line litigators
        under federal environmental statutes. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>The Attorney General&#146;s direction and oversight of all of these offices
        deeply influences national environmental policy. Whatever the statutes, if they are not
        vigorously and fairly enforced, the people and resources the laws are meant to protect are
        not served.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Senator Ashcroft&#146;s positions on environmental protection matters place him
        well outside the mainstream of American political values and raise troubling questions as
        to his ability and willingness to enforce laws that he has long opposed. As a U.S.
        Senator, John Ashcroft&#146;s anti-environmental record is clear: he has not only voted
        repeatedly against efforts to strengthen natural resources and public heath protections,
        he has consistently supported efforts to weaken environmental laws that are currently on
        the books &#150; laws that he would be charged to enforce and defend as Attorney General. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>For example, in the 106<sup>th</sup> Congress, Senator Ashcroft was one of only
        six Senators to cosponsor a bill, S. 495, that would have drastically weakened the Clean
        Air Act by taking away one of the most critical enforcement tools against states that fail
        to meet clean air requirements: sanctions restricting federal highway aid. Senator
        Ashcroft voted on October 12, 2000, against stripping a rider from a spending bill that
        prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from officially listing localities in
        violation of new soot and smog air standards until June 2001, or until the Supreme Court
        decides a case concerning these new standards, even though the lower courts had confirmed
        the agency&#146;s authority to make the designations. Senator Ashcroft had previously
        attacked these new clean air regulations, cosponsoring a bill in the 105<sup>th</sup>
        Congress, S. 1084, that would have blocked these strong standards designed to protect
        children, seniors, and others from smog and soot.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Also in the last Congress, Senator Ashcroft cosponsored S. 2417, an attack on a
        key enforcement component of the 1972 Clean Water Act, the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)
        program, designed to clean up waters too polluted for swimming, fishing, and other uses.
        For many years, states and EPA largely ignored this critical program until lawsuits
        brought by environmental groups, including Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, compelled EPA
        and the states to start meeting their responsibilities under the Act to identify and
        restore impaired waters. Now that the law is being implemented, it has come under fierce
        attack from industry groups, and S. 2417 was part of the effort to undermine this part of
        the original Clean Water Act. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Senator Ashcroft has voted on several occasions, most recently April 6, 2000, to
        open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Senator Ashcroft voted
        against a bipartisan attempt to remove a provision in the Senate FY 2001 budget resolution
        that assumed $1.2 billion in anticipated revenue from oil drilling in the Arctic National
        Wildlife Refuge.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>On July 18, 2000, Senator Ashcroft supported an unsuccessful attack on national
        monuments, voting for an amendment that would have undermined the President's authority to
        protect spectacular natural areas by prohibiting the designation of any new national
        monuments unless authorized by Congress.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Senator Ashcroft has been a cosponsor of measures that are contrary to the
        Constitutional rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court that would let land speculators and
        developers go directly to federal courts to press their &quot;takings&quot; claims in the
        event that a local planning or zoning ordinance restricted any use of private property.
        This legislation would federalize local environmental protection and land use issues to
        give well-funded developers the upper hand in dealing with local officials exercising
        their duties to protect their communities. The legislation he favors flies in the face of
        his professed support for local control and a limited federal government role.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In 1995, Senator Ashcroft defended a sweeping bill, the Comprehensive Regulatory
        Reform Act of 1995, that would have undercut legal safeguards for environmental, human
        health, consumer and labor protection. During debate on that measure, Senator Ashcroft
        also voted for a proposal that would allow polluting industries to avoid reporting most of
        their toxic chemical releases as required by the 1986 Community Right to Know Act, a
        critical tool for communities working to reduce exposure to harmful pollution. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress, Senator Ashcroft twice voted in support of the
        now infamous &quot;salvage logging rider&quot; that waived all federal environmental law
        for so-called salvage logging in all national forests and old growth logging in certain
        forests of the Pacific Northwest. The abuses made possible by this provision became so
        rampant that the Secretary of Agriculture was forced to subsequently issue a directive to
        the Forest Service telling the agency to end the practice of reissuing previously planned
        green tree sales as salvage sales in order to avoid compliance with our environmental
        laws.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>These are just a few of many examples of Senator Ashcroft&#146;s extreme
        anti-environmental record. According to the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters,
        Senator Ashcroft voted against the environment on every floor vote the organization
        tallied in the last two Congresses. He has a lifetime average of voting for the
        environment just 3.7 percent of the time during his career in the U.S. Senate. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Based on this record, Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund does not believe that, as
        Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft will defend the nation&#146;s environmental protection
        laws with the vigor and commitment that the office requires and the public deserves. We
        believe the nation&#146;s interests would be better served by the appointment and
        confirmation of an Attorney General with more balanced, moderate positions on the
        environment, an issue of great importance to the American people and the future of this
        nation. </small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund respectfully requests that you vote against
        Senator Ashcroft&#146;s confirmation. Thank you for your consideration of our views.</small></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Sincerely, </small><br>
