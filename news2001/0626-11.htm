- June 26 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), a staunch advocate for
labor protections, today introduced groundbreaking legislation to strengthen the
basic rights of workers to organize and to join a union.  The Right-to-Organize
Act of 2001 addresses the serious shortcomings of the National Labor Relations
Act (NLRA) that, over the years, have eroded the framework of worker empowerment
which the NLRA was designed to ensure.  Wellstone, now Chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on  Employment, Safety, and Training with jurisdiction over the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), said the bill will shore up the crumbling
foundation of democracy in the workplace that the NLRA was intended to promote,
and targets the worst abuses of labor law that have become all too common in
recent years.     </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The need for labor law reform is urgent &#150; not only for workers who seek to join
together and bargain collectively, but for all Americans.  One of the most
important things we can do to raise the standard of living and quality of life
for working Americans, raise wages and benefits, improve health and safety in
the workplace, and give average Americans more control over their lives is to
enforce their right to organize, join, and belong to a union.  The right to
organize will be one of the most important civil rights and human rights causes
of the 21st century.  Congress must restore that right to its proper place,&#148;
said Wellstone.   </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All to often across America, workers who choose to organize, participate, or
voice their concerns about the terms and conditions of their workplace live in
fear - fear of being harassed, of losing wages and benefits, of being put on
leave without pay  &#150; and ultimately fear of losing their jobs because they
choose to exercise their legal rights to associate for the purposes of
bargaining collectively and participating in decision-making about their own
workplaces. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated that 10,000 Americans lose their jobs illegally every year just
for supporting union organizing campaigns.  The 1994 Dunlop Commission found
that one in four employers illegally fired union activists during organizing
campaigns.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employers regularly fire workers and engage in other unfair labor practices to
discourage union organizing and union representation.  They do it with virtual
impunity because today&#146;s labor laws simply are too weak to discourage management
from doing so.   Employers routinely monopolize
the debates leading up to union certification elections, and drag out election
campaigns to give themselves more time to harass workers and create a climate of
fear and intimidation.  There also is the growing problem of employers refusing
to bargain with their employees even after a union has been duly certified. 
Achieving so-called &#147;first contracts&#148; can often be as,  or more,  harrowing than
the organizing effort itself.
Wellstone&#146;s Right-to-Organize Act of 2001 is a first step in tackling the more
serious obstacles to labor organizing.  The Act would do the following:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amend the National Labor Relations Act to provide equal time to labor
organizations to provide information about union representation. Under this
proposal the employer would trigger the equal time provision by expressing
opinions on union representation during work hours or at the work site.  Once
the triggering actions occur, then the union would be entitled to equal time to
use the same media used by the employer to distribute information and be allowed
access to the work site to communicate with employees.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Toughen penalties for wrongful discharge violations.   In particular, the bill
would require the National Labor Relations Board to award back pay equal to 3
times the employee&#146;s wages when the Board finds that an employee is discharged
as a result of an unfair labor practice.  It also would allow employees to file
civil actions to recover punitive damages when they have been discharged as a
result of an unfair labor practice.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Require expedited elections in cases where a supermajority of workers have
signed union recognition cards designating a union as the employee&#146;s labor
organization.   In particular, it would require elections within 14 days after
receipt of signed union recognition cards from 60 percent of the employees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Erect mediation and arbitration procedures to help employers and employees reach
mutually agreeable first-contract collective bargaining agreements.   The bill
would require mediation if the parties cannot reach agreement on their own after
60 days.  Should the parties not reach agreement 30 days after a mediator is
selected, then either party could call in the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service for binding arbitration. In this way both parties would have incentives
to reach genuine agreement without allowing either side to hold the other
hostage indefinitely to unrealistic proposals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;When workers join together to fight for job security, for dignity, for economic
justice and for a fair share of America's prosperity, it is not a struggle
merely for their own benefit.  The gains of unionized workers on
bread-and-butter issues are key to the economic security of all working
families.   Upholding the right to organize is a way to advance important social
objectives -- higher wages, better benefits, more pension coverage, more worker
training, more health insurance coverage, and safer work places -- for all
Americans without creating any government programs to get us there,&#148; Wellstone
said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone also joined Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today as an original co-sponsor
of The Workplace Fairness Act.  That bill amends the NLRA and the Railway Labor
Act to prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacement workers during a
strike, or giving employment preference to cross-over employees.   It also makes
it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to allow a striking worker
to return to work if that worker has unconditionally offered to return to work.
Together with The Right-to-Organize Act of 2001, these measures produce the
basic platform for healthy economies, healthy communities, and healthy families.
