- October 9 - The Green Party of the United
States has issued an official statement on the
September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon, and U.S. airlines.  The statement is printed
below.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The statement represents a broad consensus of the 33
states in the party's Coordinating Committee,&quot; said
Ben Manski, a Wisconsin Green and a member of the
national Steering Committee of the Green Party.  &quot;It
addresses the atrocities committed on September 11,
the surrounding issues, and what Greens believe is an
appropriate response that emphasizes justice instead
of vengeance, the safety of our people, the rule of
law, and a systematic approach to deterring terrorism.
 It urges President Bush and his Cabinet to respond to
the attacks as crimes against humanity punishable
under international law, rather than a motivation for
war -- which would result in many more civilian
deaths.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
GREEN PARTY STATEMENT On The September 11th Events</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States is shocked by the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. We extend our
deepest sympathy to those most personally affected by
these horrific events. We remember especially the
injured, the loved ones of those who have died, the
innocents who lost their lives in the midst of an
ordinary day's work, and those heroic firefighters,
police officers and other relief workers who gave
their lives unquestioningly. These were our neighbors,
co-workers, friends and family members. As Americans
and as members of the human family, we are all
irrevocably affected by this terror.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREEN PARTY URGES ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens fully support the right and obligation of the
U.S. to seek justice. The complete disregard for the
sanctity of human life displayed by the perpetrators
of these atrocities must be countered by a just and
lawful response. Justice is the goal and mark of a
civilized society. Thus, we call on the United States
Government to exercise caution and restraint as we
form a response to these attacks. Indiscriminate
military actions and acts of vengeance would only
escalate violence and generate additional hatred.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, a unilateral and indiscriminate military
response, especially on the Afghan or Arab peoples,
can easily be misperceived as an attack on Islam. 
This would undermine international support for the US,
further fanaticism and terrorism and ultimately
imperil the possibility of peace in the future. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, we believe that the September 11, 2001
attacks on innocent civilians should, in accordance
with domestic and international law, be characterized
as an international crime against humanity, not a war.
A full investigation, undertaken with international
cooperation, must take place before the President and
Congress attempt to bring those responsible to
justice. Accordingly, the identification of any
perpetrator of these offenses and their supporters
must be based on solid and credible evidence not by
innuendo or conviction in the media. A sound legal
case must be made and brought to federal and
international courts for arrest and  extradition as
necessary. American declarations of war inhibit rather
than promote this international cooperation. Attempts
to unilaterally seek redress through bombs and
missiles, rather than a court of law, will undermine
international law, and set back recent international
successes in bringing those who have committed crimes
against humanity to justice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accordingly, the Green Party specifically opposes any
attempt by President Bush to wage war outside the
scrutiny of Congress and the American public for whom
they speak. The U.S. Constitution addresses war powers
explicitly and does not, under any interpretation,
allow a president a &quot;blank check&quot; power to wage war. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREENS FEAR EROSION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AT HOME</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No matter who the perpetrators of the September
attacks prove to be, unjust attacks in the U.S. or
abroad against Arab-Americans, Arabs, Muslims or
anyone else of Middle Eastern ancestry are
unacceptable and un-American.  Therefore, we encourage
President Bush and other public officials to continue
to denounce sentiments and behavior that target ethnic
or religious groups in revenge for the September 11th
attacks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The September 11th attacks struck out at American
democracy as well as the World Trade Center and
Pentagon. By definition, terrorism opposes
representative government, undermines civil liberties,
and represses religious freedom and ethnic diversity.
Therefore, our response to terrorism must not erode
these very same civil liberties and constitutional
rights. While we understand the immediate need for
measures like increased airport security, we oppose
any restriction on civil political dissent, which
would, in effect, make democratic accountability a
casualty of the September 11th attacks. Critical, open
and honest civic debate about our past and future
policy is essential to a solid and lasting democracy.
We urge our fellow citizens to  be vigilant in
supporting our civil liberties, which are always
vulnerable during times of conflict.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS TO TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE AGAINST
CIVILIANS</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While there is never any justification for acts of
terror against innocent civilians -- indeed it is the
quintessential act of dehumanization -- the events of
September 11th bring Americans the unique occasion to
reconsider our government's role on the world stage. 
The Green Party calls attention to the fact that, even
in the midst of our national anger, grief, and fear,
the US remains the most militarily powerful and
influential country in the world at present. In accord
with this and our identity as a leading defender of
democracy, we have the obligation to act
democratically and model moral and just standards for
others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, in seeking to prevent further terrorist attacks
in the US and elsewhere, the Green Party urges our
nation to reassess our government's policies and
actions, which at worst, may have served to justify
terrorism in the minds of our attackers and their
sympathizers, and at least, may continue to be sources
of frustration and anger for many freedom-seeking
peoples around the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party asserts that a significant aspect of
preventing future terrorist attacks on the United
States is to insure that our foreign policy is firmly
based on economic and social justice. Specifically, we
call on the U.S. to end the economic sanctions against
Iraq which have resulted in the death of over a half
million innocent Iraqi children and civilians. We also
call on the U.S. to insist that international law be
strictly observed with regard to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, the Green Party of the United States
urges our fellow citizens and people everywhere to
view September 11th as an opportunity to call for an
end to all violence towards civilians. As our platform
states, the Green Party seeks strength through peace
and asserts that security and liberty prosper
together. While we recognize the need for self-defense
and the defense of others who are in helpless
situations, we trust that non-violence provides the
surest road to peace. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, at this turning point in world affairs, we
strongly urge President Bush to lead the world
forward, toward a realignment of peoples and nations,
not backward into an era of military and economic
conquest characterized by endless violence. We can
signal this new era with a declaration strictly
banning the targeting of civilians and non-combatants
and the use of weapons of mass destruction.  This new
era can be  sustained by a rededication of our vast
resources away from producing more weapons and towards
eradicating the poverty, disease and ignorance that
foster despair and insecurity for most of the world's
people. Finally, we urge people and governments around
the world to join us in the most pressing challenge of
this new millennium: to create a culture of peace. It
is in meeting these demands of peace, that we will
know what peace truly is. The deaths of over 6000
innocents demand it.</font></p>
