- January 2 - The nomination of former Senator Spencer Abraham and former Colorado
  Attorney General Gale Norton to head the departments of Energy and Interior,
  respectively, is a giant step backwards for environmental protection, the
  League of Conservation Voters (LCV) concluded today.  Bush announced Abraham’s nomination today
  and Norton’s last Friday.
<p>&quot;We are stunned by
  President-elect Bush’s appointment of Abraham, a member of LCV’s 2000 Dirty
  Dozen list, and our number one target for defeat last year,&quot; said LCV
  President Deb Callahan.  &quot;He even
  co-sponsored a bill to abolish the very department he’s been nominated to
  lead.  In Norton, Bush has nominated
  someone whose environmental ethic is a throwback to the James Watt era -- one
  of the darkest periods of natural resource exploitation.  These appointments don’t reflect the
  reality that conservatism and conservation shouldn’t be treated as
  conflicting values.&quot;</p>
	 <p>Abraham, who served as a U.S. Senator from Michigan
  from 1995 to 2000, compiled an abysmal lifetime LCV environmental voting
  score of five percent -- the worst in Michigan and the worst in the Great
  Lakes region.  In the last Congress,
  Abraham earned a failing score of zero percent.  LCV named Abraham to its 2000 Dirty Dozen list of
  anti-environment congressional candidates and spent $700,000 in a successful
  effort to inform voters of his anti-environment record and ensure his
  defeat.  In 1999, Abraham was one of
  four senators to sponsor a bill to abolish the Energy Department.  Also that year, he voted against stronger
  fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks and to cut funding for
  renewable energy programs.  Abraham also supported numerous legislative
  riders to eliminate the EPA’s role in protecting wetlands and to prohibit the
  EPA from regulating arsenic in drinking water.  In 1998, he supported a rider to the Fiscal Year 2000 Interior
  Appropriations bill that would have legalized unlimited mine waste dumping on
  public lands.  In 2000,
  Abraham’s re-election campaign accepted more campaign contributions from
  polluting industries and interests than any other congressional candidate --
  over $700,000.</p>
	 <p>Norton is a protégé of James Watt, President
  Reagan's controversial Interior secretary from 1981 to 1983.  She worked for Watt while he was president
  of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative organization that
  strongly supports &quot;takings&quot; legislation and logging and mining on the
  nation’s public lands.  She also
  served in the Reagan administration, first in the Agriculture Department and
  then in the Interior Department where she helped advocate for the Reagan
  administration’s position on oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
  Refuge.  As Colorado Attorney General,
  Norton was instrumental in creating the state’s &quot;self audit&quot; program, which
  gives businesses immunity from litigation and fines if they voluntarily
  report and correct violations of environmental laws.  She is also a former co-chair of the Coalition
  of Republican Environmental Advocates (CREA), an industry-funded front
  group whose members include such anti-environment foes as Representative
  Chenoweth-Hage and House Resources Committee Chairman Don Young. </p>
	 
<p>&quot;Abraham and
  Norton’s nominations are terrible news for the majority of Americans who rank
  protecting the nation’s air, water and national resources among their top
  priorities,&quot; said LCV President Deb Callahan. &quot;While Bush’s appointment of
  Christie Todd Whitman to head the </p>
<p>Environmental
  Protection Agency appeared to be a step in the right direction, his choices
  of Abraham and Norton are signs of environmental regress, not progress.&quot;</p>
<p>To date, Bush has
  nominated Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta to be secretary of
  Transportation.  Mineta, a Democratic
  member of the House from 1975 to 1995, earned a lifetime environmental
  average of 75 percent. In addition, John Ashcroft has been nominated to serve
  as attorney general.  Ashcroft, a
  former U.S. Senator from Missouri, earned a lifetime LCV environmental rating
  of five percent for his votes on key environmental legislation from 1995 to
  2000.  He repeatedly voted against
  funding for clean air and water and against increased funding for the cleanup
  of toxic waste sites.  Bush
  has also named Ann Veneman as his choice for agriculture secretary and Donald
  Evans, Bush campaign chairman and the chairman of an oil company, as commerce
  secretary.  Both Evans and Veneman will
  have significant jurisdiction over key environmental policies pertaining to
  such hot-button environmental issues as genetically modified food, trade and
  environment, and marine and coastal protections.</p>
<p><i>The
  League of Conservation Voters is the political voice for the national
  environmental community. LCV has published a Scorecard for each Congress since 1970.  The votes tabulated in the Scorecards are based on the
  consensus recommendation of experts from 25 nonpartisan environmental,
  conservation and sportsmen’s groups. 
  The Scorecard assigns a
  percentage score to every representative and senator. A 100 percent score
  indicates the strongest environmental commitment, while a zero percent shows
  a consistent voting pattern against conservation and public health
  protections. LCV is working full-time to monitor administration appointments
  and actions that affect the environment.&nbsp; Information on LCV’s efforts
  pertaining to the administration will be made available to reporters and over
  the Internet at <a href="http://www.lcv.org">www.lcv.org</a>.&nbsp;
