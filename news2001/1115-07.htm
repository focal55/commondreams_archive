<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 15 - A coalition of leading
women's health care advocates called today for the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) to revise their Ethical and
Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (Directives)
and end their ban on voluntary female sterilization at Catholic and
Catholic-affiliated hospitals. The coalition's call was contained
in a letter to Bishop Wilton Gregory, who was just elected
president of the USCCB at its fall 2001 meeting, which closes today
in Washington, DC. Fifteen organizations, including women's health,
rights, and research groups, cited a review of 150 hospital mergers
in the past decade that has identified at least 40 non-Catholic
hospitals that had merged with Catholic hospitals and now face
having to comply with the Directives and stop providing female
sterilization to thousands of women, many of them poor.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition offered to work with the USCCB to design a
solution to preserve voluntary sterilization in all mergers between
Catholic and non-Catholic hospitals. They appealed to the bishops'
to adhere to their position on providing equitable health care for
all, particularly low-income people who cannot afford health
insurance.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Surely a pastoral exception can be made to allow non-Catholic
hospitals in partnership with Catholic hospitals to provide a
health care service that is so needed and vital, especially for
low-income women. Such a exception would also allow the millions
of Catholic and non-Catholic women who choose sterilization each
year to exercise their freedom of conscience at the hospital of
their choice, in their community."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to pressure from the Vatican, the bishops had voted
to revise the Directives in June 2001, putting sterilization on par
with abortion and euthanasia as an "intrinsically immoral" service
and banning the procedure at all Catholic and Catholic-affiliated
hospitals. Non-Catholic hospitals across the country are now
struggling to find ways to avoid complying with the Directives and
to continue to provide tubal ligation, a service that is one of the
most affordable and safest methods of contraception.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---
The full text of the letter follows:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November 15, 2001
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bishop Wilton Gregory
<br>
President
<br>
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops
<br>
3211 4th Street, N.E.
<br>
Washington, DC 20017-1194
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Bishop Gregory:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As organizations dedicated to the health and well-being of
women, we respectfully ask the United States Conference of Catholic
Bishops to reconsider its June 2001 decision to revise the Ethical
and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services
("Directives") as they relate to the provision of sterilization for
women. The revised Directives strictly limit the ability of
non-Catholic hospitals that have merged with Catholic hospitals to
provide voluntary female sterilization. As a result, thousands of
women, most of them poor, will be deprived of an essential health
service option.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A review by Catholics for a Free Choice of the approximately 150
hospital mergers in the past decade has identified 40 such
situations in which sterilization services were preserved but are
now jeopardized by the revised Directives. We can also confirm
that several of these hospitals, like Sierra Nevada Memorial
Hospital in Grass Valley, CA, are the only hospitals providing
sterilization services for women in the area.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preserving the option of voluntary female sterilization in such
hospital mergers would be consistent with the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops' persistent calls for equitable
health care for all, particularly low-income people who cannot
afford health insurance. It would also be consistent with the
wishes of the communities that insisted as a condition for
approving the merger of a non-Catholic hospital with a Catholic
hospital that voluntary sterilization continue to be offered. The
citizens of these communities recognized that female
sterilization-one of the most affordable and safest methods of
contraception- is a service that women cannot do without.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, female sterilization
is the most commonly used form of contraception in the United
States. For couples who have completed their families, for women
who cannot use other forms of contraception for health reasons, and
for women whose lives or health would be endangered by another
pregnancy and require certainty about their method of
contraception, sterilization is an important option.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surely a pastoral exception can be made to allow non-Catholic
hospitals in partnership with Catholic hospitals to provide a
health care service that is so needed and vital, especially for
low-income women. Such an exception would also allow the millions
of Catholic and non-Catholic women who choose sterilization each
year to exercise their freedom of conscience at the hospital of
their choice, in their community. At the same time, we remain
concerned about arrangements that restrict access to women's health
service.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would be happy to work with the United States Conference of
Catholic Bishops to design a solution that would preserve voluntary
sterilization services in all mergers between Catholic and
non-Catholic hospitals nationwide.
