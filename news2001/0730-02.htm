- July 30 - WASHINGTON, D.C. &#150; Responding to scrutiny from public
interest organizations and a lawyer who has represented nuclear workers, the Department of
Energy (DOE) last week revoked its contract with Science Applications International
Corporation (SAIC) to evaluate plans to release and recycle radioactive metals from DOE
facilities.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a meeting with DOE officials last Monday, Public
Citizen and other citizen organizations raised questions about the process that led DOE to
hire SAIC to perform a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for the proposed
recycling. The DOE canceled the contract on Wednesday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DOE's choice of SAIC earlier this year followed the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) termination of another SAIC contract &#150; also
related to radioactive waste recycling &#150; upon the discovery that the company had a
conflict of interest within its regulatory agency contracts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conflict stems from SAIC&#146;s role as a
&quot;regulatory compliance&quot; partner with British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL), which
in 1997 was awarded a quarter-billion dollar DOE contract to recycle radioactive nickel at
the DOE&#146;s Oak Ridge, Tenn., facility. The NRC subsequently awarded SAIC a separate
contract to provide independent expertise as part of its effort to establish standards for
the recycling. SAIC prepared the NRC's NUREG 1640, the official NRC report that
&quot;documents the technical basis for the [NRC] to use in developing regulatory
standards for clearing equipment and materials with residual radioactivity from nuclear
facilities.&quot; In effect, while profiting from the BNFL project to recycle radioactive
materials from DOE facilities, SAIC was hired by the NRC to write the standards that would
regulate recycling at commercial nuclear power facilities. In early 2000, following
citizen complaints that SAIC had a conflict of interest, the NRC terminated this SAIC
contract. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizen groups raised the same conflict-of-interest
objections about the subsequent DOE contract with SAIC to perform the environmental
assessment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In September 2000, the DOE's Inspector General reported
that the BNFL activities had actually increased risk to the public, stating that
&quot;BNFL did not perform accurate surveys of contaminated metals before the contractor
released the metals for recycling on the open market. &#133; As a result, there was
increased risk to the public that contaminated metals were released from the site.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In last Monday's meeting with DOE representatives, the
concerned groups demanded to see various documents regarding the SAIC contract award,
including the contract itself and all conflict-of-interest disclosure materials that SAIC
should have provided to the DOE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While this contract withdrawal is a small step in
the right direction, the DOE still needs to do much more to guarantee that its radioactive
waste and materials won't end up in commerce or the general environment,&quot; said
Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program.
&quot;The DOE's contract with SAIC was either a horrible lapse in judgment or a slap in
the face to Americans who do not want to be exposed to additional radiation. In any case,
it's ridiculous that this PEIS is even being performed. The current suspension on
recycling metals should be made permanent and should be expanded to all other radioactive
materials.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dan Guttman, a Washington, D.C. attorney who has
represented nuclear workers, said: &quot;It is critical for the public to understand that
responsible DOE officials evidently did not red-flag the conflict-of-interest and
responsible contractor issues raised by the award. The good news is that they were
responsive to citizens who pointed these red flags out. This situation just demonstrates
how crucial it is to have citizen involvement in every step of the process. Transparency
is key in demonstrating contract award responsibility.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DOE has no plans to cancel or postpone its public
meetings on radioactive recycling, which currently are slated to begin on July 31 and will
be held primarily in locations and venues that are typically friendly to the nuclear
industry. For instance, the meeting in Oak Ridge is to be held at the American Museum of
Science and Energy &#150; previously known as the American Museum of Atomic Energy, which
is part of the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory nuclear complex.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The release of radioactive metals into public
commerce is of national concern, &quot; said Trisha Christopher, program assistant for
Alliance for Nuclear Accountability. &quot;Public hearings should accurately reflect those
communities that will be directly affected. The SAIC documents, as well as the contract
for the company that is approved to perform the PEIS, should be made public to allow
concerned citizens to study those materials well before any public scoping meetings occur.
The selection of a PEIS contractor can say a lot about the agency's actual goals.&quot;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Added Public Citizen policy analyst David Ritter:
&quot;The only acceptable outcome to this PEIS &#150; one that prioritizes public health
over the desires of the nuclear industry &#150; will be a permanent and unambiguous ban on
the release or recycling of all radioactive materials and contaminated property. To
legalize the recycling of radioactivity into consumer products indicates a callous
disregard for public health.&quot; </font><font face="Times New Roman">
