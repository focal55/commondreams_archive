- September 7 - The top three corporations competing to
take over the city of New Orleans&#146; water and sewer systems have tarnished records
that, combined, include connections to criminal wrongdoing, suspect relationships with
government officials, infliction of environmental damage, failures to maintain equipment,
and the delivery of substandard customer service, a Public Citizen report reveals.
<p>The report, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/press/Big%20Greedy%20(PDF).PDF" target="_new"><i>The Big Greedy</i></a>, details the
unseemly histories of three multinational corporations likely to submit bids to operate
the water and sewage systems for nearly half a million people in New Orleans, in what
would be the largest public works privatization in U.S. history. The winning company,
expected to be chosen next spring, will run the system for up to 20 years and take in an
estimated $1 billion in revenues. All three corporations are either subsidiaries of or
maintain intimate business relationships with foreign-based conglomerates that are
aggressively acquiring water and other utility services throughout the world. </p>
<p>&quot;Giving a precious public resource to private interests is distasteful to begin
with, but handing over New Orleans&#146; entire water system to one of these companies
would set a new standard for governmental negligence,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director
of Public Citizen&#146;s <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/" target="_new">Critical Mass Energy and
Environment Program</a>. &quot;City officials need to seriously reevaluate their actions - particularly because multinational corporations hold the interests
of their overseas shareholders above the interests of local communities.&quot;</p>
<p>Public Citizen does not believe that New Orleans residents would benefit from
privatization of their water and wastewater systems. Evidence indicates that private
operation or ownership of such systems fosters corruption and often results in rate hikes,
poor customer service and a loss of local control and accountability.</p>
<p>Following an emerging trend among local governments, the New Orleans Sewerage &amp;
Water Board (S&amp;WB) decided last year to hire a private company to operate the
city&#146;s water and sewage systems. A team of financial analysts concluded that a
corporation could do a better job than the city of minimizing rate increases that will
result from $1.3 billion worth of necessary repairs to the systems. The S&amp;WB will
continue to set water and sewer rates, but the system otherwise will be privatized. </p>
<p>Though no formal bids have been submitted to run the systems -
which include 1,610 miles of water pipes, 1,450 miles of sewer pipes, 105 pumping stations
and two treatment plants - representatives from three
corporations, including U.S. Filter, which already operates the city&#146;s sewer system,
have toured the facilities. The track records of all three corporations have been sullied
by various misdeeds:</p>
</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OMI Inc. of Greenwood, Colo. -
Last year, the City Council of Biddeford, Maine, withheld payment from OMI until the
company fixed a chronic odor problem at the city&#146;s sewage treatment plant.<u> </u>This
year, the county executive of Bergen County, N.J., was accused of trying to privatize the
county&#146;s wastewater system to pay back his campaign contributors, which included OMI,
its parent company and its law firm. OMI is planning to submit its bid with Thames Water,
a British water giant recently acquired by German energy giant RWE.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United Water Resources of Harrington Park, N. J. - In 1996, a top executive of United Water&#146;s parent company,
Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux of France, was sent to prison, along with government officials in
Grenoble, for bribery in connection with a contract award. Last year, United Water
executives from several states donated more than $10,000 to the brother of Atlanta Mayor
Bill Campbell, who was running for state auditor of North Carolina. It was just two years
earlier that United Water won a $21 million contract in Atlanta, where local officials and
residents have since complained about broken fire hydrants, slow service and brown water
with flecks of debris.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Filter of Warrendale, Penn. - In 1997, executives of U.S. Filter&#146;s parent company, Vivendi
Environnement of France, were convicted of bribing the mayor of St-Denis to obtain a water
concession. Last year, U.S. Filter shareholders took Vivendi to court over allegedly
illegal payments made to U.S Filter executives to win support for Vivendi&#146;s takeover
of the company. Last month, an electrical fire at one of the sewage treatment plants that
U.S. Filter operates in New Orleans caused raw sewage to be dumped into the Mississippi
River for two hours. According to a City Council member, the company was aware of the
problems that led to the fire but didn&#146;t address them.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p>&quot;If these shenanigans don&#146;t make elected officials in New Orleans run as fast
as they can in the opposite direction, they aren&#146;t thinking straight,&quot; Hauter
said. &quot;The water supply of New Orleans should not be entrusted to these
companies.&quot;</p>
<p>The conduct of these corporations aside, the privatization process itself has been
questioned by local civic organizations and leaders. Among the criticisms, the S&amp;WB
gave local residents just 10 days to file comments on the bidding documents when they were
released in February. In response to a public outcry, the board eventually extended the
comment period to four months. </p>
<p>Additionally, the New Orleans Bureau of Governmental Research (BGR) said the bidding
documents were flawed because certain protocols were missing, bidders were not required to
disclose campaign contributions or reveal potential conflicts of interest, and certain
provisions encouraged patronage. Some of the disputed provisions made their way into the
final draft of the bidding documents. The BGR also expressed concern that the city&#146;s
financial advisors did not conduct apples-to-apples comparisons between the New Orleans
situation and privatization cases elsewhere. And, the BGR found that analysts provided no
specific evidence that the city would really save money through privatization.</p>
