- June 6 -  A 90-page Consumer Federation of America study,
released this morning, concludes that California has the most
pro-consumer auto insurance regulation in the nation.  The report found that the
provisions of Proposition 103 -- passed by California voters in 1988 --
led to the creation of a regulatory system that benefitted both consumers
and insurers alike.

<p>"Prop. 103 created a system with higher profits, lower rate
increases, and more rapid declines in assigned rate drivers than in any
other state," said J. Robert Hunter, CFA's Director of Insurance and
former Texas Insurance Commissioner, who prepared the study.  "Instead of
eagerly embracing industry deregulation proposals, state insurance commissioners should look to California for guidance about how to effectively regulate personal lines of insurance," he added.

<p>Consumers spend, on average, more on auto insurance than on any
other type of insurance
-- annually, an average of more than $700 per car and more than $1,500
per
household -- well over $100 billion nationwide.  Their concern about
rising
auto insurance rates, more than any other factor, led to voter approval
of
the California initiative which insurers spent tens of millions of
dollars
trying to defeat.

<p><b>California Drivers Gain Lower Rates While Insurers Profit
</b>
<p>After passage of Prop. 103, California drivers received rate
rollbacks totaling $1.3 billion.  But their greatest gain was rates that

declined over the next decade.  From 1989 to 1998, auto insurance rates
declined by 4 percent in California while they were rising by more than
25
percent in the rest of the country.  That decline represents the lowest
rate
of change of any state in the nation.

<p>During the same period, California auto insurers were enjoying
healthy profits.  A calculation of annual return on net worth from 1990
to
1999 reveals that these insurers received 16.0 percent compared to only
10.9
percent received by auto insurers nationally.

<p><b>More Competition and Smarter Regulation Explain Lower Rates
</b>
<p>Despite industry opposition, Prop. 103 created a system mixing
greater competition with smarter regulation and greater consumer
participation.  The result was lower consumer rates and higher industry
profits.


<p>Greater Competition:  To promote competition, the initiative
eliminated the state antitrust exemption, allowed banks to sell
insurance,
allowed groups to make purchases collectively, enabled
insurance agents to rebate part of their commissions, and greatly
improved
consumer information.
In regard to the latter, Prop. 103 required the California Commissioner
to
provide consumers with a current rate comparison survey for all personal

lines of insurance.

<p>Smarter Regulation:  Prop. 103 required insurers to open their books
to justify rate increases or decreases.  For the first time in the
state,
insurers were provided with financial incentives for efficient
performance.
Most importantly, this "prior approval" regulatory system effectively
ended
the traditional "cost-plus" method of insurer pricing in which there was

little incentive for insurers to restrain losses and operate
efficiently.
Insurers began to actively hold down costs.

<p>Prop. 103 also provided consumers with "good driver" incentives
while reducing the discriminatory impact of risk factors over which
drivers
had little or no control.  "Clean" drivers received a 20 percent
discount
and also the right to purchase insurance from the company of their
choice
through the initiative's "good driver protections."  This was an
important
reason that the proportion of those who were uninsured or insured in the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan dropped from by more than 50%
from
1989 to 1999.

<p>Greater Consumer Participation:  Prop. 103 also allowed greater
consumer participation by providing funding for consumer intervention if
the
intervenors make a "substantial contribution" to the case.  This
provision
not only helped empower California consumers; it also helped keep
insurance
regulators honest.

<p><b>Insurer Criticism of Prop. 103 Is Weak
</b>
<p>The insurance industry and its partisans offer weak criticism of
Prop. 103.  That criticism  includes the claim that the initiative
allowed
them to gain excessive profits.  They argue that, had insurers been free
to
increase rates without regulatory approval, they would have lowered
their
prices even more than they did, knowing that they could later increase
rates
freely if conditions changed.

<p>However, insurer profits were high not only because Prop. 103
rationalized the regulatory system but also because of the generosity of

Insurance Commissioner Quackenbush to the industry.  Quackenbush,
commissioner from 1995 to 2000, refused to investigate, let alone limit,

insurer profits.  Later, it became clear that some of the same companies
who
benefited from the Commissioner's refusal to use his regulatory powers
under
103 were companies that provided money to various slush funds he was
amassing outside of government in exchange for favors.

<p>Insurers also argue that greater use of seat belts in California was
largely responsible for lower rates in that state.  However, data show
that,
from 1989 to 1998, seatbelt use in California rose by only 34 percent
while
it was rising by 54 percent in the rest of the country.

<p><b>CFA Calls On Insurance Regulators to Consider California System
</b>
<p>"As the NAIC studies personal lines regulation, it should not simply
deregulate the current non-competitive systems," said Hunter.  "Instead,

NAIC should adopt the sort of full competition and excellent regulatory
backup that Prop. 103 has provided for California's consumers.  Why not
the
best for all the people of America?" Hunter asked.

<p>CFA will be distributing copies of the report at the upcoming
National Association of Insurance Commissioners' meeting in New Orleans
this
weekend.  It also will be mailing copies to each state regulator.
Finally,
it will be distributing copies to national policymakers and other
experts
concerned about insurance regulation.
