- February 26 - The new administration of George
W. Bush has made it clear that it will continue the
most inhumane, destructive, and wasteful military
policies of the Clinton years.

<p>An equal danger is that many or most Democrats in
Congress will support these policies, in bipartisan
cooperation -- confirming the criticism from the Green
Party that there's basic agreement and little debate
between the two major parties on many of the most
important issues.

<p>These policies include:

<p>*** Iraq:  Air strikes by the U.S. have continued
regularly against Iraq since December, 1998, as
ordered by President Clinton, and now with the
February 16 raid by ordered President Bush.  But the
bombing assaults, like the sanctions, have failed in
their objective to dislodge the murderous Saddam
Hussein, and have resulted in over a million Iraqi
civilian deaths (180 deaths of children each day,
according to UNICEF).  These deaths are the result of
destroyed infrastructure, withheld food and medicine,
and the bombs themselves.  The U.S., with the lone
support of Great Britain, refuses to consult the Gulf
War Alliance of many other nations on the air strikes,
thus violating international law.

<p>Iraq continues to suffer huge casualties in cancer
(especially leukemia), tumors, and infection, probable
results of the U.S.'s use of radio-active depleted
uranium in shell casings, bullets, and bombs during
the Persian Gulf War.  Thousands of American and other
NATO soldiers have suffered the same effects; Clinton
also allowed the use of depleted uranium in weapons in
assaults against Serbs in Serbia, Kosovo, and Bosnia. 
But the U.S. refuses to take responsibility for the
deadly effects of depleted uranium.  The Pentagon
ignores demands by NATO allies that the U.S. reveal
the chemical and radio-active properties of American
weapons, and refuses to test American soldiers who
were stationed in the Persian Gulf area and the
Balkans.

<p>The Pentagon called the February 16 air strikes
"protective retaliation."  George W. Bush, Secretary
of State Colin Powell, and Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld have thus added their own Orwellian twist to
the atrocious policies of the Clinton Administration. 
Green Party members will continue to protest and lobby
against the air attacks and sanctions. 

<p>*** Plan Colombia:  The U.S., under Clinton and now
Bush, is sending $1.3 billion in Plan Colombia aid to
fight the War on Drugs.  But thanks to the Colombian
armed force's close ties to right-wing
para-militaries, American taxpayers' money is
implicated in the violent suppression of Colombian
civilians.  In January, 2001, these paramilitaries
were responsible for 27 massacres, leaving at least
200 dead. 

<p>The Clinton-Bush policy of attacking the sources of
Colombian drug exports does nothing to address the
hunger of millions of Americans for cocaine and other
drugs.  Instead, the War on Drugs and Plan Colombia
have (1) threatened to displace up to 100,000
civilians and threaten the human rights and security
of millions of Colombians; (2) caused extensive
environmental destruction, especially from the use of
aerial fumigation -- sprayed chemicals that kill not
just coca but all plant and animal life -- in
Colombia's Amazon basin; and (3) increased guerrilla
warfare and the likelihood of direct U.S. military
involvement.

<p>Greens have strongly opposed and protested Plan
Colombia and the War on Drugs, and have supported the
Colombian people in their democratic vote on October
28, 2000 to reject Plan Colombia. 

<p>*** Anti-ballistic missile defense: In naming Donald
Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense, President Bush in
effect hired a lobbyist for defense industries and for
space-based national missile defense (NMD).  Formerly
called the Strategic Defense Initiative and "Star
Wars," NMD began as a pipe dream of Ronald Reagan,
soon discredited by missile intercept tests (and
tampering of test results).  Bill Clinton revived it
with bipartisan support, the (Donald) Rumsfeld Report,
a 1998 commission study, asserted its urgency in the
defense against "rogue states" like North Korea, and
both George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigned in its
favor in 2000.  President Bush promises rapid
implementation of NMD, and has the bipartisan blessing
of Congress.

<p>The patently fraudulent and failure-prone basis of NMD
-- and the ease by which nuclear and other massively
destructive weapons can be deployed without the use of
missiles -- suggests that the real motivation for NMD
is an enormous boondoggle for defense contractors. 
More testing failures (most recently on July 8, 2000)
and the rapid diffusion of technology, whether from
espionage or "free trade" sales of technological
secrets to other nations (such as China under the
Clinton Adminstration) ensure NMD's continued
uselessness, except as a conduit of taxpayer money to
defense industries.

<p>Even if NMD proved successful, its deployment would
undermine agreements with Russia and other nations to
reduce nuclear weapons.  For that reason, nations
around the world have blasted U.S. efforts to revive
NMD.  Greens have joined this opposition, and Green
candidate Ralph Nader spoke out against it during his
2000 campaign.

<p>The Association of State Green Parties, in its
commitment to nonviolences, stated in its 2000
platform:

<p>"With the end of the Cold War has come a more complex
set of challenges in how our nation defines its
NATIONAL SECURITY. Our present task is to rid
ourselves of the residue of the geopolitical conflict
of East versus West, with its bloated defense budgets,
thousands of unneeded nuclear weapons and major troop
deployments overseas. Greens support sustainable
development and social and economic justice across the
globe. Reducing militarism and reliance on arms
policies is the key to progress toward collective
security."

<p>"We oppose structural and direct violence of all
kinds: assaults against individuals, families, nations
and cultures, the environment and the biosphere.... 
Preventive diplomacy, a strong economy and humane
trade relations are our best defense.  We must
maintain a viable American military force, prudent
foreign policy doctrines, and readiness strategies
that take into account real, not hollow or imagined 
threats to our people, our democratic institutions and
U.S. interests.  Even so, Greens seek strength through
peace."
