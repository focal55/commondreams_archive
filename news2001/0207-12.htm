- February 7 - As President Bush continued to push his tax cut plan today with
families he said would gain from it, the National Women's Law
Center criticized the Administration's proposal for leaving
low-income families out of its potential benefits. If there is to
be a tax cut, any proposed "marriage penalty fix" should be
extended to include low-income couples and the child tax credit and
the child and dependent care tax credit should be made refundable.
These measures would allow families who do not earn enough income
to pay taxes to also benefit, said NWLC.
<p>In responding to President Bush's comment that he wants to
dismantle the "toll booth on the road to the middle class," Nancy
Duff Campbell, NWLC Co-President, said, "Unfortunately this plan
has ignored the many roadblocks that remain for low-income
families, so many of whom are headed by women."
<p>For example, Campbell praised Bush's approach to fixing the
marriage penalty -- which currently causes some married couples to
pay higher taxes than they would if they were single -- by allowing
them to deduct from their taxable income up to $3,000 of the second
earner's pay. By structuring the marriage penalty fix in this way,
the plan targets middle-income couples with two earners. However,
low-income couples that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit are hit
with the most substantial marriage penalties, but get little or no
relief under Bush's plan. "President Bush's second-earner
deduction approach works for many middle-income couples, but fails
to recognize that low-income couples are also penalized when they
marry. It's only fair that they are included in the marriage
penalty fix," said Campbell.
<p>Campbell also expressed support for the President's move to
increase the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000 per child,
because it recognizes the greater expenses of families with
children, but criticized the proposal for not making the child tax
credit refundable so that low-income families, who are most in need
of help in meeting these expenses, would benefit.
<p>In addition, the Administration's proposal fails to recognize
that one of the largest expenses for working families is child
care. Yet, the child and dependent care tax credit, which helps
families pay for these expenses, has not even been increased for
inflation since 1981. For this reason, bipartisan legislation has
been introduced in Congress to increase the credit and make it
refundable so that the lowest income families can get help with
their child care costs. "Real tax relief for families would
address one of the largest expenses for families -- child care,"
said Campbell.
<p>Campbell reiterated that the Administration's plan, as a whole,
is unfairly skewed toward tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Campbell criticized the President's
move to eliminate the estate tax because it would benefit only the
top five percent of tax filers and do nothing for the overwhelming
majority of women and their families who do not stand to gain from
inherited wealth. In a statement issued Monday, Campbell said that
the size of the proposed tax cut poses a serious threat to Social
Security, Medicare and other safety net programs, including the
need to make increased investments in areas critical to women and
their families such as education, child care and health care.
<p>Campbell has over 30 years' experience in tax law and policy,
especially as it pertains to women and their families. She serves
on the board of the Community Tax Law Report and chaired the
national Coalition on Women and Taxes during the 1986 tax reform
debates.
<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-partisan, non-profit
organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and
protect women's legal rights. NWLC focuses on major policy areas
of importance to women and their families including economic
security, education, employment and health, with special attention
given to the concerns of low-income women. </i>
