The Interview with Jerry Falwell:<BR>
<BR>
PAT ROBERTSON:  Well after Tuesday's attacks, many Americans are struggling with grief, fear and unanswered questions.  How should Christians respond to this crisis?  Well joining us now with some answers is a dear friend of ours, the Pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church and Liberty University, the head and founder of that, Dr. Jerry Falwell.  Jerry, it's a delight to have you with us today.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  Thanks, Pat.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Listen.  What are you telling the church?  You called your church together.  What was your response at Thomas Road to this tragedy?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  Well, as the world knows, the tragedy hit on Tuesday morning, and at 2:00 in the afternoon, we gathered 7,000 Liberty University students, faculty, local people together, and we used the verse that I heard you use a moment ago, Chronicles II, 7:14, that God wanted us to humble ourselves and seek his face.  And there's not much we can do in the Church but what we're supposed to do, and that is pray.  Pray for the President that God will give him wisdom, keep bad advisors from him, bring good ones to him, praying for the families of the victims, praying for America.  And, you know this thing is not a great deal different than what I remember and you Pat.  We're about the same age.  December 7, 1941, when we entered the war against Japan, Germany, Italy. Hitler's goal was to destroy the Jews among other things, and conquer the world.  And, these Islamic fundamentalists, these radical terrorists, these Middle Eastern monsters are committed to destroying the Jewish nation, driving her into the Mediterranean, conquering the world.  And, we are the great Satan.  We are the ultimate goal.  I talked this morning with Tom Rose publisher of the Jerusalem Post, and orthodox Jew, and he said, "Now America knows in a horrible way what Israel's been facing for 53 years at the hand of Arafat and other terrorists and radicals and barbarians.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Jerry, I know that you shared several 40 day fasts for revival in America.  We here at CBN had a couple of 40 day fasts during the Lenten season, and Bill Bright, I don't know, eight or nine.  Do you think that this is going to be the trigger of revival, a real revival in the Church where we truly turn back to God with all our heart?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  It could be.  I've never sensed a togetherness, a burden, a broken heart as I do in the Church today, and just 48 hours, I gave away a booklet I wrote 10 years ago.  I gave it away last night on the Biblical position on fasting and prayer because I do believe that that is what we've got to do now-- fast and pray.  And I agree totally with you that the Lord has protected us so wonderfully these 225 years.  And since 1812, this is the first time that we've been attacked on our soil, first time, and by far the worst results.  And I fear, as Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense said yesterday, that this is only the beginning.  And with biological warfare available to these monsters; the Husseins, the Bin Ladens, the Arafats, what we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact, if in fact God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Jerry, that's my feeling.  I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror.  We haven't even begun to see what they can do to the major population.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  The ACLU's got to take a lot of blame for this.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Well, yes.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  And, I know that I'll hear from them for this.  But, throwing God out successfully with the help of the federal court system, throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools.  The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked.  And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad.  I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America.  I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen'.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Well, I totally concur, and the problem is we have adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government.  And so we're responsible as a free society for what the top people do.  And, the top people, of course, is the court system.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  Amen.  Pat, did you notice yesterday?  The ACLU, and all the Christ-haters, the People For the American Way, NOW, etc. were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress as they went out on the steps and called out on to God in prayer and sang 'God Bless America' and said 'let the ACLU be hanged'.  In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time- calling upon God.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Amen.  I wanted to ask you the reaction.  I know that you had a major prayer meeting last night, and I know your people assembled, just a large gathering at your church.  What was the mood of the people?  What did they say and what did you sense with your congregation?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  A brokenness that I have not seen.  I've been there pastor 45 years, 30 years Chancellor at Liberty.  We had 7,000 gather yesterday in the Vines Center and filled the Church last night.  I sensed a brokenness, tears.  People were sobbing at the alter.  And, they have no shame about it.  It was the kind of brokenness that no one could conjure, only God could bring upon us.  And, that is to me the most optimistic thing that I see today as I look across America.  And every city, I called a friend in Springfield yesterday.  He said at least a hundred churches, Springfield, MO, at least a hundred churches have special prayer meetings for America today and tonight.  And, that's happening by the thousands all over America.  This could be, if we will fast and pray, this could be God's call to revival.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Well, I believe it. And I think the people, the Bible says render your hearts and not your garments, and people begin to render their hearts and they weep before the Lord, and they really get serious with God, God will hear and answer.  We'll see revival.  I am thrilled to hear that about your church because it's happening all over.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  It's everywhere.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Yes.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  In the most unlikely of places.  The general manager at the ABC affiliate in our area called me this morning and said "we're going to ask for all the churches, all the people of faith to join us at the D-Day Memorial over in Bedford at 2:00, Sunday.  And, Randy Smith is his name, the general manager, and he is calling central Virginia to healing through prayer and I suspect there will be thousands there.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Jerry, this is so encouraging, and I thank God for your stand.  We just love you and praise God for you.  Liberty is a great institution and I congratulate you for that wonderful student body, and your church.  And, thank-you my dear friend for being with us.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
JERRY FALWELL:  God bless you brother.  Let's stand together.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PAT ROBERTSON:  Amen
