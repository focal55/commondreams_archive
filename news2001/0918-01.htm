<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 
- September 18 -  
As Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri 
prepared to meet President Bush, the Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN) 
and the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) urged the Bush administration not 
to strengthen ties with the Indonesian military. Citing ongoing human 
rights abuses and lack of accountability for violations, the groups said 
renewing military relations with Indonesia would set back reform efforts 
and democracy in Indonesia while undermining East Timor's security.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In its drive to build an international coalition in response to the 
horrible attacks in New York and Washington, the U.S. must not sacrifice 
the rights of Indonesians and East Timorese,&quot; said Kurt Biddle, Washington 
Coordinator for IHRN. &quot;Renewal of military ties with the brutal Indonesian 
military will only encourage their terror tactics against the people of 
Aceh, West Papua and elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since Megawati assumed Indonesia's presidency in late July, the Bush 
administration has stepped up efforts to restore a closer relationship 
between the Pentagon and the Indonesian military (TNI). She is scheduled to 
meet President Bush on Wednesday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Megawati has belatedly recognized East Timor's independence and recently 
met its leaders. However, the Indonesian military, which played an active 
role in the destabilization of her predecessor, continues to thwart 
attempts at democratic reform,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We feel great sorrow for the loss of life in New York, Washington, DC, and 
Pennsylvania. We also mourn the loss of East Timorese and Indonesian lives 
at the hands of the Indonesian military. At this time, the U.S. government 
must continue to withhold aid for this deadly force.  Increased assistance 
for the TNI by the U.S. military will only lead to further loss of innocent 
civilians,&quot; said Biddle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to the horrific attacks on September 11, IHRN canceled its planned 
public demonstration at the Indonesian Embassy during President Megawati's 
visit to Washington. The group stressed, however, that their message to Ms. 
Megawati remains the same.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Indonesian military has answered to no one for their crimes against 
humanity and they continue to kill hundreds of civilians. Nothing has 
changed as far as human rights are concerned. Now is not the time to reward 
this brutal force,&quot; said Biddle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States has withheld most military assistance from Indonesia 
since the TNI and its militia proxies razed East Timor in September 1999 
after it voted overwhelmingly for independence. Congress restricted most 
military assistance through the &quot;Leahy conditions,&quot; first passed in late 
1999. These conditions include the safe return of East Timorese refugees, 
prosecution of those responsible for atrocities in East Timor and 
Indonesia, and security for East Timor from military and militia activity. 
None of these conditions have been met. The full U.S. House of 
Representatives and the Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to 
renew these restrictions, with the Senate committee adding additional 
conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last spring, James Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, told 
Congress, &quot;To date, the Government of Indonesia has not met the 
requirements of the Leahy amendment in pursuing accountability for human 
rights abuses by the TNI in East Timor or elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesian military and police continue to commit atrocities throughout 
the island nation. In Aceh, the armed forces' campaign against the local 
population continues. On August 9 in the town of Julok, armed men lined up 
local civilians and shot to death at least 30 men, wounding another nine. 
Eyewitnesses say the killers were TNI troops. Over 1,200 people, mostly 
civilians, have been killed in Aceh since the beginning of the year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although some refugees recently returned to East Timor, up to 80,000 remain 
trapped in poor conditions in Indonesian West Timor under the control of 
militia. Last week's return of refugees is the result of ongoing 
negotiations with militia leader, Cancio Lopes de Carvalho, who has 
declared his acceptance of East Timor's independence and offered to tell 
what he knows about the generals who ordered the 1999 violence. Other 
militia leaders, backed by elements of the Indonesian military, are 
reported to be biding their time in West Timor, awaiting a U.N. draw-down 
or withdrawal, before launching additional military raids across the border.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;East Timor has experienced terror of its own. Hundreds of thousands were 
killed, most of its infrastructure destroyed, and one-quarter of its 
population forcibly deported. The perpetrators of these crimes are well 
known,&quot; said Miller.  &quot;An international tribunal is the only way to bring 
to justice those who committed crimes against humanity in East Timor for so 
long.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Megawati administration's recently-amended decree establishing a 
special human rights court on East Timor in Indonesia falls far short of 
fully addressing the military's role in orchestrating the violence and 
devastation. Without an international tribunal, those most responsible for 
Indonesia's scorched earth campaign in East Timor will escape punishment,&quot; 
he added.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April, former Indonesian president Wahid issued a decree limiting the 
jurisdiction of the special court to crimes committed after the August 30, 
1999 popular consultation in East Timor. Megawati's expanded decree 
restricts the court's jurisdiction to crimes committed in Liquica, Dili, 
and Suai in the months of April and September 1999.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IHRN also pointed to the rise of political detainees and prisoners. 
&quot;Indonesia has regressed to the Suharto-era practice of arresting and 
imprisoning peaceful political dissidents,&quot; said Kurt Biddle. &quot;The military 
is attacking villagers as the police target the activists.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In August, Acehnese student activist Faisal Syaifuddin was arrested in 
Jakarta. In July, Kautsar [ed: one name] was arrested at a peaceful 
demonstration against ExxonMobil's human rights abuses in Aceh. Both 
activists are charged with &quot;inciting hatred&quot; against the government and are 
awaiting trial. Since mid-June, police have held 19 activists in Bandung, 
West Java for their involvement in protests of oil price increases. Eight 
people are being detained for distributing leaflets in Surabaya, East Java, 
including two provincial parliament representatives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) supports human dignity for the 
people of East Timor by advocating for democracy, sustainable development, 
social, legal, and economic justice and human rights, including women's 
rights. ETAN, which has 28 local chapters throughout the U.S., calls for an 
international tribunal to prosecute crimes against humanity which took 
place in East Timor since 1975. For additional information see ETAN's web 
site (<a href="http://www.etan.org" target="_new">http://www.etan.org</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN) is a U.S.-based grassroots 
organization working to educate and activate the American public and 
influence U.S. foreign policy and international economic interests to 
support democracy, demilitarization, and justice through accountability and 
rule of law in Indonesia. IHRN seeks to end armed forces repression in 
Indonesia by exposing it to international scrutiny. IHRN works with and 
advocates on behalf of people throughout the Indonesian archipelago to 
strengthen civil society. See <a href="http://www.IndonesiaNetwork.org" target="_new">www.IndonesiaNetwork.org</a> for more information.
