<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- January 16 - Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer and Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger delivered this letter today to Chairman Patrick Leahy and other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding the nomination of former Senator John Ashcroft to be Attorney General.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;January 16, 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Patrick Leahy<br>
        Chairman<br>
        Senate Judiciary Committee<br>
        224 Dirksen Senate Office Building<br>
        Washington, DC 20510</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator Leahy:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">          As the chief law 
        enforcement officer of the nation, the Attorney General of the United 
        States is charged, among other duties, with the criminal enforcement of 
        the federal campaign finance laws.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These laws are of central 
        importance in protecting the integrity of our political process and protecting 
        citizens against corruption and the appearance of corruption of the nation’s 
        elected leaders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Based on the record and positions 
        of Attorney General-nominee John Ashcroft, we believe that basic questions 
        exist about whether he would be a credible and serious enforcer of the 
        nation’s anti-corruption laws, and whether he would defend these laws 
        in the courts.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe, furthermore, that 
        these questions are all the more important given the controversial track 
        record of the current Justice Department in failing to effectively enforce 
        the campaign finance laws.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We therefore strongly urge 
        the Judiciary Committee, and the Senate as a whole, to carefully examine 
        former Senator Ashcroft’s record in this area, in the course of considering 
        his nomination to be Attorney General. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Senator Ashcroft’s 
        record shows that he disagrees with the federal campaign finance laws 
        he would be charged with enforcing.  And he believes that important campaign 
        finance reform measures under consideration in Congress, which he would 
        be charged with defending in the courts if enacted, are unconstitutional. 
        </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His record also shows that 
        he engaged in a major evasion of federal campaign finance laws in his 
        Senate race last year by directly raising in his own name soft money contributions 
        that were then channeled through national and state political party committees 
        and spent to help his Senate campaign.  This evasion resulted in the solicitation 
        and receipt of soft money contributions from corporate interests and others 
        with important case-specific matters pending in the Justice Department.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal candidates are prohibited 
        from raising and spending soft money in their campaigns.  While other 
        Senate Democratic and Republican candidates also engaged last year in 
        the same kind of evasive — and we believe illegal — conduct undertaken 
        by Senator Ashcroft, none of these other individuals is under consideration 
        to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Ashcroft has made 
        clear that he disagrees with core provisions of the existing campaign 
        finance laws. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997 remarks to the Claremont 
        Institute, for example, Senator Ashcroft said, “I don’t believe we should 
        limit what people can give to politics.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The limits on what individuals 
        can give to candidates and political parties, however, were enacted in 
        1974 in response to huge contributions made during the Watergate scandals.  
        These limits have been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as necessary 
        to protect against corruption and the appearance of corruption. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Justice David Souter wrote 
        earlier this year, in an opinion joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
        and reaffirming the constitutionality of contribution limits, “[T]here 
        is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work 
        actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the 
        existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.” </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Souter further wrote 
        that, “Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered and the cynical 
        assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness 
        of voters to take part in democratic governance.” </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Attorney General, former 
        Senator Ashcroft also would be charged with defending in the courts the 
        constitutionality of any new campaign finance laws enacted by Congress.  
        </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet Ashcroft has taken the 
        position that the McCain-Feingold legislation to ban soft money, the principal 
        campaign finance reform measure under consideration in Congress, is “flatly 
        unconstitutional” and constitutes “the banning of political speech.”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These remarks 
        raise the basic question as to whether former Senator Ashcroft would act 
        to ensure that the Justice Department defended the constitutionality of 
        the McCain-Feingold bill if it is enacted into law and challenged in the 
        courts.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Senator Ashcroft’s 
        evasion of federal campaign finance laws in the last election raises basic 
        questions about how vigorously he would pursue campaign finance violators 
        and how credible he would be in carrying out this responsibility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ashcroft established for his 
        last campaign the “Ashcroft Victory Committee,” a so-called “joint fundraising” 
        committee with his party which was designed to raise and funnel federally 
        illegal “soft money” into his 2000 Senate campaign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee raised money 
        from sources that cannot legally support federal candidates, such as corporations, 
        and in amounts in excess of the federal contribution limits.  The soft 
        money was then transferred to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, 
        which then transferred the money to the Missouri Republican party, which 
        then spent the money on so-called “issue ads” that were clearly designed 
        to promote Mr. Ashcroft’s Senate campaign. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words, the Ashcroft 
        Victory Fund was simply a vehicle for Senator Ashcroft </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to raise soft money in his 
        own name and then to knowingly launder this money through his political 
        party into his reelection campaign effort.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe this practice violated 
        the federal campaign finance laws.  But even if this practice was not 
        illegal, it represents a blatant evasion of federal campaign finance prohibitions 
        and limits designed to protect against corruption by an individual who 
        as Attorney General would be charged with enforcing these laws.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The soft money raised by the 
        Ashcroft Victory Committee also raises serious questions about case-specific 
        conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts for Ashcroft 
        if he were to serve as Attorney General. These questions need to be addressed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, Ashcroft’s Victory 
        Committee last year received $10,000 in corporate soft money from Microsoft 
        Corporation.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How would former Senator Ashcroft 
        resolve the apparent conflict of interest between the corporate contribution 
        he raised from Microsoft and his responsibilities as Attorney General 
        to make decisions regarding the Justice Department’s landmark lawsuit 
        against Microsoft, now pending in the federal court of appeals?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, Ashcroft’s Victory 
        Committee received a $25,000 soft money contribution from the National 
        Rifle Association.  The Justice Department is currently defending against 
        lawsuits that have been brought by gun control opponents to challenge 
        federal gun control laws. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How would former Senator Ashcroft 
        resolve the apparent conflict of interest between the soft money contribution 
        he raised from the NRA and his responsibilities as Attorney General to 
        defend gun control laws in these cases and in any other cases challenging 
        gun control laws?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Justice Department in 
        recent years has had to decide whether to approve mergers between MCI 
        and WorldCom and MCI and Sprint.  Ashcroft’s Victory Committee received 
        corporate soft money contributions of $10,000 from MCI WorldCom and $10,000 
        from Sprint.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other telecommunications companies, 
        such as AT&amp;T, have been the subjects of Justice Department decision-making 
        in the past. Ashcroft’s Victory Committee received a $25,000 soft money 
        contribution from AT&amp;T. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How would Ashcroft resolve 
        the potential conflicts of interest between the soft money contributions 
        he raised from MCI WorldCom, Sprint and AT&amp;T and any case-specific 
        decisions he might be faced with as Attorney General regarding these companies 
        or regarding mergers in the telecommunications industry that would affect 
        these companies?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are three areas where 
        former Senator Ashcroft’s evasive soft money operation during the 2000 
        election raises serious questions regarding Ashcroft responsibilities 
        as Attorney General that need to be carefully examined. There may be other 
        examples as well that stem from the soft money raised by Ashcroft’s Victory 
        Fund. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a time when there has been 
        great controversy over the Justice Department’s failure to effectively 
        enforce the nation’s campaign finance laws and when Congress may soon 
        take action to strengthen those laws, it is essential that the next Attorney 
        General be a credible enforcer and defender of these laws.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Ashcroft’s record 
        raises serious questions about his ability to fulfill this responsibility. 
        We strongly urge the Senate Judiciary Committee and each Senator to carefully 
        examine this matter in carrying out their responsibilities in the confirmation 
        process.</font></p>
