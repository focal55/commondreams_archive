- October 17 -   The National Community 
Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) joins with Representatives Thomas 
Barrett, Luis Gutierrez, and other key members of Congress in 
urging the federal banking agencies to shore up America's 
communities by updating the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Taylor, President and CEO of NCRC, declares, &quot;As our nation 
faces uncertain economic conditions following September 11, the 
federal banking agencies will provide a shot in the arm for our 
communities if they update the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Passed in 1977, CRA mandates that banks and thrifts meet the 
credit needs of all the communities in which they are chartered and 
from which they take deposits. Federal officials examine banks and 
issue them CRA ratings based upon their number of loans, 
investments, and services offered to residents of low- and 
moderate-income communities. The federal banking agencies are now 
in the process of asking for public comments on whether the CRA 
regulations and examination procedures should be changed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taylor continues, &quot;CRA has leveraged a tremendous increase in 
home mortgage lending for America's working class and minority 
communities during the 1990s. Families realizing the American 
dream of homeownership now face the threat of layoffs or wage 
freezes. Down on their luck, these families are most vulnerable to 
the slick promises of predatory lenders. A stronger CRA is needed 
to protect our communities as well as resume the progress in 
lending and investing.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1990, the federal banking agencies made CRA evaluations and 
ratings public. The agencies also improved the CRA regulations in 
1995 by basing a bank's rating on its performance, instead of its 
process, for making loans, investments, and services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, the Department of Treasury documents that home 
mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income communities is higher 
in areas in which banks undergo CRA exams and in areas in which 
they have CRA agreements and partnerships with community groups. 
In 1990, banks made 18 percent of their home mortgage loans to low- 
and moderate-income borrowers. By 2000, banks made 29 percent of 
their mortgage loans to these borrowers. In CRA agreements with 
community groups, banks have pledged more than $1 trillion dollars 
in loans and investments for working class and minority 
communities, according to NCRC's calculations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, however, the storm clouds of economic uncertainty and 
predatory lending threaten the gains in reinvestment. On a 
national level, the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
found that African-American neighborhoods are five times more 
likely to receive subprime refinance loans than white 
neighborhoods. Neighborhood residents face fewer choices in loan 
products and become more vulnerable to predatory lenders when 
subprime lenders dominate lending in their community. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Archaic CRA examination procedures are making neighborhoods 
vulnerable to predatory lending. Banks are becoming national in 
scope and lending far beyond their branches. But the CRA 
regulations confine CRA exams to assessing performance to only 
areas where banks locate their branches. The Treasury study 
concludes that bank prime lending is higher in areas where they 
undergo CRA exams. In order for CRA to continue leveraging more 
prime lending, it must be updated to examine banks in areas where 
they make the great majority of their loans, not just areas where 
their branches are located,&quot; exclaims NCRC's Taylor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another method by which CRA can increase prime lender presence 
is by explicitly examining lending to minority communities as well 
as to low- and moderate-income communities. The CRA statute 
mandates that banks must be responsive to credit needs in all of 
their communities, including minority ones. Furthermore, since the 
current CRA regulation awards banks for being innovative and 
flexible in response to credit needs, NCRC believes that banks 
should earn more points for prime lending than higher interest 
subprime lending on their CRA exams. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taylor explains, &quot;Subprime refinance and home equity lenders are 
responding to pent up demand in minority communities that is not 
being met by traditional lenders. There is no better way to protect 
minority communities in these uncertain times than by encouraging 
CRA-covered institutions to take market share away from loosely 
regulated subprime lenders.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of the recommendations in NCRC's detailed comment letter 
(available via NCRC's website of <a href="http://www.ncrc.org" target="_new">http://www.ncrc.org</a>) can be 
implemented by the federal banking agencies under authority granted 
to them by the CRA statute. In addition, NCRC reiterates our 
strong support for the CRA Modernization Act, H.R. 865, 
co-sponsored by Representatives Barrett, Gutierrez, and 34 other 
members of Congress. The CRA Modernization Act would update CRA in 
several critical ways such as extending CRA to independent mortgage 
companies, insurance firms, and securities companies. H.R. 865 
would also mandate enhancements to data disclosure that the Federal 
Reserve has proposed but not yet acted upon. These are improving 
HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) to include information on 
interest rates and loan terms and conditions, and enhancing CRA 
small business data to include the race and gender of the small 
business owner. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taylor concludes, &quot;Twice as many community groups as banks have 
sent in comment letters to the federal agencies and have made their 
voices heard regarding the need for a strong CRA. The relatively 
low number of bank comments suggest that they do not mind CRA that 
much, and could be persuaded to support changes to CRA that help 
them compete against subprime lenders. NCRC stands proudly today 
with key members of Congress who also believe that the regulatory 
agencies must act to strengthen CRA so as to strengthen our 
communities.&quot; </font></p>
