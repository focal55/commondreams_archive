- January 9 - <i>"Former Senator John Ashcroft has an extreme anti-environmental record, and
as Attorney General could allow utilities, big oil and others to ignore environmental laws.  He is a partisan, divisive choice for a job that
should be neither, and should not be confirmed.  Ashcroft has opposed
mainstream environmental laws that protect children, workers, and
communities' health from industrial pollution,"</i> said Sierra Club Executive
Director Carl Pope.
<p>
                                 <b>John Ashcroft's Record
</b>
<p>
The Sierra Club opposes the appointment of John Ashcroft as Attorney
General. Ashcroft has a exceedingly poor environmental voting record and is
openly hostile to most environmental laws. Ashcroft voted against
additional funding for environmental programs including the Clean Water Action Plan and toxic waste cleanups at Superfund sites. He also voted for
a bill to roll back clean water protections, to prevent the EPA from
enforcing arsenic standards for drinking water, and to allow mining
companies to dump cyanide and other mining waste on large areas of public
lands next to mining sites.
<p>
Ashcroft also opposes campaign finance reform. He voted against the
McCain-Feingold bill for a complete ban on soft money contributions to
political parties, which would have closed a loophole that allows mining,
timber and other interests to gain influence by contributing huge
unregulated sums of money to political parties.
<p>
                               <b>Fighting Against Clean Air
</b>
<p>
** Supreme Court reviewing soot &amp; smog standards, could review new sulfur
levels in diesel fuel rule **
<p>
Representatives from various industries are challenging current soot and
smog standards, and could challenge sulfur reductions in diesel fuel.  As a
Senator, Ashcroft was a leader in the fight against clean air safeguards.
<p>
As Attorney General, would John Ashcroft defend these same important
standards to protect our clean air, to prevent the increase of childhood
asthma cases, and to clean up the skies over America's cities?
<p>
His record:
    One of only six senators to cosponsor S. 495 in 1999, which would have
amended the Clean Air Act to remove a critical enforcement tool available
to the EPA Administrator when states do not cleanup air pollution problems.
This was a developer-led assault on clean air that, if passed, would have
harmed public health, exacerbated sprawl, and reduced the transportation
choices available to many Americans.
<p>
    Ashcroft was one of only 23 Senators to cosponsor a bill that would
have blocked strong new clean air health standards designed to protect
children, seniors, and other from smog and soot. (S. 1084, 10/22/97)
<p>
    Ashcroft voted to weaken the budget of the Environmental Protection
Agency. The enforcement arm of EPA was especially hard hit; this is crucial
because our nation's environmental laws are only as good as the
enforcement. Ashcroft, as head of the Department of Justice, will be in 
charge of such enforcement actions. (HR 2099, 9/27/95)
<p>
    Ashcroft also voted on Oct. 12, 2000 against stripping a rider that
prohibits the EPA from officially listing localities violating new soot and
smog air standards until June 2001, or until the Supreme Court decides a
case concerning these new standards.
<p>
His campaign contributions:
In his 2000 race for the U.S. Senate in Missouri, John Ashcroft received
more than $380,000 from "Dirty Air" businesses including mining, coal, and
oil groups such as Union Carbide and Exxon. (Environmental Working Group)
<p>
<p>
                       <b>Allowing Polluters to Hide from the Public
</b>
<p>
** The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted for review a large number of high
profile cases in recent years that concern "citizen standing" (citizen
enforcement of environmental laws and public interest laws). **
<p>
Would Senator Ashcroft as Attorney General defend laws that authorize
citizens to enforce environmental and public interest laws?
<p>
His record:
    Voted to allow chemical manufacturers to avoid reporting some of their
toxic pollution under existing "community right-to-know laws." (Motion to
table and amendment to S. 343, 7/13/95)
<p>
His campaign contributions:
In his 2000 race for the U.S. Senate in Missouri, John Ashcroft received
more than $630,000 from "Dirty" PACs - businesses including mining, coal,
and oil groups such as Monsanto and BP Amoco. The analysis by the
Environmental Working Group ranks Senator Ashcroft as the third worst
candidate in the country. (Environmental Working Group)
<p>
<b>Undermining America's National Monuments</b>
<p>
Vice President-Elect Dick Cheney has stated firm opposition to new National
Monuments created by the Clinton Administration.  Many of these national
monuments protect desert wildlands, wetlands, rivers, and wild forests that
would otherwise suffer destruction at the hands of oil, mining, and timber
interests.  Some of these include the Giant Sequoia National Monument (CA),
the Hanford Reach National Monument (WA), and the Grand Canyon-Parashant
National Monument (AZ).
Would Senator Ashcroft as Attorney General defend these monuments from
legal attacks, or will he work to undermine the protection of these areas?
<p>
His record:
    Ashcroft supported an attack on National Monuments, voting for Senator
Don Nickels (R-OK) amendment to undermine the President's authority to
protect spectacular American landscapes by prohibiting the designation of
any new National Monuments unless authorized by Congress. The Nickels'
Amendment to the Department of Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 4578) 
failed on July 18, 2000.
<p>
    Ashcroft voted on several occasions, most recently April 6, 2000, to
open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. The Bush
Administration has called for opening this area up to oil companies.
Senator Ashcroft voted against Sens. Roth (R-DE) and Boxer's (D-CA) attempt
to remove a provision in the Senate FY 2001 budget resolution that assumed
$1.2 billion in anticipated revenue from oil drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. This provision is a backdoor attempt at opening
the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge by Big Oil's Senate allies.
<p>
His campaign contributions:
Senator Ashcroft raised more than $150,000 from timber, mining and other
anti-wilderness groups such as Weyerhaeuser and Texaco.  This fundraising
prowess rates him the fourth worst in the category of Public Land Use Dirty
Money. (Environmental Working Group)
<p>
<b>Jeopardizing Wetlands and Clean Water</b>
<p>
Industry groups are already challenging federal jurisdiction over local 
wetlands under the Clean Water Act and may challenge federal jurisdiction
over local wildlife protections under the Endangered Species Act.
<p>
As Attorney General, would John Ashcroft defend a broad reach of federal
power to allow Congress to protect our natural heritage, or would he seek
to circumvent them?
<p>
His record:
    While in the Senate, Ashcroft voted against additional funding for
environmental programs including the Clean Water Action Plan and toxic
waste cleanups at Superfund sites. (Lautenberg amendment to S.C.R. 86,
04/02/98)
<p>
    Ashcroft cosponsored S. 2417, an attack on a key enforcement component
of the Clean Water Act, the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program to
clean up run off water pollution. For many years, states and EPA largely
ignored this critical program.  In recent years, lawsuits brought by
environmental groups have compelled EPA and the states to start meeting 
their responsibilities under the TMDL program to identify and restore
impaired waters.  As a result of the new attention to TMDLs, the program
has come under attack by special interest industry groups.
<p>
    Ashcroft voted against an amendment that would delete two
anti-environmental riders attached to the EPA's funding bill. One rider 
delays the EPA's efforts to decrease levels of arsenic, a known carcinogen,
in drinking water. Research by the National Academy of Science concluded
that the current drinking water standard for arsenic is too high and should
be revised downward as "promptly as possible" (H.R. 2099, 09/27/95).
<p>
<p>
His campaign contributions:
Senator Ashcroft raised more than $160,000 from fertilizer producers,
miners, and other anti-clean water groups such as Occidental Petroleum and
DuPont.  This fundraising prowess rates him the second worst in the
category of Dirty Water Money. (Environmental Working Group)
<p>
<b>Degrading America's Wild Lands</b>
<p>
President Clinton recently signed a Wild Forest Protection Policy, one of
the most heralded and important conservation initiatives in a generation.
The proposal protects America's remaining wild forests by blocking future
road building projects, commercial logging, and other activities that
benefit timber and exploitation industries.
<p>
Would Senator Ashcroft, as the head of the Justice Department, defend the
new protections for American forests?
<p>
His record:
    Ashcroft has consistently opposed attempts to reform the U.S. Forest
Services' management practices in our national forests, even voting to
continue to allow taxpayer subsidization of money-losing logging on our 
public lands.
<p>
    On July 27, 1999, Senator Ashcroft voted against Sen. Patty Murray's
(D-WA) amendment to the Department of Interior Appropriations Bill for the
year 2000. Her amendment would have stopped an anti-environmental rider 
that allows mining operations to dump their toxic tailings and other waste
across unlimited areas of public lands. The Sierra Club supported Senator
Murray's amendment to block the rider because it would limit the size of
mining waste dumps on public lands, as required by current law.
<p>
    Of particular concern to Missourians was Ashcroft's attempt to
browbeat the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture 
into rubberstamping mining permits for the Doe Run Co. The mining company
was trying to get approval to conduct mining activities in the watersheds
of the Current, Jack's Fork and Eleven Point Rivers, and the Interior and
Agriculture departments were following legally required procedures in
processing the permits. Ashcroft wanted these processes short-circuited.
<p>
    Senator Ashcroft supported a proposal to study possible lead mining
near the Ozark National Scenic Riverways and to allow possible future lead
mining. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 3/31/98)
<p>
His campaign contributions:
Senator Ashcroft raised more than $150,000 from timber, mining and other
anti-wilderness groups.  This fundraising prowess rates him the fourth
worst in the category of Public Land Use Dirty Money. (Environmental
Working Group)
<p>
<b>Challenging Sprawl: Granting Special Rights to Special Interests</b>
<p>
Large developers are mounting legal challenges in their efforts to seek 
compensation from the federal government for so called "takings."  In
essence, these developers are seeking taxpayer subsidies to pay them not to
harm the environment.
<p>
Would the Justice Department under the direction of Senator Ashcroft work
to protect the interests of citizens, children, and workers or will he
defend large companies that demand these "takings" for complying with
health and other safeguards?
<p>
His record:
    Senator Ashcroft has been in favor of a measure that would let land
speculators and developers go directly to federal courts in the event that
a local planning and zoning ordinance was standing in their way. This flies
in the face of local control of land uses which Ashcroft often advocates,
but Ashcroft's friends and donors in the development community persuaded
him to support this measure to bypass local and state courts (S. 2271,
07/13/98).  Previously, he was one of only 34 Senators to cosponsor much
broader versions of this legislation.
<p>
His campaign contributions:
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Senator Ashcroft received
more than $135,000 from Real Estate groups across the country in the
1999-2000 election cycle.
(www.opensecrets.org/2000elect/dist_indus/MOS2.htmm).
<p>
<b>Weakening the Clean up of Toxic Waste in Waterways</b>
<p>
The EPA has ordered General Electric to clean up their PCB pollution in the
Hudson River.  As a Senator, Ashcroft voted to block EPA.  General Electric
is still fighting the ruling in the courts.
<p>
As Attorney General, would Ashcroft work to enforce the government ruling
to force cleanup of the Hudson?
<p>
His record:
Ashcroft opposed a Sense of the Senate resolution to counteract language in
the EPA's funding bill that weakens or precludes the EPA's ability to clean
up some of the thousands of miles of our nation's rivers, lakes and bays
that are contaminated with toxic chemicals. This includes the 200 miles of
the Hudson River in New York that General Electric contaminated with more
than 1,000,000 pounds of PCBs. On October 12, 2000, Ashcroft voted against
an amendment to give EPA full authority to cleanup the Hudson River.
<p>
His campaign contributions:
Ashcroft received $8,000 from the General Electric PAC, and an undetermined
amount from individual employees.  (www.fec.gov)
<p>
<b>Global Warming and Clean Energy</b>
<p>
The auto industry has spent millions of dollars fighting improved
automobile fuel-economy (CAFE) standards.  Increasing CAFE standards is the
single biggest step we can take to fight global warming.
<p>
Would Senator Ashcroft, as Attorney General, fight the auto industry to 
ensure they are meeting CAFE standards?  Would he make sure that
environmental standards were met at the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste
Repository?
<p>
    In the fall of 2000, Senator Ashcroft, along with Sen. Abraham (R-MI)
and Sen. Levin (D-MI), attempted for the second time in two years to
continue the ban on Department of Transportation studies of raising miles
per gallon standards for cars and trucks, even though this would help
consumers faced with soaring gasoline prices.  The Senators were
out-numbered and did not bring their anti-environmental amendment to the
Senate Floor.
<p>
    Senator Ashcroft voted in favor of anti-environmental riders including
provisions to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to undermine
the President's authority to protect spectacular American landscapes.
(Amdt. 2295 to S.C.R. 101, 4/6/00; Nickles' Amendment to Interior
Appropriations bill H.R. 4578, 7/18/00)
<p>
    Senator Ashcroft voted in favor of shipping 70,000 tons of nuclear
waste through Missouri.  The bill would speed up the timeline for long-term
storage of spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which could
interfere with setting the most protective radiation standard possible for
the storage facility. (S. 1287, 2/10/00)
<p>
His campaign contributions:
Senator Ashcroft raised more than $386,655 from auto companies, oil
companies, and other global warming action groups such as DaimlerChrysler
and the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.  This
fundraising prowess rates him the third worst in the category of Global 
Warming Dirty Money. (Environmental Working Group Dirty Money Tracker,
www.ewg.org)
<p>
<b>Voting Against Campaign Finance Reform</b>
<p>
Senator Ashcroft voted against cloture, which would have allowed passage of
Senator McCain and Feingold's Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1999 (S.
1593), a complete ban on soft money contributions to political parties. 
This ban would close a 25-year-old loophole that allows large companies,
unions and individuals to gain influence by donating huge unregulated sums
of money to political parties. These funds are then used for campaign
activities.
<p>
<b>Low Voting Scores
</b>
<p>
The League of Conservation Voters is a bipartisan organization that grades
members of Congress on the most important environmental votes of the year.
A 100% score reflects votes in favor of the environment on every important
environmental vote.
<p>
Senator Ashcroft's Career Average: 3.7%
106th Congress (1999-2000) : 0%
105th Congress (1997-1998) : 0%
104th Congress (1995-1996) : 11%
