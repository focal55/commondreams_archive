- May 7 - Commercial Alert gives "two thumbs down" to FOODFIGHT!, a movie-length
commercial for children, packed with branded products and characters, including
Twinkie the Kid, Wonderbread, Coke, Spam, M&amp;M's, Skittles, Mr. Pringle,
Tootsie Pops, Mrs. Butterworth and Duncan Hines. "FOODFIGHT! isn't a movie
- it's an ad," said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold Digital Research Labs (TDRL), which is producing FOODFIGHT!,
boasts that it "incorporates thousands of products and character icons
from the familiar packages of products in a grocery store."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If you want your kids to nag you and throw tantrums for products, this
is the movie for you," Ruskin said. "But we suspect most parents will think
twice before spending their hard-earned money to have their children bombarded
with two hours of ads."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"FOODFIGHT! is a sick and pathetic effort to take advantage of young
children for monetary gain," Ruskin said. "It raises the commercial assault
on children to a new level of brazenness. Some people will stoop to any
level to make a buck, and sadly, FOODFIGHT! is an example."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"FOODFIGHT! looks like a two-hour parade of junk food at a time when
we have skyrocketing levels of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes,"
Ruskin said.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commercial Alert and its international network of activists will undertake
a multifaceted effort against FOODFIGHT! While FOODFIGHT! is in production,
Commercial Alert will (1) urge parents not to take their children to see
it, (2) alert movie reviewers that this so-called "movie" is an advertisement
and should be regarded as such, (3) ask movie theater owners to play something
else instead, and (4) ask newspapers to list it under the category "advertisements"
and not "movies" or "films" or "cinema."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold promises that FOODFIGHT! will be part of a sophisticated marketing
effort at children. "This intellectual property marks the culmination of
all we've been working towards; a huge film, web site, animation, toys-all
financed and produced by TDRL and our worldwide partners," said Threshold
chairman and CEO, Larry Kasanoff.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If a movie-length ad is the culmination of Threshold's efforts, then
it shows just how low the movie industry has sunk," Ruskin said. "What
happened to the days when movies were art, not endless ads for Coke, Twinkies
and Spam?"
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold CEO Kasanoff is the producer of the Mortal Kombat franchise.
"FOODFIGHT! is produced by the same corporate predators who brought your
kids the gratuitous violence of Mortal Kombat," Ruskin said.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader founded Commercial Alert in
1998 to keep the commercial culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent
it from exploiting children and subverting the higher values of family,
community, environmental integrity and democracy.</font>

release.</font>
</b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International Consumer Packaged Goods Sign
on To Globally Produced Digitally Animated Feature Film, 'FOODFIGHT!';
Threshold Digital Research Labs Announces Participation Of Worldwide Brands,
Animators and Suppliers For Groundbreaking Supermarket Epic</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold Digital Research Labs (TDRL),
a subsidiary of intellectual property management and multimedia giant Threshold
Entertainment, today announced the exclusive participation of the world's
biggest consumer brands in "FOODFIGHT!," the most complex digitally animated
feature film ever attempted. The revolutionary project presents hundreds
of different sets and incorporates thousands of products and character
icons from the familiar packages of products in a grocery store. The project
brings together worldwide animators and suppliers and countless international
companies in a unique and unparalleled venture resulting in a groundbreaking
intellectual property of global scope and magnitude.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an unprecedented move for any feature
film, "FOODFIGHT!" has secured the exclusive rights to use products and
character icons in the film from virtually all of the biggest consumer
products companies in the world including:</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Proctor &amp; Gamble (Mr. Clean, Mr.
Pringle)</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
-- Tootsie Roll (Tootsie Roll Owl, Tootsie
Pops)</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Products and brands specific to various
countries will be alternated in order to customize the film for a worldwide
audience. Deals for toys, games, video games and merchandise are in the
works. "FOODFIGHT!" shows us what really happens in the supermarket at
night when the lights go out and all the people leave. Product icons come
alive in a "wild city" and head towards the hottest club in town, the Copabanana.
All's well until Brand X moves into town. The film follows the epic adventures
of hundreds of internationally branded characters from the familiar packages
of products including Mr. Clean, Twinkie the Kid, Charlie the Tuna, Mrs.
Butterworth and new characters like Dex Detective from Cinnamon Sleuth
Cereal and Daredevil Dan as they battle the evil Brand X for control of
the store.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold chairman and CEO, Larry Kasanoff
announced the production, adding, "This intellectual property marks the
culmination of all we've been working towards; a huge film, web site, animation,
toys-all financed and produced by TDRL and our worldwide partners. This
is the first movie made by a worldwide team, for a worldwide audience and
customized for each country."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold has raised equity financing for
the $50 million CG movie with an infusion of investment capital from Korean
animation company Natural Image. TDRL is heading up the 3D digital production
from its Los Angeles headquarters using its global network of animators.
Other animators from numerous countries are linked to this network. This
worldwide virtual studio enables TDRL to erase the vast distances that
once separated Hollywood from amazing talent around the globe and cuts
costs at the same time. The deal further positions TDRL as a premiere worldwide
animation studio.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another unprecedented move by any production
company or studio, Threshold has also started production of a 3D animated
prequel series, "FOODFIGHT!: THE ADVENTURES OF DEX DETECTIVE." The 22 webisodes
will run online approximately eight months prior to the film's release.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Lawrence Kasanoff/Threshold Digital
Research Labs production in association with Natural Image will be executive
produced by Joshua Wexler and George Johnsen, co-executive produced by
Daniel Suh and Gregory Cascante, produced Larry Kasanoff and Alison Savitch,
directed by Kasanoff and written by Brent V. Friedman and Rebecca Swanson
from a story by Kasanoff and Wexler. Jim George is the Animation Director
on the project.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Natural Image is backed by Korean companies
Filmtree, Hahnshin Corporation, Bixel Media and Colorbank. Peter Choi,
head of Koran public animation company Hahnshin, is President of Natural
Image. "This is the most complex digitally animated film ever undertaken,
with thousands of different characters and hundreds of sets. We've searched
the world for the best talent and have found extraordinary 3D animation
talent in a number of different countries," continued Kasanoff.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The production of "FOODFIGHT!" also comes
with the participation of top technology firms worldwide. The IBM Corporation's
Intellistation division is supplying Z Pro workstations for the creation
of groundbreaking animation. Done in full digital 3D, the animation will
be the next step in the marriage of computer and the animation arts. IBM
will also supply new generation scalable rendering hardware -- the key
technology that makes a feature film of this scope possible. Rendering
will be facilitated through a combination of IBM's high capacity Netfinity(R)
4000R server line and the Intellistation Z Pro and M Pro products. Over
200 workstations will be deployed for the project. TDRL will use its partnership
with Sprint to provide access to its remote artists on its worldwide network
using a suite of communications tools.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold Digital Research Labs (TDRL)
is a groundbreaking digital asset production studio that produces 100%
digital visual effects and animation for all forms of media including movies,
TV and websites. The company has created and produced digital visual effects
for movies such as "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer," "The Faculty,"
and "Dogma;" for TV commercials such as "Korbel Champagne;" and for TV
series like "Mortal Kombat: Conquest."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Threshold Entertainment is the leading
innovator in Intellectual Property Management specializing in Digital Media
and representing some of the best-known entertainment properties in the
world. The company develops brands for production and publication in film
and television and on the Internet, retaining ownership of the digital
assets.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Larry Kasanoff is chairman and CEO of Threshold
Entertainment and producer of the $5 billion Mortal Kombat franchise. Formerly
president and co-founder with James Cameron of Lightstorm Entertainment,
he supervised production of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and executive
produced "True Lies."</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alison Savitch, President of TDRL, is one
of the best visual effects supervisors in the motion picture industry.
Her credits include "Terminator 2," "Dracula," "The Shadow" and "The Last
Action Hero." Savitch is Associate Producer and Visual Effects Supervisor
for the movie "Mortal Kombat," and Executive Producer of Threshold's feature
films "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" and "Beowulf." Her skill at combining
technology with entertainment, as evidenced in Threshold's cutting edge
animated video "Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins," is virtually unparalleled.</font>
