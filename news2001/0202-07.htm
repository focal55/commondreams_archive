- February 2 - California's energy shortage has given rise to a slew of
myths and misperceptions about the causes of and solutions to the crunch.
In an effort to separate fact from fiction, the Sierra Club has prepared
this release. Sierra Club energy experts are also available to provide more
information.
<p>
To set up an interview or get more information, please contact Joanie
Clayburgh, Press Secretary at (415) 977-5508, or by email at
&lt;<a href="mailto:joanie.clayburgh@sierraclub.org">joanie.clayburgh@sierraclub.org</a>&gt;.
<p>
MYTH: Environmentalists caused California's power shortage.
<p>
FACT: As the Los Angeles Times said in an editorial (Jan. 31, 2001): "The
California electricity shortage was not cause by environmental
extremism..." And, as Paul Krugman of the New York Times said ("Smog and
Mirrors" Jan. 31, 2001), "Nor, apparently, did environmental regulations
play much of a role in California's failure to build new plants in the
years since deregulation."
<p>
The California electricity shortage is mainly the result of a flawed
deregulation plan compounded by mistakes made by the utilities.
<p>
+ The Sierra Club has not blocked or delayed any new power plants in
California over the last ten years.
<p>
+ The Sierra Club has long been in favor of updating old, inefficient
generating plants with cleaner, more efficient ones and we support the
proposed Calpine generating plant slated to be built near San Jose.
Unfortunately, this plant has been blocked by Cisco Systems, who is
planning to build an office park nearby.
<p>
+ In 1995, the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations supported
the construction of the 1400 megawatts of new, clean generating capacity.
According to an article in the Los Angeles Daily News ("By Killing Plan,
Socal Edison Helped Create Power Crisis," Jan. 21): "...Southern California
Edison and other utilities helped kill a state plan that would have
authorized the creation of new power plants sufficient to power 1.4 million
homes, records and interviews show." The utilities hoped that they could
buy " plenty of cheaper power elsewhere..."
<p>
+ To add insult to injury the same Daily New article reported: "By state
law, much of the power was ordered to come from renewable energy such as
wind, geothermal and solar."
<p>
+ According to the California Energy Commission, no electric power plant in
California has been rejected over air pollution issues.
<p>
MYTH: The Sierra Club is against building new power plants in California
<p>
FACT: The Sierra Club has long advocated for modernizing or replacing older
power plants with newer ones. New power plants are up to 50% more efficient
and up to 90% cleaner than older ones. Utilities and power producers on the
other hand, have resisted building new plants over the last ten years
because, until recently, demand did not force them to do so and because the
utilities knew that deregulation would force them to sell off plants.
<p>
+ In the last three years, a number of proposed power plants have been
slowed by objections from competing energy companies. According to the
Sacramento Bee (Jan. 28, 2001): "Of the 21 power plants proposed for
licensing since 1997, competing companies have intervened in 12 proposals,
slowing the process in at least four situations..."
<p>
MYTH: Higher energy prices and the California energy crunch show that we
need to increase our oil supply by drilling in the Arctic National Refuge.
<p>
FACT: California gets less than 1% of its electricity from oil-fired plants
and, as the Los Angeles Times states ("Arctic Oil a Sham Answer," Jan. 31,
2001): "Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, President Bush's
signature energy cause, would not generate one kilowatt or electricity for
California. It wouldn't even produce any oil for an estimated 10 years."
<p>
+ Instead of drilling in the Arctic, we could find a new source of oil by
raising automobile and light-truck fuel-economy standards. If we increased
fuel economy standards by just 6 percent each year, by the time oil from
the Arctic became available, we could be saving 1.1 billion barrels of oil
annually. That's more oil than we import from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar,
Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and estimates of oil in the Arctic, and
national offshore oil combined.
<p>
MYTH: Air-quality restrictions have caused blackouts across the state.
<p>
FACT: Air-quality restrictions are not a major factor in the blackouts. In
fact, dirty plants are highly inefficient and waste valuable fuel. The
blackouts are due to a lack of energy production and are mainly the result
of the flawed deregulation plan and mistakes made by the utilities.
<p>
+ According to an article in the LA Times ("Bush's Idea of Easing Smog
Rules Won't Help, Experts Say," Jan. 25, 2001) with the exception of a
small utility in Glendale, power plants around the state "are cranking out
as many megawatts as possible to ward off blackouts."
<p>
MYTH: The Sierra Club supported California's energy deregulation.
<p>
FACT: The Sierra Club did not support California's energy deregulation
because we thought it would not benefit consumers or the environment.
<p>
MYTH: Air pollution standards are unnecessary and too expensive.
<p>
FACT: Californians enjoy breathing cleaner air in part because we have
taken sensible steps to reduce pollution from power plants and these limits
have affected the price of electricity minimally.
<p>
+ According to an article in the LA Times ("Bush's Idea of Easing Smog
Rules Won't Help, Experts Say," Jan. 25, 2001) "Air quality rules in the
Los Angeles region have had a role in raising the cost of power... But
because only a fraction of the state's power is generated in the region,
the overall price impact is limited."
<p>
And these pollution standards have helped clean-up LA's air pollution: In
1981 Los Angeles had 180 days where smog reached unsafe levels; in 1999, LA
had only 42 unsafe days.
