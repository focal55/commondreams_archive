- April 26 - President Bush is out of step with Americans on the environment
and energy policy, according to a new poll.  The Sierra Club and the
Mellman Group today released a poll finding that after President Bush's first 100 days, most Americans do not trust President Bush to protect the
environment.
<p>
With an eye toward President Bush's mid-May release of his energy
proposals, the poll found that by a 2 to 1 margin Americans prefer to solve
our energy shortages by reducing demand rather than increasing supply.  In
addition, Americans strongly disapprove of President Bush's plans to drill
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and our national monuments.
<p>
"In his first one hundred days in office, President Bush rejected
safeguards that protect our families from arsenic in our drinking water and
broke his campaign pledge to curb global warming,"  said Carl Pope,
Executive Director of the Sierra Club.  "This poll shows that President<p>
Bush's anti-environmental actions are out of step with Americans' values.
Even people who voted for President Bush did not vote for more arsenic in
their water or more global warming pollution.  The mining, chemical and oil
industries that heavily funded his campaign got what they paid for, and as
a result, Americans do not trust President Bush to protect America's
environment for our families or for our future."
<p>
"President Bush's environmental policies are costing him public support,"
said Mark Mellman, President and CEO of the Mellman Group.  "The more these
issues are debated and the more the public learns, the greater the damage
to President Bush.  President Bush's job performance on the environment is
strikingly low, and Americans do not trust him to fight for them on
environmental issues."
<p>
To mark President Bush's first 100 days and to continue to track his
environmental actions, the Sierra Club will run national print
advertisements next week and will launch "W. watch," a website highlighting
President Bush's environmental record.  Sierra magazine will also feature
stories about President Bush's first 100 days.
<p>
President Bush has rejected a number of environmental safeguards and is losing credibility.  Overall, 58% of voters polled gave him a negative
rating for protecting the environment and only 27% gave him a positive
rating.  53% of those surveyed opposed President Bush's decision to change
the arsenic standards while only 32% agreed with it.  In addition, on
reducing carbon dioxide to curb global warming, half of those polled (50%)
believe President Bush reversed his position on emissions after intense lobbying from polluting industries.  Just 28% think he changed his position
because of legitimate policy concerns.
<p>
Americans disapprove of all elements of President Bush's anticipated energy
proposals.  48% of voters gave President Bush negative ratings for
developing an energy policy and 48% gave him negative ratings for
developing policies on oil drilling.  When voters were asked about a number
of President Bush's anticipated energy proposals, they opposed every one of
them.  For example, 57% opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge and 35% supported it.  President Bush is likely to suggest drilling
off the coast of the United States and under the Great Lakes and 55%
opposed this measure and 37% favored this drilling.  Voters overwhelmingly
opposed relaxing air pollution standards to extend the life of power
plants, with 69% opposing relaxing standards and only 23% favoring it.
<p>
According to Pope: "The Bush plan won't solve America's energy problem, and
the public knows it.  What Americans understand is what we're proposing --
energy efficiency, renewable power and clean technologies --is actually quicker, cleaner, cheaper, safer and more reliable solutions."
<p>
The print ads will run in USA Today and in southern suburban newspapers.
Please find the text of the ad below.   "W. watch" can be accessed at
<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/politics/bush/w_watch.asp">http://www.sierraclub.org/politics/bush/w_watch.asp</a>.

Americans Didn't Vote for This
PRESIDENT BUSH:
As chief steward of America's environment, your job is to protect our water
and air, wild lands and wildlife. Yet since taking office, you've undercut
efforts to protect us from arsenic in the water, broken your promise to reduce the carbon pollution in our air, endorsed oil drilling and mining in
our national monuments, and asked to be placed above the laws that protect
America's wildlife. You are advocating drilling for oil in the Arctic -at
the same time your proposed budget cuts funding for renewable energy and
energy efficiency.
Yes, to be fair, you allowed stricter requirements on lead and measures to
protect some wetlands from development to stand. But on balance, your
actions have been bad for our health and bad for our future.
As you consider the fate of our wild forests, and prepare your energy plan
for the nation, we ask you to remember that overwhelming majorities of the
American people want the federal government to do more, not less, to
protect the environment. Americans are convinced that we can have reliable,
safe supplies of energy and a healthy economy without ruining our remaining
wild places and weakening pollution standards.
That's why once again, we're asking you to get in step with the values of
American people, to rise above partisan politics, and to resist the
pressure from your campaign contributors from the oil, gas and mining
industries. Be a leader. Protect our health and America's beauty, for our
families, for our future.
