- March 12 - The man nominated to be the Bush administration&#146;s
regulatory gatekeeper is a prominent, industry-backed academic who is hostile to basic
health, safety and environmental standards.
<p>His appointment would give industry a back door to the White House and enable it to
step up its campaign to dismantle basic consumer protections under the pretense of
applying &quot;sound science,&quot; according to <a href="http://www.citizen.org/press/pr-grahamreport.pdf">an
investigative report released today</a> by Public Citizen. </p>

<p>The report details how the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which Graham runs, has
been funded by industry groups that fight enforcement of health, safety and environmental
safeguards. The report also outlines the regulatory rollback crusade Graham has embarked
on in recent years to dismantle these standards. Graham, whose work is heavily funded by
chemical companies and industrial interests, has been tapped to head the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the White House&#146;s Office of
Management and Budget (OMB). His appointment is subject to congressional confirmation.</p>

<p>The OMB is expected to play as critical a regulatory role in the Bush II administration
as it did during the Reagan and Bush I administrations. During the Reagan-Bush I years,
political appointees within OMB were given broad discretion to review and block new
standards created by federal agencies, often at the direct request of chemical companies,
polluters and manufacturers.</p>

<p>&quot;The president has nominated someone intent on eradicating basic government
safeguards to head the very office charged with overseeing them,&quot; Public Citizen
President Joan Claybrook said. &quot;The public may never have heard of John Graham, but
he could dramatically affect the quality of the air they breathe, the wholesomeness of the
food they eat and the safety of the cars they drive. This is an obscure but powerful
office.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Senate must see the danger in confirming Mr. Graham to this spot. Doing so
would have profound and troubling implications. Rather than being a fair-minded assessor,
Graham would continue to conspire with the chemical polluters, the tobacco industry,
automakers, the oil and gas industries and others to stop the issuance of safety
protections. The Senate must delve into the many conflicts he would bring to the job and
reject this nomination.&quot;</p>

<p>A primary function of OIRA is to review regulatory analyses and calculations produced
by federal agencies. It can use them to slow or stall new rules unfavorable to corporate
interests. Virtually all significant new rules must be reviewed by this office. These
include agency actions on industrial chemicals, fuel economy standards, air and water
pollution levels, and virtually every other issue that is critical to human and
environmental health.</p>

<p>Graham has devoted years to discrediting government regulators and shooting down safety
standards using pseudo-science, Public Citizen&#146;s report says.</p>

<p>Public Citizen&#146;s study has been endorsed by Center for Science in the Public
Interest, Health Care Without Harm, the Science and Environmental Health Network and the
Center for Health, Environment and Justice.<font FACE="Arial"> </font>Public Citizen has
sent letters to members of the Senate Government Affairs Committee who will be voting on
Graham&#146;s nomination. </p>

<p>Graham is a key player in a network of industry-funded hired guns who for years have
produced bogus studies to disparage the methods of government regulators, Public Citizen
found. Graham frequently is quoted in the media as a neutral expert without any mention of
the fact that his Center is heavily funded by the very same industries whose damaging
behavior is under discussion. His center has received grants from more than 100 major
corporations, according to information on its Web site.</p>

<p>Public Citizen found that:</p>

<p>Graham solicited money from tobacco giant Philip Morris in 1991 to help fund his
center, and five months later invited the company to review a chapter of his book on
second-hand smoke. Internal company memos show that Big Tobacco relied on Graham&#146;s
work to discredit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to undermine an upcoming
EPA assessment of the cancer-causing effects of second-hand smoke;</p>

<p>Graham&#146;s center published a study in July 2000 concluding that a ban on using cell
phones while driving is unwarranted, even though the federal government has recommended
that drivers pull over before using a cell phone. The $300,000 study was funded by
AT&amp;T Wireless Communications; and</p>

<p>Graham frequently advocates industry positions to journalists, yet he often wildly
distorts the facts. In 1997, he wrongly told the Associated Press that &quot;most&quot; of
the 38 children killed by air bags had been decapitated, when in fact, they had not. He
told ABC&#146;s Good Morning America that a Center study had found that passenger side air
bags cost $399,000 for each year of life saved. After harsh consumer criticism the study
was peer-reviewed. When it was later published, the cost had been revised to $61,000, and
the study concluded that air bags were a worthwhile investment, even though earlier he
told Good Morning America they were not.</p>

<p>&quot;A person with such disdain for public priorities should not be given a last-ditch
veto over the will of the public,&quot; Claybrook said. &quot;Installing an
industry-funded flack in such a crucial position would harm the public for
generations.&quot;
