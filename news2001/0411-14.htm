- April 11 -Following is a statement
by Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids:
<p>With great fanfare, Philip Morris has introduced its proposal to
give the Food and Drug Administration authority over tobacco.
Despite the rhetoric, Philip Morris' proposal would not lead to
meaningful change or promote the public health. It is a cynical
proposal designed to make it sound like Philip Morris favors strong
regulation, but in reality, it would not require any change in
current tobacco marketing practices or permit the FDA to require
tobacco companies to reduce the harm their products cause. In short,
it will lead to business as usual. We oppose this proposal because
it would mean that more than 400,000 Americans will continue to die
of tobacco-caused disease every year and more than 3,000 kids will
continue to become regular smokers every day.
<p>The public health community is united in support of real FDA
regulation of tobacco that would allow the FDA to prohibit tobacco
marketing that appeals to kids, prohibit deceptive health claims such
as "light", and require that tobacco companies remove known harmful
constituents when they have the know-how to do so. The Philip Morris
proposal would accomplish none of these modest goals.
<p>In fact, Philip Morris' primary goal is to gain the government's
stamp of approval for the so-called "reduced risk" products that it
plans to market with the goal of getting more people to start smoking
and discouraging current smokers from quitting. This is a recipe for
more addiction, disease and death, not less.
<p>Philip Morris' proposal is a major retreat from the form of FDA
regulation to which it agreed during tobacco settlement negotiations
with the state attorneys general in 1997. It is another in a long
line of tobacco industry efforts to head off meaningful legislative
action with empty public relations gestures aimed at preserving the
status quo and protecting the industry's bottom line.
<p>The Philip Morris proposal falls especially short in several
critical areas:
<p>Elimination or reduction of harmful ingredients: One of the most
important aspects of FDA tobacco regulation is the authority to
require changes in tobacco products in order to reduce the death and
disease they cause. While there is no such thing as a safe
cigarette, there are many ways in which the harm could be reduced.
But the Philip Morris proposal would not allow the FDA to require
meaningful changes in tobacco products even if the technology exists
to do so easily and instead establishes cigarettes currently on the
market as the gold standard against which all future products will
be
judged.
<p>The Philip Morris proposal would allow the FDA to prohibit the
addition or removal of an ingredient added during the manufacturing
process only if the ingredient would render the products even more
dangerous than current products; in effect, the FDA could act only
if
the ingredient would result in even more deaths. More important,
Philip Morris would not allow the FDA to require the removal of the
dozens of known cancer-causing constituents that naturally occur in
tobacco products or during the burning process even when they have
the technology to do so. For example, tobacco companies already have
the technology to reduce nitrosamines, one of the more deadly of the
more than 40 identified carcinogens in cigarettes, but the Philip
Morris proposal would not allow the FDA to require tobacco companies
to remove nitrosamines.
<p>Prohibiting marketing that impacts and appeals to kids: Philip
Morris' proposal would not give the FDA authority to restrict
advertising and marketing that appeals to children beyond what they
are already required to do by provisions of the 1998 state tobacco
settlement, which are limited and inadequate. A recent Federal Trade
Commission report showed that tobacco marketing expenditures
increased by the largest amount ever in the first year after the
settlement, reaching a record $8.24 billion a year -- $22 million a
day and nearly $1 million an hour. Much of this increase was in ways
effective at reaching kids, such as two-for-one discounts that reduce
cigarette prices and payments for high visibility store shelf
displays. Other studies have found increased tobacco advertising in
youth-oriented magazines and retail stores since the settlement.
<p>The FDA needs broad authority to restrict marketing that
influences kids, based on the evidence and not on the industry's
false promises that it does not market to kids. The Philip Morris
proposal falls woefully short.
<p>Regulating dangerous and misleading health claims: The tobacco
companies have repeatedly made claims of "reduced risk" that later
proved to be unfounded, deceptive and, in far too many cases, lethal.
One of the prime examples is the introduction in the 1960s of "light"
cigarettes that boasted lower levels of tar in cigarette smoke with
claims of less risk to smokers. In fact, the introduction of lights
did not improve the public health because it led many smokers not to
quit and smokers of lights tend to compensate by smoking more,
inhaling more deeply or blocking ventilation holes. Industry
documents show that the tobacco companies knew that federal standards
for measuring tar in cigarettes were inadequate and misleading, but
still used these standards to market "light" cigarettes with the
implication that smoking them was less hazardous.
<p>The Philip Morris proposal would prohibit the FDA from banning the
use of terms such as "light" and "ultra light." Philip Morris also
calls for the FDA to regulate so-called "reduced risk" products in
a
way that would amount to a government stamp of approval allowing the
tobacco companies to better market these products. The public health
community supports giving the FDA the authority to prohibit such
claims if needed to protect the public health.
<p>Philip Morris' proposal is honest on one count in stating that its
proposal "will be good for our tobacco business." But Philip Morris'
woefully inadequate version of FDA tobacco regulation would do
nothing to protect the public health and serve only to lock in the
deadly status quo.
