- February 6 - The following is a
statement by Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National
Abortion Federation:
<p>I am here today on behalf of the health care professionals
who provide safe, high quality abortion care to women. I am also
here on behalf of the women who choose abortion each year,
including those who have flooded our hotline with calls in recent
months, seeking information about mifepristone.
<p>I join my colleagues today in opposing this latest attempt by
anti-choice legislators to use politics to deny American women
access to a very safe method of early abortion.
<p>As many of you know, the Reagan and Bush administrations
prevented mifepristone from being available in the United States
because of their staunch opposition to a woman's right to choose.
Eight years ago, in 1993, President Clinton lifted the ban on
mifepristone and US clinical trials were finally conducted. For
those who have attempted to argue that mifepristone was
"fast-tracked" though the approval process, I'd like to emphasize
that its approval took almost 8 years.
<p>There is no doubt that mifepristone is a very safe method for
early abortion. In Europe, more than 620,000 women have now used
mifepristone safely to end a very early pregnancy. Close to 9,000
American women used the medication safely and effectively in
clinical trials. In fact, in the US clinical trials less than one
half of 1 percent of women required any serious medical
intervention. Since its availability in November, hundreds more
women have used mifepristone without any major complications. All
of the medical and scientific data clearly illustrate the
outstanding safety record of this medication. And yet, members of
Congress, most of whom have worked for years to take away a woman's
right to choose, are questioning mifepristone's safety.
<p>We should instead be questioning the motivation behind this
legislation. Restrictions similar to those contained in this bill
were considered by the FDA and rejected as medically unnecessary,
and inconsistent with the way medicine is practiced in this
country.
<p>For example, the FDA requires that a doctor offering
mifepristone be able to accurately date the pregnancy, be able to
diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, and be able to complete a surgical
abortion or arrange for back-up from another provider in the small
number of cases where a surgical abortion is necessary to complete
the procedure. The FDA specifically did not require that the
physician providing mifepristone be a surgical abortion provider,
because it is standard medical practice for a doctor to refer to
another physician if they do not provide a particular service.
<p>Claims that this legislation is motivated by a concern for
women's health are at best, disingenuous, and at worst, dishonest.
<p>In the last year, NAF has conducted accredited medical education
programs for more than 2,000 physicians, nurses, counselors and
other health care professionals in the safe administration of
mifepristone. Many of the clinicians who participated in our
training program are now offering mifepristone to women around the
country.
<p>We are proud of our role in ensuring the accessibility of this
medical breakthrough because mifepristone allows women to access
abortion care earlier than it has traditionally been available.
And earlier abortion is safer for women.
<p>We believe that the promise of mifepristone is that it will
eventually increase access to abortion services for women, as more
physicians add this option to their practices. It is this potential
of mifepristone to expand the pool of abortion providers that
threatens those who want to restrict its use. Let there be no
mistake -- this has nothing to do with women's health, and
everything to do with anti-choice politics.
<p>In September of last year, when mifepristone was approved by the
FDA for very early abortion, science finally triumphed over
politics. American women finally gained access to a method that
has been used by millions of women worldwide for more than a
decade. Members of Congress with questions about mifepristone need
look no further than to the FDA, to the vast body of medical
research documenting mifepristone's safety, and to the experiences
of the millions of women worldwide who have used this method safely
and effectively. There is no medical reason to impose further
restrictions. Members of Congress should leave the approval of new
medications to the FDA, and the practice of medicine to physicians.

of abortion providers in the US and Canada dedicated to ensuring
