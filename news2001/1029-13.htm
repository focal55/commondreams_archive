possibly as many as thirty-five, Afghan civilians died when U.S. bombs 
and gunfire hit their village, Chowkar-Karez, on the night of October 
22, Human Rights Watch said today.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of the witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch knew of Taliban 
or Al-Qaida positions in the area of the attack. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch reiterated its call to the U.S.-led alliance to 
ensure that it is taking adequate precautions to avoid civilian 
casualties, and called for an immediate investigation into the bombing 
raid that hit Chowkar-Karez, located some forty kilometers north of the 
Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If there were military targets in the area, we'd like to know what they 
were,&quot; said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;This is 
the second instance in less than a week in which we've documented 
substantial civilian casualties from U.S. bombing raids. The Pentagon 
has got to do more to avoid these deaths.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch researchers located six wounded survivors of the 
October 22 bombing raid that hit Chowkar-Karez. The six are currently 
recovering in Quetta hospitals. Human Rights Watch also interviewed 
several additional persons who witnessed the attack but were not hurt. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among those wounded by the bombing are forty-year-old Sardar Bibi, who 
lost her husband and six children in the attack; five-year-old Shabir 
Ahmed, who received severe shrapnel wounds to his head and remains 
unconscious; Shabir Ahmed's seven-year-old brother, who was also 
wounded; and three adult sisters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the highly consistent accounts of the survivors, the bombs 
came from several aircraft that flew over the village of Chowkar-Karez, 
which is located in the Buri-Kala area of Kandahar province, some forty 
kilometers north of the city of Kandahar. The attack began at about 11 
p.m. on the night of Monday, October 22, 2001. Many of the people in the 
village then ran out of their homes, afraid that the bombs would fall on 
the homes. All witnesses stated that aircraft then returned to the area 
and began firing from guns. Many of the civilians were killed from the 
firing. The bombing and firing lasted for about one hour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One family interviewed by Human Rights Watch provided the names of 
eighteen relatives killed in the incident, and another unrelated woman 
told Human Rights Watch that her husband and six children were killed, 
and that she had been told that as many as thirty-five people died in 
the raid. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of the witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch were adamant that 
there were no Taliban or Al-Qaida positions in the area of the attack, 
which is in a remote rural area of Afghanistan. In almost all other 
cases of civilian casualties caused by the U.S.-led bombing campaign 
investigated by Human Rights Watch, survivors and witnesses have been 
forthcoming in identifying Taliban or Al-Qaida military positions 
located nearby which could have been the target of the attack. It is 
impossible for Human Rights Watch to verify independently whether 
Taliban or Al-Qaida military targets existed in the area of 
Chowkar-Karez village, but the consistent statements of all witnesses 
and survivors that there were none is notable. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mushfeqa, aged twenty, was interviewed by Human Rights Watch in a Quetta 
hospital where she and two sisters were recovering from shrapnel wounds. 
She explained that she and her extended family had fled from the city of 
Kandahar to their rural homes in Chowkar-Karez when the U.S.-led bombing 
campaign began. Referring to October 22, she told Human Rights Watch, 
&quot;It was at about 11 p.m. First, one plane came and dropped a bomb. We 
ran out of the home, because we were afraid to die there. Then, some 
went back inside. I was at the door, and some of the small children were 
outside. Then the plane came and it was firing. I saw my mother and my 
brother shot. My uncle ran to his car to turn off the lights. Then a 
bomb hit the car and he died. ... When the next bomb came, I was inside 
the room. I was injured from the shrapnel.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Belqais, aged forty, a relative of Mushfeqa, confirmed to Human Rights 
Watch the deaths of her two brothers and many of their relatives. She 
named among the dead her eldest brother Noor Ahmed, aged fifty, his wife 
Masooma, aged thirty-five, and their four children, as well as her 
second brother, Saleh Ahmed, aged thirty-five, his wife Zarmina, and one 
of their sons. The two surviving sons of Saleh Ahmed, aged five and 
seven, are currently hospitalized in Quetta and were visited by Human 
Rights Watch. Belkais stated that other family members had also died. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shafiqa, a sister of Mushfeqa who was also wounded in the attack, told 
Human Rights Watch that in total nineteen members of the extended family 
had died and provided a list of names which included the names provided 
by Belqais and Mushfeqa as well as others. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another unrelated victim of the attack, located independently by Human 
Rights Watch, provided additional and confirming information of the 
incident. Sardar Bibi, aged about forty, is currently recovering in 
another hospital in Quetta. She told Human Rights Watch, &quot;I was wounded 
five days ago. It was at night, at about 11:30 or so, I don't know the 
exact time as we were sleeping. Suddenly the bombardment started. We 
went out of the house because we were afraid they would bombard the 
house. Then, we were running with our neighbors. Another bomb fell down. 
...The plane was circling and also shooting. First, a plane came and 
dropped a bomb, but the other plane kept circling.&quot; Her husband, Daulat 
Khan, and all of her six children were killed during the attack. Her 
children included two one-and-one-half-year-old twins, Mohammed Yasin 
and Mohammed Yusof, fourteen-year-old Akhter Bibi, fifteen-year-old 
Najia, sixteen-year-old Maimana, and eighteen-year-old Mariam. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She confirmed that there had been many civilian casualties in the 
village, and gave a similar death toll from one family as that given by 
the family interviewed by Human Rights Watch (see above): &quot;Many people 
died and many were wounded. Eighteen people died from our neighborhood, 
and seventeen others died who were relatives.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The incident in Chowkar-Karez village happened a day after twenty-three 
civilians, the majority of them children, were killed when U.S. bombs 
hit the remote Afghan village of Thori located near a Taliban military 
base in Oruzgan province (see Human Rights Watch release, &quot;Afghanistan: 
U.S. Bombs Kill Twenty-three Civilians,&quot; October 26, 2001 at 
<a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2001/10/afghan1026.htm" target="_new">http://www.hrw.org/press/2001/10/afghan1026.htm</a>). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge the Pentagon to investigate immediately what went wrong on 
October 22 and to take all feasible steps to avoid repetition of such a 
tragedy,&quot; said Jones.
