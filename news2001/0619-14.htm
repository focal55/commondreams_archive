- June 19 - Shocked by the backlash against the movement to speed AIDS 
treatment to developing nations, a powerful new coalition of U. S. 
religious groups, militant AIDS activists including ACT UP, African 
organizations, students, human rights groups and Jubilee anti-debt 
activists are joining forces in a mass demonstration and rally at 
11am on Saturday, June 23, 2001.  The march is timed to coincide with 
the start of the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS, and 
activists from around the world will be demonstrating in the streets.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands will gather at Washington Square Park, Manhattan and march 
to the Bryant Park rally, which will include speakers, music, 
banners, and chanting. Invited speakers include Linda 
Chavez-Thompson, Executive Vice President of AFL-CIO, Sonia Sanchez, 
noted American writer and AIDS activist, and Mercy Makhalemele, an 
AIDS activist from South Africa and international celebrity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noted AIDS activists from around the world will be available for 
interviews in Washington Square Park and also in Bryant Park in a 
backstage press area reporters can access by entering the park on 
40th Street.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent weeks, US Agency for International Development head Andrew 
Natsios, US Treasury officials, and other US officials have spoken 
out publicly against focusing on treating people with AIDS in 
developing nations. As early as April, an unnamed &quot;senior Treasury 
official&quot; claimed in the New York Times that &quot;Africans lacked a 
requisite 'concept of time,' implying that they would not benefit 
from drugs that must be administered on tight time schedules.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's like living through World War II and hearing US groups speak 
out against bombing the trains to Auschwitz,&quot; said ACT UP's Peter 
Roberts.  &quot;It's incredible to live in a time when health officials 
can speak publicly about letting 27 million people die when there is 
treatment that could save them. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kofi Annan, Harvard University, and others have asked the US to 
contributed 25% of  a proposed $10 billion to the new Global AIDS 
fund for prevention, treatment, and orphans response. Instead, the 
Bush administration has committed only 1/10th of that amount.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comments the Health GAP Coalition's Paul Davis, &quot;$200 million is 
about $3 for treatment for each person with AIDS in subSaharan 
Africa: enough to buy dinner, maybe-not enough to save a life.&quot; 
Following the US's dubious lead, several other countries have 
contributed much smaller amounts, jeopardizing the ability of the 
fund to make a meaningful impact against the epidemic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Says Paul Zeitz, Executive Director of the Global AIDS Alliance, &quot;The 
sponsoring groups aim to encourage the growing consensus that AIDS is 
a catastrophe that merits a massive infusion of cash for prevention, 
treatment, and orphan response. Although the Bush administration's 
response has been extremely disappointing, we are encouraged by new 
bipartisan initiatives in Congress to boost US funding into the 
billions of dollars.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Developing nations continue to endure crippling debt that reduces 
their ability to combat the epidemic African nations currently pay 
$13 billion per year in debt servicing costs. Even the 22 HIPC 
nations, among the poorest in the world, still pay $2 billion per 
year despite debt relief measures passed for them in the US last 
year. This is the same amount requested of the Bush administration 
for the Global Fund.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commented Jubilee USA's Tim Atwater: &quot;The $200 million which Bush has 
pledged for the Trust Fund is the same amount as subSaharan Africa 
spends on debt payments in less than a week. Congress writes the 
cheque on Monday. By Friday Africa's paid it back.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The march has been organized by ACT UP, Jubilee USA Network, African 
Services Committee, the Health GAP Coalition, the Global AIDS 
Alliance, American Jewish World Service, and Africa Action. The march 
is supported by the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) of South Africa 
and the National Association of People with AIDS in South Africa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without treatment, the 27 million people dying of AIDS in subSaharan 
Africa will quickly die.  Currently, more than one million people are 
dying every three months. Life expectancy in the region for people 
with AIDS is 6 to 8 years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTIVISTS DEMAND:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States Government and economically-advantaged Group of 
Seven (G7) Governments invest BILLIONS in grants to the Global AIDS 
Fund and to national AIDS plans and social infrastructure development 
projects in developing countries. Currently, the US has invested only 
one-tenth of the monies requested by the United Nations.<br>
<br>
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States Government and the Group of Seven (G7) 
Governments use their influence and voting power to call on the IMF 
and the World Bank to use their own resources to implement full 
cancellation of debts owed to them by all impoverished countries 
heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS.<br>
<br>
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wealthy countries invest in treatment access strategies and health 
care infrastructure, including vaccine distribution systems. These 
strategies include parallel importing, generic production, and a 
system of global bulk generic drug procurement.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JUNE 23 MARCH BACKGROUND:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's so politically incorrect to say, but we may have to sit by and 
just see these millions of [already infected] people die,&quot; [said an 
unnamed international health official], acknowledging that this was 
an option that would be considered unacceptable in the developed 
world. &quot;Very few public health professionals are willing to take on 
the wrath of AIDS activists by saying that. But a whole lot of them 
talk about this in private.&quot;

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUSH ADMINISTRATION: PURSUING TWO POLICIES ON AIDS TREATMENT</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secretary State Colin Powell and President Bush have orchestrated 
several recent photo opportunities and voiced interest in helping 
address the AIDS crisis. At international meetings, however, the 
United States is aggressively pursuing a different policy, supporting 
US drug company interests, that seeks to block developing nations 
from procuring AIDS drugs at low prices.
In recent meetings of the World Health Assembly (which advises the 
World Health Organization on policy issues),  the meeting of the 
UNAIDS PCB (the UNAIDS governing body) and the May preparatory 
meetings for UNGASS, the US government has sent large delegations (15 
people, compared to 2 or 3 for other nations) to fan out in sessions 
to intimidate developing nations. They repeatedly sought to strip 
official documents of language that supports bulk drug procurement, 
including participation by generic manufacturers. They have been 
largely successful, as the current language of the UNGASS declaration 
and the World Health Assembly resolution demonstrate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a related example from the spring WHA meeting, NGO representatives 
overheard Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson actually 
tell one representative from the International Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturer's Association: &quot;Don't worry, we're looking out for your 
interests. We know you're worried about the database, but we'll take 
care of it.&quot; (Brazil had asked the WHA to compile a list of drug 
prices and offer other technical support to developing nations 
seeking to procure AIDS drugs.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accredited UNGASS representatives from NGOs from around the world 
were also prevented from speaking to UNGASS delegates during the May 
preparatory meetings. In some cases, accredited NGO representatives 
were actually removed from meetings where treatment access was 
discussed.  The language they crafted, as well as other input, was 
ignored during crucial decisions about the language of the UN 
declaration (delegates were not informed that these documents, 
prepared using UNGASS rules, existed).
&quot;In the middle of this horrific public health catastrophe, the US 
government played a shameful role, protecting Big Pharma at the 
expense of the poorest and least powerful persons, millions of whom 
are going to die. Brazil was a real hero in this meeting,&quot; said James 
Love, director
of the Consumer Project on Technology</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IMMEDIATE NEED FOR TREATMENT: 4.8 MILLION PEOPLE
Of the 27 million people infected with H.I.V. in sub-Saharan Africa 
at the end of 2000, 4.8 million are in immediate need of treatment, 
the United Nations estimates. Of those 4.8 million, all but 30,000 
can expect to die without the drug cocktails that prolong life and 
reduce suffering associated with AIDS.
Activists are calling on wealthy countries to invest in treatment 
access strategies and health care infrastructure, including vaccine 
distribution systems. These strategies include parallel importing, 
generic production, and a system of global bulk generic drug 
procurement. Supported by data from Uganda and Brazil, international 
health experts report direct links between increasing drug access and 
strengthening infrastructure, establishing viable HIV prevention 
efforts, and solidifying provisions for care and support.
Activists condemn the United States and pharmaceutical industry's 
attempted prohibitions against using global fund resources bulk 
purchases and against affordable generic drugs. The march will also 
demand that rich countries make GNP commensurate contributions to the 
global fund, calling attention to the paltry donations made by the 
Bush Administration.</font></p>
