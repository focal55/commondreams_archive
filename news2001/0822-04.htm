<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 
- August 22 - The crisis with Pacifica Radio&#146;s flagship national news show, Democracy Now!, 
has gotten worse. Pacifica management has now suspended award-winning host 
Amy Goodman and the entire staff without pay. The Democracy Now! team found 
this out in the morning newspapers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last Tuesday, August 14, Amy Goodman and the Democracy Now! staff decided to 
move production from Pacifica station WBAI in New York to an alternate studio 
in downtown Manhattan because they feared for their physical safety (see memo 
from Democracy Now! below). At WBAI, interim station manager Utrice Leid and 
others had physically and verbally attacked them. When Pacifica senior mana
gement ignored their repeated written requests that something be done about 
the intolerable atmosphere of intimidation and threats at the station, they 
felt they had no choice but to fashion some interim solution and find a safe 
and secure workplace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But instead of taking steps to investigate the assault on Goodman, and to 
ensure a violence- and harassment-free workplace, it is Goodman and the 
Democracy Now! team that are now being disciplined by Pacifica Executive 
Director Bessie Wash. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more than a week, Pacifica management has refused to broadcast live 
editions of Democracy Now! that Goodman and her staff have been producing 
from Downtown Community Television (DCTV). This is despite the fact that 
other shows at WBAI are produced from alternate sites and fed to the station 
by ISDN line. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite Pacifica's claims that Goodman had failed to report to work, KPFA-FM 
94.1 in Berkeley continues to air the live broadcasts of DN!, as do several 
affiliates around the country who were able to get the feed via phone, web 
and ISDN. But on the other four Pacifica stations in New York (WBAI-FM 99.5), 
Washington (WPFW-FM 89.3), Houston (KPFT-FM 90.1) and Los Angeles (KPFK-FM 
90.7), listeners were denied the show they have grown accustomed to hearing 
each morning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For several days last week, Amy and DN! staffers Kris Abrams, Brad Simpson 
and Anthony Sloan engaged in marathon negotiations with their AFTRA union 
representative and Pacifica lawyers to defuse the crisis. Before they would 
return to WBAI, the DN! staff insisted minimally on firm written guarantees 
and actions by Pacifica to assure their safety. They also asked for an 
investigation of the Leid assault, an end to their banishment to a 
second-class production studio at WBAI, and unrestricted access with their 
own keys to the DN! offices. Clearly, if a station manager is allowed to 
physically assault an employee, as Leid did before eyewitnesses, and to deny 
basic quality working conditions, without any censure from management, it 
provides a greenlight for intimidation and attacks to continue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Saturday a producer on WBAI, Clayton Riley, launched into an on-air tirade 
of threats that were clearly directed at Amy and the current crisis. &quot;When 
you talk about the enemy, you find the enemy, you isolate the enemy and you 
destroy the enemy,&quot; said Riley. &quot;These people have put themselves in the 
position of being the enemies. This conflict is not going to end, in my 
judgment and let me be clear about that, until the dissidents, until the 
so-called exile community is destroyed. Unequivocally.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This echoes Station Manager Utrice Leid's own statements, some of which on 
NPR's Morning Edition of June 21st: &quot;I need you stalwart soldiers out there 
...This is a call to arms. I told you, it's a war.&quot; Leid said that some of 
those who she says were sabotaging the station are &quot;right here with us.&quot;

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plaintiffs in the various law suits against the Pacifica board have asked for 
an expedited hearing today in Alameda County Superior Court over this latest 
attack on Democracy Now! As part of a court stipulation between the two 
sides, Pacifica cannot unilaterally make changes in national programming, 
including Democracy Now!, and the litigants are seeking an injunction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A National Day of Solidarity is planned for this Tuesday, August 28.  Pickets 
will be held in front of Pacifica and affiliate stations in support of 
Democracy Now!</font></p>

MEMO FROM THE DEMOCRACY NOW! STAFF
=========================================
<br>
</b>
TO: Pacifica National Board and Pacifica management <br>
FROM: Democracy Now! Staff <br>
DATE: 8/20/01 <br>
RE: safety </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you know, the Democracy Now! staff spent last week negotiating with 
Pacifica management over how our safety could be guaranteed.  The talks came 
after two attacks, one physical and one verbal.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Friday, August 10, WBAI Station Manager Utrice Leid physically assaulted 
Amy Goodman.  On Monday, August 13, the Operations Director Sidney Smith and 
morning show host Marjorie Moore began yelling at Amy as soon as she entered 
the station. They followed her to her office, and when Democracy Now! 
producer Brad Simpson closed the door after her, Smith used his master key to 
re-enter. They continued to yell at us as we tried to prepare for the 
morning's program, until the on-air host came out of  master control to tell 
them to stop disturbing his broadcast. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We left after our broadcast, believing we could no longer safely work at 
WBAI.  We waited for a response to our Friday e-mails to management about the 
first attack.  When no response came, we wrote our second letter laying out 
why we felt we had no recourse, but to find an alternative space from which 
to broadcast and produce Democracy Now! It was only then that management 
responded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the next three days, the Democracy Now! staff negotiated in good faith, 
attempting to reach agreement with management on a minimum set of safety 
guarantees for our return.  We agreed not to comment publicly during the 
negotiations.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, the situation at WBAI deteriorated.  On Thursday morning before 
Democracy Now!, the newly installed morning show staff used the time to 
encourage listeners to attack Amy and Democracy Now! As further evidence of 
the increasingly unprofessional and hostile workplace, when people voiced 
their support, the hosts either mocked them or cut short their calls with the 
sound of a flushing toilet.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Saturday, the verbal harassment reached a peak, when producer Clayton 
Riley said on the air: &quot;When you talk about the enemy, you find the enemy, 
you isolate the enemy and you destroy the enemy.  These people have put 
themselves in the position of being the enemies. This conflict is not going 
to end, in my judgment and let me be clear about that, until the dissidents, 
until the so-called exile community is destroyed. Unequivocally.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This echoes Station Manager Utrice Leid's own oft-repeated comments, some of 
which aired around the nation on NPR's Morning Edition of June 21st:  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I need you stalwart soldiers out there. This is a call to arms. I told you, 
it's a war.&quot;  Leid said that some of those who she says were sabotaging the 
station are right here with us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These inflammatory comments are not just words. Several months ago, Clayton 
physically moved in on WBAI reporter Robert Knight for coming to Amy's 
defense, shouting repeatedly  &quot;Stop kissing the ass of that white bitch.&quot; 
Minutes later, he assaulted Knight in Utrice Leid's office, while she looked 
on.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Riley has also threatened to pay a hitman $400 to break the legs of Democracy 
Now! engineer Anthony Sloan.  He has screamed obscenities at former Democracy 
Now! producer Terry Allen.  In each case, informed WBAI and Pacifica 
management of these incidents.  Management never responded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, Clayton was not disciplined, but rewarded: Utrice Leid has since 
doubled the air-time of his weekly program. The hate-filled, violent on and 
off-air harassment and intimidation only intensified after Leid's assault on 
Amy.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Pacifica management has offered to post a statement asserting that WBAI 
is a nonviolent workplace, they refused to prohibit the on-air
personal attacks, which gives a green light for the kind of assault and 
harassment we experienced last week.  They also have refused to give Amy a 
key to the station or even to her own office.  She is locked out until she 
hands over her home and cell phone numbers to the very person who assaulted 
her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have an interim solution.  As we have communicated, we have a safe and 
even technically superior studio from which to broadcast. Democracy Now! will 
continue to work at Downtown Community Television until our safety at WBAI 
can be guaranteed in a meaningful way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will:
 - preclude further intimidation, harassment and assault
 - de-escalate the situation 
 - provide us with a technically superior studio at no cost 
 - lessen Pacifica's liability </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It also answers Leid's demand.  On the air, she has said we will throw the 
unwanted tenants out.  Off the air, she has stormed into our office, 
insisting that we find an alternative studio. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is ample precedent for this arrangement.  At least three men broadcast 
from offsite studios daily for Pacifica and WBAI:  Gary Null (M-F, 12-1 pm), 
Armand DeMille (M-F, 1 to 2 pm), and Pacifica Network
News correspondent Bob Hennelly (daily for PNN and weekly for WBAI).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For these men, broadcasting from an alternative site is a convenience.  For 
us, it has become a necessary safety precaution. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We feel it is our responsibility to continue to provide Democracy Now! to the 
Pacifica stations and affiliates, as we have for nearly six years. Because 
WBAI is presently an unsafe workplace, last week we
broadcast from DCTV.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The programs were technically perfect, of higher broadcast quality than even 
WBAI provides.  But most importantly, we are safe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until we feel our safety is guaranteed at WBAI, the incidents we described 
are adequately investigated and dealt with, and the on-air personal attacks 
stop, we see no other option but to continue to produce and
broadcast Democracy Now! in this manner.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our safety is non-negotiable.  We hope you agree. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signed,<br>
Amy Goodman, host of Democracy Now! <br>
Kris Abrams, producer of Democracy Now! <br>
Brad Simpson, producer of Democracy Now! <br>
Anthony Sloan, engineer of Democracy Now!<br>
