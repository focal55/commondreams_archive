- March 1 - "This nation faces a
fundamental choice," declared Robert Borosage, co-director of
the Campaign for America's Future (CAF), speaking on Wednesday,
Feb. 28, the morning after President George W. Bush outlined his
budget and tax plans to a joint session of Congress. Borosage
was opening a Conference on the Next Agenda, which brought
together progressive leaders and activists in Washington. He
said that for the participants, the choice is clear: "Will we
use the benefits of prosperity to invest in the future, or
squander it on tax breaks that largely benefit the few?"
<p>The agenda President Bush unveiled last night is "out of step
with the times and at odds with the emerging democratic majority
of the American people," said Borosage. "The majority of
Americans did not vote to spend much of the surplus on a tax
break that goes most to the wealthiest Americans. They do not
support privatizing Social Security. They want more investment
in education and affordable health care, while preserving Social
Security and Medicare. Progressives -- the activist base of the
Democratic Party -- will lead the fight for sensible priorities.
We will make the case for strengthening families, empowering
workers, and building democracy -- and challenge an
administration agenda that threatens to repeat the mistakes of
the past decades. Now is the time for progressives to lay out
a bold alternative and take their case to the American people."
<p>At the conference, Rep. Jan Schakowsky announced plans to
join with the Campaign for America's Future in taking this
argument across the country, enlisting national legislators,
state and local leaders and activists in a new progressive
leadership organization. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
outlined the growing popularity of the working families agenda,
and pledged to challenge the gulf between "rhetoric and reality"
of the Bush administration. Hillary Shelton, Washington
Representative of the NAACP, and Sweeney announced support for
building a new movement on voting rights across the country, to
insure that every vote counts and every vote is counted
<p>The conference highlighted three themes: (1) There is an
emerging majority for progressive reform, demonstrated by the 52
percent center-left vote won by Gore and Nader in the last
election. (2) That majority is built around an agenda based on
the concerns that families struggle with everyday -- from
educating their children, to affordable health care, to
retirement security. (3) The dynamics of the society and
economy suggest that demand for that agenda is likely to grow,
not decline. Now, speakers argued, progressives have to be much
bolder in confronting the Bush agenda and putting forth a clear
alternative.
<p>As Senator Paul Wellstone said, "It is not enough to argue
against Bush's tax breaks, we must lay out what we want and
argue our case to the American people." Wellstone warned
against spending too much energy in inside-the-beltway politics,
saying progressives had to link with the grassroots energy that
was building across the country. Wellstone and Schakowsky
called for progressives to build the infrastructure needed to
detail the agenda, enlist new leaders, recruit candidates, run
effective campaigns and build a progressive majority in the
country and in the Congress. As a resource for this effort, the
Campaign released The Next Agenda, a "handbook for
progressives," outlining elements of a progressive agenda.
<p>At the conference, Gore pollster Stan Greenberg detailed the
center-left majority that emerged in the last election. Not
only did Gore-Nader outpoll Bush by over three million votes, he
said, but Gore's central message and his stance on issues were
much more popular than he was. Large majorities favored Gore's
positions on Social Security, on how to use the surplus, on
prescription drugs and health care.
<p>Rep. Hilda Solis argued that with the changing electorate,
this emerging majority is likely to grow, not decline. America
is rapidly becoming more diverse, with Democrats benefiting as
the party of diversity. Women are working in large numbers,
with Democrats benefiting as the party for choice, pay equity,
and health care. Unions are showing an increasing capacity to
educate their members and turn out their vote.
<p>The fundamental dynamics of the economy will increase the
need and demand for more activist government, argued Jeff Faux,
president of the Economic Policy Institute. Women now work,
noted Heidi Hartmann, President of the Institute for Women's
Policy Research, creating new demands for child care, preschool,
after school programs, paid family leave, restrictions on
mandatory overtime and much more.
<p>Rep. Dennis Kucinich, head of the 52 member Progressive
Caucus, laid out the Caucus' alternative to the Bush tax plan,
a prosperity dividend that would stimulate the economy more and
cost less. He argued that as people learned about the reality
of the Bush plan, it would be defeated soundly. Rep. Jesse
Jackson Jr. called for progressives to lay out basic principles
-- that every Americans had the right to affordable, high
quality health care, and affordable high quality education --
and mobilize people around a message of hope.
<p>Afternoon sessions featured discussion of how to make
affordable health care available to all, with Senator Paul
Wellstone, Ted Marmor of Yale, and SEIU President Andy Stern.
Rep. George Miller, whom Bush dubbed "Grande Jorge" when they
met earlier this month, and NEA President Bob Chase laid out
elements of a real education agenda. Other sessions featured
presentations on the living wage campaign and pay equity for
women.
<p>In evening remarks, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney detailed
the elements of the working family agenda that represent the new
center in American politics. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois
warned that the coming struggle over direction and priorities
would not be an easy one. Bush had the bully pulpit;
Republicans control all branches of government. But, he argued,
if Democrats stand up for working people, and the make the case
for the investments vital to our future -- this is an argument
that can be won.
<p>CAF released a new book, THE NEXT AGENDA: Blueprint for a New
Progressive Movement, edited by Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey
and published by Westview Press.
