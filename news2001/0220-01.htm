- February 20 - Reports from the British media
have confirmed the extent of election engineering and
voter disenfranchisement in Florida in 2000, resulting
in the victory of George W. Bush in the presidential
campaign.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investigations by BBC&#146;s Newsnight and The Guardian
(reported on Saturday, February 17) exposed how errors
and manipulation by DatabaseTechnologies (DBT)
eliminated thousands of voters from the Florida rolls,
especially African Americans whose votes would have
gone to Al Gore.  The Guardian article is excerpted
below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party has insisted that errors and
manipulation aren&#146;t the only assaults on voting
rights, but that voting rules in some states --
regardless of miscounts, erroneous elimination of
votes, and other failures and corruption of the system
-- are designed to swing elections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens continue to demand that states like Florida
abolish disenfranchisement of convicted felons,
especially those who have served their sentences. 
These policies exist for the very purpose of blocking
the votes of African Americans, other people of color,
immigrants, and the poor, all of whom are
disproportionately incarcerated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats as well as Republicans are responsible for
enacting and maintaining these rules.  More people
were imprisoned under Bill Clinton than under the
Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations combined.  Al Gore
was conspicuously silent about voter
disenfranchisement in the wake of the Florida debacle.
 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bipartisan support for the War on Drugs ensures that
thousands of Americans get convicted every year on
felony charges for minor, nonviolent offenses and lose
their voting rights.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">De facto obstruction of voting rights has replaced the
de jure obstruction prevalent in many states before
the civil rights movement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party, like other third parties, faced and
fought engineered election policies throughout 2000,
especially prohibitive ballot access laws designed to
hinder third parties, and the barring of Green
candidate Ralph Nader from the national debates, which
are strictly controlled by a commission owned and run
by the Democratic and Republican Parties.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of Greens helped organize and joined the
Inauguration Day protests on January 21.  A lawsuit
undertaken by Mr. Nader against the Commission on
Presidential Debates is now pending in a Boston court.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&gt;From The Guardian:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Information supplied by... DatabaseTechnologies
(DBT), led to tens of thousands of Floridians being
removed from the electoral roll on the grounds that
they had felonies on their records.  However, a
Guardian investigation in December confirmed by
Newsnight found that the list was riddled with
mistakes that led to thousands of voters - a
disproportionate number of them black - being wrongly
disenfranchised....</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover the Florida state government, where Mr Bush's
brother Jeb is governor, did nothing to correct the
errors, and may have encouraged them.  Under DBT's
contract, seen by Newsnight, the company was obliged
to check its data by 'manual verification using
telephone calls and statistical sampling'. DBT was
paid $4.3m for its purge of the voters' roll, but
company officials confirmed that they did not call
voters they had included on their list to check if
they had identified the right person.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Lee, a vice-president of ChoicePoint, which
bought DBT last May, said: 'Florida law prevents names
from being removed from the voting roll unless the
information is confirmed by local officials - not us.'
 But he told Newsnight that the Florida state
government made it clear that it 'wanted there to be
more names than were actually verified as being a
convicted felon'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blacks make up about 15% of the overall Florida
population, but half the state's prison population, so
the errors tended to erase their names
disproportionately from the electoral roll. State
officials have denied it was their responsibility to
check the felons list, arguing that it was the duty of
the individual counties.  A few counties found it was
so full of mistakes that they dumped the list
altogether. Some sent out warning letters to the
people who had been stripped of their voting rights,
putting the burden on them to appeal. But most simply
accepted the flawed list, and removed thousands of
names from the rolls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The civil rights commission was due to question
ChoicePoint executives yesterday about their role. One
commissioner, Christopher Edley, said: 'There is a lot
of public concern that the contractor who was selected
to do this is a firm that seems to have ties to the
Republican party'....</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DBT was hired, in part, to comb through computerised
records around the country to identify former felons
registered to vote in Florida. After wrongly
identifying 8,000 Florida voters with Texas
misdemeanour records as felons, it supplied a revised
list of 57,770 'possible  felons' to Florida's
secretary of state, Katherine Harris.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list was full of mistakes mainly because of the
criteria DBT used. It compared its list of felons with
the Florida voting rolls by looking for a rough match
between the names and dates of birth. Thus, a
Christine Smith could have been disqualified if there
had been a Christopher Smith of the same age with a
felony record somewhere in the US. DBT also used race
as a matching criterion, skewing the impact of 
the errors even more against black voters, of whom
nine in ten 10 voted for Mr Gore&quot;....</font></p>
