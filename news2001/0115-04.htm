- January 15 - The following was released
today by Friends of the Earth:
<p>-- Testimony of Dr. Brent Blackwelder, president, Friends of the
Earth, Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination
of Senator John Ashcroft for United States Attorney General
<p>January 12, 2001
<p>Friends of the Earth is a global environmental advocacy
organization with offices in 54 countries. On their behalf, and on
behalf of our thousands of members throughout the United States, I
appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony on the nomination of
former Senator John Ashcroft as United States Attorney General.
Friends of the Earth strongly opposes confirmation of John Ashcroft
as United States Attorney General because of potential harm to both
the environment and the federal laws designed to protect it.
<p>The Attorney General, as head of the Department of Justice (DOJ)
and chief law enforcement officer of the federal government, has
sweeping discretionary authority to uphold and defend our nation's
environmental laws. DOJ's Environment and Natural Resources Division
(ENRD), in particular, has the responsibility to engage in litigation
concerning the protection, use and development of the nation's
natural resources and public lands, wildlife protection, cleanup of
hazardous waste sites, and defense of environmental challenges to
government programs and activities.
<p>The Energy and Natural Resources Division of the Department of
Justice currently harbors 691 authorized positions and operates on
an
annual budget of about $91.5 million -- 88 percent growth from 1989.
From 1994-1997, U.S Attorneys initiated investigations of an average
of 946 individuals and organizations suspected of an environmental
offense. Of those, an average of 462 was charged with criminal
violations. Coupled with a workload that includes an average of
211 civil violations and over 600 citizen suits filed, ENRD
is vested with the considerable task of serving as "the nation's
environmental lawyer, and the largest environmental law firm
in the country."
<p>As a senator for the state of Missouri, John Ashcroft had a
consistent record of promoting the interests of polluters over
citizens' rights and supporting attempts to weaken or roll back
federal environmental protections. To place the discretion of
enforcement and the responsibility of leading the nation's largest
environmental law firm squarely in the hands of someone with a long
record of opposing the laws he will be sworn to uphold would be a
grave mistake.
<p>John Ashcroft's anti-environmental record is clear. The following
are but a few examples from a career of flagrant opposition to
environmental protection:
<p>Derailing Environmental Protection Laws
<p>-- In the 106th Congress, Senator Ashcroft was one of only six
senators to cosponsor a bill that would have drastically weakened the
Clean Air Act by taking away one of the most critical enforcement
tools for states that fail to meet clean air requirements --
sanctions on federal highway aid (see: S. 495, To amend the Clean Air
Act to repeal the highway sanctions, 106th Congress, 1st Session).
Senator Ashcroft's hard stance on the Clean Air Act comes at a time
when industries are challenging current soot and smog standards in
the U.S. Supreme Court. With a growing number of regions that have
chronically dangerous smog levels, the importance of protecting the
Clean Air Act for public health and the environment is apparent.
<p>-- In the 105th Congress, Senator Ashcroft voted against a
filibuster of a bill that would have weakened land use protections
by
amending most federal environmental laws and allowing polluters to
newly challenge federal environmental protections. The bill also
would have overridden existing local procedures to allow developers
to challenge city and county zoning laws directly in federal courts
instead of existing local administrative appeals and state courts
(see: Roll Call Vote No. 197, July 13, 1998). So called "takings"
bills such as this would undermine local control over land uses in
the name of protecting the property rights of the few, and have been
opposed environmental groups, the federal and state judiciary, and
forty-one state attorneys general, among others.
<p>-- Also in the 104th Congress, Senator Ashcroft voted to build on
the infamous "salvaged timber rider" by extending indefinitely the
time for old growth timber sales directed by this provision. The
rider, attached to the 1995 Budget Rescissions Act, allows timber
companies to purchase and log parcels in our national forests without
regard to federal environmental laws (see: Roll Call Vote No. 33,
March 14, 1996). These riders have had the effect of ravaging old
growth and healthy trees under the guise of "salvaging" dead or
diseased timber while destroying wildlife habitat and degrading water
quality in streams and rivers.
<p>Protecting Polluters over People
<p>-- In 1995, Senator Ashcroft defended a sweeping bill (S. 343, the
Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995) that would have undercut
legal safeguards for environmental, human health, consumer and labor
protections (see: Roll Call Vote No. 315, July 20). This bill, and
other so-called "regulatory reform" bills like it, would create
avenues of legal maneuvering for businesses to eliminate, stall, or
revise safeguards. Such proposals that are clearly designed for the
sake of industries would also leave the public with no recourse
against abusers.
<p>-- During debate of that same bill, Senator Ashcroft voted to
defend a provision that would allow polluting industries to avoid
reporting most of their toxic chemical releases as required by the
1986 Community Right to Know Act (see: Roll Call Vote No. 306, July
13, 1995). The annual Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) listing, as it
is called, has enabled communities to track the operating
performances of local facilities and given these communities more
power to hold companies accountable and make informed decisions about
how toxic chemicals are to be managed.
<p>-- Recently, Senator Ashcroft voted to protect the mining industry
by attempting to block a rule that would require hardrock mining
companies to cover potential cleanup costs through bonds or insurance
deposits and hold mining companies accountable to strong
environmental performance standards (see: Roll Call Vote No. 224,
July 20, 2000). The rule, known as the "3809 rule" (43 CFR 3809),
was finally published this year after a long battle. It will serve
to protect the public by forcing one of the nation's largest toxic
polluters to act more responsibly.
<p>As this sampling of votes shows, former Senator John Ashcroft
consistently sought to undermine or gut the very laws that help to
protect fragile ecosystems and safeguard human health. If our
environment is to survive, we need someone who will actively and
effectively prosecute those that harm it. John Ashcroft's record
indicates that he would do otherwise.
<p>In summary, the position of Attorney General has substantial
discretion regarding how to address the diverse topics that the
United States Department of Justice defends and prosecutes. Based on
his record, Friends of the Earth sees no indication that John
Ashcroft will use this discretion for anything other than the
outright appeasement of polluting industries and weakening of our
nation's environmental protection laws. As such, Friends of the
Earth urges you to oppose his nomination.
