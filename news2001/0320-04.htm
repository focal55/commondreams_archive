- March 20 - Nearly 500 leading U.S.
and Canadian scientists called on President Bush today to stop
trying to change the law that prohibits oil extraction in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The letter urged President Bush to
"support permanent protection of the coastal plain's significant
wildlife and wilderness values."
<p>The scientists said oil development could seriously harm
caribou, polar bears, muskoxen and snow geese -- among other
wildlife. They warned it could disrupt the fragile ecosystem of the
coastal plain, which they said could lead to even more widespread
injury to wildlife and its habitat.
<p>"Nearly the entire Arctic Coast of Alaska north of the Brooks
Range is available for oil and gas and gas exploration or
development. The 110-mile-long coastal plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 1.5 million acres of key
wildlife habitat vital to the integrity of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. We urge you, Mr. President, to permanently protect
the biological diversity and wilderness character of the coastal
plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from future oil and
gas development," the letter concludes.
<p>The signers are experts in the fields of ecology, wildlife and
conservation biology, resource management and cultural
anthropology. They include George Schaller, world-renowned as the
greatest naturalist of the 20th century; Edward O. Wilson, winner
of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for his
landmark books on social biology; and David Klein, professor
emeritus at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, noted Arctic
scientist and winner of the prestigious Aldo Leopold Award for
lifetime distinguished service to the profession. More than 50 of
the signers are Alaskan scientists.
<p>The letter was organized by Defenders of Wildlife, the Alaska
state office of the National Audubon Society, and the Wildlife
Conservation Society.
<p>"This letter poses a stark choice for this administration. Will
they stop ignoring an overwhelming scientific consensus and large
majorities of the American people that support protection for the
Arctic Wildlife Refuge, or keep listening only to oil corporations
that want to exploit the last protected five percent of Alaska's
north coast?" said Robert Dewey, vice president for government
affairs of Defenders of Wildlife.
<p>Text of the letter to President Bush follows; list of signers is
available upon request.

March 20, 2001
<p>The Honorable George W. Bush
President of the United States
The White House
Washington, DC 20500
<p>Dear Mr. President:
<p>As scientists and natural resource managers from the United
States and Canada with many years of experience in ecology,
wildlife and conservation biology, resource management and cultural
anthropology, we encourage you to reconsider plans for exploring
and developing the potential oil and gas reserves of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain. Instead, we urge you to
support permanent protection of the coastal plain's significant
wildlife and wilderness values.
<p>The wildlands of the Arctic Refuge include the barrier islands
and estuaries of the Beaufort Sea, the Arctic coastal plain, the
Brooks Range, and the boreal forest within the upper Yukon River
watershed. First set aside by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as
the Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1960, this is the United
State's only conservation unit that encompasses an intact arctic
ecosystem. Combined with the adjacent Ivvavik and Vuntut national
parks in Canada, the Arctic Refuge represents one of the largest
protected landscapes in the world. Moreover, the Arctic Refuge's
coastal plain is a rare example of an ecosystem where ecological
and cultural processes continue to interact much as they have for
thousands of years. Unlike the adjoining refuge lands, that are
designated Wilderness, the coastal plain is not permanently
protected from development.
<p>When President Eisenhower established the Arctic National
Wildlife Range, he had the foresight and wisdom to include the
entire ecosystem both south and north of the Brooks Range,
encompassing the biologically rich coastal plain considered
essential to the integrity of this ecosystem. In 1980, Congress
enlarged the range to encompass additional wildlife habitat and
designated this unique area the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The refuge mission was broadened to include international research
and management, as well as support for subsistence uses that form
the basis of Native cultural values. Most of the original wildlife
range was designated as a Wilderness. Only the 1.5 million-acre
coastal plain was omitted. And today, this oversight remains a
significant concern.
<p>Five decades of biological study and scientific research have
confirmed that the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge forms a vital component of the biological diversity of the
refuge and merits the same kind of permanent safeguards and
precautionary management as the rest of this original conservation
unit. In contrast to the broad (greater than 150 mi.) coastal
plain to the west of the Arctic Refuge, the coastal plain within
the refuge is much narrower (15-40 mi.). This unique compression
of habitats concentrates the occurrence of a wide variety of
wildlife and fish species, including polar bears, grizzly bears,
wolves, wolverines, caribou, muskoxen, Dolly Varden, Arctic
grayling, snow geese, and more than 130 other species of migratory
birds. In fact, according to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service,
the
Arctic Refuge coastal plain contains the greatest wildlife
diversity of any protected area above the Arctic Circle.
<p>The coastal plain provides essential calving and post-calving
habitat for the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the largest (at about
130,000 animals) international migratory caribou herd in the world.
The United States and Canada share the immense responsibility of
managing this herd and protecting the key habitats on which the
herd depends. In 1987, the two nations signed an international
agreement to protect the Porcupine Caribou Herd. Since then, the
calving grounds on the Canadian side of the border have received
full protection, while the United States has not yet taken similar
steps to adequately protect this essential habitat within the
coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, where most calving occurs. The
Gwich'in Nation of Alaska and Canada depends upon the sustained
productivity of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, for their subsistence
economy and cultural identity, and are justifiably concerned about
its security. Extensive research on the Central Arctic Caribou Herd
at Prudhoe Bay indicates appreciable losses of preferred calving
and summer habitats in response to petroleum development. Although
the Central Arctic Herd has recently increased associated with mild
weather conditions, we cannot be certain that even current
state-of-the-art mitigation measures will guarantee access to
critical habitats for the much larger, more densely aggregated
Porcupine Herd. Displacement to new calving areas from developed
oil fields, as has occurred with a portion of the Central Arctic
Herd, does not appear to be an option for the Porcupine Herd
because of the lack of suitable adjacent terrain.
<p>Biologists also have identified conservation concerns with other
wildlife populations in the Arctic Refuge, including polar bears,
muskoxen, and snow geese. Although many polar bears den on the pack
ice, the refuge's coastal plain is the most important land denning
area for Beaufort Sea bears in Alaska. Muskoxen are year-round
residents of the coastal plain, and disturbance from industrial
development, particularly in winter, holds the potential to
increase energetic costs and result in decreased calf production.
Also, snow geese might be displaced from important feeding and
staging habitats prior to autumn migration, increasing energy
expenditure and reducing their ability to accumulate the fat needed
for migration. The coastal plain serves many biological functions,
including nesting habitat for shorebirds, waterfowl, songbirds,
raptors, and other migratory birds.
<p>The Interior Department has predicted that oil and gas
exploration and development would have a major effect on water
resources. Fresh water already is limited on the refuge's coastal
plain, and direct damage to wetlands will adversely affect fish,
waterfowl, and other migratory birds. These potentially disruptive
effects to fish and wildlife should not be viewed in isolation,
however. Arctic ecosystems are characterized by many complex
interactions, and changes to one component may have secondary but
significant effects on other parts of this fragile ecosystem.
Based on our collective experience and understanding of the
cumulative effects of oil and gas exploration and development on
Alaska's North Slope, we do not believe these impacts have been
adequately considered for the Arctic Refuge, and mitigation without
adequate data on this complex ecosystem is unlikely. Oil
exploration and development have substantially changed environments
where they have occurred in Alaska's central Arctic. Since the
discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife
Service estimated about 800 square miles of Arctic habitats have
been transformed into one of the world's largest industrial
complexes. Oil spills, contaminated waste, and other sources of
pollution have had measurable environmental impacts, in spite of
strict environmental regulations. Roads, pipelines, well pads,
processing facilities, and other support infrastructure have
incrementally altered the character of this ecosystem.
<p>Please understand that we are not philosophically opposed to oil
and gas development in Alaska. Indeed, we all clearly recognize
the need for balanced resource management. But we also recognize
the importance of maintaining the biological diversity and
ecosystem integrity of our nation's Arctic. Nearly the entire
Arctic Coast of Alaska north of the Brooks Range is available for
oil and gas exploration or development. The 110-mile-long coastal
plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 1.5
million acres of key wildlife habitat vital to the integrity of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We urge you, Mr. President, to
permanently protect the biological diversity and wilderness
character of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge from future oil and gas development.
<p>Thank you for considering our concerns and recommendations.
