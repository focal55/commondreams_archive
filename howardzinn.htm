        to Impeach Clinton</font><font size="4"><br>
        </font></b><font size="3"><b>by Howard Zinn</b></font></font>
<P><font face="Arial" size="3">BOSTON - We all seem to have lost our sense of
proportion.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Why are the political leaders of the United States</font>
<font size="3">and the major media talking of impeaching Bill</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">Clinton for lies about sex, surely not the most</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">important sins of his administration?</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">If Clinton is to be impeached, why do it for</font>
<font size="3">frivolous reasons? I can think of at least ten</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">reasons to impeach him, for acts far more serious</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">than his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky or his lies
to</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Kenneth Starr. I am speaking of matters of life</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">and death for large numbers of people.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">1. Clinton approved, very early in his first</font>
<font size="3">administration, an armed attack on the compound of a</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">religious sect in Waco, Texas, under circumstances</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">which clearly did not warrant losing patience</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">with negotiations and choosing a military solution.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">As a result of the attack, eighty-one people died,</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">including men, women, and children.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">2. Also in that first year in office, in June of</font>
<font size="3">1993, he sent bombers over Baghdad, claiming it was</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">in response to a planned assassination of former</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">President George Bush, visiting the Middle East.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">The "evidence came from the notoriously corrupt</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Kuwaiti police. The U.S. claimed to be aiming at</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">"Intelligence Headquarters", but the bombs fell</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">on a suburban neighborhood in Baghdad. At least</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">six people were killed, including a prominent</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Iraqi artist and her husband.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">3. While land mines strewn around the world</font>
<font size="3">continue to kill or cripple thousands of people each</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">year, and although fifteen retired generals endorsed</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">an immediate ban on all antipersonnel mines,</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">the Clinton Administration refused to go along with</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">a Canadian proposal for such a ban.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">4. In Somalia, in June of 1993, with the country</font>
<font size="3">in a civil war, and people desperate for food,</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">Clinton ordered a military operation to capture</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">a popular Somali leader, General Adid. The result</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">was the a thousand Somali casualties, soldiers and</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">civilians, and a number of American Rangers.</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">On June 15, according to the Associated Press,</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">a U.S. helicopter fired a missile into a residential</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">area of Mogadishu, wounding 12 Somalis. Ambassador</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">to Somalia Robert Oakley later said the military</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">operation was "an unfortunate policy decision".</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">5. The Clinton Administration continued the</font>
<font size="3">embargoes on Cuba and Iraq, causing widespread</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">misery in Cuba for lack of food and medicine,</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">and hundreds of thousands of deaths in Iraq</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">according to U.N. statistics. When Secretary of</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">State Madeleine Albright was asked if the goal of</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">putting pressure on Saddam Hussein was worth the</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">lives of large numbers of Iraqi children, she</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">responded: "we think it is worth it."</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">6. Claiming that he was introducing "welfare</font>
<font size="3">reform", President Clinton in the summer of 1996</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">signed a law to end the federal government's</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">guarantee, created under the New Deal, of financial</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">help to poor families with dependent children. The</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Los Angeles Times reported: "As ... families</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">battle a new five-year limit on cash</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">benefits...health experts anticipate a resurgence</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases...."</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">7. The Clinton Administration continued to spend</font>
<font size="3">$250 billion a year for the military, putting into</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">jeopardy the lives and health of large numbers of</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Americans. Clinton was willing to spend two</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">billion dollars each for the "stealth bomber"</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">(the total cost would be 42 billion dollars)</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">while putting perhaps a million people in</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">jeopardy by taking away their federal benefits.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">8. With millions of people either homeless or</font>
<font size="3">living under desperate conditions and needing</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">low-cost housing, the President in 1996 signed</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">the "Crime Bill", which allocated eight billion</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">dollars to build new prisons.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">9. Early in his first term Clinton signed</font>
<font size="3">legislation cutting funds for state resource</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">centers that supplied lawyers to indigent</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">prisoners. The result, according to Bob Herbert</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">writing in the New York Times was that a man</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">facing the death penalty in Georgia had to</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">appear at a habeas corpus proceeding without a lawyer.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">10. More recently, this summer of 1998, Clinton,</font>
<font size="3">wanting to react to the terrorist bombing of</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">American embassies in Africa, bombed Afghanistan</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">and the Sudan. He claimed that the Sudanese</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">target was a plant producing nerve gas, but could</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">not produce convincing evidence for this. Almost</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">immediately, it became clear that the plant,</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">contrary to the American claim, had been producing</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">half the medicines used in Uganda. People there</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">would die as a result of that bombing.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">I am not seriously proposing to impeach Clinton</font>
<font size="3">for these actions, because they are not different in</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">essence, from the policies of almost all American</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">presidents, especially since the second World</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">War when the United States became a military state.</font></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Both parties, Democratic and Republican</font>
<font size="3">have gone along with such policies. I simply wanted</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">to put the cries for impeachment into a wider</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">perspective, to restore a sense of proportion</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">to our indignation, and to throw light on matters far</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">more important than the president's sex life.</font></font></P>
