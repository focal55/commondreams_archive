<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- November 3 -- More than 70 people chose to mark the day after the &quot;election&quot; by saying that they were voting with their bodies, not just their ballots, to end the war. The group called for the money spent on warfare -- now approaching $200 billion in addition to the annual $440 billion annual military budget -- to be spent on schools, jobs, health care and other civilian needs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under a heavy police presence, the War Resisters League reclaimed Ground Zero, which the Bush administration has exploited as a justification for war, as a site of mourning and opposing war and bloodshed. Spokesperson Ed Hedemann also noted that after the &quot;preemptive arrests&quot; of WRL members on august 31 the group wanted to reclaim the space for free speech and freedom of assembly. From Ground Zero, the group marched to the New York Stock Exchange to call attention to the costs and consequences of war and to condemn those who are profiting from war and destruction. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seven members of the group were arrested in two separate attempts to blockade the New York Stock Exchange.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protesters carried home-made body bags in their procession to the Stock Exchange. <br>While hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in Iraq, Afghanistan and more than 1,100 U.S. soldiers have died, Lockheed Martin, the world's largest military contractor, just reported a surge in profit- up 41 % increase- for the third quarter. &quot;These companies, which trade on the stock exchange, have so much influence in our government that they are literally 'calling the shots' when it comes to our war-making policy,&quot; said WRL intern Deidre Hughes, who was arrested in the blockade. &quot;Sometimes it seems that they have conscripted our troops to effect a corporate takeover of an entire nation.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While billions of dollars are being made off the war by the companies represented in the New York Stock Exchange,&quot; says participant Tom Good, with the Socialist Party, &quot;we just have to look around New York City to see the costs of Bush's war policies- education funding cuts, more expensive subway services, cutbacks at hospitals and emergency rooms, closed fire stations.&quot;  In the meantime, both Bush and Kerry accepted large contributions from corporations on the NYSE.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The real story of the Bush/Kerry race is that neither candidate listened to the millions of Americans who say, &quot;Bring the Troops Home Now, End the War in Iraq and Afghanistan,&quot; said Ruth Benn, Coordinator, National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee, and a member of NYC WRL. &quot;We can't fight terrorism with the terror of missiles, bombs and occupation,&quot; she concluded.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As organizer Frida Berrigan said, &quot;In a time marked by war and killing, we know that building a world of peace and justice will take more than punching a card or pulling a lever. We are here to recommit ourselves to that work.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NYC WRL is part of the War Resisters League, an 81-year-old secular pacifist organization whose members believe that war is a crime against humanity and advocate Gandhian nonviolence as the method for creating a democratic society free of war, racism, sexism, and human exploitation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On August 31st, a day of direct action during the Republican National Convention in NYC more than 200 WRL identified activists and well as legal observers, journalists and bystanders near Ground Zero were illegally arrested. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To see photos of the march and civil disobedience, visit http://www.actiontendency.net/action/index.html </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on the War Resisters League, visit http://www.warresisters.org/</font> <br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
