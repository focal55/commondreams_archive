Thank you for your forum, may you publish it in printable form to be
used as handouts to get people active in the polictical process.
What we activists have to think about is how to make the USA people
understand what is &quot;social justice&quot; and &quot;how we are dependent on the
environment&quot; and what is being done to prevent these concepts from being
shown to the &quot;elite (all in the US of A with respect to the 3rd world)&quot;
and how for those of the 'Christian right', that they are not acting a&quot;Christ-like manner&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As usual, the Democrats have sold out the very people who need and depend on them the most.  Quiet and stability are considered higher values than
Democracy and Freedom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's what this post election fight was about.  Whether or people not
people have the right to come out and vote without facing intimidation and
a system rigged to keep them from voting.  And then whether or not those
people have the right to have their votes counted as equal.  It seems
without doubt that voters in minority or poor neighborhoods faced far
greater barriers to voting than voters in white and wealthier
neighborhoods.  And it seems without doubt that voters in white and
wealthier neighborhoods had their votes counted at a much higher rate than
those from minority and poor neighborhoods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus the question in the days after this election was less about who had
won the close vote.  It was more about who had the right to vote and have
their votes counted.  And as usual, even though the voters who were denied
equal protection under the laws and regulation of the system were
predominately Democratic voters, the Democratic Party leadership failed to
raise the fight to make sure these voters had the right to vote and the
right to have their votes counted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the lack of equal protection under the Florida voting system, it was
an irony worthy of a Greek tragedy that the Supreme Court sited concerns
over equal protection as the reason for the delaying and canceling the
recounting of votes in Florida.  Particularly since the Democratic Party
had failed to raise the equal protection issues of Democratic voters as an
issue in their challenges and protests to the election result.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Democratic Party viewed the question of who won or who lost as their
primary concern.  Questions about fairness or democracy were germane only
to the extent they aided their quest for that narrow goal.  So its no
surprise at all that Al Gore now calls for unity, stability and patriotism
now that he has failed in his quest for that narrow goal.  In doing so he
once again abandons the fight for fairness and democracy for the American
citizens who were intimidated, discriminated against and had their votes
stolen.  Al Gore's promise that he'll &quot;Fight for You!&quot; lasted only as long
as it was useful to his quest for victory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately this has become standard procedure for the Democratic Party.</font></p>

 <br>
If anything, this election has been a mirror that reveals the degree to which the system and its players are ill equipped to deal with the living forces and energies of an evolving democracy.   That same mirror reveals to us the degree of work each of us needs to do to build democracy.  <br>
 <br>
Some 25 years ago, while a UCLA undergraduate I found myself reading the words of the poet-sage Jalal-Ud-Dim Rumi. His words of life philosophy appeared on the opening page of Justice William O. Douglas' autobiography Go East, Young Man.  In Rumi's words... &quot;All of your anxiety is because of your desire for harmony.  Seek disharmony; then you will gain peace.&quot;  I had just come upon the book by chance while seated at the university's research library. I loved the quote every bit as much as I did the humane spirit of Douglas.  I reacted to the quote by laughing out loud.  My laugh was so loud that heads turned as it shattered the silence that dominated the library halls.  It's 25 years later.  I'm not laughing!<br>
 <br>
No doubt, the current majority members of the &quot;anxious&quot; United States Supreme Court didn't get the point that living democracy's earned rite of passage is often disharmonious.  We live in a strange time.  This election has truly shown us to ourselves.  We claim democracy, yet we shun the dissent that democracy requires for the evolution of justice.  We promise democracy, yet we hear high priests within our &quot;legal and political culture&quot; make claims that counting votes is &quot;irreparably damaging&quot; to the efforts of some of those who seek election based on votes.  Wow!  <br>
 <br>
I always thought it was dictatorships that shook in their boots when they had to face the consequences of open processes, truth, and democratized vote counting.  I still suspect this is so!<br>
 <br>
We had better shake ourselves of this &quot;anxiety&quot; over democracy's often messy processes.  Results without regards to the means is what has always fueled unquestioning dictatorships in the ugly chapters of the human story.<br>
 <br>
 Don't fear democracy!  Be aware of those who fear democracy!  <br>
 <br>
In community...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm an active progressive Democrat who supported Al Gore - albeit with little enthusiasm. While I have always been - and remain - a big fan of Ralph Nader, I just don't happen to believe that a third party ala the 'Greens' is the best strategy. And for all it's many faults, the Democratic party at the grassroots level is still mostly made up with good progressive folk. I think those who have made the decision to go the Green Party route need to build alliances with progressive Democrats to challenge the rightwing shift in our country - and in the Democratic Party. We are like-minded and equally committed to fighting for social justice. Turning us into 'the enemy' is a losing tactic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">after watching gore give lieberman's concession speech (the name of deity
was invoked six times), i'm left to wonder:  was gore trying to become
president or pharoah?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;not under man but under god and law&quot;, gore said was &quot;the ruling principle
of american freedom, the source of our democratic liberties&quot;  that's funny,
i thought it was &quot;we the people&quot;.  goes to show how much i know.
now that gore has acknowledged that this has been &quot;one of god's unforeseen
paths&quot;, i guess that people will stop scapegoating Nader.
besides, it should by now be obvious that this is all god's will and we
should just let god's chosen representative here on earth, president-elect
george w. bush, get on with god's glorious work of taking all of the
homeless, poor, minority, female, and even merely lower middle class
citizens of this nation and bending them over a barrel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In northern California, for people who are interested in protecting our 
natural environment on public and private lands a Bush presidency is a very 
scary thought.  The great amount of progress made to protect our national

administration.  My hope is that more people get fired up enough to start 
actively participating in the environmental and anti-capitalist movement, 
trying to help protect our common heritage.</font></p>
