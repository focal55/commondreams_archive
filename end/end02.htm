<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This final turn of events could not be more advantageous for those who
voted for Nader and against the two-party oligarchy. Gore's failings as a
person and as a candidate have shone so brightly, none could fail to
distinguish exactly whose fault his loss ultimately was- his own. Better
than that, however, is this latest debacle. Bush's puppetmasters blatantly
usurped the election! Here we have the worst of the worst, who can do
nothing more than reveal how corrupt the system is, and his very&quot;election&quot; does exactly that. Brilliant. But best of all, that tired old
chesnut that Gore-supporters kept trotting out- &quot;What about the Supreme
Court?&quot;- has been proven totally and utterly moot. As today's decision has
shown, it's already _too late_ for the Supreme Court, and the Democrats
(Al Gore and the DNC) are to blame! I don't mean to crow about this
worst of all possible worlds - it is, after all, an abysmal state of
affairs - but could there be a more clarion call to the citizens of
America?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wake up, people! The vise is closing rapidly! This election was stolen,
the candidates were corrupt daddy's boys, the political apparatus is
fraudulent and hidebound, HOW MUCH WORSE CAN IT GET??? It can only get
better, but we better move fast.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The moment has never been riper for election reform. If we get our act
together and focus on this issue, the Green Party can make a name for
itself as the defenders of democracy and the only true party of the
people.</font></p>

partisan abuses of power have completely de-mythologized every corrupt
institution that makes up the myth that is our modern &quot;democracy&quot;.  The
executive and legislative branches are bought and paid for and the judicial
branch is just a tool for partisan expediency.  Even the most naive of us
can have no doubt of the illegitimacy of the government.  Only through
finally breaking through our centuries of living in denial as citizens can
we begin to take back the power over our own lives that we have sold so
cheaply through our greed and sloth.  This is war, make no mistake, and it
will take much sacrifice to win back our human rights, but now we can see
clearly that 'The Empire has no clothes!!!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am a proud Nader voter. And while I despise George W. and
everything he stands for, I believe his narrow and
illegitimate election may be the best outcome--given the
options--in the long run. Bush will be a weak and
ineffective executive--not only because he lost the popular
vote, and squeaked by in Florida  through the efforts of the
Republican partisans on the supreme court. But he will also
be forced to deal with an evenly divided Senate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other side of the coin, so long as Al Gore is not
resurrected in 2004, the Dems can thank their lucky stars
that they narrowly averted a Gore administration. We have
suffered through eight years of Clinton/Gore's conservative
take-over of the party. Think of the damage done during
those eight years--NAFTA, the destruction of the welfare
system, the Crime Bill, the Immigration Bill, a  broadening
of the &quot;drug war&quot; and soaring incarceration rates, to name a
few items.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But this conservative coup can be written off as a blip. I
believe that Clinton was elected twice largely due to his
skills as a communicator--much as Reagan was. Clinton was,
if nothing else, a very good politician.  Had Gore been
elected, however, many would have come away with the message
that the only way for the Democrats to win the White House
is to swing to the right--if you can't beat 'em join 'em.&quot;Triangulation worked for Clinton and it worked for Gore,&quot;
they'd say.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And what's more, Gore would be the presumptive nominee in
2004, thus guaranteeing eight years of conservative rule.
That, I believe, would spell the end of the Democratic party
as a progressive force.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, the Democrats are faced with a stark choice. Will the
party turn again to the conservatives in the DLC or will the
progressive forces within the party win this internecine
war? Only time will tell. But at least there is now some
reason for hope.  The 2004 election begins today. Who will
it be?</font></p>

 must be investigated. The voting &quot;irregularities&quot; in Florida must be
 investigated. GW Bush is the opposite of democracy. Antonin is an
 acronym for annoint. Bush was not elected, he was annointed and the
 mainstream press gave this marginal man a pass. He cannot speak or  
reason intelligently or humanly. He needs cue cards and teleprompters. 
He is a vessel for the rabid religious right wing who believes that God 
is on their side. The hypocrite Bush had Jesus as a backdrop when he   
announced his candidacy. He has never answered seriously the question, &quot;What would Christ think of capital punishment?&quot; He said something   
like, &quot;I'm a lowly sinner. I can't put words in Christ's mouth.&quot;</font></p>

 Democrats and independents must resist. With each &quot;success&quot; the right
 gets more and more bold. Don't think that this difficult month will
 chasten them. Quite the contrary - the fierce right - Delay, Lott,
 Falwell, Robertson, Reed, Helms - will extract their pound of flesh   
from the great &quot;unifier&quot;. The five Supreme court justices will also   
want to be paid for their treason. Will we remember this when Scalia is
 presented as chief justice? I wish Al Gore would fight. He does  
everything right and fair and honorable. He really is the president for 
the this millenium. I wish he would make the accusations that need to  
be made. It's not being unpleasant or divisive - it's being truthful   
and patriotic to call it as he sees it. Jeb Bush's state was rigged.   
The machinery is racist. Anyone elected as a result of that machinery  
should not be recognized by patriotic citizens of America. This    
election was not American. This was an election based on all the things 
the founders of the country aimed to fight. Gore is the winner. Bush is 
the loser. If Bush is the president, the country will be held hostage  
for four years. Our hands may be tied but our blindfolds are off - nor 
are we gagged - we can see and we can speak out. Avoid the mainstream  
media - search for the truth - resist the junk food that the right will 
try to feed us through the accomplices of injustice who have the   
cameras and the microphones. Watch them closely - speak out at every   
turn and our hands will be freed soon to cast ballots. By then, maybe  
ballots will be safe - until then our country is not.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Completely farcical.  I never doubted for a second that Bush would steal
this presidency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
But there is a positive aspect to Gore's loss.  Had he won, a majority of
people, particularly those who expose themselves indiscriminately to
mainstream media, might have thought of him as deserving victory, when in
fact Gore is the bigger phony of the two.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Bush has not hidden his agenda from anyone.  
Anyone who cares could see that.  Unless you are you are racist, classist,
or have a fanatical devotion to fundamentalist Christianity, Bush was simply
not an option.  Gore is the creep who partook in the backstabbing of true&quot;democrats&quot; of this nation.  He is the one who attempted to bully true
progressives into supporting his corporate-supported, environmentally
ambiguous, anti-poor campaign.  I am grateful he lost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So let's not give Junior any of the respect his chair has commanded in the
past.  He has not earned it.  Let's go full force against his policies.
Let's raise hell and make his one term even more ineffectual than what
Clinton did for the liberals.  We all know neither of the contenders should
have contended in the first place.  Bush is not a champion and Gore deserves no sympathy.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another positive aspect is the exposure our rigged ruling system received.
It reminds me of the scene where Dorothy discovers the true nature of the
Wizard of Oz.  Although this should not be taken lightly.  We need to run
Bush out of town like Frankenstein. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having worked on the issue of Iraq sanctions and having spoken with Al Gore, I was quietly rooting for Bush, and had hoped the Nader would tank Gores chances of getting into office.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The way the election turned out, Bush
squeaking in with next to no legitimacy, surpassed my wildest hopes.  I only
hope that one lesson the Democrats walk away knowing the Gore lost the
election because of the WTO, NAFTA, PNTR for China, sanctions on Iraq, selling out on the Kyoto Agreement, privatizing the Public Sector, wasteful
defence spending, Hawkish support for Isreal and nonsupport for the
Palestinians, and in general losing touch with the progressive ideals that
make the Democratic Party a viable alternative to the Republicans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  I think
the legacy of this election as it plays out, will be that---not only will
you see the Democrats swing back to the progressive left---but you will see
independents actually voting for them instead of the Republicans.  Its all
about selling big ideas of your own rather then glomming on to the populism
of your opponent.  We'll see in two years if the Democratic Party can get it
together, is willing to actually work to earn its place, and retake the
House and Senate.  As for the Presidency, this country has sat through 12
years of Bush-Reagonomics and trickle down democracy, followed by 8 years of
Clinton's triangulating psuedoDemocratic rule.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In George W., we will see
the right finally play itself out, and rather then being right of center,
independents will stop giving the Republicans the ball, and we'll see this
country shift back left toward the people and away from the moneyed
interests of corperate America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am one of the 1% of Mississippians who voted for Ralph Nader.  I am
also an ardent democrat (but not Democrat) who, on one hand, smiles
knowingly at the corruption and disdain for the people displayed by
Republican operatives at all levels of our government, but who, on the
other hand, has been extremely dismayed at the similar attitudes
expressed by certain Democrats towards their &quot;core&quot; constituencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I second Michele Chambers words below.  What is needed now is for
non-elitist progressives to gather 'round the campfire to plan how we
are going to directly oppose the present power structure of money,
greed, materialism, and authoritarianism.  I foresee coalitions of
environmental, worker's, and civil rights groups around the country
reaching out to one another and calling politicians to the carpet
(whether Republican or Democrat).  Democracy must be (and can be)
rebuilt out of the ashes of this aristocratic fete we have had to endure
over the past few months.  I plan to start by joining a local &quot;Death of
Democracy&quot; march on the eve of the inauguration.  Once we acknowledge
that death, we can seek its rebirth.</font></p>
