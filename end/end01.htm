<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First of all my profound appreciation to Common Dreams for providing
this forum as well as having consistently brought principle and clarity
to the presidential election debate from the beginning of the party
primaries to this decisive day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
What has encouraged me greatly, and is reason for optimism in the
upcoming weeks, is that the real constituencies supporting the Gore
campaign - often in spite of Gore himself - namely labor and the
African-American community, have demonstrated a level of commitment andcombativeness during the past five weeks that surpased that of the
election season proper. This is no doubt attributable to their having a
nobler, more
meaningful cause than the mere election of a lesser evil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
When the real struggle commences, which means this moment, added to
these two key forces  must be the equally vital peace and solidarity
movements, both of whom had little enough reason to support Gore but
both of whom should be gearing up for a preemptive fight to defeat the
machinations of Mssrs Bush, Cheney, Rice and company. The peace/disarmament/solidarity component, always in the forefront of
sacrifice, daring and creativity, will also help bridge the gaps between
the all too frequently isolated American progressive movement and the
rest of the world's advanced democratic forces.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
And don't write off honest if politically hidebound people who may have
voted Republican because of lack of imagination and information, and
because of outdated habits. Many of them can be won away from the GOP and toward independent, popular politics, especially if the campaign to
do so begins immediately.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an African-American, I'm having a really hard time
understanding why my peers are upset at the prospect
of a Bush presidency.  Don't get me wrong, I think
minorities and the poor will be on the short end of
the stick when it comes to the policies that will be
enacted within the next few years; but frankly I don't
think that this segment of the population would have
fared any better under a Gore administration.  After
all it was Gore who was the main supporter in the
Clinton administration for welfare &quot;reform,&quot; the War
on Drugs (which ironically disenfranchised thousands
of his potential voters), and the death penalty...all
policies that have had devastating effects on
minorities and the poor.  And seeing how Gore and his
minions wouldn't even touch the issue of black Florida
voters being turned away during this entire debacle is
just further proof that the Democratic Party takes its
minority constituency for granted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I voted for Ralph Nader and the Green Party on
November 7, and the longer that this mess has dragged
out I am beyond convinced I made the right choice. 
This is no longer a government by and for the people
(if it ever was), but a government by and for Fortune
500 CEOs and lawyers.  That Election 2000 ended the
way it did is of no surprise to me and is emblematic
of how democracy only exists in this country if you
have deep pockets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I just hope that my fellow African-Americans will
eventually wake up and see that the Democratic party
does not care about their interests, and the party
line about black voters not having anywhere else to go
is a crock.  It is my hope that in the next 4 years
the Green Party can really make inroads in attracting
the votes of minorities and the poor, by showing them
that the issues that matter to those voters are the
same issues that matter to the Green Party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Santa,  <br>
    All I want for Christmas is a real democracy.  Our political system has been in decline for so long, I hope that where we are now is rock bottom.  What should I ask for to expedite the necessary changes in this country?  I'd say citizen participation, but our voices, like our votes, are too frequently lost in the machinery of representative government.  Our needs are so great and there are so many working so hard to implement solutions.  Whether it's a proposal for abolition of the electoral college, direct elections with instant runoff voting, campaign finance reform, third party access, ending racism at the polls or upgrading voting mechanisms, we're still forced to work through our undemocratic &quot;representative&quot; political system and government bureaucracy.  I ask for a way out of this bind.  I ask for citizen empowerment.  I ask for support for and eventual enactment of the Direct Democracy Initiative*. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My truest hope after this fresh debacle of an election is that some Americans have noticed, or have seen their concern grow. I worked on the Nader campaign 
here in DC, and I know how we excited some people around the country that cared about politics already--but weren't ready to care about electoral 
politics, because they'd decided early in life that little of worth could be 
accomplished there. They were right, of course, but it didn't have to be so 
dismal--just because cynicism is correct doesn't mean it should be. Yes, the 
election was stolen--like always, but more clearly--and all so Scalia can be 
the new chief justice? The one thing Ralph got wrong was that, indeed, this 
election was ALL about the Supreme Court. But he was right on the bigger 
point--we can't trust the Court to safeguard any right--we have them, 
inalienably, only when we demand them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for all the other issues, I hope that this current congress moved on only one issue that Americans can agree on: electoral reform. Bring voting methods 
into at least the 20th century, and ideally the 21st--with optical scanned 
ballots nationwide that also are trackable. We need universal suffrage--never 
mind this Motor Voter nonsense, any eligible citizen should be able to decide 
on election day that they want to vote, show up, and do so. This is the true 
need established under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Election Day should be a paid national holiday (keep it on a Tuesday, though, or people will make a three day weekend out of it), as the AFL-CIO has 
recognized--if it's a problem to make another holiday, let's get rid of the 
anachronistic Columbus Day. Of course, Election Day even for Congressional races is only every two years--perhpas we should make it Citizenship Day, so that on off-years we can look at what we've got coming and perhaps organize a national plebiscite on what we want to see addressed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader had most of the rest of it right--a People's Debate Commission, meaningful campaign finance reform, instant runoff voting so that voters can express their true wish without seeming &quot;naive&quot;, and a reinjection of issues people care about into these races. Let's get folks to want to vote again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for Bush--yes, I'm worried about all the damage he can do to the 
environment, human rights, military spending, and our national skid into irrelevance--but this is likely to be a reign by the stupidest president we've had since Rutherford Hayes, and the most corrupt since Ulysses Grant. So, if we keep our eyes open, I'm guessing we'll be able to catch them in some doozies. And I hope that, once we begin to accomplish the above, we can 
end political dynasty-making that both Bush and Gore represent...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One would think the Constitution is made of blotter
acid. The Supreme Court decision stands the concept of
Constitutional Equal Protection on its head.  Yes
voters in Florida were denied Equal Protection, but
they were mainly minority voters who faced roadblocks;
mechanical, institutional and intentional to allowing
their votes to be cast and counted.  Classic Equal
Protection analysis starts with a division into two
groups of people, one being less favored because of
some immutable characteristic such as race.  In
Florida the two obvious groups suffering  disparate
treatment were Black and White.  Figuratively and
literally.  The Supreme Court through its machinations
divides the electorate into two groups.  One group
whose vote might be counted because their intent can
be discerned and a group whose vote won't   be counted
because their intent cannot be discerned.  So? More
legitimate votes would have been counted than not
without the Supreme Court decision..  A decision
utterly without integrity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More importantly, Ralph Nader's campaign was fueled by
the corruption and anti-democratic tendencies in our
system.  This election, particularly the involvement
of the Supreme Court including two judges who should
of recused themselves because of conflicts of
interest, proves his point. If Nader supporters and
Greens through-out the country can  make common cause
with African-Americans to demand an end to the
institutional racism that disenfranchised Florida's
voters, to the common end of building a true
progressive movement, this election can be turned into
a significant victory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elections in the U.S. have never represented the majority of people.  In 
fact, one might say they have always been stolen from us by the upper 
class.  To accuse Bush of stealing the election from Gore misses the 
point.  Most Americans didn't care who won.  The whole point of the system, 
ostensibly, is that it is supposed to give power to people.  That system 
has failed if indeed it ever worked.  Enough with small reforms, let's get 
out there on inauguration day and demonstrate.  The ballot box has long 
failed us, progress will be made when we use direct action.  If you are 
infuriated at how the new ruler has been chosen, join us in DC on January 20 to show your resistance!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only those who for the first time, experience injustice wrapped up and
packaged by supposedly democratic institutions, may be surprised by the&quot;Theft of Florida&quot;. When was this kind of fraud not possible in this
country? Think of Treaties with Native Americans or the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution and other legislation, court decisions and executive orders
enabling not just the theft of an election but the deaths of tens of
millions of human beings...all nice and legal. There are so many other
instances of this same seemingly inevitable dialectic that point to the
distinction between law and right.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are too many others to think that these, like last night's are
abberations. What the cold light of morning must reveal is that naked power
bulks up under the Emperor's constitutional dressings. And,we should
remember that only power may successfully confront power. When ever and
where ever justice and human need have succeeded in this struggle, it has
been through the independent activity of people in motion in their own
interest. When law helps right it is only because it has no other choice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Will the Supreme Court, augmented by Bush appointees, abbrogate abortion
rights? Probably? Will that dismal decision end abortion rights? No. It will
take struggle, demonstrations, defeating some and supporting other
congresspeople, but we will re-gain those lost rights. Yes, I know that
lives will be lost during that time to illegal abortions and even, I can
envision, police brutality so I profouldly wish I could imagine other ways
for history to move. I can not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last night, the slow progress of humanity from the grip of injustice was
again thwarted. Today my perspective was simply put by that greatest of
organizers, Mother Jones -- &quot;Don't Mourn -- Organize!&quot; Come out. The bell
has rung for round number who knows what round --- but the fight goes on ---pick your particular issue and organize, organize, organize.</font></p>
