<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have been constantly bombarded with propaganda for 20 years or more, with the simple but persistent message &quot;Government bad, private business/ownership good&quot;.  Repeated often enough, the message sinks into the collective national subconscious, and the citizenry eventually accepts it as a law of nature, hence not subject to question. 
After that, it's much easier to begin dismantling the government programs and agencies that were established to carry out the goal in the Preamble, &quot;to promote the general welfare&quot;.  In parallel, the propaganda machine has been busy around the world, selling the concept of &quot;privatization&quot; to all who will buy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Look at what's going on in public transportation in the UK.  In a recent article in the Guardian, a British government spokesman was quoted as saying that privatization was the only option to raise enough capital to rebuild the air traffic control system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, here's a novel concept -- if something is needed for the public good, why not impose a tax of some sort to pay for it, then put together a quality product that will be of use to the public for a long time?  How about Interstate Highways and federal gasoline taxes, as an example?  A great system, and the revenue is collected at the gas pump. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the major contributors to the Florida fiasco was the private corporation hired by the state to &quot;cleanse&quot; the voter registration rolls, and their list of 85,000 wrongly classified felons.  Why was such an important civic action entrusted to a non-governmental agency in the first place? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the past few decades we have been witness to the equivalent of the Enclosure of the Commons in England many centuries ago.  Put public property into private hands, so that a few may profit immensely from it.  Consider the spectrum auctions that have been held for the past several years by the FCC.  This is reportedly tied to the Federal Budget Reconciliation Act of 1996.  How much money has this brought into the Treasury, and how much value can be placed on that which has been sold? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is needed to begin turning things around in this country is to open a new public dialogue on the proper role of government in our civic life.  Perhaps Common Dreams can offer the forum. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A parting thought -- in a short span of roughly four years, from about 1933 to 1937, Americans started and completed the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco Bay Bridge, and the Hetch-Hetchy dam and aqueduct.  The last one might ruffle some feathers, but it's the Northern California equivalent of Mulholland's Southern California water system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Folks, these were all public works!  All the bonds were paid off long ago.  Americans once dreamed big, and built on those dreams.  We can do so once more. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you, commondreams.org for doing this forum.  It's long overdue...
and may I suggest doing it again and again on big events.  I concur with
another post that said, &quot;it's the only thing missing from your
website.&quot;  Well said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe it's just me, but having been born in the mid-1960's it has never
been my experience that the Democrat party is/has been progressive by
any real substantive stretch.  When the Greens began forming up I signed
on because I knew there was a genuine substantive difference; Greens
were of and for the people, the Dems and Repubs were just the age-old
aristocracy with slightly differing approaches to their ruling-elite
entitlements.  The end-game of this election charade is more than ample
proof of that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I proudly voted Nader and will vote for  Green candidates over and over
again.  I am proud my vote didn't go to either of the two aristocrats.
I resented the threatening emails and the op-ed pieces perpetrated by
the Gore campaign and the insults and hysterical condemnations of those
around me who were Gore supporters/Democrats leading up to and
immediately following the November 7th &quot;day of infamy.&quot;  How dare they
presume that they were ever entitled to my progressive vote!  I won't
write on this good forum what I really think of the Democrat/Gore
campaign shanigans, except to say this: good, the creepy geek lost to
the obnoxious, narcissistic frat boy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was more un-nerved by the Supreme Court's decision last night than
anything else during the whole boondoggle.  I still can't find words to
express my horror at the majority's brazen flouting of the
Constitution... my g-d, I feel like we'd have to write a whole new
Constitution just to purge ourselves of the filth and evil that their
decision has so besmirched the current one.... I mean, I'm waiting for
the walls in the archives to start bleeding!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that the lesser-evilism fallacy has been proven out, we progressives
(Green or not) ought to endeavor to effectively shut down DC for four
years.  If the aristocracy is permitted to continue on as usual, we
progressives have no one to blame but ourselves.  Not only get
organized, my fellow Americans, get even!  After three hundred years of
aristocratic occupation, it's past time to get our nation back!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Supreme Court handing George W. Bush the United States Presidency is the latest stage in a process that started in the 1960s when the
Right-Wing/Sun Belt-wealth captured the Republican Party and nominated
Barry Goldwater.   The Eastern-dominated ruling class at the time
ganged-up on Goldwater, and Johnson overwhelmingly defeated the
Republican.  Rather than becoming discouraged the Right intensified
their efforts and began to &quot;infiltrate&quot; every political institution in
American life: Congress, the Presidency (Nixon, Reagan, Bush), the
Judiciary, the corporate- media, policy planning organizations, and
think tanks, et.al.  The goal was to roll back the New Deal, eliminate
all social legislation aimed to defend workers, minorities and women,
promote a &quot;strict&quot; interpretation of the constitution, and establish a
theocracy (See: Sara Diamond's Road to Dominion).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simultaneously the Eastern-dominated corporate interests also began to
shift to the right, willing to allow the New-Deal/Keynesian regime FDR
put into place to be eroded; thus giving &quot;legitimacy&quot; to the  Right.
In fact, the Eastern interests went into a loose coalition with the
Right to back Reagan because of overlapping interests (confront
socialism throughout the world and revive military spending).   Clinton
(at the behest of the Democratic Leadership Council) upset the
Right/Republicans by stealing their rhetoric and programs and regain the
White House.  His project was more in line with the Eastern-economic
interests who endorse(d) an enlightened- &quot;managed&quot;
imperialism/globalization.  Since the moment Clinton became a serious
candidate the Right/Republicans began to discredit him, and, once he was
elected, began trying to get the White House back by using every legal
and unconstitutional means at its disposal, including massive media
propaganda.   That effort failed to remove Clinton, however, nothing was
going to stop them from beating Gore.   When Bush, in an unprecedented
press conference on the night of the election, said he was going to win
Florida he meant it.   Since November 7 Bush's team has tried to prevent
votes from being counted, while Gore has selectively defended the&quot;cherished&quot; principle of the &quot;right to suffrage&quot; (&quot;one person, one
vote&quot;).   Importantly that principle has become the main means by which
the capitalist class has maintained its &quot;legitimacy&quot; over the working
classes.  The over riding question that I have is why has the ruling
class agreed to allow the right of suffrage to be abolished/certainly
seriously undermined to enable Bush (and his right-wing cabal) gain the
White House?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am Canadian so forgive me if this is &quot;none of my
business&quot; but consider as food for thought the
following: in Canada's recent federal election, over
17,000,000 IDENTICAL ballots were cast BY HAND (no
machines allowed) over several time zones and then
counted BY HAND (for greater accuracy) in under four
hours.  The election was overseen and the ballots
counted by Elections Canada, an independent,
non-partisan body created by federal statute.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have to say that I am simply flabbergasted by what
has happened in your country.  Some weeks ago (when
all of this started) I was sent the following snippet
from an e-mail I understand originated from someone in
Zimbabwe.  It is eerily premonitory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;1.  Imagine that we read of an election occurring
anywhere in the third world in which the self-declared
winner was the son of the former prime minister and
that former prime minister was himself the former head
of that nation's secret police.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.  Imagine that the self-declared winner lost the
popular vote but won based on some old colonial
holdover known as the electoral college.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.  Imagine that the self-declared winner's 'victory'
turned on disputed votes cast in a province governed
by his brother.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.  Imagine that the poorly drafted ballots of one
district, a district heavily favoring the
self-declared winner's opponent, led thousands of
voters to vote for the wrong candidate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.  Imagine that members of that nation's most
despised caste, fearing for their livelihoods, turned
out in record numbers to vote in near-universal
opposition to the self-declared winner's candidacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6.  Imagine that hundreds of members of that
most-despised caste were intercepted on their way to
the polls by state police operating under the
authority of the self-declared winner's brother.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.  Imagine that six million people voted in the
disputed province and that the self-declared winner's
'lead' was only 327 votes -- fewer, certainly, than
the vote-counting machines' margin of
error.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.  Imagine that the self-declared winner and his
political party opposed a  more careful by-hand
inspection and re-counting of the ballots in the
disputed province or in its most hotly disputed
district.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9.  Imagine that the self-declared winner, himself a
governor of a major province, had the worst human
rights record of any province in his nation and
actually led the nation in executions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. Imagine that a major campaign promise of the
self-declared winner was to appoint like-minded human
rights violators to lifetime positions on the high
court of that nation.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All  of us, I imagine, would wearily turn the page
thinking that it was another sad tale of a pitiful
people in some strange elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I might add: imagine that this country's electoral
result was decided by fiercely partisan &quot;judges&quot; who
were originally appointed as a political pay-off, some
of whom were appointed during a time when the father
of the self-declared winner was either Vice President
or President of the United States.</font></p>

of us!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for this forum.  The US Supreme Court has, in a decision which 
will be as infamous as Dred Scott and Plessy, run out the clock on the 
recounts in Florida.  However, it did not remove all controversies 
surrounding the certification of Florida's electors by 12 December 2000 
(the deadline for electors to be immune from challenge).  Hence, under 
the authority of 3 USC section 5, the Florida electors are subject to 
challenge by the US Congress under the authority of 3 USC section 15.  
The Florida electors received their tainted certification under a cloud 
of voter intimidation, voter misinformation, canvassing board 
malfeasance, and de facto discriminatory use of antiquated and 
failure-prone voting equipment in black, brown, and poor districts.  To 
allow these tainted electors to cast their votes without challenge in 
the election of the 43rd President would be like Fannie Lou Hamer not 
challenging the Mississippi Delegation to the 1964 Democratic National 
Convention.  We should all be sick and tired of being sick and tired.  
Call your Representative and Senators (there needs to be a Senator and 
Representative to challenge, under 3 USC section 15) and demand they 
submit a written challenge to the tainted Florida electors on 6 January 
2001. </font>  </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poopchute. If anything comes of this election, it should be that liberals will get 
their act together.  That is the only possible good that can come of this 
terrible turn of events.  People across the country need to sober up to the 
fact that the conservative ideology is inherently unjust.  Can you believe 
the conservative judges actually decided that any effort to count tens of 
thousands of undervotes was UNCONSTITUTIONAL?  I say the democrats should have conceded the dimpled chads issue because there must have been plenty of votes where the intent was more clear.  Also, in reference to the argument 
about consistent canvassing board standards across the state, the 
republicans had the democrats in a catch -22.  On the one hand they courts 
are accused of changing the laws after the election, and then the 
republicans go on to complain that the precedent doesn't give a uniform 
standard.  What ever happened to the republican ideal of local control and 
trusting the people?  And the margin was only 170 or so votes, being less 
than the margin of error attributed to the machines themselves!  Did anybody 
hear about how 600 ballots in one county were thrown out as overvotes when 
somebody punched the ballot and wrote in the SAME candidate?  I guess the 
republicans only care about letting the intent of the voter count when its 
on their side.  Speaking of the absentee ballot case, I have a question for 
somebody regarding what i thought was the central question of those cases.  
How many democratic absentee ballot applications were thrown out on 
technicalities as compared to republican ones?  Were any of these 
applications given a second chance as well?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before I go I have something I'd like to pass on to all my fellow 
progressives.  Start to spread the word about a possible Warren Beatty 
candidacy for next election.  I don't know how many of you noticed his 
presidential taunting last year, but he had some really great things to say. 
  Even though most people only know him from movies, he's also a closet 
politician.  Now I loved Nader's ideas and integrity just as much as 
anybody, but lets be realistic the public will never get past his unorthodox 
persona.  Beatty has the same kind of ideas but he can also go mainstream.  
What the liberals need is somebody who can be a leader not a complainer.  
Fortunately, Beatty has the charm that Nader lacked.  Lets face it, to be a 
politician you gotta be smooth.  The beautiful part is that Beatty can ACT 
smooth.  So everybody just keep him in mind and listen if he decides to 
speak.  Hey Scalia!  Bite me you black hearted pig!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I agree with the general consensus that we need electoral reform.  Let me
also point out that HUGE differences can be made on a local level when
people like us form third parties, run for and win local positions; look at
all the successful living wage campaigns around the country, the (more or
less) progressive District Attoney's office in San Francisco, affordable
housing movements, etc.  I urge everyone to get involved in their local
chapters of the Green Party, New Party or other progressive political
group.  True democracy and democratic power start from the ground up.  We can begin by outright refusing to condone injustice in our own communities
while we continue to fight for nationwide reform.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I am impressed by the statements made here and can add only that I
didn't vote for good reason. In fact, that is exactly what about half of
the voting age population did!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My thinking went like this -- the US is supposed to be a REPUBLIC,
meaning we select representatives in lieu of self-government or
democracy. While I don't like it, and perfer to make laws and policy on
the national level by direct popular vote or Direct Democracy, I
nevertheless am willing to compromise by scruples to vote for a&quot;representative&quot; candidate for local, state or federal office -- if they
ARE representative of my values, not merely the choice among
non-representatives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore didn't represent me when he switched his position on MX missle
deployment to create a tie-vote in the US Senate in order to faciliate
then VP George Bush to break it and approve that first strike nuclear
weapons system. I don't forget, and lack the authority to forgive acts
committed against humanity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course the Bush cabal is no better, and is likewise
un-representative, so that leaves Nader and the Greens. Well, Ralph
didn't oppose the military draft or US military aggression in Indochina,
nor like the Greens, he didn't oppose aid to the Nicaraguan contras, an
act that got the US convicted twice in the World Court for war crimes.
In fact wasn't a critic of the Gulf War, invasions of Panama or Grenada.
And then there was Yugoslavia, and more conniving complicity. I am
waiting to hear the Greens denounce Israel for its fascist aggression
against the Palestinians.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, you see, don't dismiss those who didn't vote, they may know as much,
and even care much more than those who did, regardless of tabulations,
the ballot itself was void of sustance, an affront the concept of free
and fair elections -- a charade and prima facia fruad with or without
honest and complete tabulations.</font></p>

this feature back from time to time, it's the only thing missing from your
great website. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now... I too voted for Nader and would do so again, even with the knowledge
of the past 5 weeks events. While Gore may or may not have gotten the most votes in FL on Nov. 7, he certainly would have if so many African Americans hadn't been illegally removed from the voting rolls, or been intimidated by
police and hostile poll workers from voting.  Not that Gore &quot;deserved&quot; to
win.  Despite the stealing of this election by Bush with the help of the
Supreme Court, the real reason Gore lost is because he and his party have
abandoned their core constituents on the Left.  Let Nader's success and
Gore's defeat remind the Democrats that they are no longer part of the
solution, but part of the problem, and that they must either move left or
get out of the way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
In the meantime, we must continue to resist this coup d'etat and fight the
Bush presidency as an illegitimate regime.  I don't know what's worse, the
actions by the Court, or the intimidation of minorities and other 'dirty
tricks' on Election day.  Either way, this debacle has shown to the rest of
the world that America is no better at holding 'democratic' elections than
Yugoslavia or Peru.  It shames me to be American.</font></p>

I suggest people protest on Inauguration Day, and afterwards, and to fly the
American flag upside-down (as a sign of distress) for the theft of our
democracy. </font></p>

If there were a way that we could have re-elected that senile, octogenarian actor, Ronald Regan, we would have.  The very fact that we allow the media (and the political and corporate masters they serve) to convince us that these endless campaigns and partisan struggles for power represent &quot;freedom of choice&quot; is a constant indictment of our unreadiness to experience true Democracy.  The horrible farce that Election 2000 became only emphasizes the irrelevance of American politics.  The Hague talks have proven that Americans cannot endorse even the most basic of accepted environmental truths: that Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to prevent catastrophic climate change.  It serves us right that George W. Bush is our President, we don't deserve any better.</font></p>
