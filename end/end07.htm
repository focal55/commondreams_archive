<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What a great, grand treat to come to the screen and be greeted by dozens and hundreds - come on, let's make it thousands! - of messages from sensible, thinking citizens from all over the nation. We're here and we ain't going away!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  The election, for me, was not a disappointment because I never expected much from the voting 45%-of-the-electorate Republocrats. If (as Jim Hightower suggests) half those voting for either of the two corporate candidates were actually voting against, or in fear of, the other, the Bush-boy's mandate is about 11 or 12% of the voting-eligible population. What's that, maybe 6 or 7% of the whole nation? Indeed watching those two scoundrels and their truthspeak talking robots was better than a carny show. What lovely 'though hideous irony to watch these hypocrite Republicans become the horror envisioned by Orwell. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   And the Congress - best damned hucksterism since the impeachment posturing. They no longer need a clergyman opening sessions. It's far too late for that. They need a patent medicine barker. Maybe a compromise: Upjohn hires Pat Robertson who tag-teams with Jerry Falwell. Thurmond in one corner, dozing off, chasing small animals in his dreams, drooling on himself and DeLay on the opposite end, snorting rat poison or whatever it was that turned him into whatever he is. James Carvell (or however his name is spelled) referees in seriously baggy, sequined tights borrowed from Gov. Jesse Ventura, Rev. Jesse Jackson makes and plays the odds with his eyes on his own prize, and Greenspan fixes the ticket prices. And so on and so on and so on. You fill in the blanks. </font></p>

   As for the press - well, it is the press and not much can be expected. It's like the whole kit and caboodle got dropped on it's head in its infancy. </font></p>

   The real tragedy of this comedy was the disgrace of the Supreme Court. What shame and what a shame. Enough said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Meanwhile, my friends, we continue. I agree, don't mourn, organize. Don't be bitter, let's get better. The issues are now in the open. Four years ago ( I accidentally hit the &quot;t&quot; key and wrote &quot;four tears ago.&quot; That would be appropriate as well wouldn't it? But as we've said, let's not mourn, let's organize) ... four years ago the populace did not know the word, much less the danger of, corporatization. Now, everyone is aware of it. Four years hence, they'll understand &quot;deep democracy.&quot; And four years after that we'll all take back control of our lives, our environment, our government, our cities and our souls. Freedom's not complicated. We just have to demand it with every act, every thought, every breath. Nothing less will do.</font></p>

I'm a college student who is horrified by what's happened.  However, my hometown news too only reports on the supposed &quot;unity&quot; that's now going on.  Even my college newspaper and Democratic party are talking about this.  What no one seems to want to see or acknowledge is that many, many people are still very, very upset and dissatisfied.  For instance, there is a bus full of students that is going to rally in DC next month during the inauguration.  I'm planning on being on that bus - but you wouldn't know that if you didn't' feel like I do about the end result of this election.  All is not fine, all are not &quot;united&quot;.  The wrong cannot be taken away, ignored, made over into false niceness.  Finally having a President does not mean we have to give up those things which we believe in, give up the fight.  Sure, I'll stand behind the President, George W. Bush.  I'll stand behind him to push him towards a better America, where corruption, racism, homophobia, religious tyranny and oppression of women is thwarted.  I'll stand behind him so he cannot turn around and send us back to the Dark Ages.  I am patriotic, I love this country... and I'm not gonna let it become ugly. </font>      </p>

  Time to organize local groups into people who do for themselves. Form
buying groups to purchase things cheaper. Form recycling centers to make
money for the group. Form community centers to provide day-care, help
with schooling, to provide training for people to get jobs. To bring the
older people together with younger people, to learn. To work with other
groups like Habitat for Humanity. All this was done before without government help. It can be done
again. I for one am tired of bureaucracy. People feel more useful doing
something. Time to stop putting so much knowledge into nursing homes. We
are losing our worth as human beings. We are losing ourselves, and
souls. So much valuable 
resources going to waste. Hey America, we don't need the bureaucrats.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi!  I just subscribe, and I'm forwarding and e-mail I just sent to the 
person that suggested that I should subscribe to Common Dream</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mar&iacute;a Elena:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Fourteen months ago, when you and I began to exchange e-mails regarding 
who should be elected president on Nov/2000 .... it was already too late; and 
we're, again, going to miss the next presidential election unless we begin 
right now to capitalize the fact that it was this nation's crooked electoral 
laws what brought an intellectually deficient person to the White House.  I 
believe that we should begin, together with the rest of our electronic 
friends, to kick around some ideas with the purpose of, first, making of Bush 
a 4-year president, and, second, of inducing the 100 million non-voters to 
vote, and here're some thoughts and a suggestion:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    It's evident now that -- notwithstanding the eloquent doublespeak we're 
about to hear -- Congress won't pass in the near future a campaign reform, so 
the next two national electoral battles will have to be fought according to 
the present rules, that is with a lot of money.  If millions of non-voters 
were to begin to contribute one dollar per month to a campaign fund for third 
party candidates committed to pass a new electoral law, power could be 
restored to the people; and we should not wait for self-appointed candidates 
to be lured by this money, but should begin to advertise for them with ads 
like:</font></p>
<p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; WANTED: Candidates for the congressional elections of 2002 and for 
the 
congressional and presidential ones of 2004. Successful applicants will be 
adequately financed but only for these elections,as they must make of a total 
campaign reform -- where all elections are financed only and exclusively with public money -- their main legislative objective when elected. Career 
politicians needn't apply. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    How about it?  This. of course, needs a lot of kicking around -- like 
who's going to guard the campaign fund (maybe Ralph's Public Citizen) -- but 
if we could get something like this going, initially through the Internet, I 
promise two things: 1) I'll live four more years, and 2) I'll become a U.S. 
citizen in order to vote for these third party candidates.</font></p>

today, the tone of the political parties and the media have set me back. The 
GOP, for a change, want to work in a bipartisan manner. The Dems are thrilled 
they can all work together. The media is pushing these attitudes onto the 
people, as we sit and watch the spectacle before our eyes. Last week, the two

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think what we will end up taking away from this mess is a sense of all the failures. Failures on all our parts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don&#146;t really blame folks for voting for Nader, but I do think Ralph failed to put the country ahead of his ego by focusing so much effort in states he KNEW he could &#150; and did &#150; act like a spoiler to get Dubya into the Oval Office.  Nader failed us, his cause, and the rest of us. Save us from the righteously pure but darn foolish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don&#146;t really blame people for not realizing what a bunch of baloney all the stuff the &#147;unofficial&#148; Bush promoters were putting out there. Of course one has to be pretty silly to believe the liars of the NRA or the AM radio yak-bozos about anything to do with politics. Folks might also of have asked themselves why on Earth Albert Gore Junior would be sending &#147;jack-booted BATF thugs&#148; after their hunting shotguns? When had this REALLY ever happened except to criminals, and insane child-abusers like Koresh or the Randy Weavers? How on Earth they&#146;d expect a right-wing Congress to approve such a thing as a gun raids on law abiding citizens? But the newsmedia either went along with this kind of nonsense (like that Al Gore claimed to have &#147;invented the Internet&#148; when he did no such thing, but actually WAS one of the Founding Fathers of it). Or how they ignored it -- as they did so many of the really important issues &#150; like why DID George W. Bush get a new driver&#146;s license in 1995 unless it was to purge his record?  The corporate newsmedia certainly failed us and the very profession of journalism this year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But so did the American (Mis)Education system.  People are so carefully taught never to read, to never really study history (at least the History Channel &#150; for all its inaccuracies &#150; is opening up some folks to the lure), and never-ever to use reasoning. Just as they are carefully NOT taught how to detect BS and propaganda.  That is a big reason so few young folks voted. They did not realize how much it really does matters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Imagine if we had been wise enough as a nation back in 1980 to have seen Ronald Reagan as but a shallow shill for Big Oil and kept him on his ranch.  We might well have large numbers of hybrid or pure fuel-cell vehicles, using natural gas/hydrogen produced from biomass and solar energy. Safe and smart cars that go fast enough to keep folks happy and go 300 or more miles on ten bucks worth of fuel. Have decentralized small power plants. The resulting pollution &#150; distilled water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We of us who *knew* what a bad joke on America GovReagan was, what a con-man and traitor Pappy Bush really was, we failed to get the word out to those who have never had the chance to catch on to the flimflam.  And we failed to make it clear that for all his flaws, Al Gore was a decent and qualified candidate.  Infinitely more honest and more caring about what really matters that the overgrown brat from Midland, Texas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was not a question of picking the lesser of two evils &#150; it was rather the choice between a good person who COULD be a decent or even great president (look to see what FDR campaigned for in his first election sometime) and now one who well might be nearly as disastrous for America and the world as Reagan and Bush proved to be.  At least Dubya will not get to extend the Cold War a decade, nor do I think he will be allowed to stick us 3 trillion in debt.  But he will find other ways to screw us over that you can bet on. Like he did investors in his &quot;oil companies&quot; (while thumbing his nose at the SEC who let the then President's boy get away with insider trading), or the bemused Texas taxpayers who gave him millions just for the use of his name in that stinky Texas Rangers deal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I agree with Stanley Greenberg - there was a cultural war waged against
Clinton/Gore that the Republicans capitalized on. Clinton was impeached.
Gore served with a president who was put on trial and brought before the
senate. That is not an easy thing to overcome and in fact he did
overcome it but he could not overcome the racist, corrupt machinery of
his opponent's brother's state - nor could he overcome the rabid right
wing friends of his opponent's father, five of whom were on the Supreme
court and one of whom, James Baker, is evil incarnate. Gore's message
and his forward vision is right for this country - he won the popular
vote by more than 500,000 - being hobbled by Clinton and Nader. No one
should second guess Gore's message - it was and is right. Don't try to
fashion a good and, in fact, winning vision to accommodate a perception that is mired in convoluted and corrupt logic and events.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, I bought my first new car. I hadn't owned a car since 
1985! It was time and the price was right. One of the first things I did when 
I bought the car, was put on my &quot;Don't Blame Me, I Voted For Nader&quot; 
bumpersticker on the bumper that I bought in 1997 and held onto. 
Since everyone is blaming Ralph Nader and the Greens for stealing the 
election for Gore, I had to take the bumper sticker off my car. But, I am 
ready for some new ones ... I don't know ... something like:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'D STILL VOTE FOR RALPH NADER <br>
or<br>
AL GORE COST RALPH NADER THE PRESIDENCY<br>
or <br>
FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS VOTE REPUBLICRAT</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the end, the election really was stolen from Ralph Nader, who really was 
the most qualified of all the candidates and if we had a real electoral 
system, he would have won hands down. 
This year, Al Gore and his Democratic friends ran the filthiest, most 
disgusting campaign in American history, against Ralph Nader and the Greens, 
doing everything in their power to steal and scare votes away from us. They 
wasted millions and millions of dollars and still, they couldn't win the 
presidency. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I feel bad for everyone at this outcome: 
From the blacks who were purged from the voter rolls because the Motor Voter 
Law states that if registered voters don't vote in consecutive Federal 
election cycles, they are to be removed; To the complaints from black 
Republicans in Little Haiti who said that Democrats were in the polling 
places telling immigrants who couldn't read the ballots to vote a straight 
Democratic ticket (This was a corroborated report I saw on WSVN-TV while 
vacationing in Fla. right after Election Day, that has been ignored by the 
corporate press.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the end, the laugh is really on the Democrats. 
For years, they have stolen elections. And now they act all upset when karma 
comes back and bites them in the behind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1960, Lyndon Johnson fixed Texas and Big Boss Mayor Richard Daley (son of 
Gore fixer Bill Daley) fixed Chicago to give the election to JFK. Here in 
Boston, elections have always been fixed by Democrats; from the joke about 
waiting for the count from St. Paul's Cemetery to come in, to the 10-15 
people illegally registering and voting in two-family apartments in 
Somervilles they didn't actually live in. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
Janet Reno ignored voter irregularities and outright charges of voter fraud 
over and over again in South Florida (documented by the great book &quot;Vote 
Scam&quot; by James Collier). In 1996, non-citizens registered and voted for 
Democrat Loretta Sanchez against that right wing thug B-1 Bob Dornan in 
California. Somehow, stealing the election from Dornan was okay because he 
was a nut. In 1997, the Democratic Miami Mayor stole the election by fixing 
absentee ballots. He was later found guilty and a court threw the guy out of 
office. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year, in Wisconsin, hundreds of college kids registered and voted 
numerous times to see if they could get away with it. Thousands of felons in 
Florida illegally registered and voted, almost 80% of which were registered 
Democrats. And then in the re-count, Democrats handed out a five page 
memorandum on how to eliminate and have thrown out, legitimate overseas 
military ballots, the majority of which would have gone to Bush. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So much for wanting every vote counted. They whole rotten bunch of them are pathetic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Absolutely. Organization is what &quot;won&quot; the election for Shrub, of
mindless hordes by master organizers Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, the
Mormon Cult, Gingrich, Limbaugh, Ralph Reed and a menagerie of others.
They are masters of manipulation, with media empires and fund-raising
mills that generate fabulous sums, and they have spent so many years out
of power (out of control, as they see it) they have had little more to
do but grow their empires and practice for the hostile takeover of the
government (Ralph Reed bragged years ago that liberals would wake up in
body bags the morning after the election, remember?). In skirmishes
before the main event, they mobilized to fight abortion, defeat
gay-rights initiatives, and attack affirmative action, captured the
House and Senate, then tried to wreck Bill Clinton and the Presidency.
Now they have mobilized their critical mass of automatons to &quot;elect&quot;
another Bush. We have seen from their success what we now have to do,
but where is the unity of mind and purpose among folks on the left that
is equal to the oneness of mind and devotion to purpose of folks on the
right?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The system as we all know is rotten to and through the core and it must
be deconstructed before it can be rebuilt.  I believe that no matter how
painful, Dubya as President gives us a much better chance of this
happening than Gore would.  The lack of Emperor's clothing has already
become more apparent to the mass of people than it had been previously.
The hypocrisy, dishonesty and outright meanness of those who control the
Republican machine is in much plainer view than usual and it will
continue to be over the next (gasp) 4 years.  Dubya is going to be a
catalyst for mobilizing the forces of change against a system whose&quot;ism&quot; is capitol instead of human, and this will be the greatest revenge
on the right wing (actually the greatest revenge would be if there is an actual judgment day and they have to answer for themselves).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reason this is good thing and, in fact, a better thing than Al Gore
as President; is because Al Gore wouldn't be such a catalyst yet he
would lead us down a very similar road.  Look, if Al Gore really
believed that what occurred was basically a coup and if he really had
such a deep commitment to &quot;fighting for the people&quot; then he wouldn't
have conceded so meekly and President Clinton wouldn't be saying that we
should give Bush a chance and pass some of his programs.  They all work
for the same people and they all know it and while they agree to
disagree on some things (important things no doubt) they basically agree to agree on most of the important ideological issues i.e.  the market
rules and making the world and keeping the country safe for big business
is the primary task.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It must be deconstructed (it can collapse but that would be more
painful) and I really believe (hope) that an overt illegitimate
President will speed us towards that in a way that a covert illegitimate
one wouldn't.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
