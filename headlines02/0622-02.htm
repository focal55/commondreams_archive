police have been accused of fabricating evidence against anti-globalization protesters 
at last year's G8 summit in Genoa by planting petrol bombs at their headquarters

</table>According to a magistrates' investigation, the police improvised lies to justify 
a blood soaked raid at the Diaz school, which was being used by protesters as 
a headquarters. The raid, which left dozens injured after being kicked, punched 
and beaten with batons, prompted an international outcry. 
<P>It emerged this week that senior police officers have been placed under investigation 
for allegedly making false statements as part of a cover-up. 
<P>At a press conference the day after the July 21 raid the police presented an 
array of weapons which they said were seized at the school and proved the occupants 
were part of the violent Black Bloc anarchists who rioted during the summit. 
<P>Two petrol bombs were displayed as the most damning evidence and prosecutors 
said all 93 occupants, including five Britons, could be charged with conspiracy 
to bomb and jailed for five years if found guilty. 
<P>Genoa magistrates investigating the raid now suspect the Molotov cocktails 
had in fact been found by police in the center of the city, seven hours before 
the midnight raid. 
<P>Earlier this month Pasquale Guaglione, a deputy police chief, told investigators 
that his unit discovered two petrol bombs behind a bush on Via Corso Italia, the 
scene of fierce rioting, and passed them on to a mobile patrol to take back to 
the police station. 
<P>Mr Guaglione said the labels on the wine bottles - a "Merlot" and a "Colli 
Piacentini" - were the same as those supposedly seized at the school. Genoa's 
police station had no record of receiving the petrol bombs from the mobile patrol 
- a unit from Rome which took part in that night's raid. 
<P>A colleague based in Florence has supported Mr Guaglione's testimony but yesterday 
a member of the Rome-based unit involved in the raid told the magistrates that 
he had seen the petrol bombs at the school. 
<P>The national chief of police, Gianni De Gennaro, appeared to endorse the allegations 
of fabrication by saying any officer who lied would be fired. He complained that 
the entire force should not be discredited by the behavior of a few individual 
officers. 
<P>It also emerged this week that investigators no longer believe a police officer 
who said a protester tried to stab him in the chest during the raid on the school 
- a claim which was used last July to suggest the occupants were violent and resisted 
arrest. 
<P>The rip in his bullet proof jacket was not consistent with a knife and the 
police officer may be charged with false testimony, according to investigators 
quoted in Italian media reports. The Rome daily La Repubblica said a "fragile 
mountain of lies" against the anti-globalization movement was crumbling. 
<P>The Group of Eight summit was the international debut of Italy's new prime 
minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and police sealed off much of the city to keep hundreds 
of thousands of protesters away from delegates including George Bush of the US, 
Tony Blair and Vladimir Putin of Russia. 
<P>Street battles erupted when police baton-charged protesters who had been infiltrated 
by the Black Bloc movement of violent anarchists, leaving Genoa a smoking wreck 
and a rioter shot dead by police.</p>
