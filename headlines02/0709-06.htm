<p> BARCELONA, Spain&nbsp; - Protesters stormed the stage and shouted down the 
U.S. health secretary on Tuesday at the world's biggest AIDS conference, demanding 
Washington do more to bridge a gulf in access to care between rich and poor.

</table></font>Some 30 AIDS activists rushed forward as U.S. Health and  Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson got up to speak, while  dozens more drowned out his words with chants and whistles.<P>The protesters accuse Washington of failing people with  AIDS by not committing more money to a new international global  fund against the disease. Thompson, shielded by bodyguards,  delivered his speech unheard.<P>Economist Jeffrey Sachs, an adviser on development to U.N.  Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said Thompson should not have  been surprised at his reception.<P>"It is a reflection of the utter confusion within the  United States government about what they are actually doing,"  he said, accusing President Bush's administration of lacking a  plan to fight AIDS.<P>The week-long meeting, attended by 15,000 delegates, has  highlighted the difference in prospects of those infected with  the virus that causes AIDS in the rich West and in developing  countries. The poorer group make up 95 percent of infections.<P>A stream of new antiretroviral drugs in recent years means  AIDS is no longer an automatic death sentence. But it continues  to claim millions of lives in poor countries where expensive  combination therapy is available to only a few.<P>The AIDS conference, in its second day, heard alarming new  forecasts on the advance of the epidemic. One study said HIV  infections among the young were set to soar by more than 70  percent by the end of the decade.<P>WOMEN'S AIDS CRISIS<P>Top U.N. AIDS official Peter Piot said high rates of AIDS  among young African women would lead to a population imbalance  that would take generations to overcome.<P>The World Health Organization held out hope to developing  countries, saying three million HIV/AIDS sufferers in poor  countries could receive life-saving drugs by 2005. It launched  new guidelines aimed at making anti-AIDS drugs easier to  administer in poor countries without health infrastructure.<P>The U.N.'s Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  Malaria, created in 2001, aims to bridge the healthcare gap --  but has so far won commitments from governments of only $2.8  billion, against the $10 billion it needs each year.<P>In a text of his speech, Thompson said the United States  was leading the world in its support for the fund by committing  $500 million, but activists said $300 million was "stolen" from  other health programs.<P>Sachs said he believed the United States should set aside  $2.5 billion for the global fund in 2003 and $1 billion for  bilateral programs to combat AIDS.<P>The global fund's new executive director, Richard Feachem,  told delegates that existing pledges were a start but billions  more dollars were needed.<P>"These commitments will double the current number of people  receiving HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) in the  developing world and in Africa HAART recipients will increase  six-fold," he said. "This is nothing like enough."<P>The global fund will agree on detailed financial  projections on revenue and spending at its third board meeting  in October.<P>Currently, a mere 0.1 percent of the 28.5 million people  infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa get modern drugs.<P>VACCINE CAUTION<P>Drug firms unveiled more progress in developing innovative  AIDS therapies but anger over the cost of treatments prompted  noisy protests by AIDS activists and the invasion of company  stands at the conference exhibition.<P>Experts dampened speculation that the holy grail of an  effective vaccine against AIDS could be less than five years  away, warning that developing protection against the killer  virus would be a long haul.<P>However, Robert Gallo, the U.S. scientist who co-discovered  HIV, said treatment in the West was set to undergo a  revolution, fueled by new drugs that stop the virus entering  cells.<P>The first drug of this type, dubbed T-20, was presented at  the conference on Monday by Swiss drug firm Roche Holding AG  and U.S. biotech firm Trimeris Inc and could reach the market  early next year.<P>Among pharmaceutical advances reported on Tuesday, the  world's biggest producer of AIDS drugs, GlaxoSmithKline Plc,  reported early progress in developing the first of another  experimental class of drugs called integrase inhibitors.<P>Doctors and drug firms are also making advances in ever  more complicated drug cocktails to hold HIV at bay, although  there is still no sign of a permanent cure since "sleeping"  reservoirs of virus will always remain in the body.
