<p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 — The Central Intelligence Agency has refused to provide 
Congress a comprehensive report on its role in a possible American campaign against 
Iraq, setting off a bitter dispute between the agency and leaders of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee, Congressional leaders said today.</p>
<P> In a contentious, closed-door Senate hearing today, agency officials refused 
to comply with a request from the committee for a broad review of how the intelligence 
community's clandestine role against the government of Saddam Hussein would be 
coordinated with the diplomatic and military actions that the Bush administration 
is planning. </p>
<P> Lawmakers said they were further incensed because the director of central 
intelligence, George J. Tenet, who had been expected to testify about the Iraq 
report, did not appear at the classified hearing. A senior intelligence official 
said Mr. Tenet was meeting with President Bush. Instead, the agency was represented 
by the deputy director, John McLaughlin, and Robert Walpole, the national intelligence 
officer for strategic and nuclear programs. </p>
<P> The agency rejected the committee's request for a report. After the rejection, 
Congressional leaders accused the administration of not providing the information 
out of fear of revealing divisions among the State Department, C.I.A., Pentagon 
and other agencies over the Bush administration's Iraq strategy. </p>
<P> Government officials said that the agency's response also strongly suggested 
that Mr. Bush had already made important decisions on how to use the C.I.A. in 
a potential war with Iraq. One senior government official said it appeared that 
the C.I.A. did not want to issue an assessment of the Bush strategy that might 
appear to be "second-guessing" of the president's plans. </p>
<P> The dispute was the latest of several confrontations between the C.I.A. and 
Congress over access to information about a range of domestic and foreign policy 
matters. Just last week, lawyers for the General Accounting Office and Vice President 
Dick Cheney argued in federal court over whether the White House must turn over 
confidential information on the energy policy task force that Mr. Cheney headed 
last year.</p>
<P> The C.I.A,'s rejection of the Congressional request, which some lawmakers 
contend was heavily influenced by the White House, comes as relations between 
the agency and Congress have badly deteriorated. The relations have soured over 
the ongoing investigation by a joint House-Senate inquiry — composed of members 
of the Senate and House intelligence committees — into the missed signals before 
the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
<P> Mr. Tenet in particular has been a target of lawmakers. Last Friday, Mr. Tenet, 
a former Senate staffer himself, wrote a scathing letter to the leaders of the 
joint Congressional inquiry, denouncing the panel for writing a briefing paper 
that questioned the honesty of a senior C.I.A. official before he even testified.</p>
<P> A senior intelligence official said Mr. Tenet's absence at the hearing today 
was unavoidable, and that no slight was intended. The official said that he missed 
the hearing because he was at the White House with Mr. Bush, helping to brief 
other Congressional leaders on Iraq. The official said Mr. Tenet had advised the 
committee staff several days ago that he would not be able to attend. Mr. Tenet 
has promised to testify about the matter in another classified hearing on Friday, 
officials said. </p>
<P> One Congressional official said that the incident has badly damaged Mr. Tenet's 
relations with Congress, something that Mr. Tenet had always worked hard to cultivate. 
</p>
<P> "I hope we aren't seeing some schoolyard level of petulance," by the C.I.A., 
the official said. </p>
<P> While the House and Senate intelligence oversight committee have received 
classified information about planned covert operations against Iraq, the C.I.A. 
has not told lawmakers how the agency and the Bush administration see those operations 
fitting into the larger war on Iraq, or the global war on terrorism, Congressional 
officials said. </p>
<P> "What they haven't told us is how does the intelligence piece fit into the 
larger offensive against Iraq, or how do these extra demands on our intelligence 
capabilities effect our commitment to the war on terrorism in Afghanistan," said 
one official. </p>
<P> Congressional leaders complained that they have been left in the dark on how 
the intelligence community will be used just as they are about to debate a resolution 
to support war with Iraq. </p>
<P> Congressional leaders said the decision to fight the Congressional request 
may stem from a fear of exposing divisions within the intelligence community over 
the administration's Iraq strategy, perhaps including a debate between the agency 
and the Pentagon over the military's role in intelligence operations in Iraq.</p>
<P> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has been moving to strengthen his control 
over the military's intelligence apparatus, potentially setting up a turf war 
for dominance among American intelligence officials. Mr. Rumsfeld has also been 
pushing to expand the role of American Special Operations Forces into covert operations, 
including activities that have traditionally been the preserve of the C.I.A. </p>
<P> Congressional leaders asked for the report in July, and expressed particular 
discontent that the C.I.A. did not respond for two months. Lawmakers had asked 
that the report be provided in the form of a national intelligence estimate, a 
formal document that is supposed to provide a consensus judgment by the several 
intelligence agencies.</p>
<P> The committee wanted to see whether analysts at different agencies, including 
the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and 
the State Department, have sharply differing views about the proper role of the 
intelligence community in Iraq. </p>
<P> But intelligence officials say that a national intelligence estimate is designed 
to assess the policies of foreign countries — not those of the United States. 
"They were asking for an assessment of U.S. policy, and that falls outside the 
realm of the N.I.E., and it gets into the purview of the commander in chief," 
an intelligence official said. </p>
<P> Committee members have also expressed anger that the C.I.A. refused to fully 
comply with a separate request for another national intelligence estimate, one 
that would have provided an overview of the intelligence community's latest assessment 
on Iraq. Instead, the C.I.A. provided a narrower report, dealing specifically 
with Iraq's program to develop weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<P> Lawmakers said that Mr. Tenet had assured the committee in early September 
that intelligence officials were in the midst of producing an updated national 
intelligence estimate on Iraq, and that the committee would receive it as soon 
as it was completed. </p>
<P> Instead, the Senate panel received the national intelligence estimate on Iraq's 
weapons of mass destruction program after 10 p.m. on Tuesday night, too late for 
members to read it before Wednesday's hearing. </p>
<P> The committee had "set out an explicit set of requests" for what was to be 
included in the Iraq national intelligence estimate, said one official. Those 
requirements were not met. "We wanted to know what the intelligence community's 
assessment of the effect on a war in Iraq on neighboring states, and they did 
not answer that question," the official said.</p>
<P> A senior intelligence official said the 100-page report on Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction program was completed in three weeks under very tight Congressional 
deadlines, and the writing had to be coordinated with several agencies.</p>
