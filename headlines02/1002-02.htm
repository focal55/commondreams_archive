<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq -- It's as hard to find a good word about President Bush on the 
streets of this hot, dusty city as it is to find a bad word about TBG, The Big 
Guy, Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>TBG is used in conversations among Westerners so that Iraqis don't think their 
leader is being slandered when they hear his name mentioned. Most Iraqis aren't 
so discreet about America's Big Guy.</p>
<p>"You are from America?" asked a burly but good-humored cab-driver. "Welcome," 
he said, adding with a laugh, "Big Bush, Little Bush no good." </p>

</table></font>And with his English used up and his passengers' Arabic non-existent, he contented 
himself with pointing out and naming various hotels along the street, laughing 
again when he jabbed a thick finger toward the El Rasheed Hotel and with Arabic 
and hand motions described the entryway of the building where an enormous mosaic 
spread out on the khaki-colored floor shows Big Bush with a painful-looking grimace, 
created when George Bush was president and fresh from the Allied victory over 
Iraq in the Persian Gulf War.</p>
<p>With the threat of war growing day by day, however, levity is not the norm 
for most conversations.</p>
<p>"If the United States invades Iraq, from that time on, all Muslims will hate 
the non-Muslim world," said Fermal Abdul, a Malaysian businessman, in town to 
attend a conference. "I believe it will start a war between all Muslims and all 
non-Muslims."</p>
<p>Abdul, who said he had tried other religions, including Hindu, Christian and 
Buddhism, before converting to Islam 25 years ago, said he believed Muslims are 
the "most patient" of peoples.</p>
<p>"After the United States invaded Afghanistan there was great anger throughout 
the Muslim world," he said. "Now, if there is an attack on Iraq, the Muslim world 
will explode."</p>
<p>When it was mentioned that not all non-Muslims agreed with George W. Bush's 
plans to use force against Iraq, Abdul said it didn't matter.</p>
<p>"It is sad, but I think that all the Muslim people will see is that they are 
white-skinned," he said. "I pity the white foreigner who just wants to visit any 
Muslim country if Bush invades Iraq, because they could be killed."</p>
<p>The strong linkage between "the Muslim world" and Iraq is not one that would 
have been made just a few years ago. Iraq historically, has been a strongly secular 
society, culturally and politically. Christians, Jews and Muslims have lived side 
by side. </p>
<p>After the creation of Israel in 1948, and the subsequent expulsion of millions 
of Palestinians, the attitude began to change. The continuing conflict in the 
Middle East and 12 years of sanctions have dramatically eroded that secularism, 
according to U.N. officials here.</p>
<p>Today boys and girls are placed in separate schools, Christians can no longer 
give their children Christian names; they must use the Arabic version. More women 
are dressing in the traditional Muslim style. Alcohol can no longer be consumed 
in public places.</p>
<p>"The Iraqi government appears to be forming alliances with the more religious 
portions of society," said one U.N. official.</p>
<p>He blamed sanctions for initiating a chain reaction of poverty and desperation, 
which encourages people to seek spiritual guidance, which gives the Muslim clergy 
more power -- leading to a more strongly Islamic society.</p>
<p>"The sanctions are eroding one of the most secular societies in the Middle 
East," he said. "The sanctions actually may be fostering terrorism."</p>
<p>Not all the news from Baghdad these days, however, is negative.</p>
<p>UNICEF figures show that the malnutrition rate is declining, the vaccination 
rate is going up and there have been improvements in communications, agriculture 
and the electrical supply.</p>
<p>There have been almost no improvements on the education front. A few schools 
have more books and most schools now have desks. But 8,000 schools still need 
repairs and the construction of some 5,000 schools is needed to meet the demands 
of the population.</p>
<p>Teachers, who work in classrooms with up to 67 students, still earn only $3 
to $5 a month. And 90 to 95 percent of the people depend solely on the U.N. food 
supplied under the oil-for-food program..</p>
<p>Still, a U.N. official said, the dramatic decline in the economic and health 
conditions of the people has been "arrested," but not improved.</p>
<p>Another war, he said, could be "catastrophic" for the people of Iraq.</p>
<p><i>P-I foreign desk editor Larry Johnson and photographer Paul Kitagaki Jr. 
are in Iraq to report on the mood and conditions as the country is under threat 
of attack from the United States. They are among only a handful of Western journalists 
reporting from Iraq.</i>
