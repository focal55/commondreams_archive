<p> India's defense minister contested Pakistani claims the hostile neighbors are poised for war, as New Delhi prepared to respond to a hard-line speech by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Islamabad's decision to test another missile.</p>
<p>"We are not on the brink," defense minister George Fernandes said. "The fact is that troops are on the border, but to say that they are on the brink of war would not be proper."</p>
<p>Musharraf said in an address to the Pakistani nation late Monday that the tension between the two testy neighbors who have fought three wars since independence in 1947 "is at its height."</p>
<p>"The danger of war is not yet over," he said in his toughly worded speech, delivered as one million troops backed by aircraft, armor and artillery units massed on the border between the nuclear-armed neighbors</p>
<p>Fernandes also contested Musharraf's claim that all infiltration across the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, had ended.</p>
<p>"What (Musharraf) has said about the present situation is totally wrong (regarding cross-border militancy)," Fernandes told Star television.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I have intelligence reports which say ISI (the Pakistani military intelligence service) is planning more strikes in many parts of the country," Fernandes told Star television.</p>
<p>He added that jihad (holy war) fighters from Afghanistan had descended on Pakistan administered Kashmir in large numbers.</p>
<p>"We have information that the number of terrorists who are on the other side of borders, people who have fled from Afghanistan, people from al-Qaeda, Taliban, are in Pakistan occupied Kashmir," he said.</p>
<p>The Indian defense minister said there was "no question" of pulling back the troops from the border under the prevailing conditions.</p>
<p>Pakistan, meanwhile, ignored Tuesday international calls for restraint and tested another missile, a surface-to-surface Hatf-II with a range of 180 kilometers (111 miles) -- its third in four days.</p>
<p>"The whole thing is being done because of domestic compulsions. We remain unimpressed," Indian defense ministry spokesman P. K. Bandyopadhyay told AFP.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was due back in New Delhi Tuesday at the end of a brief holiday at his hill station home in Manali, for a meeting with his security chiefs over latest developments, officials said.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh was scheduled to give India's official reaction to Musharaff's statement later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>India's junior foreign minister Omar Abdullah gave a hint Monday night in a brief response to the general's speech of what line New Delhi is likely to take on Musharraf's speech.</p>
<p>"I think it is obviously going to make us very angry," Abdullah told Star television.</p>
<p>The heavy cross-border shelling between Indian and Pakistani troops which has become a feature of life in Kashmir for the past 12 days died down overnight Monday but resumed Tuesday morning, police said.</p>
<p>A spokesman said Pakistani troops had unleashed a barrage of more than 50 shells at Now Shera, in southern Kashmir. There was no immediate indication of casualties.</p>
