<p>Anti-war fever awoke over the weekend, as about 8,000 protesters in 
San Francisco joined brethren across the country in a rising rumble against 
President Bush's drive to disarm Iraq.

</table></font>In what was proclaimed a national day of resistance, voices that were never 
muted became full-throated, amplified by anger and apprehension over saber 
rattling against Saddam Hussein.
<P>"This is the beginning of a solid anti-war movement," said Osama Qasem, 32, 
president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who attended 
Sunday's demonstration at Union Square.
<P>"Now, there is an urgency to strengthen our movement, to say no to war," 
Qasem said. "It's high time to realize that exercising your right to freedom 
of expression does not make you un-American."
<P>Over the weekend, from the east meadow of New York's Central Park to the 
National Guard headquarters in Los Angeles, scores of thousands rallied 
against a possible war with Iraq. At the Texas state capitol, protesters 
shouted "No more blood for oil," while in Portland 5,000 people, some of them 
newly born pacifists, linked with veteran demonstrators to protest military 
intervention against Iraq.
<P>Organized by a seven-month-old, New York-based organization called Not In 
Our Name, more than two dozen other rallies were held in cities including 
Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Fresno and Minneapolis.

</table></font>Salt Lake City residents Carol Gnade and Lorraine Miller were certain their 
own town's rally would be bantam-sized compared to San Francisco's -- so they 
flew to the Bay Area in time for the protest.
<P>"Wouldn't miss this one," said Gnade. "I was so glad to finally have some 
place to come to vent our feelings. It's been frustrating reading how much 
support George Bush has for this war."
<P>Polls generally indicate support for military action against Iraq, believed 
by the Bush administration to have long been acquiring weapons of mass 
destruction, with a majority of people polled favoring multilateral backing 
through the United Nations.
<P>But in the Bay Area, with its heritage of political activism, many have 
begun expressing an uneasy foreboding.
<P>Galvanized by Bush's push for military intervention, anti-war sentiment re-
emerged Sunday into blazing sunshine and cacophony at Union Square.
<P>"Bush wants to go to war -- he's going to find a way no matter what," said 
Aimara, 28, a receptionist at an Oakland law firm and spokesperson for Not In 
Our Name. "We need to find a way to show that people aren't just going to sit 
down. I don't like Saddam. I think he's horrible. He doesn't care about the 
Iraqi people, but Bush doesn't care either. What he cares about is controlling 
the region."
<P>Not In Our Name's "pledge of resistance" was recited in assorted languages: 
<P>"We believe that as people living in the United States it is our responsibility 
to resist the injustices done by our government, in our names. .. . Another world 
is possible, and we pledge to make it real."

</table></font></font>The rally was endorsed by numerous groups including the Alameda County 
Peace and Justice Coalition, the Filipino Workers' Association, Global 
Exchange and Veterans for Peace.
<P>Some participants rode BART -- dubbed "the peace train" for the day -- into 
the city.
<P>Fittingly for the city's cornerstone of commerce, water was sold at the 
rally for $1 a bottle, buttons ("I love my country, it's the government I 
hate") went for $3.
<P>A warm-up protest was held at the foot of Powell Street by Global Exchange 
and the International Answer Coalition. Attended by several hundred protesters, 
their chants of "No blood for oil" could scarcely be heard amid the din of percussion 
instruments and Market Street denizens. 
<P>Watching bemusedly from the cable car queue was Chris Jacobsen, 19, a Coast 
Guard seaman apprentice visiting the city from Nebraska.
<P>"There's a generation gap going on here. I see a lot of old people who 
probably haven't been protesting since Vietnam," said Jacobsen, who supports 
military action in Iraq. "San Francisco has been liberal for so long, you 
expect to see demonstrations like this here. In Omaha, this would never fly."
