<p>MONTEREY, Calif.  - 
A U.S. Air Force officer has
been suspended from duty after he wrote a letter to a
California newspaper accusing President Bush of allowing the
Sept. 11 attacks to happen "because he needed this war on
terrorism," a military official said on Tuesday.
<p>

Lt. Colonel Steve Butler was relieved of his duties as vice
chancellor for student affairs at the Defense Language
Institute pending an investigation into his letter, which was
published in the Monterey County Herald on May 26, a military
spokesman said.
<p>
Butler's letter accused Bush -- the commander in chief of
the U.S. armed forces -- of allowing the Sept. 11 attacks to
occur for his own political ends.
<p>
"Of course Bush knew about the impending attacks on
America. He did nothing to warn the American people because he
needed this war on terrorism. His daddy had Saddam and he
needed Osama," Butler's letter said.
<p>
"His presidency was going nowhere. He wasn't elected by the
American people, but placed into the Oval Office by the
conservative Supreme Court...the economy was sliding into the
usual Republican pits and he needed something to hang his
presidency on."
<p>
Butler, a 24-year Air Force veteran who served as a combat
pilot during the 1990 Gulf War, was not immediately available
for comment.
<p>
His wife, Shelly Butler, told the Herald on Tuesday that
the military had given her husband "a lot of grief" over the
letter and reassigned him to temporary duty at Travis Air Force
Base in Fairfield, California.
<p>
She said he planned to retire in several weeks.
<p>
Butler's suspension was apparently based on Article 88 of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which says that any
commissioned officer who uses "contemptuous words" against the
president or other senior officials may be punished by a
court-martial.
<p>
The Monterey Herald said that the last Article 88
court-martial came in 1965 when an Army second lieutenant was
prosecuted for taking part in an anti-war protest in Texas,
although the Pentagon  had "quietly issued" memos reminding
officers of the Article 88 provisions after President Clinton became embroiled in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, prompting a
number of articles and letters to the editor from military
officers.
