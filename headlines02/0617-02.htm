</table>Yet those two traits have brought federal prosecutors to his doorstep threatening 
to put him in jail for up to 12 years for aiding an enemy of the United States. 
Sacks, a retired engineer, admits it's a strange position for someone who embraces 
non-violence and it's why he has come to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Today is the deadline for Sacks to pay a $10,000 fine for violating economic 
sanctions against Iraq. The violation is connected to a 1997 trip Sacks took to 
Iraq in which he has acknowledged taking $40,000 worth of medicine.</p>
<p>While the government is pursuing him on that single event, Sacks has made eight 
trips to Iraq over the last six years, taking medicine, including antibiotics 
and vitamins, each time in an attempt to ease what he believes is untenable suffering 
for Iraqi children and to draw attention to what he claims are illegal sanctions.</p>
<p>He has accompanied and/or helped arrange trips to Iraq for several groups, 
including the <a href="http://www.wpsr.org/" target="_new">Washington Physicians 
for Social Responsibility</a> and <a href="http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw/" target="_new">Voices 
in the Wilderness</a>, a Chicago-based organization.</p>
<p>Mild mannered as he is, Sacks is steadfast in his opposition to the sanctions 
that have been in place for 12 years. He refuses to pay the fine and is willing 
to face the consequences.</p>
<p>"We should speak in clear English," he says. "It's killing 5,000 children a 
month. It's not honest; it's not accurate to say it penalizes the Iraqi people. 
It kills them. I've been to Auschwitz, I'm Jewish. Nobody would say Auschwitz 
created hardships for the Jewish people. We need to be honest."</p>
<p>So Sacks and a rapidly growing number of supporters and other groups across 
the country continue to go to Iraq. And he has come to Washington with other activists 
in an attempt to persuade the government to rethink its position.</p>
<p>"It is very clear that U.S. policy of bombing civilian infrastructure and 11 
years of sanctions is knowingly causing suffering and death, deliberately causing 
suffering and death of Iraqi civilians in order to coerce the government of Iraq. 
And that's wrong.</p>
<p>"If you're doing something very wrong ... you need to stop doing what's wrong. 
So we need to stop the economic sanctions and let the country rebuild," Sacks 
says.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
which is responsible for enforcing the economic provisions, refused to comment 
about Sacks' case. But he reiterated the U.S. government's determination to maintain 
the sanctions.</p>
<p>Sacks' mission is one that few in America have noticed. Polls show a combination 
of indifference for foreign affairs and support for toppling Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein. The desire to depose Saddam has grown strong since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
</p>
<p>Sacks, however, presses on, sustained by the belief that if American people 
understood what the sanctions were doing in Iraq there would be strong public 
pressure to change the policy.</p>
<p>"If that truth gets out, then there's a chance for change," he says.</p>
<p>And along with trying to educate the public, Sacks goes to Iraq to help -- 
in a small way -- relieve the suffering of children.</p>
<p>The sanctions, combined with destruction of Iraq's water systems, electrical 
grid and other infrastructure during the Gulf War, causes more than 5,000 children 
to die each month, Sacks says in explaining why he is risking jail.</p>
<p>"I go to Iraq; I've been warned, and I keep doing it because kids keep dying. 
We can't figure out what better to do. There's no better course," he said.</p>
<p>"We've put into place a policy that we know is deadly. We're doing it to coerce, 
and that's a crime even on our books."</p>
<p>Sacks doesn't object to all sanctions. He says he supports a military embargo 
of Iraq and even economic sanctions if they are carefully crafted. But the current 
sanctions, he says, are not achieving the goal of destabilizing Saddam or stopping 
the development of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>"People who put the policies in place say we're being tough on Saddam. It's 
not true. We're killing children," he says. "They are keeping medicine out of 
the hands of people and if I were to go request permission from a law that I view 
is immoral and illegal, then I'm complicit in the crime. And this is a crime."</p>
<p>Despite Sacks' persistence, the sanctions aren't likely to end soon.</p>
<p>The United States remains firmly committed to the blockade, believing that 
sanctions are the best way to force political change in Iraq. That position has 
held strong through three presidents.</p>
<p>The United Nations imposed the economic sanctions on Iraq on Aug. 6, 1990, 
in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The United States government also has imposed sanctions on Iraq. Under those 
sanctions, it is illegal to take any aid into Iraq without government approval, 
a violation punishable by stiff fines and jail time.</p>
<p>The U.S. government says the sanctions must remain in place until Iraq has 
proven that it has given up its weapons of mass destruction. Other countries, 
including France, Russia and China, oppose the sanctions. </p>
<p>U.S. officials say Iraq's refusal to comply is to blame for the country's economic 
collapse, which has degraded health and education in Iraq and left many of its 
citizens dependent on U.N. food rations. </p>
<p>However, U.S. officials agree that some changes are needed to help relieve 
suffering of Iraqi citizens. Last month, for example, the U.S. agreed to a proposal 
by the U.N. Security Council to loosen the embargo to allow Iraq to trade oil 
for food and medicine.</p>
<p>The resolution adopted by the council extended the U.N. oil-for-food program 
for 180 days -- until Nov. 25. The resolution allows the free flow of most civilian 
goods into Iraq while simultaneously using a 332-page checklist to address concerns 
by the United States and other council members that Iraq diverts civilian goods 
to military use. </p>
<p>Critics say that the sanctions have crippled Iraq's people while doing nothing 
to weaken Saddam's power. They cite a 1999 report by the United Nations Children's 
Fund that the sanctions caused the deaths of as many as 500,000 Iraqi children 
under age 5 from 1991 to 1998. </p>
<p>They also cite a study by the Harvard University School of Public Health: Two 
months after the war, representatives from the school found that the destruction 
of the country's power plants had halted its entire system of water purification 
and distribution, leading to epidemics of cholera and typhoid fever, among other 
diseases. </p>
<p>Sacks admits he isn't sure what will happen with his case, though he is certain 
that the American government will one day realize the sanctions must be changed.</p>
<p>"There is some part of me that has fear; that I can find myself in this situation 
by continuing to challenge my government," he said. "I can get thrown in jail 
for 12 years.</p>
<p>"There's another part of me that feels very good, that I'm finally walking 
a certain walk."</p>
