<p>The Government's attempt to present Iraq as a uniquely evil regime turned into 
a public relations flop yesterday when the Iraqi dissident chosen to present it 
denounced the threat of war with Saddam Hussein and said Baghdad officials used 
British-made equipment as instruments of torture</p>
<p class="story">Amnesty International accused the Government of turning a blind 
eye to human rights abuses elsewhere in the world and seizing on the horrors in 
Iraq for political reasons.</p>
<p class="story">Hussain al-Shahristani, a former nuclear scientist who was tortured 
and jailed for 11 years for refusing to work on Saddam's secret nuclear programme, 
said: "When I was in jail I was held with British-made handcuffs. In the cells 
next door, I could hear the screams of people who were having holes drilled into 
their bones. Those drills were made in Britain."</p>
<p class="story">The Foreign Office's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;$sessionid$Z5VG2PR1YMN4ZQFIQMFCFFWAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2002/12/02/wirq202.xml" target="_new" lang="en.uk">23-page 
report</a> is drawn mainly from open sources, such as reports by Amnesty and Human 
Rights Watch, with a sprinkling of newer information from the Government.</p>
<p class="story">Officials said that, despite the horrors it catalogues, no decision 
had been taken on whether to create a Yugoslavia-style war crimes tribunal for 
Iraqi atrocities.</p>
<p class="story">"This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold 
and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists," said Irene 
Khan, Amnesty's secretary general.</p>
<p class="story">"Let us not forget that these same governments turned a blind 
eye to Amnesty's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before 
the Gulf war."</p>
<p class="story">At a briefing for journalists, the Foreign Office projected a 
video montage depicting Iraqi detainees being beaten and executed, and of the 
aftermath of the Iraqi gas attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja in 1988.</p>
<p class="story">Mr al-Shahristani quickly strayed from the script. He nodded 
approvingly when Foreign Office officials were confronted with a barrage of questions 
about Britain's silence at the time of the Halabja massacre, its support for Iraq 
in the 1980s and accusations that the Government was trying to build a case for 
war.</p>
<p class="story">He rejected the idea of another conflict: "I am extremely concerned 
about the consequences of this intervention on the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="story">"I am particularly concerned that weapons of mass destruction 
could be used again by the Iraqi regime against the people if there should be 
any opposition or uprising." He added: "The Iraqi people could pay the price of 
this war, as they have paid the price of sanctions and all the previous wars."</p>
<p class="story">The Government dossier lists several methods of torture, including 
eye gouging, piercing of hands with electric drills, suspension from the ceiling, 
electric shock, sexual abuse, beating the soles of the feet, mock executions and 
acid baths. The report says: "Fear is Saddam's chosen method for staying in power."</p>
<p class="story">Some of the cases highlighted include:</p>
<li><span class="listory">A husband and wife were tortured separately about the 
sale of a car which, investigators claimed, had been seized during a raid on Iraqi 
opposition activists. The woman was stripped, burnt with a lit cigarette and beaten 
while her children were forced to watch. Her husband's arms were tied behind his 
back and he was suspended from a hook. Later, he was shot at with a pistol and 
his feet and hands were mutilated with gunshots. Eventually the family paid a 
bribe and the couple was released and managed to flee the country.</span></li>
<p class="story"></p>
<li><span class="listory">Saddam's son, Uday, maintains "a private torture chamber" 
in Baghdad, and "personally executed dissidents in Basra" during the 1991 uprising. 
He also "ordered the national football team to be caned on the soles of their 
feet after losing a World Cup qualifying match".</span></li>
<p class="story"></p>
<li><span class="listory">Women are routinely beheaded on charges of prostitution. 
The identity card of one Iraqi militiaman, Aziz Salih Ahmed, is reproduced and 
describes his occupation as "violation of women's honour", that is, a professional 
rapist.</span></li>
<p class="story"></p>
<li><span class="listory">Horrendous prison conditions, such as the "Casket Prison" 
in Baghdad, where "prisoners are kept in rows of steel boxes, as found in mortuaries, 
until they either confess to their crimes or die. There are around 100-150 boxes, 
which are opened for half an hour a day to allow the prisoners some light and 
air".</span></li>
<p class="story"></p>
<li><span class="listory">A commander's letter chastising a subordinate, saying: 
"There is no objection to cutting off the heads of traitors. But it would have 
been preferable had you also sent them to security for the purpose of interrogating 
them."</span></li>
<p class="story"></p>
<li><span class="listory">A decree passed in 2000 allowing the amputation of the 
tongue as a penalty for insulting the president or his family.</span></li>
