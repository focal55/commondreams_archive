TEL AVIV --
This weekend's U.S.-brokered deal to lift the confinement of 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was a bitter pill for Israel, but President 
Bush made it easier to swallow by pledging American aid in managing a U.N. 
investigation of the Jenin incident, it was confirmed yesterday.

speaking to his Cabinet</b></font></div>

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had insisted that Arafat hand over six 
militants holed up with him in his Ramallah compound or face an indefinite 
blockade of the building.
<P>But Bush and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice were able to break 
the logjam by promising to support Israel in the Jenin matter while enlisting 
Britain to provide monitors who will work beside American counterparts in 
overseeing the future imprisonment of the Palestinian militants.
<P>Neither side has openly acknowledged that such a deal was made, but reports 
in the Israeli media and statements by Israeli cabinet officials yesterday 
made clear that a quid pro quo had been struck.
<P>Sources in Sharon's office said yesterday that Rice and Sharon foreign 
policy adviser Danny Ayalon had been in "constant connection" during Sunday's 
cantankerous, all-day session of the Israeli Cabinet, many of whose members 
opposed giving Arafat freedom of movement.
<P>After Ayalon apprised Rice of the resistance, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper 
reported, Rice ultimately asked him to convey a personal message from Bush to 
Sharon that the United States "will be with you the entire way."
<P>This was understood as a reference to Israel's increasingly heated 
confrontation with the United Nations over a committee charged with looking 
into Israeli actions during eight days battling Palestinian gunmen in a Jenin 
refugee camp. Dozens are believed to have died in the fighting.
<P>"We have to do this because Bush has offered help with the Jenin fact-
finding team affair," Sharon told the Cabinet at one point, finally winning 
them over on a 17-to-9 vote.
<P>To sweeten the pot, Rice also delivered an invitation from Bush to Sharon 
asking the Israeli leader to visit in Washington next week.
<P>Transportation Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel Radio yesterday: "How can 
we turn down an offer from the Americans? The battle is now moving to the 
diplomatic arena, and in this arena our greatest asset is U.S. support."
<P><b>BACKING DOWN BY SHARON?</b>
<P>Despite the diplomatic cover offered by Bush and Rice, however, many 
Israelis interpret the affair as a backing down by Sharon.
<P>"There was very, very heavy pressure on Sharon, personal pressure applied 
by Bush," said diplomatic commentator Akiva Eldar. "The pressure is also 
connected to Bush's meeting last Friday with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. 
Lifting the siege on Arafat was one of the things that Bush promised to the 
Saudis."
<P>Indeed, Sharon had told Secretary of State Colin Powell only two weeks ago 
that he would "rather go to elections" than let the six people in Arafat's 
compound go free.
<P>The six are the four killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, a 
personal friend of Sharon's, as well as Ahmed Saadat, the leader of the 
militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- whom Israel accuses 
of organizing and executing dozens of terrorist attacks -- and Palestinian 
Authority finance chief Fuad Shubaki, believed by Israel to have orchestrated 
the Karine A weapons-smuggling affair.
<P>Arafat carried out a trial last week in which the six were all found guilty 
and given sentences ranging from one to 18 years.
<P>Israel quickly denounced the proceeding as a farce, noting that 
Palestinians are often convicted and imprisoned only to be released a few days 
or weeks later. Successive U.S. administrations have spoken disparagingly of 
Arafat's "revolving door" policy toward justice for militants.
<P><b>SOME UNHAPPY WITH DEAL</b>
<P>Many Palestinians were not enthusiastic about the deal springing Arafat.
<P>"If these four people killed the minister, then yes, they should go to 
prison," said Sameer Abdullah, a bank executive in Ramallah. "But Ahmed Saadat 
(the PFLP leader) is very popular here in Ramallah, and people are very angry 
that he will have to go to prison. People are saying that he is someone who is 
a fighter and who simply has fought for his political ideals, and they do not 
want him to go."
<P>A team of British experts arrived yesterday to ascertain how many and what 
kind of monitors should be put in place. But by late in the day, no decisions 
had been reached, and Arafat remained in his compound.
<P>"We don't know if these people monitoring the prisoners will be American 
policemen or soldiers," said Paul Patton, the press attache at the U.S. 
Embassy in Tel Aviv.
<P>"The British have a lot of experience with this type of thing in Northern 
Ireland, and so they'll be able to bring that experience to this situation," 
he added. "We think we have achieved a lot by ending this standoff, and we 
hope we'll be able to get Bethlehem cleared next."
<P>There is a precedent for such a force: In 1975, Henry Kissinger's efforts 
to defuse disputes between Israel and Egypt led to an American "Sinai field 
contingent." It operated for just a few weeks.
<P>Analysts say those who see the British and U.S. monitors as the precursors 
for a permanent peacekeeping force in the region are mistaken.
