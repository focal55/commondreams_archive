<p>The small conference room of Kerckhoff Hall exploded with thunderous applause

condemning a U.S. attack against Iraq.

</table></font>The resolution was approved with a 5-0-5 vote. All five Undergraduate Students 
Association Council members from the Student Empowerment! slate voted in favor 
of the resolution. The other council members abstained from voting. 
<p> More than 50 students from various student groups stormed the USAC general 
meeting to present the council with reasons to oppose the war. The resolution 
was sponsored by Academics Affairs Commissioner Chris Diaz, Internal Vice President 
T.J. Cordero and Cultural Affairs Commissioner Robbie Clark. 
<p> Samahang Pilipino President Emerson Lego told the council about the nation&#039;s 
long-standing history of students taking stances on political issues. From civil 
rights to the Vietnam War to the apartheid issue, students have made a difference, 
Lego said. 
<p> &#034;Students should utilize the resources they have to benefit all of humanity,&#034; 
he said. 
<p> Fourth-year student Sophia Kozak added that the resolution received support 
from 15 different student organizations, and is representative of student needs. 
More than 700 students signed a petition against a possible war. 
<p> The overwhelming presence of anti-war sentiment was contended by one meeting-goer. 
<p> Bruin Republican President Andy Jones, a former Daily Bruin Viewpoint columnist, 
argued that from what he has observed, most students are in favor of the war or 
don&#039;t know the facts. 
<p> He added that USAC had no place to make any sort of policy regarding the issue. 
<p> &#034;This is not our fight ... it is the fight of the international councils,&#034; 
he said. 
<p> But peace proponent Eric Tang said that it was students&#039; responsibility 
to get involved. 
<p> Fifth-year business economics and international development studies student 
Ghaith Mahmood, who has family in Iraq, encouraged USAC to make the connection 
between the war and students. 
<p> A war would result in increased military spending causing budget cuts in education, 
health care and labor, Mahmood said. 
<p> Following the vote of approval, student group members, anti-war posters in 
hand, continued their celebration out on the Kerckhoff stairs applauding council 
and chanting calls for peace. 
<p> Council members were split on whether the student government made the right 
decision. 
<p> General Representative Adam Harmetz said he abstained from voting because 
he didn&#039;t know how all undergraduate students felt. 
<p> &#034;I didn&#039;t want my personal views to get in the way,&#034; he said. 
<p> General Representative Jenny Lam said although she was satisfied with the 
outcome, she wished more council members would have voted. 
<p> &#034;A lot of students on campus have concerns and abstaining to vote is 
like choosing to not voice those concerns,&#034; Lam said. 
<p> Some students expressed different views on the issue. 
<p> &#034;I think we shouldn&#039;t go to war, it just causes more hate and pain,&#034; 
said first-year business economics student Laura Lin. 
<p> But fourth-year psychology student Jason Drew said that he didn&#039;t know 
enough about the issue to take a stance. 
<p> Both council members and students had varied opinions on whether student government 
should take official stances of political issues. 
<p> Harmetz said he felt that generally USAC should not take political stances, 
but the Iraq issue is justified. 
<p> &#034;We need to be very careful because (USAC taking) political stances could 
marginalize students,&#034; he said. 
<p> President David Dahle added that student council should use caution when taking 
political stances and base its decision on sufficient evidence from the student 
body. 
<p> &#034;I do believe that the (student government) should take a stance ... 
war and violence are issues that divide and affect students,&#034; said Hadley 
Salz, fifth-year world arts and culture student. 
<p> &#034;If (USAC) takes an anti-war stance, it would be encouraging peace,&#034; 
Salz said. 
<p> Fourth-year political science and history student, Eric Haren said he felt 
student government had no place commenting on matters of foreign policy. 
<p> Haren added that students aren&#039;t generally interested in USAC decisions 
in the first place. 
<p> &#034;You can look at USAC voter turnout and see that students don&#039;t 
care what USAC does,&#034; he said. 
<p> In the past, USAC councils have set precedents for both sides of the issue. 
Councils have both taken political stances as well as opting to refrain from passing 
such resolutions. 
<p> In 2001, the council voted 10-0 to withdraw a resolution condemning the Israeli 
government for alleged violations of Palestinians&#039; human rights. 
<p> In the 1980s, student government passed a resolution urging the University 
of California Regents to divest from South Africa in protest of apartheid.</p>
