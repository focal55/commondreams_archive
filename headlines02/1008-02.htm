<p>The worst came just as the residents of Al-Katiba thought they were safe. A 
little before 4am yesterday, hundreds of Palestinians spilled on to the streets 
to check on their neighbors and vent their anger as dozens of Israeli tanks withdrew 
after a grueling three-hour raid on the Gaza strip. 
<P>Ghada al-Farra watched from her balcony as her husband and 10-year-old son 
Fawzi joined the throng.</P>
<P>"I was holding my daughter in my arms looking over the balcony," she said. 
"I saw something in the sky, fire in the sky. I was about to shout to my husband 
but in a fraction of a second there was an explosion. Everything was smashed. 
My son was lying there crying 'Papa, I don't want to die'."</P>
<P>Fawzi survived with shrapnel wounds to a leg and both arms. But at least 10 
people did die, including a 15-year-old boy and a middle-aged woman, and about 
130 were wounded after an Israeli helicopter fired a missile into the crowd of 
several hundred people.</P>
<P>Two of the dead and 22 of the injured were from a single family, the al-Astals.</P>

Thousands of Palestinians parade the bodies of those killed during a mass funeral 
after an Israeli incursion in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Monday, Oct. 7, 
2002. Twelve Palestinians were killed and over 100 wounded early Monday during 
an Israeli incursion into the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, officials and 
doctors said, most when an Israeli helicopter fired a missile that exploded in 
a crowd. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra) <br>

</table></font>More bloodshed followed. Altogether 14 people died in the Israeli raid on the 
Khan Yunis district of southern Gaza, a Hamas stronghold which includes Al-Katiba. 
Another was killed and three were injured when the Israeli army opened fire on 
the hospital where many of the wounded from the night's attacks were taken.</P>
<P>The Israeli military claimed that someone "in the vicinity" had fired mortars 
at a nearby Jewish settlement.</P>
<P>And then Palestinians began killing Palestinians. Later in the morning, the 
head of Gaza's riot police, Colonel Rajeh Abu Lehiya, was abducted and shot, apparently 
in revenge for his role in the killing of three students during an anti-US demonstration 
a year ago. A brother of one of the students killed by the riot police, Raed Akel, 
claimed responsibility for the killing.</P>
<P>The colonel's murder provoked a bout of fighting between the Palestinian police 
and Hamas that left at least two more people dead.</P>
<P>The Israeli army said it launched the raid on Khan Yunis shortly after midnight 
to "disrupt Hamas activities in the area". In Al-Katiba, residents say they were 
forced to lie on the floors of their homes for more than two hours under Israeli 
guard, and forbidden even to go to the toilet.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Israel Ziff, the army commander in the area, said he gave 
orders to minimize civilian casualties but his men were forced to fight their 
way out of the area under heavy Palestinian attack and the helicopter was called 
in to protect his forces.</P>
<P>"They fired a lot and threw grenades. There was a battle there. The helicopter 
aimed at this armed group and hit them," he said.</P>
<P>Palestinians do not deny there were men with guns in the crowd but claim the 
only shooting was in the air in celebration at the Israeli withdrawal, and the 
lack of Israeli casualties proves the army was not under attack.</P>
<P>Whatever the truth, the helicopter fired a missile that exploded a few feet 
above the ground in front of Fatima al-Astal's home. Her 17-year-old son, Ahmad, 
was killed. His 10-year-old sister, Yusra, and adult brother, Mahmoud, were hit 
by shrapnel. Yusra was injured in the leg. A 15-year-old cousin was lying across 
the hospital ward from her. Both were in great pain.</P>
<P>"There were helicopters flying all night so we weren't surprised to hear one," 
said Mahmoud al-Astal after a doctor treated shrapnel wounds across his neck and 
back. "Suddenly there was this explosion. No one expected it or we would have 
run for cover. We would not have wanted the children there."</P>
<P>At Naser hospital, Haider al-Kedra, a surgeon, said a flood of casualties descended 
shortly after he heard the missile explode.</P>
<P>"We heard a huge explosion. Minutes later all these casualties appeared. They 
came three or four to an ambulance, in taxis, in private cars. We had to clear 
the gynecological unit to make room," he said.</P>
<P>Of the 101 admitted to the hospital, nearly one-third needed emergency surgery. 
Among the injured was a 70-year-old woman and, the hospital authorities say, about 
a dozen children.</P>
<P>At funerals a few hours later for several of the victims - "martyrs" as they 
are invariably called by the Palestinians - the green flags of Hamas and white 
banners of the al-Aqsa suicide bombers were on prominent display.</P>
<P>Hamas responded to the attack on the heart of its volatile stronghold by vowing 
to avenge the deaths of civilians "by the killing of civilians."</P>
<P>"The response for today's massacre will come in the shape of escalating resistance 
and strikes everywhere in the land of Palestine," Mahmoud al-Zahar, a senior member 
of Hamas, said. Another Hamas leader, Abed al Aziz Rantisi, called on supporters 
to "kill every Zionist".</p>
