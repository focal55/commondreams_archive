<p>RELATIONS between the United States and Saudi Arabia have deteriorated so far 
that the Saudi Arabians are no longer considered allies, senior diplomatic sources 
said yesterday. 
<P>Saudi Arabia, once the indispensable cornerstone of US policy in the Arab world, 
has refused to co-operate with the war on terrorism or support President Bush’s 
plans to overthrow President Saddam Hussein. According to the sources, it has 
handed over no Intelligence of any value about the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, 
which has roots in Saudi Arabia. 
<P>The final “stab in the back” for Washington was the decision to ban American 
bombers from attacking Iraq from Saudi airbases. That has soured relations to 
such an extent that the country from which America launched its 1991 invasion 
of Iraq is now being excluded from discussions about a post-Saddam era. 
<P>Even Syria, which in public is opposed to an attack on Iraq and has been engaged 
in trade and arms deals with Baghdad, is talking secretly to the Americans and 
the British about the role that Damascus may play in the region if Saddam is overthrown. 
A Syrian delegation is understood to have had discussions with British officials 
in London this week. 
<P>British diplomatic sources said that the Saudi ruling elite was immersed in 
a “dynastic battle” and was so concerned about survival that the key figures were 
afraid of taking any decision that would be interpreted by the people as being 
pro-Western and anti-Arab. It had become increasingly difficult to find anyone 
with sufficient clout and influence in Riyadh “to talk about anything”. 
<P>King Fahd, 79, is said by Gulf-based diplomats to be suffering increasing ill 
health, giving rise to speculation about his successor. He left Geneva for his 
holiday home in Spain yesterday after undergoing eye surgery. 
<P>General Tommy Franks, the US Central Command chief who is planning the campaign 
against Iraq, is understood to have removed from his list of potential launch 
pads the huge Prince Sultan airbase, 50 miles south of Riyadh, which the allies 
used as their combined air operations center in the Gulf War. Development work 
at General Franks’s alternative “war base” — the al-Udeid site in Qatar — was 
now so far advanced that it would soon be a “totally self-sufficient” American 
facility, the sources said. 
<P>“There may be no political decision yet, but militarily the US has made enough 
preparations to attack Iraq any time, without using any facilities in Saudi Arabia, 
other than Saudi airspace. It is assumed that the Saudis would not go as far as 
denying over-flight rights,” the sources said. 
<P>Saudi Arabia’s failure to reveal any useful Intelligence about al-Qaeda has 
been in marked contrast to the co- operation of countries such as Yemen. 
<P>Despite arresting 13 al-Qaeda suspects several months ago, the Saudi authorities 
have not divulged to the Americans any material that could help Western intelligence 
agencies to unravel the network, the sources said. 
<P>Sixteen Saudi al-Qaeda suspects detained by Iran after crossing from Afghanistan 
had also been handed over to Saudi Arabia. Riyadh has promised that any Intelligence 
gleaned from the suspects would be passed to the US. 
<P>However, the sources said: “All the Saudis are interested in is getting information 
from suspect al-Qaeda terrorists which relates only to Saudi Arabia’s security. 
They have not been at all co-operative in seeking answers from suspects which 
might have some bearing on the international threat posed by al-Qaeda.” 
<P>The hierarchy in Saudi Arabia had been “taken by surprise” by the September 
11 attacks in America, carried out by 19 hijackers of whom 15 were believed to 
have been Saudi citizens. Many of the al-Qaeda suspects arrested in Afghanistan 
and taken to the American interrogation camp at Guantanamo Bay were also Saudis. 
<P>Saudi Arabia had also been “deeply involved” with Pakistan in funding the Taliban 
in Afghanistan, and had financed the “Salafi” Islamic ideological schools in Pakistan 
at which many Taliban and al-Qaeda fundamentalists had developed their hatred 
of the West. 
<P>Relations with Saudi Arabia were now so poor that there was at present only 
one issue that could be seen in a positive light, and that was oil. The Saudis 
supply 17 per cent of America’s oil needs. 
<P>“In all other key areas, the Saudis are not being obliging, so in planning 
for Iraq the Americans have turned to Gulf states they see as real allies, such 
as Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain,” the sources said. Britain’s relations with 
Saudi Arabia have been complicated by the detention of five Britons, found guilty 
of mounting a bombing campaign in a bootlegging war. The British prisoners allege 
that they were tortured to make false confessions. 
<P>Two emissaries have been sent this year to Riyadh to raise the case with the 
Saudis. However, the Saudis have shown little interest in discussing what is seen 
in the Foreign Office as a case of trumped-up charges.</p>
