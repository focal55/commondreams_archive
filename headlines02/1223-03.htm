<p>From the tropics to the poles, evidence is growing stronger than ever that 
Earth's climate is warming dangerously. <P>In the Arctic Ocean, floating masses 
of sea ice are shrinking and splitting apart, and the massive Greenland ice cap 
melted more this past summer than ever before. Meanwhile, warming ocean temperatures 
are endangering coral reefs in the tropics. <P>At the annual fall meeting of the 
American Geophysical Union in San Francisco earlier this month, a flurry of new 
reports examining evidence of global climate change all tell the same story. <P>If 
the trends continue unchecked, scientists say, rising sea levels will drown coastlines. 
Droughts in some regions -- and increased rainfall in others -- will alter harvests 
drastically. And other climate disruptions will destabilize regional ecologies 
and global economies. <P>Some of these alarming phenomena may be due to the natural 
climate variability that the planet has seen over millions of years. But most 
scientists agree, after years of debate, that humans and their addiction to fossil 
fuels are at least partly to blame. <P>"It is humans who are clearly forcing the 
abrupt climate change we see right now," said Richard B. Alley of Pennsylvania 
State University, who recently chaired a National Research Council committee looking 
specifically at climate change. <P>So-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's radiation 
much the way glass windows trap heat inside a home or a greenhouse. The most powerful 
of those gases is carbon dioxide, which comes primarily from burning fossil fuel, 
while other gases include methane, sulfur dioxide and ozone. <P><b>THE BUSH REPORT</b> 
<P>A recent NRC report, which the Bush administration requested last year when 
scientists criticized the White House for its slow response to growing evidence 
of global warming, concluded that "human-induced warming" will continue through 
the 21st century. <P>While it conceded great uncertainties in the many models 
of climate trends that experts have produced, the report predicted that the planet's 
climate would warm by 2.5 to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the century's end due 
to human activity. <P>Signs of the striking pace of that trend came in reports 
from many scientists who monitor the ice of the globe's far north. <P>The Arctic's 
sea ice -- large masses of snow-covered ice that float everywhere around the polar 
latitudes -- usually covers 2.4 million square miles of the ocean north of Canada, 
Greenland and Russia in September, the height of the ice season. <P>This past 
summer, however, measurements showed that the sea ice had decreased by nearly 
a half-million square miles. The flat ice floes left wider sections of open water 
between them and became extremely thin in many areas, reported Ted Scambos of 
the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. <P>It marked the most 
abrupt change in the ocean's ice cover that scientists monitoring the region have 
seen in 24 years, said Mark Serreze of the data center. Records kept by Icelandic 
fishermen indicate the cover may not have been so low for centuries. <P>"I was 
really surprised by the change," Serreze said. "This was the craziest summer season 
I've ever seen up there." <P><b>MELTING FASTER THAN EVER</b> <P>Equally ominous 
was a report by Konrad Steffen, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado, 
on Greenland's vast ice cover, second only in size to Antarctica. It was melting 
faster this year across nearly 265,000 square miles than at any period in recorded 
history, Steffen said. <P>The ice sheet is a mile and a half thick in some places. 
As meltwater from the surface seeps through crevices in the ice, it loosens the 
edges of the sheet and causes the ice to flow more swiftly to the sea, where it 
breaks off into icebergs. <P>If the entire Greenland ice sheet were to completely 
melt -- admittedly an unlikely event, at least in the near future -- then scientists 
calculate that sea levels would rise by a globally disastrous 23 feet. <P>Steffen 
had a firsthand experience of the dangers of melting ice. He and his colleagues 
were camped on the normally hard-frozen Greenland ice last June when their camp 
and equipment were flooded under a foot of meltwater and they had to be rescued 
by helicopter. <P>The high Arctic is by no means the only part of the world where 
climate change is becoming more dramatic. Scientists are equally concerned about 
the impact of changes on tropical oceans. <P><b>KILLING CORAL</b> <P>Coral reefs 
are living creatures. As they die, their calcite skeletons build up the reefs 
over millions of years. They are a crucial part of the world's marine ecosystems, 
vital to the productivity of many tropical fisheries. <P>Most reefs are in shallow 
waters near continental and island coasts, where human-caused destruction is widespread 
from coastal pollution, from tourists trampling the reef organisms, from fishermen 
ravaging them, and from the hulls of ships grinding over them. <P>But five years 
ago, the corals in many parts of the world were afflicted by a mysterious episode 
of bleaching that slowed their growth and in many regions killed them outright. 
Researchers note that the bleaching has coincided with increasing ocean temperatures. 
<P>"There is growing agreement that doubling of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
means a 15 percent decline in the coral population," said Robert W. Buddemeier, 
a senior chemist with the Kansas Geological Survey, who has studied the impact 
of climate change on coral reefs. <P>"By the end of the century, with the effects 
of increasing levels of carbon dioxide on temperature and on ocean chemistry, 
the corals will be in the worst shape we've seen in the past 50 million years. 
Things are really dicey," he added. <P><b>NO TOUGH MEASURES</b> <P>The growing 
evidence of damage from climate change has goaded the Bush administration to push 
its own research program, although the president does not support any tough measures 
to control greenhouse gas emissions, including the Kyoto Protocol agreed to by 
most industrialized nations. <P>Earlier this month, Assistant Secretary of Commerce 
James Mahoney, an atmospheric physicist who is Bush's point man on global warming, 
staged a "workshop" in Washington where 1,500 people from industry, government, 
academic and environmental organizations worked on plans for a "strategy for climate 
change research." <P>"There are still any number of science questions to be resolved," 
Mahoney told reporters at the AGU meeting in San Francisco. He conceded, however, 
that already "we will most likely need profound changes in greenhouse gas emissions. 
" <P>But to many analysts, time is wasting. Global warming will cause "major political 
instabilities in the developing world that could disrupt the global economy," 
said Lester R. Brown, founder of the Earth Policy Institute and a noted environmental 
analyst who spent 10 years as a policy adviser in the Department of Agriculture. 
<P><b>FOOD SUPPLY IMPACT</b> <P>If measures aren't taken soon to curb greenhouse 
gas emissions, the changes in climate will force rapid changes in the way the 
world's food crops are grown. That has important implications for feeding the 
world's growing population, expected to increase to at least 9 billion by 2050. 
<P>"The vast corn belt of the Northern Hemisphere, for example, will become hotter 
and dryer, and that change can't be resolved merely by creating new corn belts 
further north, because the soils further north are not the same at all," Brown 
said. <P>"Each global increase of 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) around 
the world will reduce grain yields like rice and wheat, as well as corn, by at 
least 10 percent," he said. <P>And because aquifers are being tapped at an increasing 
pace throughout the world and water tables are falling, the outcome will soon 
mean a devastating blow to agriculture -- particularly in the developing world, 
he said. <P>"This disruption by a combination of climate change and water shortages 
has the potential for creating political instabilities on a scale that we can't 
even foresee," Brown declared.<p align="center">&copy;2002 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
