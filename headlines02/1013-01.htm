            <p>With the war on terror already a year old and the possibility of 
              war against Iraq growing by the day, a modern version of an ancient 
              practice — one as old as warfare itself — is reasserting itself 
              at the Pentagon. Mercenaries, as they were once known, are thriving 
              — only this time they are called private military contractors, and 
              some are even subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
            <P> The Pentagon cannot go to war without them.</p>
            <P> Often run by retired military officers, including three- and four-star 
              generals, private military contractors are the new business face 
              of war. Blurring the line between military and civilian, they provide 
              stand-ins for active soldiers in everything from logistical support 
              to battlefield training and military advice at home and abroad.</p>

</table>Some are helping to conduct training exercises using live ammunition 
              for American troops in Kuwait, under the code name Desert Spring. 
              One has just been hired to guard President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, 
              the target of a recent assassination attempt. Another is helping 
              to write the book on airport security. Others have employees who 
              don their old uniforms to work under contract as military recruiters 
              and instructors in R.O.T.C. classes, selecting and training the 
              next generation of soldiers.</p>
            <P> In the darker recesses of the world, private contractors go where 
              the Pentagon would prefer not to be seen, carrying out military 
              exercises for the American government, far from Washington's view. 
              In the last few years, they have sent their employees to Bosnia, 
              Nigeria, Macedonia, Colombia and other global hot spots.</p>
            <P> Motivated as much by profits as politics, these companies — about 
              35 all told in the United States — need the government's permission 
              to be in business. A few are somewhat familiar names, like Kellogg 
              Brown & Root, a subsidiary of the Halliburton Company that operates 
              for the government in Cuba and Central Asia. Others have more cryptic 
              names, like DynCorp; Vinnell, a subsidiary of TRW; SAIC; ICI of 
              Oregon; and Logicon, a unit of Northrop Grumman. One of the best 
              known, MPRI, boasts of having "more generals per square foot than 
              in the Pentagon."</p>
            <P> During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, one of every 50 people on 
              the battlefield was an American civilian under contract; by the 
              time of the peacekeeping effort in Bosnia in 1996, the figure was 
              one in 10. No one knows for sure how big this secretive industry 
              is, but some military experts estimate the global market at $100 
              billion. As for the public companies that own private military contractors, 
              they say little if anything about them to shareholders.</p>
            <P> "Contractors are indispensible," said John J. Hamre, deputy secretary 
              of defense in the Clinton administration. "Will there be more in 
              the future? Yes, and they are not just running the soup kitchens."</p>
            <P> That means even more business, and profits, for contractors who 
              perform tasks as mundane as maintaining barracks for overseas troops, 
              as sophisticated as operating weapon systems or as secretive as 
              intelligence-gathering in Africa. Many function near, or even at, 
              the front lines, causing concern among military strategists about 
              their safety and commitment if bullets start to fly.</p>
            <P> The use of military contractors raises other troubling questions 
              as well. In peace, they can act as a secret army outside of public 
              view. In war, while providing functions crucial to the combat effort, 
              they are not soldiers. Private contractors are not obligated to 
              take orders or to follow military codes of conduct. Their legal 
              obligation is solely to an employment contract, not to their country.</p>
            <P> Private military contractors are flushing out drug traffickers 
              in Colombia and turning the rag-tag militias of African nations 
              into fighting machines. When a United Nations arms embargo restricted 
              the American military in the Balkans, private military contractors 
              were sent instead to train the local forces.</p>
            <P> At times, the results have been disastrous. </p>
            <P> In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave 
              ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports 
              were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used 
              what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic 
              cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds 
              dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments. No employee of either 
              firm has ever been charged in these incidents.</p>
            <P> In Peru last year, a plane carrying an American missionary and 
              her infant was accidentally shot down when a private military contractor 
              misidentified it as on a drug smuggling flight.</p>
            <P> MPRI, formerly known as Military Professionals Resources Inc., 
              may provide the best example of how skilled retired soldiers cash 
              in on their military training. Its roster includes Gen. Carl E. 
              Vuono, the former Army chief of staff who led the gulf war and the 
              Panama invasion; Gen. Crosbie E. Saint, the former commander of 
              the United States Army in Europe; and Gen. Ron Griffith, the former 
              Army vice chief of staff. There are also dozens of retired top-ranked 
              generals, an admiral and more than 10,000 former military personnel, 
              including elite special forces, on call and ready for assignment.</p>
            <P> "We can have 20 qualified people on the Serbian border within 
              24 hours," said Lt. Gen. Harry E. Soyster, the company's spokesman 
              and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. "The Army 
              can't do that. But contractors can."</p>
            <P> For that, MPRI is paid well. Its revenue exceeds $100 million 
              a year, mainly from Pentagon and State Department contracts. Retired 
              military personnel working for MPRI receive two to three times their 
              Pentagon salaries, in addition to their retirement benefits and 
              corporate benefits like stock options and 401(k) plans. MPRI's founders 
              became millionaires in July 2000, when they and about 35 equity 
              holders sold the company for $40 million in cash to L-3 Communications, 
              a military contractor traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
            <P> Within the military, the use of contractors is Defense Department 
              policy for filling the gaps as the number of troops falls. At the 
              time of the gulf war, there were 780,000 Army troops; today there 
              are 480,000. Over the same period, overall military forces have 
              fallen by 500,000. </p>
            <P> Pentagon officials did not respond to many telephone calls and 
              e-mail messages requesting interviews, but they have maintained 
              that contractors are a cost-effective way of extending the military's 
              reach when Congress and the American public are reluctant to pay 
              for more soldiers.</p>
            <P> "The main reason for using a contractor is that it saves you from 
              having to use troops, so troops can focus on war fighting," said 
              Col. Thomas W. Sweeney, a professor of strategic logistics at the 
              Army War College in Carlisle, Pa. "It's cheaper because you only 
              pay for contractors when you use them."</p>
            <P> But one person's cost-saving device can be another's "guns for 
              hire," as David Hackworth, a former Army colonel and frequent critic 
              of the military, called them. </p>
            <P> "These new mercenaries work for the Defense and State Department 
              and Congress looks the other way," Colonel Hackworth, a highly decorated 
              Vietnam veteran, said. "It's a very dangerous situation. It allows 
              us to get into fights where we would be reluctant to send the Defense 
              Department or the C.I.A. The American taxpayer is paying for our 
              own mercenary army, which violates what our founding fathers said."</p>
            <P> They are not mercenaries in the classic sense. Most, but not all, 
              private military contractors are unarmed, even when they oversee 
              others with guns. They have even formed a trade group, the International 
              Peace Operations Association, to promote industry standards.</p>
            <P> "We don't want to risk getting contracts by being called mercenaries," 
              said Doug Brooks, president of the association. "But we can do things 
              on short notice and keep our mouths shut."</p>
            <P> That, some critics say, is part of the problem. By using for-profit 
              soldiers, the government, especially the executive branch, can evade 
              Congressional limits on troop strength. For instance, in Bosnia, 
              where a cap of 20,000 troops was imposed by Congress, the addition 
              of 2,000 contractors helped skirt that restriction.</p>
            <P> Contractors also allow the administration to carry out foreign 
              policy goals in low-level skirmishes around the globe — often fueled 
              by ethnic hatreds and a surplus of cold war weapons — without having 
              to fear the media attention that comes if American soldiers are 
              sent home in body bags. </p>
            <P> At least five DynCorp employees have been killed in Latin America, 
              with no public outcry. Denial is easier for the government when 
              those working overseas do not wear uniforms — they often wear fatigues 
              or military-looking clothes but not official uniforms.</p>
            <P> "If you sent in troops, someone will know; if contractors, they 
              may not," said Deborah Avant, an associate professor of political 
              science at George Washington University and author of many studies 
              on the subject.</p>
            <P> Only a few members of Congress have expressed concern about the 
              phenomenon. </p>
            <P> "There are inherent difficulties with the increasing use of contactors 
              to carry out U.S. foreign policy," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, 
              Democrat of Vermont and the chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee. 
              "This is especially true when it involves `private' soldiers who 
              are not as accountable as U.S. military personnel. Accountability 
              is a serious issue when it comes to carrying guns or flying helicopters 
              in pursuit of U.S. foreign policy goals."</p>
            <P> In the House, Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, 
              led the battle against a Bush administration effort to remove the 
              cap that limits the number of American troops in Colombia to 500 
              and private contractors to 300.</p>
            <P> "American taxpayers already pay $300 billion a year to fund the 
              world's most powerful military," Ms. Schakowsky said. "Why should 
              they have to pay a second time in order to privatize our operations? 
              Are we outsourcing in order to avoid public scrutiny, controversy 
              or embarrassment? Is it to hide body bags from the media and thus 
              shield them from public opinion?"</p>
            <P>
              SUCH concerns are hardly slowing the pace across the Potomac, at 
              MPRI in Alexandria, Va. The company may look like hundreds of other 
              white-collar concerns that fill small office buildings in northern 
              Virginia, but there are telltale signs to the contrary: the sword 
              that serves as the corporate logo and conference rooms named the 
              Infantry Room, the Cavalry Room and the Artillery Room. Its art 
              consists of paintings of celebrated battles, largely from the Civil 
              War.</p>
            <P> It's hard to tell where the United States military ends and MPRI 
              begins. For the last four years, MPRI has run R.O.T.C. training 
              programs at more than 200 universities, under a contract that has 
              allowed retired military to put their uniforms back on. It recently 
              lost the contract to a lower bidder, but MPRI offset the loss with 
              one to provide former soldiers to run recruitment offices.</p>
            <P> The company, which has 900 full-time employees, helps run the 
              United States Army Force Management School at Fort Belvoir. It also 
              provides instructors for advanced training classes at Fort Leavenworth, 
              teaches the Civil Air Patrol and designs courses at Fort Sill, Fort 
              Knox, Fort Lee and other military centers.</p>
            <P> The Pentagon has even hired MPRI to help it write military doctrine 
              — including the field manual called "Contractors Support on the 
              Battlefield" that sets rules for how the Army should interact with 
              private contractors, like itself.</p>
            <P> Overseas, MPRI is, if anything, more active. Under a program it 
              calls "democracy transition," the company has offered countries 
              like Nigeria, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Ukraine, Croatia and 
              Macedonia training in American-style warfare, including war games, 
              military instruction and weapons training.</p>
            <P> In Croatia, MPRI was brought in to provide border monitors in 
              the early 1990's. Then, in 1994, as the United States grew concerned 
              about the poor quality of the Croatian forces and their ability 
              to maintain regional stability, it turned to MPRI. A United Nations 
              arms embargo in 1991, approved by the United States, prohibited 
              the sale of weapons or the providing of training to any warring 
              party in the Balkans. But the Pentagon referred MPRI to Croatia's 
              defense minister, who hired the company to train its forces.</p>
            <P> In 1995, MPRI started doing so, teaching the fledgling army military 
              tactics that MPRI executives had developed while on active duty 
              commanding the gulf war invasion. Several months later, armed with 
              this new training, the Croatian army began Operation Storm, one 
              of the bloodiest episodes of "ethnic cleansing" in the Balkans, 
              an event that also reshaped the military balance in the region.</p>
            <P> The operation drove more than 100,000 Serbs from their homes in 
              a four-day assault. Investigators for the international war crimes 
              tribunal in the Hague found that the Croatian army carried out summary 
              executions and indiscriminately shelled civilians. "In a widespread 
              and systematic matter, Croatian troops committed murder and other 
              inhumane acts," investigators said in their report. Several Croatian 
              generals in charge of the operation have been indicted for war crimes 
              and are being sought for trial.</p>
            <P> "No MPRI employee played a role in planning, monitoring or assisting 
              in Operation Storm," said Lieutenant General Soyster, the MPRI spokesman. 
              He did say that a few Croatian graduates of MPRI's training course 
              participated in the operation.</p>
            <P> Yet what happened in Croatia gave MPRI international brand recognition 
              and more business in that region. When Bosnian Muslims balked in 
              1995 at signing the Dayton peace accords out of fear that their 
              army was ill-equipped to provide sufficient protection, MPRI was 
              called in.</p>
            <P> "The Bosnians said they would not sign unless they had help building 
              their army," said Peter Singer, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings 
              Institution who is writing a book on contractors. "And they said 
              they wanted the same guys who helped the Croatians."</p>
            <P> That is who they got. Under a plan worked out by American negotiators, 
              the Bosnian Muslims hired MPRI using money that was provided by 
              a group of Islamic nations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brunei, 
              the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. These nations deposited money 
              in the United States Treasury, which MPRI drew against.</p>
            <P> "It was a brilliant move in that the U.S. government got someone 
              else to pay for what we wanted from a policy standpoint," Mr. Singer 
              said.</p>
            <P> At the moment, MPRI is advertising for special forces for antiterrorist 
              operations, is bulking up to train American forces in Kuwait and 
              is looking for people with special skills like basic-training instruction 
              and counterintelligence. Recently, however, it lost a $4.3 million 
              contract to provide training to the army in Colombia when officials 
              there complained about what they called the poor quality of MPRI's 
              services.</p>
            <P> In Africa, MPRI has conducted training programs on security issues 
              for about 120 African leaders and more than 5,500 African troops. 
              Most recently, it went toe to toe with the State Department, and 
              won, gaining permission to do business in Equatorial Guinea, a country 
              with a deplorable human rights record where the United States does 
              not have an embassy.</p>
            <P> After two years of lobbying at the State Department, and after 
              being turned down twice on human rights grounds, MPRI was finally 
              given approval last year to work with President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, 
              whom the State Department describes as holding power through torture, 
              fraud and a 98 percent election mandate. MPRI advised President 
              Obiang on building a coast guard to protect the oil-rich waters 
              being explored Exxon 
              Mobil off the coast. </p>
            <P> More recently, when MPRI and President Obiang proposed that MPRI 
              also help the country build its police and military forces, the 
              State Department objected and the project is now dormant.</p>
            <P> "We thought helping the coast guard would be pretty innocuous 
              in terms of human rights," Lieutenant General Soyster of MPRI said. 
              But Ms. Avant of George Washington University disagreed, saying 
              any alliance with United States military contractors would strengthen 
              President Obiang's power.</p>
            <P> MPRI is not the only company to have run into problems overseas. 
              DynCorp, a privately held company in Reston, Va., with nearly $2 
              billion in annual sales, has been tapped to provide protection for 
              Mr. Karzai in Afghanistan. DynCorp also provides worldwide protective 
              services for State Department employees.</p>
            <P> In late September, DynCorp settled charges — for an undisclosed 
              sum — brought by a whistle-blower the company had fired after he 
              complained of a sex ring run by DynCorp employees in Bosnia. In 
              August, a British court, meanwhile, ruled in favor of another former 
              DynCorp employee in a separate whistle-blower case. DynCorp is appealing.</p>
            <P> The two employees made similar accusations: that while working 
              in Bosnia, where DynCorp was providing military equipment maintenance 
              services, DynCorp employees kept underaged women as sex slaves, 
              even videotaping a rape. Among the charges was that while the DynCorp 
              employees trafficked in women — including buying one for $1,000 
              — the company turned a blind eye. Since the DynCorp employees involved 
              were not soldiers, their actions were not subject to military discipline. 
              Nor did they face local justice; they were simply fired and sent 
              home.</p>
            <P> In both cases, after complaining, the two employees who blew the 
              whistle were fired. Ben Johnston, one of them, said last April in 
              Congressional testimony: "DynCorp employees were living off post 
              and owning these children and these women and girls as slaves. Well, 
              that makes all Americans look bad. I believe DynCorp is the worst 
              diplomat our country could ever want overseas."</p>
            <P> A DynCorp spokesman, Chuck Taylor, said the company "felt horrible" 
              and held its own internal investigation before firing the employees 
              who operated the ring. </p>
            <P> DynCorp also handles aerial anti-narcotics efforts for the United 
              States government in the skies over Colombia and nearby countries 
              — where several employees have been killed. Because of Congressional 
              caps on the use of private military contractors, DynCorp has hired 
              local citizens; two were recently killed. </p>
            <P> Still, in its recruiting material, the company plays up the excitement 
              of this type of work: "Being the best is never easy and when your 
              office is the cockpit of a twin-engine plane swooping low over the 
              Colombian jungle, the challenges can often be enormous." </p>
            <P> Incidents like these — sex rings, deals with dictators, misused 
              military training and tragic accidents — raise questions about the 
              use of contractors. To whom are they accountable: the United States 
              government or their contract? When such incidents occur, who bears 
              the responsibility?</p>
            <P> Moreover, while the general mantra about military privatization 
              is that it saves money, there are few studies to prove the case 
              — and in fact, reports exist to the contrary. </p>
            <P> For instance, Kellogg Brown & Root, which was paid $2.2 billion 
              to provide logistics support to American troops in the Balkans, 
              was the subject of a General Accounting Office report entitled, 
              "Army Should Do More to Control Contract Costs in the Balkans." 
              The office found that the Army was not exercising enough oversight 
              on Kellogg Brown & Root as contract costs rose, to the benefit of 
              the company. Still, the company continues to pick up new business.</p>
            <P> Questions about security and control are even more basic. In the 
              battlefield, a commander cannot give orders to a contractor as he 
              can a soldier. Contractors are not compelled by an oath of office, 
              as soldiers are, but instead by an employment contract that provides 
              little flexibility. Nor are contractors subject to the Uniform Code 
              of Military Justice.</p>
            <P> Contractors cannot arm themselves — they risk losing their status 
              as noncombatants if they do and, in the extreme, could be declared 
              mercenaries and subject to execution if captured. Yet in the gulf 
              war, contractors were in the thick of battle, providing maintenance 
              to tanks and biological and chemical vehicles as well as flying 
              air support. </p>
            <P> Should there be a war in Iraq, the line could be even blurrier.</p>
            <P> "There are no rear areas anymore," Colonel Sweeney of the Army 
              War College said. With chemical and biological weapons, "no place 
              is safe," he said.</p>
            <P> "You can't draw a map and say `no contractors forward of this 
              line,' " he added. "The American concept of combat is to take the 
              battle to the rear areas and be as disruptive as possible. The other 
              guy is thinking the same thing."</p>
            <P> One tenet of warfare is that soldiers handling support functions 
              can grab a gun and hit the front lines if needed. While this is 
              often dismissed as a quaint World War II concept, it happened in 
              Somalia in 1993 when Army rangers were in trouble and military supply 
              clerks came to their rescue. When the support staff is filled with 
              contractors, would they do the same? Or would commanders in the 
              field become responsible for the safety of the growing number of 
              contractor employees at the expense of advancing the battle?</p>
            <P> The issue is just beginning to generate some attention in military 
              circles.</p>
            <P> "We sort of blur the lines," Col. Steven J. Zamparelli of the 
              Air Force said in an interview. In an article in 1999 for the Air 
              Force Journal of Logistics, Colonel Zamaparelli said: "The Department 
              of Defense is gambling future military victory on contractors' performing 
              operational functions in the battlefield."</p>
            <P> Others in the military are more blunt about the effect on soldiers. 
              "Are we ultimately trading their blood to save a relatively insignificant 
              amount in the national budget?" said Lt. Col. Lourdes A. Castillo 
              of the Air Force, a logistics expert, in a 2000 article in Aerospace 
              Power Journal. "If this grand experiment undertaken by our national 
              leadership fails during wartime, the results will be unthinkable." </p>
