WASHINGTON -- Under strong criticism from human rights groups for inviting Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov to the White House, United States President George W. Bush Tuesday met behind closed doors with the Uzbeki leader, who has become a key strategic ally in Bush's war on terrorism in Central Asia. 
<p>A spokesman later insisted to reporters that Bush had "stressed the 

importance of progress in human rights to the future and strength of 

Uzbekistan and to U.S.-Uzbekistan relations" in the 45-minute meeting at the same time that he welcomed "a new chapter" in relations between the two countries.
<p>



Major rights groups have assailed Karimov, who has ruled Uzbekistan since even before the Soviet Union's collapse, as one of Central Asia's harshest dictators. The groups cite his banning of opposition parties and his imprisonment of at least 7,000 Muslims for practicing their faith outside of approved mosques as among some of his abuses.
<p>



Torture and even Stalin-style "hate rallies" at which communities 

gather to denounce perceived religious "extremists" and their families are common, while police routinely detain family members as hostages to 

compel suspected dissidents to surrender, according to rights groups.
<p>



"In terms of human rights, Uzbekistan is barely distinguishable from 

its Soviet past, and President Karimov has shown himself to be an 

unreconstructed Soviet leader," said Elizabeth Anderson, who directs the Europe and Central Asia division of <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW), which has an office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan's capital.
<p>



In a letter to Bush before this week's visit, HRW charged that 

Karimov's repression was driving many Uzbeks underground and into the ranks of insurgent groups, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which Bush has targeted in his anti-terrorist campaign.
<p>



Since the September 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, however, 

Washington has sought closer ties with Tashkent largely because of its 

strategic location as one of Afghanistan's northern neighbors. The Pentagon has been using at least one military base in Uzbekistan where it has deployed some 1,000 Rangers.
<p>



In return, Washington has reduced its public criticism of Karimov--who 

has just extended his term to 2007 in a referendum denounced by 

international observers as deeply flawed--and tripled its economic aid to Tashkent to &#36;160 million this year. The U.S. has also increased military aid in the form of training and equipment.
<p>



Rights groups have been pleading with the Bush administration to use 

the aid in order to gain concessions on human rights. So far, however, 

U.S. officials point only to Karimov's announcement on the eve of his four-day U.S. trip, that he would register one of a number of domestic human rights organizations which have clamored for legal status.
<p>



"The U.S. government needs to leverage its relations with Uzbekistan to 

press for prompt and substantial improvements in human rights," William 

Schultz, the director of the U.S. section of <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> 

(AIUSA), said Monday in advance of a demonstration at the Uzbekistan 

embassy in Washington.
<p>



"Arming Uzbekistan may give tools to human rights violators and also 

provoke regional instability in terms of Uzbekistan's Central Asian 

neighbors," added Maureen Greenwood, AIUSA's advocacy director for 

Europe.
<p>



Even before September 11, Karimov had invited Washington to establish a 

permanent military presence in Uzbekistan, apparently as part of an effort both to ward off pressure from Russia or China and as a security 

guarantee against internal opposition.
<p>



Tom Malinowski, director of HRW's Washington office, said this week 

Washington should use that as a way to encourage reform. "What [U.S. 

officials] don't seem to get is that they have extraordinary leverage now," he said. "It's going to be much smaller [in the future] and they need to use it."
<p>



In a joint declaration issued at the end of a meeting Tuesday between 

Secretary of State Colin Powell  and his Uzbek counterpart, Abdulaziz 

Kamilov, Washington pledged to "regard with grave concern" any external 

threats to Tashkent's security, while Uzbekistan promised to intensify 

democratic and economic reforms.
<p>



Karimov is scheduled to meet with Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld 

Wednesday before flying on to New York City where he will meet with the new mayor, Michael Bloomberg.
