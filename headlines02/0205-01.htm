A chorus of European leaders indicated yesterday that they would oppose military 
action against the states identified by George Bush as an "axis of evil", as the 
split between Europe and Washington widened further. 
<P>Germany led the protests, sending a shrill, clear signal that it wants nothing 
to do with an attack on Iraq, named alongside Iran and North Korea in President 
Bush's state of the union address a week ago. 
<P>Berlin's deputy foreign minister, Ludger Vollmer, said: "We Europeans warn 
against it. There is no indication, no proof that Iraq is involved in the terrorism 
we have been talking about for the last few months... this terror argument cannot 
be used to legitimise old enmities." 
<P>German leaders have repeatedly expressed opposition in recent months to an 
extension of the military war on terrorism. "Iraq is certainly a bad state. We 
see few positive signs there," Mr Vollmer said yesterday. "But the solution cannot 
lie in attacking it militarily." 
<P>Other EU member states said they planned to stick with their dialogues with 
Iran and North Korea. Diplomats in Brussels said yesterday there were no plans 
to review relations, in line with the union's policy of engaging with countries 
rather than seeking to isolate them. 
<P>Echoing statements by Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, EU sources insisted 
it was important to encourage moderates in Iran against clerical and hardline 
groups, including those apparently responsible for an arms shipment to the Palestinian 
Authority. 
<P>Asked about Mr Bush's approach to the "axis of evil", European Commission spokesman 
Gunnar Weigand said senior EU representatives "do not agree with that kind of 
policy". 
<P>The EU shared America's aims on human rights, terrorism and weapons proliferation, 
he said, but "what we do not share is the policy desired to achieve these objectives. 
We believe that engagement and rapprochement... should be used to achieve these 
aims." 
<P>Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, urged the US to act multilaterally 
and not as a "global unilateralist". 
<P>Privately, EU diplomats have dismissed Mr Bush's remarks as being made to suit 
a domestic audience, and say they are viewed with unease by the secretary of state, 
Colin Powell, and other doves in the cabinet. Publicly, they can do little more 
than put on a brave face. 
<P>The objections are likely to further enrage the Bush administration, which 
responded with fury to a comment by Mr Straw on Friday that the "axis of evil" 
speech was more of a vote-winning tactic in forthcoming US elections than a military 
strategy. 
<P>Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said: "This is 
not about American politics, and I assume that when the British government speaks 
about foreign policy, it's not about British politics." 
<P>EU foreign ministers are likely to discuss the issue when they meet in the 
Spanish town of Caceres at the weekend, where they will have to tread carefully 
over a request by Iraq to hold talks with Spain, holder of the EU's rotating presidency 
- a clear attempt to exploit transatlantic differences. 
<P>European leaders remain dubious about US charges that Iran exports terror or 
has links with al-Qaida. 
<P>The Russian defence minister, Sergei Ivanov, said on Sunday that there was 
no evidence that Iran had connections with terrorist organisations. He said Russia 
had its own list of "rogue states" and named the US's ally Saudi Arabia, which 
Moscow says helps fund Chechen separatists. 
<P>The controversy came as the Bush cabinet asked Congress to double US aid to 
Jordan to $448m (&#163;317m) in 2003, in a move to lay the ground for potential 
military action against its neighbour, Iraq. 
<P>The administration wants to give Jordan $198m in the form of weapons, up from 
$75m this year. Economic support funds would rise from $150m to $250m, according 
to budget documents. 
<P>"The money will be used to improve border controls targeting the flow of weapons, 
including weapons of mass destruction, and to support financial training, trade 
and investment and to strengthen educational opportunities," the White House office 
of management and budget said. 
<P>Iraq, Jordan's neighbour to the east, stands accused by the US of developing 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. On its western border, Jordan has sought 
to prevent the smuggling of arms to Palestinians fighting the Israeli occupation 
of the West Bank.
