<p>A member of a government advisory committee on coal charged last year that President Bush's decision to reverse himself on a campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions was a "monumental mistake" that resulted from vigorous coal industry pressure, newly disclosed documents show.</p>
    <p> Jane Hughes Turnbull, an executive of a California renewable energy concern, made the assertions in a March 16, 2001, letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham explaining her decision to resign from the National Coal Council, the advisory group. Bush had announced three days earlier that he had abandoned his campaign promise to reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that many scientists say is to blame for global warming.</p>
    <p> "The recent reversal in policy is profoundly short-sighted, an obvious and expedient response to industry -- I should say to misperceived industry interests," Turnbull said in her letter.</p>
    <p> Turnbull, a Clinton administration appointee, said it had become evident by the time of the 2000 presidential election that the coal industry's leadership "was intent on bolstering the economic well-being of the industry, if need be at the expense of the environment," rather than seeking a more balanced approach using both coal and cleaner, renewable energy sources.</p>
    <p> The letter was among 1,500 pages of documents related to Vice President Cheney's energy task force that were released this week in the latest response to a lawsuit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
    <p> The documents also include a March 28, 2001, letter from former House member Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) praising the administration for its handling of the carbon dioxide issue. His letter credited the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market policy think tank with financial backing from industry, for providing Bush with the "intellectual support and political cover to 'do the right thing' " on carbon dioxide emissions. Kemp was an institute fellow at the time.</p>
    <p> NRDC officials yesterday cited the two letters to Abraham as added evidence that industry officials played a key role in the president's decision to revise his plans on carbon dioxide emissions and Cheney's development of a national energy policy.</p>
    <p> "The coal industry and an industry front group appear to be dictating our nation's energy future," said NRDC senior attorney Sharon Buccino.  Jeanne Lopatto, the Energy Department's chief spokeswoman, dismissed Buccino's assertions as "recycled" criticisms lacking in substance.</p>
    <p> "If you look at the administration's national energy policy, the business groups had very little success in shaping" the final proposals, Lopatto said. "Eighty percent of the Nuclear Energy Institute's recommendations were rejected, 90 percent of the National Mining Association's recommendations were rejected, and 70 percent of the American Gas Association's recommendations were rejected."</p>
