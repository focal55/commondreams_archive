<p>CHAR CHINE, Afghanistan  — A circle of trampled wheat stalks and dark bloodstains marked the place where the three villagers died, one of them a 13-year-old boy — gunned down in an American air attack as they hid in the wheat field, relatives and neighbors here said.</p><P> They were among five people killed when American Special Forces raided this small farming village in the province of Oruzgan, on the night of May 12. Villagers said they fled their homes in the dark as planes and helicopters strafed the houses and fields, fired rockets and then landed dozens of soldiers to search the houses. They detained at least 20 villagers and a number of visitors, they said.</p><P> "They were hiding when they were hit, they were crouching down," said Saleh Muhammad, who found his brother, Lal, 35, his brother's son, Mohibullah, 13, and a neighbor, Sher Muhammad, two days later lying in the wheat field. "His wife said he went out to hide in the fields," he said of his brother. "When we couldn't find them we thought they had been arrested. It was only when we noticed the smell that we found them," he said.</p><P> The American Central Command in Tampa, Fla., has released details about the operation, saying that Special Forces troops had raided a compound suspected of being a sanctuary for senior members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The five killed had opened fire first, and 32 suspects had been detained for questioning, said Maj. Bryan Hilferty, a spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan.</p><P> ["Our information, from a variety of sources, indicated that this was a pocket of Al Qaeda and Taliban," Major Hilferty said on Sunday. "Our forces were fired upon and we responded appropriately to the threat to our forces." He said that "the detainees remain under U.S. control and we continue to question them."]</p><P> The remote regions of Oruzgan province and neighboring Helmand province are in fact suspected of harboring some of the most senior Taliban commanders, including the movement's reclusive leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, and his most notorious commanders, Mullah Bradar and Mullah Dadullah. None have been seen since losing their spiritual capital, Kandahar, in December. </p><P> But villagers and the anti-Taliban Afghan leaders who are now in charge of the district said the people who were killed here were just farmers and workers who had come to help with the harvest. Another teenager was among those killed. The boy, Mira Jan, a farmhand was 14 or 15, too young still to grow a beard. He was shot through the stomach while sleeping outside in the muddy front yard of the farmhouse where he worked. A 27-year-old farm laborer was also badly injured by gunfire in the chest and leg and was taken to a hospital, a seven-hour drive, villagers said.</p><P> Muhammad Jan, 35, ran out of his house but no one saw how he died. His brother Pir Muhammad was harvesting his poppies the next morning when neighbors called him. They had found his brother in the field. "I only saw his face," the brother said. "There was a big hole between his eyes. You could put three fingers in the hole." </p><P> The target of the raid appears to have been the house of Sayed Abdul Rahman Aga, the chief Muslim cleric of the area. It is a large house with guest rooms where, according to tradition here, passing travelers and itinerant workers are allowed to stay. Sayed Aga, a gentle-spoken man wearing a white turban, who is widely known in the region for his anti-Taliban stance, said he had 30 guests for dinner that night, some of whom were rounded up in the raid.</p><P> Sayed Aga said he had been sleeping up on the roof when the attack came, and he fled down the back stairs into the fields, narrowly escaping a volley of rocket fire that pursued him through the fields. Crouching by a tree, he was slightly injured by shrapnel as the missiles slammed into the wheat field beside him. The rocket fire had gouged dozens of craters, at least a yard in diameter of bare earth, into the wheat and poppy fields and into one house behind his own.</p><P> He said he did not know most of his guests, who were passing through, but the ones he knew were not members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda. One of them was the chief of the district agriculture section, he said. Relatives of the detainees clustered around a visitor to insist that they were poor farmers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers and traveling workers who had nothing to do with the Taliban or Al Qaeda. </p><P> "What is our guilt, that the Americans bombed here?" asked one, Abdul Zahir, whose son was arrested. "We are responsible for keeping the Taliban away." </p><P> This harsh southern province, a place of bare mountains and sun-baked valleys, is where most of the Taliban's leaders were born and brought up. While Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda followers appear to have moved eastward toward the Pakistan border after the collapse of the Taliban's government, Mullah Omar is thought to have taken to the mountains north of Kandahar where the mujahedeen survived for years fighting the Soviet Army.</p><P> Char Chine is the home village of Mullah Dadullah, and the former Taliban chief of staff, Mullah Fazel, who is reported to be among those imprisoned by the United States in Guantánamo, Cuba. Deh Rawud, a town to the south, was where Mullah Omar grew up and where he became friends with Mullah Bradar at the religious school.</p><P> Local leaders admit that senior Taliban leaders may be at large in the area, but they say they are probably high in the mountains or in remote hamlets, and certainly not living at home. "They are not coming here — if they did, we would arrest them or kill them," said Abdul Rahim, district chief in Deh Rawud.</p><P> The governor of Oruzgan province, Jan Muhammad, expressed frustration with the American raids — there have been two others in Mullah Bradar's home village just outside Deh Rawud in the last three months — which have only killed local people and have failed to net significant Taliban or Qaeda members. </p><P> The governor and district officials contended that the American Special Forces acted once again on faulty information and said they should have consulted with the people in charge in the province. They are also having to answer angry villagers, who until recently backed the Taliban and still feel tribal and family ties to the movement.</p><P> "They were ordinary people," Jan Muhammad said of the latest victims. "There were no Al Qaeda or Taliban there. I know there are senior Taliban in these places, but the Americans should come and ask me. Instead they come from Kandahar and bombard my province." </p><P> He likened the latest raid to the fatal American attack of Jan. 23 on the town of Oruzgan, when Special Forces troops mistakenly killed 21 people, including some of his top commanders, who were loyal to the interim government of Hamid Karzai. The Pentagon has since admitted killing friendly forces but puts the death toll at 16. </p><P> A coalition strike near the city of Khost on Thursday that killed 10 people was also challenged by local residents, who said they were involved in a local dispute and had no ties to Al Qaeda or the Taliban.</p><P> "People are saying you helped America and now they are bombing us," said Muhammad Ibrahim Akhunzada, one of Mr. Karzai's senior commanders and now chief of police in Deh Rawud district. "We are saying to the Americans that they should arrest and kill all Al Qaeda, because they are our enemies and they should not be in Afghanistan anymore. But we are worried about them making mistakes and killing ordinary people." </p><P> There may have been some Taliban members at Sayed Aga's house or in the village that night who escaped, some officials admitted. But they also questioned the tactics of the Special Forces.</p><P> Sayed Aga and other villagers said at least one airplane and up to a dozen helicopters began the raid at 11:30 p.m., firing as they swooped in on the village. Helicopters landed in the fields, and soldiers and dogs emerged. Taxi drivers later reported that Americans blocked off one of the rough approach roads to the village and drove several vehicles in. </p><P> Some farmers were sleeping in the fields, and some were irrigating them. Others dashed out of their houses and ran into the fields. The soldiers fanned out, searching houses, breaking doors and rounding up the men, the villagers said. The women, who mostly hid indoors with the children, were left alone.</p><P> "It was hard to see," Sayed Aga said. "They were shooting from the air, and from the ground. They were throwing smoke grenades." He said that he climbed a steep hill behind the village and that the raid finally ended at 3:30 a.m. </p><P> Abdul Mutalib was irrigating the fields that night when he saw the helicopters come in. "I saw the helicopters shooting and also dogs," he said.</p><P> "There was a plane high above," he continued. "One dog came running toward me barking. I gave him my shawl. The Americans were calling back the dogs and then shooting. I just ran. I ran all the way to the next village, 10 kilometers away. I got there at 4 in the morning." </p>
