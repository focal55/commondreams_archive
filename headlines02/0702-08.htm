<p>There is a long history to bombing blunders - and one lesson the military authorities around the world never seem to learn is the importance of avoiding dogmatic descriptions of what they think happened. 
<P>
These often turn out to be untrue or just half the truth and the aims of the overall campaign are submerged in a welter of claim and counterclaim. 
<P>
The public relations battle is an essential component of war.  
<P>
The latest disputed bombing in Afghanistan already shows the classic signs.
<P>
<B>'Errant' bomb</B>
<P>
On the one hand, there are the local people, talking to the media or their own government officials.
<P>
In this case, the story is that there was a wedding at which there some celebratory firing and then an attack out of the night. 
<P>
But take a look at what the Pentagon web site has been saying about it.
<P>
"An unknown number of Afghan civilians reportedly are casualties following a coalition air patrol's response to hostile ground fire, a Pentagon spokesman said."
<P>
It went on: "US Air Force B-52 and AC 130 aircraft struck several ground targets, including anti-aircraft sites that were engaging the aircraft, US Central Command officials said."
<P>
The Pentagon admitted that one bomb was an "errant."
<P>
But then said: "It's unclear whether those casualties were the result of our errant bomb or from falling anti-aircraft artillery."
<P>
<B>Wrong claims</B>
<P>
Note how certain the Pentagon is about the origin of this bombing - aircraft fired upon.
<P>
And yet there are plenty of examples from previous campaigns that such certainty often gives way to doubt and then yields place to new facts.
<P>
The initial account after all is usually based on what a pilot says and the assumptions a pilot make can be wrong.
<P>
This was a phenomenon in World War II when pilot claims of hits, honestly made, had to be revised later. 
<P>
Even if the Pentagon account is substantiated by the inquiries which will take place, an acknowledgement of the possibility of there being a different explanation might be wise. 
<P>
Indeed, in a later briefing at the Pentagon, the US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld cautioned reporters with the words: "These incidents, when they occur, take some time to sort out." He said that an investigating team was on the site.
<P>



<B>Soldiers killed</B>
<P>
The incident also makes it harder for the US and its Afghan allies to justify the operations still going on in Afghanistan.
<P>
These are designed to counter any attempt by the Taleban to reassert control in any area.
<P>
Such operations depend on local co-operation.
<P>
There was an incident in Afghanistan itself not long ago when four Canadian soldiers were killed from the air.
<P>
The first official story was also that a legitimate target had been attacked. Only later was an error admitted. 
<P>
<B>Kosovo convoy</B>
<P>
During the Kosovo war, a convoy was bombed.
<P>
At first, it was stated firmly that it had been a military convoy.
<P>
However, reporters taken to the scene by the Serbs said that it had been a convoy of tractors carrying people going home. 
<P>
It turned out that the pilots were flying too high to identify the vehicles which to them looked like trucks. 
<P>
It took a long time for the truth to emerge.  Even after a Pentagon official in Washington had accepted that a mistake had been made, Nato officials in Brussels were sticking by the old story for hours afterwards.
<P>
The mistake the military spokespeople often make is to believe that honesty is not the best policy. 
<P>
It is often the other way round, especially in modern campaigns in which the effect of the conduct of the war on public opinion can be crucial in sustaining support for it - or ending it.
