<p>ATARA, West Bank - Zaheyyeh Dahadha wept on
Wednesday as she paid her last respects to her life-long friend
Fatima Hassan, at 95 the oldest known Palestinian victim of two
years of conflict with Israel.<P> Dahadha, 82, was among hundreds of people who attended
Hassan's funeral in the West Bank village of Atara, a day after
Israeli troops shot her dead as she drove home in a taxi after
having a medical checkup and buying sweets in nearby Ramallah.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

                  City of Ramallah, December 4, 2002. Obeid was killed when Israeli 
                  soldiers opened fire on the van she was traveling in near Ramallah, 
                  Palestinian witnesses and medics said. REUTERS/Osama Silwadi

</table></font>Dahadha said she had seen Hassan almost every day for more
than half a century.<P> &quot;Look at my eyes. I have not stopped crying since I heard
the bad news,&quot; she said after kissing Hassan's cheeks as the
corpse lay on a pink stretcher before the burial.<P> &quot;We used to see each other every day. She's gone now. It's
like a dream. I cannot believe what happened to her.&quot;<P> Palestinian witnesses said a soldier at the northern edge of
Ramallah smashed the windows of the taxi in which Hassan was
travelling and peppered the vehicle with bullets. The witnesses
said the taxi was waiting in a long line of vehicles.<P> The army said it was investigating the incident. Israeli
military sources said troops shot at the tyres of a Palestinian
vehicle that had been travelling on a prohibited road near
Ramallah after the driver ignored orders to halt.<P> The violence in the last two years has claimed innocent
victims on both sides, including women, children and the
elderly. At least 1,694 Palestinians and 668 Israelis have died
since the Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation began in
September 2000.<P> Relatives said Hassan had been in Ramallah for a regular
medical checkup and had bought sweets for the Muslim feast of
Eid al-Fitr which marks the end of the holy fasting month of
Ramadan.<P> Stunned women, some crying, stood in front of their houses
as men carried the coffin on their shoulders through Atara's
narrow alleyways.<P> &quot;Her death broke my heart,&quot; one woman told her neighbour.<P> Medics said Hassan was hit by a bullet in her back and two
other women in the taxi were also wounded.<P> Israel has blocked the entrances of most West Bank villages
and towns with trenches, long lines of rubble, cement blocks or
checkpoints since the start of the Palestinian uprising.<P> Israel says such measures are necessary to prevent militants
from carrying out suicide bombings and other attacks in the
Jewish state. Palestinians say the measures amount to collective
punishment.<P> Hassan was buried in the village cemetery, where wreaths and
banners lay over her grave. One banner read: &quot;A message to the
international conscience: why kill a 95-year-old woman?&quot;
