<p>ROME - Hundreds of thousands of workers staged demonstrations across Italy 
on Friday as the country's largest union caused disarray with a one-day strike 
over the center-right government's economic policies.
<p>It was the second general strike in six months and follows  dozens of half- and full-day stoppages across a range of  industries this year as worker anger over Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi's policies boils to the surface.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

Demonstrators take part in a rally organized by CGIL union in central Rome's Piazza 
Navona square during a national strike October 18, 2002. Italy's air, rail and 
public transport systems were thrown into disarray on Friday as the country's 
largest union launched a one-day strike against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's 
economic policies. The strike by CGIL union, which represents nearly six million 
people, comes at a sensitive time for the government as it wrestles with a stagnant 
economy and a deepening crisis at carmaker Fiat, the country's largest private 
employer. REUTERS/Vincenzo Pinto <br>

</table></font>Air, rail and public transport systems were affected on  Friday as an estimated 250,000 union workers marched through  the streets of the financial capital Milan and similar rallies  were held in more than 100 other locations countrywide.<p>The demonstrations are a major headache for Berlusconi, who  has never forgotten that the last time he was prime minister,  in 1994, his government fell after just seven months shortly  after millions took to the streets to oppose planned pension  reforms.<p>The left-wing union has said it called the strike because  Berlusconi's budget and financial policies, as well as his  labor reforms, are aggravating the economic slowdown and could  end up putting about 280,000 people out of work.<p>While the strike snarled public transport and was expected  to interrupt nearly half of all rail services, it was not  likely to bring Italy to a standstill since the two other major  union groups have refused to back the walkout.<p>The one-day action in April had been backed by all three  major union federations and produced the biggest work stoppage  Italy had seen in two decades, with about 13 million people  staying away from work.<p>Friday's strike by the CGIL union, which represents nearly  six million people, comes at a sensitive time for the  government, which is wrestling with a stagnant economy and a  deepening crisis at carmaker Fiat, the country's largest  private employer.<p>"We are demonstrating that we are still alive, that we are  fighting," said Vittorio Iori, a CGIL member, as he marched  under a banner through the streets of Rome.<p>FOREIGNERS STRANDED<p>Around 35,000 national and international air travelers were  expected to be affected as airline Alitalia canceled or delayed  more than half its scheduled flights and other carriers were  forced to abandon connections into and out of Italy.<p>CGIL organized 120 rallies around the country, with the  main demonstration planned for Fiat's northern hometown, Turin.<p>"We've won the challenge," declared Guglielmo Epifani, the  head of the union, as he addressed tens of thousands of workers  in Turin's central square. "The strike, which has been adhered  to throughout the country, tells us that we are right."<p>In recent weeks, Italian companies have announced more than  20,000 lay-offs, with Fiat alone planning to shed 8,100 workers  -- about 20 percent of its Italian auto workforce -- as it  struggles to return to profit.<p>More than 1,000 workers from a Fiat factory in Sicily  traveled to Rome on Thursday to protest against the threatened  lay-offs, but were prevented by police from marching on the  government's headquarters.<p>Berlusconi, a billionaire businessman who portrays himself  as a champion of the market economy, has pledged a "strategic  strengthening" of Italy's once-vibrant vehicle sector, raising  speculation that the state might buy into Fiat.<p>But with government coffers running low because of the  general economic downturn, such a move looks increasingly  fanciful. Some Berlusconi allies argue quietly that Fiat should  be left to the mercies of market forces.<p>Epifani, who became CGIL chief last month, said this week  Friday's stoppage was to show the government just how urgently  it needs to rework its financial and social policies.<p>After the April general strike, which was a protest against  the government's plans for reforms to make hiring and firing  easier, the government struck a deal with two of the big three  union federations to water down the proposals.<p>The CGIL is hoping Friday's demonstration will prompt the  government to reconsider not only the labor reforms but also  next year's budget, which it says does not do enough to spur  growth in an economy that has barely grown in the last year.
<p>"I hadn't realized that a general strike meant even the museums are closed," 
said Emma Marsh, 27, a British tourist in Venice whose flight to Gatwick was canceled. 
"But of all the places to be marooned by a strike I guess this is the best." (With 
additional reporting by Gianni Montani in Turin)
