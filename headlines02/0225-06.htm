JERUSALEM   - 
Feeling his men were vulnerable and
trigger-happy at their West Bank checkpoint, the Israeli army
reserve officer did the last thing anyone would have expected
of him -- he got up and left in protest.
<p>The officer was on his way to a military jail Monday. But
before starting a 28-day term for abandoning his post near
Jerusalem at the weekend, he blasted his superiors in an Israel
Radio interview.
<p>"We have reached a situation where we shoot out of fear" at
Palestinians, said the officer, using the assumed name of Ilan.
<p>Repeated Palestinian attacks against roadblocks, a hated
symbol of occupation, has troops more jittery than ever at the
risks of manning them as a Palestinian uprising enters its 18th
month. A raid last week killed six soldiers.
<p>Discontent in the army ranks has been expressed in other
ways, including a petition signed by more than 280 reservists
pledging their refusal to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
on behalf of what they say is a morally corrupting occupation.
<p>Sunday night, Israeli troops fired at the armored car of
Palestinian parliamentary speaker Ahmed Korei as it approached
a West Bank checkpoint.
<p>Israel apologized for the incident, from which Korei
emerged unscathed. The army said the soldiers feared the car
was going to hit them.
<p>"We use these bullets as a kind of shield, a wall, because
we don't have a wall or concrete to protect us ... in the end
the guys become trigger-happy and very jumpy," said Ilan, whose
rank was not given in the radio report.

<p>OFFICER SAYS HE WARNED SUPERIORS
<p>Ilan said he walked away after fruitless talks with
commanders on a lack of proper procedures which leave soldiers
scared for their own safety and make them dangerous to others.
<p>"I am not prepared to go to the parents of one of the
soldiers and tell them -- your son died in such a way without a
block of concrete to protect him."
<p>One of his superiors, Ilya Shifman, told the radio the army
often reviews security and investigates cases of misconduct.
<p>"But it can't be the case that an officer gets up and
leaves the company without telling anyone," Shifman said.
<p>The army also said last week it plans to remove many fixed
checkpoints and carry out surprise inspections along West Bank
roads to provide better security.
<p>Dozens of Israeli military blockades cut through main
arteries throughout the West Bank and Gaza, isolating
Palestinian cities and villages.
<p>Erected since the first Palestinian uprising in the late
1980s, Israel says they provide a barrier against gunmen and
suicide bombers. But Palestinians say the economically
crippling blockades mainly punish ordinary civilians.
<p>Palestinians frequently complain of abuse or outright
violence by soldiers at the roadblocks. Some troops admit to
buckling under the daily pressure of confronting potential
assailants in a sea of civilians.
<p>Monday, Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian man who
tried to circumvent a roadblock as he drove his pregnant wife
to hospital to give birth. The woman was wounded in the
shoulder.
<p>In a separate incident, troops killed a 15-year-old girl
who they said ran at their roadblock waving a knife.
<p>She left a suicide note, family members said.
<p>"I have decided by God's will to (attack) those arrogants
at the damned checkpoint and kill them to teach them a lesson
that they have no security on our land," it said.</p>
