<p> BOGOT&#193;, May 28  - As many Colombians celebrated the presidential victory of Alvaro Uribe V&#233;lez, officials from human rights and peace groups expressed fears Monday that more conflict was on the horizon.
<p>
While Colombia's President-elect has vowed to strengthen security forces, the groups believe careful measures will be needed to restore order in a nation desperate to end four decades of civil conflict.
<p>



"The problem is too big, the causes too complex, the history of violence too long to fix the thing with an authoritarian attitude," said Javier Moncayo, deputy director of the Project for Peace, which works in 29 townships in central Colombia to promote nonviolent solutions to the conflict.
<p>



Uribe, a tough-talking former governor, polled 53 percent in the election May 26, beating his nearest opponent by more than 20 points.
<p>



Speaking from the capital, Bogot&#225;, on election night, 49-year-old Uribe told supporters that he would seek international help to re-start talks with insurgents, but demanded that the armed groups first declare a ceasefire and an end to hostilities, a goal that eluded President Andr&#233;s Pastrana during three years of negotiations with the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
<p>



Uribe, who takes office on August 7, promised Colombians "security so [armed groups] don't kidnap the businessman, so they don't assassinate the union leader, so they don't extort the rancher, so they don't displace the peasant."
<p>



The 38-year civil war--which pits two main rebel groups against a paramilitary army and the government--claims nearly 3,500 lives a year and has forced more than one million people to flee their homes in the past four years. Thousands more are kidnapped every year.
<p>



Uribe's margin of victory, however, was widely interpreted as a mandate to crack down on the leftist rebels.
<p>



"What this is going to do is prolong the armed confrontation even longer and place the country at the edge of a situation that is almost civil war and dissolution," said Jorge Rojas, director of a Bogot&#225;-based human rights group known as CODHES, which works with the county's steeply rising internal refugee population.
<p>



Only about half of the 24 million people registered to vote in Colombia--a country of 40 million people--participated in the ballot.
<p>



One of those who did not vote was Javier Gonz&#225;lez, a cattle rancher who fled his home in southern C&#243;rdoba department in 1997 with his wife and six children after paramilitary fighters shot him and killed his father and brother. "We're not counting on any of these people to improve our situation," said 44-year-old Gonz&#225;lez.
<p>



Much of the campaigning was marred by intimidations and violence, with reports of paramilitary fighters threatening reprisals against those who did not vote for Uribe and rebels threatening to retaliate against those who did.
<p>



One of the candidates who appeared on the ballot, anti-establishment figure Ingrid Betancourt, was kidnapped by FARC fighters in February, along with her campaign manager, and has not been heard from since. She received less than one percent of the vote.
<p>



In April, four people were killed when a bomb, allegedly detonated by rebels, exploded near Uribe's motorcade in the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla. Four-weeks later, two bombs tore through his campaign office in Medell&#237;n, forcing Uribe to cut back on public appearances and address supporters via teleconferences and "infomercials."
<p>



A breakaway candidate from the Liberal Party, Uribe began as a dark horse in the presidential race. But growing disillusionment with the rebels and Uribe's tough talk convinced many Colombians to throw their support behind him at the expense of Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa.
<p>



Serpa finished with only 32 percent. Leftist candidate Luis Eduardo Garz&#243;n, whose running mate was a former rebel commander, finished third with six percent. Most of the campaign was centered on the guerrillas and the failed peace attempts made by Pastrana, who was constitutionally barred from seeking a second term.
<p>



Uribe--a fierce critic of Pastrana's peace talks and the safe haven set-up for the FARC in January 1999--has promised to streamline government, seek more military aid from the United States, and double the size of the armed forces.
<p>



His most controversial proposal is to recruit one million civilians to monitor criminal and rebel activity for the government, similar to the neighborhood watch groups Uribe championed while governor of Antioquia from 1995 until 1997.
<p>



Human rights groups claim the short-lived groups helped fuel the rise of the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), blamed for committing many human rights violations in Colombia.
<p>



Even though the AUC backed the Uribe presidency, Uribe has denied that he is tied to the group and has said he will fight them as hard as he will the rebels.
