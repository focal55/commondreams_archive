<p> The man President Bush tapped to lead his corporate crime watchdog team was 
a director of a San Francisco credit-card firm that just two years ago paid more 
than $400 million to settle charges that it cheated consumers. 
<P>Larry Thompson, named to lead the Bush administration's white-collar crime 
task force, served on the board of directors of Providian Financial Corp. at the 
same time regulators found that the firm systematically charged excessive fees 
and used deceptive sales tactics to bolster its bottom line.

</table></font>Thompson sat on Providian's board and served as chairman of the firm's audit 
and compliance committee from June 1997 until his unanimous confirmation by the 
Senate as deputy attorney general on May 10, 2001. 
<P>He sold his Providian stock -- said to be worth as much as $4.7 million -- 
to comply with ethics rules. The sale came just months before the firm disclosed 
looming problems with credit card defaults that led to the collapse of its stock 
and thousands of layoffs. 
<P>The revelations could be a potential embarrassment for Bush, who on Tuesday 
announced the creation of a white-collar crime task force to crack down on the 
type of corporate chicanery that has undermined public confidence in the stock 
market. 
<P>Bush had given Thompson until July 19 to convene the first meeting of the task 
force, but, in a surprise move, Thompson held the first session Friday at the 
White House. During the meeting, Thompson pledged to pursue corporate criminals 
"with vigor and an aggressive manner." 
<P>Thompson could not be reached for comment. A Justice Department spokesman, 
Mark Corallo, said Thompson knew nothing about the fraud and led the charge to 
clean house after Providian -- without admitting wrongdoing -- agreed to settle 
the matter in June 2000. Thompson was not questioned about the case during his 
confirmation hearing for the Justice Department appointment. 
<P>"He only became aware of the (fraud) issues when regulators began to make inquiries," 
Corallo told the Washington Post. "He then personally took the lead in making 
the company do the right thing, and it was his personal efforts that were a driving 
force in the company settling over $400 million and in implementing internal reforms 
and compliance measures." 
<P>Thompson's stock options in the company were vested on an accelerated basis 
so he could cash them in before he joined the Justice Department. 
<P>He held 89,651 shares, including unexercised options, on March 12, 2001, according 
to Providian's March 2001 proxy statement. When he took office on May 10, 2001, 
that stock had a market value of more than $4.7 million. 
<P>Insider trading is an issue in stockholder and employee lawsuits that accuse 
Providian officials of concealing financial problems while former CEO Shailesh 
Mehta and two other executives dumped shares. The alleged wrongdoing took place 
after Thompson left the board. 
<P>Providian's stock price began to slide after a Sept. 4, 2001, announcement 
that its third-quarter earnings would be lower than expected. The stock, which 
reached a 52-week high of $59.85 in July, 2001, eventually hit a low of $2 a share 
in November. It closed at $4.65 on Friday. 
<P>The company, once the nation's sixth-largest issuer of credit cards, agreed 
in June, 2000 to pay more than $300 million to settle charges that it fooled customers 
into buying products they didn't want. 
<P>The settlement, by far the largest ever negotiated by federal bank regulators, 
closed a one-year investigation by the San Francisco district attorney, California 
attorney general and the federal office of comptroller of the currency. 
<P>Six months later, the company paid an additional $105 million to settle the 
same allegations in a class-action suit filed on behalf of its customers. 
<P>Last March, Providian agreed to pay $38 million to settle a class-action lawsuit 
filed by shareholders alleging that the company inflated its profits through its 
price-gouging practices. 
<P>In the California probe, investigators found what District Attorney Terence 
Hallinan called "a web of deceptive and misleading business practices." 
<P>One area covered in the settlement was a Providian program that guaranteed 
big, though undisclosed, savings to customers who transferred balances from other 
card issuers, but only lowered interest rates by three-tenths of a percentage 
point or less. 
<P>Another area involves sales of fee-based products, such as credit protection, 
in which customers who thought they were only requesting information were charged 
for purchases. 
<P>In documents obtained by The Chronicle earlier this year, Providian founder 
Andrew Kahr wrote that, in lending to the kinds of high-risk customers Providian 
specialized in, the "problem is to squeeze out enough revenue and get customers 
to sit still for the squeeze." 
<P>In a March 1999 memorandum to Executive Vice President David Alvarez, he wrote: 
"Making people pay for access to credit is a lucrative business wherever it is 
practiced. . . . Is any bit of food too small to grab when you're starving and 
when there is nothing else in sight? The trick is charging a lot, repeatedly, 
for small doses of incremental credit."
