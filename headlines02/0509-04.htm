<p> WASHINGTON --
The Senate dealt a blow Wednesday to the 2 million people of Burkino Faso 
who already live on less than $1 a day and scratch out that meager living from 
cotton, trade and global economic experts said.

The Senate-passed farm bill -- which President Bush has said he will sign -- is likely to hurt residents of the West African nation and millions more of 
the world's poor, according to experts, as it increases spending for U.S. 
agricultural support by 80 percent over 10 years to $189 billion, much of it 
in subsidies for cotton, rice, wheat, corn and soybeans.
<P>But contentions about damage to people overseas were dismissed by the 
bill's supporters, such as Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
<P>"We stick up for our farmers," said Harkin, chairman of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee. "We work out what we feel is best for our producers and 
our farmers, not what's best for Germany or France or Brazil or China. . . . 
Our first obligation is to make sure we take care of our people first."
<P>About 150,000 American farmers will receive roughly 80 percent of the money 
in the bill -- primarily industrialized farms in the South and Midwest. Cotton 
and rice are also grown by a few large farms in California's Central Valley.
<P>About 90 percent of California farmers, who grow vegetables, fruits, nuts 
and other specialty crops, will see little aid from the legislation.
<P>"It's not about American agriculture," said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel. "It's 
about a few folks in agriculture, and it's especially not about California 
agriculture."
<P>The subsidies are expected to drive down world prices of key commodities, 
damaging the economies of the world's poorest countries, and remove pressure 
on Europe and Japan to reduce their subsidies. Agriculture provides about half 
of the gross domestic product of the world's poorest countries, said Thomas 
Beierle, an analyst with Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank.
<P>World Bank studies show that U.S. farm subsidies, combined with greater 
protection in Europe and Japan, total $350 billion a year, equivalent to the 
entire gross domestic product of sub-Saharan Africa and more than seven times 
what rich nations spend on foreign aid.
<P>"The signal this sends to the rest of the world is unmistakable," said M. 
Ann Tutwiler, president of the International Policy Council on Agriculture, 
Food and Trade, a research group. "The United States is not serious about 
agricultural trade reforms, and it is not serious about agricultural 
development in less-developed countries."
<P>A forthcoming World Bank-International Monetary Fund study finds that if 
cotton prices were not distorted by subsidies, Burkino Faso could cut in half 
the number of people living in poverty within six years.
<P>The farm bill's supporters said their concern was agriculture at home.
<P>"This is a bill for American farmers," said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
"This is a bill for America."
<P>But Farr called that claim a myth. "It's not an American farm bill," said 
Farr, who represents the Salinas Valley. "It's a farm bill for five 
commodities in America."
<P>The Senate approved the bill 64-35. California Democratic Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer voted for it.
<P>U.S. cotton producers received about $2 billion in subsidies last year, and 
the figure will jump sharply under the new bill. U.S. cotton subsidies have 
already pushed U.S. cotton exports to their highest level since 1926, putting 
downward pressure on world prices that now will intensify.
<P>"The problem with agriculture and textiles is that those are the sectors 
where the least skilled, poorest people can get a leg up," said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a think tank that focuses on 
global poverty. "So when we protect those sectors, we are taking jobs away 
from the poorest people in the poorest countries."
<P>The U.S. spends about $10 billion a year on foreign aid, Birdsall said, 
compared with the $18 billion a year that will now go mainly to large U.S. 
farms. "This is what we're spending on a few big farmers, versus the 3 billion-
plus people who live on under $2 a day," she said.
<P>The huge new subsidies are also likely to put the U.S. in violation of its 
trade commitments, analysts said, allowing other nations to retaliate against 
U.S. exports.
<P>The bill undermines the Bush administration's trade-opening agenda, 
reversing two decades of U.S. policy urging lower global farm subsidies as a 
way to increase U.S. farm exports, on which U.S. farmers depend.
<P>In the new round of global trade talks dubbed the "Development Round" 
because of its focus on aiding poor nations, the Bush administration said it 
would push for cuts in farm protection.
<P>"The mess just couldn't be worse," said Brink Lindsay, director of the Cato 
Institute's free-market Center for Trade Policy. "Our credibility in pushing 
for agriculture liberalization is now indistinguishable from absolute zero."
<P>The Bush administration had asked Congress for a farm bill that would 
emphasize conservation and market-oriented aid, but it made little effort to 
shape the bill, lobbyists on both sides said. The bill instead was driven by 
the battle for control of the House and Senate, where both parties are eager 
to win or hold seats in the Midwest and South.
<P>Bush has made trade liberalization a top priority and is in the middle of a 
Senate fight to win authority to negotiate a new global trade pact and expand 
the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada to the entire 
Western Hemisphere.
<P>But analysts agreed that administration support for the farm bill hurt 
Bush's credibility on trade.
<P>"The Bush administration talks the talk of free trade," Birdsall said, "but 
it hasn't walked the walk."</p>
