<p>WASHINGTON - A little-noticed provision in a new federal education law requires 
high schools to provide names, addresses, and phone numbers of students to military 
recruiters. Schools that refuse to comply face losing federal education funding 
under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

</table>Under the rule, part of the No Child Left Behind Act signed earlier this year, 
Pentagon recruiters are entitled to students' contact information unless parents 
opt out of sharing the data, a requirement that has alarmed civil libertarians 
and school administrators. 
<P> ''We don't wish to appear antimilitary. The military is a great first step 
out of high school for a lot of kids, and it is a fine career for some people,'' 
said Bruce Hunter, a lobbyist for the American Association of School Administrators. 
<P> Nevertheless, the association opposed the provision because it took discretion 
away from local school boards. ''We weren't happy because we're a big local control 
outfit.'' 
<P> The law also requires high schools to allow military recruiters the same campus 
access as administrators give to colleges and job recruiters. Some schools, including 
those in San Francisco and Portland, Ore., had refused military recruiters access 
to their campuses on the grounds that the Pentagon discriminated against gays 
and lesbians. 
<P> Education Secretary Rod Paige sent a letter last month to school administrators 
explaining the new regulations. Department spokesman Jim Bradshaw said the rationale 
for the rule was that the military ''felt this was needed to boost recruitment.'' 
<P> Major Sandy Troeber, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said the rules were 
''brought about by congressional support for military recruiting efforts.'' The 
Selective Service already requires men in the United States to register for the 
draft within 30 days of their 18th birthday. 
<P> But a fact sheet provided by the Pentagon said that the cost of recruiting 
had doubled in the past decade and that ''access to students can significantly 
reduce the costs of recruiting.'' 
<P> The Pentagon had been trying for years to insert the recruitment provisions 
into education legislation to counter what they saw as a lack of cooperation from 
some high schools, according to lobbyists and congressional aides. But this year 
the education bill was so loaded with other contentious issues, such as school 
vouchers, funding matters, and testing standards, that lawmakers who might have 
fought the new recruitment rules had their energies focused on other provisions. 
<P> ''It wasn't on anybody's radar. It was buried so deep in the legislation,'' 
said Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman for the National Education Association. The group 
has only recently begun studying the issue and hasn't yet taken a position on 
it, she said. 
<P> Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts and a major negotiator 
on the Leave No Child Behind Act, had fought successfully for several years to 
keep the military recruitment rules out of education bills, but couldn't win the 
battle this year, especially since bigger education issues were dominating the 
debate, Hunter said. Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, engineered 
the inclusion of the new language, said a Kennedy staffer. 
<P> ''All this provision does is provide military recruiters with the same access 
to directory information that colleges currently enjoy,'' Kennedy said in a statement. 
<P> Civil libertarians are concerned about the rule nonetheless. 
<P> ''We opposed it primarily on privacy grounds, that students or parents should 
be able to control access to directory information, such as names, addresses, 
ages,'' said Christopher Anders, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties 
Union. ''That information shouldn't be sent out to military recruiters unless 
parents want it sent out.'' 
<P> Under federal privacy laws, schools generally must have written permission 
from parents or students to release any information about a student's education 
record, according to the Education Department. Exceptions include handing records 
over to a transfer school, to law enforcement in some cases, and to officials 
who need the information in cases of health or safety emergencies. 
<P> Schools may release what is called ''directory information,'' such as names, 
addresses, phone numbers, and date and place of birth, but they must also give 
parents the option of refusing disclosure of their child's information. Schools 
can decide on their own whether to provide the directory information to outside 
individuals or organizations. 
<P> The difference under the new rule is that schools will not have the discretion 
to refuse to provide such information to the military; they must provide the information 
to recruiters and allow them on campus at the Pentagon's request. 
<P> Groups such as the American Friends Service Committee and the Central Committee 
for Conscientious Objectors, an antimilitary draft organization, have been fielding 
complaints about the new rules, but are not sure whether they can successfully 
challenge them, especially in the environment created by the Sept. 11, 2001, terror 
attacks. Analysts are looking at whether the rules violate existing privacy law, 
said Oscar Castro, an AFSC official. 
<P> Jill Wynns, president of the San Francisco Board of Education, said the board's 
attorneys are looking at the law to see whether the Bay Area school system can 
keep any part of its current written policy, which prohibits military recruiters 
from coming on campus and bars the release of any student information to military 
recruiters ''or anyone who asks for it.'' 
<P> ''We are very upfront about being biased in favor of higher education. We're 
telling our kids, `go to college, go to college,''' said Wynns, adding that schools 
do not allow businesses to recruit on campuses, either. The military has not yet 
asked for students' contact information, but recruiters have demanded and recently 
been given access to San Francisco high schools for the first time in 12 years, 
she said.
