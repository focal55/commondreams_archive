<p>SOUTHERN DEMILITARIZED ZONE, Iraq -- On the "Highway of Death," 11 miles north 
of the Kuwait border, a collection of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other 
military vehicles are rusting in the desert.</p>
<p>They also are radiating nuclear energy.</p>
<p>In 1991, the United States and its Persian Gulf War allies blasted the vehicles 
with armor-piercing shells made of depleted uranium -- the first time such weapons 
had been used in warfare -- as the Iraqis retreated from Kuwait. The devastating 
results gave the highway its name. </p>

Today, nearly 12 years after the use of the super-tough weapons was credited with 
bringing the war to a swift conclusion, the battlefield remains a radioactive 
toxic wasteland -- and depleted uranium munitions remain a mystery. </p> 
<p>Although the Pentagon has sent mixed signals about the effects of depleted 
uranium, Iraqi doctors believe that it is responsible for a significant increase 
in cancer and birth defects in the region. Many researchers outside Iraq, and 
several U.S. veterans organizations, agree; they also suspect depleted uranium 
of playing a role in Gulf War Syndrome, the still-unexplained malady that has 
plagued hundreds of thousands of Gulf War veterans.</p>
<p>Depleted uranium is a problem in other former war zones as well. Yesterday, 
U.N. experts said they found radioactive hot spots in Bosnia resulting from the 
use of depleted uranium during NATO air strikes in 1995.</p>
<p>With another war in Iraq perhaps imminent, scientists and others are concerned 
that the side effects of depleted uranium munitions -- still a major part of the 
U.S. arsenal -- will cause serious illnesses or deaths in a new generation of 
U.S. soldiers as well as Iraqis. </p>
<p><b><B>THE DANGERS</b></b></p>
<p>Depleted uranium, known as DU, is a highly dense metal that is the byproduct 
of the process during which fissionable uranium used to manufacture nuclear bombs 
and reactor fuel is separated from natural uranium. DU remains radioactive for 
about 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p>Uranium, a weakly radioactive element, occurs naturally in soil and water everywhere 
on Earth, but mainly in trace quantities. Humans ingest it daily in minute quantities.</p>
<p>DU shell holes in the vehicles along the Highway of Death are 1,000 times more 
radioactive than background radiation, according to Geiger counter readings done 
for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer by Dr. Khajak Vartaanian, a nuclear medicine 
expert from the Iraq Department of Radiation Protection in Basra, and Col. Amal 
Kassim of the Iraqi navy. </p>
<p>The desert around the vehicles was 100 times more radioactive than background 
radiation; Basra, a city of 1 million people, some 125 miles away, registered 
only slightly above background radiation level. </p>
<p>But the radioactivity is only one concern about DU munitions.</p>
<p>A second, potentially more serious hazard is created when a DU round hits its 
target. As much as 70 percent of the projectile can burn up on impact, creating 
a firestorm of ceramic DU oxide particles. The residue of this firestorm is an 
extremely fine ceramic uranium dust that can be spread by the wind, inhaled and 
absorbed into the human body and absorbed by plants and animals, becoming part 
of the food chain.</p>
<p>Once lodged in the soil, the munitions can pollute the environment and create 
up to a hundredfold increase in uranium levels in ground water, according to the 
U.N. Environmental Program.</p>
<p>Studies show it can remain in human organs for years. </p>

The U.S. Army acknowledges the hazards in a training manual, in which it requires 
that anyone who comes within 25 meters of any DU-contaminated equipment or terrain 
wear respiratory and skin protection, and states that "contamination will make 
food and water unsafe for consumption."</p> 
<p>Just six months before the Gulf War, the Army released a report on DU predicting 
that large amounts of DU dust could be inhaled by soldiers and civilians during 
and after combat. </p>
<p>Infantry were identified as potentially receiving the highest exposures, and 
the expected health outcomes included cancers and kidney problems. </p>
<p>The report also warned that public knowledge of the health and environmental 
effects of depleted uranium could lead to efforts to ban DU munitions.</p>
<p>But today the Pentagon plays down the effects. Officials refer queries on DU 
munitions to the latest government report on the subject, last updated on Dec. 
13, 2000, which said DU is "40 percent less radioactive than natural uranium." 
</p>
<p>The report also said, "Gulf War exposures to depleted uranium (DU) have not 
to date produced any observable adverse health effects attributable to DU's chemical 
toxicity or low-level radiation. . . ."</p>
<p>In response to written queries, the Defense Department said, "The U.S. Military 
Services use DU munitions because of DU's superior lethality against armor and 
other hard targets." </p>
<p>It said DU munitions are "war reserve munitions; that is, used for combat and 
not fired for training purposes," with the exception that DU munitions may be 
fired at sea for weapon calibration purposes. </p>
<p>In addition to Iraq and Bosnia, DU munitions were used in Kosovo and Serbia 
in 1999. </p>
<p>Also in 1999, a United Nations subcommission considered DU hazardous enough 
to call for an initiative banning its use worldwide. The initiative has remained 
in committee, blocked primarily by the United States, according to Karen Parker, 
a lawyer with the International Educational Development/Humanitarian Law Project, 
which has consultative status at the United Nations.</p>
<p>Parker, who first raised the DU issue in the United Nations in 1996, contends 
that DU "violates the existing law and customs of war."</p>
<p>She said there are four rules derived from all of humanitarian law regarding 
weapons:</p>
<p>
<li>Weapons may only be used in the legal field of battle, defined as legal military 
targets of the enemy in war. Weapons may not have an adverse effect off the legal 
field of battle.</p> 
<p>
<li>Weapons can only be used for the duration of an armed conflict. A weapon that 
is used or continues to act after the war is over violates this criterion.</p> 
<p>
<li>Weapons may not be unduly inhumane.</p> 
<p>
<li>Weapons may not have an unduly negative effect on the natural environment.</p> 
<p>"Depleted uranium fails all four of these rules," Parker said last week.</p>
<p>On Oct. 17, 2001, Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., introduced a bill calling for 
"the suspension of the use, sale, development, production, testing, and export 
of depleted uranium munitions pending the outcome of certain studies of the health 
effects of such munitions. . . ."</p>
<p>More than a year later, the bill -- co-sponsored by Reps. Anibal Acevedo-Vila, 
Puerto Rico; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio; Barbara Lee, D-Ca.; 
and Jim McDermott, D-Wash. -- remains in committee awaiting comment from the Defense 
Department. </p>

Gulf War veterans faced a wide array of potentially toxic materials during the 
war: smoke from oil and chemical fires, insecticides, pesticides, vaccinations 
and DU. </p> 
<p>Of the 696,778 troops who served during the recognized conflict phase (1990-1991) 
of the Gulf War, at least 20,6861 have applied for VA medical benefits. As of 
May 2002, 159,238 veterans have been awarded service-connected disability by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs for health effects collectively known as the Gulf 
War Syndrome. </p>
<p>There have been many studies on Gulf War Syndrome over the years, as well as 
on possible long-term health hazards of DU munitions. Most have been inconclusive. 
But some researchers said the previous studies on DU, conducted by groups and 
agencies ranging from the World Health Organization to the Rand Corp. to the investigative 
arm of Congress, weren't looking in the right place -- at the effects of inhaled 
DU. </p>
<p>Dr. Asaf Durakovic, director of the private, non-profit Uranium Medical Research 
Centre in Canada and the United States, and center research associates Patricia 
Horan and Leonard Dietz, published a unique study in the August issue of Military 
Medicine medical journal. </p>
<p>The study is believed to be the first to look at inhaled DU among Gulf War 
veterans, using the ultrasensitive technique of thermal ionization mass spectrometry, 
which enabled them to easily distinguish between natural uranium and DU. </p>
<p>The study, which examined British, Canadian and U.S. veterans, all suffering 
typical Gulf War Syndrome ailments, found that, nine years after the war, 14 of 
27 veterans studied had DU in their urine. DU also was found in the lung and bone 
of a deceased Gulf War veteran. </p>
<p>That no governmental study has been done on inhaled DU "amounts to a massive 
malpractice," Dietz said in an interview last week. </p>
<p><b><B>THE ACTIVIST</b></b></p>
<p>Dr. Doug Rokke was an Army health physicist assigned in 1991 to the command 
staff of the 12th Preventive Medicine Command and 3rd U.S. Army Medical Command 
headquarters. Rokke was recalled to active duty 20 years after serving in Vietnam, 
from his research job with the University of Illinois Physics Department, and 
sent to the Gulf to take charge of the DU cleanup operation. </p>
<p>Today, in poor health, he has become an outspoken opponent of the use of DU 
munitions.</p>
<p>"DU is the stuff of nightmares," said Rokke, who said he has reactive airway 
disease, neurological damage, cataracts and kidney problems, and receives a 40 
percent disability payment from the government. He blames his health problems 
on exposure to DU. </p>
<p>Rokke and his primary team of about 100 performed their cleanup task without 
any specialized training or protective gear. Today, Rokke said, at least 30 members 
of the team are dead, and most of the others -- including Rokke -- have serious 
health problems.</p>
<p>Rokke said: "Verified adverse health effects from personal experience, physicians 
and from personal reports from individuals with known DU exposures include reactive 
airway disease, neurological abnormalities, kidney stones and chronic kidney pain, 
rashes, vision degradation and night vision losses, lymphoma, various forms of 
skin and organ cancer, neuropsychological disorders, uranium in semen, sexual 
dysfunction and birth defects in offspring.</p>
<p>"This whole thing is a crime against God and humanity." </p>
<p>Speaking from his home in Rantoul, Ill., where he works as a substitute high 
school science teacher, Rokke said, "When we went to the Gulf, we were all really 
healthy, and we got trashed."</p>
<p>Rokke, an Army Reserve major who describes himself as "a patriot to the right 
of Rush Limbaugh," said hearing the latest Pentagon statements on DU is especially 
frustrating now that another war against Iraq appears likely. </p>
<p>"Since 1991, numerous U.S. Department of Defense reports have said that the 
consequences of DU were unknown," Rokke said. "That is a lie. We warned them in 
1991 after the Gulf War, but because of liability issues, they continue to ignore 
the problem." Rokke worked until 1996 for the military, developing DU training 
and management procedures. The procedures were ignored, he said.</p>
<p>"Their arrogance is beyond comprehension," he said. "We have spread radioactive 
waste all over the place and refused medical treatment to people . . . it's all 
arrogance.</p>
<p>"DU is a snapshot of technology gone crazy."</p>
<p><b><B>BIRTH DEFECTS IN IRAQ</b></b></p>
<p>At the Saddam Teaching Hospital in Basra, Dr. Jawad Al-Ali, a British-trained 
oncologist, displays, in four gaily colored photo albums, what he says are actual 
snapshots of the nightmares.</p>
<p>The photos represent the surge in birth defects -- in 1989 there were 11 per 
100,000 births; in 2001 there were 116 per 100,000 births -- that even before 
they heard about DU, had doctors in southern Iraq making comparisons to the birth 
defects that followed the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in WWII.</p>
<p>There were photos of infants born without brains, with their internal organs 
outside their bodies, without sexual organs, without spines, and the list of deformities 
went on and on. There also were photos of cancer patients.</p>
<p>Cancer has increased dramatically in southern Iraq. In 1988, 34 people died 
of cancer; in 1998, 450 died of cancer; in 2001 there were 603 cancer deaths.</p>
<p>On a tour of one ward of the hospital, doctors pointed out boys and girls who 
were suffering from leukemia. Most of the children die, the doctors said, because 
there are insufficient drugs available for their treatment.</p>
<p>There was one notable exception, a young boy whose family was able to buy the 
expensive drugs on the black market.</p>
<p>Al-Ali said it defies logic to absolve DU of blame when veterans of the Gulf 
War and of the fighting in the Balkans share common illnesses with children in 
southern Iraq.</p>
<p>"The cause of all of these cancers and deformities remains theoretical because 
we can't confirm the presence of uranium in tissue or urine with the equipment 
we have," said Al-Ali. "And because of the sanctions, we can't get the equipment 
we need."
