Randa Tawadros watches her 2-year-old son grow thinner. He refuses to eat and has lost three pounds, dropping down to 26 pounds. ''He looks like a kid from one of the commercials for `feed the hungry,''' Tawadros said. Her 7-month-old daughter cries all the time.

</font>At 6 p.m., like clockwork, her husband, Raouf Mankaryous used to arrive home from work and everything stopped. ''We would drop everything and all run to the door and give him hugs,'' she said. But the children's father hasn't been home in nearly three months.
<P>He is in prison in Cranston, R.I., with dozens of other illegal immigrants awaiting deportation. While Mankaryous, an electrical engineer, awaits an uncertain future, the bills at home are piling up. Tawadros struggles, with the help of family, to pay the mortgage on their home in Ayer. She lost the family's health insurance. And just Tuesday another loved one - her cousin - was arrested by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents.</P>
<P>Like many immigrant families who have arrived from the Middle East seeking refuge from persecution, Tawadros's family members represent a spectrum of immigration statuses: many are naturalized citizens, her children are American-born, some are residents with green cards, and a few are undocumented.</P>
<P>As the INS steps up its effort to round up illegal immigrants who've been previously ordered deported, it is forcing women with children into a difficult bind: Do they stay in America with parents and sisters and their children? Or do they leave with their husbands?</P>
<P>Returning would be dangerous for her children, who, like her husband and herself, are Coptic Christians. According to the United Nations and Amnesty International, Coptic Christians are constantly being persecuted by Islamic extremists who have been known to rape, torture, and murder them just because of their religious affiliation.</P>
<P>Because those arrested by INS are jailed until they are deported, it has taken away breadwinners, leaving their wives and children scrambling to pay bills.</P>
<P>''It's extremely hard,'' said Tawadros, 30. ''We lost his income. I have family helping out, but I feel embarrassed. This is the first time I've had to ask for help. I could live without heat or food but the children can't.''</P>
<P>It has also created an emotional crisis within her home: Her 2-year-old son, Robear, is so depressed he doesn't want to eat. Her 7-month-old daughter, Reanna Marie, cries constantly. </P>
<P>INS officials say they are mindful that the arrest of undocumented immigrants can be hard on families, and they have tried to ease the impacts by rarely detaining women who are caring for young children. However, INS officials say they have a job to do.</P>
<P>''I can understand there will be hardship as a result of family separation, but we are still obligated to enforce the immigration judge's order of deportation,'' said Denis Riordan, acting district director of the Boston office of INS.</P>
<P>Moreover, Riordan said the people who are being arrested have known for a long time that they were here illegally since they have already been ordered deported once.</P>
<P>''It was their decision not to honor the order of deportation and there are consequences that come with that,'' he said.</P>
<P>It's unclear how many ''absconders'' - illegal immigrants who have been previously ordered deported - are being detained in prison. According to the INS, about 400 people around the country have been arrested so far, with the eventual goal of deporting 300,000 absconders. Phase one is to deport people who arrived from countries with ties to the Al Qaeda organization - regardless of whether there is any reason to believe they are connected to a terrorist cell.</P>
<P>It's also unclear if the INS will begin a similar removal process for the estimated 10 million illegal immigrants living in the country. Social Security offices have been checking their files for suspicious individuals who have tried to obtain Social Security cards even though they may not be documented.</P>
<P>Yesterday, Tawadros visited her husband at the Intake Service Center in Cranston. He was wearing the same blue cotton uniform as the inmates - those who have committed violent felonies. Attached to his shirt was a photo ID tag emblazoned ''Offender.''</P>
<P>Harvey Kaplan, one of Boston's leading immigration attorneys, said the Board of Immigration Appeals has agreed to reconsider his case. They issued a stay on his motion to reopen. Kaplan hopes that will amount to a reversal on their decision, which would grant him asylum.</P>
<P>''There's no timetable on the hearing date. But priority is given to those in detention,'' Kaplan said. He said it's ironic that those being deported are those whose lives are in danger if they return.</P>
<P>Kaplan said US Attorney General John Ashcroft's hard-line approach means there's little possibility that illegal immigrants seeking asylum can stay. </P>
<P>''Even if you have a good case, there's a level of doom,'' Kaplan said.</P>
