<p> BOGOTA - Lawmakers, human rights defenders and Colombia's attorney-general's 
office urged the government Tuesday to repeal a decision to invoke a clause that 
would allow perpetrators of war crimes to remain outside the jurisdiction of the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) for seven years.
<p> The government of Andr&#233;s Pastrana, President Alvaro Uribe's predecessor, 
acted ''behind the public's back'' by invoking Article 124 of the Rome Statute 
- the treaty that created the ICC - said Senator Jimmy Chamorro, one of the driving 
forces behind the move to ratify the treaty. 
<p> The ICC, which Colombia has ratified, has jurisdiction over genocide, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity whenever national courts are not able or willing 
to prosecute alleged perpetrators. 
<p> But Article 124 allows signatory countries to ''declare that, for a period 
of seven years after the entry into force of this statute for the state concerned, 
it does not accept the jurisdiction of the court with respect to'' war crimes 
''alleged to have been committed by its nationals or in its territory.'' 
<p> Colombia invoked that clause on Aug 5, two days before Uribe was sworn in. 
The Rome Statute went into effect on Jul 1. 
<p> Chamorro said numerous war crimes that would fall under ICC jurisdiction are 
committed in Colombia, in the context of the four- decade civil war. 
<p> Parliamentary Deputy Gustavo Petro told IPS that taking refuge in Article 
124 is ''an act of cowardice,'' because it will benefit the organizations involved 
in the armed conflict, and extend for another seven years the impunity surrounding 
war crimes committed in this South American nation of 42 million. 
<p> Petro, a former member of the now-defunct insurgent group Movimiento 19 de 
abril, said the Colombian justice system ''has failed to bring to justice the 
war criminals who are active in our country, which is one of the reasons the progressive 
factions fought for'' ratification of the Rome Statute. 
<p> The ICC is a real and effective instrument that can fill the vacuum left by 
''the state's incapacity,'' and force the participants in Colombia's armed conflict 
to act in a ''more ethical and humane'' manner, said the legislator. 
<p> The civil war leaves a death toll of around 20 people a day, only five of 
whom are armed combatants, according to human rights organizations, which complain 
that impunity for such abuses remains the norm. 
<p> The most common war crimes committed in Colombia are massacres, hostage-taking, 
indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population, the employment of toxic, unconventional 
weapons, and the recruitment of minors. 
<p> Uribe should publicly clarify whether or not he will repeal the decision to 
invoke Article 124 of the Rome Statute, said Petro. Only if Colombia decides not 
to avail itself of the seven-year grace period can the ICC be effectively applied 
in Colombia, he added. 
<p> The president's office issued a communique Monday reporting that the government 
would evaluate the issue, and clarifying that the decision to invoke Article 124 
was not irreversible. 
<p> The statement indicated that the new government had nothing to do with the 
Pastrana administration's decision. But it also asserted that the seven-year period 
in question would not imply that perpetrators of war crimes would go unpunished. 
<p> Government peace commissioner Luis Restrepo said he was inclined towards maintaining 
Pastrana's position, in order to facilitate eventual peace talks with the rebels. 
<p> But in a letter addressed to Uribe, attorney-general Edgardo Maya said that 
''if the government has any reason to maintain the seven-year transition period, 
it should clearly explain to the country its reasons for doing so.'' 
<p> If the Colombian state decides to take refuge in Article 124, it will be sending 
''the mistaken message'' that it ''does not want the ICC to learn about the grave 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the 
context of the armed conflict'' over the next seven years, argued Maya. 
<p> Manuel Cepeda, who sits on the Constitutional Court, said Colombia's laws 
provide for measures like amnesties and pardons, that can be declared in the case 
of peace talks with the irregular armed groups. 
<p> Cepeda said the Constitutional Court had informed Pastrana that the jurisdiction 
of the ICC over war crimes committed in Colombia would not be incompatible with 
any amnesty or pardon that ''respects the constitution and the provisions and 
norms of international law.'' 
<p> Senator Jaime Dur&#225;n said that if the government maintains ''the unpatriotic 
position taken by ex-president Pastrana, Congress should promote a censure motion,'' 
because it would amount to ''giving into blackmail from the United States.'' 
<p> According to Dur&#225;n, Washington is applying pressure to countries over 
which it has a strong influence, with a view to weakening the ICC. 
<p> The Foreign Ministry is studying a draft of a bilateral treaty proposed by 
Washington according to which U.S. troops and advisers in Colombia who commit 
crimes against humanity could not be tried by the ICC.
