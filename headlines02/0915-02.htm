</table>The decision to delete the chapter on climate change was made by top officials 
at the Environmental Protection Agency with White House approval, White House 
officials said.</P>
<P> "Some people at pretty high levels in my organization were saying, `Take it 
out,' " said an E.P.A. official outside Washington who helped prepare the report. 
Others at the agency confirmed his account.</P>
<P> Agency officials say the decision was made for two reasons: the agency has 
issued two other reports on climate this year, and the annual report is mainly 
meant to track pollutants that directly threaten people or ecosystems — substances 
like lead, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain.</P>
<P> The report, released early this month, is an overview intended for the public 
that draws on more detailed E.P.A. data on air pollution trends. Most emissions 
have been sharply reduced in the last decade, but not carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping 
gas that most scientists say is the main contributor to global warming. Most carbon 
dioxide comes from burning fossil fuels.</P>
<P> Industry lobbyists are praising the decision. Coal, oil and car companies 
say carbon dioxide, which occurs naturally, should not be labeled a pollutant. 
But environmental groups say the omission reflects the administration's close 
ties with industry.</P>
<P> "White House censors may have made global warming disappear from this report, 
but that won't make it disappear as a serious threat to our environment," said 
Jeremy Symons, an authority on climate policy at the National Wildlife Federation.</P>
<P> Mr. Bush said last year that carbon dioxide appeared to be linked to rising 
temperatures, and he has since said that voluntary measures should be taken to 
slow emissions but that the evidence is not yet clear enough to require reductions.</P>
<P> The new report, "Latest Findings on National Air Quality: 2001 Status and 
Trends," is online, with those from previous years, at: epa.gov/airtrends/reports.html.</P>
<P> Published since the 1970's, the reports have focused on air pollution restricted 
under the Clean Air Act as directly harming human health or ecosystems. But starting 
in 1996, the report also included sections on emissions that affect the global 
atmosphere, including chemicals that damage the ozone layer and carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases.</P>
<P> The latest report has a section on the ozone-depleting chemicals, which are 
rapidly being reduced under the 15-year-old Montreal Protocol. But there is no 
section on climate change. </P>
<P> Global warming is mentioned twice: once in a note in fine print at the bottom 
of the table of contents, listing agency Web sites with climate data, and once 
in a paragraph that refers, apparently by mistake, to the omitted section on climate.</P>
<P> "Although the primary focus of this report is on national air pollution," 
the paragraph says, "global air pollution issues such as destruction of the stratospheric 
ozone layer and the effect of global warming on the earth's climate are major 
concerns and are also discussed."</P>
<P> Environmental and conservative groups have accused the administration of sowing 
confusion on the climate issue. </P>
<P> In late May, the White House approved a climate report that was then submitted 
by the State Department to the United Nations, though it contained far more dire 
projections of harm from global warming than Mr. Bush had publicly accepted. The 
president quickly distanced himself from the report, saying it was "put out by 
the bureaucracy." New copies of the report have been changed to emphasize scientific 
uncertainty about the effects of global warming. Some officials at the E.P.A. 
said the handling of that State Department report heightened concern about climate 
documents, prompting the changes in the new report. </P>
<P> "There's a complete paranoia about anything on climate, and everything has 
to be reviewed widely," an agency official said.</P>
<P> Other officials said the report was changed to avoid redundancy with earlier 
documents and to draw a line between carbon dioxide and pollutants that fall under 
air quality rules. </P>
<P> The annual report focuses on pollutants "that pose a local and regional threat 
to human health and the environment," said Joe Martyak, a spokesman for the agency. 
"The whole issue of climate change doesn't fall under that category."</P>
<P> The change in the document was welcomed by Myron Ebell, an authority on climate 
policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. </P>
<P> "After such a long string of disasters on climate, this is the first glimmer 
of good news," he said. "If they have now gotten clear with the E.P.A. that they're 
not in the business of regulating CO2, that's a hopeful sign."</p> </P>
