When Noam Chomsky takes the stage today at the University of San 
Francisco to give a speech titled "Human Rights: Global Change and Continuity,
" he'll be greeted by an audience that sees him as the antidote to U.S. 
leaders who back the military campaign in Afghanistan and want to expand the 
war on terrorism to Iraq and other countries.

</table>Chomsky, the noted MIT linguistics professor who is best known for his 
scathing critiques of U.S. foreign policy, says the United States itself was 
practicing terrorism when it bombed Afghanistan and forced the Taliban from 
power. And it was terrorism, Chomsky says, when President Bush -- without 
publicly providing conclusive proof, and without going to an international 
court of law -- decided he wanted Osama bin Laden "dead or alive."
<P>"By the U.S. definition, those are textbook illustrations of international 
terrorism, which is the use of force or violence to attain political ends 
(and) the targeting of civilians through intimidation and fear," Chomsky said 
in a weekend phone interview from his Massachusetts home, before flying to the 
Bay Area to make a weeklong series of talks.
<P>Since Sept. 11, Chomsky has been deluged with requests to speak at 
universities, fund-raisers and public forums. He published a best-selling book, "9-11," which explains -- in a series of interviews with journalists -- his 
view that the United States is "a leading terrorist state" that circumvents 
international law and wrongfully supports murderous conditions around the 
world, whether it's in Iraq, the Palestinian territories, Nicaragua or 
Indonesia.
<P>"Right now, the United States is asking Turkey to become the international 
military force in Afghanistan," said Chomsky. "Well, what's Turkey? In the 
1990s, funded almost completely by the Clinton administration, atrocities 
increased (in Kurdish areas of Turkey) -- to the point that (up to 3 million) 
refugees were driven out and maybe 50,000 people were killed and thousands of 
villages were destroyed. That's U.S. terrorism in the 1990s. I'm not talking 
about ancient history. And now Turkey is being asked to supervise the 'war on 
terrorism?' If some Martian observer were looking at this, he'd crack up in 
ridicule."
<P>Critics say Chomsky is reflexively anti-American, and publications as 
varied as the New Republic and the Weekly Standard have derided his post-Sept. 
11 comments, especially remarks Chomsky made last November in Pakistan's 
capital, when he reportedly told an audience, "The coalition forces are making 
plans to further destroy the hunger-stricken country (of Afghanistan). The 
consequences of their crimes will never be known and they are quite confident 
about that."
<P>Under the title of "Paging Jane Fonda," the New Republic wrote that Chomsky 
"appeared in Islamabad to peddle his by now banal theories of American 
malfeasance" and that, "At the end of his speech, the audience of 1,500 gave 
Chomsky a standing ovation. He'd doubtless receive a similarly warm reception 
in Kandahar."
<P>Chomsky dismisses his critics as "commissars," saying he takes their put-
downs "for granted. It's been done throughout history. How were dissidents 
treated in the Soviet Union? Let's look at the First World War. The first 
thing that happened as the war opened was that 93 leading German intellectuals 
issued a proclamation requesting that intellectuals all over the world support 
Germany's noble war effort. On the Anglo-American side, exactly the same thing 
happened. There were a couple of dissidents, like (author and philosopher) 
Bertrand Russell and (Socialist presidential candidate) Eugene Debs in the 
United States -- and, yes, they ended up in jail."
<P>His speech in Islamabad, Chomsky points out, was arranged by Pakistan's 
Eqbal Ahmad Foundation, "and Eqbal Ahmad was the leading opponent of religious 
fundamentalism and nuclear armament in Pakistan. He was also the leading 
proponent of democracy. That's who I was speaking for -- for the group of 
people who are radically opposed to Islamic fundamentalism. The liberal press 
(in the United States) presented it as if I was somehow giving a pro-Taliban 
speech."
<P>Tomorrow and Wednesday, Chomsky will give speeches on linguistics at UC 
Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall. Then he'll talk Thursday night at the Berkeley 
Community Theatre in a benefit for the Middle East Children's Alliance, and 
Friday night at the Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto in a sold-out discussion 
sponsored by the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center. Chomsky's Thursday night 
speech is titled "Middle East Peace in a 9-11 World," and his Friday night 
speech is titled "Peering Into the Abyss of the Future." All of his talks, 
including today's, will touch on Afghanistan and a war against terrorism that 
he says is morally unfair and misdirected.
<P>Since Sept. 11, Chomsky says, his speeches have been more heavily attended 
than ever, and his views have been disseminated more than ever.
<P>"It's not just me, incidentally," Chomsky said. "It's everybody. There's 
probably been more openness and dissent now than at any time in modern history.
