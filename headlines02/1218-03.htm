</table></font>Although the challenge of intercepting incoming missiles in midflight often is likened to hitting a bullet with a bullet, bullets travel slowly compared to the missiles the new system will attempt to hit at speeds of about 15,000 miles per hour.
<p> 

To destroy those targets, Bush's initial system will use space-based sensors to detect missile launches, ground-based radar to track them and about 10 interceptor missiles based in Alaska. In theory, once the radar has guided an interceptor to its target, the interceptor homes in using infrared sensors and collides with the missile head-on--a strategy the military calls "hit to kill."
<p> So far, tests of that approach have been mixed: Since 1999, three of the eight U.S. tests of "hit to kill" interceptors have failed, including the most recent failure last week.<p> Critics of missile defense also contend that such tests are not realistic and do not take account of some low-tech measures an enemy could take to foil the system.<p> For example, some experts say that if an incoming warhead released small, jack-shaped decoys made of ordinary wire, the radar in Alaska could not distinguish that chaff from the target.<p> "The whole system could be paralyzed by the simplest methods you can imagine," said Theodore Postol, an arms-control expert and missile defense critic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<p> "You can build decoys weighing literally ounces, deploy hundreds or thousands of them, and the radar would be saturated," Postol said.<p> The military's tests have shown that in controlled situations, the "hit to kill" technique can work--an impressive feat, many experts say. And some of the tests were successful despite the deployment of countermeasures such as balloons that could have thrown off the interceptor's infrared equipment.<p> Still, critics say the tests have not fully simulated what a determined enemy would try to overcome a missile defense, and that is one of the program's greatest challenges.<p> Boosters of missile defense say one solution may be to provide a three-layered defense against incoming missiles: targeting them as they are launching, later on in midflight and during their final descent. The Alaskan interceptors announced by Bush on Tuesday would seek out warheads only in midflight.<p> Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, told the television program "Frontline" in October that he believes the decoy issue can be solved.<p> "It's a problem we worry about all the time," Kadish said. "That's why we're building a multilayered approach."<p> One way to target missiles in their final phase might be with the latest version of the Patriot anti-missile system, called PAC-3. Like the original Patriot used in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the new version would be used in metropolitan areas to hit missiles as they were nearing the ground.<p> The PAC-3 has been successful in fewer than half of tests performed by the Army this year. Philip Coyle, chief weapons tester at the Pentagon under President Bill Clinton, wrote last May in the publication Arms Control Today that it would be at least a decade before the PAC-3 system could be integrated into a national missile defense.<p> A major puzzle facing designers of the PAC-3 and the new Alaska-based system will be how to track and stop missiles tumbling end-over-end in wobbly trajectories.<p> Most precision warheads used by the U.S. and other nuclear powers spin like footballs as they move, making for steady, predictable paths and pinpoint accuracy. Iraq's Scud missiles don't use such spin-stabilization but rather tumble in ways that are difficult for anti-missile systems to track.<p> Tests of national missile defense systems have focused on spin-stabilized warheads, which some experts say are easier to identify in midflight than the tumbling warheads potential adversaries such as North Korea would be likely to use.<p> Postol said attacking nations could use other cheap measures to foil an anti-missile system, such as wrapping warheads in plastic bags filled with foam and radar-absorbing materials; the bag would burn up during re-entry but could fool radar during the crucial midflight phase.<p> Tricking the interceptor's infrared sensors with balloon decoys would be nearly as easy, Postol said.<p>
