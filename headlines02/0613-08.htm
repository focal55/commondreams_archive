<p> To those who live there, it is as if the rich have stolen the rain. For more 
than 30 years, the Sahel region of Africa has suffered the longest sustained droughts 
in the world. In some places, rainfall has fallen by between 20 and 50 per cent.</p>
<p>As a consequence, crops have failed on a huge scale; in the worst years, between 
1972 and 1975 and between 1984 and 1985, up to a million people starved to death.</p>
<p>However, for President George Bush, who has only recently accepted that global 
warming and climate change are the result of human influences &#150; such as the 
burning of fossil fuels &#150; the idea of a cause involving the developed world 
is unwelcome.</p>
<p>But new research indicates that pollution from factories and power stations, 
especially in North America and Europe, has exacerbated drought in countries south 
of the Sahara.</p>
<p>Researchers have little doubt that the two are connected and also that the 
effect of the drought will last long after any clean-up.</p>
<p>There are also warnings that growing industrialization in India and China is 
likely to create the same problems on the Indian subcontinent &#150; with potentially 
disastrous effects for millions more people.</p>
<p>According to a report in <i>New Scientist </i>magazine today, climate modeling 
studies by scientists in Australia and Canada have fingered the clouds of sulphur 
poured out by vehicles and power stations when they burn fossil fuels for pushing 
the Saharan rain-belt south.</p>
<p>The effect is complex, which is why it has only just emerged from the analyses. 
<i>New Scientist</i> explains that Leon Rotstayn of CSIRO, the national research 
agency in Australia, and Ulrike Lohmann, of Dalhousie University, in Halifax, 
Nova Scotia, created a computer model that simulated the interactions between 
sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants and other sources and cloud.</p>
<p>A key element here is that those emissions create huge volumes of "aerosols" 
&#150; tiny particles about one micrometer across that can remain floating in 
the atmosphere for days. They are very efficient at scattering light and forming 
clouds, which reflect sunlight; both effects tend to cool the atmosphere and the 
Earth below.</p>
<p>The vast amount of aerosols produced especially in the 1980s lingered over 
the northern hemisphere and tended to cool it down, say the researchers. But it 
is the final step &#150; to the shifting fortunes of the rain clouds that should 
linger over the Sahel &#150; which is the subtle one.</p>
<p>David Roberts, the head of the aerosol modeling group at the Meteorological 
Office's Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, said: "It's an effect 
of the thermal balance between the two hemispheres. There has to be a rough balance 
between the north and south hemispheres &#150; you can't have spare energy in 
one place or the other. If the Earth was completely symmetrical, then the point 
of thermal equilibrium, where the total energy on either side of a line was equal, 
would be the Equator. But because the Northern hemisphere isn't the same as the 
south [because of the vast energy reservoir of the Pacific, which retains energy 
more efficiently than land] we find that the Northern hemisphere is warmer than 
the South."</p>
<p>However, aerosol-driven cooling of the Northern hemisphere pushes that point 
of thermal equilibrium south &#150; and with it go the rain clouds that people 
depend on for their crops in the Sahel.</p>
<p>The historical evidence tends to back up the findings.</p>
<p>One key change that the researchers point to is that in the 1980s, improvements 
in emission laws meant that sulphur emissions in particular dropped &#150; because 
they were blamed for acid rain, which was noticed far more keenly in the industrialized 
countries than droughts in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Dr Rotstayn and Professor Lohmann said that droughts have become less severe 
during the past few years. But that does not mean that they have disappeared. 
Far from it; the whole of southern Africa is facing a "regional food crisis", 
according to a recent report that notes that a total of six countries in southern 
Africa have roughly 11 million people who need emergency food assistance. Ironically, 
the note came from the United States Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>But the cleaning of the air in the US and Europe (and the closure through economic 
failure of many of the worst polluters in eastern Europe) does not mean that the 
threat is over. If anything, it could get worse.</p>
<p>Although Dr Roberts says he is "cautious" about taking the interpretation of 
the link between aerosols in the northern hemisphere and the weather in the Sahel 
as gospel, he says that if it is correct, then there are other areas around the 
globe that could be threatened by a new wave of fossil-fuel burning.</p>
<p>"The emissions from China and India are rising," he said yesterday. "And that 
could affect, for example, the monsoon season in India, which would have an important 
regional impact. If it weakens the monsoon, then that would be a concern. The 
subcontinent is very dependent on it; it would be of serious concern to them if 
that moved. But the aerosols would alter the balance between north and south in 
the same way."</p>
<p>What is unclear is how the world would cope with change like that. In the Sahel, 
drought is becoming ingrained: without water, vegetation dies, and the the dry 
land and the dust thrown up from it into the atmosphere both reflect heat, keeping 
the thermal equilibrium point in its southerly place. And when it does rain, the 
lack of plant life means that water just runs away.</p>
<p>"It's a vicious cycle, a land degradation issue," Habiba Gitay, an ecologist 
who worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told <i>New Scientist</i>. 
And the blame for starting the cycle turning appears to lie with the developed 
world. The problem, though, is that nobody knows quite how to stop it and bring 
back the rain to the places that need it.</p>
<p>Some people think that the first signs of the thermal changes caused by the 
increasing industrialization of the developing countries are already being seen. 
In a worrying echo of the situation in the Sahel, northern China has had unusually 
dry summers in the past few years, note<i>s New Scientist</i> &#150; while the 
south has had a notably wet time.</p>
<p>The new theory about the connection between aerosols and rainfall also means 
that the world will have to expand the sophistication of its understanding of 
climate change. Because aerosols cool the Earth, it had been thought that they 
might in some way be beneficial in easing the warming caused by carbon dioxide. 
But now it can be seen that they also contribute to changing weather patterns 
in ways that are potentially disastrous for millions of people, as surely as rising 
sea levels caused by simple global warming. </p>
