<p>SAN FRANCISCO 2, ECUADOR  --
Walking along a dirt trail in the heart of the Amazon rain forest, 
subsistence farmer Santiago Tanguila says life in this village on the 
Colombian border has always been difficult.
<P>But now, he says, pointing to trees with yellow, withered leaves, the 
village's 32 residents are facing a new challenge.

</font>In an attempt to kill coca leaf -- the raw material for cocaine -- 
Colombian planes are using a U.S.-manufactured herbicide near the border with 
Ecuador. The aerial spraying has caused widespread crop damage and illness 
because winds often blow the toxic liquid into Ecuador, according to 
government officials, environmental groups and local farmers such as Tanguila.
<P>About 10,000 Ecuadorans have been affected by the aerial spraying, 
according to the environmental group Ecological Action, based in Quito, 
Ecuador's capital.
<P>The fumigation effort is financed by Plan Colombia, a multibillion-dollar 
program, partially financed by the United States, to cut back cocaine 
production. The Colombians use RoundupUltra, a glyphosate-based herbicide 
manufactured by the U.S. company Monsanto, mixed with a locally made chemical 
that causes the poison to stick to the leaf.
<P>"This liquid covers everything," said Tanguila, who is president of the 
Indigenous Association of San Francisco 2. "It wrecks our agriculture. It 
affects everything we grow."
<P>Monsanto says RoundupUltra, which is used as a weed killer in the United 
States, is safe for humans and plants when properly applied. At worst, it 
could cause temporary eye and skin irritation, according to company 
spokeswoman Janice Armstrong. She declined to comment about the herbicide's 
use in the war on drugs.
<P>But residents of San Francisco 2 want the spraying stopped. In February, 
they filed a class action lawsuit for unspecified damages in Washington 
against the Dyn Corp., a Virginia firm responsible for the spraying.
<P>Company executives want the suit dismissed, arguing that U.S. courts should 
not be given jurisdiction and that the company is involved in a legal program 
authorized by the U.S. Congress. A judge is expected to rule within the next 
several weeks whether the case should proceed.
<P>"We have a strong case," said Terry Collingsworth, the village's lawyer and 
general counsel for the International Labor Rights Fund in Washington. "Plan 
Colombia was never designed to spray inside Ecuador."
<P>All Ecuadorans living within three miles of Colombia and 89 percent 
residing within six miles of the border have reported symptoms of herbicide 
poisoning such as respiratory problems, headaches, skin rashes and intestinal 
bleeding, according to Adolfo Maldonado, a Spanish doctor who helped prepare 
the study by Ecological Action. Farmers also say the spraying has killed their 
coffee, yucca and mango crops and polluted local water supplies.
<P>Many of the fumigation victims are Quichua Indians, the largest tribal 
group in Ecuador with some 110,000 members, some of whom live along the border.
<P>Down a dirt path, Quichua farmer Judith Rodriguez recalls the misty cloud 
of herbicide that hit her farm just a half-mile from the border.
<P>"I got sick with fever. I have body aches and intense headaches," she said. 
"I had rashes on my skin."
<P>The Colombian government insists that its planes have been instructed not 
to spray closer than six miles from the border. But such claims are disputed 
by dozens of Ecuadoran farmers in the border province of Sucumbios, one of the 
poorest provinces in Ecuador.
<P>Maximo Abad, the mayor of Nueva Loja, the provincial capital formerly 
called Lago Agrio, reports dozens of complaints from peasants who have been 
affected by aerial spraying. In addition to physical harm, there is the 
"psychological impact," he said.
<P>"The fumigation is done with airplanes guarded by helicopters. They are 
violating Ecuadoran airspace and scaring children."
<P>Ecuador's Ministry of Environment says it would like to conduct its own 
scientific study to determine the impact of spraying on agriculture and health.
<P>Ministry official Melania Yanez, however, says not all problems reported by 
farmers are caused by fumigation. Low coffee yields and smaller mangoes are 
more than likely not caused by herbicides, since toxins typically kill a plant 
outright, she says.
<P>But Yanez says the ministry remains concerned because of the "health 
symptoms reported by farmers are consistent with pesticide poisoning."
<P>Ecuadoran officials have asked their Colombian counterparts for a written 
guarantee that they will refrain from aerial spraying within six miles of the 
border. To date, the request has been refused.
<P>Meanwhile, Quichua farmers say they will continue to push for compensation 
from the United States.
<P>"We want them to pay us for our damaged crops and health problems," 
Tanguila said. "How else can we recoup our losses?"
