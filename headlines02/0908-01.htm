<p>BAGHDAD - Scott Ritter, a former U.N. arms inspector who rejects U.S. charges 
that Baghdad is developing weapons of mass destruction, said in Iraq Sunday it 
would be a "historical mistake" for Washington to attack.

</table></font>The U.S. national, who arrived Saturday on a visit he  arranged hoping to help stop any U.S.-led war, defied his  government to substantiate its claim that Baghdad was producing  prohibited weapons and posed a threat to its neighbors.<p>Ritter, who for seven years was a member of the U.N. body  in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons, urged Baghdad to let  U.N. weapons inspectors return without conditions.</span>
<P>"My country seems to be on the verge of making a historical  mistake," Ritter told Iraq's parliament, in reference to a  possible U.S. attack on Iraq.<p>President Bush might order a military strike against Iraq  to topple the government of President Saddam Hussein, whom  Washington accuses of developing nuclear, biological or  chemical arms.<p>"The rhetoric of fear that is disseminated by my  government, has not, to date, been backed by hard facts that  substantiate any allegations that Iraq is today in possession  of weapons of mass destruction or has links to terror groups  responsible for September 11 attacks on the United States,"  Ritter said.<p><table bgcolor="#FFFFCC" hspace="2" vspace="2" cellspacing="0" width="150" border="0" cellpadding="8" align="LEFT" dwcopytype="CopyTableRow">

</table>The former U.S. Marine resigned his U.N. post in 1998 --  the year inspectors quit Iraq -- and later accused Washington  of using the inspections teams to spy on Iraq.<p>On leaving his U.N. job, Ritter at the time accused the  United Nations and the United States of not being tough enough  on Iraq when it violated Security Council resolutions, but he  subsequently became a vocal critic of U.S. policy on Iraq.<p>"Iraq, during nearly seven years of continuos inspection  activity by the United Nations, had been certified as being  disarmed to a 90-95 percent level," he said.<p>"The truth of the matter is that Iraq today is not a threat  to its neighbors, and is not acting in a manner which threatens  anyone outside of its own borders."<p>UNFETTERED INSPECTIONS<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

</table></font>Ritter, however, said that to avoid U.S. military action  Iraq should provide unfettered return of weapons inspectors,  who left Iraq on the eve of a U.S.-British bombing campaign in  December 1998 for Baghdad's alleged failure to cooperate with  them.<p>"The only path toward peace that will be embraced by the  international community is one which begins by Iraq agreeing to  the immediate, unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspections  operating in full keeping with the mandate as set forth by  existing U.N. Security Council resolutions," he said.<p>Iraq feels that if the inspectors are readmitted, a crisis  over their activities could soon arise which the United States  would exploit as a legitimate pretext for an attack.<p>"Iraq has legitimate grievances regarding the past work of  the weapons inspectors, and for that reason has sought to keep  inspectors from returning to Iraq. But I also know that there  will be no peaceful solution of this current crisis unless Iraq  allows their return," Ritter told parliament.</span>
