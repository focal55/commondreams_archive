<p>Iraqi exiles expected to participate in a future government of their country 
warned yesterday that an invasion by American and British troops would bring widespread 
destruction without removing Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders stressed that a large-scale offensive by Washington and 
its allies would not be supported by opponents of the Baghdad regime, either inside 
or outside Iraq.</p>

</font>In response to repeated reports of the Bush administration preparing for 
war, with a 250,000-strong force, a number of prominent Iraqi defectors insisted 
that more focused, specialist strikes would have far more chance of success.</p> 
<p>In London, where more than 300 opposition military and political leaders are 
taking part in the first conference of its kind, delegates said large-scale Western 
attacks on Iraq were unnecessary because most Iraqi forces would turn against 
President Saddam at the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>A former major-general, Najib al-Salhi, said: "The United States will not find 
support inside or outside Iraq for an offensive that would harm civilians, destroy 
infrastructure, and target troops not defending the regime.</p>
<p>"Any campaign must be limited to toppling Saddam. The army will not defend 
him and neither will the Republican Guard [elite troops thought to be loyal to 
the Iraqi leader]."</p>
<p>In Kuwait, a former Iraqi intelligence chief also warned Washington that a 
land war could leave a desperate Iraqi regime with no option but to use weapons 
of mass destruction. Wafiq al-Samarrai said: "The US should know that Saddam will 
not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction on American military groupings. 
Diplomacy is the only choice for the United States."</p>
<p>Mr Samarrai, who is close to Ahmad Chalabi, the leader of the exiled Iraqi 
National Congress &#150; seen by some in Washington as a possible post-Saddam 
leader &#150; added: "If that fails then another option is an intelligence operation 
that targets the regime only.</p>
<p>"Efforts must focus on core issues to topple the Iraqi regime by choosing the 
best, quickest, and least costly method for the Iraqi people and regional states 
... carrying out a swift intelligence operation."</p>
<p>The opposition leaders are also concerned that the US and Britain may incite 
Iraqis to rise against President Saddam and then fail to help, as happened at 
the end of the Gulf War.</p>
<p>Another former major-general, Tawfiq al-Yassiri, who led an uprising in southern 
Iraq at that time, and was wounded when Iraqi forces crushed the rebels, is among 
senior officers counseling caution to compatriots inside Iraq. They point out 
that it was the US President's father, George Bush Sr, who abandoned the rebels, 
and that some members of his administration were back in power in Washington.</p>
<p>The appearance at the conference of Prince Hassan of Jordan, an uncle of King 
Abdullah, increased speculation over the likelihood of war. Leaked Pentagon reports 
have stated that Jordan has agreed to become one of the bases for a US attack. 
This, however, has been denied by the king.</p>
