<p> WASHINGTON, July 25 &#0151; Brushing off Congressional complaints about creating 
a "snitch system," Attorney General John Ashcroft said today the administration 
would go ahead to form a corps of truck and bus drivers, port workers, meter readers, 
letter carriers and others to report suspicious activities around the nation.</p>
<P> In the House, the attack on the program, known as TIPS (for Terrorism Information 
and Prevention System), has been led by conservative Republicans, including the 
majority leader Dick Armey and Representative Bob Barr of Georgia. </p>
<P> After a firestorm of criticism last week, mainly from conservatives, the House 
is prepared to prohibit the planned program in the Homeland Security Department 
legislation. Mr. Armey said the ban was needed so the government would not "promote 
citizens spying on one another."</p>
<P> But in the Senate, where Mr. Ashcroft appeared today, conservatives are not 
as concerned about privacy as their House counterparts are. So the attacks come 
from liberals like Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts and Charles E. Schumer of New York.</p>
<P> Mr. Ashcroft was defended by Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama. 
"We get complaints from left and right," Mr. Sessions said, noting both sets of 
objectors. "We have some paranoid people on the right also."</p>
<P> At a contentious hearing of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ashcroft said industries 
like trucking sought the TIPS program, which could make good use of people who 
would notice "anomalies," like a truck parked in a neighborhood doing surveillance 
work. He insisted that the corps would not invade homes.</p>
<P> Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, seemed unsatisfied, saying 
"the program would enlist thousands, even millions, of civilians as TIPS informants 
to report their suspicions to the Justice Department." </p>
<P> "We could be vigilant," he said, "but we don't want to be vigilantes."</p>
<P> Mr. Ashcroft sought to calm one area of concern by insisting that the TIPS 
program would not maintain a computer database of reports, but would simply forward 
tips it received to other agencies.</p>
<P> Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee's senior Republican, said that 
commitment was "reassuring" because, "We don't want to see a `1984' Orwellian-type 
situation here where neighbors are reporting on neighbors."</p>
<P> President Bush mentioned the TIPS program in his State of the Union speech, 
and again in Knoxville on April 8 when he said, "This is a program where truckers 
can report anything that might be suspicious." He added, "If people see anything 
suspicious, utility workers, you ought to report it. This is a way to organize 
that which already happens in our communities on a daily basis and a way to make 
the homeland more secure and more prepared."</p>
<P> The program, which the Justice Department intends to begin on a pilot basis 
in 10 cities next month, languished in relative obscurity until this month, when 
the American Civil Liberties Union said, "The administration apparently wants 
to implement a program that will turn local cable or gas or electrical technicians 
into government-sanctioned peeping Toms." Mr. Ashcroft said today that the administration 
"never proposed cable installers," adding, "That's part of just the apocrypha."</p>
<P> Mr. Barr called TIPS a "snitch system," saying, "A formal program, organized, 
paid for and maintained by our own federal government to recruit Americans to 
spy on fellow Americans, smacks of the very type of fascist or Communist government 
we fought so hard to eradicate in other countries in decades past." </p>
<P> Mr. Leahy offered a homegrown example of excess today. "In 1917, the Justice 
Department formed the American Protective League, who had volunteers to report 
on people who might criticize their government," he said. "Sometimes they would 
turn into vigilante groups that raided newspaper offices, actually tarred and 
feathered some people."</p>
<P> Laura W. Murphy, director of the A.C.L.U.'s national office here, said after 
the hearing that Mr. Ashcroft did not ease her group's fears. "Notwithstanding 
all of these assurances, this is still government-sanctioned peeping Toms," she 
said. "This is a program where people's activities, statements, posters in their 
windows or on their walls, nationality, and religious practices will be reported 
by untrained individuals without any relationship to criminal activity."</p>
