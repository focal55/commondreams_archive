<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
a move that is attracting national attention, gubernatorial candidate Robert Reich 
has announced that he supports the right of gays and lesbians to marry. 
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The announcement, first reported earlier this week in Bay Windows and InNewsweekly, 
two Boston gay newspapers, sets the former US labor secretary apart from his major-party 
opponents. The four other Democratic candidates support Vermont-style civil unions, 
which provide most of the legal benefits of marriage but are not recognized by 
other states. Republican Mitt Romney opposes civil unions, but supports domestic 
partnership laws that would give gay couples access to health benefits and survivorship 
rights. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian candidate Carla Howell also 
support marriage for gays. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ''I became convinced that it was really a matter of leadership, and that it 
was a civil rights issue, and that it was important to make a stand,'' Reich said 
yesterday in an interview with the Globe. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reich said gay marriage would be more far-reaching than the civil unions that 
are now law in Vermont. Gay couples married under Massachusetts law could sue 
more strongly for recognition in states that do not recognize civil unions, he 
said. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The announcement is gaining attention among gay and lesbian political activists 
around the country. Gay rights groups estimate that gays make up 5 percent of 
the electorate, but are an increasingly visible constituency and source of campaign 
contributions. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Reich move also underscores the perceived clout of gay voters in the Massachusetts 
Democratic primary. Earlier this week, Senate President Thomas Birmingham, also 
a gubernatorial candidate, pleased gay rights leaders when he blocked a vote on 
a ballot initiative that would bar gay marriage, preventing its advancement. Birmingham 
adamantly opposes the ballot question. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But support of gay marriage is a rare position. Gay rights advocates yesterday 
could not name a prominent national politician who shares Reich's position. And 
while only Vermont recognizes civil unions, and Hawaii and California offer more 
limited benefit rights for gay couples, at least 36 states have passed bills outlawing 
gay marriage. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ''He deserves enormous credit for taking such a principled position,'' said 
David Smith, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign. 
''This is a refreshing change.'' </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reich does not have a blueprint for working a marriage bill through Massachusetts, 
where the Legislature has been reluctant to support more modest gay rights measures, 
such as domestic partnership health benefits for gay partners of state employees. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But Reich says that he is confident that, by educating the public, he will 
be able to convince state residents to support gay marriage, and to see it, as 
he does, as a civil rights issue. The Legislature will respond to a groundswell 
of support, he said. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ''It's a matter of leadership,'' he said. ''Many people have not focused on 
the issue. They don't fully understand it.'' </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reich's decision to support gay marriages surprised even some members of his 
staff. Until now, he has said he supported civil unions, but feared that gay marriage 
would cause a backlash that could jeopardize gay rights. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But Reich said he changed his mind shortly before he spoke at the Boston Pride 
gay and lesbian festival earlier this month, after talking to supporters - particularly 
his campaign volunteer Corey Johnson, a young gay man from the North Shore who 
made national news when he came out to his high school football team. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Gay rights advocates say the topic is still provoking tough battles. In Vermont, 
civil unions came about only after a lengthy and confrontational process. It began 
with a 1999 ruling from the state Supreme Court, ordering the Legislature to create 
a remedy that gave gay and lesbian relationships legal status. After fiery debate, 
legislators produced the civil union law in 2000. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The state elections that followed were widely seen as a backlash: the state 
House of Representatives changed hands and became Republican-controlled, while 
Democrats barely retained control of the state Senate. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In Massachusetts, debates on gay rights have long been contentious. James 
Lafferty, spokesman for Massachusetts Citizens for Marriage, the group that proposed 
the ballot initiative, said he believes voters here remain opposed to gay marriage. 
''It's cultural. It's very religious,'' he said. ''It's not like some sort of 
tax policy where you can change a few numbers and everyone smiles and goes along. 
It's very passionate.'' </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> His group seeks to put the gay marriage ban before voters in 2004, and won 
a legal victory this month when the state's highest court said the question could 
go forward. It requires the support of 25 percent of legislators in two subsequent 
sessions to reach the ballot. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And while some local gay rights advocates said they sense that views on the 
issue are evolving within the public and the State House, they were cautious about 
the chances for gay marriage anytime soon, especially with a social conservative, 
Thomas Finneran, presiding as speaker of the House. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ''People are really grappling with it,'' said Gary Buseck, executive director 
of Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders in Boston. ''To get it through the 
Legislature is maybe a long shot.'' </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reich said the issue would be one of his top priorities, but offered no timetable 
for its achievement. The former labor secretary had a front-row seat for a similar 
battle in 1993, when President Clinton fought to allow openly gay soldiers in 
the military. Clinton eventually implemented a controversial ''don't ask, don't 
tell'' policy, and observers said he lost political capital. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reich said he could avoid the same problems by sticking to a clear, if ambitious, 
goal rather than seeking a compromise like civil unions. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ''Sometimes, more confusion is sowed by politicians who don't take clear stands 
- or want to, in a way, satisfy everyone without educating anyone about an issue,'' 
he said. </font></font>
