<p>An influential US senator has added his voice to growing opposition to a military 
strike against Iraq. 
<P> Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
said the US military was much more cautious about going to war with Iraq than 
civilian officials. 
<P> He said "containment of Saddam is working". 
<P> "It's almost certain that if we did attack Saddam that he then would use the 
weapons of mass destruction because he'd have nothing to lose in response to that 
kind of an attack," the Michigan senator said. 
<P> Meanwhile, a British MP from Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party, who 
met Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week, has said Baghdad is willing to allow 
UN arms inspectors back in. 
<P> The UK and United States have demanded unfettered access for the UN inspectors, 
amid fears that Iraq is developing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. 
<P> US President George Bush has repeatedly said he wants "regime change" in Iraq, 
and is looking at a range of options to ensure Iraq cannot use weapons of mass 
destruction. 
<P> Over the weekend, he stressed that he was still consulting with Congress and 
America's allies and that no decision had been made. 
<P><B>'He's a survivalist'</B> 
<P> Mr Levin, who is familiar with the thinking of America's top generals, said 
it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein would strike first. 
<P> "He would not, in my judgment, initiate an attack with a weapon of mass destruction, 
because it would lead to his own destruction. ... He's a survivalist. He is not 
a suicide bomber," he told NBC television's Meet the Press. 
<P> He is not the first senior lawmaker to speak out against attacking Iraq. 
<P> Last week, Republican Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of Representatives, 
caused a stir when he broke ranks and said the Iraqi leader should be left to 
rant and rave on his own, warning against taking action without "proper provocation". 
<P> Iraq has made a number of gestures towards compromise in recent days, saying 
it is willing to discuss allowing UN weapons inspectors back into the country. 
<P><B>MP meets Saddam</B> 
<P> The latest overture from Baghdad came via a British MP, Labour member George 
Galloway, who met Saddam Hussein last week and says he offered to allow UN arms 
inspections to resume. 
<P> Mr Galloway, a long-time opponent of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq, 
met the Iraqi President in a heavily protected bunker in Baghdad last Thursday. 
<P> The MP said Saddam Hussein told him he was willing to comply with the outstanding 
UN Security Council resolutions in Iraq, which would allow arms inspectors unfettered 
access, although Mr Galloway conceded the Iraqi President did not use the word 
"unfettered". 
<P><B>'This changes nothing'</B> 
<P> The UK Foreign Office dismissed the offer. 
<P> "This changes nothing. Saddam Hussein knows clearly what he has to do and 
that is comply with UN Security Council resolutions. The ball is in his court," 
a spokesman said. 
<P> Mr Galloway said he was surprised on his visit to see Saddam Hussein offer 
him British chocolates, and praise Britain as a major influence on Iraq. 
<P> "Even at the height of our strategic relationship with the Soviet Union, Britain 
was the Iraqis' first choice. Whether for holidays - one million big spending 
Iraqis a year used to travel to London - or 'Made in Britain' goods," the MP quoted 
Saddam Hussein as saying. 
<P> "Our measurements, our scientific standards, our punctual red double-decker 
buses, even our electric plugs were all based on the British. We don't know why 
you turned against us more than any other European country." 
<P> He also praised British wartime leader Winston Churchill, and echoed his famous 
rhetoric in saying that Iraq would fight back against any invasion. 
<P> "We will fight them on the streets, from the rooftops, from house to house. 
We will never surrender," Saddam Hussein said. 
<P> Meanwhile, an opinion poll released on Monday showed that almost two-thirds 
of Britons believe an attack on Iraq would be unjustified. 
<P> According to the survey, conducted for the Daily Telegraph newspaper by YouGov, 
an internet-based pollster, 90% of Britons fear that Islamic fundamentalist terrorists 
would respond with attack on the West. </p>
