<p>Military conflict escalated along the borders of India and Pakistan, as militants attacked more police posts in Kashmir amid US warnings that "irresponsible elements" in the two countries could spark a war.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, meanwhile, called an unscheduled meeting with his three key advisers on security matters -- Defense Minister George Fernandes, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh and Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani.</p>
<p>Singh afterwards said "various issues" had been discussed, without elaborating, although the chiefs of the Indian army, navy and air force did not attend.</p>
<p>Fernandes Thursday canceled plans to attend an international conference in Singapore this weekend, his office having earlier said his attendance would be dependent on the prevailing security situation.</p>
<p>A defense spokesman in Jammu, southern Kashmir, said heavy cross-border shelling, mortar and gunfire had raged across the India-Pakistan borders overnight and early Thursday, with the district of Poonch becoming one of the main flashpoints.</p>
<p>At least seven people were killed in the fierce artillery duel that continued deep into the night, Indian police said.</p>
<p>Political analyst Balraj Puri described the current flare up as "serious" as tempers were running high on both sides.</p>
<p>Three separate attacks in Kashmir overnight on police and paramilitary posts, allegedly by Islamic militants, in which four police, two soldiers and a civilian were killed, heightened tension palpably in the disputed state.</p>
<p>In the most dramatic of the attacks, a group of militants stormed into a police station at Doda district, 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of Kashmir's winter capital Jammu, late Wednesday killing the two policemen on duty.</p>
<p>Police around midday (0630 GMT) Thursday said the attackers were still holed up in the building and a gun battle was raging.</p>
<p>Reinforcements had been summoned as other militants hiding in nearby forests and mountains were opening intermittent fire on the police post.</p>
<p>In two other separate incidents, a woman constable and a policeman were killed by suspected militants at a small police post in southern Rajouri district, while two paramilitaries were killed in Udhampur in the north, police said.</p>
<p>The United States, meanwhile, warned India and Pakistan late Wednesday that "irresponsible elements" in the two countries could spark a war, if the two nuclear rivals allow their relations to further deteriorate.</p>
<p>"The climate is very charged and a serious conflagration could ensue if events spiral out of control," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in the most explicit US language over the prospect of a new war between the two uneasy neighbors in some days.</p>
<p>"There is a danger that as tensions escalate, the leaders could find themselves in a situation in which irresponsible elements can spark a conflict," he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan's new ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram, meanwhile, defended his country's refusal to rule out an aggressive nuclear strike, saying it had to deter India's superior conventional army.</p>
<p>Speaking Wednesday, only one day after he presented his letters of credentials to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Akram told a news conference India was "arming itself to the teeth" and Pakistan could not hope to match it.</p>
<p>"We have to rely our on means to deter Indian aggression. We have that means and we will not neutralize it by any doctrine of no first-use."</p>
<p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have risen nearly to flashpoint since a massacre in southern Kashmir on May 14 that India blames on Islamic militants sponsored by Islamabad.</p>
