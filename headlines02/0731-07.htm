<p> WASHINGTON -- The war will involve 250,000 troops, or it could be just 70,000. 
They might attack Iraq from three sides, or they could largely finish the job 
with an assault on Baghdad.
<p>Since President Bush announced months ago a determined but still-unformed plan 
to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, such diverse and contradictory reports 
have been filling an information vacuum and shaping public discussion.
<p>Foreign policy experts say it is unprecedented for the U.S. government to air 
such vague and open-ended plans for war, and they predict that the leaks will 
remain central to the public discussion until the administration decides how to 
deal with Hussein and begins to talk more openly about it.
<p> Now Congress, which has been largely on the sidelines, is looking for answers 
too.
<p>Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opens hearings to raise such 
questions as the rationale and risks of a war, and how long the United States 
would need to remain as a steward for Iraq afterward. Committee Chairman Sen. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), who has been pushing the administration to better 
"define its objectives" in Iraq, said Tuesday that he knew of no place "where 
there has been ... a thorough discussion of all these issues."
<p>Another influential senator cautioned that it was precisely this kind of national 
debate that was missing as the United States began to deepen its involvement in 
Vietnam decades ago.
<p>Questions about the administration's plans for Iraq have been increasingly 
urgent since Bush began signaling his determination to force a "regime change" 
in Iraq in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
<p>Although he has insisted that he has approved no war plan, he has laid the 
groundwork for military action in several speeches. He has said the United States 
would be justified in "preempting" dangerous regimes that threaten it with chemical, 
biological and nuclear weapons. Bush has also approved covert action against Hussein.
<p>Polls have repeatedly indicated that Congress and the public support a new 
war on Iraq, at least as a general proposition. And in Washington political circles, 
many people are convinced that Bush is fully committed to a war, next year if 
not sooner.
<p>Yet as the months have passed, the administration has remained internally divided. 
Some officials want to move faster than others, or use more ground forces, or 
rely more heavily on Iraqi opposition groups.
<p>Administration officials have denounced insiders who are secretly releasing 
information to influence policy, and have called on the FBI to try to track them 
down.
<p>"It's become a leak-driven debate," said Derek Chollet, a State Department 
official in the Clinton administration. "Every one that comes out kicks up new 
dust."
<p>As the debate has continued, officials have insisted that there is nothing 
more they can say about their plans, because none have been made final.
<p>"We don't know if the United States &#91;will&#93; exercise a military option 
with respect to Iraq," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters Tuesday. 
He insisted that the administration has several possible approaches to removing 
Hussein, including "diplomatic, economic and military" means.
<p>At the same time, Rumsfeld seemed to reiterate the administration's desire 
for more aggressive action by insisting that Iraq is unlikely to agree to the 
kind of United Nations inspections that would uncover weapons of mass destruction.
<p>U.S. allies are calling on the U.N. to exhaust efforts at weapons inspections 
before any military action would be undertaken. Rumsfeld was suggesting that would 
be a waste of time.
<p>"It's difficult to comprehend--even to begin to think--that they would accept 
such &#91;an inspection&#93; regime," he said.
<p>Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said recently that 
he believed the leaked war-planning documents that have appeared in news reports 
have come from middle- or upper-middle-level officials, some of whom were in remote 
government planning offices. But he said none of the proposals had gotten so far 
as to receive a vote from top-level officials.
<p>In addition to the varying numbers of U.S. troops and attack strategies championed 
by different camps in the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence communities, 
the leaks have reflected policy disagreements within the administration on even 
whether attacking Hussein is preferable to trying to contain him.
<p>Lawmakers and experts have increasingly urged that these issues be discussed 
in public.
<p>Lee Hamilton, former chairman of the House International Relations Committee, 
said that "given the magnitude and the importance of the task of trying to change 
the Iraqi leadership, there's been remarkably little debate on it."
<p>That sentiment is increasingly shared by lawmakers of both parties, some of 
whom have been actively urging the administration to be more forthcoming on its 
intentions.
<p>Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) has urged a national debate on the issue, noting 
that there was no such debate about Vietnam in the early 1960s.
<p>Experts say there are risks for the administration if Americans don't fully 
understand what would be involved in a military campaign, especially one that 
risked widespread use of chemical or biological weapons against U.S. troops.
<p>If Americans discover that a war against Iraq is bloodier or more expensive 
than they expected, or requires a longer U.S. presence in Iraq, there could be 
a public backlash, the experts say.
<p>Experts note, too, that the months of leaks will only make it harder for the 
administration to decide what to do, and then to sell the policy it has chosen 
to Americans and allied countries.
<p>"Foreign policy by leak is never a good idea: You can't control the message, 
and your policy looks like it's in disarray," said Chollet, the former State Department 
official.
<p>He predicted that it will be increasingly difficult for the administration 
to remain silent on its intentions as lawmakers and others in Washington debate 
the issues.
<p>"I think the administration is going to be forced to say more," he said. "Otherwise 
they're going to be letting others shape the debate." </p>
