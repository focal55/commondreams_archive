<p>Saddam Hussein said Iraq was ready to face up to any US military campaign, as US President George W. Bush stepped up pressure for a tough new UN resolution on disarmament.</p>
<p>"We are preparing ourselves as if war were to take place in one hour. We are psychologically ready," Saddam told Egyptian weekly Elosboa in a rare interview Sunday. published on its www.elosboa.com website.</p>
<p>"We are thus prepared for for war," Saddam said in the interview which was also published on its www.elosboa.com website.</p>
<p>And the Iraqi leader warned the United States that "Iraq will never be like Afghanistan.</p>
<p>"That is not to say that we are stronger than the United States, which has fleets and long-range missiles. But we have our faith in God, the homeland and the Iraqi people as well as the Arab people."</p>
<p>A war "will never be a cakewalk for US and British soldiers," the Iraqi strongman warned in the interview.</p>
<p>"The Arab people are not, as some think, in a deep sleep. The protests in the Arab world and the West, gathering hundreds of thousands of pacifists opposed to a war on the Iraqi people, challenge the wish of the Zionist right and extremists in Washington to destroy Iraq."</p>
<p>Saddam accused the United States of wanting to "extend its hegemony over the Arab world by starting with control of Baghdad and then striking capitals that reject this hegemony."</p>
<p>At a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, Bush stepped up pressure for a new British-supported UN resolution that would set tough new conditions for starting UN weapons inspections in Iraq.</p>
<p>France, Russia and China, the remaining permanent council members that have veto power, oppose the text because of "hidden triggers" for the automatic use of military force against Iraq.</p>
<p>"The message to this august body is to be effective," Bush said, remaining tight-lipped on a deadline for any resolution.</p>
<p>"Be the United Nations, not the League of Nations," he said referring to the failure of the previous world body to bring about peace in the aftermath of World War I.</p>
<p>Earlier, Paris "categorically" denied a report by the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that a French envoy had been shuttling to Baghdad for months in a bid to remove any pretext for US-led military action to oust Saddam.</p>
<p>Arab League chief Amr Mussa later called for a "just and reasonable" UN resolution which "must be aimed first and foremost at helping the inspectors (disarm Iraq) and not create obstacles".</p>
<p>"If this happens, then everyone will cooperate with such a decision which is 
aimed at restoring credibility to the UN Security Council," the secretary general 
of the 22-member pan-Arab organization said in Amman.</p>
<p>Mussa said he was opposed to the imposition of a regime change in Iraq, stressing that such an issue "is strictly an Iraqi decision which we don't intervene in."</p>
<p>Mussa also confirmed that the foreign ministers of the Arab League will hold 
an emergency meeting at the organization's headquarters in Cairo on November 10 
to discuss the US threats against Iraq and the Palestinian crisis.</p>
<p>In London, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Saddam had instructed agents to kill Iraqi opposition leaders based in Britain to prevent them from forming an alternative government if he is overthrown.</p>
<p>British and US intelligence officials have received information in the past 
week that Saddam has issued a presidential decree authorizing the murder of leading 
members of the Iraqi opposition "by any means necessary."</p>
<p>He is also said to have approached Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi -- who is known 
to have a network of "sleeper" agents in Britain and Europe -- to help him target 
Iraqi dissidents.</p>
