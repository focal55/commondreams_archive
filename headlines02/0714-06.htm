<p>The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens 
as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/tips.html" target="_new">Terrorism 
Information and Prevention System</a>, or TIPS, means the US will have a higher 
percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous 
Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans 
to report "suspicious activity".</p>
<p>Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier this 
year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale investigations 
of US citizens.</p>
<p>As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war 
against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.</p>
<p>Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are being 
recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to homes, businesses 
or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees, truck drivers and train 
conductors are among those named as targeted recruits. 
<p>A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov, 
is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants participating 
in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the 10 largest US cities, 
that will be 1 million informants for a total population of almost 24 million, 
or one in 24 people.</p>
<p>Historically, informant systems have been the tools of non-democratic states. 
According to a 1992 report by Harvard University's Project on Justice, the accuracy 
of informant reports is problematic, with some informants having embellished the 
truth, and others suspected of having fabricated their reports.</p>
<p>Present Justice Department procedures mean that informant reports will enter 
databases for future reference and/or action. The information will then be broadly 
available within the department, related agencies and local police forces. The 
targeted individual will remain unaware of the existence of the report and of 
its contents.</p>
<p>The Patriot Act already provides for a person's home to be searched without 
that person being informed that a search was ever performed, or of any surveillance 
devices that were implanted.</p>
<p>At state and local levels the TIPS program will be co-ordinated by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, which was given sweeping new powers, including internment, 
as part of the Reagan Administration's national security initiatives. Many key 
figures of the Reagan era are part of the Bush Administration.</p>
<p>The creation of a US "shadow government", operating in secret, was another 
Reagan national security initiative. </p>
<p><I>Ritt Goldstein is an investigative journalist and a former leader in the 
movement for US law enforcement accountability. He has lived in Sweden since 1997, 
seeking political asylum there, saying he was the victim of life-threatening assaults 
in retaliation for his accountability efforts. His application has been supported 
by the European Parliament, five of Sweden's seven big political parties, clergy, 
and Amnesty and other rights groups.</I></p>
