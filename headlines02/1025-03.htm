<p>It is certainly not a retreat, not even a reversal of long-term strategy, but 
the United States has been quietly redeploying its forces in the Gulf, hinting 
that an attack on Iraq may be delayed.</p>
<p>After a steady build-up of troops in the area, much of it undisclosed, to 60,000 
in the past seven weeks, America's momentum appears to be slowing as the diplomatic 
war over a new United Nations resolution reaches its final, crucial phase.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the US 5th Fleet continues to host a battle group in Bahrain 
led by an aircraft carrier. But, diplomatic sources said, there are no plans, 
as had been expected, for the USS Abraham Lincoln to be joined by another carrier. 
The USS George Washington, which was in the Gulf before Lincoln, is believed to 
be on its way home.</p>
<p>The Amphibious Ready group of the US Marines, has also left the area recently. 
The force, which will play a key role in any assault on Iraq, is undertaking an 
exercise in Djibouti, in the horn of Africa.</p>
<p>At the same time, the upsurge of recent activity by al-Qa'ida and their sympathizers 
has led to an upgrading of security for American and British service personnel 
arms and equipment. There are fears about possible suicide attacks on shipping 
in the Gulf.</p>
<p>At present the US base in Manama is home to about 2,000 personnel, a figure 
that is expected to rise to almost 4,000 if and when the decision is made to initiate 
the final stages of military planning. Its numbers have recently been stable.</p>
<p>The American naval force includes attack submarines, cruisers, destroyers and 
up to 70 fighters. The USAF has bombers, tactical fighters and refueling tankers 
at Sheikh Isa air base. The British contribution consists of a small number of 
Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft and VC10 tankers &#150; again, without recent increases 
to these numbers.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials have said the continuing haggling at the UN over the wording 
of the resolution could delay the deployment of American troops for a possible 
attack against Saddam Hussein's regime. If a resolution is adopted and weapons 
inspectors return to Iraq for operations expected to take months, then the time 
frame is almost certain to slip beyond this winter.</p>
<p>Both US and British commanders are believed to oppose the deployment of further 
large contingents of personnel to the Gulf if plans for an attack are put on hold. 
Keeping servicemen and women in the same bases or aircraft carriers for months 
on end is thought to sap morale, which is why the marines have been sent to Djibouti.</p>
<p>But the Pentagon has now secured all the roll-on roll-off vessels necessary 
for directly shipping heavy armour into the area, and this is likely to continue, 
diplomatic sources said. About 600 members of CentCom, the US Central Command 
at Tampa, Florida, who are due in Qatar next month, are still expected to arrive, 
purportedly for an exercise.</p>
<p>There is little sign of political support for a new war from the governments 
in the region that supported the United States in the 1990-91 Gulf War. Bahrain, 
which is holding its first democratic elections in 29 years, fears the economic 
and political consequences of an assault on Iraq could be extremely unpleasant
