            LAS VEGAS (CBS.MW) -- Although Enron's large contributions to key 
            legislators and members of the Bush administration apparently were 
            not enough to pull its financial fat out of the fire, one group of 
            major energy-business political donors just hit the jackpot. 
            <p>While it will be at least a decade -- if then -- before radioactive 
              waste begins pouring into Nevada's Yucca Mountain, the Department 
              of Energy's decision to recommend the site is a big victory for 
              the nuclear power industry. </p>
            
<p>Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said Thursday he plans to formally 
              recommend the Silver State site as a new federal repository for 
              nuclear waste -- delighting plant operators and infuriating Nevada 
              businesses, politicians and environmentalists. 
<p>Transporting all of its radioactive byproducts to one central location 
              and storing it there -- both at taxpayer expense -- has long been 
              at the top of the nuclear industry's wish list. Currently, most 
              nuclear waste generated from commercial plants is stored on-site, 
              a cost shouldered by the operators. 
            
<p>The <a href="http://www.nei.org/" target="_new">Nuclear Energy Institute</a> wasted no time in hailing Abraham's 
              decision: "Safely transporting nuclear waste from 35 states to one 
              secure, specifically designed federal disposal facility underground 
              is the best solution to protect our environment and our national 
              security," said Joe Colvin, president of the trade group. 
            
<p><b>Companies backed Senate bid </b>
            
<p>Abraham received thousands of dollars in contributions from the 
              industry in his campaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate from 
              Michigan in 2000. In addition to NEI's $4,000, private nuclear-plant 
              operators DTE Energy, with $5,000, Exelon, at $2,000, Constellation, $2,000, and FirstEnergy, 
              also $2,000, ponied up for his failed bid. 
            
<p>Abraham also accepted at least $9,500 from energy-trading company 
              Enron  between February of 1999 and October 
              2000. 
            <p>Although Attorney General John Ashcroft recently recused himself 
              from involvement in the criminal probe of Enron because he had accepted 
              over $50,000 of the company's money in the past, Joe Davis, a spokesman 
              for the Department of Energy, insisted that Abraham has no such 
              conflict. 
            <p>Abraham based his decision solely on "sound science and compelling 
              interests [of] national security and environmental protection," 
              he said. 
            
<p>While the nuclear industry has given to both major parties, the 
              GOP has long received the lion's share of the booty. For instance, 
              the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/" target="_new">Center for Responsive Politics</a> said that in the last election 
              cycle Republican candidates got more than two-thirds of the $335,000 
              given by NEI and nearly three quarters of $819,000 contributed by 
              leading nuclear operator Exelon. 
            <p>The next call in the ongoing battle will be made by the White House, 
              which is on record as being in favor of both expanded nuclear power 
              and the establishment of a central repository for nuclear waste. 
            <p>If, as expected, the Bush administration approves the site, Nevada's 
              governor or state legislature gets a chance to veto the decision, 
              which will stop the project until and unless Congress overrides 
              it. 
            <p>Furious members of the state's congressional delegation, including 
              Senate Majority Whip Harry Reid, have vowed to do whatever it takes 
              to keep the Yucca from opening. And, even should they fail, Nevada 
              Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, has vowed a court battle.
