NEW DELHI, Jan 25 (IPS) - Governments concerned about nuclear
proliferation
should be more worried by the greater potential for mischief that
biotechnology holds in military and criminal minds, say members of
an
international panel of scientists involved in shaping the
Biosafety Protocol. 
<P>
   In India for a strategy session ahead of the <a href="http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/eng/index.asp" target="_new">Second World
Social Forum</a>
in Porte Alegre, Brazil next week, which will discuss alternatives
to
globalization, the experts said biotechnology weapon programs
now being
developed secretly by several governments are insidious.  
<P>
   They are more difficult to detect than programs for
developing nuclear
weapons, they added. 
<P>
   ''Biotechnology weapons come out of test tubes rather than the
large
conspicuous facilities that are needed for developing and
delivering
nuclear weapons,'' Christine von Wiezsacker, vice president of
Ecoropa, the
Green Movement of Europe told IPS. <P>
   And in the same way that nuclear technology was promoted as
having the
potential to solve supposed shortages of energy resources,
biotechnology is
now being touted by its proponents as the answer to mythical food
shortages, added Sue Edwards, biology professor at the Addis Ababa
University, Ethiopia. 
<P>
   Wiezsacker said there were too many ''gray areas'' in
biotechnology that
are being  exploited in the name of food security but are actually
detrimental to it. 
<P>
   A classic example is ''terminator'' technology, which renders
seeds
infertile in subsequent generations so that farmers are forced to
return to
the transnational firms to buy seeds rather than use what they
have stored,
as in traditional farming  <P>
   ''Terminator technology delivered from the outside could make
entire
countries dependent on TNCs for their seed requirements,''
Wieszacker said. <P>
   ''This is in fact a war on entire species at the cost of
monocultures
which are vulnerable to ecological breakdown and are
unsustainable,''
Edwards said. <P>
    Worst of all is the refusal of governments that are backed by
the same
TNCs to accept the international regulation of little-understood
areas of
biotechnology, notably genetic engineering, despite its potential
for mass
destruction, intended or otherwise, said Prof. Jean Grossholtz,
feminist
and global campaigner for cultural and biological diversity. 
<P>
   Grossholtz , who teaches at the Holyoke College in
Massachusetts in the
United States, said the U.S. government was taking advantage of
the Sep. 11
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and the anthrax
scare, to
restrict the right of citizens to information about its biological
defense
program.
<P>
   She said the US government is clearly more interested in
defending the
interests of TNCs than in protecting citizens from biological
warfare, and
is now also moving away from commitments under the Biological and
Toxin
Weapons Convention (BTWC) not to develop or stockpile biological
weapons. 
<P>
   In fact, the United States has been accused of sabotaging the
fifth
convention of the BTWC at Geneva in December, where negotiations
were held
on for mandatory verification mechanisms for the international
inspection
of suspected biological weapons research and production
facilities.  
<P>
   Wiezsacker, Edwards and Grossholtz are part of Diverse Women
for
Diversity, a movement begun with the avowed aim of creating
diverse
solutions to economic globalization at the local level and
building a
coalition of women for a common defense against the process at a
global level. 
<P>
   They are being hosted in India by Vandana Shiva, a founder of
the
movement and director of the New Delhi-based, Research Foundation
for
Science, Technology and Ecology, which works on protecting
sustainable,
organic farming. 
<P>
   A self-declared nuclear-weapons state, India has been
vigorously
pursuing genetic engineering as a means to food security. This is
in spite
of a massive 50-million ton grain surplus amidst widespread
reports of
starvation deaths and chronic malnutrition among more than half of
its
billion plus population. 
<P>
   But thanks to a powerful political and bureaucratic elite that
dictates
policy in India, the country has a chain of state-run laboratories
and
facilities that have acknowledged capabilities in frontline areas
like
space, nuclear and missile technology as well as biotechnology. <P>
   In the midst of the global anthrax scare last year, the Indian
government's biotechnology laboratories showed off their prowess
by
announcing the development of a superior recombinant vaccine
against the
farmyard germ that has earned notoriety as a biological warfare
agent. 
<P>
   The experts said that India -- which is now firmly committed to
globalization after renouncing half-a-century of independent
development --
presented the classic example of how food shortages were caused by
poor
distribution mechanisms and government policies rather than low
agricultural output. 
<P>
   This month, India officially permitted the sale of genetically
engineered cotton seeds, although Shiva and other activists have
campaigned
against it for years. They have a petition pending in the Supreme
Court
seeking to restrain the government from letting in the technology
without
public debate. <P>
   But genetically engineered cotton has been freely available in
the
Indian seed market for at least three years now.  <P>
   Shiva and other activists believe that this is the result of
clandestine
testing carried out by the translation firm that developed the
seed by
splicing it with toxic genes from bacteria for pest resistance. <P>
   Shiva said no attempt was ever made to hold the U.S.-based
Monsanto
Corporation, which owns the patent for genetically engineered  
cotton, 
accountable at any time for tests that became controversial after 
volunteers took to physically uprooting the cotton plants in  
southern 
Karnataka state. <P>
   ''It is the responsibility of the government to hold those who  
own the 
patents on and distribute genetically modified crops liable for  
any 
ecological, social and economic consequences,'' Shiva said. <P>
   Another member of the movement, Ursula Oswald Spring, a former  
minister 
for environment from Mexico, noted that no attention was being  
paid to the 
fact that cotton seed was fed to cattle in India and that the  
toxic genes 
could easily spread through cross-pollination because most of  
India's 
farmers are small-holders. <P>
   Spring, who now teaches at the National University of Mexico,  
said she 
saw many similarities between the situation in her country and  
that in 
India especially in terms of the heated debates over the subject. <P>
   ''Mexico does not allow the planting of genetically engineered  
crops, 
but is forced to import them thanks to trade agreements. This  
poses the 
hazard of contamination 
 across species,''  she said adding that India now faces similar  
dangers. 
<P>
   Wiezsacker said that whatever the argument in favor of genetic 
engineering, the fact remains that insurance countries have  
refused to 
insure against mishaps arising from the release of genetically  
engineered 
organisms into the environment simply because of insufficient  
science.  
<P>
   ''Right now, even the question of who would be liable in the  
event of a 
catastrophe remains to be answered,'' she pointed out. </p>
