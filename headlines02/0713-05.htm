<p> SAN SALVADOR ATENCO, Mexico - Hundreds of machete-wielding farmers protesting 
the government's plan to take their land for a new airport outside Mexico City 
were on alert for a showdown with police Friday night, a day after taking seven 
hostages during clashes that left 30 injured.</p>
<p>With more than 300 riot police stationed in trucks outside  the town, a tense calm reigned in San Salvador Atenco, which  lies beyond Mexico City's garbage dump about 18 miles outside  of the capital.</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

July 12, 2002, in state of Mexico. Farmers desperate to keep the government from 
seizing their land for a new Mexico City airport threatened Friday to spark uprisings 
across the country unless police free fellow protesters arrested during an earlier 
confrontation with police. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) <br>

</table></font>Masked men wielding machetes, Molotov cocktails, sticks and  stones patrolled the streets, ready to fight if the police  stormed an auditorium where the hostages were being held.</p><p>Mexico State authorities said they had freed three out of  15 farmers arrested in the clashes.</p><p>In a news conference late Friday night, the farmers  demanded the government annul a decree expropriating their land  as a key condition for releasing the hostages and said they  would only negotiate with federal, rather than state,  authorities.</p><p>Some farmers had earlier threatened to kill the hostages,  who include local government officials, unless police free two  of their leaders and 13 others arrested in violence on  Thursday.</p><p>But protest leader David Pajaro said the hostages would not  be harmed.</p><p>"It's up to the government to solve this situation," he  said. He said his group was in negotiations with the government  but refused to give details.</p><p>The crowd was preparing to march on the capital Friday  afternoon, but the biggest activity in town was the unloading  of two Coca-Cola trucks the farmers hijacked. The crowd guzzled  soft drinks and saved the bottles to make Molotov cocktails.</p><p>The hostages, with their hands tied behind their backs,  were allowed to talk to reporters and said they were unharmed.</p><p>PATIENCE RUNNING OUT</p><p>But state officials warned their patience was running out.</p><p>"Tolerance and prudence have their limits. They have  committed crimes, they have kidnapped people," said Manuel  Cadena, interior minister in Mexico State, which circles the  capital city and is home to the international airport project.</p><p>The federal government announced in October it would  expropriate more than 10,000 acres of land to build the new  international airport, sparking protests by local farmers.</p><p>Residents of San Salvador Atenco and other nearby villages  oppose the new airport because they will lose their land. The  government has offered compensation but farmers say they will  not sell their land at any price.</p><p>Transport and Communications Minister Pedro Cerisola on  Friday said there was no question the government would budge  from its plans to build the new airport in the area.</p><p>Protests against the airport turned violent Thursday with  clashes in San Salvador Atenco and the nearby town of Santa  Catarina.</p><p>Thirty people were reported injured, including several  police. At least one police officer was attacked with a machete  and another two seriously injured.</p><p>Farmers used cars and trucks to block a major highway and  other roads into the area and torched several vehicles,  including at least three police cars Thursday.</p><p>Friday the protests were calmer.</p><p>"We are not going to give up this battle. We will go on,  come what may," said one protester who did not give her name.</p><p>The proposed six-runway, $2 billion airport is the biggest  public works project to be announced by the government of  President Vicente Fox since it took office in December 2000.</p>
<p>Mexico City's current airport has only two main runways and cannot be expanded 
because it lies in a busy urban area.
