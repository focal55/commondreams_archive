<p>PRESIDENT BUSH will propose next week that Russia and the United States join forces to develop the controversial Star Wars missile defense system in a move that will further enshrine new strategic links between the former foes. </p>
<p>The proposals, which have been discussed in detail by officials from both countries, mark a dramatic shift by President Putin, who has opposed American plans for the missile defense system, known as NMD (National Missile Defense), for the past year.</p>
<P>Mr Bush and Mr Putin will disclose at a meeting in Russia next week that they are to set up a joint committee to develop NMD. The announcement will accompany the signing of a treaty to cut both countries’ nuclear arsenals by thousands of warheads, which Mr Bush described this week as signaling the end of the Cold War. 
<P>The groundwork for the discussions about the missile defense system was laid on Tuesday by John Bolton, the US Under-Secretary of State, at a meeting in Moscow with Georgy Mamedov, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister. 
<P>A US official said that the meeting focused on the future strategic direction of the missile defense system. Mr Bush will offer to share American technology with Russia in joint projects to develop the system, while Russia is expected to offer strategic advice. 
<P>Ronald Reagan first mooted a plan to co-operate with Russia on a Star Wars missile shield when he was President 20 years ago, but the project was considered too costly and too controversial to pursue. 
<P>Until now Mr Putin has opposed the NMD plans because he believed that the system could encourage rogue nations, such as Iraq, to begin a renewed arms race in an effort to surmount the technology. 
<P>Last year, after a meeting with Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, the Secretary-General of NATO, Mr Putin offered to cooperate in developing a rival project with European countries. His apparent motive then, however, was not one of true co-operation but to further drive a wedge between Europe and the US over Mr Bush’s plans for NMD. 
<P>The proposed alliance will come as America prepares to abandon the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia, which prohibits such missile defense systems. Mr Bush announced in December that the US would scrap the treaty in June, giving the Pentagon a six-month run-up to prepare for testing the system, which will be built in Alaska. 
<P>The US is expected to begin work to install missile silos and radar systems at the Fort Greely military base on June 14. Fort Greely is the proposed site for land-based interceptor missiles, which are designed to shoot down long-range ballistic missiles. 
<P>A senior Administration official said yesterday that the cooperation on missile defense would “elaborate the extent of the collaboration” between the US and Russia. “We want to further open up channels,” the official said. “I think Russia realizes that withdrawal from the ABM treaty is now inevitable and that we have to make progress beyond that.” 
<P>The Bush Administration’s proposed defense budget for next year includes $7.8 billion (£5.3 billion) for missile defense and projected spending for the following four years that exceeds $30 billion. 
<P>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Star Wars project could cost as much as $64 billion by 2015. 
<P>After two days of meetings with NATO ministers in Iceland this week Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, lauded the arms control breakthrough with Russia, an expanded NATO-Russia partnership and the tighter UN military sanctions against Iraq, which had won approval with Moscow’s help. </P>
