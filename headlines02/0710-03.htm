<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->President 
George Bush yesterday proposed doubling the maximum prison sentence for corporate 
fraud and blamed the excesses of the dotcom era for the wave of financial scandals 
in the US in the past six months. 
<P>In a speech to business leaders on Wall Street, the US president detailed measures 
to restore shattered confidence in the financial system. "The business pages of 
American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet," he said. 
<P>Shareholders and workers in the US have been stunned by a series of frauds, 
insider dealing and corporate greed that have toppled some of the nation's biggest 
companies. 
<P>The fear of further scandals has brought stock markets back to the lows they 
hit after September 11. They have also become a political liability for the Bush 
administration in the run-up to mid-term elections in November. 
<P>Mr Bush said the maximum prison sentence for executives found to be committing 
fraud should be increased from five to 10 years and perpetrators should be forced 
to return any gains made on the crime. He called for a new era of integrity among 
business leaders. 
<P>"There is a difference between ambition and destructive greed," he said. "These 
scandals have hurt the reputations of many good and honest companies. They have 
hurt the stock market and, worst of all, they're hurting millions of people who 
depend on the integrity of businesses for their livelihood and their retirement." 
<P>Mr Bush ordered the creation of a corporate fraud task force within the department 
of justice. He said laws covering obstruction of justice and document shredding 
would be beefed up, in a clear nod to the Enron scandal. 
<P>An additional $100m (&#163;64.7m) was promised for the chief financial regulator, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is buckling under the weight of 
new cases. The sum was less than the SEC had been seeking. 
<P>The president backed proposals from the New York stock exchange for all share 
option plans to be approved by investors, and said compensation packages should 
be explained in "plain English" in annual reports. He also urged companies to 
stop giving loans to senior directors: the former chief executive of WorldCom, 
Bernie Ebbers, received loans of $408m from his company. 
<P>The speech was widely criticized for not going far enough. Eliot Spitzer, the 
New York attorney general, who threatened legal action against Wall Street bank 
Merrill Lynch over alleged misleading advice, described the proposals as "enormously 
disappointing". 
<P>The house of representatives Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt, said: "So 
far the administration's approach has been a familiar strategy: use harsh rhetoric 
to condemn wrongdoers while delaying and watering down whatever reforms might 
have come out of Congress." 
<P>Shares on Wall Street were trading marginally lower after the speech. 
<P>The seeds for the current scandals at firms including Enron, Xerox, WorldCom 
and Tyco were sown during the "anything goes" hi-tech boom, Mr Bush said. "A lot 
of money was made but too often standards were tossed out." 
<P>Many of the proposals echoed plans by other politicians or financial watchdogs. 
They included an attempt to remove conflicts of interest by limiting the amount 
of consulting work that can be carried out by a company's auditor. This is part 
of a bill being debated in Congress that would also see the creation of an independent 
board to oversee the profession.</p>
