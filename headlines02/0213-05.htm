THORAI, Afghanistan, Feb. 12 — When a bomb landed just outside his home, blowing out windows and demolishing a wall, Qudratullah decided that his family should flee. Theirs was a panicked attempt to leave the area of Tirin Kot, a Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan that was being bombed that October night.
<P> Mr. Qudratullah, 22, a farmer, and a neighbor, Fazel Rabi, loaded up a tractor and trailer with their families and neighboring women and children. That night, Oct. 21, American planes were attacking a military base and a police station in Tirin Kot, and, Mr. Qudratullah's family said today, they also struck repeatedly at the women and children in flight.</P> <P> 
Twenty-one people from two families died that night, survivors said, 17 children, 3 women and the man who was driving the tractor. The youngest to die was just 1 1/2, the oldest only 25, a mother whose three children also died.
<P> Most of the children were killed when a plane struck the tractor-trailer on the road leading out of town, the survivors said. Then, they said, as relatives rushed to the scene and carried the wounded into a house, the planes returned and bombed the house, killing most of the wounded and injuring four who tried to help.</P> <P> "We were trying to escape, so we took all the children in one trailer to get away," said Radigul, 23, Mr. Rabi's wife, who lost three children in the attack and was badly wounded herself. "We thought to get to safety, to relatives, somewhere in the mountains."</P> <P> A spokesman for the United States Central Command said tonight that the target of the Oct. 21 strike was a suspected Taliban command facility, and that imagery taken after the strike showed no civilian casualties.</P> <P> "It was outside the city, a compound we had been watching for a couple of days," said Lt. Col. Jim Yonts. "We verified the target and on the night of the 21st, we dropped some precision-guided munitions on the target, and destroyed that target. All the munitions were accounted for — on the target."</P> <P> Later in the war, this town became the site of fighting between Hamid Karzai, the Pashtun leader who is now the country's interim leader, and the Taliban. On this night, though, the survivors said, the Taliban had fled. The tractor was traveling alone and it was unclear whether there was any reason why the Americans would have thought the house was used by the Taliban. They said they did not see any sign of anti- aircraft fire from the ground.</P> <P> The families fled their homes heading west out of town with Abdul Ghani, 22, at the wheel. Mr. Qudratullah and Mr. Rabi headed home to protect their property. Farther along, the tractor stopped for a brother of Mr. Qudratullah, Nasratullah, 16, to fetch his mother and sister, when they heard planes. </P> <P> "I saw a flash in the sky, and the planes came very low so we turned out the lights of the tractor," Ms. Radigul said in an interview in the courtyard of her home in this village, a mile west of Tirin Kot. "We were so afraid. We thought they were going to hit us. There was no time to get off. I do not remember anything about the bomb but it was a great misery and sorrow for us."</P> <P> It was the children sitting in the front end of the trailer who bore the brunt of the attack, survivors said. Jamila, 25, a sister-in-law of Mr. Qudratullah who was carrying her 1- year-old son, Ashiqullah, in her arms, survived because she was sitting at the back. But in the front, her three other children, Ghaziullah, 7, Muzlifa, 6, and Waheedullah, 5, died. "I never saw them again," she said. </P> <P> Gulfari, 16, Mr. Qudratullah's sister, was splattered with blood and body parts. "I was completely blinded," she said in a whisper, covering her face with a green shawl. "When I put my hand up I felt blood. It was like meat, and I threw it away. I could not see anything. My brother took me from the trailer and cleaned my eyes."</P> <P> The trailer still lies beside the road several hundred yards from the scene, a hole in its floor from a rocket strike.</P> <P> Salam Jan, who lives near the scene of the attack, rushed out and found three women coming toward his house. "They were crying and coming this way," he said. "There was a fire at the tractor and I tried to put it out with my shawl." He said that he saw Mr. Ghani, the driver, on the ground, moaning.</P> <P> Mr. Rabi, 30, had not yet reached home when he heard the explosion and raced back. "The first thing I saw was the feet of a child on the road and then I saw them lying on the trailer," he said. "Some were unconscious and the children were crying. I found my wife on the trailer and carried her here and I found my sons dead on the trailer."</P> <P> Terrified of using lamps that could attract more planes, they worked in the dark and carried the wounded to the guest room, attached to Mr. Jan's house, Mr. Jan said. Mr. Qudratullah's family was taken to another neighbor's house.</P> <P> "We were standing outside talking about getting a car to take them to a doctor when we heard planes coming again," Mr. Jan said. He shouted to the other men to run inside and ducked down within the entrance gates. Barely 30 minutes after the first strike, two explosions blew apart his guest house and toppled the compound wall on top of him. </P> <P> That attack killed everyone who was still alive in the guest room, flinging their bodies yards away or burying them in the rubble, witnesses said. Inside the house, the room where the rest of the wounded lay was also hit, but the people escaped further injury. Then, 10 minutes later, the planes returned a third time and bombed the trailer, flinging it and leaving a deep crater by the road.</P> <P> In the morning, survivors said, they found two women flung into a stream below the house and later dug seven or eight bodies from the rubble. Then they went to the tractor and picked up body parts they could not see in the dark, said Mauladad, a relative who came to help.</P> <P> Fearful that the planes might return again, they carried the bodies up a nearby hill and buried them, laying six people in one long grave, four in another. "They were in pieces, and we could not recognize all of them," Mr. Rabi said.</P> <P> Silk flags and ribbons flutter above the graves now beneath the snow- dusted mountains. But the feelings of the families and survivors are bitter.</P> <P> The planes had attacked the Taliban military base on the east of town and then the police station at 8 p.m, they said. Both buildings today show the results of precise bombing. But then half an hour later a rocket landed a mile west of the town, right outside Mr. Qudratullah's house, witnesses said. </P> <P> "I don't know why they hit here," said his father, Hayatullah, gesturing at his mud-walled house and the apricot orchards in front. "The Taliban were over there at the police station, a mile away."</P> <P> Mr. Rabi said: "The Americans always say they can see the smallest thing on the ground, so then they can see women and children. And the Taliban do not move around in tractors anyway."</P>
