</font></font></font></font></font></font>The groups argue that the U.S. cannot 
authorize more funds for the controversial program until it can rule out health 
and environmental risks from the spraying. 
<p> The State Department report, which includes comments by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), was submitted 
to Congress on September 4 to comply with the requirements of the 2002 foreign 
appropriations act. The Act requires a determination and report by the Secretary 
of State that chemicals used in the aerial eradication of coca crops in Colombia 
do not pose unreasonable health or safety risks to humans or the environment. 
<p> But reviews by a variety of experts charge that the State Department report 
does more to underscore the risks and uncertainties associated with the program 
than to assess and rule out potential impacts to humans and the environment. 
<p> "It is impossible for the State Department to report that there are no unacceptable 
adverse impacts associated with the eradication program without first conducting 
a thorough analysis of all potential impacts," said Dr. Anna Cederstav, a staff 
scientist with Earthjustice and the Interamerican Association for Environmental 
Defense. 
<p> Among the information lacking from the State Department report is an analysis 
of how the continual relocation of coca fields after crops have been destroyed 
is impacting the environment. Each time coca farmers move their crops, they deforest 
a new area, opening it to further development, the report charges. 
<p> "It appears that this impact has been ignored to date," Cederstav added. "This 
is a grave and unacceptable omission." 
<p> Earthjustice's criticisms of the report, along with five other reviews, were 
provided to the members of Congress in charge of evaluating the State Department 
report's compliance with the conditions of the 2002 foreign appropriations act. 
<p> Under the Kenneth M. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related 
Programs Appropriations Act of 2002, the State Department cannot purchase additional 
chemicals for the aerial eradication program until it reports to Congress that 
the program is carried out in accordance with U.S. regulatory controls and Colombian 
law. 
<p> The State Department must also demonstrate that the spraying causes no unreasonable 
risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment; that alternative development 
programs are in place in sprayed areas; and that a system is in place to evaluate 
citizens' claims of health harms or damage to legal food crops, and provide compensation 
for valid claims. 
<p> The aerial fumigation program, which the U.S. finances as part of its multibillion 
dollar Colombian aid package, is designed to eradicate coca and other plants used 
to manufacture illicit drugs. But critics say the program indiscriminately wipes 
out legitimate subsistence crops as well as natural plants, and kills birds, mammals 
and aquatic life. 
<p> The chemicals are applied by aircraft and frequently fall on Columbia's indigenous 
peoples, subjecting them to a variety of health afflictions, critics add. 
<p> The aerial spray mixture contains three components: water, an EPA registered 
formulation of the herbicide glyphosate, and Cosmo-Flux 411F, a surfactant produced 
in Colombia that helps the herbicide to penetrate the waxy surface of the coca 
leaves. 
<p> Glyphosate is manufactured by the U.S. based Monsanto Corporation and is commonly 
referred to by the trade name Roundup. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide, 
meaning that any plant exposed to a sufficient amount of the chemical will be 
killed. 
<p> The chemical has been sprayed over tens of thousands of acres in Colombia 
since the early 1990s, but critics note that the eradication program has done 
little to curtail the supply of cocaine that comes into the U.S. every year. 
<p> The State Department's conclusion that glyphosate spraying is safe is based 
heavily on input from the EPA and the USDA. The USDA told the State Department 
that testing by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) shows that glyphosate 
"poses minimal health risks to humans and animals, is environmentally benign, 
and degrades rapidly in soil and water." 
<p> "It is USDA's determination that the risks involved with using glyphosate 
with commercially available adjuvants for narcotics eradication are minimal" added 
Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman. 
<p> But the independent reviewers charge that the EPA and USDA failed to consider 
most impacts on Colombia's native species and tribes. 
<p> "Colombia is a global biodiversity hotspot and one-third of its reported plant 
species are not found anywhere else in the world," notes Dr. Ivette Perfecto, 
professor of tropical ecology at the University of Michigan. "Yet, the EPA analysis 
does not examine potential risks to these species unique to Colombia, nor does 
it examine the potential impacts on endangered species in the affected regions." 
<p> Dr. Ted Schettler, science director at the Science and Environmental Health 
Network argues that the EPA review does not include enough exposure or toxicity 
information about glyphosate to prove that it can be safely applied near human 
habitations. 
<p> "In each of the categories for risk assessment, EPA's analysis fails to provide 
essential information," Schettler writes. "Most notably, the toxicity of the herbicide 
mixture is never fully assessed, and the analysis of human exposure is based on 
unwarranted assumptions about compliance with safety protocols." 
<p> "Without a detailed evaluation of exposures as well as the toxicity of the 
substance being used, an investigation of the spraying program is seriously flawed," 
Schettler said. 
<p> The EPA pointed out that the State Department did not provide the results 
of glyphosate toxicological tests commissioned by the Bureau for International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, because the tests were not completed in 
time for the report. The EPA reported that without these results, it could not 
evaluate the toxicity of the spray mixture that the U.S. is using in Colombia. 
<p> "In the absence of these testing results, EPA recommended that the Department 
consider using an alternative glyphosate product with lower potential for acute 
toxicity," the State Department said. Such an alternative was registered in July 
2002, and the State Department "plans to switch to it for use in Colombia as soon 
as it can be manufactured, purchased and delivered." 
<p> The primary risk the EPA did identify is a potential for "acute eye toxicity, 
due to an inert ingredient in the particular glyphosate formulation used by the 
program," according to the State Department report. That risk is limited mostly 
to the handlers and mixers of concentrated glyphosate, rather than the general 
public. 
<p> The U.S. Embassy in Colombia is working with the Colombian government to warn 
local citizens in areas where spraying is planned, and inform them of precautions 
to take in case of possible incidental contact with the spray mixture. 
<p> "Based on the above information, we do not believe that EPA's reservation 
about the risk of eye irritation rises to the threshold of 'unreasonable risks' 
or 'adverse effects' to humans or the environment identified in the statute," 
the State Department wrote. 
<p> However, the reviews by the scientists and advocacy groups charge that a number 
of concerns that the EPA raised in their analysis were minimized or ignored in 
the final State Department report to Congress. 
<p> Critics note that the herbicide spraying threatens a traditional way of life 
for the Colombian people, because it destroys their crops and farmlands. Dr. Janet 
Chernela, chair of the Committee for Human Rights of the American Anthropological 
Association says the State Department report failed to consider the health and 
cultural impacts to the more than 58 native peoples living in the tropical lowlands 
affected by the aerial coca spraying. 
<p> "These nations have lived in their territories for hundreds, and in some cases, 
thousands, of years," Chernela noted. "Displacement caused by herbicidal spraying 
and violence seriously threatens the rights of aboriginal peoples to inhabit lands 
belonging to them; it also brings about social and economic disruption affecting 
every aspect of life." 
<p> Under the Colombian aid package, the United States is required to provide 
alternative development options and financial compensation for farmers affected 
by the spraying. Lisa Haugaard, executive director of the Latin America Working 
Group, says the State Department report fails to prove that its program complies 
with these requirements. 
<p> "Aerial spraying, whether through drift, accident or intention, is destroying 
the food crops of farmers who have agreed to eradicate drug crops and, even worse, 
of farmers and indigenous communities who are innocent of drug production," Haugaard 
writes. "The compensation system required by Congress exists on paper, but not 
in practice. Of 1,000 claims filed by Colombian farmers for damages, 800 were 
dismissed sight unseen, and the only claim determined to be valid has not yet 
been paid." 
<p> "Plan Colombia was sold to the U.S. Congress as a balanced package, with alternative 
development aid to help farmers transition to legal crops. Yet those programs 
lag shamefully behind, while spraying expands exponentially," adds Haugaard. 
<p> Until these problems can be corrected, the reviewers argue that the Colombian 
aerial spraying program should be shut down. 
<p> "Because the Department of State has not provided sufficient information" 
on the herbicide formulation, its toxic properties and environmental impacts and 
other controversial issues, the agency's report does not meet Congressional requirements, 
concludes Earthjustice's Anna Cederstav. "In light of this fact, we recommend 
that the Appropriations Committee withhold financial support for the aerial eradication 
program." </p>
