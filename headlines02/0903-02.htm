<p>A MASSIVE 71 per cent of Britons are against the nation joining a war on Iraq 
without UN approval, a Mirror poll reveals today.</p>
<p>The figure is almost 20 per cent higher than a week ago - when 52 per cent 
said Britain should NOT support US policy on Iraq - showing how swiftly the public 
is turning against involvement.</p>
<p>More than half the people in this country also believe President Bush to be 
the third biggest threat to world peace after Osama bin Laden and Iraqi tyrant 
Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The poll findings will make unpleasant reading for Tony Blair as he prepares 
to defy public hostility and argue for Britain joining a US attack on Iraq.</p>
<p>Last night, amid growing calls for the Premier to end his talk of war, senior 
Labour MP and Father of the House Tam Dalyell declared: "This is a spectacular 
comment on the British people's feelings.</p>
<p>"The more they think and learn about the prospect of war with Iraq, the less 
they like it. Blair is being damaged. If you ask me if I think his own position 
is in jeopardy, I'd say yes."</p>
<p>The survey was carried out for the Daily Mirror and GMTV by <a href="http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/default.htm" target="_new">ICM 
Research</a> to mark the forthcoming anniversary of the murderous September 11 
skyjack attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.</p>
<p>Only 12 per cent thought an invasion of Iraq was justified under any circumstances. 
Forty one per cent thought it would be acceptable with UN agreement while 35 per 
cent said it could not be justified at all.</p>
<p>Worryingly for Mr Blair almost two out of five people believe he is Mr Bush's 
poodle, while 26 per cent have a lower opinion of him since September 11.</p>
<p>As the Premier's stock falls, there are increasingly gloomy fears for the future.</p>
<p>Thirty one per cent believe another major terrorist attack is "very likely" 
and seven per cent say an attack is "inevitable".</p>
<p>More than 60 per cent believe war is more likely since September 11, almost 
one in 10 say there will be nuclear war in the next five years and fewer than 
half think nuclear weapons will never be used.</p>
<p>The pessimistic outlook is partly caused by what is seen as a failed war on 
terror.</p>
<p>Only 16 per cent say it has been a success while 31 per cent say it has been 
a failure or a big failure.</p>
<p>Britons were split on whether the deaths of innocent civilians in Afghanistan 
were justified in the drive to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>There is a clear difference in the opinions of the sexes in the aftermath of 
September 11.</p>
<p>Women feel less safe since then (36 per cent compared to 26 per cent of men), 
are more nervous about traveling by air (40 to 24 per cent) and feel closer to 
their families (18 to 14 per cent).</p>
<p>But the poll shows the biggest impact of September 11 is not how we live but 
what we think about our leaders.</p>
<p>In the first weeks after the outrage there was enormous support for Mr Bush 
and Mr Blair, and their determination to wage war on terrorism.</p>
<p>A year later, more and more people are critical of what has been done. They 
are deeply unhappy about the chance of being plunged into conflict, possibly without 
UN backing, with Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Blair will fly back to Britain from the Earth Summit in Africa tomorrow 
to insist action must be taken against Saddam. He is expected to use his monthly 
press briefing to send a strong message of support to Mr Bush. But he will again 
refuse to provide any evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, or to publish 
a dossier outlining Iraqi treachery.</p>
<p>Appearing to confirm suspicions that the West is struggling to provide conclusive 
proof against Saddam, a senior No 10 source said: "We will not publish the dossier 
until we are ready.</p>
<p>"The Premier will tackle head-on the reasons why doing nothing to stop Saddam 
Hussein is not an option. He believes there is a strong case for dealing with 
the issue of weapons of mass destruction."</p>
<p>Anti-war Labour MP Alice Mahon said: "I'm not surprised by the Mirror poll. 
Britain has a unique opportunity to avert this looming war. Tony should say 'no' 
now."</p>
<p>Labour MP Diane Abbott, one of about 100 Labour MPs who have backed a Commons 
motion against war on Iraq, said: "This shows why Tony Blair should not be so 
determined to play Robin to George Bush's Batman."</p>
<p>Lib Dem spokesman Menzies Campbell said: "I'm not surprised by these results. 
It's what people are saying and writing to me.</p>
<p>"The British public have seen the debate raging between the hawks and the realists 
in the US - and have obviously opted for realism."</p>
<p>Iraq said yesterday the US was spreading lies about weapons of mass destruction 
- "without providing any evidence which can be verified" - to soften up world 
opinion for a strike.</p>
