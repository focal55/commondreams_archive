<p>UN experts visited a crop-spraying facility and factories for missile casings and aircraft engines on a fourth day of arms inspections overshadowed by a Western air raid that killed at least eight Iraqis.</p>

</table>Twenty more people were injured when warplanes bombed the premises of the Southern Oil Company in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, residents told AFP by telephone Sunday.</p>
<p>The raid came as Baghdad accused Britain and the United States of looking for any pretext for war despite the successful relaunch of UN disarmament checks last week.</p>
<p>Journalists were kept out as a team from the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) toured the crop-spraying facility run by the agriculture ministry in this town some 25 kilometres (15 miles) south-east of the capital.</p>
<p>Inspectors parked a four-wheel drive across the entrance to prevent anyone else from going in or out.</p>
<p>Several light aircraft with crop-dusting equipment could be seen around a courtyard among numerous single-storey buildings.</p>
<p>Before the 1991 Gulf war, the centre housed a secret project on the "Zubaidi system" using light aircraft and helicopters to deliver chemical or biological agents as weapons.</p>
<p>Iraq finally admitted to the United Nations in 1995 to having run a bacteriological weapons programme and went on to detail aerosol dispersion techniques.</p>
<p>Baghdad says the equipment involved has been destroyed and the programmes halted, however weapons inspectors have not accepted that Iraq has disclosed all its germ warfare activities.</p>
<p>Britain has alleged that Iraq still possesses the capacity to deliver weapons via crop-spraying techniques.</p>
<p>A second team of experts meanwhile visited the bin Firnass and al-Quds plants in the huge al-Taji compound northeast of the capital, both of which have been involved in the production of the Samud short-range missile, which UN rules still allow Baghdad to possess.</p>
<p>"We gave the inspectors every assistance and answered all their questions," bin Firnass director Brahim Hussein told reporters after the inspection.</p>
<p>Al-Quds director General Khaled Atallah Aboud said his plant had only worked on short-range missiles since 1992 but had not been able to produce a single one because of a lack of electronic components.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the visits conducted Sunday were no-notice inspections or visits to restore monitoring equipment left by the previous UN mission withdrawn in 1998.</p>
<p>UN spokesman Hiro Ueki acknowledged Saturday night that Iraqi officials were told in advance about two of the visits earlier in the day so they could help with the repair of surveillance gear.</p>
<p>Sunday's inspections were overshadowed by the Western air raid on Basra, the latest in a series of escalating clashes between Iraqi air defences and British and US warplanes patrolling no-fly zones in the south and north.</p>
<p>Between 600 and 700 employees were in the oil company premises when two Western rockets hit at 11:00 am (0800 GMT), slightly injuring many passers-by with shards of glass in addition to the 20 more seriously wounded, residents said.</p>
<p>Baghdad, which refuses to recognize the air exclusion zones enforced by London and Washington since after the 1991 Gulf war, regularly accuses the allied planes of targeting civilian facilities.</p>
<p>The ruling Baath party's daily Ath-Thawrah accused the Anglo-Saxon allies Sunday of "becoming more aggressive" since the relaunch of the UN disarmament process.</p>
<p>"Their aim is not to verify that Iraq no long has these weapons but to find any excuse to attack," the paper said Sunday.</p>
<p>"The UN teams have found nothing in recent days and will find nothing in coming days."</p>
<p>Resolution 1441 adopted by the Security Council on November 8 resolution gives UN inspectors unprecedented powers to search for the forbidden arms Baghdad strongly denies having.</p>
<p>Inspectors from UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have 
not reported anything untoward from the site checks completed on Wednesday, Thursday 
and Saturday.</p>
