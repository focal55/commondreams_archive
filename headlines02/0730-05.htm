<p>Military commanders on both sides of the Atlantic are privately expressing 
deep unease about American plans to invade Iraq, believing they are ill thought 
out with the strategy to achieve the ultimate objective - toppling Saddam Hussein 
- far from clear. 
<P>It will be a "gargantuan task" which could spark off a conflagration across 
the Middle East, a European military official warned yesterday. 
<P>A senior British military source said it was clear there was a "desire of the 
US government &#91;to attack Iraq&#93; on their own if necessary". He added: "We 
are scratching our heads to see what could make strategic sense." 
<P>US contingency plans include: heavy air strikes combined with a relatively 
small invasion force of 5,000 troops; a force of some 50,000 troops which could 
be deployed quickly deep inside Iraq; and a massive ground force of 250,000 US 
troops supported by 25,000 British soldiers. 
<P>All the options are described by a British military source as "high risk". 
British military planners - under Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, the chief of the 
defense staff known for his cautious approach and retiring next spring - are reluctantly 
drawing up their own contingency plans in the event of an expected request from 
Washington for support. 
<P>Some British military sources suggest the US plans, leaked by the Pentagon, 
are merely psychological warfare on Washington's part. Their preferred option 
is to continue the existing policy of containment combined with attempts to destabilize 
the regime. 
<P>In pursuit of the "containment" option, American bombers, supported by RAF 
aircraft, on Sunday attacked a communications site in southern Iraq, the US central 
command revealed yesterday. It was the sixth such strike this month in response 
to what the US said were hostile actions by Iraq. 
<P>Growing concern among senior members of the armed forces about the wisdom of 
invading Iraq was echoed yesterday by General Sir Michael Rose, a former head 
of the SAS and of UN forces in Bosnia. 
<P>In an article in London's Evening Standard under the heading: "The madness 
of going to war with Iraq", he said: "There are huge political and military risks 
associated with launching large scale ground forces into Iraq." 
<P>A former chief of defense staff, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, warned in a letter 
to the Times that an invasion of Iraq would pour "petrol rather than water" on 
the flames and provide al-Qaida with more recruits. He quoted a predecessor who 
said during the 1956 Suez crisis: "Of course we can get to Cairo but what I want 
to know is what the bloody hell do we do when we get there?" 
<P>Retired top military personnel frequently express the opinions of serving senior 
officers. These misgivings about an Iraqi military adventure echo apprehension 
among senior uniformed officers on the other side of the Atlantic, clear splits 
have emerged between America's professional soldiers and the gung ho civilian 
leaders in the White House and the Pentagon. 
<P>In briefings calculated to query the administration's persistent saber rattling 
towards Iraq, unnamed officers told the Washington Post that the policy of containment 
was working well and that the alternative, a military assault, was too riddled 
with risk to be worth pursuing. The officers even questioned the motivation behind 
the Bush administration's preoccupation with ousting Saddam as part of a wider 
"war on terror". One general described as being "involved in the Afghanistan war" 
suggested it could be a matter of settling scores for the Bush family, after an 
alleged Iraqi plot to assassinate the president's father during a 1993 visit to 
Kuwait. "I'm not aware of any linkage to al-Qaida or terrorism," the general said, 
"so I have to wonder if this has something to do with his father being targeted 
by Saddam." 
<P>But another uniformed officer at the Pentagon played down the importance of 
the dissenting voices. "Has there ever been a single military operation where 
you haven't had some voices wondering whether it's a good idea? Probably not," 
the officer told the Guardian. 
<P>Michael O'Hanlon, a strategic analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank 
in Washington also argued that the reports of uniform-civilian splits had been 
exaggerated. "If there are more than one or two on the joint chiefs of staff who 
are against it, I'd be surprised," he said. "The thrust is how you do it and when 
you do it. They're not questioning the president's decision on whether to do it." 
<P>But he said senior officers were also concerned about "the casual march to 
war" being pursued by hawks in the administration, who portrayed the operation 
as relatively risk-free. 
<P>Richard Perle, a Pentagon adviser and an advocate of an assault on Iraq, rejected 
the anxiety voiced as irrelevant. The decision to take on Saddam, he said, was 
"a political judgment that these guys aren't competent to make". </p>
