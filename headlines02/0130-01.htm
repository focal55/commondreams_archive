</table>Activists say they worry Canada will cave in to Crompton
Corporation, which has filed suit against the Canadian government
for banning the pesticide lindane. Officials in Ottawa have
capitulated in similar challenges filed under NAFTA's investment
protection provisions, known as Chapter 11, they note. <P>
''Canada must not allow foreign investors to dictate through
Chapter 11 the approach it takes to regulating substances as
dangerous as lindane,'' environmental advocacy groups in Canada,
Europe, Mexico, and the United States say in a letter to Canadian
authorities. <P>
Crompton notified Canadian authorities in November that it would
pursue a 100 million dollar NAFTA claim against Canada for de-
registering lindane for use on Canadian canola crops. <P>
Crompton charges that by banning the pesticide and "failing to
live up to its undertaking to conduct a review of lindane, the
government has taken measures tantamount to expropriation.'' <P>
''There is no scientific basis for banning the use of lindane
product for canola seeds as there is no conclusive scientific
evidence that such action is necessary to protect human health or
the environment,'' its complaint states. <P>
Marc Richard, spokesperson for the Canadian Pesticide Management
Regulatory Agency, says the sides are discussing the issue. Under
NAFTA, Crompton and Ottawa have 90 days to work out a compromise
before the company can move the dispute process further. <P>
Canada, explains Richard, did not ban the use of lindane for
canola directly because of health or environmental concerns.
Rather, it de-registered the use of lindane for canola seed after
it became a trade dispute with the United States, which forbids
the use of the pesticide on canola. 
<P>
In 1998, Washington warned Ottawa it would block imports of crops
treated with pesticides not allowed for use in the United States.
US canola growers, prevented by US law from using the chemical
to treat their seed, had complained that the higher cost of
lindane substitutes gave Canadian growers an unfair competitive
advantage. 
<P>
In response, Canadian authorities, canola growers, and
manufacturers of lindane - including Crompton unit Uniroyal
Chemical - had agreed to phase out lindane, says Richard. 
<P>
While Crompton argues that lindane is safe, the activist <a href="http://www.panna.org/panna/" target="_new">Pesticide
Action Network</a> says lindane is highly toxic and lists the
pesticide as one of the ''dirty dozen'' pesticides. 
<P>
Lindane is considered a persistent organic pollutant, or POP,
because it travels long distances and breaks down extremely
slowly. The documented health effects of lindane include
dizziness, seizures, nervous system damage, immune system damage,
and birth defects. 
<P>
In Europe, all agricultural uses of lindane have been banned. The
US Environmental Protection Agency has called the pesticide a
possible human carcinogen and is currently completing a scientific
review of the chemical. 
<P>
''No government should be forced to import such a toxin,'' says
Kristin Schafer of Pesticide Action Network North America. <P>
The Stockholm Convention on POPs, adopted and signed by 90
countries in May, does not yet cover lindane but discussions are
under way to ban the pesticide. 
<P>
The letter to Canadian authorities from several dozen groups
including Greenpeace and the Washington-based Center for
International Environmental Law, calls on the government to
neither pay the money demanded by Crompton nor settle the lawsuit. 
<P>
''Canada must demonstrate that it will not let narrow corporate
interests dictate the health of its citizens,'' says Angela
Rickman, with Sierra Club Canada. <P>
In July 1998, Ottawa withdrew its ban on the gasoline additive MMT
and paid 13 million dollars in damages to the U.S.-based Ethyl
Corporation, which had brought a NAFTA challenge against the
prohibition. <P>
This time around, the environmental groups also are calling for
action to limit the scope of Chapter 11, saying its provisions
have been used as a ''key offensive strategic tool'' for
corporations to fight laws that interfere with their ability to
make a profit through exports. <P>
''Ambiguities in the provisions of Chapter 11 have been used to
tip the balance of the investor-state mechanism against the
ability of governments to regulate in the public interest,'' says
their letter. <P>
Corporations in each of the three NAFTA countries - Canada,
Mexico, and the United States - have filed at least seven other
cases challenging domestic environmental and health policies. <P>
In 2000, a NAFTA tribunal ruled that Mexico violated the trade
agreement and ordered the government to pay 16.7 million dollars
to the U.S.-based Metalclad corporation. The company had wanted to
open a hazardous waste treatment and disposal site in central
Mexico but local government said the project violated
environmental protection laws. <P>
Another pending claim involves the Canadian-based company
Methanex, which filed against the United States claiming that the
state of California's decision to phase out the use of its
gasoline additive, MTBE, cost the company 970 million dollars. <P>
California's governor, Gray Davis, ordered the use of MTBE halted
by the end of this year after studies revealed unusually high -
and potentially harmful - levels of MTBE in California's drinking
water. <P>
''NAFTA Parties should reopen and renegotiate the provisions of
Chapter 11,'' says the letter, '' to ensure the ability of
national and sub-national governments to protect their citizens
and the environment from toxic substances.''
