<p>The U.S. military needs to hasten funding and development of nonlethal weapons, 
including chemicals that could be used to calm or control crowds who might threaten 
U.S. bases abroad, according to a report by the National Research Council. 
<P>The report released Monday drew a harsh reaction from peace activists, especially 
in light of the unintended civilian casualties last week in Moscow, where Russian 
soldiers used a sleep-inducing gas against Chechen hostage- takers in a Moscow 
theater. The gas killed many civilians in the theater, especially the very young 
and the elderly. 
<P>Gases and other "nonlethal weapons are an additional way to provide greater 
security for military bases and protect our forces," said Miriam E. John, vice 
president of Sandia National Laboratories's California branch in Livermore. She 
chaired the committee that wrote the report. 
<P>Especially worthwhile would be the development of "calmative" gases that can 
calm large groups, or "malodorant" -- foul smelling -- gases that can repel them, 
says the report, titled "An Assessment of Nonlethal Weapons Science and Technology." 
<P>The report also urges the military to beef up its development of other so- 
called nonlethal weapons, which would "incapacitate people or materiel while minimizing 
unintended death and damage." 
<P>These include "a vehicle-mounted system that uses heat produced by high- power 
microwaves to stop vehicles and vessels" without harming the occupants, and robotic 
vehicles and sensors that can track potential enemy threats. 
<P>The NRC is the principal operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences 
and National Academy of Engineering, which advise Congress on science and technology. 
<P>The report's conclusions are intended for perusal by the military in general, 
although the report itself was developed by an NRC branch with ties to Navy and 
Marine Corps operations. 
<P>Peace activists attacked the report as unwise and ill-timed, particularly in 
the aftermath of the Moscow tragedy. 
<P>"They're talking about upgrading a whole new piece of the military- industrial 
complex," charged Andrew Lichterman, a spokesman for Oakland-based Western States 
Legal Foundation, one of the leading peace groups in the western United States. 
"We're not having the national debate we need about what these massive military 
forces are for." 
<P>The NRC report is "terribly, terribly irresponsible" and biased by its ties 
to the military, said Edward Hammond, head of The Sunshine Project. The Austin, 
<P>Texas-based group has critiqued U.S. weapons developments including so-called 
nonlethal technologies. 
<P>The Pentagon agency charged with developing nonlethal weapons is the six- year-old 
Joint Nonlethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). That agency "got what it wanted in 
the (NRC) study: a green light to continue development of gas weapons," Hammond 
charged. 
<P>In the late 20th century, U.S. military futurists began advocating research 
and development of such nonlethal weapons to minimize civilian and enemy casualties 
in wartime. On Congressional order, the U.S. Defense Department responded in 1996 
by creating the JNLWD as a branch of the U.S. Marine Corps. 
<P>However, the Navy "has made little investment in nonlethal weapons science 
and technology," complained the NRC report. The report was sponsored by two of 
the agencies that would benefit from increased funding: the Directorate and the 
Office of Naval Research. 
<P>In a phone interview, John, a chemist by training, said the directorate spends 
roughly $30 million a year. So far it has spent its money largely on low-tech 
nonlethal devices such as rubber bullets and "sticky foam," which can bog down 
crowds. 
<P>Although the report doesn't recommend a specific amount of increased spending 
for R&D on nonlethal weapons, John said the military should consider doubling 
the amount -- especially on higher-tech weapons such as the calming or smelly 
gases.</p>
