<p>JOHANNESBURG - With a call for an end to the "global apartheid" between rich 
and poor ringing in their ears, delegates to the Earth Summit in Johannesburg 
began talks on Monday aimed at relieving poverty and healing the planet.
<p>As rooftop sharpshooters and battalions of police and  troops shielded them from the risk of angry protests, host  president Thabo Mbeki of South Africa told the representatives  of nearly 200 governments that it was time to scrap a world  order based on the "savage principle of the survival of the  fittest."

</table></font>"A global human society based on poverty for many and prosperity for a few, 
characterized by islands of wealth, surrounded by a sea of poverty, is unsustainable," 
he told the opening session of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
<span class="newsContent">Delegates crowded the plush Sandton convention center, just  a short walk from some of Africa's most squalid slums. Inside,  idealistic campaigners showed off the benefits of solar cooking  stoves while outside the South African armed forces put on an  impressive display of hardware to discourage violent protests.<p>Mbeki, who said on Sunday that "global apartheid" must go  the same way as white minority rule in South Africa, criticized  the failure of governments to act on pledges made 10 years ago  in Rio de Janeiro to pursue environmentally friendly  prosperity.<p>But after preparatory talks at the weekend, negotiators  still face an uphill struggle over the next 10 days to narrow a  gulf between poor nations seeking more aid and fairer trade and  wealthy powers led by the United States and European Union, who  want to see better government in the Third World in return.<p>One focus for dispute could be Robert Mugabe, president of  neighboring Zimbabwe and a target of bitter Western criticism  over human rights abuses and seizures of white-owned farmland.<p>BUSH ABSENT<p>World leaders are due in Johannesburg next week, hoping to  sign a broad "implementation plan" that the UN organizers hope  will revive the spirit of Rio on a wide range of issues, from  improving healthcare to saving rainforests and fish stocks.<p>"This is not a conference to solve every single problem.  But this is a test -- we have to come out with credible  commitments for action," the summit's UN organizer Nitin Desai  said.<p>But critics point out that, as in Rio, the texts under  discussion are vague and not legally binding. President Bush  does not even plan to attend, prompting fury among critics  already dismayed by his rejection last year of the Kyoto accord  to cut the air pollution blamed for global warming.<p>There has been little sign of the sort of mass street  protests that have marred international meetings in Seattle,  Genoa and elsewhere. But Johannesburg police, still shaking off  an apartheid-era reputation for brutality, are taking no  chances, clamping down hard on small protests.  Anger is brewing among environmental campaigners at what they  perceive as a drive by Americans and Europeans to push the  demands of globalized big business above those of the very  poor.<p>"There is a possibility the two worlds will never touch,"  Paul Mayer of the Tribal Link Foundation said after a visit to  the Alexandra shanty town, overlooking the Sandton summit  venue.<p>"When we make foreign policy we should always have children  in mind and I always fear those people in their thousand-dollar  suits, staying in their luxury hotels, don't do that."<p>The United Nations was expected to release on Monday a list  of partnerships between governments and private enterprise that  have won its approval for helping the poor and the environment.<p>Washington is a strong advocate of such initiatives, but  critics say they are a way of evading state responsibilities.<p>A DOLLAR A DAY<p>Developing nations say already agreed U.N. goals that  should form part of the Johannesburg plan require more Western  aid if they are to be met and also want to see new commitments  from the rich states to open up their markets to Third World  produce.<p>A key goal is to halve the proportion of the population --  at present 1.2 billion people -- living on less than a dollar a  day compared to an average in Europe of about 60 times that.<p>Subsidies to American and European farmers already account  for several times the total global annual aid budget of $54  billion and mean farmers in developing nations cannot compete.<p>But Western negotiators are resisting efforts to reopen  negotiations on aid and trade that have already been concluded  in separate meetings, at Monterrey and Doha, in the past year.<p>A senior member of the U.S. delegation, to be headed by  Secretary of State Colin Powell, urged developing countries to  be realistic in "tough negotiations." He said: "We just can't  let ourselves get trapped and mired in some of these issues."<p>European Union officials said they were open to some of the  poor states' demands for more concrete targets but were  reluctant to push ahead without the United States.<p>"We're willing to be held accountable but we want our  partners to join us," said Catherine Day, a senior EU official.<p>The summit will concentrate the work of its thousands of  official delegates on five key areas -- cleaner water,  non-polluting energy, better health, sustainable agriculture  and preserving the "biodiversity" of the Earth's many species.<p>The UN's Desai highlighted links between all the issues.  Educating women pulled communities out of poverty, he said. And  a good way to do that in many arid regions of Africa and Asia  was to provide fresh water, sparing girls long walks to wells.
<p>Healthcare was on the agenda on Monday. One South African in nine suffers from 
HIV/AIDS, which has decimated Africa's workforce and left millions of children 
without parents.</span>
