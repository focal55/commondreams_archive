            <p>The Madison Metropolitan School District is restricting students 
              from addressing controversial topics unless their forums include 
              equal time for contrasting views. 
            <p>The administration staked out its position Monday afternoon when 
              a last-bell announcement at Madison Memorial High School told students 
              that an optional assembly today, which would have hosted three speakers 
              opposed to war with Iraq, was postponed. 
            <p>Until some hawks could be found to balance the discussion, the 
              administration felt that it violated a line of policy that says: 
              &#034;The study of and the teaching of controversial issues shall 
              be in an academic atmosphere as free as possible from bias and prejudice.&#034; 
            <p>That decision, which was reached and ordered by Superintendent 
              Art Rainwater, came after a morning of talk radio that again skewered 
              the district as subversive and anti-American.
            <p>For nearly a month, a group of 20 students had worked to organize 
              the anti-war teach-in. They enlisted the help of social studies 
              teacher Pat Calchina and had clustered posters advertising the event 
              around the school. 
            <p>The speakers were to include Vietnam veteran Will William, peace 
              activist Rae Vogeler and Progressive magazine Editor Matthew Rothschild. 
              It was to have been open to anyone during seventh and eighth hours, 
              followed by an after-school reception for refreshments and more 
              discussion. 
            <p>&#034;Organizing it was really a powerful experience,&#034; said 
              Memorial sophomore Rachael Blumenfeld. &#034;It made me feel like 
              I was a big part of something.&#034; 
            <p>&#034;We all have our opinions, but getting a chance to really 
              express them and share our view - and really touch other people 
              - was a great experience. We worked really hard on it,&#034; Blumenfeld 
              said. 
            <p>Blumenfeld said her detractors, who made &#034;derogatory remarks&#034; 
              and tore down posters, were not meant to be excluded from discussing 
              Iraq. 
            <p>&#034;They&#039;re more than welcome to organize a teach-in from 
              their point of view - in fact, we encouraged them to. But they just 
              didn&#039;t get it together,&#034; she said. 
            <p>After the posters went up on the walls, and some were torn down 
              to skid around the floors, a group of students involved in the Young 
              Republicans organization began complaining that the school was going 
              to sanction a message biased against their views. They said they 
              weren&#039;t being included. 
            <p>Principal Pam Nash, as well as the students who organized the teach-in, 
              invited the students to organize their own assembly, a teacher at 
              the school said, or find their own pro-war speakers to participate. 
            <p>Neither offer was taken, and Monday morning the perception among 
              the conservative students that they had been slighted turned more 
              bitter - and it was being broadcast on AM talk radio. 
            <p>Memorial High School student Andrew Schneider was on air with WTDY/AM 
              1670 host Chris Krok - who had drummed up anti-School Board sentiment 
              last year when the board resisted mandated daily classroom recitations 
              of the Pledge of Allegiance. 
            <p>Those who spoke on the radio show gave slightly different variations 
              on the theme that the school was engaged in some sort of thought 
              control, and it was stifling voices from outside the left. 
            <p>Some of the talk, too, was critical of Calchina, the teacher who 
              was helping the students organize the assembly. 
            <p>Calchina, who teaches women&#039;s history and other classes in 
              the social studies department, had faced controversy last spring 
              when she helped a group of girls build an American flag made of 
              bras to celebrate women&#039;s history month. The project, after 
              some hand-wringing by district administrators, won the adulation 
              of local politicians and a call from Oprah Winfrey&#039;s cable 
              TV network. 
            <p>Calchina said she&#039;s concerned about the position the district 
              took Monday, and is bewildered by the line of policy used to justify 
              it. 
            <p>&#034;Where does it end?&#034; she said. 
            <p>To illustrate her frustration, she gave an example of how Ron Greer, 
              a conservative, anti-gay former candidate for Congress, visited 
              the school during the week before the November election. 
            <p>She said she attended his talk, which was before classes started 
              but during the paid school day. 
            <p>&#034;There was no opposing viewpoint,&#034; Calchina said. &#034;I 
              went, and so did students, and we politely asked questions.&#034; 
            <p>&#034;But in no way did we go on talk radio,&#034; she said. 
            <p>Calchina said she was upset by reports that she had been heavily 
              criticized on the air. Despite being told not to talk to the media, 
              she said she had to respond to what she called &#034;outright lies 
              in an incredibly hateful manner.&#034; 
            <p>&#034;I didn&#039;t want to step on any toes, but I also felt like 
              - my God, I&#039;m the one being put out there as a demagogic teacher 
              brainwashing my students, so I needed to speak. I needed to speak.&#034; 
            <p>&#034;I defended the right to dissent in a democracy and said that 
              this is all part of the educational process.&#034; 
            <p>Blumenfeld said she and her fellow students did not intend their 
              teach-in to be politically balanced - rather, it was meant to be 
              rather one-sided to counteract what they see as a national bias 
              toward war. 
            <p>&#034;We&#039;re just trying to present a pro-peace side,&#034; 
              she said. 
            <p>For that, Blumenfeld said that &#034;our posters were ripped down 
              by teachers and students.&#034; 
            <p>&#034;It was just incredible, the amount of anger people had just 
              for having a teach-in. 
            <p>&#034;People see it as anti-American. I think when we&#039;re doing 
              something that&#039;s against our president&#039;s policy, people 
              see us as attacking the American government. 
            <p>&#034;I think what America truly is, is discussion. I think what 
              a real patriot is, is someone who says what they believe in, even 
              if it&#039;s not the most popular thing - someone who just strives 
              to make America better. Not necessarily by agreeing with power, 
              but by demanding a better government and just demanding that their 
              voice be heard. 
            <p>&#034;I think that&#039;s what makes our country so great, or what 
              should make it so great,&#034; Blumenfeld said. 
            <p>Calchina said she and her students have tentatively rescheduled 
              the teach-in for Dec. 13, provided opposition speakers can be arranged. 
            <p>&#034;If they are not able to dig anyone up, I will,&#034; she 
              said, &#034;because these kids are so disappointed.&#034; 
            <p>&#034;We were so excited about this beautiful event that we were 
              going to put on,&#034; Calchina said. &#034;But I do believe that 
              this is a very teachable moment. If they can just hold on, on Dec. 
              13 we can have an even better event. We really can. I have no qualms 
              about the opposition being there.&#034;
