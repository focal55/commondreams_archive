<p>JACK Straw will announce this week a new era of realpolitik, ending any pretence 
of Britain having an ethical foreign policy, when he unveils guidelines allowing 
for a significant relaxation in the rules governing arms exports. 
<p> In a move which has split the Cabinet, the Foreign Secretary will make a statement 
to parliament announcing a "modification" to the rules on arms sales to reflect 
the "new reality" of the multinational defense projects. 
<p> The change in policy has been pushed through by Downing Street to allow British-made 
components for F16 fighter planes to leave the country - despite being destined 
for aircraft bought by the Israeli government. 
<p> Labour back-benchers and Opposition MPs condemned the changes , accusing the 
government of breaking its own guidelines, agreed with EU colleagues in 1999, 
which forbid the sale of arms when there is a "clear risk" of them being used 
for internal repression or aggression abroad. 
<p> Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats’ foreign affairs spokesman, said Mr 
Straw’s statement would mark the final nail in the coffin for a foreign policy 
with an "ethical dimension" - the much-criticized ambition put forward by Robin 
Cook when he became Foreign Secretary in 1997. The new regulations will allow 
the British-designed "heads up" cockpit for the F16 to leave the country for the 
United States, even though the planes are ultimately destined for Ariel Sharon’s 
government in Israel. 
<p> The shift in British policy is understood to have divided the Cabinet, causing 
major arguments between the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defense, the Department 
of Trade and Industry and Downing Street. 
<p> Tony Blair signaled the change in policy last month when he dismissed criticism 
that Britain was undermining negotiations over Kashmir between Pakistan and India 
because it was selling arms to both countries. 
<p> "The idea that we shut down our defense industry in these circumstances I 
find bizarre," said the Prime Minister at the time. 
<p> Mr Blair, backed by Geoff Hoon, the Defense Secretary, is reported to have 
lent on the Foreign Office, fearing that, unless the guidelines are redrawn, British 
defense contractors could be excluded in the future from lucrative multinational 
projects. 
<p> But Whitehall sources have told The Scotsman that the government had no option 
to striking a deal with the Americans as it could not trust the US not to pass 
on the "heads up" technology to the Israelis. 
<p> "This is about whether or not we trust the Americans," said the source, before 
adding: "There is a lot of angst about the move in higher reaches of government." 
<p> The Foreign Office has consistently struggled to keep to its ambition of having 
an "ethical dimension" to policy-making. This year alone there have been Whitehall 
turf wars over the sale of a British-made military air traffic control system 
to Tanzania and the decision on whether to suspend arms export licenses to India 
and Pakistan. 
<p> Labour has also been embroiled in rows over the export of Hawk jets to Zimbabwe 
in 2000 and the sale of the same type of fighter aircraft to Indonesia in 1999. 
<p> Mr Campbell said the new rulings rode roughshod over an agreement signed with 
Britain’s EU partners setting out a new code of conduct for arms sales. 
<p> "The government hailed its agreement on an EU-wide set of criteria for arms 
exports as one of its greatest achievements," he said. "It now looks as if Britain 
is going to vary these criteria unilaterally. This is bound to cause a row with 
our EU partners. 
<p> "Following up on the willingness to continue to issue arms export licenses 
for India and Pakistan during a period of great tension, any change of this kind 
in export criteria will be seen as a further nail in the coffin of a foreign policy 
with an ethical dimension," he said. 
<p> A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Straw was not announcing a change in policy. 
"It is guidance about existing criteria which take account of the new reality 
of multinational assembly lines for defense contracts. It addresses the multinational 
aspects of arms exports. 
<p> "There is no new policy on Israel or any other specific country. Each individual 
export licence is judged on a case-by-case basis," he said. 
<p> The Campaign Against Arms Trade accused the government of allowing the interests 
of Britain’s arms export industry to take precedence over ethical concerns. 
<p> "They have been arming India and Pakistan even while they stood on the brink 
of nuclear war. Now they are choosing to contribute directly to death and destruction 
in the Middle East."</span></div> </p>
