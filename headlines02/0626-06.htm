<p>Major Israeli and United States peace groups have expressed strong disappointment 
over President George W. Bush's major policy address Monday in which he demanded 
that Palestinians elect "new leaders" as a condition for U.S. support for the 
creation of an independent Palestinian state. 
<p> Most groups said Bush had identified U.S. policy too closely with demands 
made by the government of Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon and had failed to 
provide the Palestinians any concrete hope for ending Israel's 35-year occupation 
of the West Bank and Gaza. 
<p> "The root cause of terrorism and suicide bombing was hardly addressed at all," 
said Adam Keller, spokesperson for the Israeli peace lobby <a href="http://www.gush-shalom.org" target="_new">Gush 
Shalom</a>, referring to the situation of young Palestinians "under an increasingly 
tight occupation, who see themselves oppressed and dispossessed, deprived of all 
hope and expectation for the future, abandoned by the world and who reach the 
point where they decide to blow themselves up in order to kill random Israelis." 
<p> "No end to terrorism can be expected without offering some tangible hope to 
such people, to dry up the phenomenon of suicide bombing at the source," he added. 
<p> Bush, who spoke Monday afternoon in the White House rose garden, called for 
the eventual creation of a Palestinian state that would exist side by side Israel. 
He said if Palestinians cooperated by electing a new leadership and making democratic 
and economic reforms, an interim state could be declared within 18 months, leading 
to a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel three years from now. Such an accord 
would mark the state's permanence. 
<p> But most of his speech, broadcast in news bulletins across the world, consisted 
of demands on the Palestinians, as opposed to Israelis who, he said, should withdraw 
from Palestinian territories and end settlement activity "as we make progress 
towards security." 
<p> "I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised 
by terror," Bush declared. "When the Palestinian people have new leaders, new 
institutions, and new security arrangements with their neighbors, the United States 
of America will support the creation of a Palestinian state." 
<p> Aside from calling for elections at the local level by the end of the year 
and national elections soon after, Bush's plan offered little in the way of specifics 
about how these could be held, particularly in light of Israel's new moves to 
effectively reoccupy major cities in the West Bank, moves that have intensified 
over the past week. 
<p>"There's no firm American time line, no visible interventionist role Washington 
plays in this," said Mark Rosenblum, a top official at <a href="http://www.peacenow.org" target="_new">Americans 
for Peace Now</a> (APN). While APN endorses Bush's final vision of two states 
living side by side, Rosenblum said in a telephone interview from Israel, the 
speech was "very vague" on details about how to get there given "the current situation 
of murder and mayhem." 
<p> Rosenblum also criticized Bush's demand that Palestinian Authority president 
Yasser Arafat be replaced. "While we have found Arafat to have been a very problematic 
partner, this is a strange way to promote democracy, insisting that the Palestinians 
elect someone to the president's liking or they will not get what he says they 
have a right to get: a Palestinian state living peace and security." 
<p> James Zogby, president of the <a href="http://www.aaiusa.org/" target="_new">Arab-American 
Institute</a>, which worked closely with APN in support of the Oslo peace process, 
reacted in a similar vein and expressed concern that Bush had given Sharon a green 
light to pursue military operations in the Palestinian territories. 
<p> "There is nothing here that could give the Palestinians hope; in fact, as 
we are already seeing, what the president did was allow the Sharon government 
to continue its repressive military occupation of Palestinian land," he said. 
"The president has set U.S. foreign policy and U.S.-Arab relations back with today's 
announcement." 
<p> "Once more, the president's plan ignores any responsibility on the part of 
Israel and asks the Palestinians to create a fully functional democratic state 
before they earn the right to a provisional state," he said, adding that Arab 
Americans were "gravely disappointed" with Bush's remarks.
