<p>A SECRET blueprint for US global domination reveals that President Bush and 
his cabinet were planning a premeditated attack on Iraq to secure 'regime change' 
even before he took power in January 2001.
<p>The blueprint, uncovered by the Sunday Herald, for the creation of a 'global 
Pax Americana' was drawn up for Dick Cheney (now vice- president), Donald Rumsfeld 
(defense secretary), Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld's deputy), George W Bush's younger 
brother Jeb and Lewis Libby (Cheney's chief of staff). The document, entitled 
Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces And Resources For A New Century, 
was written in September 2000 by the neo-conservative think-tank <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/" target="_new">Project 
for the New American Century</a> (PNAC).
<p> The plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf 
region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power. It says: 'The United States 
has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. 
While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, 
the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the 
issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.'
<p>The PNAC document supports a 'blueprint for maintaining global US pre-eminence, 
precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security 
order in line with American principles and interests'.
<p> This 'American grand strategy' must be advanced for 'as far into the future 
as possible', the report says. It also calls for the US to 'fight and decisively 
win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars' as a 'core mission'. 
<p> The report describes American armed forces abroad as 'the cavalry on the new 
American frontier'. The PNAC blueprint supports an earlier document written by 
Wolfowitz and Libby that said the US must 'discourage advanced industrial nations 
from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or global 
role'.
<p>The PNAC report also:
<p> 
<ul>
<li>refers to key allies such as the UK as 'the most effective and efficient means 
of exercising American global leadership';</li>
<li>describes peace-keeping missions as 'demanding American political leadership 
rather than that of the United Nations';</li>
<li>reveals worries in the administration that Europe could rival the USA;</li>
<li>says 'even should Saddam pass from the scene' bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 
will remain permanently -- despite domestic opposition in the Gulf regimes to 
the stationing of US troops -- as 'Iran may well prove as large a threat to US 
interests as Iraq has';</li>
<li>spotlights China for 'regime change' saying 'it is time to increase the presence 
of American forces in southeast Asia'. This, it says, may lead to 'American and 
allied power providing the spur to the process of democratization in China';</li>
<li>calls for the creation of 'US Space Forces', to dominate space, and the total 
control of cyberspace to prevent 'enemies' using the internet against the US;</li>
<li>hints that, despite threatening war against Iraq for developing weapons of 
mass destruction, the US may consider developing biological weapons -- which the 
nation has banned -- in decades to come. It says: 'New methods of attack -- electronic, 
'non-lethal', biological -- will be more widely available ... combat likely will 
take place in new dimensions, in space, cyberspace, and perhaps the world of microbes 
... advanced forms of biological warfare that can 'target' specific genotypes 
may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful 
tool';</li>
<li>and pinpoints North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran as dangerous regimes and 
says their existence justifies the creation of a 'world-wide command-and-control 
system'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP, father of the House of Commons and one of the leading 
rebel voices against war with Iraq, said: 'This is garbage from right-wing think-tanks 
stuffed with chicken-hawks -- men who have never seen the horror of war but are 
in love with the idea of war. Men like Cheney, who were draft-dodgers in the Vietnam 
war.
<p> 'This is a blueprint for US world domination -- a new world order of their 
making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control 
the world. I am appalled that a British Labour Prime Minister should have got 
into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.'
