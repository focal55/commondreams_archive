<p>As drug companies blanket patients and doctors with ads touting their newest 
prescription drugs, the federal agency charged with keeping them honest and protecting 
the public appears to be backing off from policing those promotions. 
<P> The Food and Drug Administration demanded that companies fix distortions in 
ads only 18 times this year through September, down from 64 times for all of last 
year, despite rapid growth in the number of ads and leaflets promoting drugs. 
In addition, the FDA is actively considering whether it should loosen rules governing 
ad content. 
<P> Together, critics say, these actions could put the public's health at risk 
and help push drug spending - now at $154 billion - even higher as patients buy 
drugs they don't need. 
<P> ''There's been a dramatic drop in enforcement actions,'' said US Representative 
Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who has protested to the Bush administration 
about the trend. 
<P> ''The FDA seems to be siding with the industry to give them special treatment 
at the expense of the public. The public is going to be misled,'' Waxman said. 
''People may end up paying higher prices for drugs that will do them less good.'' 
<P> The FDA's chief counsel, however, said the agency remains committed to stopping 
false or misleading advertising. Daniel Troy said advertising oversight is focusing 
on fewer, more complicated cases, although he could not offer a specific example. 
Troy also said he is trying to ensure that every FDA action can stand up in court. 
<P> ''We are not backing off the regulation of advertising any more than the courts 
compel us to,'' he said. ''Counting numbers is not in my judgment a very good 
way of assessing how credible and how strong an agency is in enforcing the law.'' 
<P> Some critics suggest that Troy himself is behind the decline since his office 
became the gatekeeper for enforcement letters only recently and since he had challenged 
the FDA's authority over some aspects of drug promotion while he was a lawyer 
in private practice. Troy is also overseeing the agency's public examination of 
whether the FDA's regulation of drug promotions violates manufacturers' free speech 
rights. But Troy calls those criticisms ''politically motivated.'' 
<P> The approximately 63 percent fall-off in FDA enforcement letters is occurring 
amid a public debate over the impact of drug advertising. Drug companies spent 
more than $19 billion last year to promote their drugs to consumers as well as 
doctors, nearly double the amount spent just four years earlier when the FDA eased 
rules on ads targeting consumers, according to IMS Health, which tracks the drug 
industry. 
<P> Ads directed at consumers represented an estimated $2.7 billion last year, 
and this year, the FDA is expected to review the content of a record 300 consumer 
ads and more than 35,000 pieces of promotional literature. Complaints to the agency 
about the content of the ads - typically from doctors, consumer advocates, or 
competitors - appear fairly stable, suggesting there has been no dramatic change 
in the accuracy or fairness of those ads. 
<P> At the same time, there has been a 60 percent decline since last year in the 
number of all FDA warning letters for various types of infractions, from clinical 
trials to marketing. These letters represent the first step in FDA policing. The 
decline coincides with an order from the administration last December requiring 
that Troy's office review all enforcement letters before they are sent to ensure 
they consistently apply FDA rules and are legally sound. Critics say the policy, 
combined with Troy's background, has had a chilling effect on FDA staff members 
who monitor drug company actions. 
<P> ''The FDA is supposed to be a watchdog for patients, not a lapdog for special 
interests,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs 
the Senate's health committee. ''The precipitous drop in warning letters is an 
early warning signal that the administration may be planning to weaken an agency 
that is vital to the health of every American family.'' 
<P> Troy said his oversight is not to blame for the decrease, because his office 
has rejected just 6 percent of the letters reviewed from February through September, 
including only two letters on advertising. 
<P> He said he couldn't fully explain the drop-off, but contended the agency is 
focusing on quality instead of quantity. ''We want to make sure what we do is 
credible and legally supportable and that everyone knows we can back it up by 
court action,'' he said. 
<P> However, Troy said that companies have generally responded quickly to enforcement 
letters on advertising by changing the content and that they have not challenged 
the letters in court. And he acknowledged that some FDA staff may be ''self-censoring.'' 
<P> Protecting consumers from dishonest advertising is one of the FDA's main responsibilities 
under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Rules require ads to contain balanced 
information about the risks and the benefits, although television and radio ads 
may greatly summarize the discussion of side effects. 
<P> FDA staff members review the material, focusing particularly on ads that are 
the subject of complaints, and send ''letters of notification'' or ''warning letters'' 
if they find problems. 
<P> One ad the FDA recently challenged promoted Lipitor, a top-selling cholesterol-lowering 
drug. The FDA said Pfizer Inc.'s ad in Time and Reader's Digest falsely implied 
that Lipitor was safer than its competitors. A company spokeswoman said Pfizer 
revised the ad immediately. 
<P> Waxman, however, said the FDA lets some misleading claims continue, such as 
a television ad that promotes the popular sleeping pill Ambien as ''working like 
a dream.'' Waxman said, ''The ad underplayed the risk of addiction. '' While the 
announcer says ''patients who abuse prescription sleep aids may become dependent,'' 
specialists who reviewed the ad for Waxman said the drug's labeling says even 
those who don't abuse it may become addicted. 
<P> FDA officials declined comment on the ad, and officials at the drug company, 
Sanofi-Synthelabo, did not respond to phone calls. 
<P> Dr. Peter Lurie, associate director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, 
said the drop-off in warning letters ''acts as a signal to industry that the FDA 
is largely turning a blind eye to this issue,'' and he suggested that the public 
''can expect a rash of more misleading advertising.'' 
<P> But drug industry officials, who have long chafed under FDA ad restrictions, 
say they're not trying to mislead the public or take advantage of changes at the 
FDA. 
<P> ''Any reduction in the number of letters hasn't decreased our focus on FDA 
enforcement,'' said Arnold Friede, senior corporate counsel for Pfizer. 
<P> Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers 
of America, said that lobbying group had ''not seen any decline in the effectiveness 
of FDA regulation.'' 
<P> Recent research has found that ads directed at consumers spur visits to the 
doctor and that most patients who ask their doctors for advertised products get 
them. 
<P> Trewhitt says ''direct-to-consumer ads empower patients by enabling them to 
learn about different treatment options,'' but 59 percent of the patients surveyed 
by the FDA in 1999 said the ads didn't talk enough about the risks. 
<P> Meanwhile, some are concerned the Bush administration will use free speech 
arguments to limit further the FDA's oversight of advertising. After a Supreme 
Court ruling shot down FDA rules barring pharmacies from publicizing custom combinations 
of drugs, the agency asked for public comment on its other advertising rules. 
Thousands of pages of comment include a Pfizer suggestion that the agency drop 
rules requiring mention of side effects in favor of a statement that all drugs 
have risks and that patients should consult their doctors. 
<P> On the other side of the spectrum, Health Law Advocates of Boston argued for 
rules that risks be presented in clearer voice-overs and larger type, and the 
American Medical Association said the FDA should maintain strict oversight to 
protect public health. 
<P> Troy said any policy changes will rest with Mark McClellan, the new commissioner.
