<p>If it was a mass movement that protested the war in Vietnam, it is a massive movement that is taking shape to oppose a possible war on Iraq.<P>	Beyond the tens of thousands who marched in the streets of yesteryear, it is hundreds of thousands who already are signing petitions, writing letters and e-mails and meeting in person with decision makers of the modern day.<P>	Huge demonstrations such as the ones scheduled for Oct. 26 in Washington and San Francisco are still a staple of protest in the 21st century. But this also is a day of mass mobilization made easier, with organization as simple as pushing the "send" button on the home computer. Leaders are everywhere and nowhere.<P>	"I was in demonstrations during the Vietnam War, and in a way, the only thing we had was to get out there in numbers," said Mary Lord, director of the "peace building unit" for the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia. "Some of that is still needed - the sense of people being together is important. But with the Internet, you can see what people are doing locally. You can have a million people doing events. Before, all that went on under the radar screen."<P>	With the war drums sounding in the background, activists are contacting neighbors on local list-serves and turning out hundreds for peace marches. Organized efforts are resulting in hundreds of thousands of people petitioning elected representatives in Washington for peace, supporters say. In one recent fund-raising phenomenon, anti-war activists raised $1 million in 48 hours for four candidates who voted against the resolution granting President Bush the power to attack Iraq unilaterally.<P>	Polls show the public backing the president by nearly a 2-1 margin, although the support drops to less than 50 percent in some surveys when details such as the possibility of mass U.S. casualties are factored in. And the Senate and House supported the war powers resolution in even greater numbers than they did prior to the Persian Gulf War, after Iraq had already overrun Kuwait.<P>	But activists still believe they are having some impact on the president's policies, pointing to the administration's agreement to seek the congressional resolution at all after arguing earlier that it wasn't necessary.<P>	Kevin Sheridan, spokesman for the Republican National Committee in Washington, said "it is their prerogative" for anti-war activists to think they are influencing the president and he conceded that "maybe they turned a vote or two in the House on the Democratic side" last week in the war powers debate.<P>	But the lopsided votes in Congress for the president - 77-23 in the Senate and 296-133 in the House - and the similar margins reflected in public opinion polls show that war protesters aren't convincing America that Bush is on the wrong path, according to Sheridan.<P>	"Clearly, the people of the United States are behind us on this issue - taking a strong stand against Iraq and seeing that Saddam Hussein does not use weapons of mass destruction and that he does not obtain nuclear weapons," Sheridan said. "Obviously, there is going to be with any chance of war a segment of the American population that is going to oppose it. Certainly we are respectful of that. But the president believes the security of the American people and the world is at issue here."<P>	Today's anti-war activism flows from what has become a semi-permanent infrastructure of protest - a "culture of protest," as Sheridan called it. The Quaker-based "Friends" date back to World War I. Peace Action, with 80,000 members and a chapter in Sacramento, has been active since the Gulf War. Then there are the thousands of Vietnam War-era protesters who have remained active on local issues and who are turning out to assist the new movement, organizers say.<P>	There is an element of facelessness to today's opposition, thanks to the Internet.<P>	The Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and other recognized protest leaders have lent their names to the Oct. 26 marches in San Francisco and Washington, which organizers hope will attract 150,000.
<P> "We're getting barraged," said Richard Becker, the western regional coordinator 
for International ANSWER, which is organizing the protests. "We can't handle the 
volumes of calls, e-mails, people coming in to volunteer to help."
