<p>As U.S. House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt stepped away from the crowd 
Sunday in Kennedy Park, the crowd followed.</p>
<p> It was not the crowd that showed up to support Democrat Mike Michaud in his 
run for the House, it was the crowd unhappy with members of Congress, especially 
Gephardt.</p>
<p> “Gephardt, Gephardt has no spine! He just follows Bush’s line,” the crowd 
loudly repeated, holding signs and banging drums, standing a few feet away from 
the high-ranking Democrat. The age of protesters ranged from college students 
to middle-aged parents to white-haired seniors.</p>

The protesters were angry that Gephardt and other congressional leaders signed 
off on a resolution giving Bush the authority to use military action against Iraq. 
That resolution is expected to be taken up in Congress this week.</p>
<p> As Gephardt began to take questions from the news media following the rally, 
Michaud supporters stood between the protesters so reporters could hear what Gephardt 
said. Security was intense, but the event was peaceful and no arrests were made.</p>
<p> When asked for his position on the resolution, Gephardt said military action 
against Iraq must include the United Nations, but that he supports action against 
Iraq.</p>
<p> Debate on the resolution will begin this week, he said. “I felt we need to 
encourage the president to use the United Nations. I think he’s doing that. But 
we’ve got to deal with the problem we face with Iraq,” Gephardt said. “We have 
terrorists and terrorism in the world. We can’t allow that to affect us here in 
the United States. We’ve got to make sure that weapons of mass destruction are 
not used in the United States. We have a high responsibility to make sure that 
doesn’t happen.”</p>
<p> Democrats want Bush “to go to the Security Council and settle this through 
the Security Council,” Gephardt said. “We’ve got to use the United Nations. We’re 
a leader of the United Nations. We set it up. So we’ve got to try to stick with 
it.”</p>
<p> Protesters angrily said agreeing to the resolution is not how Democrats should 
behave.</p>
<p> “Things that are central to many of us in the Democratic Party, he just signed 
off on it,” Chuck Lidz said of Gephardt before the rally. “He’s put a lot of pressure 
on fellow Democrats who tried to raise questions about the war. In Democratic 
Party politics we try to do things internationally, with the cooperation of our 
allies. Bush is not doing that, and Gephardt just signed off on that.”</p>
<p> Bates sophomore Nathan Harrington agreed. “They’re supposed to be the opposition 
party but they don’t oppose,” he said.</p>
<p> “If Bush can convince the entire Security Council that this is the right policy, 
I will shut up,” Lidz said. “I don’t think I’ll agree, but I’ll shut up.” Lidz, 
of Hebron held a sign that read: “Who wants war in Iraq?”</p>
<p> “I want the Democrats to start questioning the insanity of a pre-emptive, 
unilateral invasion of a foreign country,” Harrington said, holding a sign that 
read “no more killing.” “Clearly Saddam Hussein’s regime is a terrible one.” But 
the sanctions have strengthened Hussein’s hold on power and caused suffering to 
the Iraqi people, Harrington said. “An invasion at this point will do the same 
thing.”</p>
<p> Security was tight during Sunday’s rally-protest with numerous Secret Service 
agents, state and local police officers at the scene. While no arrests were made, 
things got tense for a few seconds when a protester rushed toward Gephardt while 
taking something out of his bag, said Lewiston Police Lt. Jim Perkins. Fearing 
it could be a gun or another weapon, officers stopped the man and inspected his 
bag. “It was a camera,” Perkins said, adding the protester understood why he was 
stopped.</p>
