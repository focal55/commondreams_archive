<p>TEHRAN  - 
Iranian President Mohamad Khatami has
accused "a small, but influential group in the United States
(of) threatening the world with war."
<p>
Khatami was speaking on Wednesday during a tour of a
northern province bordering the Caspian Sea, the official IRNA
news agency said on Thursday.
<p>
"We are not so selfish as to accuse all the American nation
of being evil. However there is a small, but influential group
in the United States that is threatening the world with war
through their violent and war-mongering policies," IRNA quoted
the normally mild-mannered president as saying.
<p>
"We have a national, religious and humanitarian duty to
defend our country and we will not surrender to any aggressor,"
Khatami said.
<p>
Sharp rhetoric from Washington has sparked fierce debate in
Tehran, which President George Bush accuses of forming part of
an "axis of evil."
<p>
Some Iranian reformists have called for opening talks with
the "Great Satan" and conservatives have demanded an end to
dissent for the sake of national unity.
<p>
"We don't accuse the United States of being part of an axis
of evil, although we believe that what Washington says today is
clear proof of their evil," Khatami said.
<p>
The reformist president has always argued for trying to
repair ties with Washington, but says it should first apologize
for past misdeeds and ease sanctions on Iran.
<p>
Hard-liners who look to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have
ruled out any talks with their arch-enemy which cut ties with
Iran in 1980 after radical students seized dozens of U.S.
diplomats and held them hostage for 444 days.
<p>
HARD-LINER TALKS WITH U.S.?
<p>
Yet reformists have persistently accused conservatives in
the last month of sending delegates to meet U.S. officials in
Europe and on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. They say
talks should be conducted through official government channels.
<p>
Analysts say Khatami's hawkish comments on relations with
Washington in the last week are an attempt to expose alleged
conservative double-standards on the issue.
<p>
Hard-liners have denied conducting talks with U.S.
officials, but a spokesman for Khatami's government said on
Wednesday the Intelligence Ministry had been asked to
investigate the charges.
<p>
Bush said in January that Iran, along with Iraq and North
Korea, formed "an axis of evil" for trying to develop weapons
of mass destruction.
<p>
Other U.S. leaders have since heaped blame on Iran,
accusing the Islamic Republic of harboring al-Qaeda and Taliban
fighters fleeing from neighboring Afghanistan  -- charges Tehran
denies.
<p>
In his speech Khatami also indirectly accused the United
States of interfering in the Caspian Sea, where U.S. companies
are involved in helping other littoral states develop its
potentially rich energy resources.
<p>
"The Caspian Sea should be under the dominion of the five
coastal countries and foreigners should not interfere in it,"
he said. "We want this sea to be a sea of peace and we are
trying to reach a proper legal regime through dialogue and
understanding."
<p>
The coastal states -- Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia
and Turkmenistan -- have failed to agree on how to divide the
sea's resources since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991
which rendered older treaties out of date.</p>
