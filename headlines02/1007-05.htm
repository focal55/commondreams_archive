<p>RIO DE JANEIRO - </b> Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva easily won Sunday's presidential 
elections in Brazil, but failed to garner the majority needed to avoid a run-off 
vote, slated for Oct 27, in nationwide balloting that was bogged down by voters' 
problems with a computerized ballot. 
<p> Lula, 57, leader of the leftist Workers Party (PT) and a former metalworker, 
gave his rivals a run for their money with his Lula President coalition that includes 
the right-leaning Liberal Party, and its José Alencar, textile mogul, as his vice-presidential 
candidate. 
<p> With around 47 percent of the vote, Lula will face José Serra, 60, candidate 
of the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government and of the "Grand Alliance" between 
the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) and the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party (PMDB), two of the country's leading political forces. 
<p> Serra polled at nearly a quarter of the valid votes cast for president Sunday. 
<p> Brazil's Electoral Tribunal was scheduled to announce the official results 
at midnight Sunday (3:00 GMT Monday), but delays involving the computerized ballot 
ruined those plans. 
<p> The Electoral Tribunal, which regulates the voting process, reported that 
less than one percent of the 406,000 electronic ballot boxes used across the country 
presented defects. But in at least 110 voting stations it was necessary to use 
the traditional manual balloting method. 
<p> Even with the second round presidential elections, Lula is considered the 
favorite. The electoral support of the PT is more consolidated than that of the 
other parties, say political analysts. 
<p> Most of the people who cast their ballots for leftists Ciro Gomes or Anthony 
Garotinho, two candidates who won an important portion of the vote (around 13 
and 17 percent, respectively) but not enough to beat Serra, are more likely to 
support Lula. 
<p> Lula's candidacy also received a boost from two former presidents José Sarney 
(1985-1990) and Itamar Franco (1992-1994), both of the PMDB, who threw their support 
behind the metalworker-turned-politician. 
<p> Furthermore, general support for the PT increased in the final days of the 
campaign, as evidenced in several local races, such as the governorship of Sao 
Paulo, Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state. The PT's José Genoina defied 
all predictions and will face current governor Geraldo Alckmin in the run-off 
vote. 
<p> Economist Aloizio Mercadante, PT candidate for the Senate representing Sao 
Paulo, also saw greater than expected support. The rise of the PT in Sao Paulo 
state is decisive for Lula's chances on Oct 27 as it is home to nearly 20 percent 
of the national electorate. 
<p> But the run-off vote "is a different election", say analysts. José Pimenta 
da Veiga, former communications minister and director of Serra's campaign, believes 
it is possible to erase the 20-million-vote advantage Lula had Sunday in the three 
weeks before the second round. 
<p> The debate now will be between just two candidates, and the best one will 
be able to alter the situation, says Da Veiga. 
<p> Meanwhile, in economic and financial circles, it is being assumed that Lula 
will be Brazil's president as of Jan 1, the day that Cardoso ends his second four-year 
term. 
<p> It will be up to him to prevent Brazil's financial collapse under pressures 
of economic crises throughout Latin America, but the major challenge in the next 
four years will be to reduce the country's profound social inequalities and poverty. 
<p> Brazil is among the countries with the biggest gap between rich and poor, 
to the extent that sociologists often use the term "Brazilianization" to describe 
processes in other countries in which the poor distribution of wealth continues 
to worsen. 
<p> The demand for solutions will be especially burdensome for Lula, as he is 
seen as the standard-bearer of movements that have historically been involved 
in social justice issues. 
<p> The gap between rich and poor in this giant South American nation -- home 
to more than 160 million people -- is seen as the result of a series of economic 
crises over the last 20 years. 
<p> Inequalities, impunity and the ease of obtaining weapons are blamed as the 
main causes of the rise in violence that costs Brazil 1.9 percent of its gross 
domestic product (GDP) in medical treatment for its victims, says a World Health 
Organization report released Thursday. 
<p> The percentage of people without enough income to pay for their basic necessities 
was reduced by the implementation in 1994 of Plan Real, which put an end to three 
decades of high inflation, though it has begun an upwards climb again in the last 
three years. 
<p> In 1993, 41.7 percent of the population lived in such a situation, falling 
to 32.7 percent in 1998. But last year, 33.6 percent could not meet their basic 
necessities on their income, reflecting the turning point in 1999, when the financial 
crisis caused a sharp depreciation of the national currency, the real. 
<p> In 2001, 58 million people earned less than they needed to ensure a minimally 
decent standard of living, and of them, at least 22 percent lacked sufficient 
income to maintain adequate nutrition. 
<p> Brazil suffers greater income disparity than Mexico and much more than Argentina, 
and poverty here is not a problem of wealth, but rather of its distribution, according 
to researchers.</p>
