<p>The first-ever World Day Against the Death Penalty blazed forth its message 
with Rome's Colosseum and other monuments around the globe bathed in light displays 
condemning what organizers call a practice from the past like torture and slavery.</p>
<p>Some 60 "Cities for Life" illuminated leading public monuments in the most 
concerted campaign yet against capital punishment.</p>

</table></font>Cities as far apart as Stockholm and Santiago marked the new annual event to 
draw attention to 3,048 people known to have been executed in 31 countries last 
year.</p>
<p>China is by far the most prolific practitioner, with a reported 2,468 people 
put to death and 4,015 handed death sentences in 2001, according to Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Since the United States re-introduced capital punishment in 1976, 810 people 
have been executed there.</p>
<p>Death penalty opponents can point to continued progress in their campaign, 
with a total of 111 countries abolishing it in law or in practice. </p>
<p>Saturday's international demonstration was organized by human rights groups 
and Italy's Roman Catholic Sant'Egidio lay community.</p>
<p>Inspired by Rome, which lights up the Colosseum each time a country abolishes 
capital punishment, organizers asked major world cities to dress a major monument 
in light on November 30.</p>
<p>The Colosseum -- the amphitheater of ancient Rome that stands in the heart 
of the Italian capital -- is lit "each time a human life is saved or a country 
abolishes the death penalty," said Stefania Tallei of the organizing committee.</p>
<p>"A great upturned thumb, the symbol of life, is projected on to the Colosseum 
facade," she explained.</p>
<p>The thumbs-down was the sign which Roman emperors gave at Colosseum spectaculars 
to indicate a beaten gladiator should be given the death-blow. The thumbs-up meant 
his life was spared.</p>
<p>November 30 was chosen because it was on this day in 1786 that the Duchy of 
Tuscany became the first state to abolish capital punishment.</p>
<p>The Tuscan regional government conferred its highest honor, the Silver Banner, 
Saturday on Oklahoma Senator Angela Monson for her abolition campaign, and on 
Afghanistan's former deputy prime minister Sima Samar, now chairman of his country's 
human rights commission.</p>
<p>Venice illuminated its historic Grand Ducal Palace. In Geneva, St Peter's Cathedral 
overlooking the city was to remain floodlit for three days.</p>
<p>Amsterdam illuminated its statue of Mahatma Gandhi, Indian patriot and pacifist 
campaigner against British rule. </p>
<p>Brussels turned the spotlight on its celebrated Atomium, a landmark dating 
from the 1958 World Fair comprising giant spheres reaching up to a combined height 
of 102 meters (330 feet). </p>
<p>In France, mayors representing both left-wing and right-wing parties supported 
a French initiative under the title: "Together against the death penalty," and 
some 20 cities including Paris, Grenoble, Lyon, Rennes and Lille took part.</p>
<p>American anti-death penalty groups did not participate directly but nevertheless 
backed a movement they see as principally directed by Europeans, said David Elliot 
of the US National Coalition against the Death Penalty.</p>
<p>The new event was meant to remind the world that "the death penalty is an instrument 
of the past, like torture and slavery", said Sant'Egidio spokesman Mario Marazziti.</p>
<p>The Community of Sant'Egidio is an association of lay people who believe in 
solidarity with the poor and dialogue to resolve conflict.</p>
<p>There are signs that the fight for abolition is being won.</p>
<p>Of 195 countries monitored by Amnesty International and the US-based Death 
Penalty Information Center (DPIC), 111 countries have abolished executions, the 
latest being Chile and Turkey.</p>
<p>In Europe, where the vast majority have abolished the death penalty, it is 
still nevertheless on the statute book for peacetime crimes in Albania and Russia.</p>
<p>Latin America is also a largely death penalty-free zone, with only Cuba and 
Guatemala still carrying out executions.</p>
<p>In Africa there is a growing tendency towards abolition, with Angola, Ivory 
Coast, Mauritius, Mozambique and South Africa among those to abandon the law in 
recent years. But in Asia and the Middle East it remains very much in force.</p>
