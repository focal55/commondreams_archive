Bal, Ruweng County, Sudan -- The attack came, without any warning, at 9 a.m. First helicopter gunships flew over the  village, scattering families and chasing them into the high grass with rocket and machine-gun fire. Then soldiers drove in, guns blazing, as they jumped out of their trucks. They too pursued the people into the bush, firing indiscriminately. 
<p>Survivors say the helicopters were flying so low -- 'roaming' is a word used time and again -- that they could see the faces of the men shooting at them. The blasts from the helicopters' rotor blades  flattened the grass and men, women and children who thought they were hidden from view became sitting ducks. 
<p>Alai Bol Aguk, a young woman who escaped from Bal, said gunships had threatened the village before but it had never been attacked by ground troops. She said the soldiers shot her two youngest children, but they managed to crawl away into the grass. It was only after she had searched for them for five days that vultures circling overhead finally led her to their bodies. 
<p>Dau Ajing and his two children, aged four and two, also died in the grass. Ador and Migak Thon, Mibek and Woun Deng, Monybeny Kuol and Dau Kur were burned alive as the Sudanese army torched every home in Bal -- a simple mud-and-thatch village a few miles east of the Munga and Umm Segura oilfields drilled by Sudan's largest oil consortium, the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company. 
<p>The neighboring village of Jukabar suffered the same fate as Bal. Gunships killed two men in their 70s, a young mother and two children under six.  Soldiers looted livestock, crops and household goods, burned unharvested sorghum and torched the village. The entire population moved away -- walking east for three consecutive nights for fear of gunships -- after village elders decided that the advance of oil meant Jukabar would never again be safe. 
<p>'The government has planted mines at all the water points, along the paths and in all the farms,' said Chief Chimum Akoljok. 'If we go back, we will die.' 
<p>The 18-year civil war between Sudan's ruling Arab north and underdeveloped but oil-rich African south gained a new dimension in 1999 with the large-scale development of oil by foreign companies and the opening of a pipeline that carries the oil north for refining and export. Human rights investigators, including  successive United Nations' rapporteurs, say wide swathes of southern Sudan sold to foreign oil companies but inhabited by members of the Nuer and Dinka tribes are being depopulated in a systematic drive to clear the land for oil exploration. 
<p>Among the companies that have come under criticism is Glasgow's Weir Pumps. Weir has signed two lucrative contracts for pumping stations that enable oil to be transported through the pipeline. 
<p>The total number of those who died in the attacks on Bal and Jukobar is unlikely ever to be known. 
<p>The United Nations' relief operation for war-affected areas of Sudan, Operation Lifeline Sudan, has had no permanent presence in Ruweng County since the work on the pipeline began. In the absence of outside witnesses, government forces -- and the southern rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army -- enjoy complete impunity. 
<p>Word of the offensive late last year might never have reached the outside world had the European Campaign on Oil in Sudan (ECOS), a coalition of European NGOs including Christian Aid, not sent a human rights lawyer to the area. 
<p>ECOS was launched in May 2001 to lobby European governments and  companies involved in oil to pull out of Sudan until there is agreement on the equitable sharing of Sudan's oil wealth and guarantees that it will not be built on human rights abuses. Lawyer Diane de Guzman said her visit had unearthed new evidence of government abuses. 
<p>
<p>'The human rights abuses are  horrific and systematic,' she said. 'The government is going in, burning the villages, killing people, clearing areas in order for the oil companies to work. 
<p>'I can't believe the companies don't know what's going on. When they come into these locations to work there's nobody there!' 
<p>Sudan's Islamist government denies that its forces are clearing land for foreign companies to drill. It says they are fighting the SPLA, an increasingly cohesive rebel army that in recent months has mounted its first serious challenges to oil. Under SPLA commanders such as Peter Gadet, rebel troops have attacked Talisman in Ruweng county and Lundin Oil in western Upper Nile.
<p>But there is strong evidence that the November government offensive in Ruweng County was directed against civilians -- not against the SPLA. In an SPLA base an eight-hour walk away from Bal, Commander George Athor said the gunships would not have flown so low had they feared a rebel presence on the ground. Hundreds of miles away in New York, meanwhile, a document filed in a civil suit against the government and the Canadian oil company Talisman, the  driving force in the GNPOC, brought the first proof that the Sudanese army has been under orders to 'clean' oil areas. 
<p>The document-- filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows foreigners to use American courts to seek redress for violations of human rights -- is a directive from the government's Petroleum  Security office in Khartoum to its office at GNPOC headquarters in Heglig. 
<p>Marked 'very urgent', it says: 'In  accordance with directives of His  Excellency the Minister of Energy and Mining and fulfilling the request of the Canadian Company ... the armed forces will conduct cleaning-up operations in all villages from Heglig to Pariang', southeast of Heglig. 
<p>The directive is dated May 7, 1999. Two days later, according to several human rights reports, government forces launched a massive offensive in the area, using Antonov bombers, helicopter gunships, tanks and government-supported militias. It lasted two months and affected two-thirds of the villages in the country. 
<p>Sources close to the plaintiffs in New York told the Sunday Herald the directive is part of a damning body of evidence obtained largely from Sudanese people who  initially worked with the government in the hope that oil would bring  development and, through development, peace. Talisman, which has been given a copy of the document, has said its lawyers are examining the document's source and authenticity. 
<p>A spokesman for Talisman, which has consistently denied any knowledge of human rights abuses, said: 'The  suggestions in the alleged memo run  contrary to everything that Talisman  practices and believes in Sudan.' 
<p>
<p>Efforts to hold the oil industry accountable for abuses from which it profits took a big step forward this month when a New York federal court refused to dismiss a lawsuit charging Shell with complicity in human rights  violations in Nigeria's Ogoniland. 
<p>The court found that Shell's alleged actions constituted participation in  violations of international law including crimes against humanity. It ruled that Shell can be held liable for cooperating in the persecution and execution of  environmental activists including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995. 
<p>'This ruling means that the families of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his Ogoni colleagues may yet get some measure of justice for the unlawful executions and other abuses in which Shell was complicit,' said Richard Herz, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. 'More broadly, it sends a strong message to other multinational  companies that they cannot participate in egregious human rights abuses with impunity.'</p>
