DENVER -- "Bombs kill babies," read 15-month-old Bailey Cope's tiny T-shirt. 
<p> Her mother, Heather, wore a shirt that read, "No blood for oil."</p>
<p>The two were protesting a potential war with Iraq at Denver's Civic Center 
on Saturday afternoon as part of a diverse crowd of protesters at a "No War for 
Votes" rally.</p>
<p>Organizers estimated about 4,000 attended; police declined to estimate the 
number of protesters.</p>
<p>"I don't support a war with Iraq," Cope said as Bailey sat in her arms. "I'm 
a mom."</p>
<p>Cope and two friends, Anjanett Payne and Lorrie Spoering, called themselves 
"girlmoms." They said they are members of a radical leftist activist organization 
of women who are also teen mothers, Payne said.</p>
<p>"We're about empowering teen moms and making sure they don't get marginalized 
in society," Payne said.</p>
<p>She also opposes war. "We didn't attack Russia during the Cold War," said Payne, 
a 21-year-old English major at Rutgers University in New Jersey. "If Iraq really 
had the capabilities Bush says it has, I don't think the U.S. would attack."</p>
<p>Although the crowd filled the amphitheater and spilled onto the grass surrounding 
it, most protesters sat peacefully in the warm afternoon sun and listened to the 
lineup of speakers.</p>
<p>The most active part of the demonstration occurred at the end, when protesters 
marched around the park, beating drums and chanting slogans such as "Drop Bush, 
not bombs" and "It's time for a regime change here."</p>
<p>As they marched, passing cars honked and passengers flashed peace signs at 
the protesters.</p>
<p>The rally, which coincided with similar rallies in San Francisco and Washington, 
D.C., was "very peaceful and respectful," Denver police spokeswoman Virginia Lopez 
said.</p>
<p>No arrests were made, Lopez said.</p>
<p>"It was a marvelous display of democracy," said Alan Gilbert, who spoke at 
the rally.</p>
<p>Gilbert, an international studies professor at the University of Denver, said 
he would liked to have seen the rally spread beyond the park.</p>
<p>Protesters Bonnie Kueffner and her husband, Fred, brought her two toddlers 
from Longmont along with about 20 members from their church, First Congregational 
United Church of Christ.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying Saddam Hussein isn't someone who should not be watched," she 
said from behind a colorful stroller. "I just feel we need to be peacemakers in 
the world."</p>
<p>If the United States can invade Iraq, Kueffner said, it can use those same 
tactics to invade other countries.</p>
<p>"I think there are other options," she said.</p>
<p>About 40 Cherry Creek High School student activists who staged a 24-hour fast 
last week added their support to the rally.</p>
<p>"As students, we feel like we are the ones who are going to have to deal with 
the consequences of this war," said 18-year-old Nick Salter, one of the founders 
of the anti-war group Students Taking Opposition Peacefully.</p>
<p>Helen Kress, in town from Arlington, Va., to visit her son and daughter-in-law, 
said she agreed with the young activists.</p>
<p>Kress said she and her husband wanted to attend a demonstration in Washington, 
D.C., but since they couldn't, chose to join Denver's rally.</p>
<p>"It's only the beginning," Gilbert said. "I think people are actually in a 
state of horror about this war."</p>
<p>Organizer Ethan Hemming acknowledged that the crowd was relatively calm, but 
he said they responded to the speakers with energy.</p>
<p>"Like last time, I was particularly impressed by the diversity of the crowd," 
said Hemming, a member of the Colorado Campaign for Middle East Peace. "We had 
parents, children, elderly people."</p>
