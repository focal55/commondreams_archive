<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The 
International Criminal Court (ICC)--the proposed forum for trying alleged perpetrators 
of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity--moved a major step closer 
to reality this week when the government of Estonia became the 50th country to 
ratify the court's founding 1998 treaty. 
<p>Estonia's action means that only 10 more countries must ratify and deposit 
their ratifications with the United Nations before the Rome Statute for the International 
Criminal Court takes effect and the ICC comes into existence. 
<p> "This is quite a milestone," said Richard Dicker, who has been following progress 
in establishing the ICC for New York-based <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human 
Rights Watch</a>. "I think we'll have 60 before the end of June and possibly a 
good deal sooner," he added. 
<p> Europe is so far the region with the largest number of countries that have 
ratified the statute, including all but a small handful of members of the 15-nation 
European Union. A substantial number of nations in West and Southern Africa, the 
Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean have also deposited their ratifications. 
<p> The statute has been signed by 139 nations to date, and, in addition to the 
50 who have ratified it, about two dozen more are in the process of gaining ratification 
powers from their parliaments. 
<p> When the statute was first presented, only seven countries voted against it, 
including China, Israel, Iraq, and the United States. 
<p> In his last days in office, however, former President Bill Clinton--who had 
opposed it largely as a result of pressure from Republican lawmakers and the Pentagon--changed 
his mind and signed it to "reaffirm our strong support for international accountability 
and for bringing to justice perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against 
humanity." 
<p> But Clinton did not submit it to the Senate for ratification, and his successor, 
President George W. Bush, has indicated no interest in doing so. 
<p> Nonetheless, his administration has not actively lobbied other governments 
against ratification, as many ICC advocates and human rights activists had feared. 
<p> Indeed, the administration last month helped persuade Republicans in Congress 
to drop the so-called American Servicemembers Protection Act (ASPA) from the Defense 
Appropriations bill that would have barred all cooperation by local, state, or 
federal authorities with the ICC. 
<p> The ASPA also barred committing U.S. troops to peacekeeping missions unless 
they were explicitly exempted from possible prosecution by the ICC in advance. 
The act even authorized the president to use force in order to free U.S. and allied 
officials or troops if they were detained by the ICC. 
<p> Congress, however, did pass other legislation, later signed into law by Bush, 
that bans the use of government funds to cooperate with the ICC during the current 
fiscal year. 
<p> Republicans and some Democrats have opposed the ICC on the grounds that there 
are not enough safeguards in the statute to protect U.S. soldiers and officials 
from frivolous or politically-motivated prosecutions. 
<p> But advocates have argued that elaborate constraints on prosecuting powers 
were included in the statute precisely to reassure Washington about those concerns. 
Among other provisions, the ICC would only be able to take up a case after it 
had concluded that the government involved was either unable or unwilling to investigate 
or prosecute it on its own. 
<p> With the exception of Turkey, all of Washington's closest military allies 
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have signed the statute and either 
ratified it or are actively pursuing ratification. After initially opposing it, 
Israel has also signed the statute. 
<p> Still, several significant powers, especially in Asia, have declined even 
to sign the statute. Besides China, they include Japan, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia. 
<p> ICC supporters are hoping that, as the goal of 60 ratifications gets closer, 
many countries which have been hostile or on the fence, including even the U.S., 
will come around. 
<p> "If America wants to remain a leader in pursuing international justice for 
the victims of genocide and other heinous crimes, the U.S. government must figure 
out how to work with this court, not against it," said Heather Hamilton, program 
director at the World Federalist Association, which chairs a coalition of groups 
that favors U.S. ratification.
