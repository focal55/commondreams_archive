<p>The US National Academy of Sciences issued a report yesterday strongly backing 
US ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), in a rebuff to the 
Bush administration's policy of shelving the agreement. 
<P>The report was compiled over two years by a panel that included some of the 
country's leading nuclear scientists and the former commander of US forces in 
the Pacific, Charles Larson. It addressed the major security concerns raised by 
the Senate when it refused to ratify the treaty in 1999, and on each issue judged 
that the US would face "a more dangerous world" without the treaty. 
<P>The report was commissioned by the Clinton administration but President George 
Bush views the accord, which has yet to come into force, as unverifiable and a 
constraint on America's ability to develop and test new nuclear weapons. 
<P>Soon after Mr Bush took office, officials examined ways to withdraw the treaty 
from the Senate to ensure it was not ratified, but they were told by legal advisers 
that they had no constitutional power to do so. 
<P>Since then, the treaty has been in limbo, although radical conservatives in 
the administration have continued to press for the US to go further and renounce 
the treaty. 
<P>In December, the Pentagon put forward three options for consideration: one 
involved renunciation of the US signature on the treaty and cutting off all funds 
to the commission in Vienna established to monitor compliance; the second included 
renunciation but continued partial funding for the commission's global network 
of monitors; the third was to maintain the status quo, but the Pentagon made it 
clear this was not its preferred option. 
<P>Moderates at the National Security Council, wary of the diplomatic consequences 
of scrapping the treaty, blocked a high-level discussion on the Pentagon's options, 
in effect, shelving the debate. But as the unilateral US moratorium on nuclear 
tests approaches its 10th anniversary in September, some arms control advocates 
are concerned that the administration could use the occasion to withdraw from 
the CTBT. 
<P>Most diplomatic observers think that is unlikely. But they believe pressure 
from radicals to ditch the moratorium and the treaty will mount during the remaining 
two years of President Bush's first term. 
<P>Pentagon hawks are keen to test a new generation of tactical nuclear missiles 
aimed at destroying deep, heavily reinforced bunkers. The need for such weapons 
was expressed by the administration's nuclear posture review, which was leaked 
earlier this year. The 2003 defense budget earmarks $15.5m (&#163;9.8m) to modify 
existing weapons for that purpose. 
<P>The report by the Academy of Sciences represents a blow to Pentagon radicals. 
<P>It rejects the chief technical criticisms of the treaty: that it would prevent 
the US conducting tests essential to maintain its nuclear readiness, and that 
it was unverifiable because other countries could conduct tests in secret. 
<P>On the first issue, the panel found that "the United States has the technical 
capabilities to maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of its existing 
nuclear-weapon stockpile under the CTBT". It argued that there was an array of 
increasingly sophisticated means of checking and maintaining weapons without nuclear 
tests. 
<P>It also suggested that if the international monitoring system of seismic and 
other sensors being developed by the treaty's preparatory commission in Vienna 
was fully deployed then an underground explosion with as small a yield as 0.1 
kilotons (100 tons) could be "reliably detected". 
<P>The report conceded that if sophisticated masking techniques were used, a rogue 
state could hide a blast of up to two kilotons. 
<P>But the academy maintained that this would be extremely difficult. "A future 
no-CTBT world _ could be a more dangerous world than today's, for the United States 
and for others," the report said. 
<P>Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, welcomed 
the report as a "clear, definitive and authoritative rebuttal" of the administrations 
arguments. 
<P>But Baker Spring, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation, argued 
that the report was incomplete. "It does not address military effectiveness," 
he said. "It assumes the military requirement will forever remain the same." </p>
