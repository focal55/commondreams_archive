<p>WASHINGTON — It is a fact of life on Capitol Hill that new lobbying coalitions 
sprout almost every day to try to influence everything from electricity policy 
to bankruptcy law to health care legislation. </p>
<P> But the rising popularity of such coalitions goes beyond simply a desire to 
influence policy. Thanks to a loophole in the federal lobbying law, some companies 
and individuals — especially those pursuing controversial or potentially embarrassing 
causes — are using coalitions to conceal their identities.</p>
<P> "You can have unpopular causes such as a tobacco interest or one of these 
corporations that have renounced its American citizenship hide their interests 
through this device," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. "You 
can have foreign interests, if they combine with others, hide their involvement 
through this device." </p>
<P> The Congressional Research Service, a part of the Library of Congress, recently 
examined lobbyist registration forms, Congressional testimony and media databases 
and found 135 lobbying coalitions for which it could find only limited information 
or none at all.</p>
<P> One such group, the Section 877 Coalition, has been largely dedicated to keeping 
Congress from tightening the section of the tax law applying to the estates of 
wealthy individuals who gave up their American citizenship.</p>
<P> The coalition paid more than $760,000 to two firms in 2000 and 2001 to press 
its case, disclosure forms filed with Congress by the coalition's lobbyists show. 
But the reports give no clue about precisely who wanted to protect expatriates, 
and some of the group's lobbyists have hardly been forthcoming.</p>
<P> "It is our policy not to comment on client matters, except to note that with 
respect to the registration of these entities, we are in full compliance with 
the letter and the spirit of the law," said Steven Silber, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
which had been one of the lobbying firms for the Section 877 Coalition. This year, 
the accounting firm sold its federal tax lobbying operation.</p>
<P> Only in recent days, after repeated inquiries from a reporter and a request 
from a former lobbyist who now is an official at the Treasury Department, did 
lobbyists say that the coalition was made up of trusts for members of the Arison 
family.</p>
<P> In the 1990's, Congressional Democrats used Ted Arison, the founder of Carnival 
Cruise lines who saved millions in taxes by renouncing his United States citizenship 
and returning to Israel, as a case study of why the tax law should be rewritten. 
Mr. Arison was one of the richest men in the world when he died in 1999. A spokesman 
for the <org idsrc="NYSE" value="CCL">Carnival Corporation</org>, whose chairman 
is Micky Arison, a son of Ted Arison's, referred questions about why the Arison 
family trusts had operated through the Section 877 Coalition to one of the lobbying 
firms, Alcalde & Fay. </p>
<P> At the firm, Hector Alcalde said he had listed the client as the Section 877 
Coalition for "simplicity's sake," because PricewaterhouseCoopers had already 
done so. "There's no hidden agenda," Mr. Alcalde said</p>
<P> Many businesses say they lobby in coalitions not to conceal their identities 
but because it is far more effective to show lawmakers that their cause has large 
numbers of supporter, or because it allows them to pool resources. But the more 
secretive coalitions appear to have been spurred in part by Congressional efforts 
to open lobbying activities to more public scrutiny.</p>
<P> In 1995, Congress passed the first major law to tighten lobbying regulation 
in 49 years, requiring thousands more lobbyists to report who pays them, how much 
they are paid and what issues they work on. President Bill Clinton hailed the 
measure as one that "will help restore the trust of the people in their government."</p>
<P> But the law had an exception involving coalitions. In such cases, lobbyists 
were required to disclose the names of the coalitions that hired them, but not 
the members, except under certain circumstances. Members had to be named only 
if they contributed more than $10,000 to the lobbying activities in a semiannual 
reporting period and exercised substantial control over the coalition's activities.</p>
<P> Seven years later, as coalition lobbying has proliferated, it has turned out 
to be easy for interests to find their way around these disclosure requirements 
simply by spreading out the control of a coalition.</p>
<P> "They don't want to be recognized," said Matt Keller, the legislative director 
of Common Cause, a group that had pushed for more stringent lobbying law.</p>
<P> To be sure, many coalitions do not seek to shield their identities, and their 
lobbyists say they would have a hard time making their case without telling members 
of Congress whom they are representing.</p>
<P> "I want them to know," said Jeff Tassey, a lobbyist for the Coalition for 
Responsible Bankruptcy Laws, a group composed largely of credit card companies, 
lenders and financial institutions that want to make it harder to declare bankruptcy. 
"I worked on the Hill for a while. I had no use for anybody who wouldn't tell 
me who their client was."</p>
<P> Another lobbying powerhouse, the Health Benefits Coalition, which has fought 
Democrats' efforts to regulate managed care, calls itself "one of the largest 
employer-based health care coalitions ever formed," with a membership list including 
major business trade groups and the insurance industry.</p>
<P> Other coalitions, however, shy from public disclosure. Mr. Doggett, a member 
of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, says he became interested in the 
issue because of the number of groups he calls "stealth coalitions" he has seen 
lobbying on provisions of tax law. </p>
<P> The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that analyzes campaign 
and lobbying spending, says that on business tax issues alone it identified 28 
coalitions that paid $5.4 million in 2000 for lobbying and revealed little to 
nothing about their members.</p>
<P> All but 4 of the 28 groups used what were then known as the Big Five accounting 
firms as their lobbyists. Lawrence Noble, the executive director of the policy 
center, said the lack of disclosure took on particular significance in light of 
the recent corporate collapses.</p>
<P> "One of the questions after <org idsrc="NYSE" value="ENRNQ;ENE-J">Enron</org> 
is, How did we get here?" Mr. Noble said. "You're naturally led then to see who 
is behind legislation, who has fought various kinds of legislation. That brings 
you to the lobbying disclosure act and these coalitions, and they become a wall 
that you can't get behind."</p>
<P> Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm recently found guilty of obstruction 
of justice for impeding an investigation into the Enron Corporation, was paid 
more than $250,000 in lobbying fees from 1999 to 2001 by the Coalition for the 
Fair Taxation of Business Transactions, lobbying forms show. The reports say the 
Andersen lobbyists worked on corporate tax shelter provisions and Treasury regulations, 
but they do not say who belonged to the coalition.</p>
<P> "These folks were working to ensure that any legislation did not impact routine 
business tax planning," Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Andersen, said. "They 
were not involved in any way in advocating the preservation of any loopholes or 
tax shelter provisions."</p>
<P> The coalition was made up of Andersen clients, Mr. Dorton said, but he added 
that he could not identify them, in part because employees have been leaving the 
firm.</p>
<P> Until PricewaterhouseCoopers, another accounting giant, sold its tax lobbying 
shop, the office was headed by Kenneth J. Kies, one of Washington's best-known 
tax lobbyists, and represented an array of coalitions with undisclosed clients.</p>
<P> One of the firm's lobbyists for several of the groups was Barbara M. Angus, 
who is now international tax counsel at the Treasury Department. Ms. Angus appeared 
last winter before the Ways and Means Committee, where Mr. Doggett questioned 
her about who were members of the coaltions she lobbied for. She said that she 
could not recall the clients but that she would get back to him.</p>
<P> This week, at Ms. Angus's request, more than four months later, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
wrote to Mr. Doggett that the Section 877 Coalition included four trusts for members 
of the Arison family. </p>
<P> Alcalde & Fay, the other firm representing the coalition, also initially refused 
to identify its members to a reporter. But it later said the client was the Arison 
family office in Florida. Mr. Alcalde said the firm had not provided any more 
information on its lobbying reports because "there's no requirement" to do so.</p>
<P> But Mr. Alcalde said he would always tell a lawmaker whom he was representing. 
Otherwise, he said, "how can you make the case for your issue?"</p>
<P> Mr. Doggett is preparing legislation to require more disclosure from those 
coalitions that are involved in no other activities except lobbying. The bill 
will try to distinguish between genuine membership organizations and shell coalitions 
set up to avoid disclosure, he said.</p>
<P> He is likely to encounter substantial opposition.</p>
<P> When the lobbying law was written, Republicans objected to greater disclosure 
requirements for coalitions, calling it an effort to chill activism by groups 
like the Christian Coalition. Groups across the political spectrum, including 
the American Civil Liberties Union, also objected.</p>
