<p>ACCRA, GHANA -- Six times a day, Anna Owusu balances a tin bucket on her head 
and wends her way through the narrow alleyways of Nima -- a congested, decrepit 
crush of 22,000 people in the middle of Ghana's capital, Accra.</P>
To fetch water for bathing and laundry, the 14-year-old stops at an old well that 
produces a greenish and untreated -- but free -- liquid. Last year, it led to 
an epidemic of cholera and typhoid in her family's district. 
<P>To fetch water for drinking, the girl continues on to the nearby home of a 
relatively wealthy slumdweller who has paid for a connection to the Ghana Water 
Company. A bucket of his clear, clean water costs her about four cents, which 
over the course of a month adds up to a third of her parents' income.</P>

Anna's choice is about more than her family's health versus its financial well-being. 
It represents the most pressing issues facing Africa as the continent moves forward 
from this week's critical summit of G8 leaders and their controversial plan to 
finance new development.</P> 
<P>While the summit failed to come up with any new aid money, the world's wealthiest 
and poorest nations agreed to a framework for African development that relies 
heavily on private-sector involvement. But as Anna's regular trips to the well 
show, this new approach can be as fraught with trouble as the old ways of aid.</P>
<P>In Ghana, the government and foreign-aid donors believe they are already pioneers 
of this new approach.</P>
<P>The country of 18 million people is one of the few peaceful, stable democracies 
in West Africa, and for more than a decade has embraced an open-market economy, 
foreign investment and trade as key weapons in its fight against poverty.</P>
<P>But in the fetid and increasingly crowded alleys of Nima, the supposedly new 
model of African development is seen as something less than a success.</P>
<P>The slum's water shortages are at the centre of a political debate over the 
direction of development in Ghana, a country in which a third of the population 
has no access to safe drinking water.</P>
<P>The government believes it can ensure a more affordable, more convenient water 
supply for the poor by leasing the national water system to an international company. 
But the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/Water/cmep_Water/reports/ghana/articles.cfm?ID=7740" target="_new">National 
Coalition Against Privatisation of Water</a>, a group that is fighting the deal, 
says the opposite will happen: Ghanaians will lose control of their public utility 
and pay vastly more for their water, costing the poor what little access they 
have now.</P>
<P>As with so much in Africa, everyone agrees that Ghana's current water system 
isn't working. The water company loses vast amounts of water to theft and leaks, 
while it struggles to service its equipment, and the water rarely reaches the 
poor in any case.</P>
<P>For families like the Owusus, the result is to pay as much as 10 times more 
for their water than the wealthy do, as they turn to local water sellers and trucks 
run by private &#34;dealers&#34; that visit the slum every day.</P>
<P>&#34;Already, most of my people can't afford the water,&#34; said Elijah Hamidu, 
the district assembly member for Nima. &#34;What will it be like when they privatize 
it?&#34;</P>
<P>The move to involve the private sector began in 1992, under then-president 
Jerry Rawlings. A sometimes heavy-handed ruler who took power in a 1981 coup before 
eventually ushering in an era of democracy and privatization, Mr. Rawlings put 
water on the list of utilities and organizations he wanted removed from government 
control. It was one of the decisions that made him a darling of the World Bank, 
the International Monetary Fund and other major aid donors.</P>
<P>Even when Mr. Rawlings stepped down early last year, and an opposition party 
took power, his proposal lived. &#34;They criticized it when they were the opposition, 
and then they got into power and discovered that the only way to get a loan [from 
the World Bank or IMF] was to agree to do this,&#34; said Stephen Manteaw, spokesman 
for the <a href="http://www.isodec.org.gh/">Integrated Social Development Center</a> 
and a member of the coalition.</P>
<P>The government insists the deal will generate revenue and improve service. 
Peter Harrold, the World Bank's representative in Ghana, also says it is largely 
a local idea -- an important part of the new approach to African development. 
&#34;This is the government's considered view point,&#34; Mr. Harrold said. &#34;They 
have studied all the options, a management contract, lease, concessions, privatization 
-- everyone agrees the current situation is unsatisfactory and can't go on -- 
and the government believes a lease is the preferred option.&#34;</P>
<P>He insisted there was no condition on a World Bank loan requiring private-sector 
involvement. There are, though, conditions for loans and debt relief requiring 
the end of subsidized water prices and the implementation of user fees. Mr. Harrold 
said &#34;we facilitated them [the government] to look at all the options and 
we believe that private production is more efficient than public.&#34;</P>
<P>In fighting the proposed leasing deal, the coalition's primary concern is that 
a private company will have no motivation to build new infrastructure in the places 
where it is most badly needed, especially in slums such as Nima and rural areas 
that currently have no access because the poor are not seen as significant consumers. 
There is much more money to be made delivering water to high-income areas with 
swimming pools and lush lawns.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrold acknowledged this is a serious concern, but said the solution is 
for Ghana's government to require the private provider to guarantee a water supply 
to all areas of the country, and to monitor its supply, as publicly regulated 
utilities do in many other places.</P>
<P>This leads to the second major concern for the coalition: how little of the 
process is public. &#34;Until ISODEC blew the whistle on this, 99 per cent of 
the population didn't know there was any such policy,&#34; Mr. Manteaw said. &#34;In 
Canada, such a major public policy decision would have to have a series of hearings.&#34;</P>
<P>There have been none in Ghana. Not even the bid documents have been made public. 
And no one at the well where Anna goes had heard of the plan.</P>
<P>&#34;What right does the World Bank or the IMF have to demand respect for the 
rule of law and democracy and then to do this?&#34; Mr. Manteaw said. &#34;If 
they wanted this to be public, they could have built the requirement for hearings 
into the conditions.&#34;</P>
<P>Regardless of its merits or flaws, the agreement has yet to be signed, a year 
after it was expected. A deal is now slated by the end of this year, but the controversy 
has already led to a decision to cut the lease to 15 years from 25 years.</P>
<P>The leading contender for the contract, which is believed to be worth $1.4-billion, 
is thought to be Suez Lyonnaise Des Eaux, a French firm that runs water systems 
in 120 countries.</P>
<P>According to ISODEC, which claims to have seen details of the bid document, 
the government will have to double the price of water before the lease comes into 
effect. No company will accept the negative public-relations impact of that themselves, 
the group says, adding that about nine cents per bucket would be the lowest price 
at which a profit could be made.</P>
<P>The coalition also says the bid documents contain no provisions to guarantee 
that any equipment built or improved will remain the property of the water company 
when the 15-year lease ends. Nor is there any plan to train local managers and 
workers.</P>
<P>For Mr. Manteaw, though, the issue boils down to whether development should 
serve private interests first or public needs. Who will get water, he asked, to 
the parched rural areas? Or deep into the alleyways of Nima?</P>
<P>&#34;If there is a problem with our public-sector system, then fix it,&#34; 
he said. &#34;Water is so basic, you can't subject it to the free market.&#34;</P>
