<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->JERUSALEM -- Israeli forces drove deeper into two Palestinian refugee camps Friday, announcing they had recovered scores of bombs, mines 
and other weapons in a massive two-
day anti-terrorism assault that left at 
least 20 Palestinians dead. Two Israeli 
soldiers died. 
<p>
Brig. Gen. Gershon Yitzhak said 
the most costly suicide attacks waged 
against Israelis had originated at the 
Balata and Jenin camps in the West 
Bank, and Israel acted because the 
Palestinian Authority had failed to do 
its job. <p>

A neighbor watching 20 meters away on his balcony told Reuters that an Israeli tank crewman had beckoned a group of children to approach his vehicle, and Mahmoud was then gunned down by four bullets of the tank's machine gun when the party came near. The boy's body remained on the scene until the tank left the area. REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah <br>

</table></font>Criticism of the operation mounted, 
coming from Palestinians and some 
Israelis. For the first time since he 
took office a year ago, Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon's approval rating 
dropped below 50 percent in the 
weekly poll for the Ma'ariv newspaper. A front page editorial in Yediot 
Ahronot lambasted the dangerous 
and high-risk sweep, dubbed "Colorful Journey," saying it would be better named "Casino Sharon" because 
of the operation's uncertain chance of 
success. <p>
The action followed a series of suicide bombings and shootings, and 
came as a Saudi Arabian peace initiative gathered momentum. The Israelis had attacked the camps by air before, but this marked the first time 
they had stormed them. Backed by 
helicopter gunships, tanks and paratroopers, they searched house-to-
house for weapons and fighters, 
knocking down walls and cutting 
electricity. Snipers positioned on 
rooftops provided cover. <p>
At Jenin, Israelis killed at least five 
people Friday and demolished the 
house of the leader of the Al Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigade. The group, a militant wing of Yasser Arafat's Fatah 
movement, has threatened to retaliate 
in Israeli cities if the troops don't 
withdraw. <p>
"Israel is carrying out dangerous 
measures on the ground against the 
Palestinian citizens that could involve the two peoples in a new violent 
cycle," said Husam Khader, a Palestinian Legislative Council member 
and Fatah leader in Nablus. "The big 
loser will be the Israeli citizen ... 
seeking ... security but still not ready 
for the peace." <p>
Khader said that the reason more 
than 30 Al Aqsa activists slipped out 
of the camps before the troops arrived 
was that the Palestinian authority refused to provide them with ammunition. <p>
Balata, outside of Nablus, is the 
largest West Bank refugee camp, with 
about 22,000 residents packed into an 
area less than a third of a mile 
square. Israeli officials say it is a base 
for Al Aqsa. Israel Radio reported 
that soldiers discovered a pipe bomb 
factory there Friday. <p>
Jenin, at the northern edge of the 
West Bank, contains about 12,000 residents, and Israel says many suicide 
bombers and gunmen from the militant Hamas and Islamic Jihad have 
departed from there to launch terror 
attacks. <p>
Among those killed in Friday's 
fighting in Jenin was Haled Jamal 
Nazam, a senior member of Hamas' 
military wing. Palestinians reported 
that a 10-year-old girl was killed 
while standing by a window in her 
home. <p>
In Gaza, a 7-year-old Palestinian 
boy was killed by what Palestinian 
witnesses said was Israeli machine 
gun fire directed toward a Bedouin 
camp in the northern part of the 
strip. <p>
The operation had its supporters. 
An analysis in the Jerusalem Post 
credited the assault for demonstrating the Army's ability to maneuver in 
the crowded, narrow streets of the 
camps, where few authorities -- Israeli or Palestinian -- had dared to 
go. "The ... ostensible message to the 
Palestinians is that there are no sanctuaries, no place is off limits and 
there is no place to hide," Arieh 
O'Sullivan wrote. <p>
Israeli Cabinet Minister Tzachi Hanegbi said the assault on the camps 
would help prevent attacks on Israelis. "This is for the sake of our way of 
life here, in malls, in cities, in 
streets," he told Israel Army Radio. 
"The classic strategy of Israeli military campaigns has been to move the 
fighting into enemy territory." <p>
Palestinians charged that Israel 
had stepped up its aggression, and intended to scuttle the Saudi proposal 
that calls for Arab recognition of Israel, provided Israel withdraws from 
territory won during the 1967 war so 
the Palestinians can build their own 
state. <p>
"By its brutal attacks against the 
Palestinian refugee camps in Nablus 
and Jenin, the Israeli government has 
declared its true intentions," Palestinian Information Minister Yasser 
Abed Rabbo said in a statement. </p>
