<p>Open warfare has broken out between the White House and Capitol Hill over President 
George Bush's most controversial nomination to date to the bench of American high 
courts. 
<P>The nomination of a politically loyal judiciary is the singular way in which 
US Presidents outlive their terms, leaving an imprint on the nation in the form 
of judges who can sit on the bench making law for life - and the Bush White House 
intends Judge Priscilla Owen from Texas to be one such judge. 
<P>Bush has intervened to back Owen, and her campaign is being managed - as they 
all have since her Texas days - by Karl Rove, long-time political organizer for 
the Bush family and now White House chief adviser. 
<P>The Democrat-controlled Senate, however, is fighting her nomination to the 
powerful fifth circuit Appeals Court, the tier beneath the US Supreme Court. 
<P>Senators and a host of organizations petitioning their judiciary committee 
say Owen has used the bench to advance a a zealous right-wing ideology, contesting 
the right to abortion and favoring big oil and energy companies, including the 
disgraced Enron, which has been one of her - and the President's - biggest financial 
backers. 
<P>They are in turn accused by the White House of detonating a 'judicial crisis'. 
<P>The committee's chairman, Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, particularly 
demanded that the White House 'look into' Owen's Enron connection, after being 
passed a report by a research group, Texans for Public Justice, detailing the 
firm's contributions, after which she ruled in their and other donors' interests 
many times. 
<P>In one instance she wrote an opinion overturning another court, exempting Enron 
from paying school taxes. The director of another group, Nan Aron of the Alliance 
for Justice, said: 'Mention her name and people say "Oh, Judge Enron".' 
<P>'I would just say,' said Texans for Public Justice's Craig McDonald, 'that 
as far as those of us who have watched Priscilla Owen, Karl Rove and George W. 
Bush for a lot of years are concerned, this is the one that deserves to be controversial. 
This is not a Texas fight or a fifth circuit fight; this is a struggle to determine 
whether a political operative, Karl Rove, and his crew are going to determine 
the make-up of the federal courts'. 
<P>So far as some senators are concerned, the most controversial rulings Owen 
made in Texas were in about a dozen cases concerning abortion, and a legal obligation 
that minors receive parental consent before terminating a pregnancy. 
<P>Those rulings have made abortion an issue for the first time in the selection 
of a high court judge. Although the right to abortion is enshrined in US law, 
its eventual abolition is one of Rove's dearest causes. He recently addressed 
the Christian Conservative Family Research Council, saying: 'We need to find ways 
to win this war.' 
<P>In the Texas courts, a girl can appeal against the obligation if she can show 
that telling her parents might harm her, as happened in most Texas cases. But 
Owen, dissenting, ruled throughout that the question was not whether telling parents 
would harm the child, but having the abortion at all. 
<P>Minors, she said, should have to demonstrate to the court 'that philosophic, 
social, moral and religious arguments can be brought to bear' on abortions, in 
addition to those enshrined into law, which concern mainly health risks. 
<P>'It was nothing to do with telling parents,' said McDonald, 'she was trying 
to stop these minors from having an abortion, which is something very different.' 
<P>Herein lies a twist to Owen's nomination. One of her cheerleaders on Capitol 
Hill last week was White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. He joined the Texas Supreme 
Court when Bush was state Governor, then was elevated to Washington and tipped 
to be the next judge to take a seat on the bench of the highest court in the land, 
the Supreme Court. 
<P>And yet, when Owen was overruled in trying to stop an abortion in 2000, even 
her colleague on the bench, Gonzales, protested that to follow her lead 'would 
be an unconscionable act of judicial activism'. 
<P>A legal watchdog, People for the American Way, argues that Owen indulges in 
'activist' lawmaking which establishes law rather than interpret it. 'President 
Bush has said he wants judges who will interpret the law, not make it,' said the 
group's director, Ralph Neas. 'In Priscilla Owen, he has found the exact opposite.'
