The UN appeared poised to drop an inquiry into Israel's devastating offensive against the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin after Tel Aviv refused for a fourth time to let a UN mission investigate what happened there.
<p>The Israelis insist they killed 52 people, mostly Palestinian fighters, in pitched battles that also left 23 of their soldiers dead.</p>
<p>But Palestinians say hundreds of civilians were massacred in the nine days of ferocious fighting that occurred after Israeli troops, tanks and helicopters swooped on the camp in the northernmost part of the West Bank on April 3.</p>
<p>A senior UN official said UN Secretary General Kofi Annan was "minded to disband" the team charged with the investigation after Israel rejected it for a fourth time.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israel allowed 26 Palestinians to leave the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where Israeli troops have been trapping 200 Palestinians fighters for the last month.</p>
<p>Plans also progressed to end the Israeli army siege of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli forces started to withdraw from the city of Hebron.</p>
<p>But they simultaneously surrounded a hospital there, where they believed 20 Palestinian militants were holed up.</p>
<p>And violence flared in the Gaza Strip where Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinians, including a two-year-old girl who was killed when an Israeli tank opened fire on her home.</p>
<p>As a group of about 20 UN fact-finders and advisers waited in Geneva, UN under-secretary general for political affairs Kieran Prendergast read out Annan's advice to scrap the Jenin mission to the Security Council.</p>
<p>He said "a thorough, credible and balanced report" into Jenin was impossible without Israel's full cooperation.</p>
<p>"Since it appears from today's cabinet statement by Israel that the difficulties in the way of deployment of the fact-finding team will not be resolved any time soon, the secretary general is minded to disband the team and I have so informed the council," Prendergast told reporters.</p>
<p>Israel's security cabinet voted by 13 votes to one on Tuesday to refuse to allow the team to start work until certain "crucial conditions" were met.</p>
<p>"Israel has presented crucial conditions so that the mission can honestly seek the facts but as long as these conditions are not met it is not possible for the mission to start its work," the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters as he arrived at UN headquarters, Annan said the UN had done everything to meet Israeli concerns about the mission's composition and terms of reference.</p>
<p>He recalled that Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres had told him in a telephone call that Israel had nothing to hide.</p>
<p>"Not just Mr Peres but also the defense minister, (Binyamin) Ben Eliezer, who told me we were welcome, we have nothing to hide," Annan said.</p>
<p>Before the Israeli decision, Communications Minister Reuven Rivlin told army radio the Jewish state would never allow the mission to visit the camp in the northernmost West Bank unless its mandate was redefined.</p>
<p>The Palestinians reacted angrily to the latest turn of events.</p>
<p>"We ask Kofi Annan to send the fact-finding team immediately because there has been an Israeli crime and state terrorism against our people, especially in the Jenin refugee camp," chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told AFP.</p>
<p>"We call on him not to give in to Israeli pressure," he said. "If he doesn't send the team it will be extremely harmful for the United Nations and for international law."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an Israeli army spokesman said half the 26 people released from the Church of the Nativity were members of the Palestinian security force.</p>
<p>Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Rafowicz said there were still between 180 and 200 Palestinians inside the building, including up to 40 "senior terrorists".</p>
<p>"This is not a breakthrough," Rafowicz said, adding that negotiations were continuing to end the four-week-old standoff around one of Christianity's holiest sites. </p>
<p>Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, a close aide to Pope John Paul II, was due to fly to Israel on Wednesday to assist in the negotiations, for what one Catholic Church official called the "last chance" to resolve the standoff.</p>
<p>Rafowicz said the Palestinians released would be taken to an Israeli army base and screened to see if they were on Israel's wanted list. "If there's no problem they will be released," he said.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday US and British officials continued efforts to place six militants holed up in Arafat's Ramallah headquarters in international custody to clear the way for a lifting of Israeli month-long siege of the building.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials and security experts met in Ramallah for a second time to discuss the technical details of the transfer, which could possibly happen overnight, but there was no official word on the timetable.</p>
<p>British security experts visited a jail in the West Bank town of Jericho where the militants were expected to be moved.</p>
<p>The experts arrived after local workers spent the morning painting and cleaning the cells and fitting them out with beds, tables and televisions, according to Palestinian guards.</p>
<p>Under the plan proposed by US President George W. Bush, Israel would free Arafat after the six Palestinians were taken into US or British custody. The White House said on Monday the six were expected to arrive in Jericho "within a day or two".</p>
<p>The deal to end Arafat's imprisonment was hailed as a potential breakthrough in efforts to restart talks on ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the last 19 months.</p>
<p>Colonel Moshe Hager, commander of an Israeli incursion into Hebron that has left 10 Palestinians dead and 18 in custody since Monday, said the army had begun "a reduction of forces ... as part of a planned process of withdrawal".</p>
<p>But he said his troops would remain in the area around the city for "a few weeks".</p>
<p>He said his troops were determined to get their hands on about 20 "terrorists" in Alia hospital, one of the city's two largest medical facilities.</p>
<p>Hager did not elaborate on the army's tactics but rejected the idea of a lengthy siege such as the blockade at the Church of the Nativity.</p>
<p>"We decided that we will not let the situation in the church play out at this hospital," Hager said. "There are no negotiations."</p>
