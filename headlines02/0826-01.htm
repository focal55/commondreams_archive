<p>The real level of world inequality and environmental degradation may be far 
worse than official estimates, according to a leaked document prepared for the 
world's richest countries and seen by the Guardian. 
<P>It includes new estimates that the world lost almost 10% of its forests in 
the past 10 years; that carbon dioxide emissions leading to global warming are 
expected to rise by 33% in rich countries and 100% in the rest of the world in 
the next 18 years; and that more than 30% more fresh water will be needed by 2020. 
<P>The background paper for last month's Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development pre-Johannesburg meeting on sustainable development draws on many 
previously unseen UN, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and academic papers. 
<P>Although the governments of the world's 22 richest nations who make up the 
OECD have seen the document, many of the calculations are new and considerably 
different from their own. 
<P>It calculates that less than 0.1% of of the average income of the 22 members 
of the OECD actually finds its way to the world's low income countries and just 
0.05% went to the least developed countries. Recent US and EU initiatives, it 
says, "will not meet targets at any time soon". 
<P>Donor assistance for environmental protection and basic social services has 
declined to less than 15% of all aid compared with 35% at the time of the last 
earth summit in 1992. 
<P>The OECD paper calculates that rich countries now subsidize their industries 
by up to $1,000m a year, including more than $300bn in agriculture. This, it says, 
is having increasing effects on the development of poor countries. and on environmental 
degradation. If unrestricted market access were given to just the four richest 
economies in the world, it would increase per capita incomes of more than 2 billion 
people in the world's most populated countries by 4% a year. 
<P>Meanwhile, the paper finds that foreign assistance from western European countries, 
including private funding and direct investment encouraged through national policies, 
was more globally oriented in 1900 than it is today. 
<P>It says that if the EU, Canada, Japan and the US allowed migrants to make up 
4% of their workforce, the returns to poor countries could be $160bn to 200bn 
a year - far more than any debt relief could provide. 
<P>The paper's calculations of environmental degradation suggest the many conventions, 
treaties and intergovernmental agreements signed in the past decade have had little 
or no effect on stopping the rush for timber and mineral resources in the developing 
world and that extinction of species is now reaching 11% of birds, 18%-24% of 
mammals, 5% of fish, and 8% of plants. 
<P>Over the next 18 years, says the report, global energy use is expected to expand 
by more than 50%, and by more than 100% in China, east Asia and the former Soviet 
Union. Transport is by then expected to account for more than half of global oil 
demand. 
<P>"The non-renewable fossil fuel resource base is expected to be sufficient to 
meet demand to 2020 though problems beyond that point are foreseen for natural 
gas and possibly oil," the report says. 
<P>It adds that OECD countries subsidize the emission of global warming gases 
by $57bn - almost exactly what the report estimates it would cost to meet international 
targets. The paper suggests that investing the money in reducing climate change 
emissions would have next to no effect on the global economy. "Through the provision 
of subsidies on fossil fuels governments are effectively subsidizing pollution 
and global warming as more than 60% of all subsidies flow to oil, coal and gas." 
<P>Environment and development groups yesterday reacted to the report with horror. 
<P>"The rich world knows this is happening," said the chair of Friends of the 
Earth International, Ricardo Navarrez. "We in poor countries have always known 
the climate is changing, aid does not come, and the poor are getting poorer. The 
richest countries are here in Johannesburg to keep the system going." <BR>
