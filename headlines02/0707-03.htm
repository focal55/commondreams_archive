<p> BOB Freibaum surveyed his loaded tray for a second then opened the styrofoam 
box containing his hamburger. With a salt-frosted rustle he dumped a sleeve of 
French fries into the lid, squirted a pile of tomato ketchup on them and punched 
a straw through the plastic lid of his super-sized chocolate milkshake. Bob was 
ready for lunch. 
<p> With earnest concentration he ploughed his way through his burger, fries and 
shake before throwing a deep-fried apple pie down his throat for good measure. 
He leaned back, a broad grin on his face.

Nowhere is the fast food industry bigger than the United States, and its citizens 
are paying the price for companies&#8217; ruthless marketing, say health campaigners.<br>

</table></font>"Damn, I love a Big Mac!" he said. The Big Mac is not so loving to him. Bob 
acknowledges there is a connection between his love affair with McDonald’s most 
famous product and his near-inability to fit his 18-stone frame behind the table. 
"They reckon these things are bad for you," he said, "but they sure taste good, 
and that’s OK by me." 
<p> Freibaum’s satisfaction is as plain to see as his 46-inch waist but to a growing 
army of lawyers and nutritionists he is little more than a victim of a ruthless 
fast food industry they claim is responsible for America’s growing struggle with 
obesity and its $117bn annual cost to the national economy. 
<p> The charge is that these companies are peddling high-fat, high-sugar food 
and drink without telling their customers it is bad for them. Critics scoff that 
it is ridiculous to hold restaurants accountable for the long-term impact of the 
food they sell, but the same argument was once made about suing tobacco companies 
for the damage inflicted by cigarette smoking. History proved that argument wrong. 
<p> It is no coincidence that leading the charge against companies such as McDonald’s, 
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Burger King is Professor John Banzhaf from George Washington 
University in Washington DC, one of the foremost figures in the legal battles 
that ended with Big Tobacco paying hundreds of millions in reparations to states 
for the cost of smokers’ healthcare. 
<p> Key to victory in the tobacco wars was the contention that cigarette manufacturers 
failed to tell smokers precisely how addictive their products were. Banzhaf claims 
fast food companies are guilty of a similar crime. "I think when a fast food company 
deliberately doesn’t tell you important information that both legally and morally 
they bear some responsibility," he said. "It is deception by omission." 
<p> Bolstering Banzhaf’s position is a recent case in which McDonald’s paid $12m 
damages after being sued by American Hindus who claimed the food chain should 
have advertised that it added beef extract to its French fries. In 1990 McDonald’s 
had proudly claimed it was switching from using beef tallow to fry its chips to 
vegetable oil as part of its commitment to healthy eating. It did not announce 
it was adding the beef extract to replace the lost taste of beef that had attracted 
so many customers. 
<p> Whether that case is a legitimate precedent or not, Banzhaf and the anti-fast 
food campaigners are clearly faced with a more diverse target than that presented 
by tobacco. If a smoker dies of lung cancer, the cause is clear. If an obese person 
dies of a heart attack, the cause is harder to pinpoint. Was it the hamburgers, 
the fries, the chocolate, the doughnuts, the endless soda pop or all of them? 
<p> Kelly Brownell, a psychology professor at Yale University says the tactic 
should be different this time. 
<p> "It’s important for us to look at this from a public health point of view," 
he (sic) said, "where we are not concerned with how overweight an individual is 
but how overweight the population is." 
<p> Brownell believes that means attacking the culture of the fast food industry 
that sees targeting young children in a bid to hook them into fast food, just 
as one tobacco company did by making a cartoon character out of one of its cigarette 
brands. 
<p> "We take Joe Camel off the advertising billboard because it is marketing bad 
products to our children," he said, "but Ronald McDonald is considered cute. How 
different are they in their impact, in what they are trying to get kids to do?" 
<p> Finding a weapon to use in this war is proving harder than finding indignant 
rhetoric. Kelly Brownell once famously advocated a "Twinky Tax", named after a 
gooey American confection filled with sweet cream. It got nowhere. He still believes 
some form of tax on fatty food should be imposed, the revenue being spent on health 
education programs.
<p> Civil libertarians ridicule the idea of taxing food. "We can only imagine 
- different tax brackets for different cholesterol levels," said Brian Cohen of 
America’s Future Foundation. "Itemized tax deductions for healthy food? Extra 
exemptions for dependents who make the soccer team?" 
<p> Congress appears to agree it is a bad idea and has consistently refused to 
take up the cause. John Banzhaf prefers to use the legal system against fast food, 
much as he did in the Tobacco Wars. "There is a movement afoot to do something 
about the obesity problem and see it in terms of costs," Banzhaf said. "It is 
appropriate that the cost shouldn’t be borne by everybody but confined to those 
who use the products and/or produce them." 
<p> He says this means fighting individual battles over misleading advertising 
or misrepresentation of fast food’s fat content. Gradually, he believes, the industry 
would be sufficiently wounded for states to get involved, just as they did against 
the tobacco companies, to recover the cost of caring for sick citizens. He reckons 
that would get the companies’ attention. 
<p> The campaign finds sympathy with the man who has done more than any to document 
the impact of the fast food business on America, Eric Schlosser, whose book "Fast 
Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal" caused an uproar on its publication 
last year. Schlosser agrees that there is a health risk associated with fast food 
but goes one step further, accusing the companies of deliberately marketing to 
poorer Americans, attracted by the flashy advertising campaigns and the cheap, 
plentiful food on offer. 
<p> "They are serving extremely high-fat food to people who are at the greatest 
risk of the health consequences from obesity," he said. "And by heavily marketing 
unhealthy foods to low-income children they are encouraging health problems among 
the segment of the population that can least afford them." 
<p> If there is a link between fast food and obesity, evidence for Schlosser’s 
contention is available throughout the land. It is not easy to spot very fat people 
in prosperous metropolitan areas of America but in poorer rural regions they are 
hard to avoid. 
<p> Schlosser believes the damage wrought by fast food companies on America is 
even deeper than adding inches to the national waistline. His book documents the 
industrialization of the meat industry that geared itself to meet the demand of 
the fast food business and the growing prevalence of deadly bacteria in chicken 
and beef that has resulted from it. He also reports on the appalling employment 
conditions in both the meat and the fast food industries that draw on immigrants, 
often in the US illegally, or non-unionized young people for their staff. His 
most stomach-churning evidence is of appalling hygiene conditions in fast-food 
restaurants that project a gleaming exterior to their customers but harbor filth 
and disease behind the counter. 
<p> What all sides agree on is that the rise in the fast food culture has gone 
hand in hand with growing sloth in America epitomized by an ever-greater reluctance 
to walk anywhere, and a booming entertainment and media industry that keeps Americans’ 
eyes glued to computers, TV and video games and their backsides glued to the couch. 
<p> All they disagree on is whether it is the fault of the companies peddling 
the lifestyle or individual Americans for buying into it. 
<p> "The ultimate ‘villain’ in America’s epidemic of blubber has more to do with 
lifestyle choices than nefarious businesses peddling fattening foods," said conservative 
commentator J D Tucille. "Obesity comes as a trade-off for the pleasure that people 
take in eating and leading sedentary lifestyles. Some of us may not agree with 
that trade-off, but we are free to make other choices."</span></div> </p>
