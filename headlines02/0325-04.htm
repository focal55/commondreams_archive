Kelli Corrigan, 26, has just returned from a year as a <a href="http://www.peacebrigades.org/" target="_new">Peace Brigades International</a> volunteer in Colombia, the most violent country in the Western Hemisphere, if not the entire world.
<p>The Peace Brigades provides what it describes as "non-violent peacekeeping in areas of violent conflict and repression, offering unarmed protective accompani-  ment to individuals, organizations, and communities threatened with violence and human rights abuses."</p>
<p>It is not affiliated with any religious or political institution and takes no position on social, economic or political policies.</p>
<p>More than 3,700 people were killed in "political and extrajudicial" attacks by "non-state agents," according to a recently released U.S. State Department report on Colombia. Most of those "non-state agents" are paramilitaries, which human rights groups have linked to the Colombian military.</p>
<p>"If you are a community organizer or a labor leader or a human rights defender, then you're a target," Corrigan said in an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last week during a Seattle visit at the invitation of a local chapter of Peace Brigades. She later added journalists to that list.</p>
<p>Corrigan got involved with Peace Brigades while a graduate student in Latin American history at Boston University.</p>
<p>"I had just started studying about Colombia, and I realized how devastating the conflict is there," Corrigan said. She went to work in Bogota, Colombia, in March 2001 and just returned three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Currently, Peace Brigades has volunteers protecting human rights activists in Colombia, Indonesia and Mexico. Past projects included the Balkans, Guatemala, Haiti and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>"In the first  10 months of the year, the Public Advocate (of Colombia) recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time," according to a Human Rights Watch report on Colombia for 2001. "Most were linked to paramilitary groups, followed by guerrillas," the report said.</p>
<p>It added that "certain military units and police detachments continued to promote, work with, support, profit from, and tolerate paramilitary groups, treating them as a force allied to and compatible with their own."</p>
<p>On March 16, in Cali, two gunmen on a motorcycle gunned down Catholic Archbishop Isaias Duarte Cancino, a strong supporter of the peace process between the government and the guerrillas (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army).</p>
<p>Duarte's slaying is believed to be connected to the cleric's accusation that local political leaders were linked to drug money. Most of Colombia's violence, however, is blamed on the paramilitaries -- more than 70 percent, according to most sources.</p>
<p>"There are clearly some personal risks involved with working on a PBI team," Peace Brigades says on its Web site. "All PBI members know that, and before going, each potential volunteer needs to contemplate whether it is worth taking these risks. To minimize the risks, PBI has developed strict local safety guidelines, maintains regular contacts with the diplomatic corps, and has created a wide international network of many supporters who will voice their protests if a serious incident occurs."</p>
<p>That support network made Corrigan feel a little more at ease while she was in Colombia.</p>
<p>Peace Brigades can "create an international scandal within a few hours" if one of the volunteers or one of the groups they accompany  is in trouble, she  said.</p>
<p>Still, there have been a couple of serious incidents. In August  1989, a hand grenade was thrown into the Peace Brigades house in Guatemala (nobody was hurt), and three months later, three volun-  teers were stabbed in their arms and chests on their way home from the bus stop.</p>
<p>In 1990 in El Salvador, five volunteers were arrested, and one of them badly beaten, before being released and asked to leave the country. However, Corrigan said, these kinds of incidents have been rare.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration said Friday that it wants $6 million to protect a Colombian oil pipeline that has been a frequent target of guerrillas. This is in addition to a previously announced request of $25 million to help Colombia fight kidnappings, of which there were about 3,000 last year, and $4 million for Colombia's police. Not even mentioned in the most recent request was the $1.3 billion already approved to help the Colombian military battle  drug traffickers.</p>
<p>Despite  the aid, Corrigan said, the violence seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p>"When I went to Bogota a year ago, of the six organizations that we accompany in the capital, only one wanted us to accompany them all the time, but when I left, all six organizations were asking for us to accompany them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>"It was a very sad sign, but also it shows us that those people believe in the effectiveness of what we're doing," Corrigan said.</p>
