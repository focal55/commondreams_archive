<p>WASHINGTON — An American attack on Iraq could profoundly affect the American 
economy, because the United States would have to pay most of the cost and bear 
the brunt of any oil price shock or other market disruptions, government officials, 
diplomats and economists say.</p>
<P> Eleven years ago, the Persian Gulf war, fought to roll back Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait, cost the United States and its allies $60 billion and helped set off 
an economic recession caused in part by a spike in oil prices.</p>
<P> For that war, the allies picked up almost 80 percent of the bill. Today, however, 
as the Bush administration works on plans to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the United 
States is confronting the likelihood that this time around it would have to pick 
up the tab largely by itself, diplomats said.</p>
<P> Unless the economic outlook brightens, the government could well find itself 
spending heavily on the military even as the economy recovers falteringly from 
last year's recession.</p>
<P> Senior administration officials said Mr. Bush and his top advisers had not 
begun to consider the cost of a war because they had yet to decide what kind of 
military operation might be necessary. Whatever choice is made, experts say, the 
costs are likely to be significant and therefore may ultimately influence the 
size, scale and tactics of any military operation.</p>
<P> Already, the federal budget deficit is expanding, meaning that the bill for 
a war would lead either to more red ink or to cutbacks in domestic programs. </p>
<P> If consumer and investor confidence remains fragile, military action could 
have substantial psychological effects on the financial markets, retail spending, 
business investment, travel and other key elements of the economy, officials and 
experts said.</p>
<P> If oil supplies are disrupted, as they were during the 1991 gulf war, and 
prices rise sharply, the economic effects would be felt in the United States and 
around the world.</p>
<P> All of that could present a complicated political problem for President Bush, 
both in the Congressional mid-term elections in November and as he manages a war 
and looks ahead to his re-election campaign in 2004.</p>
<P> "I think a good case can be made that voters will want to understand the case 
for a war or any kind of extended military action better than they do now because 
the economic considerations are considerable," said Kim N. Wallace, a political 
analyst for <org idsrc="NYSE" value="LEH;LEH-C;LEH-D;LEH-E;SPJ">Lehman Brothers</org> 
in Washington. </p>
<P> Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Japan divided the cost of the 1991 war with the United 
States, but today none has offered to assist with financing a new military campaign. 
In fact, each has signaled that it is not eager to be asked, diplomats say. </p>
<P> "Just open a map," said a member of the Kuwaiti royal family in close consultation 
with Washington. "Afghanistan is in turmoil, the Middle East is in flames, and 
you want to open a third front in the region?"</p>
<P> "That would truly turn into a war of civilizations," he added.</p>
<P> If Mr. Bush decides on a large-scale invasion plan for Iraq involving as many 
as 250,000 troops, as some commanders advocate, the country would face a significant 
military mobilization and call-up of reserves as early as this fall to be ready 
for a military campaign early next year. </p>
<P> James R. Schlesinger, a member of the Defense Policy Board that advises the 
Pentagon who held senior cabinet posts in Republican and Democratic administrations, 
said he believed that the president would opt for a significant ground presence 
in Iraq. He said he did not think that fear of economic instability by itself 
would cause the United States to refrain from trying to unseat the Iraqi leader.</p>
<P> "My view is that given all we have said as a leading world power about the 
necessity of regime change in Iraq," Mr. Schlesinger said, "means that our credibility 
would be badly damaged if that regime change did not take place."</p>
<P> The Persian Gulf war cost $61.1 billion, according to the Congressional Research 
Service, of which $48.4 billion was paid by other nations. </p>
<P> The House Budget Committee's Democratic staff said that in 2002 dollars, the 
cost of the war was $79.9 billion, providing a very rough benchmark for what a 
conflict of similar dimensions might cost today.</p>
<P> Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on 
the House Budget Committee and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said 
the United States would come up with whatever money was necessary. But he said 
planning for a war now would have to recognize the nation's deteriorating fiscal 
condition and the need to address other priorities.</p>
<P> "While it's not beyond our means, we can't have it all," Mr. Spratt said. 
"Since there is no surplus in the budget from which the cost could be paid, there 
will be trade-offs, making initiatives like Medicare drug coverage harder to do, 
and there almost certainly will be deeper deficits and more debt."</p>
<P> James A. Placke, a former senior diplomat specializing in the Persian Gulf 
and now a senior associate of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the market 
reaction to any invasion of Iraq was at best uncertain. "Given the marked lack 
of enthusiasm for this venture, I wouldn't think the market reaction would be 
very good," he said.</p>
<P> "When weapons start going off in the Middle East, markets generally go down, 
gold prices go up, and oil prices shoot to the moon," he added, "and I expect 
that this is the short-run pattern that we can reasonably anticipate." </p>
<P> The United States is best prepared among the Western powers to withstand fluctuations 
in oil markets through drawdowns from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which today 
holds about 580 million barrels of oil. But Richard N. Cooper, a Harvard economist 
who headed the Central Intelligence Agency's top analytical body during the 1990's, 
cautioned that "psychological factors come into play" even in the face of prudent 
preparation.</p>
<P> He pointed out that after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990, oil 
prices climbed rapidly from a low of $15 a barrel and peaked at $40 in October 
1990, although it was well known that the United States would release oil from 
the strategic reserve. Prices remained high for more than a year in what many 
experts saw as a tax on worldwide consumers that allowed Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 
to pay down the American and allied bill for the war.</p>
<P> "I am firmly of the school that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait precipitated 
the American recession in 1991," Professor Cooper said, adding that while he generally 
praised the first President Bush's handling of the war, "the one area of fault 
was that they dallied on their commitment to release oil supplies from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve."</p>
<P> Last Nov. 13, a month after the United States began bombing Afghanistan to 
dislodge the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the president's advisers debated whether Iraq 
should be the focus of phase two of the campaign against terrorism. Mr. Bush directed 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to add more than 100 million barrels to the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<P> Since Jan. 1, oil shipments into the reserve have reached record levels, about 
150,000 barrels a day. One oil strategist in London noted that United States government 
acquisitions for the reserve were accounting for more than half of the growth 
in demand for oil this year.</p>
<P> With a capacity of 700 million barrels, the reserve could be used to disperse 
4.2 million barrels of oil a day to jittery markets — more than enough to make 
up for the 1 million barrels a day of Iraqi crude lost because of military operations.</p>
<P> "What I am hearing from Washington," said Adam Sieminski, an oil markets analyst 
for <org idsrc="NYSE" value="DB">Deutsche Bank</org> in London, "is that serious 
consideration is being given to a coordinated Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawdown 
by the United States, Germany and Japan if military action takes place because 
this Bush does not want to make the mistake his father did."</p>
<P> Still, the fear is that Mr. Hussein, who set afire oil fields in Kuwait a 
decade ago, might strike out with chemical, biological or radiological weapons 
at Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer with the largest capacity 
to expand its oil production to stabilize oil supplies.</p>
<P> "Everybody's nightmare is Saudi Arabia," said an Energy Department oil analyst. 
"People are deathly afraid of any military campaign spreading to Saudi Arabia." 
That country contains one half of the spare production capacity in the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p> </p>
