<p>NEW DELHI - 
							After brutal beatings and police detention,
environmental activists have been promised free access to the pesticides 
factory in central Bhopal city which 18 years ago was the scene of 
the world's worst ever industrial disaster.

</table></font>The promise was made by Digvijay Singh, chief minister of central Madhya
Pradesh state who, according to Pryaag Joshi, Greenpeace International 
director for political affairs, also said permission would be given for 
carrying out soil tests and containment work on the site heavily
contaminated with toxic chemicals. 
<p>
   Singh has instructed his officers to drop charges against activists of
the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal (ICJB) who were violently
stopped by police on Nov. 25 from 'containing' some of the hazardous waste
lying abandoned at the plant which was sold by the U.S. trans-national Union
Carbide to the Michigan-based Dow Chemicals in Feb. 2001.  
<p>
   ''We appreciate the gesture of the chief minister and see this as a move
which will help the campaign to nail Dow and obtain justice for the
affected victims and citizens of Bhopal. But we do hope it will be followed
up by real and timely action,'' Joshi said Wednesday.  
<p>
   Greenpeace screened in the capital on Tuesday, footage from the Nov. 25
police action showing activists being clubbed and kicked at the site by
police before being flung into vans and taken away and charged with various
offenses starting with criminal trespass. 
<p>
   ''The police also impounded equipment used for containment by ICJB 
activists, making it impossible for international specialists to pursue 
their peaceful intentions of bringing the world's attention to the ongoing 
crime in Bhopal,'' Joshi said. 
<p>
   The police brutality and the arrests of 56 activists, 13 of them foreign
nationals, reeked of the government's anxiety to protect the interests of
Dow Chemicals rather than that of the hapless victims or the safety of
ordinary people in Bhopal, he said. 
<p>
   On Tuesday, gas-affected victims and supporters led a huge rally through 
the streets of Bhopal and called upon Dow Chemical, the new owners of Union
Carbide to assume liabilities and responsibility for the Dec 3, 1984 Bhopal
disaster. A toxic gas leak from the plant resulted in the deaths of 6,500 
people and the maiming of 500,000 others. 
<p>
   It has been established by scientists that had refrigeration units at
the plant not been shut off as an economy measure to save about 50 dollars
a day, the runaway reaction in its storage tanks full of deadly
methyl-isocyanate 
may never have occurred. 
<p>
   Various Indian governments appear to have colluded with Union Carbide in
thinly disguised cover-up jobs and also in watering down the original suit
filed for 15 billion dollars and which former chairman Warren Andersen had
publicly committed to pay in the aftermath of the tragedy. 
<p>
   After arrogating to itself the right to represent the victims, the
central government filed a weak claim for three billion dollars and finally
collected 470 million dollars in an out-of-court settlement which was never
accepted by several of the organizations working for the victims. 
<p>
   Union Carbide came out of it all relatively unscathed. At a time when 
it had an annual revenue of eight billion dollars it had to cough up just
70 million dollars for the final settlement because more than 200 million
dollars had already been collected as insurance while another 200 million
dollars had been set aside under court instructions. 
<p>
   Andersen, who was briefly arrested in Bhopal on charges of culpable 
homicide, criminal conspiracy and other serious offenses along with several
other Indian company executives, was allowed to fly back to the United
States where he quickly ''disappeared'' ignoring summons to face trial. 
<p>
   In August, Greenpeace traced Andersen to his home in Long Island, New
York and served him a 'citizen's arrest warrant.' Said Joshi: ''The fact
that Greenpeace activists could find Andersen when several intelligence
agencies failed speaks for the seriousness of the U.S. government in
getting him 
to face trial,'' said Joshi.  
<p>
   But the Indian government has not been particularly serious either. 
<p>
In May, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the country's main
sleuthing agency asked the courts in Bhopal for a dilution of charges
against Andersen
to negligence and let him off criminal culpability. 
<p>
   Greenpeace campaigner Von Hernandez said it did appear that India, 
as with other developing countries, was eager not to do anything that might
discourage foreign investors. 
<p>
   ''As far as we know there has been no move on the part of the Indian
government to initiate extradition proceedings against Andersen,'' he said. 
<p>
   Rallies were conducted by the ICJB and its supporters on Tuesday not 
only in Bhopal but also in the western port city of Mumbai where Dow
Chemicals has its country headquarters. 
<p>
   Said Vinod Shetty convener for the group in Mumbai: ''If Dow can accept
Carbide's assets they must accept its liabilities as well and these include
cleaning up the plant site and its surroundings.''
<p>
   Greenpeace, which has carried out soil sampling and other tests on the
site said it is prepared to share technology to help the Madhya Pradesh
government clean up the site from where toxic chemical are said to be
leaching into the ground and contaminating drinking water.
<p>
   ''We have told the chief minister that while Greenpeace does not have
the resources to provide continuous support in financial and other matters, 
we can  give technical and developmental support,'' said Ruth Stringer,
senior scientist at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories in Exeter, U.K.
<p>
   She described the site as one of the most toxic places she had ever seen
with the soil still loaded with chlorinated benzenes, chlorform, carbon
tetrachloride and other chemicals that could penetrate the skin and affect 
the kidneys, liver and the nervous system. 
<p>
   Stringer was part of a team which authored the Greenpeace document
entitled 'The Bhopal Legacy', released three years ago which put the number
of killed 
by the tragedy at ''an estimated 16,000''  and those injured at 500,000.
<p>
   Her colleague Hernandez said Greenpeace was determined to carry on with
its global campaign to get Dow Chemical to accept responsibility.</p>
