<p>Israel has dismissed a United Nations resolution calling for it to end its military operations around Ramallah, where it is besieging Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
<P>
The resolution, passed by the UN Security Council early on Tuesday, also called for Israeli forces to withdraw from all other Palestinian towns.

</table>It came as a new military incursion into Gaza City left nine Palestinians dead.
<P>
But Israeli officials described the resolution as "unbalanced", and appears set to ignore the withdrawal calls.
<P> Foreign ministry spokesman Mark Sofer said what was needed first was an end 
to terror. 
<P> And political sources quoted by Israeli state radio said that military operations, 
including the Ramallah siege, would continue and "gradually intensify" in the 
Gaza Strip specifically. 
<P> The chorus of international criticism directed at Israel has continued to 
grow louder. 
<P> Pope John Paul's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said the pope was worried 
by the "grave situation", and urged an end to the Ramallah siege. 
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon should "suspend such actions that compromise 
the already faint hopes of peace in the region", said Mr Navarro-Valls. 
<P> And President Jacques Chirac of France said he was "dismayed" at the way the 
crisis was developing. 
<P> "I believe these methods will achieve nothing," he said. 
<P> Israel's main ally, the US, failed to follow its usual policy of vetoing or 
voting against Security Council resolutions criticising Israel, choosing instead 
to abstain. 
<P> The BBC's Jim Fish in Jerusalem says Palestinians take heart from what they 
see as a shift in the American position, following its rare criticism on Monday 
of the Ramallah siege. 
<P> The UN resolution has been welcomed by the Palestinian leadership as a "step 
in the right direction". A spokesman said the US abstention was a "clear criticism 
of Israel". 
<P> However, senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said resolutions alone 
were not enough. 
<P> "We need to see such resolutions implemented," he said. 
<P> The resolution, brokered by European states, calls for: 
<P> 
<UL>
<LI>Israel to "immediately cease measures in and around Ramallah, including the 
destruction of Palestinian civilian and security infrastructure" 
<LI>For the "expeditious withdrawal of Israeli occupying forces" from Palestinian 
cities toward positions held prior to September 2000 
<LI> For "the complete cessation of all acts of violence, including all acts of 
terror, provocation, incitement and destruction".
</UL>
<P> The BBC's Greg Barrow says the 14-hour debate, which covered four different 
draft resolutions, reflected the disunity among members. 
<P> Deputy US Ambassador James Cunningham said his country had abstained because 
the resolution failed also to explicitly condemn Palestinian suicide bombings. 
<P><B>'Double standards'</B> 
<P> Our correspondent says that Arab states have raised what they regard as a 
double standards in the Security Council's dealings. 
<P> Israel, they argue, is allowed to flout successive UN resolutions while other 
nations like Iraq are being held to account for their non-compliance. 
<P> Israel justified its incursion into Gaza as a response to recent attacks on 
Jewish settlements. 
<P> Bulldozers backed by tanks advanced into a number of areas of Gaza at midnight, 
meeting heavy resistance, the army said. 
<P> "Explosive devices were targeted at the soldiers. Army forces returned fire 
and hit a number of armed men," the army said, adding that it had suffered no 
casualties of its own. 
<P> The Israelis say they destroyed 13 workshops used for making weapons. 
<P> Gaza hospital staff said nine Palestinians were killed and 24 injured. 
<P> At least two of the dead were identified as members of militant groups - Yassin 
Nasser, 53, of Hamas and 20-year-old Jaber al-Kharazi of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. 
<P> Protesters against the siege of Mr Arafat's compound demonstrated in Ramallah 
on Monday night.
