<p>A group of Americans are seeking political asylum in Canada, claiming they 
face persecution by their own government because of their use of medicinal marijuana. 
<P>Their cases are being considered by the Canadian legal authorities, who are 
assessing whether they face "genuine fear of persecution" if they are sent back. 
<P>Hundreds of Americans have crossed the border into Canada in recent months 
following clampdowns ordered by the attorney general, John Ashcroft, on medicinal 
marijuana clubs that exist in states where voters have passed measures approving 
them. 
<P>They provide marijuana to patients suffering from cancer, Aids, multiple sclerosis 
and glaucoma and whose doctors have suggested the use of the drug. 
<P>This week, the California supreme court ruled that Californians who grow or 
use marijuana for personal medicinal needs are protected from prosecution in state 
courts if they have approval. But the federal government is fiercely opposed to 
this and is continuing its prosecutions in federal courts. 
<P>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recently raided medicinal marijuana 
clubs in LA and San Francisco, a process upheld by the US Supreme court. 
<P>Some who have crossed the border are wanted on marijuana charges in the United 
States and the US authorities are pressuring Canadian law enforcement agencies 
to send them back. The moves come as Canada, like the UK, is liberalizing its 
laws on cannabis. 
<P>One of the best known American fugitives in Canada is Renee Boje, whom the 
US wishes to extradite to stand trial for cultivating cannabis plants at the home 
of Todd McCormick, a cancer patient and medicinal marijuana activist in LA. She 
had watered the plants on his behalf. 
<P>"I'm a member of a class of society they're trying to oppress or wipe out completely," 
Renee Boje told the online news network, AlterNet from her home in Vancouver, 
British Columbia. 
<P>If convicted, she faces a minimum sentence of ten years. The length of that 
sentence is part of her plea that she faces unjust persecution if she were to 
return home. "There are hundreds of Americans here because they are being persecuted 
by their own government." 
<P>Another American, Steve Kubby, the Libertarian Party's 1998 candidate for governor 
of California, and Ken Hayes, who operated the 6th Street Harm Reduction Center 
in San Francisco, have also entered Canada. 
<P>Kubby, who has adrenal cancer, faces a 120-day jail term for drug possession. 
Additional charges, filed since he arrived in Canada, of conspiring to grow more 
than 1,000 plants, mean that he could face a sentence of ten years or more. 
<P>Both men have now formally claimed refugee status under the UN refugee convention 
on the grounds that they have a "well-founded fear of persecution" in the US. 
Canadian immigration officials have allowed them to stay while their status is 
determined in court. 
<P>"US officials have violated the law and intentionally targeted the leaders 
of the medical marijuana movement by using conspiracy charges," said Kubby. "I'm 
being threatened with a death sentence. How can anyone justify that and say it's 
not an attempt to persecute me?" 
<P>Their claims have been attacked by the White House drugs policy adviser Robert 
Maginnis who said on Canadian TV: "Providing sanctuary to some of these people 
who see Canada as an easy place to escape the long leash of US law enforcement 
is dangerous ... I would hope that the Canadian government would see fit to send 
them back to the US so they can face charges." 
<P>The Canadian federal government has granted permits to possess or grow marijuana 
to more than 800 Canadians who suffer from Aids, cancer or multiple sclerosis. 
<P>Many of the American refugees are now growing their own marijuana through such 
medicinal marijuana clubs as the Vancouver-based Compassion Club, which estimates 
that over 100 of its 2,000 clients are Americans. 
<P>Canada became a refuge in the sixties and seventies for people who did not 
want to fight in the Vietnam war, a journey memorialized in the song, My Uncle, 
by the Flying Burrito Brothers, who sang of "heading for the nearest foreign border/ 
Vancouver may be just my kind of town/ 'Cos they don't need the kind of law and 
order/ That tends to keep a good man underground." 
<P>The "war on drugs" is now propelling others towards that same foreign border.</p>
