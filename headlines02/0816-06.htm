<p>UNITED NATIONS - Human rights activists and senior U.N. officials have faulted 
an Indonesian court for imposing a lenient sentence on a former governor of East 
Timor charged with war crimes. 
<p> "The accused (Governor Abilio Soares) was found guilty of the charge (of crimes 
against humanity) and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, which is below the 
statutory minimum of 10 years," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary 
Robinson, said Thursday. 
<p> The sentence was imposed Wednesday by a homegrown war crimes court called 
the Ad Hoc Human Rights Tribunal in Jakarta, whose creation last year had the 
blessings of the U.N. Security Council. 
<p> Soares faced the death penalty for failing to halt the "large-scale, organized 
and coordinated violence" after the Indonesian-held territory voted for independence 
in late 1999. According to some reports, more than 1,000 civilians died during 
rioting after the vote. 
<p> On Thursday, the Tribunal also found that the former regional police commander 
and five other military, police and government officials were not guilty. 
<p> John Miller of the New York-based <a href="http://www.etan.org" target="_new">East 
Timor Action Network</a> said the verdict shows the United Nations and the Security 
Council should have set up an international war crimes tribunal for East Timor 
modeled on those created for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. 
<p> Both tribunals, created by the Security Council, are currently holding trials 
for those accused of genocide and war crimes in the two war-ravaged countries. 
<p> "The verdict by the tribunal in Jakarta shows the process was badly constituted," 
Miller told IPS. 
<p> "The Security Council, in effect, said 'let's give Indonesia a chance'", Miller 
said. "They have been given a chance - and now it's up to the Council to create 
an international tribunal," he said. 
<p> The verdicts were the first arising from a series of human rights trials in 
Jakarta, where more than 18 army officers and civilians are being prosecuted for 
atrocities committed in late 1999. 
<p> The new government in East Timor has also established a body to try allegations 
of serious crimes, including war crimes, but Indonesia has so far refused to co-operate 
with it. 
<p> Miller said an international tribunal for East Timor is needed because the 
newly created International Criminal Court (ICC) can only try those accused of 
genocide and war crimes after it came into force on Jul. 1. 
<p> Robinson said the United Nations is concerned prosecutors in Soares' trial 
did not submit evidence that portrayed the killings and other human rights violations 
as part of a widespread and systematic pattern of violence. 
<p> "Rather, the indictments present the killings and other abuses as a result 
of spontaneous conflict between armed factions within East Timorese society," 
she said. 
<p> "This seriously undermines the strength of the prosecution's case and jeopardizes 
the integrity and credibility of the process," Robinson added. 
<p> She also said the United Nations was concerned that prosecutions to date have 
presented to the court "only a small percentage of the available testimony and 
evidence of victims and eyewitnesses to the 1999 violence". 
<p> Amnesty International also criticized the Tribunal. In a statement, the human 
rights group said the indictments presented in court did not correspond with the 
available evidence. 
<p> Prosecutors "deliberately failed to prove the widespread and systematic nature 
of the violations that occurred in East Timor", it added. 
<p> The judge who delivered the verdict against Soares blamed the United Nations 
for recruiting "pro-independence" staff and election monitors when it conducted 
the vote. 
<p> The judges, the prosecutors and defendants also accused the United Nations 
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) of "irregularities" in the conduct of the vote 
in the territory in September, 1999. 
<p> "These allegations are false," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters 
Thursday. 
<p> Indonesian authorities, not UNAMET, were responsible for security throughout 
the entire consultation process, as set out in agreements signed by the United 
Nations and Indonesia, he said. 
<p> "Further UNAMET was completely unarmed," Eckhard said, in contrast to the 
Indonesian military. 
<p> And an independent Electoral Commission certified the results, after a close 
scrutiny of complaints, he added. "Not one ballot box was unaccounted for." 
<p> Recruitment for UNAMET was open to all qualified East Timorese, regardless 
of their political beliefs. As a result, said Eckhard, it cannot be concluded 
that the violence was a consequence of "any irregularities in the ballot, bias 
or abdication of security responsibility on the part of UNAMET". 
<p> "It should also be recalled that in the violence, U.N. local staff were killed 
because they worked for UNAMET, and U.N. property was systematically looted and 
destroyed."
