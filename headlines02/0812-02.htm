<p>A TOP Democrat has accused President Bush of exploiting the September 11 terrorist 
attacks for political advantage — an accusation that would have been unthinkable 
even a month ago. 
<P>In a clear signal of growing Democratic confidence before the congressional 
elections in November, Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee, said that the President had “cynically made 9/11 the cornerstone of 
the Republican 2002 election strategy”. 
<P>He said that the President had “used September’s tragedy to explain away” the 
growing federal budget deficit and America’s economic problems. 
<P>Mr McAuliffe’s verbal assault on Mr Bush was the most aggressive by any Democrat 
since the attacks. It broke an unofficial accord between the Democrats and the 
Republicans over the Administration’s handling of the September 11 tragedy and 
heralded what is quickly becoming a bitterly contested campaign. The Democrats 
are defending a one-seat majority in the Senate and are hoping to overturn the 
Republicans’ slim majority in the House of Representatives. 
<P>Speaking at the closing session of the Democrats’ summer gathering in Las Vegas, 
Mr McAuliffe made clear that his speech had been sanctioned by Tom Daschle, the 
Senate Majority Leader, and Richard Gephardt, the House Minority Leader, both 
of whom are potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2004. 
<P>Accusing Mr Bush of mismanaging the economy and skewing White House policies 
to help corporate interests, Mr McAuliffe said that the President had squandered 
“an extraordinary opportunity” to take the nation through difficult times. 
<P>His belligerent tone reflected the Democrats’ belief that the President is 
now vulnerable on domestic issues and no longer rendered invincible by his strongest 
electoral suit, the War on Terror. 
<P>“This is a White House that even Republicans call the most political ever,” 
Mr McAuliffe said. “With polling numbers as their only compass and high approval 
rating their only destination, George Bush has squandered our trust.” 
<P>Mr McAuliffe’s Republican counterpart, Marc Racicot, said that his speech was 
“a disservice to our political system”. 
<P>Mr McAuliffe raised no cautions about possible war with Iraq, however, and 
members of the Iraqi opposition emerged yesterday after talks with Dick Cheney, 
the Vice-President, and Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, to say they “have 
no doubts” that the Bush Administration will overthrow President Saddam Hussein. 
<P>Sharif Ali bin Hussein, leader of the Constitutional Monarchy Movement and 
part of the Iraqi National Congress, an umbrella group for Iraqi opposition parties, 
said that Mr Cheney, speaking via a video link from Wyoming, had assured him that 
the Administration was determined to oust Saddam from power. 
<P>“The main message was that the US is totally committed and serious about instituting 
a policy of regime change in Iraq,” Mr Hussein said. 
<P>“There is no decision on how and when, but the US did stress . . . the establishment 
of the democratic rule of law. They would not support replacing one dictator with 
another.” 
<P>The President, who was on a “working vacation” at his Texan ranch in Crawford, 
was more circumspect in his comments on an Iraqi invasion over the weekend. 
<P>He described Iraq as “an enemy until proven otherwise” because of its programs 
to develop weapons of mass destruction. However, he added that he had “no imminent 
war plan” or timetable for confronting Iraq. 
<P>Meanwhile, the House of Saud launched a significant charm offensive in the 
United States after a leaked briefing paper to a Pentagon adviser board described 
Saudi Arabia last week as the “kernel of evil” — a country that funds and directs 
international terrorism at all levels. 
<P>Prince Saud al-Faisal, in an interview with <I>The Washington Post</I> yesterday 
and then in television appearances, dismissed the assertion as ridiculous. “It 
would be the ultimate of contradictions that we finance those who are trying to 
do harm to our country,” he said.</p> </P>
