<p>An estimated 15,000 protesters converged on Boston Common yesterday for a three-hour rally to demonstrate against a possible US war with Iraq. The turnout, estimated by police, rivaled any Boston peace rally since the Gulf War, organizers said.
<P>

   ''I just think it's really a testament to how uneasy the public is with this war that we got this massive a turnout even before the troops invade,'' said Jennifer Horan, an organizer with United for Justice with Peace, a local coalition formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which sponsored the rally.

</table>Toting signs that read, ''Bombing Iraq is Osama-bin-Logic,'' ''No blood for oil,'' and ''Don't be a sheep, resist George's war,'' the protesters crowded around the bandstand where politicians, clergy, and activists spoke to a sea of supporters.
<P>

   ''Your being here today is so important,'' said actor Tim Robbins, who is in Boston filming ''Mystic River.'' ''It took many, many years of our involvement in Vietnam before these kinds of numbers showed up to protest it.''
<P>

   The demonstration attracted longtime peace activists who recalled antiwar rallies during the Vietnam era, as well as young newcomers who took time from their college studies or who pushed their toddlers in strollers across the Common.
<P>

   Some protesters said they oppose war at any cost, but many qualified their objections, focusing on concerns that the United States might act unilaterally, and without the full support of the United Nations.
<P>

   Michael Alaimo, 36, of Beverly, said he worries that if the Bush administration chooses to invade Iraq, the United States will experience retaliatory terrorist attacks.
<P>

   ''I think they're going to really make Americans - if they're not already - pariahs to the rest of the world,'' said Alaimo, a pharmaceutical research scientist, who sipped a coffee to warm himself against the autumn chill.
<P>

   Patricia Garrity, 72, a retired secretary from Duxbury, agreed. She said the threat that Iraq may have weapons of mass destruction doesn't justify using military force.
<P>

   ''I think our way of bombing to find out what they have creates additional hate to the United States,'' said Garrity, who said she has been jailed a dozen times over the years for war protests. 
<P>

   Nick Fuller, 19, a Boston College freshman, carried a large mock-American flag that displayed a white peace sign where the 50 stars would normally be. Fuller, who objects to all war, bought the flag in Washington, D.C., last weekend when he and 15 others traveled in a rented van to take part in a national rally to oppose the war.
<P>

   ''There's this whole issue that if you protest war, you're not patriotic,'' Fuller said. ''Dissent is patriotic.''
<P>

   On the stage, Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate for governor, made the peace sign and praised the crowd as being ''what democracy looks like.'' In a speech, she blamed much of the war threat on the influence held by the oil and defense industries.
<P>

   Away from the throngs of protesters, a handful of people stood outside the Park Street T station holding signs expressing the opposite view.
<P>

   ''We feel we are representing a silent majority of Americans,'' said Sandy Lurye, who along with her husband, Mike, hoisted a sign that read, in part, ''Time is running out. Waiting is suicidal. Peace and freedom don't come free!''
<P>

   ''Most people we've talked to understand the danger,'' said Lurye, who said she was afraid to reveal the town where she lives for fear of retaliation. ''No way do we like war. We are for doing everything possible to disarm Saddam. The last resort is military action.''
<P>

   Several protesters stopped to debate the pair or ask them questions. One man pointed at the couple and shouted, ''These are Israelis!''
<P>

   The Luryes, who are Jewish, are originally from Russia. They came to the United States 15 years ago to escape Communism, Sandy Lurye said.
<P>

   Near the bandstand, the protesters began filing out of Boston Common after about two hours of speeches. They marched through downtown, forming a parade  that stretched nearly a mile and a half, according to event organizers. Chanting ''No way, no war'' on megaphones, thousands walked past the Loews Theaters and the Tremont Boston Hotel.
<P>

   Drumming on empty water coolers, they also chanted: ''1-2-3-4, we don't want your daddy's war,'' and ''Hey Bush, we know you, your father was a killer, too.''
<P>

   With Election Day looming, protesters carried signs supporting candidates, including blue posters for Stein and write-in US Senate candidate Randall Forsberg, a speaker at the rally who is running against US Senator John F. Kerry.
<P>

   ''We're sending him a message,'' said Mary Donahue, 22, of Newton, criticizing Kerry's vote in support of a measure that authorizes the use of force against Iraq.
<P>

   Passersby, who gave thumbs-up in support of the protest, said they were shocked by the size of the march. ''I was surprised to see so many people,'' said Imge Erguvanli, 26, of Quincy. ''If it's widespread, like in the '60s, it could have an effect.''
