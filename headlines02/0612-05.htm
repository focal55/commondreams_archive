<p>Five years ago, Judi Bari lay on her deathbed still saying the FBI had 
framed her as an eco-terrorist. A jury agreed Tuesday and awarded her estate 
$2.9 million.
<P>In one of the biggest civil rights verdicts of its kind, a federal jury 
said FBI agents and Oakland police officers must pay $4.4 million in damages 
to Bari's estate and fellow Earth First organizer Darryl Cherney. The two 
forest activists were injured in a 1990 car bombing in Oakland and 
investigated as eco-terrorists. Bari died of cancer in 1997.

Twelve years after they were arrested in the bombing of their own car, two Earth First! activists were awarded $4.4 million Tuesday in a federal suit claiming they were framed by Oakland police and FBI agents. After 17 days of deliberations, jurors awarded the money to Cherney and the estate of Judi Bari, who died of cancer in 1997. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) <br>

</table></font>The jury unanimously found six federal agents and police officers liable 
for violating the pair's constitutional rights to free speech and protection 
from unlawful searches. They argued that the investigation, which has never 
cleared them as suspects, undermined their credibility and hurt their ability 
to promote forest preservation.
<P>An attorney for the FBI agents said the government, which had fought for 11 
years to keep the case from going to trial, indicated that an appeal is likely.
<P>Attorneys for Cherney and Bari's estate said the  verdict should serve as a 
warning as the FBI seeks broader powers for domestic spying in the wake of the 
Sept. 11 attacks.
<P>"The jury showed the rest of America that even in the face of brutal 
terrorism we cannot discard the very civil liberties that make the country 
great," said attorney J. Tony Serra.
<P>U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ordered the 10-person jury not to talk 
publicly about the case until after appeals are completed. Outside court, six 
of the jurors smiled and nodded as they walked past a group of Earth First 
supporters, who gave them a standing ovation.
<P>Cherney and Bari were injured when a pipe bomb exploded in Bari's Subaru 
station wagon while they were driving along Park Boulevard in Oakland on May 
24, 1990. Bari, who was at the wheel, suffered a crushed pelvis, and Cherney 
received cuts from the blast.
<P>The two, who were on their way to speak at a rally to promote Redwood 
Summer, were arrested within hours, and their homes and vehicles were searched.
<P>Authorities then said they believed that Bari and Cherney were carrying the 
bomb in her car and that it detonated accidentally.
<P>Cherney and Bari later sued investigators, alleging false arrest, illegal 
search, slanderous statements and conspiracy.
<P><b>JURY FINDS CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATED</b>
<P>The verdict followed a five-week trial in Oakland federal court and 18 days 
of deliberations over whether authorities unfairly targeted the activists as 
suspects in the blast. The two were arrested in the bombing but later freed 
for lack of evidence.
<P>The jury found six of seven defendants liable for civil rights violations. 
They are retired FBI agents Frank Doyle, John Reikes, Phil Sena; Oakland 
police Sgt. Robert Chenault; retired Oakland police Sgt. Michael Sitterud; and 
former Oakland Lt. Mike Sims, now with the Tracy Police Department. The jury 
cleared retired agent Stockton Buck.
<P>The trial revealed contradictions between FBI investigators and the 
agency's crime lab over whether the bomb was visible to the car's passengers 
before it detonated. The trial also showed that investigators wrongly stated 
that round-topped nails used in the pipe bomb were the same as flat-headed 
nails used by Bari in her carpentry job.
<P>The officers said they were heavily influenced by FBI agents who came to 
the bombing scene and said Bari and Cherney were tied to domestic terrorism. 
FBI agents, meanwhile, maintain that it was Oakland police who pushed for the 
swift arrests and misrepresented their findings.
<P>Of the $2.9 million in damages for Bari's estate, $1.3 million is punitive 
and $1.6 million compensatory.
<P>The jury said Cherney should receive $650,000 in punitive damages and $850,
000 in compensatory damages.
<P>The trial had been scheduled for Oct. 1 but was postponed because attorneys 
feared the jury would be swayed by favorable feelings toward law enforcement 
after the terrorist attacks.
<P>"The American public needs to understand that the FBI can't be trusted," 
Cherney said. "Ten jurors got a good, hard look at the FBI and they didn't 
like what they saw."
<P><b>FBI MAY APPEAL VERDICT</b>
<P>Joseph Sher, attorney for four FBI agents named as defendants in the case, 
said, "It's too early to talk about appeal." Earlier in court, he signaled 
that the federal government would probably appeal an unfavorable verdict.
<P>Assistant Oakland City Attorney Maria Bee said she was "disappointed" at 
the verdict and the award of $2 million against three Oakland police 
investigators.
<P>"I believe that the verdict is inconsistent with the evidence," Bee said. 
"The Oakland police don't have anything to apologize for. My position remains -
- despite the jury's verdict -- that what they did was reasonable."
<P>Although the judgments are against the agents and officers as individuals, 
government agencies generally cover punitive awards, Bee said. By law, public 
agencies must cover compensatory damages against law enforcement officers who 
act within the scope of their duties.
<P>The verdict is larger than similar decisions and settlements in which 
political activists sued the FBI and local police for civil rights violations, 
according to plaintiff's attorney Robert Bloom.
<P>In 1981, a jury awarded Julius Hobson and several other civil rights 
activists $711,000 for harassment by the FBI and Washington, D.C., police. 
That verdict later was reduced to $46,000.
<P>Bloom noted that other big cases with political overtones settled by the 
FBI often involved loss of life. In 1995, the FBI paid $3.1 million to the 
family of Vicki Weaver, who was killed three years earlier at Ruby Ridge, 
Idaho. The family of of Black Panther Fred Hampton, killed during a FBI raid 
in 1969, received $1.85 million.
<P>To this day, Cherney is angry that he and Bari have never been cleared.
<P>"We lived for years under the cloud of suspicion. . . . We waited a long 
time for the chance to show our innocence," Cherney said. "I think the 
government owes us an apology.
<P>In a videotaped deposition taken just before her death, Bari compared her 
situation with that of an Atlanta security guard who was wrongly accused of a 
bombing during the 1996 Olympics.
<P>"I felt some bitterness when Richard Jewell was given a public exoneration,
" Bari said.
