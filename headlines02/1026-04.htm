<p>Medea Benjamin is not only one of San Francisco's leading activists, she's 
the Zelig of political protest. And with the country inching toward war, the 50-year-old 
Noe Valley resident has never been in so many different scenes.

She made national news for interrupting Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as he 
pitched his war plan to Congress last month. And for getting arrested at President 
Bush's August speech in Stockton. And for her street theater outside Vice President's 
Dick Cheney's appearance that month in San Francisco. 
<P>In her quest to stop a U.S. invasion of Iraq, the former Green Party U.S. Senate 
nominee banged pots and pans in front of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's 
Washington, D.C., home before dawn last month (a "wake-up call"), and spoke Thursday 
at the United Nations press correspondent's club. 
<P>Saturday, Benjamin will speak in Washington, D.C., at what's expected to be 
the nation's largest post-Sept. 11 anti-war demonstration. In San Francisco, the 
same kind of event will begin with an 11 a.m. march starting from Justin Herman 
Plaza and ending with a 1 p.m. rally at Civic Center Plaza. Similar demonstrations 
will be held in other U.S. cities and around the world. 
<P>The San Francisco and Washington events are co-sponsored by the San Francisco 
nonprofit <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/" target="_new">Global Exchange</a>, 
which Benjamin co-founded in 1988. The group is a vocal advocate of peace, justice 
and other social issues. 
<P>For the past 20 years that she has lived in San Francisco, Benjamin has appeared 
seemingly everywhere, like the fictional Zelig of the Woody Allen film, speaking 
out on everything from corporate sweatshops to self-rule in East Timor to California's 
energy crisis. 
<P><b>AUTHOR AND LECTURER</b> 
<P>While the current anti-war movement has her dipping deep into her bottomless 
bag of activist theater tricks, Benjamin is more than just a sidewalk vaudevillian. 
She's the author of eight books, official observer at a dozen international elections 
and, thanks in part to contacts developed during her unsuccessful Senate run two 
years ago, has developed into a popular lecturer. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader 
calls her "a rising player" on the national progressive scene. 
<P>Five feet tall, and no more than a veggie burrito over 100 pounds, she can't 
lift her left arm above her head, the result of having it twisted behind her back 
during the estimated four dozen times she's been escorted off the premises. She 
rarely spends more than a few hours in jail, and San Francisco police Lt. Morris 
Tabak said, "She's always been very professional when we've dealt with her." 
<P>For the past two months, this mother of two -- one is a 12-year-old; the other, 
from a previous marriage, just graduated from college -- has shuttled back and 
forth to Washington, sleeping on friends' couches while she lobbies legislators 
by day and corrals fellow anti-war activists by night. Colleagues and adversaries 
agree she's tireless. The toll: She and her husband spend only two days a month 
together. 
<P>"While you see Medea all of these places, what she's really good at is organizing 
behind the scenes," said Deborah James, who has worked with her at Global Exchange 
for nine years. James wouldn't have been able to help lead the widely-noted interruption 
of Secretary of State Colin Powell at Earth Summit II in South Africa last month, 
"without knowing Medea. I was kind of trying to think what she would do there." 
<P><b>WORLD OF CHANGES</b> 
<P>Yet before she adopted the name "Medea" as a Tufts University freshman, she 
was Susie Benjamin, self-described "nice Jewish girl from Long Island." A high 
school cheerleader who dated the school's top athlete. Benjamin jokes that her 
mother's favorite form of protest was "returning something at Saks that she had 
kept for a year."

Her father, Al, is a well-to-do developer, who says he has "donated hundreds of 
thousands" of dollars to Global Exchange over its 14-year-history. No strings 
attached, say both Al and Medea Benjamin. Al has supported Jewish- related charities; 
Medea supports a Palestinian state. Said the daughter, with a smile, "It's best 
that families don't talk about some things." 
<P>"I admire Susie because she is always true to her own heart," said Al Benjamin; 
only her family still calls her "Susie." "Even when I totally don't agree with 
what she's saying." 
<P>Young Susie Benjamin's first major experience with the big, bad world happened 
when her older sister's GI boyfriend mailed home the ear of a Viet Cong. It jolted 
the 15-year-old Benjamin out of her insulated Long Island life. 
<P>During a trip with friends to Tijuana two years later, she was shocked to see 
young children starving on the street. 
<P>She spent a year at Tufts, and then told her parents she would continue her 
studies abroad. Once overseas, however, she dropped out of school and bolted across 
Europe and Africa. She hitchhiked alone, supporting herself by teaching English, 
picking grapes and doing odd jobs. 
<P>By now, Susie had become Medea. Long fascinated by the Greek tragedies, she 
tried on other names -- "Io" Benjamin didn't ring -- until deciding to reclaim 
"Medea." 
<P>"I just didn't believe the story," she said wryly of the classic tragedy. "What 
woman would kill her kids for a guy? I think she was a strong woman, and some 
people just made up the story to discredit her." 
<P><b>RAPED IN FRANCE</b> 
<P>Overseas, her fearlessness blossomed. When Benjamin was 19, she was raped in 
France by a man who gave her a ride. Yet she continues hitchhiking, spending last 
summer thumbing across Sicily with her college-age daughter. "Once, I got mugged 
two blocks from work (in the Mission District)," she said. "Does that mean I stop 
walking to work?" 
<P>In Africa, she gravitated to refugee camps, trying to save children from starvation. 
She tears up, remembering the 3-year-old boy dying in her arms in Mozambique. 
Blunting the world's inequities that allow some children to starve and others 
to grow up in comfort would become her life work. 
<P>She returned to New York and, after passing undergraduate equivalency tests, 
<P>earned master's degrees in economics and public health. She returned to Africa 
and then went to Cuba with her first husband, who was coach of the national basketball 
team; Benjamin hates sports. 
<P>Yet at first, Cuba's comparative social equality "made it seem like I died 
and went to heaven." Then she bumped into the limitations of free speech while 
working at a Communist-run newspaper; she was deported after daring to write an 
anti-government article. She headed to San Francisco in 1983 for a job with Food 
First/The Institute for Food and Development Policy. She and her husband split 
up shortly afterward. 
<P>By the time she landed in San Francisco, she began thinking about doing something 
that would incorporate her growing number of interests. 
<P><b>UNBOUNDED CURIOSITY</b> 
<P>"Medea likes to say that I radicalized her, but she was already pretty radicalized 
by the time she got (to college)," said Joan Gussow, a professor emeritus of nutrition 
and education at Teachers College Columbia University, where Benjamin earned her 
public health degree. "She was always asking questions, always wanting to know 
how things fit together." 
<P>Benjamin believes all of her pet struggles are related. Whether it's Cambodian 
sweatshops or California energy providers, Benjamin said they're all the fruits 
of wealthy corporations owning mainstream media, holding politicians in a money-girded 
hammerlock, and stocking university boards of regents with their top corporate 
officers. 
<P>The result of this influence, according to Benjamin: The average citizen or 
worker can't be heard over the jangling of corporate coins. So she, often backed 
by Global Exchange's $4.1 million annual budget and international Rolodex, is 
their mouthpiece. 
<P>Her fearlessness has drawn the admiration of political adversaries like former 
South Bay Republican Congressman Tom Campbell, who got to know Benjamin during 
their Senate race. The one where Benjamin's lasting TV image is her being hauled 
away from a debate to which she wasn't invited. 
<P>Even though Campbell disagrees with Benjamin on everything from Iraq to her 
disruption of Rumsfeld's Congressional testimony, he understands her motives. 
<P>"She's very well-informed and researched on all of her issues. I wish her views 
to be heard," said Campbell, who vainly fought for Benjamin to be included in 
his 2000 Senate debate against U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. 
<P>"I wish she didn't have to resort to theater so often. But our system only 
hears people who are of the two major parties." 
<P>Others defend her omnipresence. 
<P><b>SEEN A LOT</b> 
<P>"Would you say that Wal-Mart is in too many locations or that Disney has too 
many characters," said consumer advocate Nader, a former Green Party presidential 
candidate. "She has seen a lot of tragedies around the world. You don't forget 
the stuff that she's seen." 
<P>It was on a trip to Washington, D.C., in the mid-1980s that she met her now- 
husband Kevin Danaher, a tough-talking activist. He asked the then-vegetarian 
out to dinner -- to a steak restaurant. They've been together ever since. 
<P>"While I wanted to save the world one child at a time, Kevin always says, 'Let's 
get the bastards who are doing it to these kids.' " <BR>
<HR>
<b>S.F. PROTEST</b> 
<P>Today's San Francisco protest will begin at 11 a.m. at Justin Herman Plaza 
on the Embarcadero and march to the Civic Center, where a rally will begin at 
1 p.m. 
<P>Parade route: The march will proceed west along Market Street, make a right 
onto Seventh Street, a left onto McAllister Street and enter Civic Center at the 
corner of McAllister and Larkin streets. Scheduled speakers include: U.S. Rep. 
Barbara Lee, D-Oakland; Dolores Huerta, founding member of the United Farm Workers 
of America; and Ron Kovic, Vietnam veteran and author of "Born on the Fourth of 
July."</p>
