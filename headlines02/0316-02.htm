WASHINGTON - The US government has informed Iraqi dissidents this week that it will convene a crucial meeting in Europe in May of up to 400 former Iraqi military officers and opposition figures to chart the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein and the shape of Iraq to follow, US officials and dissident leaders said.
<P>The meeting, being organized by the State Department, represents the highest-profile step yet in US efforts to shape a viable Iraqi opposition from a fractured, contentious movement that has had little success in opposing Hussein. The pace of that diplomacy has increased markedly in recent weeks, as the Bush administration makes clearer its determination. </P>
<P>The meeting will stop short of forming a provisional government or naming an interim leader, Iraqi opposition leaders said on condition of anonymity. It may try to draw up a national covenant on uniting opposition forces and provide the United States a concrete document that can be touted as an alternative to Hussein, they said. </P>
<P>''If they start getting into details, people will start saying we want this, we want that,'' said an opposition official. ''If we keep it general, we won't get down to who gets what share of the pie. That will come later. We don't want to confuse the issue because of human nature, given what it is.''</P>
<P>A former State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said: ''It's not quite to the point where they're setting up a government. On the other hand, I'm expecting it will go much further than getting people together to schmooze.''</P>
<P>State Department officials say the meeting arises from their efforts to recruit the support of former military officers in what is euphemistically called a ''regime change.'' The United States hopes to exploit the officers' connections with the Republican Guard and Iraqi Army that have served as the cornerstone of Hussein's rule and helped him quash popular uprisings after the 1991 Gulf War.</P>
<P>Two generals that have drawn the most interest from the State Department are Najib al-Salhi, a former Republican Guard commander now in Washington, and Nizar Khazraji, a former Iraqi chief of staff in exile in Denmark.</P>
<P>''We've stepped up our contacts, and we've heard some interesting ideas,'' a State Department official said. ''We're trying to figure out how to continue this movement toward putting some teeth into the policy.''</P>
<P>The meeting will draw 300 to 400 people, according to US officials and Iraqi dissidents, and is expected to take place in one of three European sites: Salzburg, Austria; Barcelona; or Gramisch, Germany. It will be held on a yet-to-be-decided date in May, the same month that the United Nations is set to renew the mandate on sanctioning Iraq.</P>
<P>Iraqi dissidents were notified of the meeting by Thomas Krajeski, the deputy director of the State Department's Northern Gulf Affairs desk, who visited London this week. Along with a representative of the US Embassy in London, he held intensive meetings with Iraqi opposition groups and individuals.</P>
<P>Among them were the Iraqi National Congress, an umbrella group that has uneasy relations with the State Department; the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, an Iranian-supported group; and Salhi, who is spending about three weeks in London meeting with other dissidents and British authorities.</P>
<P>A colleague of Salhi's said the former general was expected to brief Pentagon and State Department officials after his return<b> </b>to Washington on March 25.</P>
<P>The former Iraqi general is expected to attend the meeting in May as well. State Department officials have yet to invite Khazraji, who is the subject of an inquiry in Denmark over allegations of war crimes committed under his watch against Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988. He may not be allowed to travel.</P>
<P>''We have not made a decision yet on how to proceed on him,'' the State Department official said. ''But there are few people who can claim to have had his rank, his influence, and his power inside Iraq.''</P>
<P>Across the board, dissidents say they are struck by how much more aggressive US diplomacy in the region has become. One official termed it ''1,000 times more intense'' since President Bush's State of the Union speech, in which he termed Iraq, Iran, and North Korea an ''axis of evil.''</P>
<P>''I feel they are serious and they want to go ahead with this,'' said Hamid al-Bayati, a spokesman for the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq who was in London. ''How they're going to do it and when is still a question.''</P>
<P>US officials acknowledge a debate within the administration over the approach toward Iraq. The Pentagon backs the Iraqi National Congress, while the State Department and CIA have been courting alternatives, like Salhi and Khazraji.</P>
<P>Both the INC and many of the officers are expected to attend the meeting in May, but some INC officials have contended that the State Department's efforts to organize the conference have undercut its standing.</P>
<P>The INC is seeking to organize its own meeting of former officers before the end of April in Washington. </P>
<P>''To tell you the truth, the fact that they're holding separate meetings when all these people are technically under the umbrella of the INC, that in itself undermines the INC. It undermines it publicly and it undermines it politically,'' said Nabeel Musawi, a leader of the INC in London.</P>
<P>State Department officials have made clear their disdain for the INC, saying it is far more effective lobbying in Washington for Iraqi causes than in opposing Hussein. They worry, too, that it draws too little support from institutions like the military and intelligence services that are Hussein's keys to power.</P>
