<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In 
the space of a few minutes yesterday, two starkly contrasting faces of power were 
on view: diplomatic power, clothed in the formulaic rites of the United Nations 
Security Council, and raw, real power as brandished by President George Bush in 
the Rose Garden of the White House.</p> 
<p>For a moment, surveying the placid scene at the Security Council, or reading 
the nuanced legalistic language of Resolution 1441, you could believe the vote 
was the unqualified opinion of 15 like-minded nations, rather than what it really 
was: a document, amended a little to be sure, but conceived and driven through 
by the US to permit Washington to take military action against Saddam Hussein 
should it unilaterally decide to do so.</p>
<p>The resolution speaks of "serious consequences". Mr Bush was far more blunt. 
The Iraqi leader had to extend "prompt and unconditional" co-operation with the 
weapons inspectors, or he would face not merely "serious" but "the severest" consequences.</p>
<p>The doubters on the Security Council may take solace in the absence of "automaticity" 
of any military attack should President Saddam disobey. But Mr Bush put that assertion 
in context. Nothing would impede America's freedom of action. Nor will the President 
tolerate nit-picking when the council discusses future obstruction by Iraq. There 
could be no "unproductive debates over whether specific instances of non-compliance 
are serious. Any Iraqi non-compliance is serious".</p>
<p>Yesterday capped a fantastic week for Mr Bush, a Republican election sweep 
followed by his most important diplomatic victory. The President without a mandate 
has been transformed into one of unquestioned dominance.</p>
<p>Yesterday's UN vote, like analogous ones in Congress before it last month, 
underline how much the world's diplomatic landscape has changed in the 12 years 
since Saddam Hussein challenged the United Nations by invading Kuwait.</p>
<p>The cause then would seem far more clear cut than today; the reversal of an 
invasion of a neighbor, flouting every international law, compared to a preventive 
strike of dubious legality to forestall a threat which many people believe does 
not exist. But in 1990, Russia and China abstained, and Yemen and Cuba voted against 
force to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This time, the Security Council voted 
unanimously. In 1990 President Bush's father only narrowly prevailed in his war 
powers vote in the Senate, but Congress this time gave its approval by three to 
one.</p>
<p>There are three reasons. A new post-11 September urgency in dealing with a 
perceived terrorist threat; a greater readiness of the US to use its military 
might after quick, low-casualty wars in the Gulf, Kosovo and Afghanistan, but, 
first and foremost, the overwhelming power of America in a world whose best interests 
it believes it represents. Those who oppose America, do so at their peril.</p>
<p>The scene at the White House brought to mind the maxim of Al Capone, a figure 
who Mr Bush's foes abroad might liken him to: "You can go a long way with a smile. 
You can go a lot further with a smile and a gun." Except that at in the Rose Garden 
yesterday, while the gun was sticking out of the holster, there was no smile.</p>
<p>The US military build-up continues in the Gulf. "The full disarmament of weapons 
of mass destruction by Iraq will occur," Mr Bush flatly stated. Who is to disbelieve 
him?</p> </p>
