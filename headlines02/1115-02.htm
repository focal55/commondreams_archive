</table></font>Tom and Julie Mahedy celebrated 
their ninth wedding anniversary late last month in the visitors' lounge at the 
Federal Correctional Institute at Fort Dix, N.J.</p> 
<p>"We split a bag of microwave popcorn," laughed Julie, who is raising the couple's two daughters while her husband serves the remainder of his three-month sentence for trespassing onto Fort Benning last November.</p>
<p>"It was emotionally overwhelming... at first," she said. "I'd see all these parents and wives and children waiting to visit with their loved ones, and all I could think of was that they were caught in a trap. But Tom reassures me that, for him, the months have been like a walk in the park."</p>
<p>It was a walk onto federal property that got Tom, and 35 other men and women, into trouble. They "walked" onto Fort Benning property during last year's SOA Watch- sponsored protest of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.</p>
<p>"That was something neither Tom nor I regret," said Julie, who will be attending this year's protest along with Shannon, 7, and Casey, 5.</p>
<p>While Julie won't risk arrest at this weekend's protest outside the main gate of Fort Benning, there's a good chance she'll be asked to speak to the crowd sometime Sunday.</p>
<p>"I'd be happy to share my story on the stage as long as I get a chance to meet the Indigo Girls," she said. "I'm a huge fan."</p>
<p>The nationally known Indigo Girls are expected to perform on Sunday.</p>
<p>Some may question why Julie would want to bring her children so many miles, simply to have them stand in the cold watching protesters do their thing.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sure of that," she said. "I know the majority of people in Columbus don't understand what motivates us to do what we do. I want my children to see that there are thousands of people who believe in the same things we do. It is a cause worth going to jail for."</p>
<p>This won't be Julie's first visit to Columbus. She and the children came here last summer to attend Tom's trial. It was there that Judge G. Mallon Faircloth allowed Tom to address the court for almost an hour. Later, Faircloth sentenced him to serve time in federal prison.</p>
<p>Last year was Tom's first participation in what has become an annual protest of what used to be called the School of the Americas before its name change to the institute. But not his first visit here.</p>
<p>The New Jersey native had attended Auburn University from 1980-82 and later taught for a year at St. Joseph School in Holy Trinity, Ala. His wife and children will be staying at Holy Trinity this weekend, while not camped out with an estimated 7,500-10,000 protesters along Benning Road.</p>
<p>"I found the area beautiful and the people very friendly when we were down there for the trial," Julie said. "I had the feeling that there are some people in Columbus who actually support what we're doing. I just hope that those who don't will at least respect our right to protest."</p>
<p>Just before Tom Mahedy entered prison in September, Julie threw him a 40th birthday party.</p>
<p>"We called it 'an over-the-hill and up-the-river' party," she said, allowing herself a small laugh. "It's certainly a serious topic, but Tom wanted a little levity, too."</p>
<p>Neither Mahedy is a "professional" protester. In fact, Julie is a flight attendant while Tom and his brother have a moving company business in their hometown of Wall Township, N.J.</p>
<p>The family has received plenty of support since Tom entered prison. "Tom gets between seven and 10 letters a day; I get several letters myself. It's amazing how many people are praying for us and all the other prisoners of conscience."</p>
<p>Tom is expected to be released on Dec. 10. A "welcome home" celebration is 
already in the works.</p>
