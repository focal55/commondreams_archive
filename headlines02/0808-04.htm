<p>Saudi Arabia announced yesterday it would veto the use of any of its territory 
for an attack on Iraq. The announcement is a severe blow to attempts by the United 
States and Britain to forge an international coalition against Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The public opposition by the Saudis, traditionally seen as the West's staunchest 
Arab ally in the region, is the latest rebuff for George Bush and Tony Blair who 
have found themselves increasingly isolated by European and Middle Eastern states, 
as well as Russia and China.</p>
<p>The German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr&ouml;der also issued his strongest warning 
so far against an invasion of Iraq, saying it could "destroy the international 
alliance against terrorism".</p>
<p>Because of the Saudi reticence, the United States is now planning to use Qatar 
as its headquarters for the air campaign in any coming war. Work has been secretly 
under way for months to build up an air base there in case the Saudis refused 
permission, as they have.</p>
<p>The Al Udeid base, 20 miles from the Qatari capital, Doha, is now said to be 
almost ready, and squadrons of American and British warplanes are expected to 
arrive in the near future, according to defense sources.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was the launchpad for Western forces in the Gulf War and played 
a crucial role in later actions against Iraq. The Prince Sultan air base is still 
used by American and British warplanes to patrol the southern "no-fly zone". But 
political and religious tension in the kingdom is now high amid a growing anti-Western 
feeling, fueled by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are also protests at 
the continuing presence of large groups of American forces in the land of Islam's 
holiest shrines.</p>
<p>Against that volatile backdrop, the kingdom also faces the likelihood of a 
power struggle within the House of Saud between conservatives and reformers because 
King Fahd is seriously ill in Geneva and may die.</p>
<p>The timing and the forthright nature of the statement, by Prince Saud al-Faisal, 
the Foreign Minister, is seen as highly significant. He said: "We are against 
any attack on Iraq because we believe it is not needed, especially now Iraq is 
moving to implement United Nations resolutions. For the government of Iraq, the 
leadership of Iraq, any change that happens there has to come from the Iraqi people."</p>
<p>Relations between the Saudis and Americans are at a low ebb. Colin Powell, 
the US Secretary of State, rang Prince Saud yesterday in a fence-mending exercise 
after it was revealed that a confidential Pentagon briefing had described Saudi 
Arabia as a funder of international terrorism, and the "kernel of evil and the 
most dangerous opponent" America faces in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Bush administration meanwhile sent out conflicting messages. President 
Bush said he would be "patient" and consult Congress and the US's allies over 
Iraq, but Vice-President Dick Cheney stuck to the administration's hawkish stance 
by expressing skepticism about the value of the UN inspectors' return. Presidential 
aides later said it was not Mr Bush's intention to send a conciliatory message 
by promising to explore "all options and all tools at my disposal: diplomacy, 
international pressure, perhaps the military". US oil futures dipped because his 
remarks were taken as a sign that an offensive was some time away.</p>
<p>The confusion was echoed across the Atlantic, when Mike O'Brien, a Foreign 
Office minister, said war would be averted if Saddam Hussein readmitted arms inspectors. 
But that was at odds with Tony Blair who supports Mr Bush's policy of "regime 
change" in Baghdad.</p>
<p>If military action does begin, the Al Udeid base will play an important role. 
Defense sources say it has a 12,500ft runway, with hangars fortified against chemical 
and biological attacks, for up to 120 warplanes. The base has also been supplied 
with satellite links that enable the command center to co-ordinate air strikes 
and download reconnaissance footage from unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>The US is expected to deploy F-16 and F-15E fighter bombers at the base, as 
well as unmanned Predators and Global Hawks. The British contribution is likely 
to consist of RAF Tornado strike aircraft, TriStar and VC-10s to provide air-to-air 
refueling, and AWACS, Nimrods and Canberras for reconnaissance. The Americans 
also have four warehouses with tanks and armour to equip a mechanized brigade 
at Al Udeid.</p>
<p>President Saddam is due to address his nation in a televised speech today as 
his government steps up efforts to avert a war.</p>
