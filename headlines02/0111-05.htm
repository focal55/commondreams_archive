            Human rights groups are expressing concern about the treatment being 
            accorded Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners who are being transported 
            from Afghanistan to a United States naval base in Guantanamo Bay, 
            Cuba. 
            <p> Twenty prisoners--photographed with hoods over their heads and 
              shackles on their arms and feet--were flown from a U.S. Marine Corps 
              base in southern Afghanistan Thursday via a C-17 transport plane, 
              the first of hundreds of prisoners expected to make the trip over 
              coming days and weeks.

</table></font>U.S. military forces currently have 371 suspected Taliban and 
              al-Qaeda soldiers in custody, although the Guantanamo base is being 
              readied to house as many as 2,000 prisoners, some of whom may be 
              subject to prosecution by specially created military tribunals.
            <p> In a statement released Thursday, Amnesty International said statements 
              by senior U.S. military officials about plans for drugging, holding, 
              and shackling the prisoners during the flights were "worrying."
            <p> If such restraints were necessary, the London-based group said, 
              "they must be applied humanely and with adequate opportunity for 
              the prisoner to move limbs, use the bathroom and eat and drink."
            <p> "Furthermore, sedating prisoners for other than medical purposes 
              would be in breach of international standards," warned Amnesty, 
              a point echoed by Kenneth Roth, the executive director of New York-based 
              Human Rights Watch after Pentagon officials ordered several news 
              organizations not to transmit pictures of the hooded detainees boarding 
              planes.
            <p> "We are particularly concerned about reports that the prisoners 
              may have been drugged," Roth told the British Broadcasting Corporation 
              (BBC).
            <p> According to Principle 5 of the United Nations Principles of Medical 
              Ethics, sedative drugs should be administered only if there is a 
              medical necessity.
            <p> Pentagon officials confirmed plans to shackle prisoners at all 
              times during the trip and that hooding was used routinely when prisoners 
              were taken on short distances. They did not say if the prisoners 
              would remain hooded during the flight or if they were also sedated.
            <p> Speaking anonymously, officials quoted in the <i>Washington Post</i> 
              Friday said a 40-strong contingent of military guards were on hand 
              equipped with stun guns and authorized to sedate prisoners, if necessary.
            <p> Officials also assured reporters both in Afghanistan and Washington 
              that the "detainees" were being "treated humanely in accordance 
              with the Geneva Convention" despite the fact that the Pentagon does 
              not consider them "prisoners of war."
            <p> They also said that media workers had been asked not to transmit 
              pictures of the boarding process precisely because such images may 
              violate the dignity of the prisoners under international conventions.
            <p> Amnesty's latest statement follows a letter it sent to U.S. Defense 
              Secretary Donald Rumsfeld Monday in which it expressed specific 
              concerns about recent photographs of hooded prisoners which have 
              appeared in the media.
            <p> "Amnesty International considers that the hooding of suspects 
              in detention generally may constitute cruel treatment," wrote Amnesty's 
              secretary-general Irene Khan, citing recent rulings by the UN Committee 
              Against Torture in cases concerning Turkey and Israel that the hooding 
              or blindfolding of suspects during interrogation violated the UN 
              Convention against Torture and the Geneva Conventions.
            <p> She also noted that keeping prisoners hooded prevents them from 
              identifying guards who may commit abuses.
            <p> Once they have arrived at the Guantanamo base, according to the 
              Pentagon, they will be held in 6-by-8-foot cages made of concrete 
              and chain-link fencing.
            <p> Officials said they will be subject to more intensive interrogation 
              and possible removal or repatriation to other countries. Some of 
              the prisoners may also be tried by military tribunals whose creation 
              has been authorized by President George W. Bush.
            <p> The proposed tribunals have been attacked by human and civil rights 
              groups that claim they lack elementary due-process safeguards, including 
              the right to appeal their conviction or to challenge the lawfulness 
              of their detention before an independent court.
            <p> The prisoners are sent to the Guantanamo base in part because 
              it is not on U.S. territory which would automatically provide detainees 
              with certain basic constitutional rights. At the same time, base 
              operations at Guantanamo Bay are not affected by an agreement with 
              the host government that also might provide detainees with more 
              rights.
