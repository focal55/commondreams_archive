<p>LONDON - The <a href="http://www.cnduk.org/welcome.htm" target="_new">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> (CND) has filed a
case in the High Court in London to stop the British government from going
to war
with Iraq.
<p>
   A petition filed by the CND is due to be argued in court on Monday
December 9. The court will decide then whether this unprecedented action is
justifiable.
<p>
   The case for the CND is being prepared by the Matrix chamber of
barristers
of which Cherie Blair, wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, is a member. A CND
spokesman told IPS Wednesday, however, that Cherie Blair is not personally
involved in the case.
<p>
   The case rests on the text of the United Nations Resolution 1441. The CND
argues that it
is normal to use the expression "any necessary means" to denote sanction of
military action. "No such expression appears in the resolution," Tony Myers,
campaigns officer with CND told IPS Wednesday. "We are arguing that military
action would be unlawful without going back to the UN and seeking express
approval for it."
<p>
   Myers acknowledged that "there is no precedent for a small organization
going to court to stop a government going to war." But he said the CND is
hopeful that the court will admit the case at the preliminary hearing on
Monday.
<p>
   A petition has been filed in the High Court against Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon. The
CND case will be argued by Rabinder Singh and Charlotte Kilroy of Matrix,
and
Michael Fordham of Blackstone Chambers.
<p>
   The hearing will take place the day after December 8, which is the date
for Iraq to comply with the requirement to list all the sites and programs
relevant to weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
   "If war on Iraq is unleashed, 500,000 could die," says Carol Naughton,
chair of CND. "We face the real possibility of a first use of a nuclear
weapon, which could be British, American or Israeli. We are acting on behalf
of all the citizens of the world who want to stop war on Iraq."
<p>
   The CND campaign is being supported by several MPs.
<p>
   The petition filed in the court says: "Security Council Resolution 1441
does not authorize the use of force by member states of the UN. The UK would
be in breach of international law if it were to use force against Iraq in
reliance on Resolution 1441 without a further Security Council Resolution."
<p>
   The petition points out that the UN Security Council resolution offers
Iraq a "final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations". The
petition points out that paragraphs 4, 11 and 12 of Resolution 1441 deal
with
the event of non-compliance by Iraq with the terms of the resolution.
<p>
   The petition points out that the resolution says noncompliance"shall
constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations and will be
reported to the Council for assessment." The resolution therefore fully
respects the competence of the Security Council in the maintenance of
international peace and security, in conformity with the Charter of the
United Nations, the petition says.
<p>
   "But despite these clear statements on the meaning of SCR 1441, several
ministers of the UK government and United States officials have indicated
that, in the
event of noncompliance with SCR 1441 by Iraq, the UK and the U.S. would be
entitled to take military action against Iraq even without a further
Security
Council resolution," the petition says.
<p>
   The petition argues that the use of force by Britain against Iraq would
not be justified under international law unless: (a) Iraq mounted a direct
attack on the United Kingdom or one of its allies and that ally requested
the
United Kingdom's assistance; or (b) an attack by Iraq on the United Kingdom
or one of its allies was imminent and could be averted in no way other than
by the use of force; or (c) the United Nations Security Council authorized
the use of force in clear terms.
<p>
   The petition says: "It would be extraordinary if, having failed to obtain
an express authorization for the use of force, having incorporated minute
changes to the final draft whose sole purpose was to exclude the possibility
of 'automaticity' and 'hidden triggers'  and to preserve the role of the
Security Council, and having publicly agreed in their explanation of the
vote
for adoption of SCR 1441 that there was no such implied authorization for
force, the UK and the U.S. were to be able to use SCR 1441 as authority for
the use of force without a further Security Council Resolution."
<p>
   The petition adds: "In our view the implied authorization arguments put
forward by the UK and the U.S. Would undermine the control exercised by the
Security Council which is an essential feature of lawful delegation under
the
Chapter VII. These arguments would effectively allow member states to take
unilateral decisions on the interpretation of resolutions, reading into them
authorization to take action which does not appear clearly on the face of
the
resolution."
<p>
   Government solicitor Diana Babar said in reply to the petition that it
seeks an assurance from the British government that it will not attack Iraq
without a further resolution from the UN Security Council, but that "there
is
no legal obligation upon the proposed defendants to provide any such
assurance, and they do not consider it appropriate to provide such an
assurance."
<p>
   The government solicitor said in reply: "There is no legal obligation
upon
the proposed defendants to engage in a debate about legal analysis...and
they
decline to do so."  The statement added: "There are a number of legal
reasons
why any attempt by your client to claim relief in the courts in relation to
these matters should not succeed, and would be strongly resisted by my
clients."
<p>
   The government solicitor said "the matter is non-justifiable and the
courts will not intervene to dictate the conduct of foreign policy,
especially, we would add, in a matter of high policy relating to a decision
as to whether and when the United Kingdom would engage in military action
against another state." </p>
