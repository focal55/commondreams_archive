<p>Only 30,000 people out of almost 30 million now living with the death sentence of HIV/Aids in sub-Saharan Africa are being given the drugs that keep infected men and women alive, well and working in Britain, in spite of the promises of help from rich nations over the past two years.
<P>As a devastating report from UNAIDS on the scale of the epidemic and its human 
and economic cost was published yesterday, it became clear that a vast gulf still 
exists between those who will die in the absence of treatment and those whose 
lives can be indefinitely prolonged by modern medicine.</P>
<P>Last year 2.2 million people died of Aids in Africa. In rich countries, where 
500,000 people are on anti-retroviral drugs, 25,000 died. "It is an enormous scandal," 
said Peter Piot, director general of UNAIDS, the joint UN program on HIV/Aids.</P>
<P>According to the World Health Organization, 230,000 people in developing countries 
are on anti-retroviral drugs to keep HIV in check. But half of those are in Latin 
America - mostly in Brazil, which has used aggressive tactics against the pharmaceutical 
companies to obtain the drugs cheaply, or has manufactured its own copies.</P>
<P>"However you look at it, it is a tiny number on treatment," said Mohga Smith, health policy adviser at Oxfam. "We're saying let's get serious and get our act together and get treatment to people urgently."</P>
<P>The UN report warns that the epidemic has hardly begun, and offers shocking 
evidence of rising infection and death. "Contrary to expectations, there is no 
sign that it is leveling off," Dr Piot said.</P>
<P>The latest count in the report suggests 40 million people are living with HIV. Within the next 20 years 70 million people will die unless drastic action is taken.</P>
<P>In Botswana almost 40% of adults are HIV positive. Among pregnant women HIV prevalence has risen from 38.5% in 1997 to 44.9% in 2001. Among 25- to 29-year-old pregnant women, 55.6% have HIV.</P>
<P>It is a story repeated elsewhere in Africa, and the report also reveals steep rises in HIV infections in central Asia and eastern Europe. Diagnoses of HIV infection have been doubling every year in the Russian federation since 1998, and 83,000 new cases were reported last year. The real figure is expected to be four times as high.</P>
<P>A separate report from UNAIDS last week warned that HIV prevalence in China 
could rise from 1.5 million to 10 million by 2010 if more prevention and education 
efforts are not made.</P>
<P>Dr Piot said promising developments included the engagement of African political leaders and an increase in funding from the paltry $800m (&#163;523m) the west gave in 1999. But he added: "I think the rest is all pretty bad news."</P>
<P>Britain is far from immune from the epidemic, which is not only spreading faster 
than many feared but has the capacity to change its direction. Angus Nicoll, director 
of the communicable disease surveillance center at Britain's public health laboratory 
service, said there were an estimated 33,500 people with HIV in Britain, of whom 
around 9,400 are undiagnosed. What was once largely confined to the homosexual 
community is now spreading faster within the heterosexual population.</P>
<P>"There is no sign that the problem is diminishing -in fact, the truth is completely the opposite," Dr Nicoll said.</P>
<P>"There is strong evidence that unsafe sex is on the increase, with the latest national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles showing an increase in numbers of sexual partners, lower age at first sexual intercourse, increasing levels of heterosexual anal sex and payment for sex. All of these are known to be associated with HIV transmission."</P>
<P>If there is complacency in Britain and other rich countries it has come largely from the knowledge that Aids is no longer a death sentence in the west, because of the availability of drug treatments. But in poor countries, HIV leads inexorably to Aids, destroying families and creating 14 million orphans so far, the report says.</P>
<P>The court victory of the South African government over drug companies two years ago raised hopes that poor countries would be able to buy quantities of cheap drugs. But, says M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res, the prices are still too high. At the international Aids conference in Barcelona next week, it will be calling for the price of a three-drug cocktail - already down from $1,500 a year to about $300 - to fall to $50.</P>
<P>In the wake of the South African court case, UNAIDS set up a scheme to supply 
discounted drugs to African countries. Yesterday's report reveals that the scheme 
has so far enabled only 22,000 extra people in 11 countries to get drugs. Critics 
say the discount prices are too high and are only available for a limited selection 
of drugs.</p> </P>
