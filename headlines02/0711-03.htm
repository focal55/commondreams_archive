<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LONDON, 
July 10 — Britain, which has one of the highest rates of cannabis use in Europe, 
said today that it was relaxing its laws on marijuana smoking, keeping the practice 
theoretically illegal but making private use in discreet amounts no longer subject 
to arrest.</p> 
<P> The decision, announced by Home Secretary David Blunkett in the House of Commons, 
stirred criticism from the Conservative opposition and some Labor politicians 
and prompted the country's former antidrug chief to resign as a government adviser 
because, he said, Britain is "moving further toward decriminalization than any 
other country in the world."</p>
<P> Mr. Blunkett tempered his announcement, which takes effect next July and puts 
cannabis on a par with antidepressants and steroids, by saying he would also raise 
the punishment for marijuana dealing and step up drug education and treatment 
for abusers.</p>
<P> An estimated five million people in Britain regularly use marijuana, and government 
data show that its use has risen sharply in the last 20 years. </p>
<P> A study published last year on drug habits in the European Union showed that 
20 to 25 percent of adults in Britain used marijuana — about the same rate as 
shown for Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain.</p>
<P> The government action followed recommendations of a parliamentary committee 
in May, which said a new attitude of tolerance would give drug policy greater 
credibility among young people and help the police direct resources toward heroin 
and cocaine. Britain has the most drug-related deaths of any country in the European 
Union, with heroin cited as the principal cause.</p>
<P> The parliamentary committee also suggested reclassifying the drug Ecstasy, 
but Mr. Blunkett said he had rejected that advice.</p>
<P> Several other European countries have already relaxed their drug laws. The 
Netherlands has legalized marijuana, while Luxembourg has ended jail sentences 
for marijuana possession. Spain and Italy do not jail people caught with drugs 
meant for personal use. Last year Portugal eliminated jail time for possession 
of small amounts of any illegal drug.</p>
<P> Under the British reform, possession of marijuana would no longer be considered 
an arrestable offense. Though that will not take effect for a year, from now on 
any police action will be limited to issuing a warning and seizing the drug.</p>
<P> Mr. Blunkett countered suggestions that Britain was going "soft on drugs" 
by saying the police would retain the right to arrest users in cases like smoking 
outside schools or in the presence of children. The Home Office emphasized that 
any marijuana cafes where the drug was sold and used openly remained illegal and 
would be closed.</p>
<P> "It is critical that police can maintain public order," Mr. Blunkett said. 
"Where cannabis possession is linked to aggravated behavior that threatens public 
order, the police will retain the power of arrest."</p>
<P> Scotland Yard said it welcomed the reclassification of the drug combined with 
maintaining a discretionary police power to intervene. The drug spokesman for 
the Association of Chief Police Officers, Andy Hayman, said, "The retention of 
police power of arrest will enable the police to have greater flexibility in dealing 
with incidents on the street."</p>
<P> Mr. Blunkett insisted that today's move did not constitute legalizing marijuana. 
"All controlled drugs are harmful and will remain illegal," he said. "We must 
concentrate our efforts on the drugs that cause the most harm, while sending a 
credible message to young people."</p>
<P> But Keith Hellawell, Prime Minister Tony Blair's onetime antidrug chief, said 
the new policy "would virtually be decriminalization of cannabis, and this is, 
quite frankly, giving out the wrong message." </p>
<P> He coupled the announcement of his resignation from a government advisory 
post with a strong attack on the policy, saying it would damage communities and 
lead to more, not less, drug use.</p>
<P> "It's actually a technical adjustment which in the reality of the law doesn't 
make a great deal of difference," Mr. Hellawell said, "but it's being bandied 
about by people as a softening of the law."</p>
<P> He said that there had been an increase in marijuana smoking among young people 
and that more people were seeking treatment for its effects. "Why on earth, when 
there are these problems, we change our message and give a softer message, I don't 
know," he said.</p>
<P> Mr. Hellawell, the former chief constable of West Yorkshire, was named the 
government's first antidrug coordinator by Mr. Blair in 1997, but last year he 
was sidelined by Mr. Blunkett from the $160,000-a-year post and made a part-time 
adviser on the international drug trade.</p>
<P> The new police tolerance has been in effect on an experimental basis in two 
London neighborhoods, Lambeth and Brixton. The Conservative leader, Iain Duncan 
Smith, visited the Brixton project on Tuesday and told the Commons today that 
residents had told him it had led to rampant dealing on their streets. He said 
Mr. Blunkett's plan amounted to "handing over drugs policy to criminals on the 
street."</p>
<P> Oliver Letwin, the Conservatives' spokesman on law enforcement, complained 
that "the middle ground of calling it illegal, leaving it in the hands of dealers 
rather than in legitimate tobacconists or whatever, then turning a blind eye to 
it, is the worst of all worlds."</p>
<P> Kate Hoey, a Labor member of Parliament who represents one of the affected 
London areas, said the government could live to regret today's decision because 
of the increasing strength of marijuana being peddled on the street.</p>
<P> "It is a very strong type of cannabis, it's genetically modified, it is not 
perhaps like people tried 20 years ago," she said, "and we have no idea of the 
long-term effects of constant hard smoking that some kids are doing now."</p>
