RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 28 - </b> For president-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his 
leftist Workers' Party (PT), and tens of millions of Brazilians, Monday brought 
the start of a new dream. 
<p>
   Lula's election as the president of the world's eighth largest 
economy in Sunday's runoff represents the triumph of hope over 
fear of change, according to his supporters. Lula garnered 61 
percent of the vote, compared to the 39 percent taken by his 
rival, the ruling coalition's José Serra.
<p> The dream is of real participation in government by the poor and marginalized, 
because the man who will take office on Jan 1 is a former metalworker with just 
four years of formal schooling, who migrated from Brazil's impoverished northeast 
and worked as a shoeshine boy. 
<p>
   Brazil's 115 million voters cast their ballots Sunday -- voting 
is compulsory -- to choose a new president and the governors of 14 
states among candidates who failed to win a majority of the vote 
in the first round of elections.
<p> Lula plans to govern through a Council for Economic and Social Development, 
which will bring together business, trade unions, non- governmental organizations 
(NGOS) and other representatives of civil society, in a ''social pact.'' 
<p>
   Now ''everyone will be heard at the same negotiating table, not 
in nontransparent, separate, parallel negotiations,'' Regina 
Pereira, a retired schoolteacher, told IPS as her family canvassed 
for Lula on the streets of Rio de Janeiro.
<p>
   Pereira's husband, architect José Flavio Monteiro Pessoa, said 
he expected ''tough battles ahead,'' but was confident that ''the 
bankers, speculative capital and the corrupt'' would not win out 
in the end.
<p> Their children, Cecilia and André, who study law and economics, believe the 
PT's ''First Job'' program will provide ''prospects for employment and a future'' 
that young people lack today. 
<p> The program announced by Lula will give subsidies to companies that hire young 
people, thus breaking down the obstacle of ''lack of experience'' that for so 
many stands in the way of entering the labor market. 
<p> The new government will be more participative, said Sergio Haddad, the president 
of the Brazilian Association of Non- Governmental Organizations, along the lines 
of PT municipal governments, in which broad sectors of society share in ''participatory 
budgeting'' schemes, helping decide where city funds will be spent. 
<p>
   The Development Council will also be an important mechanism for 
promoting Lula's social pact, Haddad said in a conversation with 
IPS.
<p>
   Cándido Grzybowski, director of one of the country's leading 
NGOs, the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analysis, 
told IPS that the country's NGOs must be careful not to abandon 
their role as critics and ''defenders of the public cause'' to 
become mere ''collaborators.''
<p>
   Millions in Brazil identify easily with Lula, who is emblematic 
of the country's poor majority: he does not know the exact date of 
his birthday, is not sure how many siblings he has, and 
mispronounces certain words.
<p>
   The president-elect's birth certificate shows that he was born 
on Oct 6, 1945, but his mother always said his real birthday was 
Oct 27 -- a confusion that is common among Brazil's poor, who 
often register their children late or fail to do so at all.
<p>
   If his mother was right, Lula was elected president of this 
country of 170 million, Latin America's giant, the day he turned 
57 years old. But if his birth certificate was correct, his 
birthday fell on the day he won the first round of the elections.
<p>
   His mother had eight children before his father left her and 
formed other families. Lula believes his father had a total of 22 
children.
<p>
   But in his travels around Brazil, Lula is still occasionally 
surprised by people who embrace him and introduce themselves as 
yet another brother or sister.
<p>
   At first glance, it is difficult to see in this thickset man 
with a gravelly voice the charisma that has moved the masses for 
25 years, turning him into one of Brazil's most prominent and 
influential political leaders despite his limited formal 
schooling.
<p>
   Lula was born in the northeast, and at the age of seven 
followed the route taken by so many impoverished people from 
Brazil's poorest region, migrating with his mother and siblings to 
the slums of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city. Mistreated and 
abandoned by his father, he worked as a shoeshine boy and later as 
an errand-boy at a laundry.
<p>
   Through a vocational-technical course, he became a metalworker 
at the age of 18, which changed his life.
<p>
   When he lost his pinky finger in an accident on the job, he had 
to learn how to wash his face without letting the water leak out 
through the spot where his finger should have been, he said in a 
moment of comic relief in the election campaign.
<p>
   He became a trade unionist, and in 1975 was elected president 
of the Union of Metalworkers of Sao Bernardo do Campo, the hub of 
Brazil's auto-making industry.
<p>
   From 1978 to 1981, when Brazil was still under military 
dictatorship, Lula headed historic strikes that turned him into a 
national hero.
<p> Out of those strikes emerged a new trade union movement, which gave rise to 
the 1980 founding, by Lula and other labor and social leaders, of the leftist 
Workers' Party (PT), which brought together militant trade unions, intellectuals, 
and social and religious activists with socialist ideals. 
<p>
   In 1983, Lula also helped found the Central Unica de 
Travalhadores (CUT), the country's largest trade union.
<p>
   Lula was elected to the lower house of parliament in 1986, and 
in 1989 he ran for the presidency for the first time. By just a 
few votes, he was defeated by another young politician, Fernando 
Collor de Mello, who was impeached and removed by parliament in 
1992, for corruption.
<p>
   In 1994 and 1998, Lula was defeated by Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, who was made virtually unbeatable by the success of the 
Plan Real, which he designed as finance minister, that put an end 
to three decades of hyperinflation.
<p> Throughout the 1990s, Lula got ready to stand in this year's elections in 
completely different conditions. He created the Citizenship Institute, to formulate 
public policy proposals, and traveled around the country to gain updated first-hand 
knowledge of the realities experienced by Brazilians from all walks of life. He 
called it an ''intensive course on Brazil.'' 
<p> His gray hairs, now abundant in his thick, dark beard and hair, along with 
his new look -- he now wears stylish business suits -- helped give him an air 
of respectability that dissipated the fears of many Brazilians and the scorn of 
others towards the former factory worker with little formal schooling who meant 
to become president. 
<p>
   In any case, his close familiarity with his country, his newly 
toned-down, moderate discourse, and his constant willingness to 
engage in dialogue, not to mention the plunge in popularity of the 
Cardoso administration, modified his relationship with the middle 
classes and the business community.
<p>
   Nevertheless, Lula ran into some difficulty when it came to 
courting the female vote. His charisma as a trade union leader has 
traditionally had more of an effect on men than women. For that 
reason, he brought his wife, Marisa Leticia da Silva, with whom he 
has been married 28 years and has four children, into his 
campaign.
<p> Lula's triumph represents ''the union of the nation with the people,'' and 
access to power by the marginalized and excluded, said Grzybowski, the director 
of the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analysis. 
<p>
   Lula has put an end to a political and cultural tradition of 
exclusion, regardless of how well his government performs, 
according to the analyst. </p>
