<P>"My government is making a case for war against Iraq that is built upon fear and ignorance, as opposed to the reality of truth and fact. </P>

<P>"We, the people of the United States, are told repeatedly that we face a grave and imminent risk to our national security from a combination of past irresponsible behaviour on the part of Iraq and ongoing efforts by Iraq to re-acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic weapons ... which have been banned since 1991 by a Security Council resolution...</P>

When speaking of international law as set forth by the United Nations Charter, it is impossible to come up with any scenario today that would justify military action against Iraq based upon its current behaviour. </P>

<P>"The truth of the matter is that Iraq has not been shown to possess weapons of mass destruction, either in terms of having retained prohibited capability from the past, or by seeking to re-acquire such capability today...</P>

<P>"Iraq, during nearly seven years of continuous inspection activity by the United Nations, had been certified as being disarmed to a 90-95% level - a figure which includes all the factories used by Iraq to produce weapons of mass destruction, together with the associated production equipment, as well as the vast majority of the products produced by these factories...</P>

<P>"Iraq must loudly reject any intention of possessing these weapons and then work within the framework of international law to demonstrate this a reality. 
<P> The only way that Iraq can achieve this is with the unconditional return of 
UN weapons inspectors, allowing such inspectors unfettered access to sites inside 
Iraq in order to complete the disarmament tasks as set forth in Security Council 
resolutions...</P>
