<p>WASHINGTON  — The principal sponsors of the new campaign finance law have told the Federal Election Commission that its proposed regulations for the campaign system "would severely undermine the new law." </p>
<P> The sharp criticism from the four lawmakers who were the driving force in the seven-year effort to overhaul how campaigns are financed was issued as the commission moved to put in place the regulations for the new system, which is to take effect on Nov. 6, the day after the midterm elections.</p>
<P> The six-member commission, which enforces the rules for financing the presidential and Congressional races, released a draft set of regulations this month to put into effect the central part of the law, a ban on the large unlimited contributions to the parties known as soft money. A 17-day comment period on that section of the draft rules ended on Wednesday. Other parts of the law have yet to be addressed.</p>
<P> Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, wrote the commission that "the soft money ban is the centerpiece of this bill" and that the proposed rules were loose enough to create a loophole that would let the parties use "surrogate actors and entities" to raise soft money.</p>
<P> The two House sponsors, Representatives Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, and Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined the senators in the criticism.</p>
<P> The four legislators argued that the proposed rules had loopholes that would still permit state parties to spend soft money on campaign advertisements that attack or promote federal candidates. The law was intended to stop such advertising.</p>
<P> The lawmakers said the proposed regulations would also roll back some restrictions on how state parties use soft money.</p>
<P> A spokesman for election commission, Bob Biersack, said: "This is the appropriate time to make comments on the draft rule. That's why it's a draft. We specifically encouraged the sponsors to comment. We're glad they did so."</p>
<P> The question of how the agency writes the rules is widely considered particularly delicate by the proponents of change, because of the history of campaign finance. After the Watergate scandal drove President Richard M. Nixon from office, Congress enacted a comprehensive system of limits on contributions.</p>
<P> But an advisory opinion by the elections commission opened the door to soft money in 1978, and the parties swiftly exploited it. By the 1990's, they were routinely raising the six-figure contributions that the law had sought to bar.</p>
<P> "We can't allow that to happen again," said Trevor Potter, general counsel for the Campaign and Media Legal Center, one of several groups that has complained to the election on the draft rules. Mr. Potter said of the panel that "basically they've done a good job" but that there were "a couple of sensitive areas" that might open the door to new contributions of soft money.</p>
<P> The opponents of the law are putting most of their efforts into trying to overturn it in court. Some of them also commented this week to the election commission. The Republican National Committee, taking the opposite tack of the four lawmakers, warned the agency that it risked going too far in holding the parties responsible for fund-raising by outside entities or individuals.</p>
<P> "Holding party committees or campaigns accountable for the actions of others that are beyond their control is not only unfair to political committees and susceptible to abuse by political parties," the Republicans wrote, "but it is also contrary to First Amendment jurisprudence," because it might chill free speech.</p>
<P> The struggle over the agency is probably just beginning. Many of the groups that supported the change in the campaign finance law are starting a campaign to overhaul the commission.</p>
<P> The groups cite examples of how the commission has split along party lines, ensuring no action on complaints on campaign finances. Three commissioners represents each of the two major parties.</p>
<P> This year, it decided not to investigate Mr. McCain's complaint against the Wyly brothers, backers of the George W. Bush campaign, for spending $2 million on advertisements that attacked Mr. McCain's candidacy in the Republican presidential primaries.</p>
<P> The sponsors of the campaign finance law have said they will carefully watch how the commission carries out the new law before deciding whether a new agency is needed.</p>
