<p>Roberto Hernandez remembers looking out the window of his San Ysidro elementary 
classroom and seeing the Border Patrol chasing people "who look like me" across 
the playground. 
<P>When he got older, he was often stopped by the Border Patrol near his San Diego 
County home, even though he had a green card. 
<P>"The military checkpoints are much worse in Palestine," he says, "but for me 
there is a natural link there."

</table>These days, Hernandez's strong feelings about the Israeli-Palestinian quagmire 
have gotten him in big trouble at his school, UC Berkeley. 
<P>Hernandez was one of 79 protesters arrested during an April 9 demonstration 
held by the Students for Justice in Palestine, as part of a campaign to force 
the university to divest from companies with business ties to Israel. 
<P>While the Alameda County District Attorney's office did not file criminal charges 
against those arrested, the university is pursuing campus disciplinary charges 
against Hernandez and 31 other students. 
<P>Hernandez will face a campus hearing Wednesday -- a battle that students characterize 
as a free speech issue but one that the university considers a simple matter of 
protecting other students' rights to an education. 
<P>The university has put a hold on Hernandez's degree, which is preventing him 
from officially graduating and enrolling in his graduate program. That means he 
isn't a student and cannot collect the fellowship he was relying on to pay tuition 
and living expenses. 
<P>"Everything in my life, my politics, is shaped and changed by the border," 
said Hernandez, 23, who grew up as a Mexican citizen just seven blocks from the 
U.S.-Mexican border. 
<P>From one perspective, Roberto Hernandez personifies the traditional American 
success story. His parents are poor immigrants from Guadalajara and Chiapas who 
have little education. 
<P>But he made it to UC Berkeley and excelled throughout his undergraduate years, 
getting involved in the campus community, and earning a campus fellowship and 
a spot in Berkeley's doctoral program in ethnic studies. 
<P>University officials paint quite a different portrait: a rabble-rouser who 
attends virtually every campus protest and who jeopardized his future by participating 
in a takeover of Wheeler Hall last spring. 
<P>Hernandez, they say, not only defied the rules by occupying a campus building 
but also bit a campus police officer while he was being arrested. 
<P>And they say that Hernandez and the other students arrested were warned repeatedly 
against disrupting the "academic mission" of the campus and that they have a right 
to pursue disciplinary charges dealing with the campus code of conduct. 
<P>UC administrators are seeking up to a year's suspension for each of the students. 
<P>But Hernandez, who became a U.S. citizen two years ago, says he is just following 
the values his mother instilled in him. His mother was so proud of her Mexican 
heritage that when she went into labor with him, she traveled to a hospital across 
the border to retain the family's "Mexican nationality." 
<P>Although she had just an eighth-grade education, his mother was always active 
in his school, organizing other parents to improve things and encouraging Hernandez 
and his sister to get involved. 
<P>"My mom brought me up to be involved in the schools," he said, "but it became 
larger than that." 
<P>He became politicized at age 13, when he got swept up in his first "real demonstration," 
a 1992 protest of the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' 
"discovery" of America. 
<P>"It was so huge, and it was beautiful. Five thousand people coming together 
to say no, to take a stand," he said. "That was the beginning for me. It had never 
really clicked for me before. Until that point, I was confused and full of rage, 
but I didn't know how to channel it." 
<P>He began protesting police and Border Patrol brutality and providing support 
and security to the Pastors for Peace caravans headed with food and supplies to 
Cuba. 
<P>In ninth grade, he wrote a paper on what it means to be an American and received 
an F for writing of America as a continent, including Mexico. He then joined MEChA, 
a Chicano student group, for support. 
<P>He was involved in the campaign against Proposition 187, organizing student 
walkouts to protest the measure to deprive undocumented workers of education and 
health and welfare services. (The measure was approved but has since been halted 
by the courts.) 
<P>From then on, he was active on every state proposition affecting minorities, 
including Proposition 209, which eliminated the use of race in university admissions. 
<P>"I think back now not in terms of time, but in terms of propositions," he said. 
<P>He was admitted to UC Berkeley in the last year that affirmative action was 
in place and isn't ashamed to say he probably benefited from the use of racial 
preferences. 
<P>"Affirmative action only opens the door," he said. "We have to work our a-- 
off and earn our degree." 
<P>His apartment is one of an intellectually and politically engaged student, 
with a bed crowded into the corner of a tiny room filled with eight towering bookshelves 
packed with books, mostly about minority issues. The walls are papered with Mexican 
flags, posters of Che Guevara and announcements of political demonstrations. 
<P>"People know of my place here as a mini-Chicano resource center," Hernandez 
said. "I don't have formal library cards, but people do come check out books here." 
<P>Even in his academic life at UC Berkeley, he focused on political issues that 
arose from his upbringing. He has researched the social, political and cultural 
aspects of the border and the functionality of borders internationally. 
<P>Hernandez admits he is involved in a lot of campus political actions but says 
it is because he has been frustrated every time he has tried to work within the 
system. He served as a student senator on campus but found his agenda thwarted 
by politics and partisanship, he said. 
<P>"I try these other formal means of enacting change, but a lot of times we came 
up against these roadblocks," he said. 
<P>Hernandez has been arrested before, during a September 2001 protest of a Daily 
Californian cartoon that many considered racist and anti-Muslim. The charges were 
dropped. 
<P>And he was involved in the highly publicized 1999 demonstrations, where students 
demanded increased support for the ethnic studies program by fasting and camping 
outside Chancellor Robert Berdahl's office. 
<P>But he says his participation is always peaceful. He says the university is 
targeting him because he is so politically active. 
<P>Hernandez's professors -- and even a University of California regent who knows 
him -- believe the university is overreacting to this latest incident because 
of political pressures that label any criticism of Israel as anti- Semitic. 
<P>The entire ethnic studies department signed a letter of support for Hernandez. 
<P>"To see this kid get trashed this way, I just can't see it," said UC Regent 
Alfredo Terrazas, who first met Hernandez in 1998 at a scholarship fund- raising 
event by the Chicano Latino Alumni Club. "For him, it is devastating for his career. 
For the university, it is a shame. And we lose an individual in the Latino community 
who I really believe is going to be a leader." 
<P>Campus spokeswoman Janet Gilmore says that the university's disciplinary charges 
have nothing to do with politics and that pro-Palestinian students who were merely 
protesting and marching around campus have not faced any charges. 
<P>"Clearly, there is not an effort to stop them from exercising their free speech," 
Gilmore said. 
<P>For Hernandez, political dissent could come at a price he was not prepared 
to pay. 
<P>"I wasn't expecting the university to come down on us as hard as they have, 
" he said.</p>
