<p>WASHINGTON, May 15 — Calling the Federal Election Commission a "failed agency" designed by Congress to be ineffective, a group of campaign watchdogs today proposed replacing it with an independent agency headed by a single administrator.</p>
<P> Fred Wertheimer, head of a group called Democracy 21, presented a report by a 14-member task force that concluded, "The F.E.C. is a classic example of a captured agency, one that has become attuned to serving the interests of the community it is supposed to be regulating."</p>
<P> Another committee member, Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, said, "This is probably the only agency in Washington that has done from the beginning exactly what it was intended to do, which was to do nothing."</p>
<P> Four members of Congress who led the fight for this year's campaign finance legislation also appeared with the committee members at today's news conference, not to endorse the task force's plan but to criticize the election commission and say they would watch carefully to see how it carried out the new law before deciding whether a new agency was needed </p>
<P> One of the lawmakers, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he was inclined to a more modest change. Mr. McCain said there should be a system for breaking the 3-to-3 ties that frequently block any action by the commission on issues dividing Democrats and Republicans. Three commissioners represent each party. </p>
<P> Trevor Potter, a former Republican member of the commission who served as its chairman and who was a task force member, complained that the commission was often "shipwrecked on 3-to-3 ties."</p>
<P> The report said Congress, which would have to legislate any changes in the enforcement system, had designed the commission with a political foundation in order to make it ineffective.</p>
<P> But the report did not blame Congress just for the structure of the commission, established in 1974. Since then, it said, "Congress has interfered with and undermined the operation of the F.E.C. in numerous ways; it has cut its budget, tried to fire key staff officials and launched unjustified audits and investigations of agency practices." </p>
<P> The report warned, "No law will be effective if the agency responsible for its enforcement interprets that law contrary to its basic purpose and intent, administratively creates gaping loopholes and tolerates widespread evasion of the law." </p>
<P> The report gave examples of party-line splits that resulted in inaction, like the 2002 decision not to investigate Mr. McCain's complaint against the Wyly Brothers, backers of the George W. Bush campaign, for spending $2 million on advertisements attacking Mr. McCain's 2000 presidential candidacy. </p>
<P> It was equally harsh on 6-to-0 decisions that satisfied both political parties. One such decision in 1988 allowed the General Motors Corporation to provide free cars at both national party conventions. In another, the commission rejected staff advice to seek repayment of federal money from the 1996 Clinton and Dole campaigns, on the ground that they had used private money for general election activities, which are publicly financed.</p>
<P> Thomas Mann, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a task force member, said that while others objected to ties, "I worry about bipartisan logrolls."</p>
<P> Another committee member, Nicole A. Gordon, executive director of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, said a campaign finance agency could succeed, but only if it were nonpartisan. </p>
<P> "The bipartisan model does not work and should be scrapped," Ms. Gordon said. </p>
<P> David M. Mason, the commission chairman, dismissed the criticism as failing to look at the whole record.</p>
<P> He also criticized as ineffective the proposal for using administrative law judges to speed decisions.</p>
<P> "Administrative law judges are not necessarily swift," Mr. Mason said. </p>
<P> Neither the committee members nor the four lawmakers predicted that action on the report was likely soon, though Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he thought legislation would be introduced this year. </p>
