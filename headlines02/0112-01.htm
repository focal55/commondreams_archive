            NEW DELHI   - India's army chief Gen. Sunderajan Padmnabhan on Friday 
dared Pakistan's president and military ruler, Gen Pervez 
Musharraf, to launch a nuclear first strike against his 
country, stepping up bilateral tensions even further. 
<p>
''If he (Musharraf) is man enough, let me correct that, if 
he is mad enough to override international opinion on that 
scale, then surely he must do it (launch a nuclear 
strike),'' Padmanabhan said at a press conference, a day 
before Musharraf was due to make a televised address 
outlining his policy toward 'jihadist' groups operating from 
Pakistan. 
<p>
Following a visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to 
the sub-continent earlier this week to help defuse tension 
as the nuclear-armed neighbors massed troops along their 
3,000 km border, pressure has been growing on Musharraf to 
clearly state his stand on terrorism. 
<p>
''We are looking forward to the speech he (Musharraf) will 
be giving later this week, which I think will be a powerful 
signal to his nation and to India and to the rest of the 
world,'' U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was quoted as 
telling journalists in Washington following a meeting with 
India's Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani on Thursday. 
<p>
Powell prompted Musharraf to include in the address, 
scheduled for Saturday evening, ''a condemnation of 
terrorism of any kind, because it is no longer acceptable in 
the 21st century for nations to live under this kind of 
threat''. 
<p>
For Musharraf, that would be a clear comedown from the 
position he took at last week's South Asian summit in 
Kathmandu, where he reiterated that ''freedom struggles'' 
had to be differentiated from terrorism. 
<p>
Musharraf's reference was to the territory of Kashmir, the 
possession of which is disputed by Pakistan and India when 
they were created by dividing what was British India until 
independence in 1947. 
<p>
Since then, the armies of the two countries have fought each 
other to a standstill along the Line of Control (LoC), which 
runs through Kashmir and across which artillery fire is 
regularly exchanged. 
<p>
India alleges that Pakistan has been arming and training 
'jihadist' groups to foment separatist violence in its 
portion of Kashmir, but Pakistan claims that these are 
indigenous groups fighting for freedom. 
<p>
After a suicide squad made an aborted attempt to blow up 
Indian Parliament on Dec.13, India's normally mild-mannered 
prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said his patience was 
at an end. 
<p>
He and his Cabinet ordered the halving of the strength of 
diplomatic Missions, the recall of India's high commissioner 
in Islamabad and banned flights by Pakistani aircraft over 
Indian airspace. 
<p>
But what set alarm bells ringing internationally was the 
reported redeployment of the bulk of India's more than a 
million-strong army, along with tanks and missile batteries, 
on the border with Pakistan, where US troops fighting the 
war against terror in Afghanistan are based. 
<p>
The 'New York Times' reported Friday that the US national 
security staff has intensified surveillance in the region 
for any evidence of the two countries deploying their 
nuclear arsenals. 
<p>
''We are significantly more worried today than were several 
days ago,'' the 'Times' quoted a senior member of President 
George W Bush's national security staff as saying. 
<p>
Padmanabhan admitted that a nuclear exchange between the two 
neighbors would be ''disastrous'', but was confident that 
India would survive a first strike by Pakistan to inflict 
unacceptable damage on its adversary. 
<p>
''Let me assure you of one thing as surely as I'm alive,'' 
he said. ''Should a nuclear weapon be used against India, 
Indian forces, our assets at sea, economic, human or other 
targets, the perpetrators of that outrage shall be punished 
so severely that their continuation thereafter in any form 
or fray will be doubtful.'' 
<p>
Echoing the stand of other Indian officials, Padmanabhan 
dismissed steps taken by Pakistan since the Dec 13 attack. 
He said the banning of two 'jihadist' groups that India 
named as responsible for the attack on its Parliament and 
the arrest of some of their leaders and cadres was 
''cosmetic'', and meant for the benefit of the US forces 
in Pakistan. 
<p>
''The terrorist cadres have been dispersed -- some to nearby 
villages, others to Pakistan Army units - so that they won't 
come to the notice of US forces,'' he added. 
<p>
In addition to its call for the closure of 'jihadist' camps 
operating from Pakistani territory, India has also demanded 
that Islamabad extradite 20 individuals, on charges ranging 
from hijacking to acts of terrorism. 
<p>
Musharraf, under growing pressure at home not to be seen as 
giving in too much to India, has refused to comply with his. 
He said that Pakistan could try, in its territory, whoever 
was involved in the Indian Parliament attack. 
<p>
India has matched its military posture with a diplomatic 
offensive led by Advani, who is currently campaigning for 
New Delhi's position in Washington as India tries to get the 
United States to bear down on Pakistan under the 
international campaign against terrorism. 
<p>
Powell, who is due to travel to South Asia next week to 
counsel peace, was quoted as saying he has indicated to 
Advani that the United States was hopeful.</p>
