<p> GUANTÁNAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba — A year ago, this century-old military outpost, 
the oldest United States base overseas and the only one in a Communist country, 
was being mothballed by the Navy, having outlived its usefulness as a refueling 
station and a temporary stop for fleeing refugees.</p>
<P> But in the last nine months, with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's pronouncement 
that it was "the least worst place" to hold prisoners from the Afghanistan war, 
Guantánamo has rumbled to life — or as much to life as is possible under a relentless 
Caribbean sun in a parched scrubland pockmarked by cactus trees and populated 
by iguanas and land crabs.</p>
<P> Now, it shows every sign of becoming a permanent penal colony for the human 
detritus of the campaign against terrorism. The first 20 prisoners arrived here 
on Jan. 11. Today there are 598 from 43 countries. Construction is under way on 
204 more cells, which is expected to bring the total to 816 in October, almost 
half way to the planned 2,000.</p>
<P> There were 1,500 military personnel here in January; now there are 4,000. 
Those overseeing the prison operation have started their own weekly newspaper. 
In perhaps the strongest sign of permanence, the guards' huts are being outfitted 
with indoor plumbing.</p>
<P> "We're talking years rather than months," said Capt. Robert A. Buehn Jr. of 
the Navy, the base commander. He said that he had budgeted for the prison through 
2005 but that he expected to include the prison in his 20-year plan as well. "I 
would do it just to be conservative," he said. "You'd better plan for it."</p>
<P> But for all the planning, no one seems to know quite what to do with the prisoners.</p>
<P> "They are the forgotten captives of the war," Scott L. Silliman, executive 
director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University 
Law School, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<P> Once Congress was assured that the prisoners were being treated humanely, 
he said, they lost what visibility they had. "They are outside our borders and 
not in our court system," Mr. Silliman said.</p>
<P> Their significance today, he said, "stems not from who they are, how they 
are being treated or how horrendous their conduct probably was, but what they 
represent to international law."</p>
<P> The Bush administration has denied them the status of prisoners of war, instead 
calling them enemy combatants, and is convinced that the law permits the detention 
of such combatants until the end of hostilities to prevent their return to the 
battlefield. The end of hostilities in this case could be defined as the end of 
the campaign against terrorism, which could mean detention, without charge and 
without access to lawyers, for years. This has appalled human rights groups and 
even drew public criticism from the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
which normally makes its complaints in private.</p>
<P> In a new report, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said the administration 
had "been using the term `unlawful combatant' — a term not found in international 
law — as a kind of magic wand, waving it to avoid well-established standards of 
U.S. and international law."</p>
<P> Critics say the United States is picking and choosing which elements of the 
Geneva Convention to apply and which to ignore — and that it is ignoring a big 
one in not holding individual hearings to determine the status of each prisoner. 
This, they say, is part of a larger pattern of the United States thumbing its 
nose at the international community, as the Bush administration has done in asserting 
a right to strike at Iraq unilaterally, in insisting that Americans not be held 
accountable before the new International Criminal Court at The Hague, and by spurning 
an international global-climate treaty.</p>
<P> This pattern could come into still sharper relief as the United States subjects 
the prisoners here to military tribunals over the objections of several allies 
that oppose the death penalty. The possibility of tribunals had seemed derailed 
by both controversy and other priorities, but officials now say that planning 
for them is back on track.</p>
<P> The officials said that the administration's legal experts, after a busy year 
of distractions with the novel terrorist-related cases of John Walker Lindh, Zacarias 
Moussaoui and Yasser Hamdi, were refocusing on tribunals for the Guantánamo prisoners 
and that the trials would almost certainly be held here, outside the jurisdiction 
of United States courts. (The Bush administration has successfully argued in court 
that federal courts have no jurisdiction in Guantánamo because it is under Cuban 
sovereignty; the United States leases the Navy base from Cuba for $4,000 a year, 
although Fidel Castro refuses to cash the checks because he disputes the legitimacy 
of the arrangement.)</p>
<P> Legal experts said the process of preparing for the tribunals would be so 
painstaking that it might be several months before any began.</p>
<P> Ruth Wedgwood, who is an expert in international law at Yale Law School and 
close to the Bush administration, said much time would probably be consumed with 
finding the right people — both to prosecute the government's cause and to be 
prosecuted.</p>
<P> "You'd have to pick good people for prosecutor and judge, think through the 
logistics of putting on trials, do the very, very difficult task of scrubbing 
what evidence you have, deciding which are most compelling as criminal cases, 
and think through what evidence you could make public, since you don't want to 
have to close the proceedings and have an all-secret trial," she said.</p>
<P> Mr. Silliman said, however, that as more time goes by, he was skeptical that 
such evidence could be produced, especially against the many prisoners here who 
are believed to be foot soldiers for the terrorists and ignorant of any useful 
intelligence. He predicted that international pressure would build on the United 
States to release some of them to their native countries — pressure that could 
intensify as the United States tries to maintain its coalition in the campaign 
against terrorism.</p>
<P> Delegations from many of those countries have visited Guantánamo, seeking 
to establish that their citizens are being treated humanely and to negotiate for 
their release. Officials here said some delegations also took part in the interrogations 
of their citizens, a process that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
believes is not going so well. In its budget request for next year, the panel 
said interrogation efforts in Guantánamo "have been hampered by a lack of appropriate 
training, a dearth of language-skilled personnel, and a lack of depth and breadth 
of analytic expertise."</p>
<P> Khalid al-Odah, the father of a prisoner from Kuwait, said in a telephone 
interview that American officials told Kuwaiti officials who visited the base 
that there was no evidence linking his son and a dozen other Kuwaiti prisoners 
with crimes and that they would be at the top of the list of those to be released. 
Mr. Odah's statements could not be confirmed with American officials here. Families 
of other prisoners from other countries have made similar assertions of innocence 
about their sons, but there has been no corroboration from Americans.</p>
<P> Only two prisoners who have been brought to Guantánamo have left. One is Mr. 
Hamdi, who was discovered to have been born in the United States; he is now in 
the Navy brig in Norfolk, Va. The other was an Afghan prisoner who received a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia and returned to Afghanistan, where he is reportedly 
in a state mental hospital.</p>
<P> Mr. Odah and others said they had been given no timetable for any possible 
release of the Kuwaitis or others, and as more time passes, they grow increasingly 
concerned about the prisoners' legal limbo and its effect on their psychological 
state.</p>
<P> Officials here say that the legal limbo is Topic A among the prisoners and 
that it underlies the mounting mental health problems in the camp. Four prisoners 
made serious efforts at killing themselves this summer, stringing up their bedsheets 
in their cells and trying to hang themselves. At least 30 others made less serious 
attempts, some using plastic utensils, others banging their heads against the 
walls. Many are taking anti-depressants, and 80 prisoners are now in solitary 
confinement. Only two prisoners are hospitalized now, both with orthopedic problems, 
indicating that the more pressing issues are behavioral and psychological.</p>
<P> That holds true for the guards as well, and their commanders are keenly aware 
that duty here is stressful in itself. The base newspaper reminded readers this 
week in a banner headline that "September is suicide prevention month," and noted 
that suicide is the second-leading cause of death in the military after accidents.</p>
<P> Capt. Albert J. Shimkus Jr. of the Navy, who runs the hospital here, said 
57 prisoners were being treated for mental illnesses, including post-traumatic 
stress disorder. He added that several prisoners have tried to hurt themselves 
as a way of attracting attention. Some scratch themselves, he said, and one "threatened 
to swallow their tongue, which is impossible, and yet he attracted attention."</p>
<P> "We are beginning to understand our environment better," he said, noting that 
the language barriers were still significant but that the mental health team, 
which also attends to the guards, was becoming "more robust in anticipation of 
interceding with their mental health needs." Captain Shimkus said that, with the 
uncertainty over the prisoners' fates, mental health problems could be expected 
to increase.</p>
<P> Even Mr. Rumsfeld has allowed for the possibility that some of these prisoners 
might have been victims of circumstance, caught in the wrong place at the wrong 
time. But without individual hearings to determine the prisoners' status, without 
charges and trials, critics see Guantánamo as a synonym for human rights violations. 
While there is no indication of physical torture, and the prisoners are allowed 
to observe their religion, grow back their beards and have their meals prepared 
according to their customs, they still lack the basic legal rights that many countries, 
including the United States, have agreed are fundamental even to warriors.</p>
<P> Captain Buehn rejected that characterization, saying he was proud of the community 
that had evolved here. "I don't want the U.S. Naval Base, Guantánamo Bay, to be 
viewed in a sense as anything unfair, brutal, human rights violations," he said. 
"Certainly, that's not what's going on here."</p>
<P> Gen. Rick Baccus of the Army, who commands the detention center, took the 
opportunity of a Sept. 11 memorial service to try to rebut the criticism. "While 
the public debates the technicalities of how these people should be classified," 
he said, "we will continue to follow the traditions of humane treatment." He added: 
"In other countries, these detainees would not be heard from again."</p>
