America's automobiles are headed in the wrong direction -- at least when it comes 
to fuel efficiency, according to new data from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
<P>A tiny 3.5 percent of 2003 passenger vehicles -- just 33 of the 934 models 
now rolling into showrooms -- can drive 30 miles or more on 1 gallon of gasoline, 
according to an analysis of the EPA's 2003 Fuel Economy guide released Tuesday. 
<P>That compares to 5.5 percent of 2002 vehicles, or 48 of the 865 models released 
last year, that get 30 mpg or better, according to an analysis by the Associated 
Press. 
<P>"It's very unfortunate, given what's going on in the Middle East, that automakers 
are continuing to offer products that increase oil dependency," said David Friedman, 
senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Berkeley. 
<P>The EPA has estimated that a driver can save $1,500 over five years by switching 
to a car that gets 30 mpg from a 20 mpg model. That's assuming a cost of $1.50 
per gallon of gas and 15,000 miles driven each year. 
<P>The possibility of a war against Iraq has dramatically increased the price 
of crude oil, and lawmakers in Washington and Sacramento are tussling over regulations 
to lower pollution and conserve the world's limited supply of fossil fuel. 
<P>Americans' penchant for large, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles is largely 
responsible for a steady decline in fuel efficiency since 1988. Light trucks including 
SUVs, whose average fuel efficiency was 17.3 mpg last year, now account for about 
half of the new vehicles sold in the United States. 
<P>Diane Steed, president of the pro-SUV Coalition for Vehicle Choice, said fuel-efficient 
vehicles such as hybrids are well and good -- "but they are not very popular in 
the marketplace." The EPA's 10 most fuel efficient models typically make up less 
than 2 percent of auto sales, she said. 
<P>
<b>'VALUING OTHER ATTRIBUTES'</b>
<P>"Right now people are valuing other attributes -- things like towing ability, 
seating capacity and cargo space -- higher than fuel economy," Steed said. "That's 
because the price of gasoline is pretty cheap at this point." 
<P>Environmental advocates called Tuesday's report an indictment of American automakers, 
which failed to produce any of the 10 most fuel-efficient vehicles, ceding that 
ground to Japanese and German companies. 
<P>"Until American manufacturers start using modern technologies like better engines, 
better transmissions and better aerodynamics, we will continue to pay too much 
for gas, pollute too much and be in hock up to our eyeballs to OPEC," said Dan 
Becker, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C. 
<P>The Honda Insight, a gas-electric hybrid, occupied the top two spots with a 
manual transmission model that gets 64 mpg and an automatic that comes in at 56 
mpg. The Toyota Prius automatic, another hybrid, ranked third at 48 mpg. 
<P>The Honda Civic manual hybrid ranked fourth and the all-gas automatic Honda 
Civic ranked fifth. The manual Toyota Echo occupied the eighth spot while diesel-burning 
Volkswagen New Beetles, Golfs and Jettas rounded out the top 10. 
<P>Toyota Motor Corp., whose Prius was the first electric car, has pledged to 
make all of its products hybrids by 2012 and is gunning to increase its global 
market share to 15 percent by 2010. 
<P>Among SUVs, the Toyota RAV4 got the best gas mileage, 27 mpg, while five vehicles 
tied for the worst with 14 mpg: the Cadillac Escalade, the Cadillac Escalade Ext, 
the GMC K1500 Yukon, the GMC K1500 Yukon XL and the Land Rover Discovery Series 
II. 
<P>According to the AP analysis, the average fuel efficiency of new models dropped 
for the third year in a row with the 2003 vintage to 20.1 mpg, a 6 percent drop 
from the peak of vehicle fuel economy in the late 1980s. 
<P>While the AP number is a simple average of all new models, the EPA tracks fuel 
efficiency weighted by sales in its annual Fuel Economy Trends Report, which is 
due out later this year. 
<P>Last year the average fuel efficiency as measured by the EPA was 20.4 mpg, 
and it is expected to come in between 20 and 21 in this year's report, said Dan 
Zinger, assistant director in the EPA's office of transportation and air quality. 
<P>At its peak in 1988, U.S. vehicles averaged 22.4 mpg, Zinger said. 
<P>
<b>TOUCHY TOPIC IN CALIFORNIA</b>
<P>The new vehicle data is sure to fuel the heated debate over auto regulation, 
both in California and nationally. 
<P>Gov. Gray Davis in July signed landmark legislation requiring automakers to 
meet not-yet-finalized vehicle emission standards with their 2009 models. California 
is the first state to impose such regulations. 
<P>The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, which could not be reached Tuesday, 
has pledged to fight the bill. 
<P>Congress attempted to address fuel efficiency in a wide-ranging energy bill 
this year, but the standards got watered down significantly and the bill had not 
passed when Congress adjourned in the fall. The issue is likely to be left to 
the next Congress. 
<P>Big automakers and the Justice Department, meanwhile, are fighting a California 
mandate that 10 percent of cars offered for sale in the state be electric, or 
"zero emission." That requirement was supposed to go into effect next year. 
<P>And California's phaseout of the gasoline additive MTBE, which is believed 
to pollute ground water, is expected to raise the price of gasoline over the next 
year. 
<P>The EPA's Fuel Economy Guide, which provides detailed statistics for each 2003 
model car, van and truck sold in the United States., can be downloaded at <A HREF="http://www.fueleconomy.gov" target="_new">www.fueleconomy.gov</A>.
