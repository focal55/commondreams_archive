<p>UNITED NATIONS  - France and Russia want key  changes in a U.S.-drafted resolution on Iraqi disarmament that  the United States is not prepared to make during Friday's  review of the document among all 15 council members.<p>The proposed U.S. resolution, co-sponsored by Britain, give  U.N. arms inspectors far-reaching rights and privileges in  ferreting out any weapons of mass destruction programs in Iraq.<p>It declares Iraq in "material breach" of U.N. resolutions  and warns Iraq of "serious consequences" if it thwarts U.N.  weapons inspections, language Russia and France fear the United  States can interpret as sufficient for military action.<p>In preparation for the Friday closed-door council session  France held meetings with the 10 temporary members of the  council to argue against having "material breach" in the text  and changing other key U.S. demands.<p>But Secretary of State Colin Powell as well as national  security adviser Condoleezza Rice have made clear this week  that deleting these provisions were not negotiable, although  they were open to other changes in the text.<p>Russia produced its own draft, almost identical to one  France circulated several weeks ago but did not formally  introduce it. At the same time French envoys distributed  another set of proposals they are using as a negotiating  stance, diplomats said.<p>Both Russia and France want U.N. inspectors to report on  Iraq's cooperation with arms inspections to the Security  Council before considering the use of military force.<p>Iraq last month allowed the arms inspectors to return  unconditionally. They left in December 1998 on the eve of a  U.S.-British bombing raid.<p>EVERY VOTE CRUCIAL<p>The United States, Britain, France, Russia and China are  permanent Security Council members with veto power. For a  resolution to be adopted, nine "yes" votes are needed and no  veto, which means every vote is crucial.<p>Neither Russia nor France has threatened a veto but are  hoping the 10 non-permanent members of the council will insist  on enough changes to force Washington to make more concessions.<p>The 10 non-permanent members are: Bulgaria, Cameroon,     Colombia, Guinea, Ireland, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, Singapore  and Syria.<p>U.S. officials, who believe they have a majority,  are  hoping for a vote next week but Powell appeared relaxed about  the timetable in comments to leading businessmen at a Pacific  Rim conference in Los Cabos, Mexico.<p>"I am hopeful that in the not too distant future, the next  days, a week or two, the United Nations will act in a powerful  way and let Iraq know that it must obey or suffer consequences  for continued disobedience," he said late on Thursday."<p>Colombian Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso told reporters  before the meeting that the U.S. draft "was getting a little  bit more support but it's not there yet."<p>Council members are expected to spend most of Friday going  through the text slowly, with each member suggesting word  changes. On Monday chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and  Mohammed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, give the council their views on the draft resolution.<p>The United States and Britain, meanwhile are lobbying the  nations with seats on the council in various capitals in the  world as well as in New York.<p>Chinese President Jiang Zemin meets President Bush at his  Texas ranch on Friday. Beijing, which has spoken out against a  war with Iraq, is expected to abstain on any resolution the  council may adopt.<p>Powell, at the edges of a meeting of foreign and trade  ministers from the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  group, held separate talks on Thursday with the Russian Foreign  Minister Igor Ivanov after lobbying Mexico, which had earlier  agreed with France on the he resolution.<p>Powell also spoke to Singapore, which has a council seat,  telling Lee Yock Suan, a second minister for foreign affairs,  he hoped his country would make its support known "at the  meeting that will be in New York."<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, on Thursday likened the  U.S. draft to a declaration of war against Baghdad and the  United Nations. He said Washington was using the world body "to  create justifications for attacking Iraq."<p>In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Sabri  said he did not understand why a new resolution was needed in  the first place. He also asked why the weapons inspectors had  not come to Baghdad to begin work, according to U.N. officials.</p>
