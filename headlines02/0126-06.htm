SYDNEY  - Refugee activists called for rallies
around Australia on Sunday to protest at the government's
treatment of asylum seekers as detainees continued hunger
strikes and attempted suicides at an outback refugee camp.
<p>An Immigration Department spokesman said an illegal
immigrant who had thrown himself onto a razor wire fence at the
controversial Woomera detention center on Saturday was being
monitored in hospital but gave no details about his condition.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

Protestors, with their mouths taped shut, rally in Sydney. The protestors taped their mouths as a symbolic gesture of support for illegal immigrants at the Woomera detention center who have sewn their lips together. A senior government advisor on immigration quit over Australia's hardline treatment of refugees, dealing Canberra an embarrassing blow on Wednesday as the lip-sewing protests and hunger strikes by detained asylum seekers escalated.

</table></font>The detainee who tried to escape from the camp, located
under the baking sun of the desert 295 miles north of Adelaide,
was one of 200 asylum seekers who staged a violent protest at
the months it takes to process refugee claims.<p>``One detainee is in...hospital being monitored by medical
staff and receiving appropriate treatment,'' the spokesman said.<p>He added that three children had been taken to hospital
overnight for observation as almost 200 Woomera inmates
continued a hungerstrike for a 12th straight day. Some have
tried to hang themselves and others have swallowed shampoo and
painkillers.<p>Refugee groups on Sunday planned to hold demonstrations in
Sydney and Melbourne in sympathy for the illegal immigrants at
Woomera, some 35 of whom still had their mouths symbolically
sewn shut with a strand of thread.<p>``This just shows the level of desperation, these people
just got nothing to lose, they are throwing themselves on razor
wire,'' said Judy McVey of the Refugee Action Collective in
Melbourne.<p>She said 200 people would rally outside the Maribyrnonga
detention center in the southern city where dozens of asylum
seekers and visa overstayers have staged a sympathy
hungerstrike.<p>In Sydney, activists planned a demonstration outside the
Villawood detention center and detainees there said they would
also start to refuse food and water.<p>The protests have already spread to the Curtin refugee camp
in Western Australia as the government's policy of detaining
all illegal immigrants spirals into an international
embarrassment.<p>The government has refused to bow to what it calls moral
blackmail and insists it will not be at fault if people die.<p>PRESSURE MOUNTS<p>But pressure has been mounting on conservative Prime
Minister John Howard, who won re-election in November partly on
a tough stand against boatpeople, to show more compassion for
the asylum seekers, many of whom have fled war and repression.<p>Saturday was Australia Day, commemorating the colonization
of the Australian continent by the British in 1788, and
commentators urged the country to remember it was founded on
immigration.<p>``The Australia I wanted to celebrate yesterday is a
fair-minded, tolerant place, where everyone's given a fair go,''
wrote Sue Williams in Sunday's Sydney Morning Herald.<p>``Instead, I found myself in a country that a few
politicians, through a pungent blend of myopia, thirst for
power, idiocy and breathtaking lack of any sort of compassion
whatsoever, have been allowed carelessly to poison and trash.''<p>At Woomera, where around 900 illegal immigrants are housed
in a camp set up on a former rocket range, security guards on
Saturday night ordered the media to move out of sight.<p>An Australian Broadcasting Corp journalist was arrested
when she refused as the government tries to draw a veil over
the camp.<p>The government's hard line, and a policy of intercepting
all new boatpeople at sea with warships and shipping them to
camps it has paid Pacific islands to set up, enjoys broad
public support.<p>But the first cracks have begun to appear, with opposition
center-left Labor, which had previously backed the policy, on
Saturday urging the government to free detained children.
<p>Around 8,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Australia over
the past two years, a trickle according to the United Nations.
<p>But the island continent of just 19.3 million people also
takes 10,000 refugees a year formally resettled under a U.N.
program and another 50,000 permanent migrants.
