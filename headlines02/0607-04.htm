<p>Refugees were among the victims worst hit in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon  as people forced to flee their homelands faced new obstacles to finding safe haven, especially in the United States which temporarily froze admissions of all refugees, according to a new report released Thursday by the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR).
<p>
New security measures, fueled by increasing wariness toward immigrants in Europe and Asia, as well as shortfalls in funding for the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) programs in Africa, also eroded protections for one of the world's most vulnerable populations, according to the 'World Refugee Survey 2002.'
<p>



Thousands of refugees in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and elsewhere who expected to enter the U.S. were stranded by the freeze, while tightened admissions procedures in Europe made it more difficult to gain asylum there, the 280-page report said.
<p>



"At a time when freedom is under attack, the world is turning its back on people fleeing war, persecution, and terror in search of freedom," said USCR's executive director Lavinia Limon. "This indifference towards refugees undermines our stated values," she added.
<p>



Altogether, conflict and persecution brought the total number of the world's refugees to 14.9 million by the end of 2001, the largest number since 1995 and an increase of some 400,000 from the year 2000. Some 22 million more people were internally displaced in similar ways.
<p>



Among the newly uprooted were some 1.8 million Africans driven from their homes by war, armed insurgencies, or violent civil unrest, especially in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Burundi, Liberia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, and Senegal.
<p>



Many of those who made it across international boundaries still faced harsh conditions due to the failure of major donors to provide more than US&#36;20 million for regional UNHCR programs.
<p>



But refugees from other regions, particularly South and Central Asia and the Middle East, also fared poorly during 2001, particularly after September 11 when Pakistan, Iran, and other neighbors closed their borders as war loomed over Afghanistan.
<p>



Before the attacks, Afghans represented the largest population of uprooted people, with an estimated 4.5 million living outside the country, mainly in Iran and Pakistan, and another one million displaced inside Afghanistan.
<p>



Although by mid-2002, more than half a million Afghans in Pakistan and Iran had made their way back home, international donors have not kept pace with the costs of repatriating them, raising questions about whether the returns are sustainable.
<p>



"Let us hope that the international community, led by the United States, will not squander this opportunity to end the misery and bring stability to this corner of the globe," said Bill Frelick, the Survey's chief editor, who noted that only about two-thirds of UNHCR's budget for the Afghan problem had been provided by donors to date.
<p>



If Afghan refugees ended the year with more hopeful prospects, however, the same was not true of the world's second largest refugee population, the Palestinians, 4.1 million of whom live outside their traditional homeland or in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza.
<p>



As violence intensified between Israel and Palestinians over 2001 and well into 2002, at least 26,000 left the occupied territories for Jordan and did not return, according to the report which noted that by October last year, some 64 percent of the 1.4 million refugees in the occupied territories were living below the poverty line, 80 percent in Gaza alone.
<p>



The three-month U.S. freeze brought total refugee admissions for 2001 to their lowest point since 1987. On October 1, there were approximately 23,000 refugees around the world who had already been approved for admission due to their "well-founded fear of persecution." But they had to wait for three months they were able to enter.
<p>



Moreover, the anti-immigration measures adopted by Washington had a ripple effect elsewhere through the hemisphere as Mexico and Central American countries stepped up their detentions and deportations of undocumented migrants. In addition, the U.S. began detaining asylum seekers from Haiti as a matter of policy, even after they had proven to an immigration officer that they had a "credible fear" of persecution if they were returned home.
<p>



Europe also witnessed setbacks for refugee protections in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as Britain and Germany joined the U.S. in passing anti-terrorism laws that significantly curbed the rights of immigrants and refugees inside their borders. Other traditionally liberal Western European countries tightened border controls and asylum-screening processes.
