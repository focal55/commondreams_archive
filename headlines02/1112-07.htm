Chile - Members of the international nongovernmental coalition <a href="http://www.speciessurvivalnetwork.org/" target="_new">Species 
Survival Network</a> were "shocked" to hear the United States offer a plan today 
that would allow for a renewed international commercial trade in stockpiled elephant 
ivory within the next three years. 
<p> The U.S. amendment language came without warning at the 12th conference of 
Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
during debate over a proposal from Botswana to allow the trade in 20 metric tons 
of ivory and also allow for an annual quota for ivory sales. 
<p> The U.S. language was announced moments before the European Union announced 
its opposition to the ivory trade at this time.

The head of the United States delegation, Judge Craig Manson, admitted at a briefing 
this evening that the United States had not shared its amendment language with 
either the European Union, or the ivory trade proponent countries before offering 
it on the floor, said Adam Roberts, senior research associate for the Animal Welfare 
Institute, a Washington, DC based member organization of the Species Survival 
Network. 
<p> The newly articulated U.S. position comes as a surprise because on the second 
day of the CITES conference, November 4, Judge Manson said the United States "remains 
concerned regarding any resumption in this trade because of potential effects 
on elephant populations and ongoing monitoring efforts." 
<p> Judge Manson is assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks in the 
U.S. Department of the Interior. A former California Superior Court judge, he 
previously served as general counsel for the California Department of Fish and 
Game. 
<p> Judge Manson admitted to receiving 12,000 emails objecting to any relaxation 
in the ivory trade ban from concerned citizens in the last 48 hours. 
<p> "The United States continues to be strongly committed to African elephant 
conservation," he said on November 4. "Regardless of the decision reached by the 
160 nations that are part of CITES, ivory imports to the United States will continue 
to be prohibited under both the Endangered Species Act and the African Elephant 
Conservation Act." 
<p> Botswana is one of five African countries that has proposed at this CITES 
meeting to resume the international ivory trade. The other countries are South 
Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia. Together, all five countries have proposed 
to export 87 metric tons of stockpiled ivory, the tusks of about 11,000 elephants. 
<p> The countries also asked permission to export a total of 13 metric tons of 
ivory on an annual basis. 
<p> Each proposal is being considered separately at the CITES meeting. Botswana, 
the first to be considered, is seeking to export 20 metric tons of ivory at first 
and then four metric tons annually thereafter. Kenya and India are opposed to 
the resumption of the elephant ivory trade. They have proposed to the CITES meeting 
that all African elephant populations be listed on CITES Appendix I which prohibits 
international trade. 
<p> "Why on earth did the U.S. not share its language with the EU?" asked Will 
Travers, president of the Species Survival Network and CEO of the Born Free Foundation. 
He warns that the U.S. decision may undermine the European Union´s strong position 
against the ivory trade. 
<p> "An agreement could have been worked out that pleased all relevant Parties 
if the U.S. had not acted unilaterally. The EU clearly stated that the ivory trade 
should not resume before the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties to 
CITES in 2005 has agreed to this trade. The U.S. must incorporate this timing 
in its amendment language before it is voted upon tomorrow," Travers demanded. 
<p> Elephant conservationists fear that restarting the legal ivory would act as 
a mask for an illegal trade based on poached elephants that is already thriving. 
<p> Poaching has wiped out over 3,600 elephants in the last two years and customs 
officials around the world have intercepted at least 50 metric tons of illegal 
ivory in the same period, warns Susie Watts who chairs the Species Survival Network's 
Elephant Working Group. 
<p> African countries have agreed by consensus to the re-opening of ivory trade 
under strict regulations. The agreement was reached at a late October meeting 
of 24 of the 37 African elephant range states, that is the countries inhabited 
by elephants. 
<p> Kenya has entered a formal reservation to the African agreement on ivory trade 
announced at the African Elephant Range States Dialogue, questioning the process 
by which the compromise was achieved, and the role of the CITES Secretariat in 
leading the negotiations 
<p>The Kenya/India proposal was not discussed when negotiating a compromise despite 
the fact that a number of countries expressed support for the proposal, and India, 
a co-proponent on the Kenya proposal was not permitted to attend the meeting. 
<p> Kenya Wildlife Service Director Joseph Kioko objects to the renewed ivory 
trade because, he says, previous ivory quota systems devised by CITES failed to 
protect elephants because enormous and growing markets in the East had the capacity 
to consume more ivory than Africa could legally supply, resulting in enormous 
volumes of illegal ivory trafficking. 
<p> Under Appendix II, which permits trade under strict regulations, even with 
an ivory quota system, African elephants were predicted to decline to extinction 
within 10 years. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population declined 
by 53 percent, Kioko points out. 
<p> By 1989, it was estimated that 90 percent of ivory in trade came from poached 
elephants. The 1989 CITES ivory trade ban is working, says Kioko, as evidenced 
by the fact that in the 10 years after the ban, the continental African elephant 
population was no longer in decline. 
<p> Many of the causes of the failure of the Appendix II listing and ivory quota 
system are still a threat to elephant populations today, Kioko warns. "These include 
poor regulations, corruption, access to arms, poor enforcement, no monitoring, 
and the existence of numerous loopholes." 
<p> Delegates to the CITES conference must vote on the elephant ivory trade issue 
in plenary session before the conference closes November 15. </p>
