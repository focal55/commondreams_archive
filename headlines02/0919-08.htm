<p>COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Even on a day when a late-summer rain coats the woods, 
it is clear that Idaho Panhandle National Forest is sick.</p>
<p>Beetles have sucked life from thousands of acres. Floods have torn out mountainsides 
and stirred up old mining pollution. A century of fire suppression and logging 
have radically altered the forest fabric.</p>
<p>To save this forest, one of the nation's biggest at 2.5 million acres, federal 
officials have concluded that they have to burn or log sections of it, tear out 
some roads and then hope that nature takes over the healing.</p>
<p>The Bush administration and Western Republicans like that idea, especially 
the logging part. But the administration is pushing to go further: to suspend 
environmental laws and citizen appeals so logging in dangerously fire-prone forests 
like this one can be done without disruption. The White House has asked Congress 
to exempt about 10 million acres of federal forestland from environmental reviews 
to speed treatment of overgrown forests.</p>
<p>But as the Bush plan moves through the Senate this week in the form of a rider 
promoted by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the resistance among environmentalists 
and some Western politicians has grown fierce. A tentative peace that fell over 
public forests this summer, during one of the biggest most disastrous wildfire 
years in history, has been replaced by a political battle that threatens forest 
management.</p>
<p>Environmentalists say President Bush is using fire treatment as a way to let 
the timber industry log without laws.</p>
<p>Gov. John Kitzhaber, D-Ore., accuses the administration of betraying an agreement 
among Western governors to treat fire-prone forests without suspending the law 
or taking away judicial appeals. Bush signed on to the governors' 10-year plan 
last May, but then took it a step further in an initiative unveiled three weeks 
ago.</p>
<p>Opposition to the Bush plan promises to be particularly intense here in the 
Idaho Panhandle, which has at least one legendary trout stream and a tradition 
rich in silver mining and logging. Several retail-level environmental groups have 
persistently thwarted plans here to treat forests by cutting down trees.</p>
<p>All 16 proposals to log or thin the Panhandle's woods in the last two years 
were stalled by appeals from these groups, forest officials said. Still, the plans 
are moving ahead, usually in a modified form to answer the concerns of critics.</p>
<p>One logging plan would cut 1,400 acres in an area that holds water for thousands 
of people in Idaho and Eastern Washington. It has been appealed by the Lands Council, 
based in Spokane. The group also appealed another plan, which called for quick 
removal of beetle-infested trees.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of dead and dying trees out there that need treatment," said 
Dave O'Brien, spokesman for the managers of the Panhandle National Forest. "But 
the law gets very difficult to comply with. We end up spending so much time just 
trying to make these forest decisions bulletproof."</p>
<p>The biggest hindrance to healthy forests, Bush officials say, are laws that 
force managers of public land to spend too much time responding to objections 
from citizens.</p>
<p>But what the Bush administration characterizes as "gridlock" and "analysis 
paralysis" is seen by others as the messy but necessary products of making land 
decisions in a democracy. The president's plan, they say, would take the public 
out of public forest management.</p>
<p>"This plan is about as extreme, wrongheaded and overreaching as it could possibly 
be," said Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.</p>
<p>The wilderness group is not opposed to thinning forests for fire prevention 
near urban areas, but does object to large-scale logging in the name of forest 
health.</p>
<p>Even if the Senate approves part of the Bush plan this week, and environmental 
laws are suspended for the one year called for in the Senate amendment, the Forest 
Service has an enormous task in trying to reduce fire risk in the West. About 
70 million acres of Forest Service land are dry, overgrown and ready to burn after 
a century of fire suppression. The Forest Service no longer talks of preventing 
fires in these areas, but letting fire do the work it once did in the natural 
world.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely critical that we get fire back into those woods," said Dale 
Bosworth, the chief of the Forest Service, in an interview.</p>
