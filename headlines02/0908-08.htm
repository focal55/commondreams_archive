<p>THE US and Britain sold Saddam Hussein the technology and materials Iraq needed 
to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.
<p> Reports by the US Senate's committee on banking, housing and urban affairs 
-- which oversees American exports policy -- reveal that the US, under the successive 
administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr, sold materials including 
anthrax, VX nerve gas, West Nile fever germs and botulism to Iraq right up until 
March 1992, as well as germs similar to tuberculosis and pneumonia. Other bacteria 
sold included brucella melitensis, which damages major organs, and clostridium 
perfringens, which causes gas gangrene.
<p>Classified US Defense Department documents also seen by the Sunday Herald show 
that Britain sold Iraq the drug pralidoxine, an antidote to nerve gas, in March 
1992, after the end of the Gulf war. Pralidoxine can be reverse engineered to 
create nerve gas.
<p>The Senate committee's reports on 'US Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related 
Dual-Use Exports to Iraq', undertaken in 1992 in the wake of the Gulf war, give 
the date and destination of all US exports. The reports show, for example, that 
on May 2, 1986, two batches of bacillus anthracis -- the micro-organism that causes 
anthrax -- were shipped to the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education, along with 
two batches of the bacterium clostridium botulinum, the agent that causes deadly 
botulism poisoning.
<p>One batch each of salmonella and E coli were shipped to the Iraqi State Company 
for Drug Industries on August 31, 1987. Other shipments went from the US to the 
Iraq Atomic Energy Commission on July 11, 1988; the Department of Biology at the 
University of Basrah in November 1989; the Department of Microbiology at Baghdad 
University in June 1985; the Ministry of Health in April 1985 and Officers' City, 
a military complex in Baghdad, in March and April 1986.
<p>The shipments to Iraq went on even after Saddam Hussein ordered the gassing 
of the Kurdish town of Halabja, in which at least 5000 men, women and children 
died. The atrocity, which shocked the world, took place in March 1988, but a month 
later the components and materials of weapons of mass destruction were continuing 
to arrive in Baghdad from the US.
<p>The Senate report also makes clear that: 'The United States provided the government 
of Iraq with 'dual use' licensed materials which assisted in the development of 
Iraqi chemical, biological and missile-system programs.'
<p>This assistance, according to the report, included 'chemical warfare-agent 
precursors, chemical warfare-agent production facility plans and technical drawings, 
chemical warfare filling equipment, biological warfare-related materials, missile 
fabrication equipment and missile system guidance equipment'.
<p> Donald Riegle, then chairman of the committee, said: 'UN inspectors had identified 
many United States manufactured items that had been exported from the United States 
to Iraq under licenses issued by the Department of Commerce, and [established] 
that these items were used to further Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons development 
and its missile delivery system development programs.'
<p>Riegle added that, between January 1985 and August 1990, the 'executive branch 
of our government approved 771 different export licenses for sale of dual-use 
technology to Iraq. I think that is a devastating record'.
<p> It is thought the information contained in the Senate committee reports is 
likely to make up much of the 'evidence of proof' that Bush and Blair will reveal 
in the coming days to justify the US and Britain going to war with Iraq. It is 
unlikely, however, that the two leaders will admit it was the Western powers that 
armed Saddam with these weapons of mass destruction.
<p>However, Bush and Blair will also have to prove that Saddam still has chemical, 
biological and nuclear capabilities. This looks like a difficult case to clinch 
in view of the fact that Scott Ritter, the UN's former chief weapons inspector 
in Iraq, says the United Nations destroyed most of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 
and doubts that Saddam could have rebuilt his stocks by now.
<p>According to Ritter, between 90% and 95% of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 
were des troyed by the UN. He believes the remainder were probably used or destroyed 
during 'the ravages of the Gulf War'.
<p> Ritter has described himself as a 'card-carrying Republican' who voted for 
George W Bush. Nevertheless, he has called the president a 'liar' over his claims 
that Saddam Hussein is a threat to America.
<p> Ritter has also alleged that the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons 
emits certain gases, which would have been detected by satellite. 'We have seen 
none of this,' he insists. 'If Iraq was producing weapons today, we would have 
definitive proof.'
<p>He also dismisses claims that Iraq may have a nuclear weapons capacity or be 
on the verge of attaining one, saying that gamma-particle atomic radiation from 
the radioactive materials in the warheads would also have been detected by western 
surveillance.
<p>The UN's former co-ordinator in Iraq and former UN under-secretary general, 
Count Hans von Sponeck, has also told the Sunday Herald that he believes the West 
is lying about Iraq's weapons program.
<p>Von Sponeck visited the Al-Dora and Faluja factories near Baghdad in 1999 after 
they were 'comprehensively trashed' on the orders of UN inspectors, on the grounds 
that they were suspected of being chemical weapons plants. He returned to the 
site late in July this year, with a German TV crew, and said both plants were 
still wrecked.
<p>'We filmed the evidence of the dishonesty of the claims that they were producing 
chemical and biological weapons,' von Sponeck has told the Sunday Herald. 'They 
are indeed in the same destroyed state which we witnessed in 1999. There was no 
trace of any resumed activity at all.'</p>
