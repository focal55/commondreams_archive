<p>Oil is emerging as the key factor in US attempts to secure the support of Russia 
and France for military action against Iraq, according to an Observer investigation. 
<P>The Bush administration, intimately entwined with the global oil industry, 
is keen to pounce on Iraq's massive untapped reserves, the second biggest in the 
world after Saudi Arabia's. But France and Russia, who hold a power of veto on 
the UN Security Council, have billion-dollar contracts with Baghdad, which they 
fear will disappear in 'an oil grab by Washington', if America installs a successor 
to Saddam. 
<P>A Russian official at the United Nations in New York told the Observer last 
week that the $7 billion in Soviet-era debt was not the main 'economic interest' 
in Iraq about which the Kremlin is voicing its concerns. The main fear was a post-Saddam 
government would not honor extraction contracts Moscow has signed with Iraq. 
<P>Russian business has long-standing interests in Iraq. Lukoil, the biggest oil 
company in Russia, signed a $20bn contract in 1997 to drill the West Qurna oilfield. 
Such a deal could evaporate along with the Saddam regime, together with a more 
recent contract with Russian giant Zarubezhneft, which was granted a potential 
$90bn concession to develop the bin Umar oilfield. The total value of Saddam's 
foreign contract awards could reach $1.1 trillion, according to the International 
Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2001. 
<P>The Russian official said his government believed the US had brokered a deal 
with the coalition of Iraqi opposition forces it backs whereby support against 
Saddam is conditional on their declaring - on taking power - all oil contracts 
conceded under his rule to be null and void. 
<P>'The concern of my government,' said the official, 'is that the concessions 
agreed between Baghdad and numerous enterprises will be reneged upon, and that 
US companies will enter to take the greatest share of those existing contracts... 
Yes, if you could say it that way - an oil grab by Washington'. 
<P>A government insider in Paris told The Observer that France also feared suffering 
economically from US oil ambitions at the end of a war. But the dilemma for Paris 
is more complex. Despite President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Gerhard Schr&#246;der 
of Germany agreeing last week to oppose changing the rules governing weapons inspectors, 
France may back military action. 
<P>Government sources say they fear - existing concessions aside - France could 
be cut out of the spoils if it did not support the war and show a significant 
military presence. If it comes to war, France is determined to be allotted a more 
prestigious role in the fighting than in the 1991 Gulf war, when its main role 
was to occupy lightly defended ground. Negotiations have been going on between 
the state-owned TotalFinaElf company and the US about redistribution of oil regions 
between the world's major companies. 
<P>Washington's predatory interest in Iraqi oil is clear, whatever its political 
protestations about its motives for war. The US National Energy Policy Report 
of 2001 - known as the 'Cheney Report' after its author Vice President Dick Cheney, 
formerly one of America's richest and most powerful oil industry magnates - demanded 
a priority on easing US access to Persian Gulf supplies. 
<P>Doubts about Saudi Arabia - even before 11 September, and even more so in its 
wake - led US strategists to seek a backup supply in the region. America needs 
20 million barrels of crude a day, and analysts have singled out the country that 
could meet up to half that requirement: Iraq. 
<P>The current high price of oil is dragging the US economy further into recession. 
US control of the Iraqi reserves, perhaps the biggest unmapped reservoir in the 
world, would break Saudi Arabia's hold on the oil-pricing cartel Opec, and dictate 
prices for the next century. 
<P>This could spell disaster for Russian oil giants, keen to expand their sales 
to the West. Russia has sought to prolong negotiations, official statements going 
between opposition to any new UN resolution and possible support for military 
action against an Iraqi regime proven to be developing weapons of mass destruction. 
<P>While France is thought likely to support US military action, and China will 
probably fall in line because of its admission to the World Trade Organization, 
Putin is left holding the wild cards. 
<P>Russia recognizes potential benefits of reaching a deal with the US: Saddam's 
regime is difficult to work with. Lukoil's billion-dollar concessions are frozen 
and profitless to Moscow and Baghdad under UN sanctions, leading to fears that 
Saddam might have declared the agreement null and void out of spite. Iraqi diplomats 
say Zarubezhneft won its $90bn contract only after Baghdad took it away from TotalFinaElf 
because of French support for sanctions. 
<P>Russia stands to profit if intervention in the Gulf triggers a hike in Middle 
East oil prices, as its firms are lobbying to sell millions of barrels a day to 
the US, at two-thirds of the current market price. 
<P>Moscow's trust of Washington may be slipping after what a Russian UN official 
calls 'broken promises' that followed negotiations over Moscow's support for the 
Afghan campaign. 
<P>Russia turned a blind eye to US troops in central Asia, on the tacit condition 
that US-Russian trade restrictions would be lifted. But they are still there, 
and other benefits expected after 11 September have also not materialized.
<P>'They've been making this point very strongly,' a senior Bush administration 
official conceded to the Washington Post , 'that this can't be an all-give-and-no-get 
relationship... They do have a point that the growing relationship has got to 
be reciprocal.'</p>
