<p>Western chemical warfare experts said yesterday that the gas pumped into the 
theatre, which may have killed many of the hostages, was most likely a rare form 
of nerve agent developed by US military in the 1970s. 
<P>QND, or quinuclinodylbenzoate, developed by the Department of Defense, is a 
relative of a nerve agent and considered to be non-lethal when used properly. 
Russian officials refuse to name the gas. 
<P>"All nerve agents, like Sarin gas and those that the Iraqis use, block the 
transmissions between nerve and muscle", said Professor Peter Rose of the Open 
University. "These would produce the memory deficits that hostages have talked 
about."

Lev Fedorov, an independent chemist and environmental activist, looks on while 
speaking to the media, Moscow, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2002. Fedorov alleged Sunday that 
the medical and rescue services were poorly prepared for the evacuation of the 
hostages, and that increased the number of dead. Top Russian doctors said Sunday 
that they learned just a few minutes before starting to evacuate freed hostages 
that special forces had used knockout gas to incapacitate the terrorists who had 
seized a Moscow theaterand that the doctors still did not know the name of the 
compound used. (AP Photo/ Alexander Merkushev) <br>

</table></font>The symptoms usually caused by QND match those of hostages carried out of the 
building. It causes skin to be drained of color, sweating, victims to appear concussed, 
and possibly have respiratory problems. Victims can also experience hallucinations 
and anxiety attacks. 
<P>"QND is a muscarnic cholinergic blocker," said Prof Rose. "It effects a special 
type of nerve, known as a muscarnic receptor, in the brain. When it is released 
into the atmosphere, it gets into the lungs. It then passes through the bloodstream 
and through the entire brain." 
<P>Prof Rose said the agent affected the chemical acetylcholine, which carries 
messages from one nerve cell to another. "QND interacts with this and stops the 
message getting across," he added. "It's like turning the volume up on a radio 
and stopping any changes in the signal, so the message loses all its meaning. 
It would be like getting a constant 'long' signal in Morse code." 
<P>The agent works on the brain and paralyses its ability to interpret what is 
going on. "It turns off the lights, and destroys the body's headquarters." 
<P>Prof Rose added that the people least likely to be affected by the gas were 
the terrorists themselves as they are the healthiest and the most prepared for 
such a situation. "It will affect the young and the old more than the fit", he 
said. There were many young women among those carried from the theatre. 
<P>The gas has never been used before, Prof Rose said, except perhaps in secret, 
or in a US propaganda film in the 1970s, by the US Department of Defense"It was 
stockpiled and never used in the west." Prof Rose said he had experimented with 
the gas - which originally comes as a white powder mixed with a propellant - in 
a laboratory, but never on humans. 
<P>"It is bound to be lethal in high concentrations," said Prof Rose. "It would 
shut down the brain and if this happens for long enough the body stops getting 
oxygen and the brain itself dies." 
<P>The Russian military have considered using such "non-lethal incapacitants" 
before, said Lev Feodorov, the President of the Union of Chemical Security, to 
stop the coup attempt of 1993. Yet they decided against it. He added that the 
gas could have been made in Russia, but using an American formula that is commercially 
available. 
<P>Other analysts suggested the gas could be based on a substance called BZ, or 
another valium-based substance. Both could result in similar symptoms. Russian 
doctors complained on Saturday morning that they were not immediately told what 
the gas was, and could not properly treat inhalation victims. Relatives feared 
doctors still did not know the name of the gas yesterday, as the Russian authorities 
feared releasing the information to the public.</p>
