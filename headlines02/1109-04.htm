photographs of shackled and hooded terror prisoners from Afghanistan, apparently 
taken as a souvenir by a U.S. soldier, were mysteriously made public yesterday 
and brought renewed allegations of human-rights violations against the United 
States for treatment of captives in its war on terror.
<P>The photographs show the prisoners, possibly Taliban or al-Qaeda fighters, 
shackled, arms bound, wearing black cloth hoods and seated inside a C-130 cargo 
plane decorated with a large American flag. <a href="http://artbell.com/letters88.html" target="_new">The 
pictures</a> were sent by anonymous e-mail to the Web site of U.S. radio talk-show 
host Art Bell.</P>
<P>The Pentagon said the pictures had not been authorized and it was investigating 
how they became public. The photos are the first to show the methods used for 
transferring prisoners around Afghanistan and to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba.</P>
<P>They earned immediate condemnation from human-rights organizations while military 
experts said the measures taken by the U.S. soldiers appeared excessive.</P>
<P>Prisoners must of course be searched and disarmed, said Michel Drapeau, a retired 
colonel in the Canadian army. &#34;While in closed custody you want to make sure 
that the enemy is restrained to the degree required to ensure both his safety 
and the safety of his captors, and to prevent his escape or his capacity to inflict 
harm or injury on anyone,&#34; he said.</P>
<P>But the photos show steps taken to intimidate and humiliate the prisoners, 
he said, and the contrast between the heavily armed soldiers and their cowed and 
scruffy charges looks like overkill. &#34;Even people very, very sympathetic to 
the U.S. such as myself would say, &#39;Come on. Where could they possibly go?' 
&#34;</P>
<P>Neither the United States nor Canada would want to see its citizens treated 
in this manner by a foreign government, he said, even if detained on criminal 
charges. The U.S. Defense Department has prohibited news media from photographing 
any part of the prisoner transfer operation and severely limited media access 
to the detention center in Guantanamo Bay.</P>
<P>&#34;We have very, very tight restrictions on any images of the detainees for 
security purposes and because we have no interest in potentially holding detainees 
up for any kind of public ridicule,&#34; Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke 
told a press conference yesterday.</P>
<P>But that explanation did not carry much weight with human-rights groups.</P>
<P>&#34;We have all along raised concerns that when individuals are being detained 
and transferred, in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo, that they be treated in accordance 
with international standards, which among other things prohibit torture and ill-treatment,&#34; 
said Alex Neve of Amnesty International Canada. Sensory deprivation, including 
extended periods under a hood, is considered ill treatment and possibly even as 
a form of torture, he said.</P>
<P>Meanwhile yesterday, U.S. officials said that one of five men killed in a CIA 
hit on al-Qaeda suspects in Yemen Sunday was a U.S. citizen named Ahmed Hijazi 
linked to members of the alleged al-Qaeda cell in suburban Buffalo. Authorities 
had said two members of the cell remained at large.</p> </P>
