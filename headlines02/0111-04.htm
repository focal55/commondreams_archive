WASHINGTON - For half a century, a small but growing minority of Americans have 
viewed the world warily and thought - if not said - "Can we maybe just stay home?" 
<P>In recent years, signs seemed to mount of America's isolationist tendencies. 
But in the wake of Sept. 11, Americans' support for engagement in the world is 
surging. Favorable views of US involvement in the world are hitting levels not 
seen since World War II.</P>
<P>This doesn't mean Americans are eager to send troops to every country with 
an internal conflict or a terrorist in a cave. Reticence from the Vietnam era 
remains.</P>
<P>But it does mean that many now believe the world's only superpower should help 
to resolve problems like the Mideast conflict, and should use its power to do 
things like promote democracy and reduce poverty worldwide - not just as military 
might.</P>
<P>The attitude shift could lead to a change in how much the US spends abroad, 
and put pressure on the Bush administration - which shows signs of heeding the 
call - to be more interventionist beyond the war on terrorism.</P>
<P>Certainly, much of America's new interest in looking outward can be attributed 
to support for the war on terrorism. Similar (though less impressive) blips in 
support for engagement occurred after the Gulf War, as well as after the Iranian 
hostage crisis in 1980.</P>
<P>But the percentages of Americans who support US involvement in the world and 
efforts to forge a better view of the US are also at new highs - in some cases 
even higher than President Bush's ratings. People want a safer world - and they 
see making it a better place to live as one way to accomplish that.</P>
<P>"We've had this more or less sizable minority that has been attracted to the 
idea of shutting the world out, but this [Sept. 11] experience has told them, 
'No, you can't go home any more,' " says Steven Kull, director of the Program 
on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) at the University of Maryland. "Now the 
feeling is that, if you aren't in the world, the world can still come and get 
you. So running away from it isn't an answer," he says. "That leaves people more 
supportive of internationalist action."</P>
<P>In a recent poll, PIPA found 81 percent of Americans prefer a US that takes 
an "active part" in world affairs, as opposed to 14 percent favoring "staying 
out." A comparison of results when similar questions have been asked in surveys 
since World War II shows the 81 percent marks a new high.</P>
<P>The image of an average American as either unconcerned about the rest of the 
world or as satisfied with an Uncle Sam who carries a big stick is strong even 
within the US, but Mr. Kull says neither image is accurate. What Americans want, 
he says, is a US that doesn't act on its own but works within multilateral contexts.</P>
<P><b>Public doesn't want a lone ranger </b></P>
<P>That view is also reflected in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center and 
the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which found that most Americans agree 
the US should "take into account the views of allies" instead of acting unilaterally. 
In a commentary on the poll, CFR's Kenneth Pollack said the results suggest "considerable 
freedom of action" for the Bush administration in its diplomatic activities. But 
he also sees a public "ready to accept that the US may have to make compromises 
on other policy issues to attain the support we need in the war on terrorism."</P>
<P>Some analysts conclude that the rise in support for international engagement 
reflects primarily the public's desire for security and faith in the US military's 
ability to deliver a safer world.</P>
<P>Kull concurs that national security has jumped to the forefront of concerns 
after Sept. 11, but he says the public still shows interest in such goals as reducing 
poverty and promoting democracy around the world - but now more than ever as a 
way of enhancing long-term global security. "It's not that Americans' values have 
changed," he says. "It's more that the focus is different."</P>
<P>For example, the PIPA poll found even higher support for building "good will" 
toward America through food and medical aid (86 percent) than the record high 
support for US engagement in general.</P>
<P>Sensing this support for international involvement, some lawmakers on Capitol 
Hill are calling on Mr. Bush to boost US spending on international affairs in 
his next budget. The leaders note that US spending for international affairs has 
fallen by about one-third since the mid-1980s. .</P>
<P>"The idea is that in addition to defense and national security, we need to 
enhance the other ways America engages the world," says Joe Sheffo, spokesman 
for Sen. Gordon Smith (R) of Oregon, who coauthored a letter to Bush in favor 
of higher international spending. In Oregon, he says, "There's a concentration 
of religious and human rights organizations - plus a private sector, especially 
a lot of high-tech companies - that all have a strong interest in international 
engagement."</P>
<P> <b>Skepticism about waste </b> </P>
<P>Proponents of more spending on international affairs acknowledge they face 
skepticism from a public that considers too much is spent inefficiently or lost 
to corrupt foreign officials. Liz Schrayer of US Global Leadership, a consortium 
of private firms and charities supporting a higher international-affairs budget, 
says the public has a misconception about what the government already spends.</P>
<P>"They typically think the US spends about 15 percent of the budget on foreign 
aid and other international issues, and they say 5 percent would be about right," 
she says. "The reality is that it's about 1 percent."</P>
