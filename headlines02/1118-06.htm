<p>On any given Wednesday night, specks of candlelight illuminate the square as 
people gather quietly, praying for peace.</P>
<P>For about a month, people from community churches have stood near the gazebo 
on Wednesday evenings from 5-6 p.m. holding a peaceful protest against the possibility 
of war between the United States and Iraq.</P>

On average, Pastor Carroll Meyer of Westminster Presbyterian Church said, about 
two dozen people congregate.</P> 
<P>"All of us are concerned about the issues that seem to be developing," Meyer 
said.</P>
<P>The demonstration is a far cry from anti-war demonstrations that flash across 
the evening news, the pastor said.</P>
<P>"This is a quiet kind of demonstration," he said. "We're not yelling in the 
streets. We're quietly talking about praying for peace."</P>
<P>Cindy Gooch joined the vigils because she's frustrated.</P>
<P>"Some of us don't know what else to do," Gooch said.</P>
<P>With the possibility of war with Iraq looming, participating in the demonstrations 
gives Gooch a sense of accomplishment.</P>
<P>"I have the feeling that I haven't just been sitting at home, bemoaning the 
fact," Gooch said.</P>
<P>As an avid churchgoer, Gooch said mixing her patriotism with spirituality was 
hard at first. But after meeting people at the demonstrations, it was easier to 
blend church and state.</P>
<P>Participants are from all spectrums of the rainbow, young and old, Gooch said.</P>
<P>"It's refreshing to be around younger patriotism," she said. "It shows a different 
point of view and activity."</P>
<P>One group of participants who are especially affected by the possibility of 
war include students at The College of Wooster who are from Mideast countries.</P>
<P>For about two years the group has been studying conflicts in the Middle East, 
Meyer said. With the conflicts escalating, the group decided to join the demonstrations.</P>
<P>"It is very personal for them," Meyer said. "Their sisters and brothers, their 
homeland. When we think about what's happening there, it's very personal and painful."</P>
<P>"We don't want our nation to go headlong into war by ourselves," Gooch said. 
"If there's a backing of other nations, that's another matter."</P>
<P>She said the United States needs to step back to look at the picture as a whole 
before drastic measures are taken.</P>
<P>"We need to give Iraq another chance," Gooch said. "before we do something 
horrible. Many innocent people, who Hussein has taken advantage of, are going 
to be killed."</P>
<P>The square demonstrations may be small, but Meyer and Gooch hope they send 
a mighty message.</P>
<P>"We know we're a small group of people in a very large community," Meyer said. 
"We need to constantly remind people that there are alternatives and that we need 
to work on those alternatives."</P>
<P>The right to hold demonstrations is one freedom this nation offers that Gooch 
said she's thankful for.</P>
<P>"I don't want to live any place else," she said. "This is the country I want 
to be in."</P>
