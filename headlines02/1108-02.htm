<p>WASHINGTON -- Few industries campaigned harder than pharmaceutical manufacturers 
to elect Republicans to the new Congress, and few industries are better positioned 
to reap the rewards of the election returns, analysts said Thursday.
<p>"The pharmaceutical industry may be at the front of the line of groups looking 
at the next two years as an opportunity to make a lot of progress on their issues," 
said Larry Makinson, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics 
in Washington.
<p>It is a long line, with some related industries -- insurance companies, HMOs 
and physicians -- crowded near the front, along with energy companies, financial 
services and much of the rest of corporate America's elite.
<p> Their wish lists have many items in common, notably less regulation and more 
tax incentives.
<p>For drug manufacturers, that translates to no price controls, no patent reform 
and laws that keep drugs that are sold at cut rates abroad from being resold in 
the U.S. at the lower prices.
<p>For insurance companies, it means tax credits to help the uninsured buy health 
coverage -- but no requirement that mental illnesses be covered like other diseases. 
HMOs want to put an end to efforts to make it easier for patients to sue their 
health plans, and physicians are seeking malpractice reform and higher Medicare 
payments.
<p>In every case, the new Republican-controlled Congress will make an industry's 
preferred outcome more likely.
<p>And while drug manufacturers and other health-care industries were quick to 
describe Tuesday's election results as proof that voters agree with them on key 
issues, "the real story here is money," said John Rother, director of policy and 
strategy at AARP, the 35-million-member seniors' lobby.
<p>Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, agreed 
that the pharmaceutical industry's election day successes said more about the 
effectiveness of its political spending than voters' views.
<p>"It was really the money they spent in the hinterlands helping candidates and 
the money they spent on advertising to soften the blow of the issues so the number 
of voters who would vote on these issues would go down," he said.
<p>As of June 30, drug and nutritional supplement manufacturers ranked ninth among 
more than 80 industry groups in direct contributions to congressional candidates 
and political parties, according to Federal Election Commission records compiled 
by the Center for Responsive Politics. At that time, 73% of its $18.1 million 
in contributions had gone to Republican candidates and party committees.
<p>But those numbers reflect only a portion of what the $400-billion-a-year industry 
spent to influence Tuesday's elections. When FEC records from the last four months 
become available, the industry's contribution total will surely go up.
<p>On top of that, drug manufacturers consistently rank among the top two industry 
groups in money spent to lobby Congress. With more than 400 registered lobbyists 
-- nearly one for each of the 535 members of Congress -- the pharmaceutical industry 
spent nearly $97 million in 2000, according to records filed with the Secretary 
of the Senate and compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
<p>The industry and its sponsored advocacy groups also spend tens of millions 
of dollars on print and television ads. In the months before Tuesday's elections, 
they used photographs of sick children and frail seniors to suggest that generic 
drugs would make them worse.
<p>While the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, would 
not reveal the size of its advertising budget, an industry official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said published reports citing ad expenditures of $30 
million a year were "not inaccurate."
<p>The United Seniors Assn., an advocacy group financed almost entirely by PhRMA, 
Pfizer Inc. and other drug companies, reportedly spent more than $12 million in 
the campaign's closing weeks to air radio and television ads that encouraged voters 
to support Republican candidates.
<p>All that spending appears to have paid off, analysts said.
<p>The industry's top political priority, for example, a Medicare prescription 
drug benefit run by private insurance companies rather than the government, is 
virtually "settled by the outcome of the elections," said Blendon. "That's what 
they spent their money to get."
<p>Drug manufacturers "won't win everything they want" from the Republican Congress, 
he added, "but the something that gets done will be relatively nonthreatening. 
They are direct beneficiaries of the outcome of the election."
<p>This year, most health-care legislation languished in stalemates between the 
Republican-majority House and the Democratic-controlled Senate. The House, for 
example, passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit that would be administered 
by private insurance companies; the Senate debated three versions of a drug benefit 
but did not pass any of them.
<p>Likewise, while the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill making it easier for 
generic drugs to get to market, the House did not consider it. Similar divisions 
stalled action on tax credits for the uninsured, expanded legal rights for HMO 
patients and a measure that would have prevented health insurance plans that cover 
treatment for mental illness from limiting that coverage.
<p>"The industry works with Republicans and Democrats," the industry official 
said. "But over the last three or four years, some Democrats said they were going 
to make prescription drugs the campaign issue."
<p>The industry's political efforts were needed to help the public see through 
"that demagoguery and rhetoric" and realize that the continued production of life-saving 
medicines -- not drug prices or the demonization of drug companies -- was the 
key issue, the official said.
<p>A survey conducted for PhRMA last week asked whether "politicians who are criticizing 
prescription drug companies are motivated primarily by a desire to gain political 
advantage or by a desire to lower drug prices."
<p>Of the 1,000 voters in the survey, 51% said drug-company criticism was mostly 
about politics, leading PhRMA President Alan F. Holmer to conclude that "voters 
do not want to jeopardize the miracle of life-saving innovation in modern medicines."
<p>Voters were not asked whether they thought drug prices were too high. </p>
