<p>One of the Republican party's most respected foreign policy gurus yesterday 
appealed for President Bush to halt his plans to invade Iraq, warning of "an Armageddon 
in the Middle East". 
<P>The outspoken remarks from Brent Scowcroft, who advised a string of Republican 
presidents, including Mr Bush's father, represented an embarrassment for the administration 
on a day it was attempting to rally British public support for an eventual war. 
<P>The US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, yesterday spelled out what 
she called the "very powerful moral case" for toppling Saddam Hussein. "We certainly 
do not have the luxury of doing nothing," she told BBC Radio 4's Today program. 
She said the Iraqi leader was "an evil man who, left to his own devices, will 
wreak havoc again on his own population, his neighbors and, if he gets weapons 
of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, all of us". 
<P>But while Ms Rice was making the case for a pre-emptive strike, the rumble 
of anxiety in the US was growing louder. A string of leading Republicans have 
expressed unease at the administration's determination to take on President Saddam, 
but the most damning critique of Mr Bush's plans to date came yesterday from Mr 
Scowcroft. 
<P>The retired general, who also advised Presidents Nixon and Ford, predicted 
that an attack on Iraq could lead to catastrophe. 
<P>"Israel would have to expect to be the first casualty, as in 1991 when Saddam 
sought to bring Israel into the Gulf conflict. This time, using weapons of mass 
destruction, he might succeed, provoking Israel to respond, perhaps with nuclear 
weapons, unleashing an Armageddon in the Middle East," Mr Scowcroft wrote in the 
Wall Street Journal. 
<P>The Israeli government has vowed it would not stand by in the face of attacks 
as it did in 1991, when Iraqi Scud missiles landed on Israeli cities. It claims 
it has Washington's backing for retaliation. 
<P>Mr Scowcroft is the elder statesman of the Republican foreign policy establishment, 
and his views are widely regarded as reflecting those of the first President Bush. 
The fierceness of his attack on current administration policy illustrates the 
gulf between the elder Bush and his son, who has surrounded himself with far more 
radical ideologues on domestic and foreign policy. 
<P>In yesterday's article, Mr Scowcroft argued that by alienating much of the 
Arab world, an assault on Baghdad, would halt much of the cooperation Washington 
is receiving in its current battle against the al-Qaida organization.
<P>"An attack on Iraq at this time would seriously jeopardize, if not destroy, 
the global counterterrorist campaign we have undertaken," Mr Scowcroft wrote. 
<P>Both the American and British governments are expected to time a public relations 
effort to rebuff the critics and build public support in the immediate run-up 
to an invasion. 
<P>Senior Whitehall figures say that crucial in that effort will be evidence that 
President Saddam is building up Iraq's chemical biological warfare capability 
and planning to develop nuclear weapons. 
<P>The US defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, confirmed yesterday that the Pentagon 
was considering a change in the status of a navy pilot shot down over Iraq 11 
years ago. He is currently classified as "missing in action". 
<P>There have been reports that Lieutenant-Commander Michael Speicher was still 
being held by Iraq. 
<P>If he was reclassified as a prisoner of war, it would represent an additional 
source of conflict between Washington and Baghdad.
