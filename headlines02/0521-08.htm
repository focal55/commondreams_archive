<p>Leading separatist Abdul Ghani Lone was gunned down in Indian-administered Kashmir, just as Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee landed in the disputed state at the start of a three-day visit.</p>
<p>Lone, an executive member of the main separatist alliance in Kashmir, the All Party Hurriyat Conference, was killed in Srinagar, the state summer capital, while attending a public function.</p>
<p>One of his personal security officers was also shot dead in the attack by the unidentified gunmen, and another was injured, they said.</p>

</font>Farooq Abdullah, Kashmir's chief minister, immediately blamed the killing on Pakistan.
<p>"We have heard that terrorists have shot Abdul Ghani Lone dead and the body has been taken home.</p>
<p>"Whoever wants a peaceful solution in Kashmir is killed by Pakistan," he said.</p>
<p>However, in Islamabad, the Pakistan government issued an angry condemnation of the "cold-blooded murder" of Lone, and pointed the finger of blame at India.</p>
<p>"The murder of Abdul Ghani Lone is yet another incident in the continuing reign of terror unleashed by the occupying forces in the Indian-held Kashmir for the last 12 years," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The occupying forces have been engaged in a brutal effort to crush the Kashmiri spirit through murder, violence and rape. They will never succeed in achieving their despicable design."</p>
<p>Vajpayee, who was told of the murder when he landed in Jammu, Kashmir's winter capital, said Lone's death would affect the peace process in Kashmir but not stop it.</p>
<p>"I condemn this incident. I offer my condolences to the family. It has affected the peace process but has not weakened it," he said. "We will still work towards peace."</p>
<p>Lone's driver, Abdul Rashid, said the separatist was shot at close range by at least two attackers.</p>
<p>"When the function was over he (Lone) was leaving the venue and going to the car, when a gunmen opened fire," he said.</p>
<p>"He fell to the ground, he was reciting the Koran. Then the gunman fired at him again at close range as he lay on the ground."</p>
<p>The assailants also threw a grenade which failed to explode, witnesses said.</p>
<p>As news of the death spread, crowds of mourners gathered at Lone's residence.</p>
<p>Lone, 70, was seen as a moderate separatist leader who wanted to initiate steps to hold dialogue with the Indian government to find a political solution to the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>He had been attending a function to mark the anniversary of the death of another separatist leader, Molvi Mohammed Farooq, who was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in 1990.</p>
<p>There had been speculation in the Indian media that Lone was considering taking part in elections in Kashmir, due to be held later this year, which many militant groups have already said they will boycott.</p>
<p>However, Lone denied he was ever in favor of participation in the poll.</p>
<p>The killing comes exactly a week after Islamic militants launched an attack on an army camp near Jammu, killing 35 people and triggering an escalation of tension between India and Pakistan, whom New Delhi accuses of supporting the rebels.</p>
<p>Kashmir has reverberated with the sound of heavy shelling for the past five days, with Pakistani and Indian troops exchanging heavy fire across the disputed territory, the body count going up daily.</p>
<p>Police said a soldier and three civilians, two of them children, were killed in the shelling on Tuesday, while six people were injured in two militant bomb blasts. About 35,000 people have been killed in Kashmir since Islamic militants launched their separatist drive in 1989.</p>
<p>Britain Tuesday warned that there was a real possibility of war between the nuclear rivals and said it would send its foreign minister, Jack Straw, to try and ease the tension. </p>
<p>Straw said in a statement: "The possibility of war between India and Pakistan is real and very disturbing.</p>
<p>"The international community is watching events with mounting concern. This is a crisis the world cannot ignore."</p>
<p>China -- a long-time ally of Pakistan -- also Tuesday joined the growing international chorus calling for restraint.</p>
<p>Defense Minister George Fernandes, who is accompanying Vajpayee on his Kashmir visit, earlier Tuesday told commanders in the western desert state of Rajasthan that a "strong reply" had to be given to Pakistan-backed terrorism, while the Indian navy, already on high alert, said it had stepped up security measures.</p>
<p>Share prices closed 3.0 percent lower Tuesday on the Bombay Stock Exchange on panic selling by investors due to escalating fears of war, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said selling was across-the-board as both traders and funds offloaded shares.</p>
<p>A dealer said selling had been aggravated by reports that the Indian army had started moving troops from the riot-hit cities of the western state of Gujarat to the border with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The troops had been brought into Gujarat in early March to stem rioting in Ahmedabad, where over 1,000 people have been killed in sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<p>A defense spokesman said the troop movement had "no link" with the current impasse with Pakistan.</p>
