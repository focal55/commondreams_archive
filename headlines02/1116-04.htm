<p> With just two days to go before the UN weapons inspectors arrive in Baghdad, 
George Bush's administration is still beating the war drum. On Thursday night, 
Donald Rumsfeld, the defense secretary, confidently predicted that, should a war 
erupt, the Iraqi army would soon surrender in the face of overwhelming US force. 
He noted that in the first Gulf war, when allied forces pushed Iraq out of Kuwait, 
ground combat had lasted only 100 hours. 
<P>"I can't say if the use of force would last five days or five weeks or five 
months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that," he said. "It 
won't be a world war three." 
<P>You have always got to hope for minimum loss of life in any war, but Mr Rumsfeld's 
prognosis about the speed of an Iraqi army collapse is ideologically driven and 
strategically ill-informed. 
<P>In the event of an invasion, US forces will face an army that has been thoroughly 
indoctrinated, with party commissars in every unit. In addition, a ruthless system 
of surveillance and constant purges mean that the officer corps has had to renounce 
political activity to survive. To quote President Saddam Hussein: "With our party 
methods, there is no chance for anyone who disagrees with us jumping into a couple 
of tanks and overthrowing the government. These methods have gone." 
<P>It is true that Iraqi resistance in the 1991 Gulf war was negligible. The troops 
that surrendered in their thousands to coalition forces were badly trained, poorly 
led and had often not been fed for days. The war was a one-sided affair, with 
the Iraqis overwhelmed by superior weapons, technology and air power. 
<P>However, it is often forgotten that the Iraqi leadership made no serious attempt 
to defend Kuwait City. The fortifications were half-hearted and badly planned. 
They were primarily designed for propaganda, to convince coalition forces that 
military liberation would be too costly. Despite the portrayal of a heroic resistance 
in the "mother of all battles", once the ground war began, President Saddam quickly 
withdrew most of the republican guard, redeploying them around Baghdad to guard 
his regime. Substandard and ill-prepared troops were left to face certain defeat. 
<P>After the Gulf war defeat, the Iraqi army was cut to less than half its original 
size. The idea was to create a smaller, more disciplined force, ideologically 
committed to defending the regime. For more than a decade Washington has looked 
to this army for regime change. Today, the US government still hopes a coup triggered 
by an invasion will save American troops the high cost of fighting through Baghdad's 
streets to reach the presidential palace. 
<P>Like Washington, President Saddam is also aware of the dangers the Iraqi armed 
forces pose to his continued rule. To counter this he has staffed the upper ranks 
with individuals tied to him by bonds of tribal loyalty or personal history. Like 
him, most officers are Sunni Arabs, the country's traditional ruling class. They 
are outnumbered by Shia Muslims and well aware of the resentment towards them. 
<P>In addition, members of President Saddam's tribe, the Albu-Nasir, and those 
hailing from his hometown, Tikrit, dominate the army and security services' command, 
benefiting from regime patronage and enforcing his rule. They are also more than 
aware of the anger that will be directed at them if he goes. Because of this, 
those hoping for a coup may be disappointed. The regime has created a "coalition 
of guilt" that underpins its continued rule with corruption and great fear about 
what will happen when it is finally toppled. 
<P><B>Sanctions</B>
<P>In contrast to 1991, the battle this time will be not for a foreign land but 
for the very survival of a regime many have spent their lives serving. An invading 
US army will face 375,000 Iraqi troops and 2,200 tanks. 
<P>Analysts are right to point out that the army as a whole has suffered greatly 
during more than a decade of sanctions. Beyond elite regiments, equipment is old 
and badly maintained. Estimates suggest that the army is only 50% combat effective, 
and regular troops may well behave as they did in 1991, fleeing the battlefield 
once war begins. On the other hand, President Saddam has surrounded himself with 
a robust security system spreading out in three concentric rings. The security 
services become more disciplined, motivated and reliable the closer they are to 
the president. 
<P>The republican guard makes up the first ring of the regime's security. Stationed 
on the three main roads to Baghdad, this parallel military force totals between 
50,000 and 70,000 men. 
<P>They are better paid than ordinary soldiers and much more likely to remain 
loyal. Many stood by their posts during the Gulf war, losing a third of their 
tanks. In the aftermath, they played the lead role in suppressing Shia and Kurdish 
revolts in the north and south of the country. 
<P>The next ring of security is the special republican guard, formed in the 1980s 
when the republican guard became too large to be totally trusted. Consisting of 
26,000 men, they are the only troops stationed in Baghdad. The loyalty of this 
force's officers is beyond doubt. About 80% of them come from the same region 
as President Saddam, and they have been used as the regime's main tool for policing 
Iraq. 
<P>Finally, surrounding President Saddam and the 50 or so people who rule Iraq 
are a myriad of competing security organizations. Each one is charged with overseeing 
the others, and they are headed by a small group of individuals who are keenly 
aware that their continued health and prosperity is dependent upon the rule of 
their boss. They too would fight to the last to defend him. 
<P>One of the main problems during the Iran-Iraq war was the army's inability 
to act on its own initiative. To counter this, Baghdad has reportedly decentralized 
its army command and control down to the lowest level possible. Responsibility 
for each urban center, from Basra in the south to Mosul in the north, has been 
delegated to a trusted high-ranking soldier. Each town has been garrisoned with 
troops, and stockpiles of weapons and food have been built up. 
<P>Should hostilities start, martial law would be declared and troops brought 
on to the streets. The ministry of information has developed a highly efficient 
press handling system. Once bombing begins, with its inevitable civilian casualties, 
the hope is that international press coverage will put pressure on Washington 
to stop the war prematurely, as it did in 1991. 
<P>Baghdad will be key. It is within this sprawling city of five million that 
US troops will have to hunt down the Iraqi dictator and his close associates. 
With this in mind, all troops and security services loyal to the government will 
in the last instance be massed in and around the capital. 
<P>Caught between a potentially hostile Iraqi population bent on revenge and an 
invading army committed to regime change, those fighting alongside President Saddam 
will have little choice but to remain loyal to the end. The result could be the 
worst-case scenario for US military planners: an organized, committed and disciplined 
force with nowhere to go, defending a highly populated urban area. In front of 
the world's media, US troops would have the unenviable task of distinguishing 
these forces from the wider, innocent, civilian population. 
<P>If Mr Bush orders US troops to invade Iraq to topple the regime, it will not 
only be the most important and risky decision of his presidency, but a momentous 
event in world politics. The only thing certain about it is that it will not be 
as simple as Mr Rumsfeld says.

of the Royal Institute of International Affairs.</i></p>
