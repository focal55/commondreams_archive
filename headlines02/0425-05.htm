BERKELEY -- 
A pro-Palestinian group that took over a building at the University of 
California at Berkeley this month has been suspended from campus under what 
officials called a crackdown on academic disruptions.
<P>Campus administrators have also told 41 students arrested when the group 
<a href="http://www.justiceinpalestine.org/" target="_new">Students for Justice in Palestine</a> occupied Wheeler Hall that they may be 
suspended for as long as a year.
<P>"We never had tolerated disruptions of the academy, but what has changed is 
that the sanctions have changed," Karen Kenney, director of student activities 
and services, said yesterday.
<P>Before, she said, "students didn't face some form of suspension for cite-
and-release arrests."
<P>The action means the group is barred from holding demonstrations on campus, 
having an information table or handing out leaflets while the university 
investigates the April 9 protest, during which 79 people were arrested.
<P>Hoang Phan, 25, one of those arrested, said the group had just been acting 
out the UC Berkeley tradition of civil disobedience.
<P>"We have a Free Speech Movement Cafe on campus. We have the Mario Savio 
steps," Phan said. "We were making clear our political message. Our event did 
not threaten anyone. There was no property destruction. We didn't lock it down 
-- the police locked down the building."
<P><b>ZERO WARNING</b>
<P>Students from the pro-Palestinian group said campus officials had declared 
the zero-tolerance policy right before their protest, and they concluded that 
it was aimed specifically at them. Kenney, however, said UC Berkeley officials 
had merely strengthened an existing policy after a series of disruptive 
incidents.
<P>Students for Justice in Palestine also took over Wheeler Hall last April to 
push for the university to divest its holdings in Israel, and campus 
administrators warned them they would face sanctions if they disrupted classes 
during their latest protest, Kenney said.
<P>The students who were arrested this month have been referred to the Student 
Conduct Office and will go through a disciplinary process. If the arrested 
students dispute the charges, a committee of students, faculty and 
administrators can hold a hearing and recommend sanctions to Kenney.
<P>Other groups have been suspended from campus for protests that disrupted 
classes, Kenney said. A pro-affirmative action organization, By Any Means 
Necessary, was suspended for several weeks last year after a rally turned into 
a near-riot.
<P>"It is standard procedure if a student group violates campus rules," 
Assistant Chancellor John Cummins said. "The takeover of an academic building 
is a serious violation."
<P><b>RALLY PLANNED FOR MAY</b>
<P>The university's action may not keep the group's members from staging more 
anti-Israel demonstrations. Some members of Students for Justice in Palestine 
have already signed up with the International Socialist Organization to hold 
another rally in early May.
<P>"In the end, the university can't stop us from exercising our freedom of 
speech because there are many more people on campus who feel the way we do," 
said William Youmans, 24, a law student and a member of Students for Justice 
in Palestine.
<P>The group, which has chapters on college campuses across the country, has 
held several protests at Berkeley over the past year, including one in which 
it erected a mock military checkpoint and herded students into "refugee camps."</p>
