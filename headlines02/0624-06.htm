<p> If Tony Blair is lucky when he arrives in Kananaskis, Alberta, next Tuesday 
night for the annual summit of leaders from the world's eight most powerful economies, 
he might see a grizzly bear, a bald eagle, a cougar or wolf. One thing he is unlikely 
to see is any anti-globalization protesters.

</table></font>After last year's disastrous G8 summit in Genoa, when a 20-year-old demonstrator 
was shot dead by security forces, leaders pledged to go back to basics for future 
meetings. 
<P>Instead of expensive jamborees in cities - an easy target for "summit hoppers" 
in the anti-globalization movement - the G8 decided to return to the original 
concept proposed by the French president Val&#233;ry Giscard d'Estaing: a "fireside 
chat" between world leaders, the first of which took place in 1975 at Rambouillet, 
near Paris. 
<P>This year's summit host, the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr&#233;tien, has 
chosen the most remote fireside he could think of. Kananaskis is two hours away 
from the nearest big city, Calgary, and will be virtually impossible for protesters 
to reach. 
<P>A security cordon 13 miles wide has been thrown around the resort village. 
The hikers who usually throng its mountain trails in the summer have been warned 
to avoid the area, which will be swarming with police. 
<P>In a typically Canadian touch, the security forces will be armed not only with 
the normal anti-terrorist weapons, but also poop-scoops to ensure that the forests 
of Alberta are left in pristine condition. 
<P><B>Security concerns</B><BR>
The September 11 attacks have given the police more to worry about than the clean 
up. At one stage, it was rumored that George Bush might stay across the border 
in Montana because the White House was not happy about security in Kananaskis. 
Now, reassured by Canada's preparations, he has decided to stay with the rest 
of the gang. In this jittery environment, the village's small complex of luxury 
hotels has to be one of the safest places to hide world leaders. 
<P>As part of the back to basics approach, the summit will be on a smaller scale 
than previous events. Last year, Mr Bush traveled with a retinue of 800 government 
officials. This year, the total number of officials attending will be just 200. 
Most of the thousands of journalists covering the summit will not be allowed through 
the security cordon - they will be in Calgary, 80 miles away, with briefings conducted 
by video-link. 
<P>The anti-globalization movement's response is also likely to be more low-key. 
City authorities in Calgary have denied activists permission to set up a protest 
camp downtown, so the movement has decided to try to disrupt the Canadian capital, 
Ottawa instead. Only the most determined protesters are expected to try to penetrate 
the leaders' mountain fastness. 
<P>Even without the geographical challenge posed by the summit's location, the 
movement was already facing some tactical difficulties. 
<P>Last year's protests in Genoa were the culmination of an increasingly violent 
series of clashes which have marred global summits since the Seattle meeting of 
the World Trade Organization in December 1999. 
<P>Violent clashes at the World Bank's annual meeting in Prague eight months later 
gave a warning that parts of the European anti-globalization movement were becoming 
increasingly hardline. 
<P>But on the other side of the Atlantic, September 11 has changed the nature 
of protests. Some of the biggest groups in the North American anti-globalization 
coalition - unions, debt relief advocates and mainstream aid lobbyists - have 
decided that mass street marches involving confrontation with the police are no 
longer appropriate. 
<P>However, the real test of the new-style summit will not be whether the police 
manage to keep everything except for the wildlife at bay. Mr Blair and Mr Chr&#233;tien 
both promised last year that Africa would top the agenda in Kananaskis - but as 
the leaders prepare to fly to Canada, the world's poorest continent appears to 
be at risk of being sidelined by talks on terrorism, security and the Middle East. 
<P><B>The cost of conferring</B><BR>
When Japan hosted the G8 two years ago, officials decided the summit was a grand 
excuse to pump some money into discontented Okinawa, whose citizens were angry 
about a US military base on the island. However, the bill of &#163;500m was large 
even by the lavish standards of previous G8 shindigs. 
<P>Last year's Genoa summit cost the Italian government &#163;100m, though the 
lion's share went on enhancing security, including the installation of a missile 
defense system at the airport. 
<P>Kananaskis is supposed to be a slimmed-down summit, but the contrast between 
the cost of staging it and the pitiful amounts that leaders are likely to deliver 
for the world's poor will raise more questions about the relevance of the G8. 
<P>This year, the Canadian government estimates that its arrangements for the 
two-day summit will cost around &#163;140m. The opposition says feeding and housing 
the leaders and officials will cost tens of millions more. 
<P>The estimated total is, ironically, the same amount as Canada has donated to 
the G8's so-called "Marshall Plan for Africa". 
<P>Canada is the only country to have made a firm pledge on the plan for Africa 
ahead of Kananaskis. 
<P>Hopes that the summit will deliver anything like the sums which the US gave 
Europe in the original Marshall Plan look certain to be disappointed.</p>
