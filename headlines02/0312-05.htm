MOSCOW — A leaked Pentagon document detailing the Bush administration's plans for future use of nuclear weapons may lay the groundwork for the most deadly arms race since the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.
<P></P>
"What's really new and important is that the U.S. is actually moving in the direction of using nuclear weapons in local conflicts, and developing a new generation of weapons not designed for use against Russia, or another major power, but for small "surgical" operations," said independent defence analyst Pavel Felgenhauer.
<P></P>
"Russia watches American military strategy very carefully," he added. "And copies it."
<P></P>
The secret Nuclear Posture Review was submitted to Congress in early January, but leaked to the media this week. It says the Pentagon must be prepared for a nuclear strike against Russia, China, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Iran and Libya, in situations not clearly defined.
<P></P>
It calls for development of small "battlefield" nuclear weapons to be used in localized conflicts, rather than deterrents of last resort. This abandons the "mutual assured destruction" (MAD) doctrine that kept the world's most dangerous weapons in check for half a century.
<P></P>
Under the new doctrine, the number of Russian targets would likely be reduced, given Moscow is not considered a current threat. That may explain why Russia's response was muted
<P></P>
"Russian bomb makers have also pursued the same programs, and they are arguing it's very important to continue with them," Felgenhauer said. "If the U.S. uses tactical weapons in Afghanistan, you'll see Russia using battlefield nukes in Chechnya."
<P></P>
The Chinese foreign ministry, on the other hand, yesterday demanded an explanation from Washington. Other states worried the U.S. plan could destabilize an uncertain world, Associated Press reports.
<P></P>
"China, like other countries, is deeply shocked," foreign ministry spokesperson Sun Yuxi told Xinhua news agency
<P></P>
Iran — called part of an "axis of evil" by U.S. President George W. Bush — said the report showed America would never observe international law on use of nuclear weapons, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
<P></P>
Other countries named were silent.
<P></P>
Babil, the newspaper owned by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Uday, reported on the U.S. move without comment..
<P></P>
Japan, the only country bombed by nuclear weapons, delivered by American pilots, said it opposes use of weapons of mass destruction but was otherwise tight-lipped,
<P></P>
German Foreign Ministry spokesperson Antje Leendertse said the government was satisfied with U.S. insistence that it does not plan to use nuclear weapons against any country.
<P></P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham urged Washington to use extreme caution but told reporters the U.S. was a long way from going down "a very dangerous slippery slope."
<P></P>
Australia's Defence Ministry played down the report yesterday as routine military planning, as did the British Foreign Office and the Italian minister of defence a day earlier.
<P></P>
If small nuclear weapons become part of Russia's arsenal for fighting local wars, said Felgenhauer, a former military officer, the added danger will be a lack of centralized control.
<P></P>
"They will be at the disposal of battlefield commanders, not under central command. From my knowledge of the General Staff, they expect their battlefield commanders to be in control of their weapons. Nuclear weapons would be handed out to them to use as they wish."
<P></P>
The possibility of developing deadly radioactive weaponry for use against unconventional enemies could change the nature of warfare.
<P></P>
"The (Pentagon's) call for development of new nuclear weapons that reduce `collateral damage' ignores the political, moral and military implications of crossing the nuclear threshold," says arms control expert William Arkin of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
<P></P>
The worry is that Russia, as well as the U.S., may be drawn into a new line-crossing philosophy that considers nuclear weapons a legitimate part of the "war against terrorism."
<P></P>
"In truth," said Arkin in the Los Angeles Times, "what has evolved since last year's terror attacks is an integrated, significantly expanded planning doctrine for nuclear wars."
