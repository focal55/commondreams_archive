<p>CARACAS, VENEZUELA – The problems for Venezuela's embattled President Hugo 
Chávez just keep getting worse. </P>
<p>Chastened by a coup in April in which he was ousted from power for 48 hours, 
Mr. Chávez vowed to improve relations with groups that had initiated his overthrow, 
including the military, business leaders, and much of the public.</P>
<P>But Ch&#225;vez's opponents are as determined as ever to see him removed from 
office.</P>
<P>On Saturday, tens of thousands took to the streets of Caracas and continued 
calls for his resignation. The protests were peaceful, in contrast to the April 
11 march preceding the coup, in which 18 people were killed the first day. Dozens 
more were killed and hundreds more were injured in the following days.</P>
<P>Now Ch&#225;vez is facing another potential showdown. A second coup, possibly 
much bloodier than the first, is likely between now and July 5, according to experts 
here and military officers.</P>
<P>"We are in an irreversible situation," says political analyst Alberto Garrido, 
and author of a number of books on Ch&#225;vez's political movement. "There is 
no buffer between the two sides."</P>
<P>E-mails circulated last week saying that the overthrow of Ch&#225;vez was likely. 
And 10 masked figures claiming to be military officers appeared on television 
condemning the government's behavior. Ch&#225;vez dismissed the rumors as opposition-led 
propaganda.</P>
<P>Four junior officers who say they are part of a fresh coup plot agreed to talk 
with the Monitor on condition of anonymity. Three wore masks and camouflage fatigues, 
while the fourth &#150; a national guard lieutenant &#150; agreed to appear with 
his face uncovered.</P>
<P>"We want to put a stop to an unsustainable situation," says an Army captain. 
"If nothing changes, we're heading for civil war."</P>
<P>Claiming to represent as much as 70 percent of the armed forces, the officers 
cited specifically military grievances, as well as their rejection of what they 
call the government's "communist tendencies." They produced a payslip showing 
that an ordinary member of the national guard earns as little as $150 per month 
after deductions.</P>
<P>The armed forces, they claim, are being deliberately starved of resources while 
money is diverted to bolster so-called "Bolivarian circles." These civilian groups 
are seen by the Venezuelan opposition as partly a cover for the creation of militias.</P>
<P>Sources close to pro-Ch&#225;vez hardliners confirm that automatic weapons 
have been distributed to civilian groups and that "some hotheads" would use them 
in the event of a coup. The military dissidents have threatened to kill any who 
represent a threat to lives or property.</P>
<P>"We are prepared for anything," the Army captain says. He warned of a "river 
of blood" if there were resistance by pro-Ch&#225;vez forces, adding that there 
were "fanatical military units too" that were willing to die for the government.</P>
<P>Ch&#225;vez still has some support among the public. Thousands of pro-Ch&#225;vez 
supporters gathered in cities around Caracas, waving placards and donning red 
berets, the signature of the former paratrooper-cum-president.</P>
<P>July 5 is seen as a key date because that is the when the annual round of military 
promotions is announced. After that, many dissident officers will have been removed 
from their posts and several hundred could be expelled from the armed forces.</P>
<P>If successful, the dissident officers said, the leaders of their movement planned 
to install a seven to nine-member military-civilian junta and call elections as 
soon as possible.</P>
<P>Even if the coup is unsuccessful, Ch&#225;vez may also face pressure of impeachment 
on human rights violations and for financial irregularities. Opponents say that 
he authorized the police to fire on civilians during the April coup, and that 
his administration is responsible for $2.3 billion in missing oil revenue.</P>
<P>Ch&#225;vez, a former army lieutenant-colonel, staged a failed coup himself 
in 1992, but was democratically elected in 1998. Since taking power he has reformed 
the Constitution to increase his hold on power and to bring more of the economy, 
which is now foundering, under the control of the state.</P>
<P>Ch&#225;vez has earned the disapproval of the United States, which receives 
up to 15 percent of its oil from Venezuela. Suspicious of his links with guerrillas 
in neighboring Colombia and Fidel Castro's Cuba, Washington all but welcomed the 
April coup.</P>
