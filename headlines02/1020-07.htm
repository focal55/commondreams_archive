<p>Once, the streets of Cleveland and cities across the country echoed with cries 
of "Peace now!" shouted by marchers bearing such signs as "Stop the bombing" and 
"Bring the troops home." Far from the haze of gunsmoke and napalm, the scent of 
burning draft cards and civil disobedience drifted in the air. </P>
<P> Thirty years ago, as the war in Vietnam raged, all they were saying was give 
peace a chance. </P>
<P> Today, the possibility of war with Iraq has prompted plans for mass protest 
marches and rallies Saturday in Washington and San Francisco, and in a case of 
dissent deja vu, the old sentiments and slogans are surfacing again. </P>
<P> As they should, according to local veteran activists who are gearing up once 
more for action on some familiar turf. The long hair may be graying or gone, but 
the fire in the belly still burns. </P>
<P> It burns in Katie Baird of Mantua, who chaired the anti-war Cleveland Area 
Peace-Action Council from 1970 to 1972. </P>
<P> "This [possible war with Iraq] looks so much like Vietnam, it's scary," she 
said. "I get the same sense of foreboding. It's time to get back to the streets 
again." </P>
<P> During the late 1960s and early '70s, Cleveland provided several leaders for 
the national anti-war movement. </P>
<P> Those leaders included Dr. Benjamin Spock, the famed baby doctor and a professor 
at Western Reserve University; fellow WRU faculty member Sidney Peck, who co-chaired 
the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam; and Jerry Gordon. 
</P>
<P> Gordon is coordinator of the National Peace Action Coalition. </P>
<P> Gordon, now the 73-year-old chairman of the Ohio Labor Party, is organizing 
trade-union opposition to an Iraqi war, as part of what he expects will be a broader 
cross section of dissenting Americans than was seen during the Vietnam era. </P>
<P> Back then, students formed the bulk of peace demonstrators, according to Gordon. 
This time, economics will bring others into the fold, he said. </P>
<P> "The government is telling us it has no money for prescription drugs for seniors, 
or jobs, or education, but along comes a war and suddenly it has money galore," 
Gordon said. "During Vietnam, [President] Johnson talked about guns and butter. 
Here, it's guns or butter, and workers are upset." </P>
<P> To Baird, the lessons of Vietnam laid the groundwork for contemporary dissent. 
"Before I joined the anti-war movement, I was raised on Reader's Digest and the 
Bible, when no one would ever think the government would lie to us," she said. 
"Those days are gone forever." </P>
<P> Baird hopes to join Saturday's protest march in Washington, sponsored by the 
International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) campaign and coordinated 
locally through such groups as the People's Fightback Center, formed during America's 
first war with Iraq in 1991. </P>
<P> Fightback organizer Martha Grevatt, 45, of Cleveland, remembers when her parents 
took her to protest rallies during the Vietnam War; their generation is back in 
the fray again, she said. </P>
<P> "We're getting a lot of people who really haven't been active since the Vietnam 
protest feeling compelled to get back on the streets, plus a whole new generation 
of first-protest activists," she said. </P>
<P> But those marching on Washington next weekend won't include veteran peace 
campaigner Katherine Marshall, of Rocky River. At 84, "I'm going to have to sit 
this one out," said Marshall, who was executive secretary of the University Circle 
Teach-in Committee that hosted national peace-protest planning conferences during 
the 1960s. </P>
<P> She will, however, lobby federal legislators by mail and phone, joining similar 
efforts being conducted by Cleveland Peace Action - a former anti-nuclear war 
group that nearly died with the end of the Cold War but found new life in the 
first Gulf War. </P>
<P> Francis Chiappa, president, said many of the group's 250 members are longtime 
activists, some going back to the anti-Communist hysteria of McCarthyism in the 
1940s and '50s. </P>
<P> Chiappa, 52, of Cleveland Heights, said protest of a possible war with Iraq 
differs from the Vietnam era in that "this time we have a group of activists willing 
to stand up for peace before the bullets start flying." </P>
<P> Former Vietnam War protester Bob Charlick, a Cleveland Peace Action board 
member and professor of political science at Cleveland State University, expects 
that opposition to war with Iraq will continue building and intensify if the conflict 
"turns out to be a long and bloody process." </P>
<P> Charlick, 60, of Cleveland Heights, said that although the protest movement 
will probably always represent a minority of Americans, "it's important to some 
of us who were active during the Vietnam War that our children and grandchildren 
know we're not giving up on the idea that this country can have a better foreign 
policy than this one and do not approve of attacking without provocation. </P>
<P> "As to [protesters] stopping the war, it's seriously doubtful," he added. 
"But we can raise the level of public debate, and it could become an issue in 
congressional races and maybe even the next presidential election." </P>
<P> Local peace activists don't expect an easy campaign. </P>
<P> "I remember early in the Vietnam protest when people spit at us," Baird said. 
"But eventually the anti-war sentiment became so widespread that it did, in fact, 
help end the war. It always starts small, but if you're right, it gets bigger. 
</P>
<P> "And maybe that's what we have to do now." </p>
