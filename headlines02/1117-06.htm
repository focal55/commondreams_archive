<p>FORT BENNING, Ga. - Several thousand people gathered outside the gates of this 
military base on Sunday to protest a U.S. Army school whose graduates they claim 
are responsible for human rights abuses in Latin America.

Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, for the human rights abuses.

</table></font>Carrying signs that said "Stop Training Terrorists" and  "Protect Human Rights," activists of various ages and religious  backgrounds took part in a peaceful demonstration calling for  the closing of the facility formerly known as the School of the  Americas.
<p> The facility has been constantly criticized by the <a href="http://www.soaw.org" target="_new">School 
of Americas Watch</a> group, which has held yearly protests at Fort Benning since 
1990. Local police said 8,000 attended, while protest organizers estimated a crowd 
of 11,000.
<p>

		At least 96 people were detained by Fort Benning  authorities when they crossed over the main gate and entered  the base. The organization said about 100 people have served  prison sentences for trespassing since its protests began.<p>

		Though U.S. defense officials formally closed the School of  the Americas in 2000 and reopened it a year later under a new  name, critics say the school is a tarnished symbol of violence.<p>

		The organization says the school's 60,000 graduates include  dictators Manuel Noriega of Panama and Leopoldo Galtieri of  Argentina.<p>

		Though the protest has become an annual event in Columbus,  Georgia, which is located about 110 miles southwest of Atlanta,  organization founder Rev. Roy Bourgeois said a heightened U.S.  focus on terrorism and talk about a possible U.S.-led war  against Iraq gave his peace movement a new urgency.<p>

</table></font>"People are looking for hope," Bourgeois told Reuters. "Our  president keeps saying we have to go after terrorist training  camps and shut them down. We are here to say that a good place  to start is right in our back yard."<p>

		Bourgeois said graduates of the school have been directly  linked to deaths of hundreds of thousands of Latin American  civilians. Though the school is now called the Western  Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, Bourgeois said  the name change was purely cosmetic.<p>

		But George Bruno, international affairs adviser at the  institute, said the new school focuses on causes such as  antiterrorism and disaster relief, while its predecessor  addressed outdated Cold War issues. He said the institute's 900  students include military and civilian personnel from 25  countries.<p>

		"This demonstration typifies the values we are trying to  instill in the students that come to the institute-respect for  civilian authority, for human rights and democracy," Bruno  said.<p>

		Some at the protest were repeat visitors. Pat Carney, who  lives in Los Angeles, said he has attended the protests for six  years to remember his brother James, a Jesuit priest whom he  says was killed by Honduran military personnel in 1983.
<p> Carney said his brother was a peace activist who helped Honduran peasants 
improve their lives. "We've been fighting for what he stood for ever since his 
death," he said.
