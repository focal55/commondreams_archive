<p>YECAPIXTLA, Mexico  - Cirilo Yanez has been  farming sorghum in the sleepy Mexican town of Yecapixtla his  whole life, but he expects to be forced out of the business  after a new phase of the North American Free Trade Agreement  comes into effect on Jan. 1.<p>

		"As long as I've been alive, I have been in sorghum, as  were my parents and as are my children," said the weathered  Yanez, 62, who farms seven acres of the grain in central  Morelos state and sells it as livestock feed.<p>

Mexican farmers ride their horses onto the grounds of the Mexican lower house, or Chamber of Deputies, December 10, 2002 at Mexico City's San Lazaro legislative palace to protest the January 1 opening of borders to zero-tariff trade on most farm goods.

</table></font>On the first day of 2003, protective tariffs on imports of  sorghum and most other farm goods will disappear under NAFTA  and cheaper U.S. imports are expected to flood into Mexico and  dominate market share.<p>

		Yanez says that even now, with protective tariffs on  imports, he and other Mexican producers cannot compete with  cheaper U.S.-produced sorghum, which is used in snack and baked  products, to produce ethanol and as animal feed.<p>

		Mexican farmers, many of whom till small plots with donkeys  and follow ancient traditions such as sowing seeds barefoot,  cannot compete with U.S. machinery or infrastructure and,  ultimately, in price.<p>

		In January, import tariffs on apples, wheat, sorghum, rice,  soy and many other farm products will drop to zero, from  between 1 percent and 2 percent now, in the second phase of  trade liberalization between NAFTA members Canada, Mexico and  the United States.<p>

		Chicken and pork imports will see tariffs lowered more  drastically, from as high as 49 percent in the case of poultry.<p>

		Four other products, including powdered milk, corn and  beans will get five more years of protection before tariffs go  to zero in 2008.<p>

		DEATH SENTENCE?<p>

		Producers see a death sentence in the agricultural chapters  of NAFTA, signed a decade ago and implemented since 1994, and  blame the Mexican government for not preparing them for free  trade.<p>

		"The governments of the recent past and of the present have  refused to assume the commitment of rural development; they  have refused to assume the responsibility of promoting  agricultural activities, as it has been much more comfortable  for them to be simple spectators," legislators said in a recent  document sent to Mexican President Vicente Fox as part of a  petition for more protection of the agriculture sector.<p>

		"The countryside is being abandoned," said Sergio Ramirez,  a sorghum farmer from Yecapixtla, a tiny farming pueblo some 50  miles south of Mexico City. He said he believes he will soon be  yet another casualty of NAFTA.<p>

		Ramirez said more and more sorghum farmers have abandoned  their lands in the area since Mexico entered NAFTA because they  could not compete with their U.S. counterparts, blessed with  economies of scale most Mexican farmers can only dream about.<p>

		The average farm size per Mexican farmer is between five  and seven acres, whereas U.S. and Canadian farmers' properties  are normally over 250 acres each.<p>

		Critics say that, other than some fantastic success stories  in fruits and vegetables, the Mexican farm sector is unable to  compete virtually across the board.<p>

		"The Mexican countryside is becoming deserted. Many have  gone already," Yanez said. He said disillusioned farmers  usually make their way into Mexico City where they do bit jobs,  or cross illegally into the United States to find work.<p>

		The government says it will not attempt to renegotiate  NAFTA, but it has announced subsidies to protect some farmers.<p>

		In November the government announced about $3 billion in  agricultural subsidies meant to lower costs and guarantee  minimum prices for Mexican farmers in some products amid  heightened competition from U.S. farm goods.<p>

		The subsidies were part of a record 102.6 billion pesos  ($10.09 billion) in farm aid for 2003 to support electricity  and diesel fuel costs and to offer competitive financing to the  struggling agricultural sector.<p>

		That compares to some $190 billion in U.S. farm subsidies  over the next 10 years.<p>

		The measures have been criticized by many who say the aid  is not enough and who speculate it will likely get siphoned off  in bureaucratic expenses and by sticky-fingered officials.<p>

		Some farmers say the aid will never get to the small  campesino producers and that it is destined in fact for the  large farmers who did manage to boost production efficiency  during NAFTA's nascent years.<p>

		Mexican farmers are suffering what the rest of the  developing world has been screaming about, their inability to  compete with U.S. and European farm subsidies.<p>

		MEXICO ILL PREPARED<p>

		Tariffs have been lowered gradually since 1994, when the  treaty went into effect for Mexico, and many question why  Mexican farmers are not prepared, and why they are making such  a fuss, if they had eight years to prepare for the 2003  opening.<p>

		Still others say not much will change on Jan. 1.<p>

		A top U.S. agriculture official said in late November that  Mexico could have readied itself more for tariff-free borders.<p>

		"We're a little perplexed that the campesino groups would  come in and say, 'Oh my God, we're going to be destroyed. Come  2003, January 1, the flood gates open,"' a U.S. government  official told Reuters.<p>

		"And our point is, well, no, nothing's really changed."<p>

		The official, who asked not to be identified, said the only  area of real concern at the start of next year was in poultry,  which would be unable to handle a zero-tariff imports after  protection of 49 percent this year and more than 90 percent  last year.<p>

		"And we're working with the government of Mexico on poultry  just so we can try to reduce the sharp impact," he said. "They  did feel that they were unprepared to compete. In fact they  can't."<p>

		The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City was a target in recent  weeks for protests from farmers demanding the Jan. 1 border  opening be postponed, or that NAFTA be renegotiated.<p>

		Other protests saw the lower house of Congress blockaded by  farmers from around the country who rode into the city on  horseback, leading cows behind them, to demand more government  protection from U.S. competitors in the new year.<p>
