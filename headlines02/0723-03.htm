<p>DETROIT, July 22 -- Representatives of two Muslim advocacy groups charged today that law enforcement agents who last week searched the home of a man being investigated for connections to terrorism left behind a handwritten epithet on a Muslim prayer calendar in his home.</p>
    <p> The groups alleged that the message "Islam is Evil, Christ is King," was written in marker in the Dearborn home of Omar Shishani, who is being investigated by counterterror authorities after his arrest last week for allegedly bringing $12 million in counterfeit cashier's checks into the United States.</p>
    <p> The calendar issued by the Islamic Center of Detroit was on the family's refrigerator and contained no such message before law enforcement officers searched the family home Thursday, said Imad Hamad, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</p>
    <p> The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), based in Washington, called on Attorney General John D. Ashcroft to investigate the matter,  declaring that officers "do not have the right to insult the religious beliefs of those they are questioning."</p>
    <p> Hamad, who was contacted by Shishani's relatives after the arrest, said that Shishani's brother and wife were babysitting the family's two children when law enforcement agents arrived with guns drawn. The family did not notice the message on the calendar until the next day because they were so upset, Hamad said.</p>
    <p> "This defeats the purpose of the mission of law enforcement," Hamad said in an interview today from his Dearborn office. "It's very hard to swallow. It makes people more scared and less cooperative, especially when you feel they're treating everyone as a suspect."</p>
    <p> Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said officials had not yet received the letter from CAIR and were unable to comment on the allegations. But Comstock said the Justice Department "takes all allegations of backlash discrimination seriously," and has helped in prosecuting 80 such cases since Sept. 11.</p>
    <p> Shishani, 47, was arrested Wednesday night after arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on a flight from Indonesia. According to court papers, U.S. Customs agents found nine counterfeit checks -- including two for $5 million each -- during a search of his bags. Shishani was charged with knowingly making or possessing a forged security, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.</p>
    <p> The name "Omar Shishani" appears on a watch list of people trained in Afghanistan by al Qaeda, sources have said. The U.S. Attorney's Joint Terrorism Task Force in Detroit is investigating whether Shishani has terrorist ties.</p>
    <p> Hamad said that the Shishanis -- including his wife and two children -- had been visiting family. His wife returned home two weeks ago, while Shishani and his two children flew back to Detroit Wednesday.</p>
    <p> Shishani's attorney did not return telephone calls today, but a man who answered the door at Shishani's home Sunday said that Shishani is not a terrorist and will be coming home soon.</p>
    <p> Many neighbors said they did not know Shishani personally but that his two daughters often played with other neighborhood children.</p>
