<p>At St. Paul's Cathedral in London, 3,025 white rose petals floated down from 
the dome of the historic church to commemorate each of the Sept. 11 victims, 67 
of whom were British. 
<P>In Australia, thousands of people gathered in red, white and blue T-shirts 
to form a huge U.S. flag on Surfers' Paradise beach. 
<P>In Rome's Basilica Santa Maria degli Angeli, a memorial Mass included a twisted 
metal cross resting on a pile of rocks to symbolize the devastation of the attacks. 
<P>But compared with the warm embrace of sympathy that so many countries wrapped 
around America one year ago, a shift could be felt in many corners of the globe. 
<P>It is a shift from raw sorrow and sympathy to a more complex sense of caution 
and concern. One year after the day the world changed, people want America to 
know they are worried about the way the only superpower is projecting itself in 
the post-9/11 era, especially its rhetoric of possibly going it alone in a war 
against Iraq. 
<P>Voices as diverse as South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder have asked Americans to use the anniversary not only to mourn 
and stiffen their resolve in the war on terror, but also to take a long, hard 
look at themselves. 
<P>Schroeder, who has vociferously opposed the U.S. hard-line policy on Iraq and 
ruled out German forces taking part if there is a war, said in a speech Wednesday 
that the two countries had "a deeply rooted friendship that endures despite current 
differences of opinion." 
<P>Protesters outside the U.S. Consulate in Cape Town carried placards, one of 
which read, "9/11: Self-inflicted because of U.S. greed." A Soweto newspaper said 
in an editorial, "An attack on Baghdad could revive anti-U.S. sentiment and inspire 
further attacks on America or its friends -- like Israel. That would be an insult 
to the victims of 9/11." 
<P>Newspaper editorials across Europe reflected the shift. 
<P>The Paris daily Le Monde, which the day after the 9/11 attacks printed the 
headline "We are all Americans," was filled with critical columns Wednesday, one 
of which warned of a "new American imperialism." 
<P>Other editorials cautioned that if the United States were to go it alone in 
Iraq, it would risk unraveling the international coalition against terrorism that 
President Bush so carefully assembled in the aftermath of the attacks. 
<P>The liberal British newspaper, the Guardian, carried an editorial that took 
up the entire front page. It tried to spell out the unease with U.S. foreign policy 
that has developed in Europe as the Bush administration increasingly defined the 
world in simple terms of good and evil: 
<P>"The European press began to squirm uneasily at talk of evil, as if a wine 
and cheese party had suddenly turned into a Pentecostal revival meeting, and looked 
nervously round for the exit sign." 
<P>In Japan, which lost 24 citizens in the attacks, public support of the United 
States was evident at a ceremony outside the U.S. Embassy. Last fall, Japan swiftly 
adopted temporary legislation that circumvented its pacifist constitution and 
allowed the country's Self Defense Force to provide overseas, noncombat aid to 
the U.S. war on terrorism. 
<P>But Japanese public opinion is increasingly vocal against attacking Iraq. In 
a poll published last week by the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper, 77 percent 
opposed military action against Iraq. 
<P>America's staunchest ally -- with whom it shares bonds of history, language, 
and culture -- is still Great Britain. That closeness was apparent Wednesday in 
a ceremony at the historic Grosvenor Square in central London. 
<P>The square -- where John Adams lived as the first U.S. minister to the Court 
of St. James's and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower had his headquarters as commander of 
the Allied forces -- was the place where people piled bouquets, notes of sympathy, 
and makeshift shrines after 9/11. 
<P>New York Police Lt. Frank Dwyer presented British Home Secretary David Blunkett 
with a British flag found at ground zero. The flag was tattered and blackened 
in patches but intact. 
<P>U.S. Ambassador William Farish told a crowd of several thousand, "We gather 
here today to say thank you, again, to all those who rushed to our aid in America's 
darkest hour, and to all those who stood firmly by our side ever since." 
<P>At London's Heathrow International Airport, the world's largest air traffic 
hub, some British travelers worried that Washington was playing off the emotion 
of Sept. 11 to pursue a hawkish foreign policy. 
<P>Stephanie Morrell, 20, waiting for a friend to arrive from Madrid, said, "It 
is going to be a very emotional day. . . . But emotions can be dangerous." 
<P>Some saw signs that the United States was hearing the warnings. 
<P>"So many, many voices in the U.S. are being raised to say, 'America, let us 
engage in serious introspection. This is an opportunity for a hard look at ourselves.' 
That way lies the way to true greatness," said Tutu, who delivered the main sermon 
at the National Cathedral in Washington.
