<p>WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration's latest effort to protect the nation 
against terrorist attacks is raising concern that Americans are now at greater 
risk of intrusion from their own government. 
<P>The legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security, signed by President 
Bush on Monday, contains provisions that build on law enforcement's ability to 
peek at e-mail, monitor credit card purchases, bank transactions and travel patterns 
and shield its own activities from scrutiny. 
<P>Even critics acknowledge that taken individually, each provision is just a 
tiny step toward transforming the federal government into "Big Brother." But coupled 
with a series of recent court rulings favorable to the Department of Justice and 
new administration initiatives, privacy advocates warn that the nation is indeed 
experiencing the beginnings of a real-life Orwellian nightmare. 
<P>In recent weeks:
<P> 
<ul>
<li>The Pentagon confirmed the existence of the Total Information Awareness program, 
which will monitor passports, visas, work permits, airline tickets, rental cars, 
gun purchases, chemical purchases and other activities in search of potential 
terrorists. The program is being run by Adm. John Poindexter, President Ronald 
Reagan's national security adviser who was convicted in 1990 of five counts of 
lying to Congress in the Iran-Contra affair. (The convictions were overturned 
on a technicality.) Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. , said she plans to try to 
cut off funds for the program until Congress has a chance to review it.<br>
</li>
<li>A special federal appeals court ruled that the Justice Department has broad 
powers under the Patriot Act enacted last year to use wiretaps, read e- mails 
and conduct searches of suspected terrorists. Attorney General John Ashcroft called 
the ruling "a victory for liberty, safety and the security of the American people" 
and immediately stepped up the use of intelligence, saying the decision "revolutionizes 
our ability to investigate and prosecute terrorists" by allowing criminal investigators 
and intelligence officers to share information.<br>
</li>
<li>The Justice Department challenged a court order instructing it to release 
the names of hundreds of people arrested on immigration charges after the Sept. 
11 terrorist attacks. Federal attorneys argued that to make such information public 
would provide al Qaeda a "road map" to the government's anti-terrorism efforts.<br>
</li>
<li>A federal court in San Francisco rejected a challenge to the detention of 
about 600 war prisoners being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ruling that a group 
of clergy and professors have no legal standing to intervene. </li>
</ul>
<P>"Some of these measures have nothing to do with homeland security," said Jim 
Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C. "We continue 
to chip away at these protections, and we continue to move things off the books 
in a way that are away from scrutiny. It's a troubling step down the slippery 
slope." 
<P>The recent developments follow a vast expansion of the Justice Department's 
surveillance powers under the anti-terrorism bill passed last year, an easing 
of restrictions on FBI agents to infiltrate churches, mosques and political groups 
where terrorist activity is suspected, and the secretive detention of an estimated 
1,200 foreigners with suspected links to terrorism. 
<P>The United States has a long history of restricting civil liberties during 
times of war, from President Abraham Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas 
corpus to President Franklin Roosevelt's forced internment of more than 100,000 
Japanese Americans. 
<P>Most Americans appear to have accepted the activities as a reasonable precaution 
at a time of high risk, polls show, with the notable exception of Arab Americans, 
who have been the primary targets of law enforcement. 
<P><b
>FEARS OF UNENDING CONFLICT</b
> 
<P>However, unlike government crackdowns during the Civil War or World War II, 
the fight against terror is open-ended, prompting some concern that the government's 
new authority will last indefinitely, and ultimately affect a wider circle of 
Americans. And because so much of today's law enforcement activity is taking place 
in secret, civil libertarians warn that there are no judicial or congressional 
checks to make sure the power is not abused. 
<P>"There is a tremendous potential for abuse," said Elliot Mincberg, legal director 
for <a href="http://www.pfaw.org" target="_new">People for the American Way</a>, 
a liberal interest group that monitors the administration's judicial activity. 
"The Department of Homeland Defense is another example of . . . providing authority 
to the executive branch with a lack of effective oversight and checks and balances." 
<P>Justice Department officials say the real threat to freedom is posed by the 
terrorists. 
<P>"At this time and place, the threat to liberty is the disorder that terrorists 
seek to bring about in our government," Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh said 
in interview earlier this year. 
<P>Dinh, who fled Vietnam as a 10-year-old child, and was the chief author of 
the Patriot Act, said he has seen "threats to liberty from both the lack of government, 
and the excessive zeal of totalitarian control." 
<P>"It is not a balance between security and liberty. It is a liberty rooted in 
security," he said. 
<P>"Ask yourself this: When you take your child to a ballgame, are you more afraid 
of government agents watching your child, or terrorists attacking the ballpark. 
It's as simple as that. The threat to our freedom comes from Osama bin Laden, 
not the U.S. government." 
<P>The Department of Homeland Security is intended to combat terrorists by knocking 
down bureaucratic barriers and combining 170,000 federal workers, in agencies 
ranging from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Coast Guard and 
Customs Service, under a single department. 
<P>Buried in the legislative details is a provision calling for the creation of 
something that sounds like it was taken from George Orwell's "1984": the Directorate 
for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. The agency is charged 
with creating a massive database that could be used to identify future terrorists 
or, some fear, spy on alleged domestic enemies. 
<P><b
>LOWER THRESHOLD FOR E-MAIL</b
> 
<P>The legislation also lowers the threshold for Internet service providers to 
comply with government authorities who want to monitor e-mail. In the past, authorities 
had to show they were concerned about an "immediate danger," while under the new 
standard they must show only that they are acting out of a "reasonable belief" 
that a crime is about to occur. 
<P>As the government seeks to reduce the privacy of suspected terrorists, it also 
has extended its own power to shield information from the public. A provision 
in the legislation allows the agency to exempt itself in certain cases from Freedom 
of Information Act requests without any judicial review. 
<P>"Without vigilant oversight by Congress and accountability to U.S. citizens 
. . . there is a significant threat that this new department will abuse civil 
rights and infringe on civil liberties," said People for the American Way President 
Ralph Neas. 
<P>"Unfortunately, opportunities to attack the legitimate rights of Americans 
are widespread in our new reality, from harassing immigrants to the collection 
of massive quantities of data on all Americans, innocent and otherwise," Neas 
said.</p>
