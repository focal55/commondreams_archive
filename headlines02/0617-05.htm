<p>The CIA and US special forces have been given authority to use "lethal force" 
to capture or kill the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein. 
<P>Details emerged yesterday of an intelligence order signed by President George 
Bush instructing the CIA to conduct covert operations aimed at toppling the Iraqi 
leader. 
<P>The order, signed earlier this year, adds to increasing evidence that the US 
is planning an all-out assault to remove the Iraqi leader, who forms part of President 
Bush's so-called "axis of evil". 
<P>Government officials refused to comment on the order, but the Senate majority 
leader Tom Daschle confirmed that Congress had been consulted about the move. 
<P>The order, an expansion of a previous presidential finding designed to oust 
Saddam, was reported by the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, one of the men who 
uncovered the Watergate scandal. 
<P>President Bush has directed the CIA to use all available resources. These include 
increased support to Iraqi opposition groups and forces inside and outside the 
country in the form of money, equipment, training and intelligence. 
<P>The CIA is also increasing efforts to collect intelligence from within the 
Iraqi state and population. 
<P>The order also allows for the use of CIA and special forces similar to those 
deployed in Afghanistan since September 11 who would be authorized to kill the 
Iraqi leader if they were acting in self-defence. 
<P>President Bush first started talking openly about a pre-emptive strike two 
weeks ago, in a speech at the West Point military academy, although he did not 
specifically name Iraq. 
<P>"If we wait for threats to fully materialize we will have waited too long," 
he said. "The war on terror will not be won on the defensive. We must take the 
battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they 
emerge." 
<P>Mr Daschle said Congress had expressed some reservations about the timing of 
a strike. 
<P>"There is broad support for a regime change in Iraq," he said. "The question 
is how do we do it and when do we do it. I think the timing of all this is very 
important, but we want to work with the administration." 
<P>President Bush's war cabinet agreed in January that the policy of containment 
had failed. 
<P>According to the Post, the CIA director, George Tenet, has told Mr Bush that 
covert action without attendant military action has only about a 10% to 20% chance 
of success. 
<P>But covert action is viewed by some as a means of preparing for a military 
strike. It would identify targets, intensify intelligence-gathering on the ground 
and build contacts with future leaders, one source told the paper. Reports suggesting 
that Mr Bush had approved covert action first appeared at the end of February, 
but offered little detail. 
<P>The Guardian reported in the same month that the Pentagon and CIA had begun 
preparations for an assault using up to 200,000 troops. 
<P>That plan, however, is still fluid and could involve a smaller force, learning 
from the experience in Afghanistan. 
<P>In an interview in April, President Bush said: "I made up my mind that Hussein 
needs to go. That's about all I'm willing to share. The policy of my government 
is that he goes." 
<P>Washington fears that if attacked, Saddam may use chemical and biological weapons 
on US forces and Israel. As well as covert action, it has stepped up diplomatic 
and economic pressure on Iraq. 
<P>The CIA's covert war also involves arming and training Kurdish fighters in 
northern Iraq. The CIA has had a frosty relationship with the main opposition, 
the Iraqi National Congress, led by the London-based Ahmed Chalabi. But it has 
begun intensive consultations with the INC about training and arming its supporters. 
<P><B>&#183;</B> Iraq said yesterday that it wanted all UN sanctions against Baghdad 
lifted before an agreement could be reached on allowing weapons inspectors back 
into the country, according to the official Iraqi news agency. </p>
