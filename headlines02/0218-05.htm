The Public Broadcasting System recently dubbed him an "Uncommon 
American," but John W. Gardner was remembered and hailed yesterday as a man 
who cared deeply about everyday people and dedicated himself to helping 
improve local communities and the country.
<P>Gardner, who died Saturday at his Stanford University home at the age of 89, was the "father of campaign finance reform" who founded <a href="http://www.commoncause.org" target="_new">Common Cause</a> and was 
a driving force in the volunteer movement and in urban renewal.
<P>U.S. Rep. Pete Stark, D-Fremont, yesterday called him "a real Renaissance 
man," noting that he was not only the father of campaign finance reform but 
also dealt with educational issues and wrote books.
<P>An astoundingly hard worker with a jam-packed resume, his list of 
accomplishments ranges from being the Secretary of Health, Education and 
Welfare during the Johnson administration to advising presidents to founding 
and leading nonprofit organizations to teaching at Stanford.
<P>"When Americans attend open meetings or read their government's documents, 
or take part in our battered but resilient public finance system for 
presidential elections, there is a memorial to John Gardner," said Common 
Cause President Scott Harshbarger. "When we turn on public television, or when 
government ensures no senior or poor person goes without health care, we take 
part in programs John Gardner initiated."
<P>Gardner also was responsible for mentoring hundreds of people who are still 
working in organizations to improve society and the political process.
<P>"Like many people who are involved in our communities and our cities, I 
looked upon John as a mentor and a wise man who always was very willing to 
spend some time talking about communities and neighborhoods and strategies for 
intervention," former San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer said yesterday.
<P>Gardner was born in Los Angeles in 1912 and graduated from Stanford in 1935 
with a degree in psychology. He received his doctorate from the University of 
California at Berkeley.
<P>Although he was a Republican, Gardner joined President Lyndon Johnson's 
Cabinet in 1965. Gardner played a role in enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and was responsible for starting Medicare. He also presided over the 
creation of the Public Broadcasting System.
<P>After working in government, he became chairman of the National Urban 
Coalition, which attempted to heal scars from the 1968 race riots. In 1970, he 
founded Common Cause.
<P>"We are going to build a true 'citizens' lobby -- a lobby concerned not 
with the advancement of special interests but with the well-being of the 
nation," Gardner said as he announced the organization.
<P>Common Cause last year renamed its Public Service Achievement Award in his 
honor, and awarded it to him.
<P>Tony Miller, a campaign finance reform activist in California and former 
state secretary, said yesterday it was ironic that Gardner had died just as 
the House of Representatives approved significant changes in campaign finances.
<P>"He is obviously and will always be the patron saint of campaign finance 
reform," Miller said. "I'm sure he waited until we had meaningful campaign 
finance reform passed by the House before he decided to leave."
<P>But political funding was only one of Gardner's many interests. In the late 
1970s, he and partner Brian O'Connell founded the Independent Sector, a 
national coalition that has brought together more than 700 nonprofit 
organizations, foundations and corporate philanthropy programs.
<P>"In the passing of John Gardner, our country has lost one of its greatest 
builders of ideas and institutions and a unifier of people and cases," said 
Sara Melendez, president of the <a href="http://www.indepsec.org/" target="_new">Independent Sector</a>.
<P>"He was just a tiger when it came to fighting to make sure that the 
democratic process extended to everyone," O'Connell said yesterday.
<P>He was also well-known and admired at Stanford, where he returned as a 
trustee and as a professor. Richard Lyman, Stanford's president in the 1970s 
and a close friend of Gardner's, said yesterday that he was "a great preacher 
of the importance of leadership."
<P>Gardner worked hard at performing public service himself, serving on many 
boards of foundations and organizations.
<P>"There are countless people around the country leading nonprofit 
organizations -- if you asked them, 'Do you have any mentors?' they'd be 
likely to say John Gardner," Lyman said.
<P>"He was an incredibly busy person, but the extraordinary thing was that 
when you had a date with him to talk to him, he was completely there to talk 
to you," said Lyman's wife, Jing.
<P>Stanford is now home to the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their 
Communities, which was established in 2000.
<P>Gardner is survived by his wife of 67 years, Aida; two daughters, Stephanie 
Gardner Trimble and Francesca Gardner; two granddaughters and two grandsons; 
and a brother, Louis. Services are pending.</p>
