<p>SEOUL  - A defiant North Korea accused the United  States Friday of seeking to overthrow its political system,  adding that Washington was rushing into an extremely dangerous  confrontation.<p>

		The reclusive communist state's latest salvo, carried by  its official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), said a U.S.  demand that it scrap its nuclear program as a condition for  talks was a prelude to a surprise attack.<p>

		Its comments followed a demand from South Korea's  president-elect, a dove on relations with the North, that it  drop plans to reactivate a reactor capable of producing  plutonium for nuclear weapons.<p>

		"(The United States) is rushing headlong into extremely  dangerous confrontation with the DPRK (North Korea), saying  that it would neither have dialogue with the DPRK nor rule out  a war against it," KCNA said.<p>

<b><font size="2">'Hawkish and Dangerous</font></b>'<br>U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld speaks to the press at the Pentagon briefing, December 23, 2002. Rumsfeld said the U.S. was capable of fighting and winning not one war but two if need be, upping the rhetorical pressure on both Iraq and North Korea, twin targets of Washington's drive against weapons of mass destruction.

</table></font>"The U.S. much publicized assertion that North Korea should  scrap its nuclear program first is nothing but a pipe-dream as  it calls for disarming the DPRK under the absurd pretext of its  'nuclear program' and then launching a surprise attack on it to  overthrow its political system," it added.<p>

		President Bush has denounced North Korea as a member of an  "axis of evil" with Iran and Iraq, which also accuses  Washington of seeking to topple its president, Saddam Hussein.<p>

		Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Monday the United  States, which is focusing on ridding Iraq of weapons of mass  destruction, could fight two wars at once and win and that  North Korea would be mistaken to assume Washington would be  distracted by the Iraq standoff.<p>

		As Washington pushed for more international pressure on the  North, Australia put plans to build an embassy in the North  Korean capital, Pyongyang, on hold.<p>

		South Korea's Roh Moo-hyun, who takes office on February  25, delivered the strongest message to date from Seoul on the  crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear intentions.<p>

		"North Korea must withdraw the nuclear measures it has  taken and restore facilities and equipment to their original  state," said Roh, who won South Korea's December 19  presidential election on a platform of dialogue with the North.<p>

		Roh spoke out after North Korea told the United Nations it  planned to restart the reactor within two months.<p>

		In Washington, a Bush administration official accused China  and Russia of dragging their feet over the crisis.<p>

		CHINESE IRRITATION<p>

		China has not commented on the U.S. accusation but there  were signs Friday of Beijing's irritation with U.S. rhetoric.  The official English-language China Daily criticized Rumsfeld's  remarks as "hawkish and dangerous."<p>

		Roh told the North its defiance of world opinion hindered  efforts to help revive its economy and end diplomatic  isolation.<p>

		"North Korea's moves defy the international community's  wishes for an end to the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction, and run counter to the hopes of our nation for  peace on the Korean peninsula," he said in a statement.<p>

		The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said Thursday the plan to restart  the small, five-megawatt reactor raised serious  non-proliferation concerns and was tantamount to nuclear  brinkmanship.<p>

		The reactor and three related facilities at Yongbyon, 55  miles north of Pyongyang, were mothballed under a 1994  nonproliferation pact with the United States, which offered  oil in return for compliance.<p>

		The United States said in October the North had admitted  operating a secret weapons program using highly enriched  uranium. The United States, South Korea and others suspended  fuel oil shipments to the impoverished North in December.<p>

		North Korea, which says it is reactivating the plant to  produce electricity to make up for lost fuel oil supplies,  wants Washington to sign a non-aggression pact and hold direct  talks on their differences.<p>

		U.S. officials describe the standoff as a ploy by the North  to force Washington into talks on normalizing relations.<p>

		Washington has expressed confidence that diplomacy can  defuse the crisis and has been pressing Russia and China, which  is the North's chief ally, to use their influence.<p>

		But a Bush administration official expressed frustration on  Thursday with their response so far.<p>

		The official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said  that normally, Russia and China signaled when they were working  together with U.S. policymakers on a foreign-policy headache.<p>

		"The fact that we're not hearing very much is pretty  telling evidence," he said. "If there's anybody who can get  North Korea to stop this, it would be Russia and China."<p>

		In Beijing, the China Daily denounced a Rumsfeld remark  that the United States, which is focusing on ridding Iraq of  weapons of mass destruction, could fight two wars at once and  win.<p>

		"This is a hawkish and dangerous warning," the newspaper  said of Rumsfeld's comments Monday. "It will poison the warming  relations between the two sides on the Korean peninsula."<p>

		U.S. Officials say Washington, which suspects North Korea  has two nuclear bombs, is looking toward a January 6 meeting of  the IAEA board of governors, who are expected to move the  North's breach of its obligations to the U.N. Security Council.<p>

		South Korea's Roh said the crisis could undermine his  strategy of promoting aid and dialogue with the North.<p>

		"If the worries of South Koreans over North Korea's moves  escalate, this government and the new government will be  hamstrung and North-South exchanges will suffer a negative  impact," he added.<p>
