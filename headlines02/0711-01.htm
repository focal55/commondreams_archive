<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MIKHAIL Gorbachev last night branded George W Bush and Tony Blair a threat to world peace.</p>
<p>The former Russian president said US and British plans to attack Iraq and topple 
Saddam Hussein would wreck the international coalition against terrorism.</p>
<p>And he singled out Bush's go-it-alone policy in the face of concern from world leaders as the key component to putting global security at risk.</p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev, who dragged the former Soviet Union out of the Cold War era, insisted political negotiation was the only way to achieve peace throughout the world.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old said: "I strongly hope the US and Britain will not be fighting a war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>"They should be using political means not military.</p>
<p>"I am generally concerned about the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>"The right approach to this issue can only be developed in co-operation with the United States and Russia as co-sponsors of the peace process, the European Union and the Arab countries. They should all work together."</p>
<p>On US plans for a large-scale military invasion of Iraq, Mr Gorbachev said: "I believe very strongly such plans should not be made.</p>
<p>"We have a full set of political, economic and diplomatic methods that should be used to deal with Iraq. America must not ignore the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>"Important and serious political decisions should not be taken unilaterally.</p>
<p>"If such decisions are taken unilaterally that could destroy the coalition against terror, that is the reality.</p>
<p>"Iraq is an important country and both that nation and the world should not be put at risk without really trying all the other various measures and approaches available."</p>
<p>His swipe at joint Anglo-American military projects will be embarrassing to No10.</p>
<p>Mr Blair has been widely regarded as President Bush's "poodle" for his unswerving backing of his strike plans.</p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev said the PM should revert to the "political path" used in the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>
<p>Speaking in Portcullis House, the new building for MPs at Westminster, he added: "Even though there are still problems there, you took the right path. The path of the political settlement. That is a good message for Britain and all others.</p>
<p>"Such things should be addressed politically."</p>
<p>He also criticized Britain's controversial decision to export parts for F-16 fighter jets via the US for use in Israel against Palestinians - which was approved by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>His damning indictment of US-British policy came on a two-day visit to Britain to appeal to world leaders for help in destroying Russia's stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev earned worldwide admiration for ushering in the era of glasnost and perestroika in Russia.</p>
<p>He worked relentlessly to force the US and others to join his campaign to cut weapons of mass destruction and improve world security.</p>
<p>But yesterday he was despairing of the aggressive agenda coming from the White House, supported by Downing Street, on Iraq and the Middle East.</p>
<p>In a warning to Mr Blair Mr Gorbachev said: "Allies of the US should be saying 'don't launch a new arms race. I am concerned at growing military budgets.</p>
<p>"President Bush is concerned about the security of his nation, we understand that.</p>
<p>"But we are still dealing with the consequences of the old arms race without starting a new one.</p>
<p>"Why do that when we are looking for money to cut weapons of mass destruction and to cut poverty in the world, which is often the cause of terrorism.</p>
<p>"I am trying very hard to project a certain logic on this to the people in a position to take decisions."</p>
<p>Hours after speaking to the Daily Mirror yesterday, Mr Gorbachev joined members of the public to watch Mr Blair at Question Time in the Commons.</p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev is founder of the Green Cross international campaign to slash stockpiles of large weapons.</p>
<p>Western intelligence agencies have warned corrupt ex-KGB officers and military officials could net huge bribes from terrorist groups and Mafia outfits to sell nuclear materials or nerve agents.</p>
<p>He said the "terrible legacy" of the Cold War could be exploited by rogue states and terrorists like al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev warned: "The battle against al-Qaeda should be continued because they are a big organization and they are a danger.</p>
<p>"Groups will try to acquire these weapons."</p>
<p>He wants more EU cash to get rid of the massive arsenal of chemical weapons being stored unsafely in Russia.</p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev said: "The US and the Soviet Union each spent the equivalent of 10 trillion dollars on the arms race. Now hundreds of billions will be needed to destroy these weapons."</p>
