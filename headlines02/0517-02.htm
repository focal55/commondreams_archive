<p>ATLANTA, May 16 — The board of the <org idsrc="NYSE" value="TVC;TVE">Tennessee Valley Authority</org> voted today to spend $1.7 billion to restart a troubled nuclear reactor at its Browns Ferry plant in northern Alabama, a decision that could produce the first substantial increase in the nation's nuclear-generating capacity in more than a decade.</p>

The three reactors at Browns Ferry, on the Tennessee River near Athens, Ala., were shut down in 1985 after engineers discovered that they did not precisely match their blueprints. Even before then, the plant had a history of operating problems caused by a fire in 1975. After corrections were made, the authority restarted the second and third reactor units in 1991 and 1996.
<P> The first reactor was left idle because its capacity was not needed, but board members said today that with electricity demand growing, they needed a generator that would not add to the region's air quality problems.</p>
<P> "We must balance the responsibility to provide power to meet future needs with our objectives of protecting the environment and continuing the trend of debt reduction," said Skila Harris, one of the authority's three board members, who was an assistant to former Vice President Al Gore. "Restarting Unit 1 will provide needed generating capacity without increasing air emissions."</p>
<P> The unanimous vote came over the objections of several area residents, who said the plant was insufficiently protected against a terrorist attack, and from environmental groups expressing concern about the reactor's design.</p>
<P> "They're taking an old nuclear reactor that has not operated for 17 years, and they're going to run it longer and harder than it was designed for," said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, based in Knoxville, Tenn. "It originally had a design life of 40 years, which they want to extend for 20 years, and they want to force it to produce 1,300 megawatts when it was designed for 1,000. It's a prescription for a serious problem."</p>
<P> There has been no new construction of a nuclear plant since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; the last nuclear plant to begin operation was the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar reactor in eastern Tennessee, which began full operation in 1996. The Bush administration, however, has expressed renewed interest in pursuing the technology, as have some large utilities.</p>
<P> An operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would be required before the reactor could be restarted. No other approval is needed for the authority to prepare the plant for reopening. T.V.A. officials said they hoped to pay for the work from the annual revenues of the authority's system.</p>
<P> When the Browns Ferry plant was completed in 1977, it was the largest nuclear power plant in the world, the first to generate more than a billion watts of electricity. It uses boiling-water reactors, an older technology than the pressurized-water reactors that are in newer nuclear plants. The T.V.A. is not planning to change the fundamental design of the plant, leading some critics to suggest that it is spending too much money on antiquated technology.</p>
<P> "For the same amount of money, they could build a brand-new reactor that's safer and has a longer life," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear-safety engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group often opposed to nuclear-plant expansion. "It's like trying to dust off an eight-track tape player rather than buying a DVD system — they're not getting good value for their money."</p>
<P> No nuclear plant has ever been restarted after such a long period in mothballs, Mr. Lochbaum added.</p>
<P> Authority officials disagreed with that analysis. Gil Francis, a T.V.A. spokesman, said the authority had looked at every option available for meeting power demands by 2010 and concluded that it was less expensive and cleaner to restart the reactor than to build one, or to add to the authority's battery of coal, gas and hydroelectric plants.</p>
<P> "Every option had its pros and cons," Mr. Francis said. "Coal plants have emission issues and high capital costs; gas-fired plants have the volatility in the price of fuel. But considering the economies of scale of having the existing reactors nearby, we think restarting this reactor will return its investment in eight years of operation."</p>
<P> The upgraded plant, which would be ready for operation by 2006, would add the latest technology to the reactor, Mr. Francis said. </p>
<P> Most elected officials in the region support the T.V.A.'s action, which would create 2,400 jobs, and several union leaders gave their enthusiastic approval to the plan at today's hearing. Representative Zach Wamp, a Republican who represents the Chattanooga area, said it was hypocritical of environmental groups to oppose a generating technology that does not add to air pollution.</p>
<P> "There's a great debate in the Tennessee Valley over the degraded air quality in the Smokies and around the valley, and how much the T.V.A. plants contribute to it," Mr. Wamp said. "Well, clearly if you want cleaner air, the development of more nuclear reactors is the way to go, and Browns Ferry 1 is the logical place to start. You can't have it both ways."</p>
<P> Environmental leaders, however, said the problem of nuclear waste disposal had still not been resolved and suggested that the authority would be better off spending the $1.7 billion cleaning up the fossil-fuel plants that are now operating.</p>
<P> The T.V.A. is the nation's largest public producer of electricity, serving about 8.3 million people in seven states. About two-thirds of its power comes from 11 fossil-fuel plants, while most of the rest comes from three nuclear plants and 29 hydroelectric dams.</p>
