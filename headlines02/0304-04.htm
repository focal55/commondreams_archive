Maryland's population of Baltimore orioles, long in decline, could vanish altogether late this century because of dramatic changes in migration patterns and declining habitats strongly influenced by global warming.
<p>A new study to be released this week by the National Wildlife Federation and the American Bird Conservancy suggests that the effects of global warming may be robbing Maryland and a half-dozen other states of an important piece of their heritage by hastening the departure of their state birds. </p>

The report says the Earth's rising temperature, which scientists attribute to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, is already shifting songbird ranges, altering migration behavior and perhaps diminishing some species' ability to survive.
<p>The ranges of some state birds could shrink or shift entirely outside the states they represent. That could mean Iowa and Washington state would eventually lose the American goldfinch, New Hampshire would say goodbye to the purple finch, California would lose the California quails, Massachusetts' black-capped chickadee would vanish, Georgia would lose the brown thrasher and Maryland would lose its beloved Baltimore oriole, according to the study, which was provided to The Washington Post.</p>
    <p>"Imagine Baltimore without the Baltimore oriole," said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation. "Left unchecked, global warming could cause the birds we love to watch and even celebrate on state emblems to disappear from places they've lived for eons."</p>
    <p>Peter Schultz, a global-warming expert with the nonprofit National Research Council, cautions that long-term forecasts of disruptions in bird migration patterns are difficult to do. </p>
    <p>"I would be surprised if the distribution of state birds is not changed down the road," he said. "But predicting precisely where they'll be 50 years from now is very difficult, if not impossible, with the current state of knowledge."</p>
    <p>Baltimore orioles (<i>Icterus galbula</i>) were once so numerous that famed naturalist painter John J. Audubon wrote about the delight of hearing "the melody resulting from thousands of musical voices that come from some neighboring tree." </p>
    <p>The bird, a Maryland icon whose namesake is Baltimore's major league baseball team, was officially designated the state bird in 1947.</p>
    <p>The female oriole's feathers are brownish-olive and dull orange, but the male's plumage is black and golden orange. </p>
    <p>According to legend, George Calvert, the first baron of Baltimore, fancied the oriole's plumage and took its colors for his coat of arms.</p>
    <p>Ornithologists and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have warned for decades that many common songbird species, including blue jays, wood thrushes and Baltimore orioles, were steadily declining.</p>
    <p>Scientists have blamed the Baltimore oriole's gradual decline largely on the destruction of breeding habitat and forests both in North America, where the bird spends its summers, and in Central and South America, where it winters.</p>
    <p>Now some scientists are shifting their attention to the long-term effects of global warming on the migratory patterns of the oriole and other popular songbirds.</p>
    <p>"Climate change on top of fragmented habitat is the straw that breaks the camel's back," said Patricia Glick, an expert on climate change with the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
    <p>The Earth's surface temperature warmed more during the last century than any other century during the last thousand years, the study says. Climate models used as part of a United Nations-sponsored international climate change study predict that average surface temperatures will rise an additional 2.5 to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. </p>
    <p>That's more than 10 times the average rate of global temperature change since the Ice Age.</p>
    <p>Like those of many plants and animals, birds' life cycles and behavior are closely linked to the changing seasons. For Neotropical migrant species such as the Baltimore oriole, warblers and other songbirds, changes in the weather help signal when they should begin their long flights southward in the fall and back again in the spring. Variables such as temperature and precipitation also affect the timing and availability of flowers, seeds and other food sources for the birds when they reach their destination.</p>
    <p>Studies in the United States and Europe have found that some songbirds are migrating earlier in spring months, corresponding with warmer temperatures. </p>
    <p>For example, research on migratory birds in North America shows that the arrival dates of 20 species were up to 21 days earlier in 1994 than in 1965, while only a few species were later.</p>
    <p>The new study asserts that as regional temperatures rise, the climatic ranges of a number of species in the Northern Hemisphere could shift north as they seek habitat and food to which they have adapted. In the ranges they leave behind, these birds may be replaced by species from the south. </p>
    <p>Moving to a new range can be tricky, because the birds face new prey, predators and competitors, as well as different habitats.</p>
    <p>To determine how the future summer distributions of birds might change, Jeff Price, director of climate change for the American Bird Conservancy, developed large-scale statistical models of the association between current bird distributions and a number of significant variables, such as temperature and precipitation.</p>
    <p>According to the study, the eastern Midwest and Great Lakes region could be the hardest hit by the long-term effects of global warming, with up to a 30 percent net loss in the number of Neotropical migrant species summering in the region.</p>
    <p>Affected species include olive-sided flycatchers, solitary vireos and Cape May warblers, which are important in controlling insects in forests and agricultural areas. </p>
    <p>As many as 33 states could see a significant reduction in American goldfinches in the summer. In addition, some migratory bird species, such as the endangered golden-cheeked warbler in Texas, could face extinction.</p>
    <p>Environmentalists stress that although the long-term forecast is gloomy, the loss of the birds could be averted if government and industry agree on policies for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and improving the energy efficiency of cars, homes and offices.</p>
    <p>"This is happening to species of birds we care about, but there's something we can do about it," said Jamie Rappaport Clark, a senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
