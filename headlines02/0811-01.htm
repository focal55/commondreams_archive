<p>Israel on Saturday prevented U.S. peace activists traveling with U.S. congressional 
staff members on a fact-finding mission to the Palestinian territories and Israel 
from entering the West Bank, according to the activists, the State Department 
and an Israeli official. 
<p>Yaffa Ben-Ari, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Israel objected to the 
entry of the peace activists traveling with the U.S. team.

</font>The activists were three representatives of the American Muslims for Jerusalem 
organization and Jews for Peace in Palestine and Israel organization, said Josh 
Ruebner, head of the JPPI. He said they planned to meet with American and international 
humanitarian organizations in the West Bank and Gaza. 
<p>"Since Israel has the sovereign right to decide who can enter Israel and who 
can't, we have the right to prevent groups who we know ahead of time are coming 
to demonstrate and cause provocation in places where Israeli soldiers are fighting 
terrorism," Ben-Ari said. 
<p>In Washington, the State Department said two of the three "coordinators" with 
the congressional staff members were denied entry into Israel when they arrived 
at the Allenby Bridge border crossing from the Jordanian side. The congressional 
staff members themselves decided not to present their passports to the Israeli 
authorities for inspection and permission to enter, the State Department said. 
<p>It wasn't immediately clear which U.S. representatives the congressional staff 
members were representing. The delegation could not be reached for comment, and 
Khalid Turanni, executive director of the American Muslims for Jerusalem, refused 
to provide their names. 
<p>Ruebner said he was allowed to enter Israel but refused because two other activists 
were denied permission. 
<p>In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, Ruebner criticized Israel for 
blocking the entry of the activists and the congressional staff members. Both 
Israel and the State Department said that the U.S. team never attempted to cross 
the border. 
<p>"This unprecedented slap in the face to members of Congress is Israel's way 
of repaying the institution which gives it three billion dollars of taxpayers' 
money every year," he said. "What does Israel not want Congress to see?" 
<p>Turaani said he and the other American Muslim activist were denied entry because 
they were Muslims. "We still maintain that the Israeli discrimination against 
the American Muslims in the delegation is disturbing and the State Department's 
acquiescence is shameful." Turaani is Jordanian-American of Palestinian origin. 
<p>The State Department said the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem and the embassy 
in Tel Aviv have been deeply involved in attempting to facilitate entry for the 
entire group. 
<p>Before they left the United States, a State Department officer discussed the 
trip with the coordinators and urged that they contact Israeli officials in advance 
to facilitate their entry. When they arrived at the bridge, the Tel Aviv embassy 
urged Foreign Ministry and Interior Ministry officials to give every consideration 
to their entry, the State Department said.

</font>Leftists forcibly prevented from entering Bethlehem</b> 
<p>Earlier Saturday, Israeli protestors from the <a href="  http://taayush.tripod.com/index.html" target="_new">Ta'ayush</a> 
movement to promote relations between Arabs and Jews in Israel, were forcibly 
turned away by police from a roadblock into Bethlehem while attempting to enter 
the West Bank city to join a Palestinan demonstration for peace. 
<p>One of the Israeli demonstrators reported that the police turned water cannons 
on the crowd, before mounted officers rode their horses into the demonstrators 
and began beating them. 
<p>She said that the demonstrators tried to enter Bethlehem through another roadblock 
but were also turned away from there, although without the use of violent means. 
<p>One of the demonstrators wounded in the incident was taken to hospital for 
treatment.
