<p>As an international conference on whale protection opened at the home of Japan's whaling fleet Monday, global conservation groups accused the Asian giant of "buying" votes to end a worldwide ban on commercial hunting for whale meat.
<p>
Greenpeace International and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said Japan was using foreign aid to persuade members of the International Whaling Commission  (IWC), meeting this week in the southern port-city of Shimonoseki, to overturn a moratorium on commercial whale hunts.
<p>




"[Japan's] fisheries agency has been actively going out and buying the votes of developing countries by giving them fisheries grant aid," said Richard Page, an anti-whaling campaigner for Greenpeace International, whose presence at Shimonoseki has already provoked angry demonstrations by nationalist right-wing parties there.
<p>




"As the Japanese government recruits more poor countries into the IWC in exchange for overseas development aid, the balance of power is shifting within the commission and it will become impossible for anti-whaling nations to maintain the moratorium much longer," Greenpeace warned in a statement issued Sunday.
<p>



To lift the moratorium, three-quarters of the IWC's membership of 48 countries must vote to do so. While Tokyo is still short of that goal, it needs only a simple majority to change some of the rules under which the IWC operates.
<p>



Four new developing-country members--Benin, Gabon, Palau, and Mongolia--will be taking part in IWC deliberations for the first time at the five-day meeting. Among the four, only Mongolia, which is land-locked, is expected not to follow Japan's lead.
<p>




Two other new members, Portugal and San Marino, are expected to vote with countries opposed to lifting the ban, of which the most aggressive include Australia and several other South Pacific countries, Britain, and the United States.
<p>



Japan has been spearheading the movement in favor of hunting for whale meat, sold primarily to restaurants where it remains a popular menu item. Last March, there were even reports that Japan was resuming imports of whale meat for the first time in 11 years, from Norway, which remains a major hunter despite the moratorium by the IWC, created in 1946 to "provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks."
<p>




With a long whaling tradition, Japan has argued against the ban virtually from its adoption in 1986. Joined by Norway, Tokyo has argued more recently that whale herds have sufficiently recovered to justify ending the moratorium.
<p>



WWF said that since the moratorium, nearly 23,000 whales from five species had been killed, mostly by Norway and Japan. Japan kills up to 600 whales each year, including 540 minke whales, 50 Bryde's whales, and 10 sperm whales, according to the group.
<p>




Two months ago, Tokyo announced its intention to expand whaling operations to hunt 50 sei whales in the North Pacific. The sei whales, which are distinguished by their slim, streamlined bodies, have been listed by the World Conservation Union as endangered, because they face a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future.
<p>



"It may only be a matter of time before the Japanese government recruits enough votes and the IWC will once again sanction commercial whaling, putting the world's remaining whales at risk," according to Greenpeace, which mounted a colorful demonstration Monday outside Shimonoseki's convention center waving banners calling for "Aid for aid, not for whaling."
<p>




The controversy surrounding the accusations prompted an official response last week, that "there is nothing like vote-buying going on." "Japan is providing aid to more than 150 countries," said Joji Matsushita, a Fisheries Agency official and a member of Japan's IWC delegation. "It's hard to find places that don't get our aid," he said.
<p>




However, in a report released in January, Greenpeace charged that Tokyo has spent over US&#36;320 million since 1987 in order to gain votes on the IWC for its position. In 2001, it said, over &#36;47 million was spent buying the votes of six Caribbean countries - Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
<p>



Greenpeace cited an article carried by The Caribbean News Agency which quoted the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Lester Bird, saying that there was indeed a bargain. "So long as the whales are not an endangered species," he told the agency, "If we are able to support the Japanese, and the quid pro quo is that they are going to give us some assistance, I am not going to be a hypocrite; that is part of why we do so."
