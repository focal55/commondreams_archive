            WASHINGTON -- The accounting firm Andersen acknowledged Thursday that 
            it destroyed a "significant" number of documents related to its audit 
            of Enron Corp., as the White House disclosed that Enron's chief executive 
            contacted Bush Cabinet members for help when the energy company was 
            collapsing.
            <p>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans 
              said they listened to Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay's description 
              of the firm's dire financial problems last fall but took no action.

</table>Both revelations deepened the controversy over Enron's sudden failure--one 
              that has financial, legal and political overtones. The disclosure 
              by Andersen, until recently known as Arthur Andersen, prompted outrage 
              in Congress and could complicate federal investigations into the 
              massive bankruptcy. Andersen said in a statement that it had disposed 
              of a "significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper 
              documents and correspondence" relating to Enron. Investigators could 
              not immediately say what documents were destroyed. A company spokesman 
              said the matter is under review and would not say whether the destruction 
              was accidental or intentional. The company said millions of documents 
              related to Enron still exist.
            <p>A congressional aide said Andersen notified investigators that 
              "potentially thousands of records" were destroyed in September, 
              October and November. Investigators plan to meet with the head of 
              Andersen's Houston office next week and question him on the matter.
            <p>Despite the administration's efforts to distance itself from the 
              Enron fiasco, the company's huge political footprint continued to 
              create problems. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, his chief of staff and 
              the entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston, where Enron is based, 
              recused themselves from the criminal probe of the company because 
              of potential conflicts of interest.
            <p>Ashcroft received campaign contributions from Enron for his failed 
              2000 Senate campaign, and the U.S. attorney in Houston said many 
              on his staff have family members who could be affected by the Enron 
              bankruptcy.
            <p>The fallout touched the White House, as President Bush ordered 
              senior officials to recommend reforms of the pension system and 
              to examine federal rules governing corporate disclosures. Investigators 
              are probing whether company officials withheld financial information 
              from investors who, along with employees in the company pension 
              plan, suffered huge losses in the firm's collapse.
            <p>"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of the Enron executive, 
              a generous donor to Bush's political campaigns. "But what anybody's 
              going to find is that this administration will fully investigate 
              issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn 
              from the past and make sure that workers are protected."
            <p>The latest twist in the Enron saga came one day after the Justice 
              Department launched a criminal probe of the company, investigating, 
              among other matters, whether Enron knew of problems but failed to 
              disclose them. In congressional testimony last month, the head of 
              Andersen said he had warned Enron that the company might be guilty 
              of "possible illegal acts" for withholding financial information 
              from auditors--an allegation Enron denied.
            <p>Andersen's destruction of records drew angry reactions from members 
              of Congress investigating the accounting methods used by the auditor.
            <p>Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) of the House Energy and Commerce 
              Committee called the loss "deeply troubling" and vowed to investigate.
            <p>"It should never have happened," Tauzin said. "Clearly this is 
              a very serious matter. Anyone who destroyed records simply out of 
              stupidity should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally 
              to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted."
            <p>"The list of problems and problem people involved in this entire 
              tawdry affair seems destined to grow," said Rep. John D. Dingell 
              of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
              "The seriousness of this matter cries out for further investigation."
            <p>Stephen Cutler, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's 
              enforcement division, called the record destruction an "extremely 
              serious matter" but added that it "will not deter us from pursuit 
              of our investigation and will be included within the scope of our 
              investigation."
            <p>The SEC is investigating whether Enron used loopholes in accounting 
              regulations to hide debt. In addition, Congress is looking into 
              Andersen's interpretation of accounting rules that allowed Enron 
              to exclude losses at several partnerships from its reporting. Enron 
              and Andersen dispute who is to blame for the faulty accounting.
            <p>On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million 
              and disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On 
              Nov. 8, it announced it had overstated its earnings by $586 million 
              during the last four years, sending the company's stock tumbling 
              from more than $90 a share a year earlier to less than a dollar. 
              The meltdown cost more than 4,000 employees their jobs and destroyed 
              the retirement savings of employees with company-sponsored savings 
              plans.
            <p>Because, as the company said, the retirement plan was changing 
              administrators, those employees were locked out of selling their 
              shares at the time the stock began its most precipitous descent. 
              However, many executives managed to sell their shares just before 
              the stock's plunge.
            <p>The company filed for protection from its creditors Dec. 2.
            <p>At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called 
              O'Neill and Evans separately, reporting "his concerns about whether 
              or not Enron would be able to meet its obligations."
            <p>O'Neill said in the two calls he received--on Oct. 28 and Nov. 
              8, according to an aide--Lay expressed concern about the implications 
              for the capital markets and also that a possible downgrading of 
              the company's credit rating might ruin a pending merger prospect.
            <p>Lay did not ask for anything specific, O'Neill said. "As secretary 
              of the Treasury with responsibility for the U.S. capital markets, 
              I get calls every day from the big players in the world" warning 
              about important financial events, he told CNN.
            <p>But Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay did draw a comparison 
              with Long Term Capital Management, a large investment firm that 
              was saved from collapse in 1998 by a federally orchestrated private 
              bailout.
            <p>Lay "expressed a concern that if Enron went bankrupt, it would 
              affect the credit markets the way the Long Term Capital Management 
              problems a few years earlier affected the credit markets, that it 
              would have ripple effects throughout the whole banking sector," 
              she said.
            <p>Davis said O'Neill never discussed a bailout or any other kind 
              of aid for Enron.
            <p>Evans said Lay was hoping for high-level "support."
            <p>Fleischer said that the secretaries decided not to inform Bush 
              of the calls and that Bush did not learn of them until Thursday 
              morning.
            <p>Fleischer said Evans and O'Neill handled the matter appropriately. 
              Communication "is not a wrongdoing. What took place here was they 
              received phone calls and took no action."
            <p>However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said the calls show 
              that the administration had advance word of Enron's collapse and 
              did nothing to protect shareholders or employees.
            <p>Fleischer dismissed the criticism as partisan rhetoric, "what people 
              have become so used to in Washington, which is a politically charged, 
              politically motivated effort to blame one party or to look only 
              at one party." Enron, he said, has given hundreds of thousands of 
              dollars to both parties.
            <p>Bush said he had not spoken with Lay about his company's financial 
              problems and had not seen him since last spring, when they met at 
              a Houston theater where the president's mother was the sponsor of 
              a book-reading fund-raiser by celebrity authors.
            <p>Lay was a so-called pioneer in Bush's presidential campaign, which 
              meant he committed to raising at least $100,000.
            <p>Lay also personally contributed more than $275,000 to the Republican 
              National Committee during the 2000 election cycle, part of overall 
              donations from company employees and directors to the RNC that exceeded 
              $1.1 million. Enron gave $100,000 to help pay for Bush's inauguration. 
              In that cycle, Enron employees and directors gave $530,000 to the 
              Democratic National Committee; Lay made no personal contributions 
              to the DNC.
            <p>In calling for an examination of the pension rules, Bush said he 
              directed O'Neill, Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to determine 
              "the effects of the current law on hard-working Americans and to 
              come up with recommendations of how to reform the system to make 
              sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as 
              the result of a bankruptcy, for example."
            <p>In addition, he said that O'Neill, along with the SEC, the Federal 
              Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would study 
              corporate disclosure rules and regulations in light of the Enron 
              bankruptcy.
            <p>"There needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure 
              that the American stockholder, or any stockholder, is protected," 
              Bush said.
            <p>Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the 
              world's largest energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled 
              1 in 4 wholesale deals for electricity, gas and other energy products.
            <p>The company championed energy deregulation and tried to influence 
              the way California structured its energy markets and how the state 
              steered through its electricity crisis. It became a target of attacks 
              from politicians, regulators and consumer activists for its aggressive 
              business tactics.
