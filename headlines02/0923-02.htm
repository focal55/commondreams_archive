<p>Twice as many people uprooted from their homes by war or civil conflict remain 
caught inside their homelands than flee across borders into foreign countries 
where they are eligible for protection and help as refugees under international 
law, according to a major four-year survey released Monday.
<p>At some 25 million people, comprising mostly women and children, the global 
population of internally displaced persons (IDPs) vastly outnumbers conventional 
refugees, making them a rising concern among international humanitarian agencies. 
The total number of IDPs in sub-Saharan Africa alone, 13.5 million, exceeds the 
world's entire refugee population, according to "The 2002 Global IDP Survey." 
<p> "The survey confirms two worrying trends," said Andrew Lawday of the Global 
IDP Project. "First, that large numbers of innocent civilians are being forced 
from their homes by increased insecurity in the world; and secondly, that many 
of these people remain officially neglected by government authorities." 
<p> The survey, which covers 47 countries, said 25 million IDPs was a conservative 
estimate. In another report published earlier this year, the U.S. Committee for 
Refugees (USCR) found at least 22 million IDPs at the end of the 2001, but stressed 
that the actual total "may be much higher." 
<p> Those fleeing persecution who manage to reach a foreign country generally 
find themselves in a far more stable situation than IDPs. Refugees may be obliged 
to live in camps, but even in such confined situations they generally can count 
on adequate shelter, nutrition, security, and even schooling and employment. 
<p> But IDPs receive very little if any support or protection. Conflicting parties 
in a civil war, for example, may prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid to those 
in need or even abduct displaced children and women as forced labor, army recruits 
or sexual slaves. IDPs who were forced to leave their homes due to their political 
beliefs or ethnic background often find themselves in constant fear that their 
identity will be discovered. 
<p> According to the survey, 10 million of the 13.5 million IDPs in Africa can 
be found in three countries: Sudan, which has four million IDPs, Angola and Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. While in Angola a peace accord between the government and 
UNITA rebels earlier this year has enabled relief agencies to reach hundreds of 
thousands of IDPs for the first time in many years, conflict continues in the 
other two countries. Tens of thousands in southern Sudan have been uprooted as 
a result of bombing by government forces in just the past nine months. 
<p> Fighting in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea has also uprooted tens of thousands 
in each country. Elsewhere in Africa, Burundi, where some 14,000 displaced children 
have been forcibly recruited into the army, and Uganda are believed to have about 
half a million IDPs each. 
<p> In Asia and the Pacific, more than 4.6 million people have been displaced 
by armed conflict. With an estimated 1.3 million IDPs, Indonesia is the region's 
leader, while Afghanistan, where last year's rout of the Taliban government has 
resulted in the return of more than 1.5 million refugees and the uprooting of 
tens of thousands of Pashtuns from the northern part of the country, has about 
one million IDPs, according to the Survey. 
<p> Sri Lanka, which is currently trying to negotiate an end to its 19-year-old 
civil war, also has about one million IDPs, while several hundred thousand people 
are displaced in Bangladesh, Burma, India, and the Philippines, according to the 
survey. 
<p> In the Americas, progress in reducing the number of refugees and IDPs who 
fled their war-wracked homelands in Central America in the 1980s has been overwhelmed 
by the intensification of the civil war in Colombia. With at least two million 
IDPs--USCR estimated nearly 2.5 million by the end of 2001--Colombia now ranks 
second in the world behind Sudan. The survey also noted that the number of displaced 
is increasing in Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. 
<p> In Europe, at least 3.3 million are still displaced from conflicts in 11 countries, 
most of them in the Balkans, but many also in the Caucasus region. As a result 
of progress in stabilizing the former Yugoslavia, however, the total marks a reduction 
from a high of four million in Europe a decade ago. 
<p> The Middle East has the fewest number of IDPs, 1.5 million, making it the 
only region where refugees--some six million, of whom almost four million are 
Palestinians--outnumber IDPs. Most of the IDPs in the region are Iraqis, although 
recent violence in the Israeli-occupied territories has resulted in increases 
in the number of IDPs there, the survey said.
