HAVANA  - Cuba's relations with long- time ally  Mexico reached a new low on Monday after President Fidel Castro  repeatedly called President Vicente Fox a liar, and made public  a private conversation between them to prove it.
<p>Mexico reacted swiftly, with Fox's spokesman, Rodolfo  Elizondo, decrying the playing of a recording of the two  presidents talking confidentially as "unacceptable" but saying  Mexico would maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba.<p>Castro, speaking before a national TV audience, insisted  Fox lied about the Cuban leader's hasty departure last month  from a U.N. aid summit in Monterrey, Mexico.<p>Cuba said at the time that Mexico, working on behalf of the  United States, pressured Castro to either stay away from the  summit or make himself scarce before President Bush arrived.  Mexican President Vicente Fox and Foreign Minister Jorge  Castaneda both denied pressuring Castro to leave.<p>"They were all lying left and right," Castro said.<p>The Cuban president played a tape of a private telephone  conversation he had with Fox on the eve of the summit, in which  Fox clearly urged Castro to leave the meeting early and urged  him "not to attack the United States or President Bush."<p>On the tape Fox asks Castro to make his presentation at the  summit and to return to Cuba on Thursday "so that you don't  make Friday complicated for me." Bush was scheduled to arrive  on Friday.<p>Making public the tape was a clear break with presidential  protocol. Castro said the aftermath "of telling these truths  could be that diplomatic relations are severed."<p>But Mexico did not react that strongly.<p>"Independent of anecdotes and episodes like this one, the  Mexican government will continue its diplomatic relations with  the republic of Cuba," said Elizondo, reading a statement to  reporters on Monday evening.<p>The statement criticized the lack of democracy in communist  Cuba and applauded Mexico's own democracy in words clearly  directed at Mexico's pro-Cuba opposition, which has already  criticized Fox for his handling of Castro's appearance at the  Monterrey summit.<p>CASTRO OFFERS RESIGNATION<p>Castro said he would resign from office if the conversation  proved false and challenged Fox to resign if it was not.<p>"If anyone could prove that the conversation never took  place ... I would firmly offer my resignation," Castro said.<p>Mexico has been Cuba's firmest Latin American ally since  Castro seized power in a 1959 revolution.<p>But relations have cooled in recent years with Mexico's  closer relationship with the United States and its criticism of  the human rights situation in Cuba.<p>Castro apparently held off releasing the tape until  Mexico's vote last week at the U.N. Human Rights Commission  hearings in Geneva to censure the island.<p>Castro termed the move a "despicable betrayal" as Fox had  promised him "that Mexico would never do anything against Cuba"  at the U.N. forum. Cuba has said that Mexico and other Latin  American countries voted at the behest of the U.S. government.<p>"On the contrary, Havana was the only government that put  pressure on Mexico regarding its vote in Geneva regarding the  human rights situation in Cuba," Elizondo said.<p>The motion, the first in which Latin America has taken the  lead in criticizing Cuba at the commission hearings, was  approved by 23 votes to 21, with nine abstentions.<p>Cuba has been condemned by the 53-state Commission in past  years but most Latin American countries, including Mexico, have  abstained in the votes.
