<p>Iraq has mocked America's plans for a military campaign to displace Saddam 
Hussein, saying that Washington is mistaken if it thinks the task would be a replay 
of its successful ousting of the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Baghdad, which in recent days has veered between outright defiance of the United 
States and signaling an interest in a diplomatic solution, may have been emboldened 
by the crumbling of support for American action in many European capitals.</p>
<p>In Europe, leaders such as President Jacques Chirac of France have given fresh 
voice to concerns that the US would violate international law if it took military 
action unilaterally.</p>
<p>In the US, Vice-President Dick Cheney had taken the lead in presenting America's 
case for removing President Saddam by force. He was backed by Donald Rumsfeld, 
the Defense Secretary, and President George Bush.</p>
<p>But, in Beirut yesterday, the Iraqi Vice-President, Taha Yassin Ramadan, poked 
fun at the notion that America would prevail. "We don't want to compare the two; 
Iraq is not Afghanistan," he said "I believe that the US administration is convinced 
of that."</p>
<p>Iraq's more defiant statements are primarily aimed at rallying Arab opposition 
to an American assault. Mr Ramadan added he was working with other Arab governments 
to forge a common position critical of Washington at a meeting of Arab League 
ministers next week.</p>
<p>However, Iraq also maneuvered to take advantage of growing schisms in the EU 
and even within Britain, the only likely ally of the US in the event of an attack.</p>
<p>Tony Blair faces deepening resistance within his own party to a policy of supporting 
President Bush. A recent survey showed almost two-thirds of Labour Party constituency 
leaders are strongly opposed to any such alliance between London and Washington.</p>
<p>Also notable were comments from President Chirac, who called the possibility 
of unilateral US action "worrying" France and other countries are arguing the 
US should not act without a fresh UN resolution. Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, the German 
Chancellor, urged President Bush to take note of European hesitation. "If consultations 
are meant seriously, they must not just be about the how and the when but also 
on the question of whether this is done at all," he said yesterday.</p>
<p>Vice-President Ramadan also peppered his comments this week with hints of Iraq's 
willingness to pursue a diplomatic solution. He argued that a deadlock between 
Iraq and the UN on the return to Iraq of UN weapons inspectors was being blocked 
by Washington. Iraq is seeking new talks on a return of the teams.</p>
<p>"We believe dialogue is still continuing, but the freezing and suspending of 
it, and the failure to set dates for new sessions, came as a result of pressure 
by the US administration," Mr Ramadan said.</p>
<p>However President Bush spoke on Thursday about the need to remove the Iraqi 
leader. He said: "We owe it to our children, we owe it to our grandchildren to 
make sure that the world's worst leaders do not develop and deploy the world's 
worst weapons." </p>
