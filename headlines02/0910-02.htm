<p> WASHINGTON -- Attorney General John Ashcroft was in no mood to argue in December when he strode into the Senate committee to defend the government's aggressive pursuit of real and suspected terrorists.</p>
<p>U.S. troops were still drawing fire in Afghanistan. The anthrax scare was reaching an apex, and the nation remained badly shaken by the events of Sept. 11. People were afraid to fly. Some refused to open their mail, and others nervously avoided the top floors of even modest-sized buildings. </p>

</table>He had no time for suggestions that the government had gone too far, that its aggressive detention of witnesses, the widespread use of secret deportation hearings, wiretaps and the authorization of military tribunals had eroded the civil liberties that Americans cherished.</p>
<p>"Our legal powers are targeted at terrorists," he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that day. "To those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve."</p>
<p>That was then. Today, the proper balance between civil liberties and security is anything but clear. And despite Ashcroft's threatening tone, the debate is only getting louder and sharper.</p>
<p>Civil libertarians, elected officials and even federal judges have begun asking piercing and persistent questions about an assortment of new law enforcement tools that have been used since Sept. 11, from the caves of Tora Bora to local public libraries.</p>
<p>The reach of the government has been felt nationwide. In Seattle, in March, the U.S. Agriculture Department notified the owners of three small grocery stores that serve Somali immigrants that it was revoking their authority to accept food stamps. </p>
<p>Treasury and FBI agents earlier had raided a money-wiring service housed in the same building as one of the groceries for possible links to terrorism. Although unrelated to that business, the agents stripped bare the shelves. Some  goods were later returned to the store's owner, but much was destroyed.</p>
<p>The government eventually admitted that it was a mistake and restored the food stamp privileges as well as restitution. But the damage was done.</p>
<p>"Ninety-nine percent of my customers used food stamps. . . . Today I have no business," Yasin Jama, the store's owner, said at the time. "I can't pay rent; I can't pay electricity."</p>
<p>Jama hopes to rebuild his once thriving business. But the memory is bitter.</p>
<p>"These people were never given a chance. They were targeted because of their country of origin," said Susan Foster, the Seattle attorney who represented Jama.</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident, James Ujaama, a former Seattle resident who had been celebrated for his civic work, was detained because of suspected links to al-Qaida and held for more than a month without charges in Virginia by federal authorities. He ultimately was indicted last month on charges of providing material support to terrorists. He maintains his innocence. </p>
<p>There are thousands more who have been caught in the shifting priorities that have emerged since Sept. 11. Most, including hundreds living in the Seattle area, have nothing to do with terrorism and involve routine immigration issues such as visa requests. Yet the processing of those requests have largely ground to a halt since the attack. Aides to members of Congress from Washington state say that it's almost impossible to secure a visa for people from central Asia.</p>
<p>President Bush and his senior advisers, led by Ashcroft, insist that new tools are needed to find and conquer a new enemy. Those methods must be used even if they bump up against traditional notions of liberty and the bounds of the Constitution, Ashcroft says.</p>
<p>"Since those first terrible hours of Sept. 11, America has faced a choice that is as stark as the images that linger of that morning," Ashcroft said in December.</p>
<p>"One option is to call Sept. 11 a fluke, to believe it could never happen again, and to live in a dream world that requires us to do nothing differently. The other option is to fight back, to summon all our strength and all our resources and devote ourselves to better ways to identify, disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks."</p>
<p>An inventory of the new police powers made available to federal authorities since Sept. 11 is indeed thick. Congress approved many of the powers only a month after the attack when it passed the USA Patriot Act. The 342-page anti-terrorism bill was largely written behind closed doors and delivered much of what the administration requested.</p>
<p>In general, the law is designed to make it easier for law enforcement to track Internet communications, detain suspected terrorists and obtain nationwide warrants for searches and eavesdropping.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has since imposed other legal changes without congressional consent, such as allowing federal agents to monitor attorney-client conversations in federal prisons and encouraging bureaucrats to deny public access to many documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act. Rules were also developed that allow federal agents to find out what books people have checked out of a library or bought from a store.</p>
<p>The FBI can monitor political and religious meetings inside the United States now, even when there is no suspicion a crime has been committed -- a policy abandoned in the 1970s amid outrage over J. Edgar Hoover's surveillance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other activists.</p>
<p>The Bush administration still hopes to create Operation TIPS, which would rely on "regular citizens" to watch their neighborhoods and report suspicious activity. The idea has been sharply criticized. The Customs Service  continues to publicly support the use of a national ID card to more easily track immigrants and foreign visitors. </p>
<p>Critics, including members of Congress, groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and a handful of federal judges, say the government has gone too far, has become too secretive and is threatening the core constitutional rights that define America.</p>
<p>"I'd have to say that Bush's and Ashcroft's commitment to democracy should be seriously questioned," said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., one of the loudest critics of the tactics federal officials are using to dismantle terrorist threats. "Their approach seems to be, let's round everybody up and sort out the details later. . . . I don't think the threat is the least bit vague for anybody of color or people of the Muslim faith, and I consider John Ashcroft the most dangerous man in America."</p>
<p>Much of the activity the government has undertaken since Sept. 11 has been shrouded in secrecy, shielded from public view by law enforcement agencies or in courtrooms closed to the public.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has ordered most of the cases closed to public view. That practice, however, was weakened Aug. 26, when a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that deportation cases must be open to the public.</p>
<p>"A government operating in the shadow of secrecy stands in complete opposition to the society envisioned by the framers of our Constitution," Court of Appeals Judge Damon Keith wrote in the panel's decision.</p>
<p>Critics are seizing on that ruling and others, such an order issued last month by U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler directing the government to make public the names of all those  swept up in the Sept. 11 investigation. </p>
<p>"Secret arrests are a concept odious to a democratic society," Kessler wrote. Her order is on hold during an appeal brought by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>But there are strong advocates as well, both in Congress and in the courts. And opinion polls show that the public largely supports giving law enforcement new powers to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of checks and balances," said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee who helped write the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>In fact, Hatch says, it should have been more sweeping. "We have tremendous protection for privacy, civil rights, individual liberties. They are not going by the boards just because we have the Patriot Act. We understand the protection of the American people is on the line here."</p>
<p>As far as Hatch is concerned, the critics are missing the point. Those who voice concerns "are a lot of leftist groups who don't like any kind of law enforcement protection, intelligence protection. They don't trust government. </p>
<p>"We think those protections are still in existence, and we're providing law enforcement the tools to be able to protect our people from terrorist attacks and incidents. To me, that's a pretty good balance," he said.</p>
<p>The arguments  are not new, of course. The United States has typically taken wartime steps to guard national security while incidentally infringing on the rights of individuals. For instance, President Lincoln famously suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War, thus allowing Confederate sympathizers to be held for extended periods without court appearances. And during World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt approved the confinement of Japanese Americans in internment camps.</p>
<p>Measures taken by the Bush administration are not so dramatic. But groups and individuals across the political spectrum are raising concerns that the government is unnecessarily limiting civil liberties. </p>
<p>"What has happened in the past should be a reminder to us that we need to stop some of these activities so we don't have to apologize for them later," said Gregory Nojeim, assistant director of the ACLU's Washington, D.C. office.</p>
<p>"The battle in Afghanistan is largely won, but there is no end in sight to the battle over the Constitution," the ACLU says in an analysis of the government's powers.</p>
<p>"But while the loss of liberty is apparent, there is surprisingly little evidence that the new powers will actually enhance security," the ACLU analysis says.</p>
