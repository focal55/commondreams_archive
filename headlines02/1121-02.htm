<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;A massive database that the government will use

the war on terror, the Pentagon said Wednesday.</p>

"The bottom line is this is an important research project to determine the feasibility 
of using certain transactions and events to discover and respond to terrorists 
before they act," he said.</p> 
<p>Aldridge said the database, which he called another "tool" in the war on terror, 
would look for telltale signs of suspicious consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Examples he cited were: sudden and large cash withdrawals, one-way air or rail 
travel, rental car transactions and purchases of firearms, chemicals or agents 
that could be used to produce biological or chemical weapons.</p>
<p>It would also combine consumer information with visa records, passports, arrest 
records or reports of suspicious activity given to law enforcement or intelligence 
services.</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is home to the Pentagon's brightest 
thinkers -- the ones who built the Internet. DARPA will be in charge of trying 
to make the system work technically.</p>
<p>Rear Adm. John Poindexter, former national security adviser to President Reagan, 
is developing the database under the Total Information Awareness Program. Poindexter 
was convicted on five counts of misleading Congress and making false statements 
during the Iran-Contra investigation. Those convictions were later overturned, 
but critics note that his is a dubious resume for someone entrusted with so sensitive 
a task.</p>
<p>Aldridge said Poindexter will only "develop the tool, he will not be exercising 
the tool." He said Poindexter brought the database idea to the Pentagon and persuaded 
Aldridge and others to pursue it.</p>
<p>"John has a real passion for this project," Aldridge said.</p>
<p>TIAF's office logo is now one eye scanning the globe. The translation of the 
Latin motto: knowledge is power. Some say, possibly too much power. "What this 
is talking about is making us a nation of suspects and I am sorry, the United 
States citizens should not have to live in fear of their own government and that 
is exactly what this is going to turn out to be," said Chuck Pena, senior defense 
policy analyst at the Cato Institute.</p>
<p>Pena and others say the database is an even greater violation of privacy rights 
than Attorney General John Ashcroft's nixed proposal to turn postal workers and 
delivery men into government tipsters. No matter what protections Congress requires, 
Pena fears a database big enough and nimble enough to track the entire nation's 
spending habits is ripe for abuse.</p>
<p>"I don't think once you put something like this in place, you can ever create 
enough checks and balances and oversight," Pena said.</p>
<p>But proponents say big business already has access to most of this data, but 
don't do anything with it to fight terrorism.</p>
<p>"I find it somewhat counter intuitive that people are not concerned that telemarketers 
and insurance companies can acquire this data but feel tremendous trepidation 
if a government ventures into this arena. To me it just smacks of paranoia," said 
David Rivkin, an&#160;attorney for Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP.</p>
<p>The database is not yet ready and Aldridge said it will not be available for 
several years. Fake consumer data will be used in development of the database, 
he said.</p>
<p>When it's ready, Aldridge said individual privacy rights will be protected. 
But he could not explain how the data would be accessed. In some cases, specific 
warrants would give law enforcement agencies access, he said. But in other cases 
the database might flag suspicious activity absent a specific request or warrant, 
and that suspicious activity could well be relayed to law enforcement or intelligence 
agencies.</p>
<p>"I don't know what the scope of this is going to be," Aldridge said. "We are 
in a war on terrorism. We are trying to find out if this technology can work."</p>
