</font>The numbers of adelie penguins on the Antarctic peninsula &#150; the most 
northerly part of the frozen continent &#150; are falling as global warming takes 
hold. And experts predict that, as the climate change continues, they may abandon 
much of the 900-mile-long promontory altogether.
<p>The archetypal &quot;tuxedoed&quot; species like the cold even more than other 
penguins. And the peninsula has been warming up faster than almost anywhere else 
on earth, with temperatures increasing at least five times faster than the world 
average. Scientists believe this is disrupting their food supplies.</p>
<p>Global warming is also causing them grief in another of their strongholds, 
the Ross Sea. Two giant icebergs have broken off the Antarctic ice sheet and are 
blocking the way from their breeding colonies to their feeding areas. As a result 
they have to walk 30 miles further to get food &#150; no small matter when they 
can manage only one mile per hour. And, on the other side of the continent, thousands 
of emperor penguin chicks drowned near Britain's Halley base after the ice broke 
up early, before they had learned to swim.</p>
<p>Like miners' canaries, the dinner-jacketed penguins of Antarctica are providing 
an early warning of danger to come. For global warming is heating up the frozen 
continent faster than the rest of the world, and the penguins are among the first 
to feel the effects.</p>
<p>Flightless, and so unable to escape like other birds, they are affected by 
what happens both on land and sea. And, because they are easy to spot and count, 
they provide an early indication of what may be happening to other species.</p>
<p>They are feeling the heat most strongly on the Antarctic peninsula, which juts 
out from the polar land mass towards South America. Studies of air temperatures 
around the world over the past half-century suggest that this is one of the three 
areas on the planet &#150; along with north-western North America and part of 
Siberia &#150; warming up fastest. The British Antarctic Survey says flowering 
plants have spread rapidly in the area, glaciers are retreating, and seven huge 
ice sheets have melted away.</p>
<p>As the peninsula has warmed up, the numbers of adelie penguins have been dropping. 
Scientists suspect that the rising temperatures affect the small fish and other 
marine animals on which they feed, though they are not yet sure how.</p>
<p>Professor Steven Emslie, of the University of North Carolina, believes that 
if the warming goes on the penguins &quot;would continue to decline in the peninsula, 
and may completely abandon much of it&quot;. Studies of fossilized remains that 
he has carried out near Britain's Rothera base show that the numbers of the penguins 
have sharply declined during warmer periods in prehistory.</p>
<p>On at least one occasion, the decline in the peninsula was marked by a rapid 
increase in the penguins in the Ross Sea more than 2,000 miles away. But in recent 
months global warming has been causing them trouble there too. Researchers for 
the US National Science Foundation said that one colony of adelies at Cape Royds 
will &quot;fail totally&quot; this year. And scientists at the Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography add that a colony of emperor penguins at Cape Crozier has also 
failed to raise any chicks.</p>
<p>Global warming also threatens the food supplies of emperor penguins. When there 
is less ice in the sea, populations of krill &#150; a staple in their diet &#150; 
fall.</p>
<p>Despite all this, penguins are not in danger of extinction; there are millions 
of them still in Antarctica and one species &#150; the chinstrap penguin &#150; 
seems to be thriving in the warmer weather. But they still provide a warning. 
In the words of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the world's 
leading conservation body: &quot;Things happening to penguins are a foretaste 
of things to come.&quot; </p>
