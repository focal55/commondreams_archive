<p>GENOA, Italy - Tens of thousands took to the streets of Genoa on Saturday to 
remember the "martyr" of the anti-globalization movement, a protester shot dead 
by police during last year's meeting of the Group of Eight leaders.
<p>Carlo Giuliani, 23, was killed during violent clashes  between police and demonstrators that left another 300 injured  and prompted widespread accusations of police brutality.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

</table></font>On the first anniversary of the Genoa G8 summit, police  said about 60,000 activists and well-wishers converged on the  northern Italian city to honor the memory of Giuliani and to  inject fresh energy into the anti-globalization movement.<p>At 5:27 p.m., the time that Giuliani was shot by a young  policeman as he tried to throw a fire extinguisher into a  paramilitary police jeep, the crowds broke into a prolonged  cheer and released hundreds of colored balloons into the sky.<p>"This is not a funeral. We wanted to have a celebration of  life, of the right to live and of so many rights that are  denied in the world and in Italy," Giuliani's father said in  the piazza where his son was shot.<p>All day, demonstrators streamed through the square, leaving  flowers and messages at a makeshift altar to their martyr. In  the early evening, thousands marched peacefully through the  city waving red flags.<p>Organizers said up to 100,000 people had turned out for a  main march and other demonstrations, but police put the figure  closer to 60,000 -- still twice as big as expected.<p>HAUNTING IMAGES<p>For many, the Genoa G8, which drew some 250,000 protesters,  marked a high point in the grassroots movement that started at  the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999.<p>But it was the violence and the images of Giuliani's  blood-stained body lying in the square where he was killed that  grabbed most headlines.<p>During the summit, rioters caused widespread damage to the  city, torching cars, smashing shop windows and raining bottles  and petrol bombs onto ill-prepared police lines.<p>According to witness statements gathered by Amnesty  International, police reacted with extreme violence, beating  and kicking protesters and depriving those arrested of prompt  medical treatment.<p>Human rights groups have slammed the government for failing  to address the police brutality, but the clashes and the  anti-globalization movement itself have been partly forgotten  since the September 11 attacks on the United States.<p>Still, Genoa's mayhem prompted world leaders to shift later  summits to remote, well-protected locations.<p>A year after Genoa, activists said Saturday's huge turnout  showed the anti-globalization movement was alive and well.<p>The mood was cheerful as balloons and jugglers filled the  piazzas and the day ended with concerts, dancing and drinking.<p>There were a few tense moments between protesters and some  of the 3,000 police on hand, but no violence was reported.<p>"Carlo (Giuliani) is alive and fighting alongside us. Our  ideas won't die," said Vittorio Agnoletto, Italy's leading  anti-globalization activist.</span>
