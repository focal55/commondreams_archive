<p> <i> Donald Rumfeld's public image as a sharp, in-charge secretary of defense 
is a far cry from how he's perceived among Pentagon insiders. They describe Rumsfeld 
as often abusive, indecisive and accessible only to a small 'palace guard' of 
loyal advisers.</i>
<p> WASHINGTON &#151; When Marine Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold was preparing this 
year to leave his position as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
his boss, Gen. Richard Myers, nominated an Air Force officer to succeed him. 
<p> But when Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld of his choice for the next director of operations &#151; or "J-3," one 
of the most important jobs in the U.S. military &#151; he received a rude surprise. 
<p> Not so fast, said Rumsfeld, who in a sharp departure from previous practice 
personally interviews all nominees for three-star and four-star positions in the 
military. Give me someone else, Rumsfeld told Myers after twice interviewing the 
nominee, Lt. Gen. Ronald Keys. 
<p> Myers came up with a selection more to Rumsfeld's liking, Air Force Lt. Gen. 
Norton Schwartz &#151; ending a long-standing practice of the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs naming his top subordinates. 
<p> Senior military officers now recount Keys' demise to illustrate a pronounced 
civilian-military divide at the Pentagon under Rumsfeld's leadership. Numerous 
officers complain bitterly that their best advice is being disregarded by someone 
who has spent most of the past 25 years away from the military. Rumsfeld first 
served as defense secretary from 1975 to 1977, in the Ford administration.
<p> <b>Top brass frustrated</b> 
<p> Nearly two dozen current and former top officers and civilian officials interviewed 
said there is a huge discrepancy between the outside perception of Rumsfeld &#151; 
the crisp, no-nonsense defense secretary who became a media star through his briefings 
on the Afghan war &#151; and how he is seen inside the Pentagon. 
<p> Many senior officers on the Joint Staff and in all branches of the military 
describe Rumsfeld as frequently abusive and indecisive, trusting only a tiny circle 
of close advisers, seemingly eager to slap down officers with decades of distinguished 
service. The unhappiness is so pervasive that all three service secretaries are 
said to be deeply frustrated by a lack of autonomy and contemplating leaving by 
the end of the year. 
<p> Rumsfeld declined to be interviewed for this article. 
<p> His disputes with parts of the top brass involve style, the conduct of military 
operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and sharply different views about how 
and whether to "transform" today's armed forces. But what the fights boil down 
to is civilian control of a defense establishment that Rumsfeld is said to believe 
had become too independent and risk-averse during eight years under President 
Clinton. 
<p> What makes this more than a bureaucratic dispute, however, is that it is influencing 
the Pentagon's internal debate over a possible invasion of Iraq. Some officers 
question whether their concerns about the dangers of urban warfare and other aspects 
of a potential conflict are being sufficiently weighed &#151; or dismissed as 
typical military risk aversion.
<p> <b>Billion-dollar plans in doubt</b> 
<p> The dispute also promises to have a big impact in the coming year on the fate 
of hugely expensive weapons systems. Stephen Cambone, a top Rumsfeld deputy, is 
recommending more than $10 billion in savings by cutting or delaying the Air Force's 
F-22 stealth fighter, the Navy's next-generation aircraft carrier, and three Army 
programs: the Comanche reconnaissance helicopter, the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle 
and the Future Combat System.
<p> These tensions were straining relations between the uniformed military and 
Rumsfeld before Sept. 11, 2001, but were partially submerged by the Afghan war 
and other counterattacks on terrorism. They have re-emerged as the Pentagon plans 
for possible war in the Persian Gulf and for a fiscal 2004 budget that is in danger 
of being swamped by war costs and long-deferred expenditures on modernization, 
new weapons and Rumsfeld's desire to transform the military into a 21st-century 
force.
<p> "There is a nearly universal feeling among the officer corps that the inner 
circle is closed, not tolerant of ideas it doesn't already share, and determined 
to impose its ideas, regardless of military doubts," said Loren Thompson, a defense 
analyst at the Lexington Institute with close ties to defense contractors and 
the military.
<p> "All of the bad blood of last year is coming back in a very big way," one 
former Pentagon official said.
<p> <b>'Palace guard' resented</b> 
<p> All three service secretaries were recruited from private industry to bring 
"best business practices" to the Pentagon and promised autonomy in making management 
reforms. But all three find their actions constrained by Rumsfeld and what is 
referred to as his small "palace guard," according to Pentagon insiders. 
<p> Air Force Secretary James Roche has thought he lacked input on decisions about 
the service's centerpiece program, the F-22, senior officers and defense contractors 
say. Navy Secretary Gordon England has expressed interest in a top job at the 
proposed Homeland Security Department. Army Secretary Thomas White, a former executive 
at Enron Corp., has been tarnished by the Enron scandal, his failure to promptly 
divest his Enron holdings, and controversy over his use of Army aircraft for personal 
business. 
<p> It's an ironic position for an administration that came to office promising 
new respect for the military. In Congress and elsewhere in Washington, some now 
question whether the military feels free to give its best advice to the administration 
&#151; or whether that advice is welcomed. 
<p> "I've heard repeatedly about the lack of trust between the secretary and the 
uniformed officers," said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., a member of the Armed Services 
Committee and a former Army officer. "That, I think, is a problem," particularly 
with a possible invasion of Iraq, he added. 
<p> "If there is an atmosphere where contrary views aren't well-received, you 
may move into an operation that isn't well-advised," a three-star officer warned.
<p> <b>Views welcomed, some say</b> 
<p> Myers, in an interview, denied that he or other senior officers feel constrained 
in speaking their mind to Rumsfeld. 
<p> "It has never been easier to express our opinion, our thoughts, with any secretary," 
Myers said. "There is ample opportunity, in fact, encouragement, to present other 
views and disagree." 
<p> Victoria Clarke, Rumsfeld's spokeswoman, cited a series of "spectacular accomplishments" 
at the Pentagon: a new defense strategy, a nuclear posture review, a restructured 
missile-defense program, far more realistic budgeting procedures, and an ambitious 
agenda for "transforming" the military. Those couldn't have happened without close 
civilian-military relations, she said. 
<p> "It's extraordinary that those things got done, in the face of amazing resistance 
to change, at the same time we were prosecuting the war on terrorism," Clarke 
said. Rumsfeld "not only welcomes, but encourages, dissent." 
<p> While issues of great substance lie at the heart of Rumsfeld's unsettled relationship 
with the military, discussion of the Pentagon's current environment invariably 
begins with assessments of Rumsfeld's powerful personal style. 
<p> Even his detractors admit he is a man of considerable energy and intellect 
who is pushing the right issues and raising many of the right questions. Rumsfeld, 
70, is universally praised for his handling of the war in Afghanistan, where he 
and other Bush Cabinet members insisted on a bold plan for toppling the Taliban 
and driving al-Qaida out of the country. 
<p> What appears at times to be indecisiveness on Rumsfeld's part, according to 
one senior officer, stems from his deep personal involvement in operational planning.
<p> <b>Rumsfeld's agenda</b> 
<p> It has become a truism in national-security circles that Rumsfeld has been 
a better secretary of war than secretary of defense. Rumsfeld has two dominant 
priorities. The first is reshaping the U.S. military from a heavy, industrial-age 
force designed in the Cold War to an agile, information-age force capable of defeating 
more elusive adversaries anywhere on the globe. 
<p> Rumsfeld's second priority, about which he has been less open, is reasserting 
civilian control over a military establishment that had grown autonomous &#151; 
and, many believe, too cautious &#151; during the Clinton years. Throughout the 
war on terrorism, Rumsfeld has pushed for bolder plans from the military. Under 
his stewardship, war planning has become far more effective and imaginative, said 
a former official who otherwise is critical of Rumsfeld. 
<p> "This guy really is trying to get (the Pentagon) to work for him," one former 
defense official said. "I don't think he's chosen the right path. But it's not 
a question of him being the devil and everyone else is a misunderstood angel." 
<p> If Rumsfeld returned to the Pentagon in January 2001 predisposed to see senior 
military officers as dull and uncreative, as many believe, he has since shown 
a willingness to reassess their capability. Some officers say relations between 
his office and the uniformed branches have improved as both sides have learned 
to better interact. 
<p> "Rumsfeld has changed over time. He's still cantankerous, but he's not necessarily 
as combative as he was at one point in time," one three-star officer said.
<p> <b>'Courting a rebellion'</b> 
<p> Others are far more pessimistic. "Things are more fouled up (at the Pentagon) 
than I've ever seen them," said one former defense official sympathetic to Rumsfeld. 
<p> "The depth of disaffection is really quite striking," added a defense consultant. 
"I think Rumsfeld is courting a rebellion." 
<p> Rumsfeld's primary objective in reasserting civilian control over the Pentagon 
has been in reining in the Joint Staff, an umbrella organization of about 1,200 
personnel, drawn from all four services, that is crucial in overseeing daily military 
activities worldwide. 
<p> The staff works for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Rumsfeld 
has made it clear that in his Pentagon, the chairman works for him.
<p> People who have dealt with him over the last two years said Rumsfeld saw the 
Joint Staff as sometimes unresponsive to civilian leadership. He wasn't alone, 
recalled one officer at the Pentagon, who said Joint Staff officers sometimes 
seemed to think that "the suits don't need to know this." 
<p> Under Rumsfeld, the civilians are no longer cut out. 
<p> Rumsfeld tried to gain control over the key position of director of the Joint 
Staff, the person who helps determine the daily agenda of the U.S. military leadership, 
backing down when his move to oust the incumbent met opposition. But he made the 
point that the defense secretary would be intimately involved in deciding who 
filled the top positions. And he prevailed when it came time this year to replace 
Gen. Newbold.
<p> <b>Chairman says he has say</b> 
<p> Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has been criticized by generals who think 
he has failed to stand up to Rumsfeld. But Myers said such complaints are from 
officers who don't understand his close relationships with Rumsfeld, Deputy Defense 
Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs. He also said that "if I didn't feel like I had my say to my boss and had 
an opportunity to be influential, I wouldn't be here."
<p> Rumsfeld is now working to strip the Joint Staff of a series of its offices 
&#151; legislative liaison, legal counsel and public affairs. These have given 
the military leadership a degree of autonomy by providing it direct pipelines 
to Congress, to other parts of the government and to the media.
<p> Clarke, Rumsfeld's spokeswoman, denied Rumsfeld has singled out the Joint 
Staff in an attempt to diminish its power. 
<p> "The secretary thinks the entire department, civilian and military, was lethargic, 
bureaucratic, not fully addressing the dramatically changed world in which we 
find ourselves," she said. "And he has appropriately lit fires under everybody 
and said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, the stakes around here are very high.' And some 
people respond well to that, and some people don't."
