<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Israeli troops raided a big refugee camp on the edge of Bethlehem early this morning as Israel expanded its military offensive across the West Bank against a backdrop of continued suicide bombings and a rising tide of international criticism. 
<P>The push into Deheisheh and a reported helicopter missile attack on a second nearby camp, Aida, came after Israeli tanks massed on the edges of Bethlehem in the south and the city of Nablus in the north.  
<P>Israeli forces were also storming the headquarters of Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, he told Reuters news agency by telephone early this morning.  
<P>Mr Rajoub said 400 Palestinians were sheltering in his offices in Beitunia, near the Palestinian capital, Ramallah. He said they would not surrender and if Israeli troops broke through "there would be a massacre". Israeli military sources accused him of sheltering militants wanted for masterminding bombings.  
<P>In Washington, however, President George Bush refused to condemn the Israeli operations, repeating earlier observations that the Jewish state had a right to defend itself, and only calling on the prime minister, Ariel Sharon "to keep the path of peace open".  
<P>Instead, Mr Bush put the onus for curbing the violence on Yasser Arafat, who spent a fourth day under Israeli siege without running water or telephones in the ruins of his Ramallah headquarters.  
<P>"There will never be peace so long as there is terror. I'd like to see Chairman Arafat denounce the terror," he said.  
<P>In an ominous sign, Iranian-backed Hizbullah guerrillas in Lebanon fired a Katyusha rocket into Israel early today,   Israeli security sources said.  
<P>They said at least one rocket struck the Upper Galilee region. An army spokeswoman said no one was hurt in the attack. It was the first reported Katyusha strike since the Israeli army withdrew from Lebanon in May 2000.  
<P>In the West Bank, Israeli troops occupied the center of Qalqiliya, launching house to house searches, and tanks advanced towards Manger Square in Bethlehem before retreating to the edge of the town later in the day.  
<P>Palestinian security officials said tanks entered the perimeters of a fourth West Bank town, Tulkaram.  
<P>In Jerusalem, a suicide bomber struck yesterday, in the sixth attack in six days, blowing himself up and critically wounding a policeman who had stopped his car. Two other people were also injured.  
<P>The widening offensive in the West Bank arrived amid mounting pressure on Israel to lift its siege of Mr Arafat and to withdraw from the West Bank. Yesterday, the 57-member Organization of Islamic Conference in Kuala Lumpur passed a unanimous resolution accusing Israel of "dragging the region toward an all-out war" and calling for UN sanctions.  
<P>In Ramallah, Israeli troops deepened Mr Arafat's isolation, heaping rubble on roads leading to his compound, and upending cars as barricades.  
<P>In the rest of the city, the sense of siege deepened. Helicopters clattered overhead and tanks and anti-aircraft guns bombarded an office building in which Palestinian policemen were trapped.  
<P>The Israeli army said it had arrested 700 Palestinians in Ramallah since Friday.  
<P>The US response appeared confused. Though Mr Bush reaffirmed Washington's support for the Israeli offensive, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, insisted that the absence of any rebuke to Mr Sharon did not amount to a "green light" for his actions. "The Israelis did not seek a green light," he said.  
<P>Within Israel there was growing disquiet. The Knesset, or parliament, refused to sanction his call-up of 20,000 reservists, referring the matter to a debate on Thursday.  
<P>As the tanks advanced, Palestinians shot dead about 10 men suspected of collaborating with Israel. Seven were grabbed from a makeshift jail in Tulkaram by masked gunmen of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a military offshoot of Mr Arafat's Fatah organization. Two were killed by their jailers in Qalqiliya. </p>
