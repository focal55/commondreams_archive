<p>WASHINGTON - 
After a Senate panel voted to issue subpoenas Wednesday, the White House turned over summaries of dozens of contacts between Bush administration officials and Enron executives.</p>
<p>
No instance has been found so far of Enron officials asking anyone in the White House for help before Enron's bankruptcy last December, the White House said.</p>
<p>
The summaries were provided to the Governmental Affairs Committee hours after it voted to issue Congress' first subpoenas to the Bush White House. The vote was 9-8, along party lines, and some Republicans accused majority Democrats of having political motives.</p>
<p>
The panel decided to subpoena President Bush's executive office and Vice President Dick Cheney's office to compel officials to produce relevant documents by noon June 3. The material being sought dates from January 1992, also covering the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>
Many of the contacts described in the material provided Wednesday were disclosed by the administration early this year when the Enron scandal broke, in response to questions from lawmakers and reporters.</p>
<p>
They include a half-hour private meeting on April 17, 2001, that then-Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay had with Cheney, in which energy policy and the power crisis in California were discussed. Cheney, who headed an energy-policy task force, disclosed the meeting in a PBS television documentary earlier this year.</p>
<p>
Cheney also has disclosed similar meetings with Enron officials in February, March, April, August and October of last year.</p>
<p>
"Our inquiries thus far have disclosed no instance in which Enron approached any person within ... (Bush or Cheney's office) seeking help in connection with its financial difficulties prior to bankruptcy," White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales said in a letter accompanying the material.</p>
<p>
There were numerous telephone calls from top Enron officials to Bush Cabinet officials last fall before the bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the committee chairman, was not satisfied with the material provided Wednesday because it appeared to be incomplete, said Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips.</p>
<p>
"It appears the White House is still providing only what it thinks is relevant rather than what the committee asked for," Phillips said. She said the White House still hasn't given Lieberman the assurance he was seeking that it would provide all the material requested by the end of the month.</p>
<p>
Presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer, traveling with Bush to Germany on Air Force One, said the subpoenas were unnecessary because the White House was providing material.</p>
<p>
Houston-based Enron Corp., which entered the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history in December, has been among Bush's biggest campaign contributors.</p>
<p>
With the collapse of the energy-trading company, one of the nation's largest corporations, investors nationwide were burned, and thousands of Enron employees were stripped of nearly all their retirement assets as the company's stock plummeted.</p>
<p>
The Senate panel's vote followed a two-hour debate that at times turned bitterly partisan. Some Republican senators accused Lieberman of political grandstanding in forcing the White House to turn over material without any allegations of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>
"Are we doing this to attract the attention of the public?" asked Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. "It makes me very suspicious about the motivation of asking for a subpoena."</p>
<p>
Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate in 2000 and a potential presidential candidate in 2004, has been seeking the material from the White House since late March, with much push-and-pull between the two sides. He bristled at Cochran's suggestion of political motivation and insisted that the White House has failed to give him assurances that it would provide all the material requested by the end of this month.</p>
<p>
A particular point of contention is White House material related to potential presidential appointments of individuals to government positions.</p>
<p>
Lieberman said the information from the White House, as the lead "formulator and coordinator" of federal policy, is needed in the committee's inquiry into why federal regulators did not discover Enron's questionable business practices and intervene.</p>
<p>
"The clear message I've gotten from the White House is that they're not going to give us what we want," Lieberman said. "I have finally concluded that we were being slow-walked ... at the least and stonewalled at worst."</p>
<p>
"No White House can be immune from congressional oversight. We are, after all, the people's representatives here," he declared.</p>
<p>
"The White House has cooperated with Sen. Lieberman," Fleischer told reporters. He said the White House's own review showed "no instance in which Enron approached anyone in the executive office of the president for financial help before they filed for bankruptcy."</p>
<p>
The Bush administration disclosed in January that former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay made a series of telephone calls to members of the Bush Cabinet, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, as the company spiraled toward collapse last fall.</p>
<p>
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, sued Cheney in February to force release of the names of figures from Enron and other companies in the oil industry who met last year with the vice president's energy task force.</p>
