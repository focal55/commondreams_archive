            The Enron affair exploded around the Bush Presidency last night, as 
            his administration's top legal officer was forced to remove himself 
            from the newly launched criminal investigation &#173; and the accounting 
            firm that audited the failed energy giant's books admitted it had 
            destroyed thousands of documents relating to the case.
            <p> Yesterday, the White House shifted into full scandal defense mode. Mr Bush 
              intervened in the affair directly for the first time, ordering the 
              Treasury Department to review federal pension regulations. He also 
              denied he had ever discussed the company's difficulties with Kenneth 
              Lay, Enron's chairman and a long time friend and benefactor of the 
              President. </p>

            An especially shocking aspect of the Enron d&eacute;bacle has been 
            the way in which senior executives were able to cash in up to $1bn 
            (&#163;700m) of Enron stock and options in the 18 months before the 
            company began to unravel last autumn &#173; while many employees, 
            obliged to hold stock in pensions schemes, saw retirement funds virtually 
            wiped out. 
            <p> Already, civil suits have been filed against 29 Enron directors 
              and senior executives, charging they sold shares while knowing the 
              company was in dire trouble. The Justice Department investigation 
              will examine whether Enron, in the last few years, was no more than 
              a giant fraud. </p>
            <p> It was disclosure of unreported debts shielded by secret partnerships 
              run by senior Enron executives, and its October admission that it 
              had overstated its profits by $586m in the previous four years that 
              created the crisis of investor confidence that drove Enron into 
              bankruptcy at the start of December. In the process, what was once 
              the seventh-largest US corporation saw its shares plunge from $85 
              to under $1 apiece, in the largest corporate collapse in US financial 
              history. </p>
            <p> Last night, Arthur Andersen, Enron's accountants stunned the US 
              financial community by revealing its employees had destroyed a "significant" 
              number of paper and electronic documents relating to its audit had 
              been destroyed. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street's 
              top regulatory body, described the admission as an "extremely serious 
              matter". </p>
            <p> In a separate embarrassment for Mr Bush, Attorney General John 
              Ashcroft, head of the Justice Department and thus the country's 
              top law enforcement official, announced he would have no involvement 
              in the investigation. Mr Ashcroft reportedly accepted up to $60,000 
              to help his failed 2000 Senate campaign. </p>
            <p> In the short term, the probe could take some of the sting out 
              of the Congressional hearings due to start next month into the collapse. 
              Scheduled witnesses, including Mr Lay and other senior executives, 
              are likely to be the object of the federal investigation and under 
              threat of criminal indictment, they may be able to say little to 
              interrogators on Capitol Hill. </p>
            <p> Even so, the once-close relationship between Mr Lay and the President 
              will come under ever-fiercer scrutiny. Denying he had ever discussed 
              Enron's finances with Mr Lay, Mr Bush said had not seen him since 
              last May. He expressed "great concern" for the people who had entrusted 
              their money to Enron, and then "for whatever reason, based upon 
              some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy." 
            </p>
            <p> The real target for Democrats will be the large political donations 
              Enron made to the Republican party, including more than $100,000 
              to Mr Bush's election campaign, and a similar contribution to the 
              2001 inauguration gala.</p>
