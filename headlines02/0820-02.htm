<p> WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Colin Powell will lead the American delegation 
to the <a href="http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/" target="_new">World Summit 
on Sustainable Development</a>, to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa from 
August 26 through September 4. President George W. Bush made the announcement 
late Monday, giving no explanation as to why he will not be attending the summit 
to join 106 other world leaders on the speaker's podium.

</table></font>Secretary Powell will be joined by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator 
Christie Todd Whitman, Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality James 
Connaughton, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Andrew Natsios, 
and Under Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky, the President said. 
<p> The World Summit on Sustainable Development is sponsored by the United Nations 
as a 10 year follow up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which was attended 
by then President George H.W. Bush, father of the current President. 
<p> Other heads of government and heads of state who are on the speakers list 
in Johannesburg include all the other leaders of G8 countries - UK Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, 
Italian President Silvio Berlusconi and Russia's Vladimir Putin among them. 
<p> President Bush has been under pressure from Republican Party and conservative 
lobbyists not to attend the summit. 
<p> A letter to Bush made public Friday by Friends of the Earth UK shows the nature 
of that pressure. Dated August 2, the letter is signed by 31 political groups 
and individuals. It says "We applaud your decision not to attend the summit in 
person." 
<p> "Even more than the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992," the letter says, "the Johannesburg 
Summit will provide a global media stage for many of the most irresponsible and 
destructive elements involved in critical international economic and environmental 
issues. Your presence would only help to publicize and make more credible various 
anti-freedom, anti-people, anti-globalization, and anti-Western agendas." 
<p> Signatories to the letter include representatives of seven think tanks that 
receive funding from oil giant ExxonMobil, according to figures in an official 
Exxon document. 
<p> The lobbyists' letter states that "the least important global environmental 
issue is potential global warming, and we hope that your negotiators at Johannesburg 
can keep it off the table and out of the spotlight." 
<p> In his announcement Monday, President Bush said the U.S. team will offer plans 
that "advance the new approach to development that I embraced with other national 
leaders at the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development this past May." 
<p> "This new approach is based on shared accountability among developed and developing 
nations," the President said. 
<p> "The U.S. delegation will come to Johannesburg with concrete and practical 
proposals for strong and lasting partnerships to advance some of the world's key 
development priorities - clean water, modern energy, good health, and productive 
agriculture - that can lead us to a world without poverty," said President Bush. 
<p> A U.S. federal government report prepared for the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development issued today says the U.S. team will be promoting "good governance" 
and anticorruption at the summit, in particular "an integrated, cross-sectoral 
approach to addressing governance and sustainable development." 
<p> "The U.S. Government promotes good governance in every region of the world 
and believes that a good governance component makes environmentally oriented programs 
more effective. USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] is the lead 
agency in this work, providing &#36;700 million annually to support an array of 
democracy and governance activities," the report says. 
<p> The goals of U.S. assistance programs that support good governance are: democratic 
institutions that are effective, accountable, and transparent; an independent 
and fair judiciary; law enforcement that - with integrity - protects the people 
while strengthening their capacity to combat corruption; sound monetary; fiscal, 
and trade policies that promote economic growth, social development, and environmental 
protection; participation by all members of civil society in decisions that affect 
them.
