<p>In one more piece of evidence that the Earth's climate is warming rapidly, 
a new study published Friday in <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_new">Science</a></i> 
magazine has found that Alaska's glaciers are melting more quickly than previously 
believed.
<p> The resulting meltwater is also contributing much more to the rise in sea 
level than previous estimates, according to the study by a team of University 
of Alaska researchers in Fairbanks, which also found that both trends are accelerating. 
<p> "The rate of thinning has doubled in the past five years, compared to the 
40 years before," said Anthony Arendt, the study's main author.

</table></font>As a result, the Alaskan contribution to sea-level rise has also doubled, 
to about 0.27 mms a year during the past decade, or about twice the amount assumed 
by an international panel of scientists that last year predicted sea level would 
rise up to 11 centimeters (about four inches) by the end of this century due to 
global warming. 
<p> "It's a big deal if those rates have been underestimated," said Tom Janetos, 
an expert at the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment. "If 
these results are correct, the rate of sea-level rise has probably been underestimated 
in all international assessments." 
<p> More than 100 million people live on land within one meter of sea level, and 
storm surges can devastate coral reefs and low-lying islands and coastlines around 
the world. 
<p> "Although some degree of sea-level rise is anticipated in the coming decades, 
the greater the rise and the faster it occurs, the greater the impact will be 
on human population," according to Benjamin Preston, a researcher at the Washington 
D.C.-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change. 
<p> Despite their relatively small land mass--about 13 percent of the world's 
total mountain glacier area--Alaska's glaciers contribute about half of all sea 
rise caused by glacial melt and about twice as much as the amount of water lost 
from the entire Greenland Ice Sheet, according to the study. 
<p> A second study published in <i>Science</i> Friday will also add to concerns 
about the impact on oceans of faster ice melt. Using records compiled over the 
last 40 years, researchers at Columbia University found a sharp decline in the 
salinity of waters in the Ross Sea near Antarctica, as well as warmer air and 
water temperatures in the area. 
<p> The warmer atmosphere appears to have caused more rain and snowfall, less 
sea ice, and faster melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet, according to the 
study. Previously, low salinity found in masses of seawater flowing from the Antarctic 
to the South Pacific was attributed to more precipitation, but the new study confirms 
that increased melting of the ice cap itself is also a major factor. 
<p> Declining salinity could affect major ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream 
which warms the waters and climate of the North Atlantic region, according to 
oceanographers. One increasingly prominent theory suggests that a significant 
flow of fresh water into the North Atlantic could actually reverse the Gulf Stream, 
as it has in the past, causing an abrupt plunge in water and air temperatures 
in northeastern North America and northwestern Europe. 
<p> "If scientists have underestimated the amount of fresh water likely to enter 
the oceans in coming decades, they may have also underestimated the risk of such 
a phenomenon occurring," said Preston.
