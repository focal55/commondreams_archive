<p>RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned George W. Bush yesterday 
against unilateral action in Iraq, and suggested the U.S. President needs to keep 
a close eye on his allies, as well as his perceived foes, in the war on terrorism.</P>
<P>After an 80-minute meeting amid the imperial splendor of the Catherine Palace 
in the countryside south of St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin repeated his long-held belief 
that any action against Iraq should be taken within the framework of the United 
Nations. He also suggested Iraq shouldn't be the top priority, and that the focus 
on Saddam Hussein is a distraction from the international antiterrorism fight.</P>
<P>Asked by a U.S. reporter about his position on military action in Iraq, Mr. 
Putin turned the focus to neighboring Saudi Arabia, a country seen by the White 
House as a front-line, if not entirely reliable, ally since last year's attacks 
on New York and Washington.</P>
<P>&#34;We should not forget about those who finance terrorism,&#34; Mr. Putin 
said. &#34;Of the 19 terrorists who committed the main attacks on Sept. 11 against 
the United States, 16 are citizens of Saudi Arabia, and we should not forget about 
that.&#34;</P>
<P>Mr. Putin also cautioned that while Pakistan, another ostensible U.S. ally, 
has been reasonably stable under the rule of President Pervez Musharraf, the country 
has a dangerous mix of both nuclear weapons and active militant groups that needs 
to be watched.</P>
<P>As if underscoring his point that the war on terrorism can't be constrained 
to Iraq, Mr. Putin then asked a question that has been on the minds of many of 
late: &#34;Where has Osama bin Laden taken refuge?&#34;</P>
<P>In the process, he gently poked at what has become a U.S. sore spot since audiotapes 
released earlier this month seemed to confirm the al-Qaeda leader is still alive.</P>
<P>Since the tapes surfaced, politicians in the United States and around the world 
have questioned whether Mr. Bush should not focus first on finishing the fight 
against al-Qaeda before tackling the Iraq question.</P>
<P>However, despite Russia's reservations about using military action to disarm 
Mr. Hussein, Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush did sign on to a joint declaration calling 
for Iraq to disarm.</P>
<P>&#34;We call on Iraq to co-operate fully and unconditionally in its disarmament 
obligations or face serious consequences,&#34; the statement reads. However, it 
made no reference to the possible use of military action to enforce the demand.</P>
<P>While Russia, one of Iraq's few diplomatic allies, maintains that the recently 
passed UN resolution that sent weapons inspectors back to Baghdad does not contain 
any automatic triggers for war, the language of the statement was tough enough 
to send oil prices higher in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</P>
<P>Mr. Bush made the trip to Russia yesterday to communicate to a skeptical public 
here that this week's decision to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
into former Soviet territory is nothing to be feared. The alliance's enemy, Mr. 
Bush said, is no longer Moscow, but international terrorist organizations such 
as al-Qaeda.</P>
<P>&#34;The strategy of NATO is going to be based upon the fact that the Cold 
War is over,&#34; Mr. Bush said. &#34;Russia is a friend; Russia is not an enemy.&#34;</P>
<P>After his meeting with Mr. Putin, the U.S. President flew onward to Vilnius 
to meet with the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, three of the newest 
NATO members.</P>
<P>The Baltic republics -- once part of the Soviet Union, and now elated to be 
embraced by the West -- were preparing a hero's welcome for Mr. Bush.</p>
