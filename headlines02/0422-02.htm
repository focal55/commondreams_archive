Three North American natives who are resisting oil development in the 
Arctic and a Somali who has fought deforestation in her homeland are among 
this year's winners of the <a href="http://www.goldmanprize.org/" target="_new">Goldman Prize</a>, the world's richest and most 
prestigious environmental award.
<P>The other winners are an ecologist working to restore mangroves along the 
Thai coast, a Guyanese Amerindian who is trying to stop mining in native 
territories, a Polish farmer who promotes organic agriculture, and an 
entrepreneur who has stopped open pit mining projects in Puerto Rico's montane 
forests.
<P><img src="images/0422-02.jpg" width="117" height="91"><b> Jonathan Solomon</b>, <b>Sarah James</b> and <b>Norma Kassi</b>, the North American 
recipients of the prize, are Gwich'in natives from the Alaskan and Canadian 
Arctic. Their efforts to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge were born out of concern for the porcupine caribou herd, James said.
<P>The herd has sustained the Gwich'in historically, she said, and remains 
critical as a tribal source of food, clothing and religious artifacts.
<P>"The caribou are essential to our survival as a people," James said. "For 
thousands of years, we have cared for the caribou and the caribou have 
supported us. Drilling would occur at the heart of the herd's calving 
territory. It's a risk we can't take."
<P>Solomon said tribal members were gratified by a Senate vote last week 
killing a proposal to drill in the refuge. Opening the refuge to oil and gas 
exploitation was at the heart of the Bush administration's energy plan.
<P>"Drilling looks dead for now, but any change in the congressional makeup 
could (resurrect) it," Solomon said. "Our new focus will be on the 
congressional races, supporting people who understand the necessity of 
preserving Arctic ecosystems."
<P><img src="images/0422-07.jpg" width="62" height="91" alt="Jibrell"> <b>Fatima Jibrell</b>, a Somali who directs a regional relief organization, won 
for her resistance to the charcoal trade in her country.
<P>The basis of the Somali economy has changed in recent years from livestock 
to charcoal, Jibrell said.
<P>"Rift Valley fever has infected some stock, and now our usual customers 
from the gulf states won't buy them," she said. "But charcoal is very much in 
demand in the gulf, and wealthy entrepreneurs from Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the 
United Arab Republics are sponsoring massive logging in the acacia savanna. 
All that wood is turned into charcoal."
<P>Jibrell was able to obtain a national ban on charcoal exports from the 
acacia scrub region, but now Persian Gulf charcoal merchants have moved into 
Somalia's last remaining equatorial rain forest, home to elephants and other 
rare fauna.
<P>"It has gotten too big for us to handle regionally," she said. "We need 
help from the international community, especially from the United States. The 
Saudis in particular have to be served notice that the world won't stand for 
the liquidation of a priceless natural resource."
<P>The other recipients are:
<P><img src="images/0422-04.jpg" width="62" height="91" alt="PSIT CHARNSNOH"> <b>Psit Charnsnoh</b>, Thailand. Charnsnoh is working with local fishermen to 
restore mangroves and other coastal ecosystems adversely affected by large-
scale commercial fishing and logging. Charnsnoh, a Buddhist, overcame 
religious and cultural differences to forge partnerships with Muslim fishermen.
<P><img src="images/0422-03.jpg" width="62" height="91" alt="JEAN LA ROSE"> <b>Jean La Rose</b>, Guyana. An Arawak Indian, La Rose helped organize indigenous 
resistance to mining and logging projects on traditional native lands. She is 
leading other native activists in fighting the settlement of indigenous lands 
by thousands of small-scale miners and is seeking aboriginal title to about 3,
000 square miles of rain forest.
<P><img src="images/0422-06.jpg" width="62" height="91" alt="ALEXIS MASSOL-GONZALEZ"> <b>Alexis Massol-Gonzalez</b>, Puerto Rico. Massol-Gonzalez led a local effort to 
convert a mountainous mining zone to a community-managed forest reserve that 
features ecologically sustainable commerce. The forest is a United Nations 
Biosphere Reserve candidate, and Massol-Gonzalez' efforts are now promoted by 
the Puerto Rican government as a model for future collaborative projects 
between business and environmentalists.
<P><img src="images/0422-05.jpg" width="62" height="91" alt="JADWIGA LOPATA"> <b>Jadwiga Lopata</b>, Poland. A former computer programmer, Lopata runs a small 
organic farm near Krakow and is the founder of an organization that arranges 
tours of Polish "eco-farms." Thanks in large part to Lopata's efforts, the 
number of eco-farms in Poland has grown from 14 to 130 since 1993. About 13,
000 tourists have visited the farms during the past three years, and Lopata's 
program has served as a model for similar ventures in several other European 
countries.
.
The prizes will be presented in a ceremony at 5 p.m. today at the War Memorial 
Opera 
House in San Francisco.
<P>&nbsp;
<b>RECOGNIZING RISK-TAKING</b>
<P>Founded in 1990 by San Francisco philanthropists Richard and Rhoda Goldman, 
the Goldman Foundation bestows cash awards annually to environmental activists 
representing these geographic regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, 
Central America, South America and the island nations.
<P>The prizes, which now stand at $125,000 for each of the regions, are made 
to people who take "great personal risk" to safeguard the environment.</p>
