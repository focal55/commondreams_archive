            <p>In an effort to counter what they label as a McCarthyesque hunt 
              by a pro-Israel think tank, about 100 professors from across the 
              country have asked to be added to a "Campus Watch" Web site that 
              singled out eight professors because of their views on Palestine 
              and Islam. 
            <P>The Web site lists "dossiers" for the eight university professors 
              and teachers, including a graduate student instructor from UC Berkeley, 
              and portrays them as preaching dangerous rhetoric to students. The 
              site also calls them "hostile" to America. 
            <P>Run by the Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia think tank, the site, 
              www. campus-watch.org, also asks for people to snitch on Middle 
              East lectures, classes and demonstrations. 
            <P>"We are all ill-served by the mistakes, intolerance, the extremism, 
              the duplicity, that one finds in Middle Eastern studies," said Daniel 
              Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum. "Middle Eastern studies 
              is in an Enron- type crisis. . . . We are putting a spotlight on 
              what we consider to be a problem." 
            <P>But Judith Butler, a UC Berkeley professor of rhetoric and comparative 
              literature, said it is an intimidation tactic. 
            <P>The professors listed on the site have been spammed with tens of 
              thousands of racist, obscene and threatening e-mails. 
            <P>"If a group establishes a Web site and says, 'We are watching you,' 
              that has a very chilling impact on academic freedom," said Butler, 
              who was one of the first to ask to be added to the list. "The more 
              people who actively volunteer themselves for such a list, the less 
              that power of intimidation works." 
            <P>This is among recent tensions on university campuses regarding 
              the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
            <P>Last week, Harvard University President Lawrence Summers expressed 
              his concern that a call by students for divestment of university 
              endowment funds from Israel is an example of anti-Semitic actions. 
            <P>But Butler, who is Jewish, said there is "a very fundamental mistake 
              in assuming that any position critical of contemporary Israeli policy 
              is anti- Semitic. One can be pro-Israel and be extremely critical 
              of (Prime Minister) Ariel Sharon and the occupation." 
            <P>Pipes said he started the site to monitor anti-Israel sentiment 
              because he saw Middle Eastern studies as a monotheistic field where 
              alternative viewpoints are not heard. 
            <P>"The ivory tower has this privileged notion that no one can complain," 
              Pipes said. 
            <P>The Campus Watch Web site had received about 20,000 hits since 
              it went up last week, he said. 
            <P>The professors who have asked to be included on the Web site may 
              be put on a new list under a label of people who associate themselves 
              with "suicide bombings and militants," Pipes said. 
            <P>Professor Hamid Dabashi, chairman of the department of Middle East 
              and Asian languages and cultures at Columbia University, said in 
              an e-mail Friday that he is "honored" that so many of his colleagues 
              across the country have chosen to speak out against the site by 
              offering their names for the list. 
            <P>"I have received more moral support and endorsement of my career 
              as a teacher and a scholar over the last couple of weeks than ever 
              before," he said. 
            <P>". . . I have a stake in being party to voices of civilized dissent 
              against this horrific environment of fear, violence and intimidation 
              that the likes of Daniel Pipes want to perpetuate so that only their 
              views are heard." 
            <P>The list includes Stanford University, UC Berkeley and San Francisco 
              State University among 15 institutions to watch. For UC Berkeley, 
              the site gives information about graduate student Snehal Shingavi, 
              whose dossier is listed with the targeted professors, because of 
              a controversy over a course on Palestinian poetry that he is teaching. 
              The site says one class at the University of Chicago is an "extended 
              rant against Israel" and that professors referred to modern Israel 
              as Palestine. 
            <P>Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Middle Eastern history and director 
              for the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago, 
              who is listed on the site, said it is filled with "vicious lies" 
              about the institutions and individuals. 
            <P>He is especially offended that the site says Middle East studies 
              has become the preserve of Middle Eastern Arabs who have brought 
              their views with them and that the academics generally seem to dislike 
              the United States. 
            <P>"This imputation of un-Americanism, which is a theme in the writings 
              of these people, is very damaging to our democracy and debate," 
              Khalidi said. "It is a kind of gutter name-calling."
