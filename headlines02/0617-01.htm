<p>WASHINGTON - John Lewis remembers seeing them just on the periphery of the 
action.</P>
<P>He and others would be rallying, meeting, or marching, pressing for civil rights 
deep in the American South of the 1960s, and the FBI agents would often be there, 
too.</P>
<P>They'd be nonparticipants, of course. But they'd be there just the same.</P>
<P>Lewis, director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, wanted the 
agents to take a more active role, ''stopping the discrimination and the beatings,'' 
he said.</P>
<P>A few years later, Lewis learned why the G-men simply scribbled down names 
and notes while he and others were bitten by dogs and beaten by local police.</P>
<P>''They were spying on the movement,'' said Lewis, now a US representative from 
Georgia.</P>
<P>The spying extended to individuals as well. Tom Hayden, a former California 
state legislator who was a leader of the civil rights and antiwar movements during 
the 1960s, found memos calling for him to be ''neutralized.''</P>
<P>The FBI's counterintelligence programs on civil rights advocates, black radicals, 
and pacifists - code-named Cointelpro - generated a backlash after they came to 
light in the early 1970s. That backlash led to restrictions on how agents could 
conduct surveillance, how long they could conduct it, and who could be the subject 
of such surveillance.</P>
<P>Sept. 11, however, has provided federal officials with the motivation for a 
return to domestic surveillance. New guidelines spelled out by the Justice Department 
on May 30 make it clear that agents will be allowed to conduct ''online research'' 
even if their efforts are not linked to an established criminal investigation. 
Preliminary inquiries, which allow agents to gather evidence before a crime is 
committed, can take as long as a year, well beyond the old 90-day limit. Special 
agents in charge at the field office level can authorize terrorism investigations 
that used to require the approval of the director or assistant director of the 
bureau.</P>
<P>The new rules also allow agents to enter public places and events, such as 
religious gatherings and political events, to investigate possible terrorist activities.</P>
<P>Justice Department officials have emphasized that the excesses of the past 
won't be repeated.</P>
<P>But Lewis and others who found their names in once-secret FBI files aren't 
so sure. </P>
<P>''If they start down this road, it won't be halfway,'' Lewis said. ''It won't 
be a little bit. This is a very dangerous thing to do in a society such as ours.''</P>
<P>Supporters of the new policies argue that the safety of that society depends 
on an FBI that can monitor some residents to make sure all are protected. Even 
before the new rules were announced, former FBI agent Michael Miles was calling 
for more internal scrutiny.</P>
<P>''We're going to have to have an MI-5-type organization that just does domestic 
intelligence,'' said Miles, who was a counterterrorism consultant for Saudi Arabia. 
''We can't win this war without domestic intelligence.'' MI-5 is the British security 
intelligence system. It is similar to the CIA, but has more power to spy in domestic 
matters.</P>
<P>The British and people in some other European nations are more comfortable 
with domestic surveillance than Americans are, a fact that terrorists are well 
aware of, he said. Germany is an example of how opportunistic terrorists are, 
Miles said.</P>
<P>''There's a reason Al Qaeda based themselves in Germany,'' Miles said. ''With 
the history of the Gestapo, they know Germany's not going to spy on them. So they've 
used Germany as a sort of base. It's frustrating.''</P>
<P>However, many Americans, particularly those who have been the subject of domestic 
surveillance, find the prospect of a newly aggressive FBI alarming.</P>
<P>Lewis recalls former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's determined view, evident 
years later in the reams of documents Lewis got through the Freedom of Information 
Act, that the antiwar and civil rights movements had been infiltrated by communists 
who were using them to destabilize the United States.</P>
<P>And now, in Attorney General John D. Ashcroft's statements and in the new insistence 
that terrorists have burrowed deep into American society, Lewis sees frightening 
parallels. ''It is eerie,'' he said. ''It reminds me of another period in our 
history.''</P>
<P>After hearing how the bureau spied on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis 
requested documents on the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He got one 
batch on the organization and another on him.</P>
<P>The documents tracked Lewis's movements, noted people he spoke to and what 
he did. He was outraged, he said, but not shocked. ''We had lived with the possibility 
that this was going on,'' Lewis said. ''I was more surprised that they spent all 
of this time doing this. I felt then and still do feel that it was a waste of 
manpower.''</P>
<P>Hayden shares that view.</P>
<P>He obtained more than 20,000 pages of information through the Freedom of Information 
Act documenting domestic surveillance by both the CIA and the FBI.</P>
<P>''Included were memos from Hoover ordering that I be `neutralized' and inviting 
FBI suggestions,'' Hayden said.</P>
<P>Louis Schneider, executive secretary of the pacifist American Friends Service 
Committee from 1974 to 1980, said he remembers the day he got copies of the secret 
files the FBI had compiled on his organization.</P>
<P>The large stacks of boxes came with a 50-page summary that concluded that AFSC 
is not a ''subversive organization. It is a sincere pacifist organization.''</P>
<P>''I was amazed to see letters I had written to agencies in other countries'' 
inside the boxes, Schneider said. One letter, addressed to an agency head in Moscow, 
was opened and resealed.</P>
<P>Hayden said he does not oppose monitoring groups that could do serious harm, 
''but my experience indicates that our intelligence agencies always have a political 
and ideological agenda that interferes with their ability to understand the sources 
of hatred and alienation,'' he said.</P>
<P>That fundamental lack of understanding is part of the reason why the FBI has 
gone too far in the past, said Brian Glick, a lawyer who has represented civil 
rights era clients and written a book about the bureau's actions during Cointelpro.</P>
<P>Glick said he believes the bureau never completely stopped conducting Cointelpro-like 
operations; they just did fewer on a smaller scale. But now, with old restrictions 
removed, all bets are off, he said.</P>
<P>''My sense is the restrictions have operated somewhat like speed limits,'' 
he said. ''If the speed limit is 55 miles per hour, we'll drive 65, 70, or even 
80.''</P>
