</font>They carried soggy signs with slogans such as "War is Terrorism," "No Blood 
for Oil," "An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind" and "They're selling 
war - we're not buying."</P> 
<P> The demonstrators marched from the Buker School to a spot between the State 
House and the statue of Samantha Smith, the Manchester girl known as an advocate 
for world peace. The protest mirrored similar rallies across the nation and overseas, 
including one that protesters said drew 100,000 people in Washington, D.C.</P>
<P> "I want to thank George W. Bush for getting us all out here today - for waking 
up the American people," said Louise Diamond, co-founder of a Washington, D.C., 
group that works to resolve ethnic and regional conflicts around the world. "We're 
addicted to violence as a way of life, as a culture. We need to say yes to walking 
the peace path, instead of the warpath."</P>
<P> Dud Hendrick, a Naval Academy graduate and Vietnam veteran who is now a board 
member of the Maine Chapter of Veterans For Peace, criticized Bush for pursuing 
what he said is a doctrine of making pre-emptive military strikes anywhere Bush 
sees a threat.</P>
<P> "As a veteran, I'm asking you to do all you can to ensure your sons and daughters 
do not serve in this war," Hendrick said.</P>

</font>Tom Jackson, an activist and filmmaker who produced "Greetings from Missile 
Street," a documentary showing Iraqi citizens struggling to survive under economic 
sanctions, said modern warfare has the heaviest impact on children.</P> 
<P> "The children of Iraq and Afghanistan have just as much value as ours do here 
in the United States," Jackson said. He said people should consider not paying 
federal taxes so their money can't be used to support war.</P>
<P> Police made one arrest, but said the event overall went smoothly.</P>
<P> "It really went well - everybody was pretty well behaved," said Augusta Police 
Lt. Keith Brann. "One arrest for a crowd that large is pretty good. They're good 
people. They were easy to work with."</P>
<P> The arrest occurred on State Street, as a group of 60 to 70 protesters left 
the rally and marched in the middle of the street, Brann said. State Street, which 
had been closed to traffic for the march, had been reopened by then, so police 
told the crowd to move to the sidewalk.</P>
<P> David Webb, 29, of Rockland refused and was arrested on a charge of failure 
to disperse.</P>
<P> The crowd included participants of many ages. Young people sporting dreadlocks 
marched alongside leather-clad Vietnam veterans and bespectacled senior citizens. 
Several participants pounded on drums and chanted antiwar slogans as they marched.</P>

<P> AUGUSTA - Organizers of an anti-war protest at the Maine Capitol complex Saturday 
said their effort demonstrated the possibilities of negotiation.</P>

</font>"These people had differences," said Greg Field, executive director of 
<a href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/" target="_new">Peace Action Maine</a>, 
gesturing toward a rain-drenched crowd variously estimated to include 1,000 to 
3,000 people.</P> 
<P> Signs bobbing above umbrellas carried messages such as "Diplomacy not War" 
to "War is Terrorism."</P>
<P> Some marchers departed soon after reaching the Capitol without staying for 
the rally, making estimates of the number of participants highly uncertain.</P>
<P> Field said a unifying theme was the desirability of nations' agreeing to "work 
through the U.N." and that protesters shared a belief that unilateral military 
action against Iraq was unwarranted.</P>
<P> "A pre-emptive strike is wrong," he said. "There is not an imminent threat."</P>
<P> After marching to the State House from a nearby school, demonstrators gathered 
near a statue of Samantha Smith, the Maine schoolgirl who was internationally 
known for her advocacy of peace.</P>
<P> Joining intermittently in songs performed by a string of musicians, protesters 
applauded anti-war speeches.</P>
<P> "I think the overarching issue is the war," said Veterans for Peace activist 
Dud Hendrick, adding that an additional concern of demonstrators was "the endless 
war on terrorism."</P>
<P> The Augusta rally coincided with similar gatherings elsewhere in the state, 
around the nation and overseas.</P>
<P> In Concord, N.H., about 80 peace activists gathered at the Unitarian Universalist 
Church while dozens more withstood driving rain outside the State House to protest 
possible U.S. attacks on Iraq. "This War is Wrong!" was a common message on signs, 
stickers and buttons at the rallies, which were organized by Peace Response New 
Hampshire.</P>
<P> About 1,000 Vermonters marched through Montpelier under snow, sleet and rain 
Saturday to rally for peace. They listened as one speaker after another stood 
at a podium on the granite steps of the State House to call for an end to U.S. 
aggression.</P>
<P> Organizers in Maine were exultant at the size of the crowd and Field said 
he was sure the turnout had been held down by the inclement weather because some 
planning to attend had notified others they had changed their minds.</P>
<P> Police reported one arrest on a misdemeanor charge of failure to disperse.</P>
