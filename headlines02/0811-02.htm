<p>Bay Area organizations, backed by high-powered corporate attorneys, are taking 
the lead in a growing movement that uses U.S. courts to go after abusers of human 
rights worldwide. 
<P>Far from being just a rhetorical exercise, the potential impact of the movement 
became clear three weeks ago, when the <a href="http://www.cja.org/" target="_new">Center 
for Justice and Accountability</a>, based in San Francisco, won a $54.6 million 
judgment against two former Salvadoran generals living in Florida. 
<P>The ruling in favor of San Francisco high school teacher Carlos Mauricio and 
two other Salvadorans, who were tortured by security forces during El Salvador's 
civil war in the early 1980s, was the movement's biggest legal victory to date. 
<P>More than a dozen other cases are under way. The guiding doctrine is "universal 
jurisdiction" -- a legal concept stating that war crimes and other human rights 
cases can be tried in any nation's courts, no matter where the abuses took place 
or where the alleged offenders currently live. 
<P>"Universal jurisdiction is gaining force, and although it's far from clear 
how far the courts will take it, there are more and more cases all the time," 
says Naomi Roht-Arriaza, a professor of international law at Hastings College 
of the Law in San Francisco. 
<P>Roht-Arriaza points out that the two federal laws that support the concept 
are not new -- the Alien Tort Claims Act dates from 1789, and the Torture Victims 
Protection Act was enacted in 1991. 
<P>"There haven't been changes in the laws, but there's much more awareness by 
judges and litigants that these laws are out there," she says. 
<P>The Center for Justice and Accountability, a six-person nonprofit organization 
with only a $550,000 annual budget, is pursuing five other cases against individuals 
from China, Indonesia, Chile, Serbia and Honduras. 
<P>In one case, Gen. Johny Lumintang, the No. 2 official in the Indonesian army, 
is being sued by six victims of human rights abuses by troops under his command 
in East Timor. Lumintang initially chose to ignore the case -- a miscalculation, 
as he found out in September when a Washington, D.C., court awarded the plaintiffs 
$66 million. Now, the court is deciding whether to accept Lumintang's request 
to contest the charges. 
<P>Other cases brought by the center include: 
<P>-- China. Six Falun Gong practitioners are suing Liu Qi, mayor of Beijing and 
president of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2008 Olympics, for his alleged 
responsibility for police repression of the religious group. Liu was served with 
the complaint at San Francisco International Airport in February. 
<P>-- Chile. Armando Fernandez-Larios, a former Chilean army officer living in 
Miami, is being sued for his alleged involvement in the "Caravan of Death" - - 
a helicopter death squad that tortured and killed at least 72 political prisoners. 
<P>Meanwhile, another significant victory may be near in a case brought by three 
Bay Area activist groups -- <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/" target="_new">Global 
Exchange</a>, <a href="http://www.sweatshopwatch.org/">Sweatshop Watch</a> and 
<a href="http://www.asianlawcaucus.org/" target="_new">Asian Law Caucus</a> -- 
against 26 clothing corporations over abuses against Chinese workers in Saipan, 
a U.S. island in the western Pacific. Sources say all but one of the defendants, 
which include San Francisco firms Gap and Levi Strauss, are offering to pay the 
ex-workers $20 million and create a monitoring system to prevent labor abuses 
in their factories. A settlement is expected in the coming weeks. 
<P>But the universal-jurisdiction movement has had its setbacks, even in countries 
that have laws strongly supporting the concept. 
<P>Two years ago, Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon failed in his attempts to extradite 
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to stand trial in Spain for human rights 
abuses. In April, a Belgian appeals court threw out a lawsuit against Israeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon over his alleged role in massacres of Palestinian 
refugees in Lebanon in 1982. That case is being appealed to the Belgian Supreme 
Court, and the nation's parliament is debating a law that would allow the trial 
to go forward. 
<P>Although most of the U.S. cases originate with low-budget nonprofit groups 
such as the Center for Justice and Accountability, much of the actual prosecution 
is carried out by corporate law firms that donate their services pro bono. In 
a complex, long-running case, the value of these services can amount to millions 
of dollars. 
<P>The Salvadoran plaintiffs' case, for example, was led by a three-lawyer team 
from Morrison & Foerster, an international law firm based in San Francisco. The 
Caravan of Death plaintiffs are being represented by attorneys from Wilson, Sonsini, 
Goodrich & Rosati, a large corporate law firm based in Palo Alto. 
<P>On Monday, Morrison & Foerster is scheduled to receive the American Bar Association's 
annual award for pro bono work. Last year, the firm gave $21 million in free legal 
services to nonprofit groups or poor individuals. 
<P>According to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/" target="_new">Amnesty International</a>, 
there are hundreds of foreign human rights abusers now residing in the United 
States -- many of them, like the Salvadoran generals, in luxurious retirement. 
<P>Their former victims, along with organizations like the Center for Justice 
and Accountability and their teams of blue-chip lawyers, have plenty of work left 
to do.</p>
