<p>WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration will publish a comprehensive rationale 
today for shifting American military strategy toward pre-emptive action against 
hostile states and terrorist groups. It will also state, for the first time, that 
the United States will never allow its military supremacy to be challenged the 
way it was during the Cold War. 
<P>The document, titled "<a href="0920-05.htm">The National Security Strategy 
of the United States</a>," sketches out a far more muscular and sometimes aggressive 
approach to national security than any since the Reagan era. 
<P>It includes the discounting of most nonproliferation treaties in favor of a 
doctrine of "counterproliferation," a reference to everything from missile defense 
to forcibly dismantling weapons or their components. It declares that the strategies 
of containment and deterrence -- staples of American policy since the 1940s -- 
are all but dead.

</table>There is no way in this changed world, the document states, to deter those 
who "hate the United States and everything for which it stands." 
<P>In the 33-page document, President Bush also seeks to answer the critics of 
growing American muscle-flexing by insisting that the United States will exploit 
its military and economic power to encourage "free and open societies, " rather 
than seek "unilateral advantage." The document calls this "a distinctly American 
internationalism." 
<P>The document, which is one that every president is required to submit to Congress, 
is the first comprehensive explanation of the administration's foreign policy, 
from defense strategy to global warming. 
<P><b>COLD WAR DOCTRINES DEAD</b> 
<P>"America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing 
ones," the document states, sounding what amounts to a death knell for many of 
the key strategies of the Cold War. 
<P>One of the most striking elements of the new strategy outlined is its insistence 
"that the president has no intention of allowing any foreign power to catch up 
with the huge lead the United States has opened since the fall of the Soviet Union 
more than a decade ago." 
<P>"Our forces will be strong enough," the document states, "to dissuade potential 
adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, 
the power of the United States." With Russia so financially hobbled that it can 
no longer come close to matching American military spending, the doctrine seems 
aimed at rising powers like China, which is expanding its conventional and nuclear 
forces. 
<P>Administration officials who worked on the strategy for months say it amounts 
to both a maturation and an explanation of Bush's vision for the exercise of American 
power after 20 months in office, integrating the military, economic and moral 
levers he holds. 
<P>Much of the document focuses on how public diplomacy, the use of foreign aid 
and changes in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can be used 
to win what it describes as a battle of competing values and ideas -- including 
"a battle for the future of the Muslim world." 
<P><b>BUSH DEEPLY INVOLVED</b> 
<P>The president put the final touches on the new strategy last weekend at Camp 
David after working on it for months with his national security adviser, Condoleezza 
Rice, and with other members of the national security team. 
<P>A senior White House official said Bush had edited the document heavily "because 
he thought there were sections where we sounded overbearing or arrogant." But 
at the same time, the official said, it is important to foreclose the option that 
other nations could aspire to challenge the United States militarily, because 
"once you cut off the challenge of military competition, you open up the possibility 
of cooperation in a number of other areas." 
<P>However, at several points, the document states clearly that when important 
American interests are at stake, there will be no compromise. 
<P>The document argues that while the United States will seek allies in the battle 
against terrorism, "we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise 
our right of self-defense by acting pre-emptively." That includes "convincing 
or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities" not to aid terrorists, 
the essence of the doctrine Bush declared on the night of Sept. 11, 2001. 
<P>The new strategy departs significantly from the last one published by President 
Bill Clinton, at the end of 1999. 
<P>Clinton's strategy dealt at length with tactics to prevent the kind of financial 
meltdowns that threatened economies in Asia and Russia. The Bush strategy urges 
other nations to adopt Bush's own economic philosophy, starting with low marginal 
tax rates. While Clinton's strategy relied heavily on enforcing or amending a 
series of international treaties, from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to 
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to Kyoto protocols on the environment, 
Bush's strategy dismisses most of those efforts. 
<P><b>WRITTEN FOR THE 'BOYS' BACK HOME</b> 
<P>In fact, the new document -- which Bush told his staff had to be written in 
plain English because "the boys in Lubbock ought to be able to read it" -- celebrates 
his decision last year to abandon the ABM treaty because it impeded American efforts 
to build a missile defense system. It recites the dangers of nonproliferation 
agreements that it says have failed to prevent Iran, North Korea, Iraq and other 
countries from obtaining weapons of mass destruction, and says that the United 
States will never subject its citizens to the newly created International Criminal 
Court, "whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans." 
<P>The doctrine also describes at great length the administration's commitment 
to bolstering American foreign aid by 50 percent in the next few years in "countries 
whose governments rule justly, invest in their people and encourage economic freedom." 
It insists that the programs must have "measurable results" to assure that the 
money is actually going to the poor, especially for schools, health care and clean 
water.
