<p>US military investigators are to travel to a village in Afghanistan later this 
week to try to explain why an American AC-130 gunship killed at least 48 civilians 
in a bombing raid on a wedding party. 
<P>About 117 Afghans were injured in the attack on villages near Kakrak in southern 
Afghanistan earlier this month. US military officials at first refused to apologize 
for the bombing raid, insisting their pilots were fired at from the ground. 
<P>The attack appeared to trigger the first opposition to the US military from 
within the Kabul regime and has opened a potentially damaging rift between the 
president, Hamid Karzai, who is a Pashtun, and the powerful Tajik foreign minister, 
Abdullah Abdullah. 
<P>US investigators have started questioning servicemen involved in the operation 
at a military base in Kandahar. The team will travel next to the targeted villages 
where they will work "for as long as it takes" to find out what happened on the 
night of the raid, Colonel Roger King, a US military spokesman, said yesterday. 
<P>"War is not a precise art," Col King said, admitting that US military planners 
frequently had to rely on incomplete intelligence from local Afghan commanders. 
<P>"You can have precision munitions and they may indeed strike exactly where 
you think they ought to strike from 30,000ft &#91;9,000 meters&#93;, but that 
may not be where you ought to strike when you're three feet away," he said. 
<P>"You may also have, from time to time, less than perfect intelligence upon 
which you're acting." 
<P>Shortly after the July 1 attack Mr Karzai summoned US military chiefs to insist 
that "all necessary measures" were taken to prevent civilian deaths in future. 
Now, however, he appears to have tempered his anger and has defended US military 
tactics. 
<P>But others in the government are still furious. At the weekend Dr Abdullah 
said for the first time that Afghan officials wanted a say in the conduct of future 
raids. 
<P>"We have to be given a larger role. If things do not improve, well, I will 
certainly pray for the Americans and wish them success but I will no longer be 
able to take part in this," the foreign minister told the New York Times. 
<P>Yesterday Mr Karzai's chief of staff appeared to be at odds with Dr Abdullah. 
He said the Kabul government continued its support for US military actions and 
dismissed concerns about the number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan. 
<P>"Considering the scope of the operations I think the number of casualties is 
not that extensive," said Tayeb Jawad. "The fact is that the Afghans and the Americans 
are fighting the same war against terrorism. This is a combat in which we share 
many common objectives." 
<P>After the powerful defense minister, Field Marshal Mohammad Fahim, Dr Abdullah 
is the most important figure from the Northern Alliance in the Kabul government. 
Diplomats and aid workers in Kabul fear a split between the Alliance and Mr Karzai 
could seriously disrupt hopes for a stable government. 
<P>Marshal Fahim's forces include 500 armored personnel carriers and 300 tanks, 
which would be enough to dislodge the international security assistance force 
(Isaf) providing security in Kabul. US troops have in the last two weeks been 
called in to help guard Mr Karzai. 
<P>The New York Times said it had reviewed 11 areas in Afghanistan bombed by US 
planes and found 400 civilians were killed. Global Exchange, an American organization 
studying the effects of the military campaign, has drawn up a list of 812 Afghan 
civilians killed in US air strikes. 
<P>At the heart of the problem appears to be an American reliance on often faulty 
intelligence. In the villages near Kakrak there were at least two engagement parties 
on the night of the bombing and guests fired their guns into the air in a traditional 
form of celebration. US special forces troops in the area reported seeing anti-aircraft 
fire, although Afghans denied targeting American planes. Among the dead were 25 
relatives of Abdul Malik, a local warlord who fought alongside Mr Karzai after 
September 11. 
<P>Aid workers have also questioned the heavy firepower used in such raids. The 
AC-130 gunship is often used for devastating saturation night-bombing.
