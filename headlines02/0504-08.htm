PANCEVO, Yugoslavia (Reuters) - Three years ago, NATO
bombed a petrochemical plant and oil refinery at Pancevo near
the Danube river, sending a huge black cloud into the sky and
releasing more than 2,000 tons of noxious chemicals.

</table></font>The town's 140,000 residents still are waiting for a
clean-up -- and their fate is reflected elsewhere in
poverty-stricken Yugoslavia as it struggles with the poisonous
twin legacies of war and dirty socialist-era industry.
<P>
<P> "This town has a huge ecological problem," Pancevo Mayor
Borislava Kruska told Reuters. "I'm very, very concerned. We
are dealing with toxic, carcinogenic material."
<P>
<P> She complained that U.N.-led efforts to clear the hazard
had moved too slowly, but acknowledged that the dilapidated
complex already was an environmental headache before the Kosovo
war.
<P>
<P> Pancevo's pollution woes show that the reformers who ousted
Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslav leader in 2000 have their work
cut out for them to improve environmental standards, which
until now largely have been ignored.
<P>
<P> They need to redress years of neglect and under-investment
in new technology as well as the impact of sanctions and air
strikes against Milosevic's Yugoslavia, which left traces of
depleted uranium munitions at several locations.
<P>
<P> "We are facing a very big task," said Andjelka Mihajlov,
who heads the environmental protection unit of the health
ministry of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
<P>
<P> BELGRADE NO WHITE CITY
<P>
<P> Beograd (Belgrade) means White City in Serbian, although
these days that name belies its familiar grime-encrusted
concrete.
<P>
<P> A Western consulting firm recently ranked it among the
dirtiest cities in the world, an indication of the scope of the
challenge to narrow the environmental gap with the European
Union, the wealthy Western bloc it hopes to join around 2010.
<P>
<P> "Belgrade has never been so dirty," said Bane, a
31-year-old born in the city of 2 million people. "It has
become a lot worse in the past 10 years."
<P>
<P> Like others in eastern Europe in the Cold War, old
socialist Yugoslavia focused on industrial growth, paying
little attention to environmental issues in comparison to
Western countries. But its environmental standards were still
higher than in the Soviet bloc.
<P>
<P> During the Milosevic era, when Yugoslavia plunged into
poverty, the over-riding priority for many Serbs was staying
alive, not keeping rivers and forests clean.
<P>
<P> "Environmental issues were sleeping during these eight to
nine years," Mihajlov said. "Some things were put on paper but
not implemented."
<P>
<P> Eleven weeks of NATO bombing caused more damage, especially
in Pancevo, just a few miles up the road from Belgrade, and
three other "hot spots" that a U.N. expert mission identified
as in need of urgent action after the war.
<P>
<P> U.N. scientists said in March they had also found
widespread traces of depleted uranium from NATO munitions at
five other sites in Serbia and the coastal republic of
Montenegro.
<P>
<P> They said the level of contamination posed no immediate
health threat but still urged precautionary measures.
<P>
<P> Mihajlov said the government was stepping up its
environmental efforts with plans to create a dedicated
ministry. It also has drafted a protection law with the help of
Western experts.
<P>
<P> But Serbia faces a tricky balancing act with so many
pressing priorities. Most factories would have to close if
strict standards were introduced overnight, a social disaster
in a country with a jobless rate of at least 30 percent.
<P>
<P> "The environment is a high priority for the government of
Serbia but not the first priority," Mihajlov said.
<P>
<P> SEWAGE IN THE DANUBE
<P>
<P> In its quality of life survey published in March, Mercer
Human Resource Consulting said Belgrade scored an environmental
rating of only 53 points, based on the level of air pollution
and the efficiency of waste disposal and sewage systems.
<P>
<P> It came nowhere near the cleanest city, Calgary in Canada
at 166, and was also below other eastern European cities.
<P>
<P> That will come as no surprise for visitors to Belgrade, a
run-down city where battered old cars spew out fumes and sewage
is dumped into the rivers.
<P>
<P> "Air pollution is worse than it was before," Mihajlov said.
"No city in Serbia has a waste-water treatment plant.
Everything goes into the Danube."
<P>
<P> In Pancevo, Mayor Kruska suggested that the bombed
industrial complex should not have been built on the edge of
the town in the first place, even if the jobs were needed. "We
all knew it was dangerous ... that it was attacking our lungs
... our health."
<P>
<P> Nothing was invested in the plants during sanctions,
leaving them "rotten, old and neglected," she said. Then NATO
struck, causing a huge spill of oil, mercury and other toxic
substances.
<P>
<P> A U.N. team sent to Yugoslavia after the conflict urged the
immediate cleaning up of pollution caused by the bombing in
four "hot spots" -- Pancevo, the central town of Kragujevac,
Novi Sad in the north and the Bor mining center in eastern
Serbia.
<P>
<P> The U.N. Environmental Program identified 27 priority
projects, estimating the cost at &#36;20 million, of which just
over half has been raised. Pancevo was the worst affected, and
clean-up work there is lagging behind the others.
<P>
<P> NATO insisted that such industries were legitimate targets
in its campaign to end Serbian repression of Kosovo's Albanian
majority. Kruska said it should now foot the bill for causing
an "ecological catastrophe."
<P>
<P> U.N. project coordinator Dennis Bruhn painted a more
nuanced picture, saying the bombing's short-term impact was
limited. "The long-term damage could be huge. We don't know
about that yet."
<P>
<P> Visiting the war-scarred petrochemical plant in Pancevo, he
said good progress had been made but suggested not everything
could be removed unless donors gave more money. "You wouldn't
have enough funds to go all the way," he said.
