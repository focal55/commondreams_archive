<p>As US and British warplanes continued to pound southern Iraqi targets, Baghdad accused US President George W. Bush of using lies and deceit to garner NATO support for a military incursion.</p>
<p>The planes carried out raids "against civilian installations in the province of Misan," the official Iraqi News Service quoted a military spokesman as saying early Sunday.</p>
<p>The US Central Command confirmed that warplanes of the US-British coalition hit a mobile radar system in southern Iraq as they patrolled a no-fly zone established by the allies over the region in the aftermath of the Gulf War. </p>
<p>The strike, in which the aircraft used precision-guided weapons, occurred south of the Iraqi city of Al Amarah, approximately 264 kilometers (165 miles) southeast of Baghdad, at about 6:00 am (1100 GMT) Saturday, the command said.</p>
<p>The results of the strike were being assessed.</p>
<p>"Today's strike came after Iraq moved the mobile radar into the southern no-fly zone," the statement pointed out. "The radar provides tracking and guidance for surface-to-air missile systems that can target coalition aircraft." </p>
<p>Almost daily incidents currently oppose Iraq's air defenses and combat aircraft from the United States and Britain enforcing no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Iraq accused Bush of trying to lure his NATO allies into war as the US leader rounded off visits to future NATO countries in Europe with a new condemnation of the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>"Little Bush went to the NATO summit in Prague, carrying lies and his aggressive policies toward Iraq," said the Iraqi government newspaper al-Jumhuriya as Baghdad prepared for next week's launch of the first UN arms inspections in four years.</p>
<p>"Bush is using deceit in order to incite NATO countries against Iraq and render himself the guardian of security and peace in the world," said the daily.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, in a veiled warning to Washington not to go it alone, said the world could not rid itself of terrorism just by forcing a regime change in Baghdad.</p>
<p>"The international community must understand that it will not settle the problem of terrorism simply by settling the problem of Iraq," Ivanov said after a meeting in Moscow with the diplomatic chiefs of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which groups Russia, China and four former Soviet republics in Central Asia.</p>
<p>And the Bush administration gave its clearest indication to date it might consent to Saddam Hussein staying in power, if the Iraqi leader agreed to give up its suspected arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>The United States continues to insist that regime change in Iraq remains its official policy.</p>
<p>But US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told CNN Iraq's verifiable disarmament -- without Saddam leaving office -- could be a solution to the current standoff.</p>
<p>"The reason the president decided to go into the United Nations and accept the reality that inspections might not work, was that he concluded that war is the last choice, not the first choice," Rumsfeld said. </p>
<p>"It might be that (Saddam) would change his mind and open his country up and say, 'Well, I'd rather stay in power; then I'm willing to give up my weapons of mass destruction,'" he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Bush visited future NATO partners, telling nations who had been under Nazi and Communist occupation that they will help the alliance defeat the "new enemies of freedom": Iraq and terrorists.</p>
<p>"By his search for terrible weapons, by his ties to terror groups, by his development of prohibited ballistic missiles, the dictator of Iraq threatens the freedom of every free nation, including the free nations of Europe," Bush told tens of thousands of Romanians in Bucharest.</p>
<p>"The people of Romania understand that aggressive dictators cannot be appeased or ignored; they must always be opposed," he added.</p>
<p>"The United Nations Security Council and now NATO have now spoken with one voice: The Iraqi regime will completely disarm itself of weapons of mass murder, or we, the United States, will lead a coalition of willing nations and disarm that regime," Bush declared, two days after NATO demanded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein disarm.</p>
<p>The implicit knock on veteran alliance members like France and Germany -- which have been cool to Bush's push to disarm Iraq by force -- was a recurring theme in Bush's remarks during his five-day NATO expansion tour.</p>
<p>Bush visited Russia, Romania and Lithuania after a NATO summit in Prague, where allied leaders vowed to take "effective action" to secure Iraq's "full and immediate compliance" with UN disarmament demands, but stopped short of endorsing military action.</p>
<p>Discord simmered beneath the surface of unanimity, with Germany vowing it would never participate in military action against Iraq, although conceding it would assist if Iraq moved on US military bases in Kuwait.</p>
<p>German troops are currently stationed in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded in 1990.</p>
<p>Germany is also obliged by treaty to allow use of bases -- both German and US -- on its soil as well as the use of its airspace.</p>
<p>While the United States has been trying to line up the support of its European partners, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher denied Saturday a media report that Arab countries had been asked by Washington if they would cooperate in a war against Iraq.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard such a thing," Maher responded when asked about a report aired Thursday on Qatar's Al-Jazeera satellite television channel.</p>
<p>Al-Jazeera said Washington had written to 11 Arab countries, including Egypt, asking if they would be willing to cooperate in a war on Iraq and giving them one month to reply.</p>
<p>Egypt and the rest of the Arab world have expressed strong opposition to the United States' threats to attack Iraq.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, five more UN technicians arrived in Baghdad Saturday with 20 tonnes of equipment for next week's resumption of weapons inspections.</p>
<p>The experts, whose nationalities have not been disclosed, arrived at Saddam International Airport aboard a UN Hercules C-130 plane coming from Larnaca, Cyprus, which is the rear-base of the arms inspectors.</p>
<p>The plane was also carrying 20 tonnes of mainly computers, printers and communication 
equipment, the UN inspectors' Japanese spokesman in Baghdad, Hiro Ueki, told AFP.</p>
