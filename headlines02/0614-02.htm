<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A group of leading American 
writers, actors and academics have signed a <a href="#statement">statement</a> 
strongly criticizing their government's policies since September 11. It is an 
indication of a growing feeling that the administration is promoting its own agenda 
on the back of the attacks. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a statement called Not 
In Our Name, the signatories say the government has "declared a war without limit 
and instituted stark new measures of repression". They also criticize the media 
for failing to challenge the direction the government has taken. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They include the musicians 
Laurie Anderson and Mos Def, the actors Ossie Davis and Ed Asner, the writers 
Alice Walker, Russell Banks, Barbara Kingsolver and Grace Paley, and the playwrights 
Eve Ensler and Tony Kushner. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Martin Luther King III, 
Gloria Steinem, Noam Chomsky, Edward Said and Rabbi Michael Lerner have added 
their names, making this the widest ranging group of opponents of government policy 
since September 11. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jeremy Pikser, one of the 
organizers of the statement, said yesterday that he had been concerned that the 
rest of the world was under the impression that there was no dissent in the US 
to the bombing of Afghanistan and the plans for a war against Iraq. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pikser, a screenwriter who 
wrote Bulworth, a satire on American politics in which Warren Beatty played a 
politician who finally decided to speak his mind, said some people had been reluctant 
to add their names. "A lot of people haven't signed it, although they agree with 
it, because they think it might jeopardize other things they're involved in." 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clark Kissinger, another 
of the organizers, said they had been heartened by the number of people wanting 
to sign. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Kissinger, one of the 
organizers of the first anti-Vietnam war marches on Washington in 1965, said he 
was receiving about 60 emails a day from people who wanted to add their name to 
the list. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's a shame that there's 
not a voice of opposition coming out of the United States." </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The statement, which the 
signatories hope will be published by the American media, says: "We must take 
the highest officers of the land seriously when they talk of a war that will last 
a generation and when they speak of a new domestic order. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are confronting a new 
openly imperial policy towards the world and a domestic policy that manufactures 
and manipulates fear to curtail rights." </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Support for the president's 
policies remains high, however, and those who appear critical of them have been 
accused of lacking patriotism. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was announced last week 
that Bill Maher, host of the television show Politically Incorrect, has not had 
his contract renewed by ABC. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maher was criticized for 
an exchange six days after September 11 in which he and a guest agreed that whatever 
else the hijackers were, they were not "cowardly." </font></p>

In Our Name<br>
</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A Statement of 
Conscience</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let it not 
be said that people in the United States did nothing when their government declared 
a war without limit and instituted stark new measures of repression. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The signers 
of this statement call on the people of the U.S. to resist the policies and overall 
political direction that have emerged since September 11, 2001, and which pose 
grave dangers to the people of the world. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We believe 
that peoples and nations have the right to determine their own destiny, free from 
military coercion by great powers. We believe that all persons detained or prosecuted 
by the United States government should have the same rights of due process. We 
believe that questioning, criticism, and dissent must be valued and protected. 
We understand that such rights and values are always contested and must be fought 
for. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We believe 
that people of conscience must take responsibility for what their own governments 
do -- we must first of all oppose the injustice that is done in our own name. 
Thus we call on all Americans to RESIST the war and repression that has been loosed 
on the world by the Bush administration. It is unjust, immoral, and illegitimate. 
We choose to make common cause with the people of the world. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We too watched 
with shock the horrific events of September 11, 2001. We too mourned the thousands 
of innocent dead and shook our heads at the terrible scenes of carnage -- even 
as we recalled similar scenes in Baghdad, Panama City, and, a generation ago, 
Vietnam. We too joined the anguished questioning of millions of Americans who 
asked why such a thing could happen. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the mourning 
had barely begun, when the highest leaders of the land unleashed a spirit of revenge. 
They put out a simplistic script of "good vs. evil" that was taken up by a pliant 
and intimidated media. They told us that asking why these terrible events had 
happened verged on treason. There was to be no debate. There were by definition 
no valid political or moral questions. The only possible answer was to be war 
abroad and repression at home. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our name, 
the Bush administration, with near unanimity from Congress, not only attacked 
Afghanistan but arrogated to itself and its allies the right to rain down military 
force anywhere and anytime. The brutal repercussions have been felt from the Philippines 
to Palestine, where Israeli tanks and bulldozers have left a terrible trail of 
death and destruction. The government now openly prepares to wage all-out war 
on Iraq -- a country which has no connection to the horror of September 11. What 
kind of world will this become if the U.S. government has a blank check to drop 
commandos, assassins, and bombs wherever it wants? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our name, 
within the U.S., the government has created two classes of people: those to whom 
the basic rights of the U.S. legal system are at least promised, and those who 
now seem to have no rights at all. The government rounded up over 1,000 immigrants 
and detained them in secret and indefinitely. Hundreds have been deported and 
hundreds of others still languish today in prison. This smacks of the infamous 
concentration camps for Japanese-Americans in World War 2. For the first time 
in decades, immigration procedures single out certain nationalities for unequal 
treatment. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our name, 
the government has brought down a pall of repression over society. The President’s 
spokesperson warns people to "watch what they say." Dissident artists, intellectuals, 
and professors find their views distorted, attacked, and suppressed. The so-called 
Patriot Act -- along with a host of similar measures on the state level -- gives 
police sweeping new powers of search and seizure, supervised if at all by secret 
proceedings before secret courts. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our name, 
the executive has steadily usurped the roles and functions of the other branches 
of government. Military tribunals with lax rules of evidence and no right to appeal 
to the regular courts are put in place by executive order. Groups are declared 
"terrorist" at the stroke of a presidential pen. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must take 
the highest officers of the land seriously when they talk of a war that will last 
a generation and when they speak of a new domestic order. We are confronting a 
new openly imperial policy towards the world and a domestic policy that manufactures 
and manipulates fear to curtail rights. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a 
deadly trajectory to the events of the past months that must be seen for what 
it is and resisted. Too many times in history people have waited until it was 
too late to resist. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush 
has declared: "you’re either with us or against us." Here is our answer: We refuse 
to allow you to speak for all the American people. We will not give up our right 
to question. We will not hand over our consciences in return for a hollow promise 
of safety. We say NOT IN OUR NAME. We refuse to be party to these wars and we 
repudiate any inference that they are being waged in our name or for our welfare. 
We extend a hand to those around the world suffering from these policies; we will 
show our solidarity in word and deed. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We who sign 
this statement call on all Americans to join together to rise to this challenge. 
We applaud and support the questioning and protest now going on, even as we recognize 
the need for much, much more to actually stop this juggernaut. We draw inspiration 
from the Israeli reservists who, at great personal risk, declare "there IS a limit" 
and refuse to serve in the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also draw 
on the many examples of resistance and conscience from the past of the United 
States: from those who fought slavery with rebellions and the underground railroad, 
to those who defied the Vietnam war by refusing orders, resisting the draft, and 
standing in solidarity with resisters. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us not 
allow the watching world today to despair of our silence and our failure to act. 
Instead, let the world hear our pledge: we will resist the machinery of war and 
repression and rally others to do everything possible to stop it.</font></p>
