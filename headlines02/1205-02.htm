<p>In a bid to strengthen national security post September 11, both the West and some Asian countries, have introduced measures that threaten individual privacy, a new report has said.
<p>Governments in both the developing and the developed

worlds are extending control over individuals to

reduce the risks of terrorist attacks, said the annual

"Privacy and Human Rights survey report" by <a href="http://www.epic.org/" target="_new">Electronic

Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC), a public interest

research organization in Washington, and Privacy

International, a London-based human rights body.
 
<p>"It may take some years to fully evaluate the effects

of September 11th 2001 on privacy and civil

liberties," the report said. "Shortly after the events

of that day, previous proposals were reintroduced,

and new policies with similar objectives were drafted

to extend police surveillance authority," it said.
 <p>
 



The Privacy and Human Rights survey is an annual

exercise documenting measures that safeguard or

threaten privacy in the world. The 2002 report, which

deals with the impact of measures on privacy in over

50 countries, focuses on the effects of September 11,

2001, on privacy and civil liberties.
 <p>
 


"It continues to be our hope that a careful

examination of how countries around the world respond

to new challenges, even those as horrific as September

11, will enable the safeguarding of privacy in the

years ahead," said EPIC executive director Marc

Rotenberg in a foreword to the report.
 <p>
 


Privacy, the report stressed, was a fundamental human

right. "It underpins human dignity and other values

such as freedom of association and freedom of speech.

It has become one of the most important human rights

of the modern age... Privacy protection is frequently

seen as a way of drawing the line at how far society

can intrude into a person's affairs," it said.
 <p>
 


Since September 11, anti-terrorism measures have been

introduced in western countries such as Canada,

Denmark, France, Australia, Germany, Austria, the

United Kingdom, the United States and Sweden. In Asia,

similar measures were taken in India and Singapore, the

report stated.
 <p>
 


"Privacy has been attacked in various countries in

different ways," Privacy International director Simon

Davies told OneWorld Thursday. He pointed out that in

some countries such as the United States, while laws

were passed that impinged on privacy, there were

constitutional safeguards to protect privacy as

well.
 <p>
 



Davies said that, on the basis of the equation between

constitutional safeguards and invasive law, the

countries that had lost the most privacy rights were

the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.
 <p>
 


Australia and Canada introduced laws to redefine

terrorist activity and to grant powers of surveillance

to their national security agencies. India passed an

anti-terrorism law last year that allowed, among other

things, security forces to detain suspects without a

trial.
 <p>
 



In the United Kingdom, a law was passed in violation

of existing rules giving confidentiality to collection

data that allowed the authorities to access private

data for security reasons. In the United States,

several laws were passed, including one that increased

surveillance powers.
<p>



"Many of these proposals have had far-reaching

consequences for the protection of privacy," the

report said, adding that many more countries were

contemplating similar laws and measures. "New policies

are being proposed every week with the goal of

investigating, preventing, and suppressing terrorist

activity," it said.
<p>




Restrictions were imposed in many countries, including

members of the European Union, on communications to

enable governments to keep tabs on people using

telephones, mobiles or the Internet. In June 2002, the

European Union (EU) passed the Electronic

Communications Privacy Directive. It allowed EU member

to enact laws requiring Internet Service Providers,

and other telecommunications operators, to retain the

traffic and location data from mobile phones, text

messaging, land-line telephones, faxes, e-mails and so

on.
<p>




Belgium, France, Spain and the United Kingdom had

already introduced measures on accessing

telecommunication data, while similar proposals were

pending in the Netherlands and in New Zealand. In

China, the authorities could monitor all international

connections and identify individual users and

content.
<p>



Surveillance was also conducted with the use of cameras or

audio bugs, which were sold in millions every year in

Asian countries such as Hong Kong and Japan. The bugs,

used in many Asian countries to keep a check on

industrial espionage, were also planted in homes or in

offices.
<p>




The report said that surveillance cameras were

increasingly being used to monitor public and private

spaces throughout the world. The country leading in

this was the United Kingdom, which had some 1.5

million cameras watching public space. Surveillance of

public spaces had grown "markedly" in the United

States and Australia, it said.
<p>




"Several governments are now considering using

surveillance systems as an anti-terrorism tool," it

said. The report pointed out that the cameras were

being used in cities in the same way electricity and

telephone lines were in the first half of the last

century.
<p>



The 2002 report, however, found that efforts to pass

new data protection laws were continuing in Eastern

Europe, Asia and Latin America. "Important debates are

also taking place around the world concerning the

future of new technologies for identification and

surveillance," it said.</P>
