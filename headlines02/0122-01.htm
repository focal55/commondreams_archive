WASHINGTON - One year after George W. Bush was sworn in as president, 
prospects for a more peaceful, democratic and equitable 
world order about which his predecessor, Bill Clinton, used 
to wax eloquent, appear to have receded. 
<p>
Os ama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network, blamed for the 
Sep. 11 terrorist attacks that, clearly, were planned well 
before Bush was elected, contributed much to the year's 
bleakness. 
<p>
However, the hawkish, nationalistic, and unilateralist 
policies of Bush's administration have raised tensions from 
Israel to Indonesia, and from Colombia to the Koreas. 
Whatever hopes existed in the late 1990s for a new era of 
global cooperation in combating poverty, disease, and 
threats to the environment seem to have evaporated. 
<p>
When Bush took office, most foreign-policy analysts were 
considerably more sanguine. Bush's choice of ret. Gen. Colin 
Powell, a man of entirely mainstream views, as his secretary 
of state suggested more continuity with Clinton's 
more-internationalist approach to world affairs than a sharp 
turn toward the radical planks that made up the Republican 
campaign platform. 
<p>
Similarly, the closeness of the election - Bush was the 
first candidate in more than a century to win the White 
House despite losing the popular vote - also convinced many 
observers that he would have to ''govern from the center'' 
and drop, delay, or at least substantially dilute campaign 
pledges to the Republican right, such as building a national 
missile defense (NMD) system, which, according to the U.S. 
intelligence community, will likely to set an arms race with 
China that could ripple across the Eurasian landmass from 
Japan to the Mediterranean. 
<p>
Finally, the fact that Bush's father, the much more worldly 
and informed George H.W. Bush, was in itself a reassurance 
for many who were worried about the younger George's clear 
lack of interest in foreign affairs and his close ties to 
the Christian Right.. 
<p>
So, much of the foreign-policy establishment was stunned 
when, after six weeks in office, Bush ostentatiously pulled 
the plug on visiting South Korean President and Nobel Peace 
laureate Kim Dae Jung's ''sunshine policy'' toward North 
Korea by announcing that Washington had no intention of 
continuing high-level talks with Pyongyang aimed at freezing 
the North's ballistic missile program. The move caught 
Powell, who had assured reporters of Bush's full support for 
Kim just the day before, completely by surprise. 
<p>
Two weeks later, Bush humiliated Powell again - and angered 
visiting German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, as well as 
other European leaders - when he denounced the Kyoto 
Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in crudely 
nationalistic terms. ''(W)e will not do anything that harms 
our economy, because first things first are the people who 
live in America; that's my priority.'' 
<p>
Bush's subsequent withdrawal from the Kyoto negotiations was 
simply the first among a whole series of moves that 
demonstrated his administration's contempt for multilateral 
forums, particularly in the arms-control area. 
<p>
It subsequently disavowed both the global ban on land mines 
and the Comprehensive (Nuclear) Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); 
sabotaged UN negotiations on limiting international commerce 
in small arms; and walked out of another conference on 
strengthening the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and 
later announced that the treaty was ''dead'' so far as 
Washington was concerned. 
<p>
Taking advantage of popular fears created by the Sep 11 
attacks and ignoring recent intelligence estimates that 
found that ballistic missiles were the least likely delivery 
vehicle to be used by terrorists or ''rogue states'' to 
attack the US with weapons of mass destruction, Bush 
capped the year in December by officially withdrawing from 
the ABM Treaty, viewed by Russia and most nuclear analysts 
as ''the cornerstone'' of international arms control, to 
accelerate development of NMD. 
<p>
The unilateralist and surly attitudes behind these decisions 
should not have been surprising, given the administration's 
overall make-up. 
<p>
At the Pentagon, in Vice President Dick Cheney's office, and 
on the National Security Council staff, the hawks and 
unilateralists - usually in combination - clearly dominate 
the administration. Virtually of them are men, and they have 
strong likes and dislikes. They see Israel as a strategic 
ally and are especially fond of right-wing Likud governments 
there. They consider China, Iraq and Iran to be especially 
dangerous to US interests in parts of the world where they 
believe Washington's hegemony should be unchallenged. 
<p>
In the aftermath of Sep 11, many of the same analysts who 
earlier were hopeful that Bush would moderate his campaign 
positions, argued that his '' war against terrorism'' would 
force him to recognize the virtues of multilateralism, if, 
for no other reason than Washington required the 
co-operation of many foreign nations to close down 
al-Qaeda's finances. 
<p>
Wrong again. As coined by one senior State Department 
official, the administration has opted for ''multilateralism 
a la carte,'' meaning that it will co-operate with other 
countries only to the extent that it serves the US 
interest and does not compromise Washington's own freedom of 
action. 
<p>
That point has been made crystal clear by the conduct of the 
war in Afghanistan in which the administration not only 
turned down offers of military help from virtually all of 
its closest allies except Britain, but deliberately held up 
the insertion of European-led peace-keeping troops precisely 
because, in the words of Britain's top commander, that they 
might get in the way of Washington's ''high-tech, Wild 
West'' military operations and ''single-minded'' hunt for 
al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders. 
<p>
While Washington pursued its quarry, vast parts of 
Afghanistan remained inaccessible to relief convoys as 
starvation spread with the onset of winter and the country 
returned to the warlordism, banditry, and anarchy which 
helped give rise to the Taliban in the first place. Even 
now, the administration, just as it promised to its 
right-wing supporters, is resisting the use of US soldiers 
as peacekeepers to help stabilize the war-torn land and thus 
boost the authority of its new government, handpicked by 
Washington. 
<p>
Pentagon hawks have meanwhile been scanning the horizon for 
new theaters in the anti-terrorism struggle including the 
Philippines, Indonesia, Yemen, Somalia, the former Soviet 
Central Asia, Lebanon and, Iraq of course, and maybe even 
Iran - much as the Kennedy administration looked for places, 
like Indochina, where it could try out its new 
counter-insurgency doctrines in the early 1960s. The main 
difference, however, is that counterinsurgency was 
conceived as a comprehensive strategy aimed at winning 
''hearts and minds,'' while hard-liners appear to believe 
that military force alone can do the job. 
<p>
Meanwhile, US involvement in global peacemaking - a major 
priority under Clinton - has simply wilted on the vine. 
<p>
In addition to stopping Korean reconciliation virtually in 
its tracks last March, Bush - to Powell's clear discomfort - 
has watched impassively as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
was increasingly taken over by extremists on both sides over 
the past year and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon moved step by 
step to weaken, humiliate and dismantle Yasser Arafat's 
Palestine Authority and thus pound the final nail in the 
coffin of the eight-year-old, U.S.-led Oslo peace process. 
<p>
Similarly, Washington was conspicuously absent in efforts to 
keep alive the three-year peace process in Colombia, where 
there are already several hundred US advisers and to which 
it is planning to increase aid apparently in anticipation of 
the collapse of peace efforts. In Africa, apart from 
remaining on good terms with key oil-producers and South 
Africa, the administration has shown scarcely any interest 
at all.</p>
