</table>The practical effect of the decision could be considerable, as 20 U.S. states 
that still permit the death penalty to be imposed on mentally retarded individuals 
will have to change their laws and commute the sentences of mentally retarded 
prisoners awaiting execution. 
<p> There are some 2,455 prisoners on death row in those 20 states and an estimated 
five percent of them may be mentally retarded, according to New York-based Human 
Rights Watch (HRW). There are 3,701 persons currently awaiting execution across 
the United States. 
<p> A majority of six of the nine justices held in the case of 'Atkins v. Virginia' 
that execution of individuals with very limited intelligence serves no legitimate 
purpose and that a national and international consensus has emerged in recent 
years that the practice should be banned. Three justices dissented. 
<p> ''We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will 
measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty,'' 
wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in the majority opinion. 
<p> Human rights and death-penalty abolition groups said the decision marked a 
major advance for their causes. 
<p> ''Executing the mentally retarded has long been a violation of international 
standards of justice and decency,'' said William Schulz, executive director of 
Amnesty International USA (AIUSA). ''In its Atkins v. Virginia decision, the U.S. 
Supreme Court has finally ushered the United States into the civilized nations 
when it comes to such executions.'' 
<p> ''Thirty states have either banned the death penalty altogether or stopped 
the execution of those with mental retardation,'' noted Richard Dieter, who heads 
the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC). ''There is no doubt that there is 
now a national consensus on this issue.'' 
<p> ''Concerns remain about other aspects of the death penalty,'' he added, ''but 
at least today we have stopped a practice that most Americans and the rest of 
the world finds abhorrent.'' 
<p> The three dissenting justices -- all nominated by Republican presidents -- 
strongly disagreed with the majority's conclusion. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 
who was appointed by former President Richard Nixon 30 years ago, objected in 
particular to the majority's reference to foreign laws and public opinion as considerations 
in its decision. 
<p> Since 1995, only three countries -- Japan, Kyrgyzstan, and the United States 
-- are reported to have carried out executions of mentally retarded defendants, 
according to Amnesty. Since 1977, at least 35 mentally retarded prisoners, or 
those with significant brain damage, have been executed in the United States, 
the London-based group said. 
<p> The dissenting judges also noted that the majority effectively overruled a 
1989 decision that found explicitly that executing the mentally retarded did not 
violate the Constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. ''Seldom has an 
opinion of this court rested so obviously upon nothing but the personal views 
of its members,'' wrote Justice John Scalia, generally seen as the most right-wing 
member of the Court. 
<p> But the 1989 decision based its decision on the assertion that a ''national 
consensus'' against the practice had not yet developed. At the time, only two 
states prohibited execution of the mentally retarded. Thirteen years later, 16 
more states and the federal government itself have all enacted laws banning the 
practice. 
<p> ''It is not so much the number of these states (that have banned the practice) 
that is significant, but the consistency of the direction of the change,'' Stevens 
wrote, adding that it ''is fair to say that a national consensus has developed 
against it.'' 
<p> While the Court majority noted Washington's international isolation on the 
issue, it placed stronger emphasis on domestic public opinion, including strong 
statements in recent years by major U.S. religious, psychological and criminology 
associations, as well as bans enacted by state legislatures. A Gallup poll released 
last month found that 82 percent of the public opposes executing the mentally 
retarded and only 13 percent support it. 
<p> Atkins v. Virginia involved a defendant, Daryl Atkins, with an Intelligence 
Quotient (IQ) of only 59, who was convicted for the 1996 robbery and murder of 
Eric Nesbitt. An IQ of less than 70 is considered a major indicator of mental 
retardation. 
<p> Most scholars of criminal law have long argued against executing mentally 
retarded defendants for the same reason that that they have opposed the death 
penalty for children. 
<p> Like children, their disability makes it hard for them to understand legal 
concepts, and their unreliable memories and difficulty in processing information 
make it hard for them to cooperate in their own defense. 
<p> ''Being characteristically eager to please authority, many detainees with 
mental retardation waive their rights to remain silent and even make false confessions,'' 
according to HRW, which last year published a report called 'Beyond Reason, The 
Death Penalty and Offenders with Mental Retardation.' 
<p> In one recent case, also in Virginia, a defendant, Earl Washington, confessed 
to crimes he never committed. After being sentenced to death, Washington received 
an absolute pardon when DNA testing revealed his innocence. 
<p> ''Although they commit terrible crimes, by virtue of their disability, they 
should never be considered among the most culpable offenders for whom, in the 
United States, the death penalty is ostensibly reserved,'' said Jamie Fellner, 
director of HRW's U.S. program. 
<p> As recently as two months ago, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights approved 
a resolution urging those U.S. states that retain capital punishment not to impose 
it against the mentally retarded. In 1998, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, 
Summary or Arbitrary Executions said that such executions violated the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which bans cruel and unusual punishment. 
<p> ''To execute a mentally impaired offender flies in the face of international 
human rights standards,'' said Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn, with AIUSA's campaign to 
abolish the death penalty. 
<p> Even President George W. Bush, who as Texas governor oversaw the execution 
of at least three defendants with IQs of less than 70, has changed his mind. ''We 
should never execute anybody who is retarded,'' he said last year. 
<p> Some death-penalty foes said the Court's reasoning might be important in cases 
where juveniles tried in adult courts face the death penalty. According to AIUSA, 
the Missouri Supreme Court temporarily halted the Jun. 5 execution of a juvenile 
convicted of murder pending Thursday's ruling.
