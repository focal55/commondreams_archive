CARACAS, Venezuela, April 14 — Hugo Chávez's supporters began gathering Saturday at the Miraflores presidential palace, drifting into its underground hallways and ornate meeting rooms. Bleary-eyed and exhausted, young militants from his movement darted from room to room, making calls and huddling in improvised gatherings.
<P> Although the palace had never been under control of the troops who had removed Mr. Chávez from power, young men with Uzi machine pistols stood tense guard.</P> <P> But shortly after 10 p.m., the news started to spread: Mr. Chávez, the mercurial leader who had been deposed just 43 hours earlier, was coming home. His backers' frantic, last-ditch effort to win back the presidency, a sort of counter-coup, was succeeding.</P> <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

</font>Whoops of joy sprung from the ministers and office workers, members of congress and aides, who just hours before had been in hiding. 
<P> In a remarkable turn of events, a second popular uprising in two days was on the verge of succeeding, with Chávez supporters regaining control of Miraflores, the state-run television station and military garrisons.</P> <P> Then at 3 a.m. today, Mr. Chávez, dressed in a blue windbreaker and tennis shoes, arrived here by helicopter, clearly tired but brimming with emotion. To his supporters, this was a moment filled with triumph.</P> <P> "We went from one emotion to another, being hunted down and humiliated," said Desiree Santos, a member of the National Assembly. "Everything looked lost. That is why we are so emotional right now."</P> <P> Indeed, as Mr. Chávez arrived at Miraflores, ferried from a naval base where the interim government had him in custody, thousands of supporters screamed in joy outside the palace gates. They waved flags and blew horns, shot off fireworks and honked their car horns. </P> <P> Inside, in a marble-floored courtyard where diehard supporters waited, there were tears and hugs. "The people love you, the people love you," one man told the president.</P> <P> Mr. Chávez was surrounded by by his ministers and National Assembly allies, their relatives and aides. The beefy leader greeted them, one by one, with bear hugs as others patted him on the back.</P> <P> "I feel so happy," said Leticia Landaeta, tears on her cheeks moments after she was embraced by Mr. Chávez. "We were so sad, but we knew it was never going to be for long. What happened was so wrong." </P> <P> With sweat beading his brow, his voice soft from exhaustion, Mr. Chávez gave thanks and provided encouraging words. He even rattled off one or two jokes.</P> <P> "If I had not come back now, I would have come back in five years," he told one supporter. "At least that would have given me time to rest." </P> <P> But everyone in the room knew that they had been very lucky to have pulled off Mr. Chávez's return. Hours earlier, the interim government, headed by Pedro Carmona, had appeared to be consolidating its hold. Chávez administration officials — from Vice President Diosdado Cabello to National Assembly members — were in hiding.</P> <P> Many had abandoned their homes and offices as police embarked on raids to turn up evidence of official involvement in a series of shootings during the Thursday protests that swept Mr. Chávez from Miraflores. The interim government blamed the killings of at least a dozen demonstrators on neighborhood groups tied to the president.</P> <P> Rafael Vargas Medina, Mr. Chávez's minister of the secretariat, said that he dyed his gray hair black and abandoned his home. Unshaven and bedraggled as he spoke in his office early this morning, Mr. Vargas said he was embittered by the experience, calling it a violation of his rights. He and other Chávez officials, in fact, contend that most of those killed were Chávez supporters, fired upon by security forces allied with the interim government.</P> <P> "From the moment they took power, it was a witch hunt," said Mr. Vargas. "I stayed in one apartment, then moved to another. I used one driver. Then switched to another."</P> <P> Mr. Cabello said he was "chased all over."</P> <P> "I had to hide, my family had to hide," he said. "I just kept moving with different people. I slept in the homes of friends, people who supported what we were doing." </P> <P> But through it all, officials said they maintained contact with one another, using cell phones. They also reached out to supporters, trying to organize protests. The plan all along, they said, had been to attempt a return.</P> <P> When the poor people of this sprawling city, Chávez supporters infuriated by his ouster, took to the streets by the thousands, the battle to resume possession of the government had gained momentum.</P> <P> "We called our social networks so they would carry out their manifestations," said Ms. Santos, who said she had also been in hiding. "We decided, with the people, to then take Miraflores." </P> <P> By Saturday afternoon, with pro-Chávez crowds in control of the streets around Miraflores, National Assembly members of Mr. Chávez's movement as well as other supporters began to congregate at the palace. They were soon joined by the president's ministers. </P> <P> "We are so happy, so satisfied," said Leonardo Ramírez, an assistant in the president's office, said shortly before midnight Saturday. "We are restoring power through the Constitution. </P> <P> Surrounding by his adoring supporters, Mr. Chávez laughed and seemed gripped by the emotion of the moment. But, in the early morning hours before dawn, he said later, he was also "stupefied" by his roller coaster journey and thankful.</P> <P> "This was a lesson from God," he said. "This is nourishment for the soul." </P>
