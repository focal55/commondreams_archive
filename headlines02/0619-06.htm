<p>WASHINGTON, Jun 18  -  
							Colombia once again proved to be the most dangerous country in the world for trade union activists in 2001, according to the latest 'Annual Survey of Violation of Trade Union Rights' released Tuesday by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). 
<p> The South American country accounted for 90 percent of the 223 murders and 
disappearances of labor unionists worldwide, hitting a record 201 for the year, 
or just about 90 percent of the global total, the report said. 
<p> Asia proved to be the region where union organizers were most likely to be 
detained or imprisoned in 2001. While 200 trade unionists were imprisoned in South 
Korea alone, sentences were harshest in China, where organizers were often singled 
out for torture and the arbitrary extensions of sentences. 
<p>
The Survey counted a total of 4,000 arrests and 10,000 firings of union activists worldwide during the year. 
<p> Zimbabwe and Swaziland stood out among the worst violators of trade union 
rights in sub-Saharan Africa. In Europe, Belarus ''stands out quite simply as 
an unabridged encyclopedia of trade union rights violations,'' the report noted, 
adding that in many Middle Eastern and Asian countries, such as Syria, Iraq, North 
Korea, Vietnam and Burma, independent labor unions remain under legal ban. 
<p> The ICFTU, whose unions represent 157 million workers in 148 countries, found 
that much of the past year's repression of unions was due to pressures resulting 
from continuing global economic liberalization promoted by industrialized countries 
and the international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), which they largely control. 
<p>
''Throughout the world, workers have been hit hard by the negative impact of the downturn in the global economy coupled with structural adjustment measures, but where they have expressed their discontent governments have been quick to respond with repression,'' according to the confederation. 
<p> Thus, in Argentina, the ''cocktail'' of an acute economic crisis, privatization 
of public services, and new laws designed to weaken labor unions resulted not 
only in thousands of lost jobs, but also in major demonstrations, lethal confrontations 
with police, and eventually the resignation of a series of presidents. 
<p> In Central and Eastern Europe, where governments are competing for foreign 
investment, a number of parliaments, including Yugoslavia's and Russia's, approved 
new labor codes that weaken worker rights -- making it easier to dismiss workers 
or favoring short-term contracts, for example. 
<p>
In a number of countries throughout the region, firings, relocations and threats of bodily injury increased steadily. In Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko defeated trade union leader Vladimir Goncharik in an election denounced internationally as neither free nor fair, trade union activity has become a ''virtual impossibility,'' the Survey said. 
<p> In Bangladesh, Iqbal Majumber, the leader of the Jatiyo Sramik union and a 
major figure in the battle against privatization and deregulation, was murdered 
last August in one of the year's most prominent killings. 
<p> While the government routinely blamed the anti-labor violence in Colombia 
on the long-running civil war there, the Survey noted that many victims, particularly 
among the hard-hit public-sector unionists, had taken strong stands against economic 
liberalization and privatization Some 65 percent of those murdered in Colombia 
worked in the public sector, according to the report. 
<p>
Strike breaking and union busting by private employers, as well as governments, also flourished in much of the world during 19981. 
<p>
The Survey found a both practices were &#8221;rife&#8221; in much of Asia, particularly in China, South Korea, Indonesia, and Pakistan where, it said, ''employers have no qualms hiring thugs to attack workers, especially when they are on strike or occupying their workplaces.'' 
<p> In China, repression of trade unionists intensified as worker unrest spread 
throughout much of the country. One union organizer, Yao Guisheng, who was sentenced 
to 15 years' forced labor based on false accusations, suffered a severe mental 
breakdown after being beaten and confined to a cell. 
<p>
Repression also increased in Africa, especially in Zimbabwe where trade union chief Morgan Tsvangirai failed to unseat President Robert Mugabe in elections earlier this years which were also widely denounced, especially by western election observers. 
<p>
Some 223 of the 282 cases of injured or assaulted trade unionists recorded in 37 African countries covered by the report took place in Zimbabwe last year. Three striking workers were killed at the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company last August when the army opened fire during a demonstration. 
<p> The Survey also cited Malawi and Swaziland as countries which have shown little 
respect for labor rights, while Sudan, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea and Libya all 
maintained their long-standing bans on independent unions. 
<p> Besides Colombia, union organizers were killed in Brazil, Bolivia and Guatemala 
in Latin America last year. Two of the worst areas for labor rights abuses in 
Central America were in banana plantations and Export Processing Zones (EPZs) 
which have become an increasingly important sector for the region's economies 
since the United States enacted the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) almost 20 
years ago. 
<p> In El Salvador, on the other hand, workers at a Taiwanese-owned textile plant 
in one of the country's four EPZs gained formal recognition of their union, marking 
a major breakthrough in labor rights in that country. 
<p>
Nor was that the only good news during the year, according to the Survey. International campaigns succeeded in winning the release of imprisoned or detained trade unionists in several countries around the world, including Thailand, Ghana, Belize, and the Central African Republic. 
<p> Small advances in the recognition of labor rights were also achieved in Bahrain, 
Iran, and Yemen, although the general situation for trade unions in the Middle 
East remained ''gloomy,'' particularly for migrant workers, according to the Survey.
