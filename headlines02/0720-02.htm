<p>Human rights groups warned yesterday that plans by the Israeli army to deport 
the relatives of two Palestinian men accused of being behind this week's militant 
attacks could be a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. </p>
<p>Israeli soldiers demolished the homes of two suspected Palestinian militants 
overnight, and took at least 16 of the two men's male relatives into custody.</p>
<p>Officials said the army was considering deporting some or all of those detained 
from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip, as a deterrent to other militants - a plan 
that came in for rare criticism from the US government yesterday. </p>
<p>Israeli troops raided Askar refugee camp near Nablus, according to witnesses. 
They said soldiers blew up the home of Ali Ajouri, a commander in the Al-Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades. Israeli officials accused Mr Ajouri of being behind Wednesday's 
double suicide bombing in Tel Aviv in which three people died, as well as the 
bombers. </p>
<p>The soldiers detained several of Mr Ajouri's male relatives. Among them, according 
to witnesses, was 72-year-old Mohammad Ajouri. The Israeli army closed the area 
to reporters yesterday. </p>
<p>The army also destroyed the home of Nasser abu Asida, an alleged Hamas militant, 
and arrested several of his male relatives. Israeli officials accused Mr abu Asida 
of planning Tuesday's bus ambush in which nine people died. </p>
<p>The two attacks came as a blow to Israelis after more than three weeks of calm. 
The Israeli army has reoccupied all but one large West Bank town and placed them 
under almost constant curfew, but the militants still slipped through, and the 
Israeli authorities have been desperately searching for a new response. </p>
<p>Demolishing militants' houses - also a breach of the Geneva Conventions, according 
to human rights organizations ( but not a war crime) - has been going on for some 
time, but this would be the first time relatives of suspected militants have been 
deported in the current intifada. Officials said deportations would not go ahead 
until the attorney-general, Elyakim Rubenstein, approved them as legal. </p>
<p>"Family members will be interrogated and whoever was connected to the attack, 
for example knew about it beforehand, would be considered an accomplice," an Israeli 
security source said. "Anyone who was directly involved in planning an attack 
would be put in jail, but anyone with only a linkage could be punished and deported."</p>
<p>Both international and Israeli human rights organizations said deporting relatives 
of militants would be a breach of international law. Neil Durkin, a spokesman 
for Amnesty International, said: This is a form of collective punishment. If these 
people have committed no crime then deporting them would be a breach of the Geneva 
Conventions. </p>
<p> UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's spokesman said Mr Annan was "disturbed" 
by reports of the deportation plan and of the house demolitions. </p>
<p>"While (Annan) has repeatedly condemned suicide bombings and upheld Israel's 
right to defend itself, the secretary-general wishes to make clear that self-defense 
cannot justify measures that amount to collective punishments," his office said. 
</p>
<p>Miranda Sissons, of Human Rights Watch, said: "Collective punishment is outlawed 
under the fourth Geneva convention. It is a fundamental principle of all legal 
systems that someone who committed a crime is individually responsible for it. 
People who weren't responsible for a crime can't be punished. Secondly, there 
is a question whether deporting people to Gaza counts as forced transfer of people 
against their will. If it does, that is a war crime."</p>
<p>B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization said: "A state engaging in such 
collective punishment, even in response to murderous attacks against its own innocent 
civilians, loses moral justification for its action. The punishment of innocent 
persons will constitute an unerasable moral blight on the State of Israel." </p>
<p>A US State Department spokesman said: "We expect that Israel's actions in its 
campaign against terror will be based on information related to an individual's 
culpability and not on personal or family relationships. We think that taking 
punitive actions against innocent people will not solve Israel's security problems 
and we will be raising that issue with the Israelis."</p>
<p>Shimon Peres, a leading moderate in Israel, said he would support deportations 
if they were declared legal.</p>
<p>The militant group Hamas threatened more suicide bombings if the army went 
ahead with deportations.</p> </p>
