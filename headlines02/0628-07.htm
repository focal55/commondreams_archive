<p>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - Thousands of jobless Argentines converged on the 
presidential palace and Congress in Buenos Aires on Thursday and peacefully protested 
the deaths of two demonstrators a day earlier in the worst riots since the elected 
government was toppled in December.

Thursday, June 27, 2002. Thousands of government opponents marched in anger over 
a police crackdown on jobless protesters that left two people dead and 90 wounded 
a day earlier. The dead and injured fell during volleys of rubber bullets and 
tear gas on Wednesday that marked the worst violence in Argentina since street 
rioting over the collapsing economy claimed 29 lives last December. (AP Photo/Marcelo

</table></font>In a demonstration that lasted several hours, an estimated  10,000 civil rights activists and unemployed people chanted  anti-government slogans calling for caretaker leader Eduardo  Duhalde's resignation.<p>They also accused the police of being heavy handed in  Wednesday's deadly clashes on the outskirts of the capital,  which erupted during a protest against deepening poverty and  joblessness under Duhalde.</span>
				
<P> <span class="newsContent">But while police arrested 30 demonstrators armed 
with stones and Molotov cocktails as they headed to join Thursday's protest, there 
was no repeat of the violent confrontations with police in which the two demonstrators 
were shot dead. Thursday's protesters later headed home without major incident.</span><span class="newsContent">
<p>Teachers and state workers also went on strike earlier in the day to protest 
the deaths but their stoppage had little impact.
<p>Analysts played down Wednesday's violence, saying it was not representative 
of most protests, while the government blamed political "extremists" for stirring 
up trouble.
<p>"Most protesters are not looking for violence," said political analyst Manuel 
Mora y Araujo. "I don't think yesterday's troubles should carry too much weight."
<p>Duhalde, languishing in the polls and fighting for his political future, has 
vowed to get tough on protests as he struggles to convince a skeptical International 
Monetary Fund to send aid. An agreement is vital for stemming a spiraling social 
crisis and a punishing four-year recession.
<p>His economy chief, Roberto Lavagna, met with senior IMF officials in Washington 
on Thursday to convince the lender to start fully fledged aid negotiations.
<p>NO SIGN OF IMF AID
<p>An advance IMF mission left Argentina this weekend with no sign of progress 
toward a deal. Analysts say at best it would just be a rollover of existing obligations 
to lenders like the fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
<p>As Lavagna left the IMF to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, his spokesman 
said he hoped to agree a date for IMF economists to travel to Buenos Aires to 
negotiate a loan.
<p>"We hope that here in the next couple of days we will have the decision about 
the next stage of the negotiations, that is the trip of a mission to Buenos Aires 
again," Lavagna's spokesman Sergio Federovisky told reporters.
<p>But IMF officials are skeptical a government pressured by growing poverty and 
joblessness will stick to vows to end the runaway spending that landed the economy 
in crisis in the first place, and analysts believe any eventual pact is some way 
off.
<p>Hopes for an imminent deal with the IMF appeared slim on Thursday as German 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said bluntly at a summit in Canada that the nation 
has not met the conditions for a full resumption of IMF relations.
<p>Already under pressure to call early elections, and with his popularity rating 
at just 8 percent in the polls, Duhalde is striving to head off a repeat of the 
violence that toppled ex-president Fernando de la Rua in December.
<p>With half of the population living in poverty, 24 percent of the workforce 
out of a job, and consumer prices soaring after the devalued peso shed around 
75 percent of its value against the dollar, Argentina is a social pressure cooker.
<p>The food riots last year that forced De la Rua out and killed 27 people ushered 
in political chaos until Duhalde, the fifth president in a month, was named by 
Congress in January to marshal Argentina through to elections in September 2003.
<p>But a default on part of the $133 billion public debt and the end of a decade-old 
currency peg to the dollar have only deepened Argentina's economic gloom.
<p>Despite vocal opposition from protesters, the government said it would continue 
to suppress any violence.
<p>"This is the deepest crisis in Argentina's contemporary history and the country 
cannot support more violence," Cabinet Chief Alfredo Atanasof said. 
<p>The sight of riot police breaking down the door of a local branch of the Communist 
Party headquarters on Wednesday in search of protesters added Argentines' fears 
of a slow breakdown in democracy in a country that suffered one of Latin America's 
most brutal military dictatorships in the 1970s.</span>
