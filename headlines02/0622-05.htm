<p>Millions saw the horrific images of the World Trade Center attacks, and those 
who saw them won't forget them. But a New Jersey homemaker saw something that 
morning that prompted an investigation into five young Israelis and their possible 
connection to Israeli intelligence.
<p>Maria, who asked us not to use her last name, had a view of the World Trade 
Center from her New Jersey apartment building. She remembers a neighbor calling 
her shortly after the first plane hit the towers.
<p> She grabbed her binoculars and watched the destruction unfolding in lower 
Manhattan. But as she watched the disaster, something else caught her eye.
<p> Maria says she saw three young men kneeling on the roof of a white van in 
the parking lot of her apartment building. "They seemed to be taking a movie," 
Maria said.
<p> The men were taking video or photos of themselves with the World Trade Center 
burning in the background, she said. What struck Maria were the expressions on 
the men's faces. "They were like happy, you know &#133; They didn't look shocked 
to me. I thought it was very strange," she said. 
<p> She found the behavior so suspicious that she wrote down the license plate 
number of the van and called the police. Before long, the FBI was also on the 
scene, and a statewide bulletin was issued on the van. 
<p> The plate number was traced to a van owned by a company called Urban Moving. 
Around 4 p.m. on Sept. 11, the van was spotted on a service road off Route 3, 
near New Jersey's Giants Stadium. A police officer pulled the van over, finding 
five men, between 22 and 27 years old, in the vehicle. The men were taken out 
of the van at gunpoint and handcuffed by police. 
<p> The arresting officers said they saw a lot that aroused their suspicion about 
the men. One of the passengers had $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock. Another 
was carrying two foreign passports. A box cutter was found in the van. But perhaps 
the biggest surprise for the officers came when the five men identified themselves 
as Israeli citizens.
<p><span class="subhead"><b>&#145;We Are Not Your Problem&#146;</b></span>
<p> According to the police report, one of the passengers told the officers they 
had been on the West Side Highway in Manhattan "during the incident" &#151; referring 
to the World Trade Center attack. The driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told 
the officers, "We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our 
problems. The Palestinians are the problem." The other passengers were his brother 
Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner and Omer Marmari. 
<p> When the men were transferred to jail, the case was transferred out of the 
FBI's Criminal Division, and into the bureau's Foreign Counterintelligence Section, 
which is responsible for espionage cases, ABCNEWS has learned. 
<p> One reason for the shift, sources told ABCNEWS, was that the FBI believed 
Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation. 
<p> After the five men were arrested, the FBI got a warrant and searched Urban 
Moving's Weehawken, N.J., offices. 
<p> The FBI searched Urban Moving's offices for several hours, removing boxes 
of documents and a dozen computer hard drives. The FBI also questioned Urban Moving's 
owner. His attorney insists that his client answered all of the FBI's questions. 
But when FBI agents tried to interview him again a few days later, he was gone. 
<p> Three months later <I>2020's</I> cameras photographed the inside of Urban 
Moving, and it looked as if the business had been shut down in a big hurry. Cell 
phones were lying around; office phones were still connected; and the property 
of dozens of clients remained in the warehouse. 
<p> The owner had also cleared out of his New Jersey home, put it up for sale 
and returned with his family to Israel.
<p><span class="subhead"><b>&#145;A Scary Situation&#146;</b></span>
<p> Steven Gordon, the attorney for the five Israeli detainees, acknowledged that 
his clients' actions on Sept. 11 would easily have aroused suspicions. "You got 
a group of guys that are taking pictures, on top of a roof, of the World Trade 
Center. They're speaking in a foreign language. They got two passports on 'em. 
One's got a wad of cash on him, and they got box cutters. Now that's a scary situation." 
<p> But Gordon insisted that his clients were just five young men who had come 
to America for a vacation, ended up working for a moving company, and were taking 
pictures of the event. 
<p> The five Israelis were held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, 
ostensibly for overstaying their tourist visas and working in the United States 
illegally. Two weeks after their arrest, an immigration judge ordered them to 
be deported. But sources told ABCNEWS that FBI and CIA officials in Washington 
put a hold on the case. 
<p> The five men were held in detention for more than two months. Some of them 
were placed in solitary confinement for 40 days, and some of them were given as 
many as seven lie-detector tests.
<p><span class="subhead"><b>'Plenty of Speculation'</b></span>
<p> Since their arrest, plenty of speculation has swirled about the case, and 
what the five men were doing that morning. Eventually, <I>The Forward</i>, a respected 
Jewish newspaper in New York, reported the FBI concluded that two of the men were 
Israeli intelligence operatives. 
<p> Vince Cannistraro, a former chief of operations for counterterrorism with 
the CIA who is now a consultant for ABCNEWS, said federal authorities' interest 
in the case was heightened when some of the men's names were found in a search 
of a national intelligence database.
<p><span class="subhead"><b>Israeli Intelligence Connection?</b></span>
<p> According to Cannistraro, many people in the U.S. intelligence community believed 
that some of the men arrested were working for Israeli intelligence. Cannistraro 
said there was speculation as to whether Urban Moving had been "set up or exploited 
for the purpose of launching an intelligence operation against radical Islamists 
in the area, particularly in the New Jersey-New York area." 
<p> Under this scenario, the alleged spying operation was not aimed against the 
United States, but at penetrating or monitoring radical fund-raising and support 
networks in Muslim communities like Paterson, N.J., which was one of the places 
where several of the hijackers lived in the months prior to Sept. 11. 
<p> For the FBI, deciphering the truth from the five Israelis proved to be difficult. 
One of them, Paul Kurzberg, refused to take a lie-detector test for 10 weeks &#151; 
then failed it, according to his lawyer. Another of his lawyers told us Kurzberg 
had been reluctant to take the test because he had once worked for Israeli intelligence 
in another country. 
<p> Sources say the Israelis were targeting these fund-raising networks because 
they were thought to be channeling money to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, groups that 
are responsible for most of the suicide bombings in Israel. "[The] Israeli government 
has been very concerned about the activity of radical Islamic groups in the United 
States that could be a support apparatus to Hamas and Islamic Jihad," Cannistraro 
said.
<p> The men denied that they had been working for Israeli intelligence out of 
the New Jersey moving company, and Ram Horvitz, their Israeli attorney, dismissed 
the allegations as "stupid and ridiculous." 
<p> Mark Regev, the spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, goes even 
further, asserting the issue was never even discussed with U.S. officials.
<P> "These five men were not involved in any intelligence operation in the United 
States, and the American intelligence authorities have never raised this issue 
with us," Regev said. "The story is simply false."
<p><span class="subhead"><b>No &#145;Pre-Knowledge&#146;</b></span>
<p> Despite the denials, sources tell ABCNEWS there is still debate within the 
FBI over whether or not the young men were spies. Many U.S. government officials 
still believe that some of them were on a mission for Israeli intelligence. But 
the FBI told ABCNEWS, "To date, this investigation has not identified anybody 
who in this country had pre-knowledge of the events of 9/11." 
<p> Sources also said that even if the men were spies, there is no evidence to 
conclude they had advance knowledge of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. The 
investigation, at the end of the day, after all the polygraphs, all of the field 
work, all the cross-checking, the intelligence work, concluded that they probably 
did not have advance knowledge of 9/11," Cannistraro noted. 
<p> As to what they were doing on the van, they say they read about the attack 
on the Internet, couldn't see it from their offices and went to the parking lot 
for a better view. But no one has been able to find a good explanation for why 
they may have been smiling with the towers of the World Trade Center burning in 
the background. Both the lawyers for the young men and the Israeli Embassy chalk 
it up to immature conduct. 
<p> According to ABCNEWS sources, Israeli and U.S. government officials worked 
out a deal &#151; and after 71 days, the five Israelis were taken out of jail, 
put on a plane, and deported back home. 
<p> While the former detainees refused to answer ABCNEWS' questions about their 
detention and what they were doing on Sept. 11, several of the detainees discussed 
their experience in America on an Israeli talk show after their return home. 
<p> Said one of the men, denying that they were laughing or happy on the morning 
of Sept. 11, "The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences 
terror daily. Our purpose was to document the event."
