<p>A judge who voted to make the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional in a ruling 
last week has criticized his court's legally inconsequential decision to put the 
ruling on hold. 
<P>The 2-1 ruling last Wednesday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco declared the pledge unconstitutional in classrooms as a government 
endorsement of religion, because of its reference to "one nation under God." On 
Thursday, Judge Alfred Goodwin, author of the opinion, issued a stay that prevents 
the ruling from taking effect until the court disposes of all appeals. 
<P>Under court rules, however, the ruling would not have become binding for at 
least 52 days and would have been stayed indefinitely as soon as an appeal was 
filed. 
<P>The federal and state governments and a school district are currently preparing 
appeals to the ruling. 
<P>Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who joined Goodwin in the majority decision, said 
Monday that he had written an internal memo taking the court to task for the stay. 
<P>The memo, quoted in the Daily Journal legal newspaper, said the court lacked 
"the courage of its convictions" and was merely trying to pacify politicians and 
the public. "I am embarrassed for myself and our court," Reinhardt wrote. 
<P>Reached at his chambers in Los Angeles, he said he would not comment publicly 
on the stay, but he would not dispute a reporter's characterization of it as "a 
gesture without legal meaning." 
<P>"When a court issues an order, it's supposed to do something," Reinhardt said. 
<P>Goodwin did not return The Chronicle's phone calls Monday, but was quoted by 
the Recorder, another legal newspaper, as saying the stay was simply "damage control" 
largely for the benefit of news organizations that don't understand court rules. 
<P>"Their attention span can't handle anything more than a haiku of about four 
lines," said the 79-year-old judge, a former newspaper reporter who was appointed 
to the court by President Richard Nixon in 1971. "The worst thing about it was 
that some people said we were caving under pressure." 
<P>Goodwin was no more complimentary about politicians in general, and President 
Bush in particular, who have taken turns beating up on the ruling and the court 
that issued it. 
<P>"I never had much confidence in the attention span of elected officials for 
any kind of deep thinking about important issues," the judge told the Recorder.</p>
