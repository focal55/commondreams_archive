BERKELEY -- A rainy day of protest on the University of California, Berkeley, campus between students supporting Palestine and those backing Israel ended peacefully late Tuesday with the arrest of 79 demonstrators and a march by students through downtown Berkeley.

</font>Several groups on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were present at Sproul Plaza, but Capt. Bill Cooper of the UC Berkeley police said there was no violence. "Some conversations got a little heated," Cooper said. "But nothing happened." 
<P>It was the largest rally on Sproul since the affirmative action demonstrations a few years ago. UC police said about 800 students were on Sproul at noon, two-thirds supporting Palestine. However, other observers estimated the crowd at well over 1,000. </P>
<P>The arrests came inside Wheeler Hall, where Students for Justice in Palestine and supporters from around Berkeley held a three-hour sit-in. All but one protester were cited for trespassing and released. </P>
<P>UC Berkeley student Roberto Hernandez, 23, was arrested for biting an officer and booked into Berkeley City Jail for felony assault about 5 p.m. He was released on $5,000 bail a short
while later. UC Berkeley Vice Chancellor John Cummins said the university made the arrests because the students were given ample warning about occupying academic buildings. </P>
<P>"UC views this as a serious violation of the Code of Conduct." </P>
<P>UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl said he was pleased the observances were conducted in a mostly civil manner. But he said he was disappointed about the disruption at Wheeler Hall. </P>
<P>It was potentially a difficult day. For Jews it was the Yom Hashoah, the Day of Remembrance of Hitler's Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews died. Students from Hillel, the Jewish campus life center, spent 24 hours reading the names of some of those who perished. </P>
<P>Less than 100 yards away, Students for Justice in Palestine gathered to commemorate the 1948 Deir Yassin massacre of about 100 Palestinians and to demand that UC Regents divest investments in Israel. </P>
<P>After the arrest of Hernandez, about 100 students -- some carrying Palestinian flags, others wearing black and white Palestinian head scarves -- marched to the new Berkeley police headquarters. </P>
<P>They were greeted by a line of Berkeley police officers in riot gear behind a barricade across Milvia Street. Students peacefully passed a collection cup for bail money. </P>
<P>Students tried to cross the barrier with the bail, but police pushed them back. A group remained outside the barrier until Hernandez was freed. </P>
<P>A similar demonstration was held at San Francisco State University Tuesday. A spokesperson said about 800 students attended, and then several hundred marched down 19th Avenue outside campus, stopping traffic. </P>
<P>San Francisco police said there were no arrests. </P>

</font>Students then came to the Berkeley campus. "While millions march in the Middle East supporting Palestine, young Palestinian-Americans like myself feel we should march too," said San Francisco State student John Saudi. 
<P>When the noon protest at UC Berkeley began, Sproul Plaza was a mass of flags and signs -- some bluntly calling for Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank, others simply urging peace in the troubled land. </P>
<P>A group of a hundred or more Jewish students and supporters of Israel stood at the fringe of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators, separated by faculty and student observers. Many carried signs saying the terrorists the Israeli army was seeking would attack America next. </P>
<P>Several in the Jewish group carried Israeli flags and there were verbal confrontations between Palestinian and Israeli supporters. Each time an argument began, television and newspaper photographers swooped in. </P>
<P>There was one especially tense moment. A pro-Palestinian speaker expressed his support for Jews who died during the Holocaust. Then he began saying the Khaddish, the Jewish prayer for those who have died. That brought angry shouts from pro-Israel students. </P>
<P>Many more students stood and watched and did not participate. </P>
<P>Bystander Erika Nyhus said the Palestinian demonstration being held on the same day was insensitive. "It wasn't a secret that Jewish students planned this today," she said. </P>
<P>However, a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, Will Youmans, said the Palestinian massacre remembrance is always held on April 9. </P>
<P>"It's not about ethnic nationalism, Jews or Palestinians," he said. </P>
<P>But he also called Israel an apartheid state that discriminates against Palestinians. </P>
<P>That's why the Students for Justice supports UC divestment of investments in Israel, he said. </P>
<P>After the noon rally, about 600 protesters, some carrying signs, a few wheeling their babies in strollers, marched through Sather Gate and around the Bancroft Library before charging into Wheeler. </P>
<P>Students rushed down the halls, disrupting classes, then jammed the lobby on the first floor. A half hour later, campus police barred Wheeler's front doors, trapping protesters inside. </P>
<P>Undeterred, the rest of the group massed in front of the building and continued the rally. </P>
<P>"We've got speakers, we've got dancers, we've got someone from Jerusalem, so stick around," said organizer Noura Erakat. </P>
<P>Mike Froehlich, a first year Boalt Hall law student, said he was protesting because he thinks UC should get rid of its Israel investments. </P>
<P>"I pay thousands of dollars in tuition, a portion of which is used to buy stock, which supports atrocities in Israel. Policy makers need to know there is opposition." </P>
<P>The scene on campus was slightly incongruous. The annual Associated Students election began Tuesday, and candidates, many carrying signs, circulated through the plaza. </P>
<P>One young man in a tie-dyed t-shirt urged a vote for the "Woodstock Party." Sajid Khan, a candidate on the "Goatmilk" Party slate, strolled through Sproul, leading a goat. </P>
<P>As the day ended on Sproul, a young Sephardic Jew from San Lorenzo provided the closing note. Daniel Fernandez said he learned about the Palestinian protest and came to support Jews and Israel. </P>
<P>He blows his ram's horn or shofar at his synagogue during on the Jewish New Year and he brought it along Tuesday. </P>
<P>So, as the rain came down and the demonstrators marched away, Fernandez blew a long, sad note on the horn. It echoed around Sproul Plaza, empty exept for the group of students still reciting the names of the long ago dead.</P>
