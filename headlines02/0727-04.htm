<p> “WE lost. They lost. Everyone lost,” the Israeli soldier concludes from on 
top of his armored vehicle, waving vaguely at the smoking remains of Jenin behind 
him. “It’s one of those really original football matches that both teams lose.” 
<P>The scene is from <I>Jenin Diary: The Inside Story</I> — a documentary shot 
by an Israeli reservist from the company that lost 13 soldiers in a Palestinian 
ambush in Jenin refugee camp on April 9. 
<P>Its maker, Gil Mezuman, 30, shot 40 hours of film on a hand-held camera, cut 
to 65 minutes for its premiere before a capacity audience at the Jerusalem Film 
Festival. 
<P>One of the final scenes shows his disorientated unit wandering aimlessly around 
its camp, still traumatized after the deaths a few days earlier. 
<P>Some of those filmed openly question the tactics used, and even the Army’s 
right to be in Jenin. Others can no longer fight a campaign in which they no longer 
believe. 
<P>“Personally, I’m finished with the Army. The next reserve call, I won’t be 
here,” vows ponytailed Altshuler, unable to forgive himself for not challenging 
the orders that led his commander and friends to their deaths. 
<P>“Those who believe in it, let them continue,” mutters Kobi, insisting that 
he will never again be a combat soldier. “I’ll do what I believe in.” 
<P>A filmmaker and cameraman by profession, Mr Mezuman and his unit were sent 
to Jenin after the Passover suicide bombing which killed 29 Israelis in Netanya 
and launched Israel’s huge military invasion of the West Bank. 
<P>Assigned to a camp outside Jenin during the first eight days of savage house-to-house 
combat, he was not present at the ambush. It was the Israeli military’s subsequent 
decision to switch tactics and raze houses with armored bulldozers that led to 
howls of international outrage, although allegations of a massacre were undermined 
later by the final official death toll of 23 Israelis and 52 Palestinians. 
<P>The film shows survivors in shock: thousand-yard stares, forgotten cigarettes 
smoldering between fingers, and heads slumped as the soldiers learn that they 
must postpone their grief because they are being sent straight back into Jenin. 
<P>One man, lying in a hospital bed, giggles as he recalls pulling out a grenade 
to kill two Palestinians searching the house below him, then frantically trying 
to push the pin back in as he realized he was about to slip into unconsciousness 
and blow himself up. 
<P>It also portrays the soul-searching of articulate, well educated reservists 
willing to expose every detail of their unit’s performance to minute scrutiny 
in an internal inquiry they insist on holding. Although cleared by the Israeli 
censors, with deletions to protect operating procedures and a tantalizing hint 
of drug-taking, it contains searing criticisms of the Israeli military machine. 
<P>What it lacks, crucially, is footage of the ambush itself and anything outside 
the Israeli military perspective. Jenin is glimpsed only occasionally as the company 
moves hastily through the shattered streets, or from from windows through which 
Israeli soldiers spray gunfire, and no Palestinian appears in the entire film. 
<P>Time and again the soldiers question why they were not better equipped and 
why they did not have dogs to detect the explosives that killed the commander, 
Oded Colomb, and their friends as they cleared a booby-trapped house. 
<P>There are also bitter complaints that the Army appeared to have been taken 
by surprise by the level of Palestinian resistance, and had prepared as if for 
“a drill”. 
<P>“It is unclear what motivated Oded to move down those alleyways at that particular 
time. It is unclear why a reserve division entered Jenin and it is unclear why 
the Army conquered Palestinian land,” the platoon commander, Avner, tells the 
camera. 
<P>Others angrily accuse the skeptics of being “wise guys after the fact” and 
forgetting the suicide bombings that killed 100 Israeli civilians in the month 
before Jenin. 
<P>“Life isn’t black and white, there is lots of grey in between,” shouts one 
religious reservist at his disaffected colleagues. “Each day without Israeli casualties 
is our victory.” 
<P>Mr Mezuman said: “The film is about our trauma; if we were prepared properly; 
if we did well. Many of us had feelings of guilt and fear about surviving when 
others died, and some are clearly in shock. 
<P>“I have given our point of view of the war. If you want to understand the full 
story, you need to see the two sides. I know there are two stories, but I can 
only tell my own.”</p> </P>
