<p>Gerhard Schr&ouml;der has told Germans that a vote for him is a vote against 
war in Iraq, as he urgently seeks a "big idea" in his fight for a second term 
as chancellor.</p>

<p>Ahead of today's launch of the "hot phase" of his Social Democrat Party (SPD) 
election campaign - brought forward three weeks because of the SPD's alarming 
slide in the polls - Mr Schr&ouml;der told a party rally he would not support 
American "adventures" in Iraq nor provide a single euro to fund them.</p>
<p>In a clear criticism of Washington's current policy that he hoped would appeal 
to Germany's pacifist majority, he said: "Whoever goes in has to know why he goes 
there and what he wants there.</p>
<p>"I can only warn against discussing a war in Iraq without thinking about the 
political consequences and without having a clear political concept for the entire 
Middle East."</p>
<p>Referring to the Gulf war, when Germany helped to finance the campaign, though 
it provided no troops, he said: "Such a division of responsibility, which says 
'The Germans are not there but they pay', does not exist any more, at least not 
with me."</p>
<p>The comments represented a definite hardening of anti-American attitudes.</p>
<p>Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister and a member of the Social Democrats' 
coalition partners, the Greens, went even further saying it was a "wrong priority" 
to try to bring about a change of regime in Iraq "with an armed intervention in 
Baghdad".</p>
<p>The decision to put foreign affairs at the forefront of campaigning for next 
month's election was seized on by Mr Schr&ouml;der's rival from the centre-Right, 
Edmund Stoiber - as well as independent commentators - as proof that he was dodging 
domestic matters, including unemployment and Germany's sluggish economic growth.</p>
<p>Mr Stoiber said: "This is a red herring to hide essential issues that have 
not been dealt with or solved."</p>
<p>Mr Stoiber has tended to be cautiously supportive of US policy over Iraq. Wolfgang 
Sch&auml;uble, the centre-Right foreign policy spokesman, rejected Mr Schr&ouml;der's 
attempt to brand the Christian Democrats and Mr Stoiber's Bavarian Christian Social 
Union as warmongers.</p>
<p>No decisions needed to be made now on German participation in a conflict in 
Iraq, he said. "We will cross that bridge when we come to it."</p>
<p>After a month in which Mr Schr&ouml;der has sacked his defence minister, Rudolf 
Scharping, and been under heavy pressure over the economy and political scandals 
involving party members, the SPD has suffered a potentially fatal slide in the 
polls.</p>
<p>Most surveys now show them six points behind the centre-Right opposition parties 
led by Mr Stoiber, who seem on course to form a coalition government with the 
pro-business liberal FDP who are on nine per cent. Some pollsters have written 
the SPD off already.</p>
<p>Mr Schr&ouml;der's advisers had been pinning their hopes on the media-friendly 
chancellor winning through because he has more "nice guy" appeal than Mr Stoiber. 
But his personal ratings, as well as those of his party, have begun to dip following 
the chaos of recent weeks.</p>
<p>The SPD's latest hope seems to be to play on Germans' fear of returning to 
war or of finding some last minute skeleton in the Stoiber cupboard.</p>
<p>According to an opinion poll by Forsa, 84 per cent of Germans reject the idea 
of their country participating in a conflict in Iraq, with only 13 per cent supporting 
it.</p>
<p>Today Mr Schr&ouml;der will send his party's election battle bus on its way 
across the country three weeks earlier than originally planned.</p>
<p>By mid-week more bad news on unemployment is expected, with experts predicting 
July's figure will show a monthly rise of 100,000 to more than four million. The 
total normally falls in the summer months.</p>
