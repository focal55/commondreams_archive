<p>BUOYED by this week's congressional election victory, George W. Bush has turned 
up the heat on Saddam Hussein with a push for the UN Security Council to vote 
this week on a tough new resolution demanding Iraq disarm or face war.
<p> The US announced yesterday it wanted a vote tomorrow on its resolution requiring 
Iraq to own up and destroy its weapons of mass destruction or suffer "serious 
consequences". Mr Bush, who argued strongly for the need to disarm Iraq as he 
campaigned for Republican candidates, can claim Tuesday's strong election result 
for conservatives has underlined voters' backing for a possible war. 
<p> Now, after two months of negotiating, the President is calling on France, 
Russia and China in the Security Council to back the joint US-British plan for 
a new inspection program backed by the prospect of military force.
<p> In a concession to France, the US resolution would not authorise automatic 
use of military force if Iraq fails to comply with the terms set by the UN, but 
instead calls for a meeting by the Security Council to consider action.
<p> Regardless of the Security Council's decision, the US could act alone or with 
allies.
<p> Democrats and Republicans agreed one of the messages from the Republicans' 
resounding election win was that the President's high-profile campaigning had 
made the election, in part, a referendum on the war on terrorism.
<P> "It means that the President has an opportunity here to enact and proceed 
with the plan (on Iraq) as he has articulated it," said Tom Daschle, who lost 
his position as Senate leader when Republicans won back the majority. "The American 
people appear now to give him the benefit of the doubt."
<P> Republican Trent Lott, who takes the Senate leader's position, said the election 
that defied much historical precedent by increasing the number of seats held by 
a President's party, was a referendum on Mr Bush's leadership. "The American people 
said, 'Yes, we trust this man'," he said. 
<P> While the Democrat-run Senate had passed a resolution granting Mr Bush the 
right to go to war with Iraq if necessary, the fact the Republicans now run the 
White House and both congressional chambers has given him even greater political 
backing.
<P> Some senior Russian politicians expressed concerns the election result would 
see a more aggressive US approach to Iraq.
<P> "Bush's position on Iraq can now only be stopped by the international community 
&#150; NATO, Russia and the major Arab states," said Alexei Arabatov, a leading 
liberal politician in the Duma.
<P> But Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the US was working to win 
international co-operation to disarm Iraq, "and I expect no change in that stance".
<P> War could come soon, with UN inspectors likely to be sent back to Iraq within 
10 days of the resolution being passed.
<P> If Iraq refused to comply with the requirements of the resolution &#150; such 
as failing to list all its weapons programs within 30 days, or blocking the inspectors 
&#150; it would cross a "red line", US Secretary of State Colin Powell said this 
week.
<P> A new concern expressed by French, Russian and Chinese diplomats centres on 
the question of who would decide if the "red line" had been crossed.
<P> These diplomats believe that the weapons inspectors must be the ones to accuse 
Iraq of a breach of the resolution, and report back to the Security Council for 
action. 
<P> But new language in the US resolution could allow Washington to circumvent 
the arms inspectors, by itself reporting to the UN.</P>
