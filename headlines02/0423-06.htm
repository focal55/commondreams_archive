International pressure on Israel to explain its army's conduct during the invasion of Jenin's refugee camp grew yesterday after Amnesty International accused it of "very serious human rights abuses", and called for a war crimes investigation.
<p>The human rights group said that it reached the preliminary conclusion there was evidence of crimes, including extra-judicial executions and the use of human shields.</p>
<p>Javier Zuniga, Amnesty's regional director, said: "We have concluded, on a preliminary basis, that very serious violations of human rights were committed. We are talking here [about] possible war crimes. We believe Israel has a case to answer."</p>
<p>Kofi Annan, United Nations secretary general, has named a three-member fact-finding team led by the ex-Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari to determine what happened during Israel's assault on the Jenin camp in the West Bank. The other two members are Cornelio Sommaruga, former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Sadako Ogata, the former UN high commissioner for refugees who is Japan's special envoy on Afghan reconstruction.</p>
<p>Mr Ahtisaari said he hoped the team would arrive in the West Bank later this week.</p>
<p>Israel's government has launched a public relations drive to counter the persistent allegations of atrocities, and to convince the world that its military offensive in Jenin was a legitimate counter-terrorism operation, aimed at ending a wave of suicide bombings.</p>
<p>An Israeli Foreign Office official acknowledged yesterday that a "terrible tragedy" occurred in Jenin but placed the blame on Palestinian militants, saying they had endangered civilians by manufacturing rockets and setting numerous booby-traps in the heart of the camp.</p>
<p>Kathleen Cavanaugh, an expert in international law with Amnesty, said the group had gathered statements from witnesses saying the army had executed a number of people, particularly at the early stage of the operation. That matches accounts gathered by <i>The lndependent</i>.</p>
<p>The offensive began on 2 April and led to days of intense fighting in which 23 Israeli soldiers were killed and an unknown number of Palestinians. More than 40 bodies have been recovered from the scene, including at least three women, a 10-year-old and an elderly man.</p>
<p>A 12-person British search and rescue team of disaster specialists, Rapid UK, pulled four more unidentifiable bodies out of the rubble but said it doubted there were more. It is due to leave today, after 48 hours A large number of people are still searching for their loved ones, prompting Palestinian suspicions that bodies were removed elsewhere during the six days the army banned aid agencies and the media from the area.</p>
<p>Amnesty said it had testimony that old people and children were caught up in the fighting and given no chance to flee &#150; a claim disputed by the Israeli army, which says it did everything possible to protect civilian lives after its forces entered the camp, home to 13,000 people.</p>
<p>Amnesty said it found no evidence of mass graves &#150; an allegation made by Palestinians &#150; but there were reports of the use of civilians as human shields.</p>
<p>It dismissed Israel's claims that the Palestinians killed in Jenin were mostly fighters. This was "simply not true", said Professor Derrick Pounder, a forensic medicine specialist from Dundee University, "In Jenin, there have certainly been mass killings &#150; both combatants and civilians."</p>
<p>Smarting from the international backlash, Israel has trained its ire on Terje Roed-Larsen, the UN's Middle East envoy who infuriated Ariel Sharon and his ministers by describing the scene at Jenin as "horrifying beyond belief" and a "blot on the history of the state of Israel".</p>
<p>He has been engulfed by a tide of condemnation from the highest levels of government, including calls for him to be made <i>persona non grata</i>. One member of Mr Sharon's government denounced him as "a racist, an anti-Semite and an apparent criminal". Mr Larsen said he stood by his words.</p>
<p>Attention will now focus on the fact-finding team Its inquiries will include trying to establish why the Israeli army refused to allow ambulances to enter the devastated area. </p>
