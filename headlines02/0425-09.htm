NEW YORK   - 
A U.S. judge on Thursday said he is
prepared to rule the federal death penalty unconstitutional but
will give the government a "last opportunity" to convince him
otherwise.
<p>

An unconstitutionality ruling would apply only in the
Southern District of New York, which covers Manhattan and the
Bronx. It would not apply to the death penalty in individual
states.
<p>
Judge Jed Rakoff of the Manhattan federal court gave U.S.
Justice Department lawyers until May 15 to argue whether
retaining capital punishment as a means of deterrence and
retribution "can constitutionally justify the knowing execution
of innocent persons."
<p>
The judge issued his opinion at a time when death penalty
opponents are growing more vocal, and even some supporters are
calling for greater procedural safeguards.
<p>
The issue arose in a narcotics and murder case in which two
of eight defendants, Alan Quinones and Diego Rodriguez, pleaded
not guilty. The government sought the death penalty for both
defendants in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 2,
the opinion said.
<p>
"It's obviously a very bold step on the judge's part," said
Robert Pugsley, a professor at the Southwestern University
School of Law in Los Angeles and a death penalty supporter.
"Certainly his order will be appealed to the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals, which in my view is likely to strike down his
order as premature because the case has not yet begun."
<p>
DUE PROCESS
<p>
Lawyers for the defendants sought to dismiss the death
penalty aspects of the case, arguing that innocent people could
be put to death before techniques, such as DNA testing, or
other evidence may later emerge and establish innocence.
<p>
"We now know, in a way almost unthinkable even a decade
ago, that our system of criminal justice, for all its
protections, is sufficiently fallible that innocent people are
convicted of capital crimes with some frequency," wrote Rakoff,
appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton.
<p>
The judge called "no longer ... tenable" the U.S. Supreme
Court's implicit assumption in a 1993 case, Herrera v. Collins,
that evidentiary and procedural safeguards and the appeals
process would render "highly unlikely" that an executed person
would later be found innocent.
<p>
The "state-sponsored death of a meaningful number of
innocent people" could deprive those people of due process, the
judge said. Accordingly, "if the court were compelled to decide
the issue today, it would ... dismiss all death penalty aspects
of this case on the ground that the federal death penalty
statute is unconstitutional," he said.
<p>
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York,
Marvin Smilon, said, "We're reviewing the opinion." He declined
further comment.
<p>
"HAD ITS CHANCE"
<p>
Kevin McNally, a death penalty defense specialist at
Frankfort, Kentucky-based McNally & O'Donnell who represents
Quinones, hailed the judge's opinion.
<p>
"The modern death penalty has had its chance over the last
25 years and has produced repeated death sentences for innocent
citizens," he said. "It's about time that a judge tackled this
distressing development. I wouldn't be surprised if the
government appealed."
<p>
Pugsley said he shares Rakoff's concerns about executing
innocent people, and that "the national concerns expressed in
his order are shared by many Americans, even those who support
the death penalty.
<p>
Still, he said, "I don't believe this particular court's
initiative will stand up."
<p>
The Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
There have been 770 U.S. death sentences carried out since
then, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, and
McNally said 100 innocent people have been freed from death row
over that time.
<p>
Earlier this month an Illinois task force set up by
Republican Gov. George Ryan urged imposing procedural and other
safeguards to ensure that death sentences be imposed more
fairly. The governor in 2000 suspended executions after several
death-row inmates were found to be innocent.
<p>
Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws on their books,
but the American Bar Association has called for a national
moratorium on executions.
