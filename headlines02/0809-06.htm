<p>THE World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg could be the summit 
that ends all summits. Not because it has any chance of succeeding in its Olympian 
aims of ending deprivation in the world while protecting its environment, but 
because most analysts expect it to be such a dire failure that few people will 
want to repeat it. 
<P>Apart from British ministers, descending on the troubled South African city 
for nine days will be 65,000 other delegates including 100 world leaders, UN representatives, 
journalists, pressure groups, oil firms and multinational companies. 
<P>Michael Meacher, the Environment Minister, said yesterday that the summit was 
essential. “The world is in a very serious state. By the middle of the century 
we will need two planets in order to sustain the standard of living that is used 
by many people in the developed countries, and wanted by people in developing 
countries. 
<P>“There are not two planets, there is only one. We are heading for a serious 
crisis in the next century.” 
<P>Despite such needs, however, and the agreeable communiqué that is sure to be 
released at the end of the summit, many of the pressure groups that are keenest 
for it to succeed say that it is almost certain not to save a single plant or 
a single human life. 
<P>The mood of inevitable failure that is descending on delegates is summed up 
by one poignant fact: George Bush, the most powerful man in the world and key 
to any agreements, is widely expected not to bother showing up. 
<P>Politicians say, however, that failure — raising hopes in the developing world 
and then dashing them — would destabilize global politics for years to come, sparking 
off tensions and waves of migration from the poor world to the rich on a scale 
far exceeding what has been seen so far. 
<P>The summit is officially “Rio plus ten”, an international meeting that was 
agreed upon during the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, which set in train efforts to combat 
global warming, culminating in the Kyoto treaty. Its aims, however, are as much 
about development as saving the environment. The official texts have meandered 
through a series of preparatory meetings between officials and politicians during 
the past year, but have come down to five key areas: water, energy, health, agriculture 
and biodiversity. 
<P>The aim is to bring safe drinking water to 1.2 billion people who do not have 
access to it, and give proper sanitation to the 2.4 billion who are deprived of 
that. Everyone should have access to electricity, preferably from renewable sources, 
and not have to rely on burning wood to cook food. 
<P>Illegal logging should be stopped. Basic healthcare, such as immunization and 
vaccination, should be made available to all, and dangerous chemicals should be 
eliminated. Multinational corporations could be brought to heel, with agreements 
ensuring that they uphold basic human rights and work conditions wherever they 
operate. 
<P>But the preparatory talks have shown just how weak the political will is to 
reach any of these aims. The US has made clear that it will not sign any new global 
agreements, and the talk now is not of binding treaties but voluntary agreements 
by which companies or countries could abide if they want — something they are 
free to do already. Western governments have also made clear that they are not 
prepared to hand over any more money to achieve these aims. 
<P>Many of the issues that are of greatest concern to the developing world have 
also been declared off-limits. Western governments have said that they are not 
prepared to talk about relief for those countries that have the biggest debts, 
and nor will they talk about further opening up their markets to products from 
the developing world. 
<P>Kevin Watkins, Oxfam’s head of policy, said: “There is no cause for optimism. 
If you look at the statement they are lining to sign up to, it is vacuous and 
devoid of content. It is long on principles, but short of any ways of implementing 
them. The northern governments have just turned it into a giant public relations 
exercise.” 
<P>Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats’ Environment spokesman, said that 60,000 
well-fed people coming to a part of the world devastated by Aids and famine and 
agreeing to do nothing would send out a damaging message. He said: “It could have 
a very negative impact on the relationship between the Third World and the developed 
world by raising hopes and smashing them. If Johannesburg is a failure, and then 
a few months later you have the US blitzing Iraq, then by 2003 we could have a 
very unstable global situation, showing poor countries that the rich don’t want 
to help them.” 
<P>Klaus Toepfler, head of the UN’s environment program, added: “Unless a new 
course is charted for planet Earth we risk a new iron curtain, dividing not East 
and West, but the haves and the have-nots. There will be increased tensions, jealousies 
and hatred between and within countries.” 
<P>Mr Bruce said that failure would ensure that the problems of the Third World 
were visited on the West more than ever before. “If people suffering poverty, 
lack of water and food have no hope of a better life, it’s the most natural human 
instinct to go where you can get it, and it’s far easier for them to come here. 
It will lead to mass migration, far bigger than anything we have now: you’re not 
talking about 100,000 asylum-seekers, but 500,000. One way or another, their problems 
will wash up on us.”<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>On and off the agenda<BR>
<BR>
Water: </STRONG>1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water; 2.4 billion 
lack proper sanitation. The proposal is to halve that by 2015, with the developing 
world producing strategies to achieve that target by 2005. 
<P><STRONG>Energy: </STRONG>More than 2 billion people have no access to modern 
energy, principally electricity. The aim is to spread the use of electricity while 
increasing the share that is produced from renewable sources. 
<P><STRONG>Health: </STRONG>Everyone should be given access to basic healthcare, 
including essential drugs and immunization
<P><STRONG>Biodiversity: </STRONG>One proposal is to halt the loss of biodiversity 
— the number of different habitats, plants and animals — by 2010. Governments 
are promising to take further action to combat illegal logging and to support 
conservation efforts in the developing world. 
<P><STRONG>Not on the table: </STRONG>These include the issue of relief for highly 
indebted nations, and giving poor nations greater access to the markets of the 
West, allowing them to sell their goods more easily.</p>
