<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human rights and relief organizations are voicing growing concerns over the prospects for restoring stability in Afghanistan, even as the long-awaited <i>loya jirga</i>, or grand council, prepares to convene Tuesday in Kabul to elect a new transitional government that will replace the interim administration headed by Hamid Karzai since last December.
</font>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the United States government insists that the <i>loya jirga</i> process will help stabilize the country after eight years of Taliban rule and the U.S. military campaign that ousted it, a number of groups are warning that unless the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) extends its operations beyond Kabul, much of Afghanistan could fall once again into the clutches of warlords.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Moreover, several groups say that warlords with terrible records of human rights abuses have themselves used the <i>loya jirga</i> selection process to further their own ends, in part by ensuring their own participation in this week's deliberations in the capital city.
</font>
<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Warlords are making a power grab by brazenly manipulating the loya jirga selection process. If they succeed, Afghanis will again be denied the ability to choose their own leaders and build civil society," said Sam Zia-Zarifi, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW). "This is a make-or-break time for Afghanistan's future."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Adding to these concerns are serious shortfalls in aid from donor countries some of which are withholding assistance until they get a better fix on the security situation and how the new leadership is likely to deal with it, according to the Geneva-based International Organization of Migration (IOM), which, along with the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees, has helped repatriate hundreds of thousands of Afghans from exile in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



UN officials say they have received only about one third of what was pledged for Afghanistan at a donors' conference in Tokyo last January. The result is that both the UN and various relief agencies, like IOM, have been forced to trim their operations in the country.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



This is despite a preliminary report commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which found just two weeks ago that hunger remained so severe through drought-stricken areas of the country, that the sale by poor peasants of their daughters into marriage was "very routine." The report described the situation in Afghanistan as "still in acute disaster phase" five months after the Taliban were ousted from power.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The <i>loya jirga</i>, which has brought some 1,551 delegates to meet in Kabul over most of the coming week, is expected to elect Karzai as president of the new government and to confirm most of the current key ministers and deputy ministers in their positions for the two-year life of the transitional executive. It will also decide what powers, if any, will be given to the former king, Zahir Shah, who returned from 30 years in exile last month.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Most of the delegates have been chosen in local elections throughout the country, although some 500 seats, including 160 reserved for women and 100 others for refugees from abroad, were determined in advance.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Washington has held that the <i>loya jirga</i> process would help consolidate power across areas of the country which are currently vulnerable to what a number of relief organizations and HRW have described as increasing lawlessness and insecurity.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The administration of President George W. Bush has expressed concerns that expansion of the 4,500-troop ISAF beyond Kabul could interfere with U.S.-led military efforts to track down remaining Taliban and al-Qaeda forces.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The state department coordinator for Afghanistan, David Johnson, dismissed HRW's concerns this weekend, arguing that, while some areas of the country were "certainly unstable...there are many areas where this [<i>loya jirga</i> selection] process was conducted in a reasonable way."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



But Tom Malinowski, HRW's Washington director, told <i>The Washington Post</i> that Johnson was "short on realism and long on wishful thinking." The administration, he said, apparently believes that it "can build kinder, gentler warlords, but that's not going to happen."</font>
