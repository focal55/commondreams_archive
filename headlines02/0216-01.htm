WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Friday said yes to Yucca Mountain. Nevada leaders responded: hell no.

</font>The president selected the flattop ridge 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas to become the nation's burial ground for nuclear waste and directed his administration to continue working toward development of a repository there.
<p> "I consider the Yucca Mountain site qualified for an application for a construction authorization for a repository," Bush declared in a letter to congressional leaders in which he called for them to act "in an expedited and bipartisan fashion" to move the project forward.
</p>
<p> Bush said a Nevada repository will "enhance the safety and security of the nation as a whole." His spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said the president's decision was based on sound science.
</p>
<p> The intensity of reaction from Nevada made it clear that the state's leaders believe otherwise.
</p>
<p> Within hours, attorneys for Nevada filed a new lawsuit -- the third in nine months -- charging that the president's decision was based on a flawed recommendation by the Department of Energy and asking that it be set aside.
</p>
<p> Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., said she was promised by the chairman of the House Transportation Committee on Thursday that hearings will begin by June on nuclear waste transportation at locations around the country.
</p>
<p> Gov. Kenny Guinn, R-Nev., said he was developing a strategy to time his veto of the plan in a way that Congress might not be able to finalize the site selection this year. Once Guinn delivers his veto, lawmakers will have 90 legislative days to act.
</p>
<p> Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the president "lied" when he promised during the 2000 campaign to base his decision on "sound science, not politics."

The White House took exception to Reid's remarks, which he made on CNN.
<p> "I think you will see the president made a thoughtful decision based on sound science," presidential spokeswoman Nicolle Devenish said. "Senator Reid's disagreement on the science is a shameful excuse for a false personal attack against the president."
</p>
<p> The president's decision represented a major milestone in the effort to develop permanent storage for 77,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive nuclear waste, about half of which already has been gathering at 131 power plants and government facilities in 39 states.
</p>
<p> It also might be considered a significant date in Nevada history if the government is successful in its effort to bury the waste in a mountain that was formed 13 million years ago by volcanic ash that fell from the sky and flowed over the landscape.
</p>
<p> Jim Hulse, a retired University of Nevada, Reno history professor, said Yucca Mountain development would rank in state annals with the legalization of gambling in 1931, the formation of federal mining law in 1872 and the opening of the Nevada Test Site in 1951.
</p>
<p> The government has studied Yucca Mountain for 20 years, so far spending $7 billion on repository research. DOE estimates it could cost another $47 billion to build the facility and begin accepting waste for storage.
</p>
<p> Even under the most optimistic schedules, a repository wouldn't begin accepting waste until 2010.
</p>
<p> Having monitored the Energy Department's progress for more than a decade, Nevada leaders say the government has failed to prove that Yucca Mountain can stop radionuclides from escaping about 1,000 feet below the repository floor and into groundwater that flows to Death Valley, jeopardizing public health and safety.
</p>
<p> Bush, known for making quick and certain decisions, pulled the trigger on this one less than a day after receiving a formal recommendation from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.
</p>
<p> Late Thursday, Abraham delivered an 80-pound packet containing DOE scientific and environmental analyses of the site and a 46-page report explaining why he believed Yucca Mountain should proceed.
</p>
<p> Bush had asked his science adviser, John Marburger III, and James Connaughton, head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, "to take a wholly separate look" at what the Energy Department was presenting, Fleischer said.
</p>
<p> That review was completed before Abraham formally submitted his recommendation.
</p>
<p> Details of those reviews could not be learned on Friday, but they satisfied Bush. "As a result of what the president has received, the president does have a sufficient scientific basis to make a decision," Fleischer said shortly before the decision was announced.
</p>
<p> Bush echoed Abraham's recommendation in explaining his decision.
</p>
<p> The repository program is necessary to "protect public safety, health and the nation's security," he said, by isolating highly radioactive materials "now scattered throughout the nation."
</p>
<p> Bush, whose budget this year includes a new $38 million program to speed development of new reactors, also said "nuclear energy ... must remain a major component of our national energy policy in the years to come."
</p>
<p> It might be another two months before Congress can act. Guinn first must formally veto the president's decision, and he indicated he'll take close to the 60 days he is allowed by law.
</p>
<p> "I want to do it on the date that our lawyers and delegation believe will maximize our ability to best represent Nevada in this war of strategy," he said.</p>
<p> "It is going to be difficult," Guinn said of the road ahead. "I believe our best opportunity is in the courts." He said Nevada's chances of success in Congress are not good because it is "Nevada versus 39 other states," those with nuclear plants.
</p>
<p> In the courts, judges would have to listen to "facts and data" from Nevada and make a decision on that information, Guinn said.
</p>
<p> He said he believed the Bush administration violated the law by not giving him a copy of the final environmental impact statement on Yucca Mountain before making its decision. That is among the arguments state attorneys cited in the case filed on Friday evening.
</p>
<p> Guinn was told of Bush's decision in a brief 12:34 p.m. telephone conversation with Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card.
</p>
<p> Other elected Nevadans said they will redouble efforts on the politically potent issue.
</p>
<p> "As much as I was expecting this decision, it was still like a kick in the gut," Berkley said.
</p>
<p> Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., noted Yucca Mountain has been advanced by presidents and lawmakers of both parties.
</p>
<p> "I really think President Bush took our concerns into consideration," he said. "But the Department of Energy has been hell bent on shoving waste into our back yard."
</p>
<p> Similarly, Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., said DOE pulled one over on Bush.
</p>
<p> "They know and we know their science is faulty," he said. "They misled everyone, including the president, his administration and all the American public who believes Yucca Mountain is a good deal."
</p>
<p> Speaking to reporters on Friday, Abraham defended his recommendation. "It is my strong belief that the science supports the safe use of this repository," he said.
</p>
<p> Abraham also previewed the DOE's response to Nevada charges that nuclear waste shipments might be vulnerable to attack or accident.
</p>
<p> "This department has a 30-year-plus track record as they do in other countries as far as moving waste safely," he said. "In Europe they've moved as much waste in the same kind of form as we're talking about without incident."
</p>
<p> He added that transportation routes and shipment schedules wouldn't be publicized. Terrorists, he said, would have a clearer shot at waste kept in immobile on-site storage.
</p>
<p> "The fact is the waste is already closer to the people every day of the week than it will be if it moves past a community for five or ten minutes," he said. "We have a perfect track record."
</p>
<p> The American Nuclear Society, an organization of scientists and engineers devoted to peaceful applications of nuclear science, applauded Bush's endorsement of Yucca Mountain.
</p>
<p> "While this is just one step toward our ultimate goal of seeing the Department of Energy obtain a license for repository construction, it clears a major hurdle toward solving one of the most controversial issues involving nuclear energy," the society's president, Gail Marcus, said in a statement.
</p>
<p> Joe Colvin, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, whose members include utilities that would benefit from the repository, said Bush "honored his word."
</p>
<p> Wenonah Hauter, executive director of the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/" target="_new">Public Citizen Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program</a>, said activists allied with Nevada plan to campaign in key states.
</p>
<p> "What is next is a major organizing campaign around the country letting people know this deadly nuclear waste will be moving through their communities," she said.
</p>
<p> Kalynda Tilges, nuclear issues coordinator for <a href="http://www.citizenalert.org/index.html" target="_new">Citizen Alert</a>, a statewide environmental group, said Bush's decision showed "blatant disregard for the citizens of our country. The sheer hubris that has plagued this entire project is the type of thing that started the Boston Tea Party."
</p>
<p> Mayor Oscar Goodman, who has drawn attention on the Yucca Mountain issue with intemperate remarks about Abraham and former White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, said at an afternoon news conference that even though his "worst nightmare has been realized," the fight is not over.
</p>
<p> "We are going to do whatever is necessary to make sure Yucca Mountain does not become a reality," said Goodman, who was flanked by Councilmen Gary Reese and Lawrence Weekly and Clark County Commission Chairman Dario Herrera.
</p>
<p> That includes adding Bush's name to a federal lawsuit filed in January by the city of Las Vegas, Clark County and the state of Nevada seeking to block the project.
</p>
<p> Goodman said he didn't want to scare anyone, but then said that if high-level nuclear waste is transported from points across the country to Nevada, "It is just a matter of time, God forbid, that one of those cities (along the transportation routes) is destroyed."
</p>
<p> Herrera, seeking the Democratic nomination in Nevada's new 3rd Congressional District seat, painted the issue in more partisan terms, and noted a recent remark by House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas that the issue would be driven by "power politics," not sound science.
</p>
<p> In contrast to his previous remarks referring to Abraham as both a "fathead" and a "blockhead," Goodman said he would refrain from such language in describing President Bush "out of respect for the office."
