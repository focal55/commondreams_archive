<p>UNITED NATIONS &#150;&#150;  They heard plenty of promises from world leaders who vowed to improve their health, education and rights &#150; or simply provide them with food. But children attending the U.N. children's summit demanded one thing: action.<P>As the three-day meeting approached its end on Friday, children from around the world spoke out about AIDS and other diseases, the 120 million children who don't go to school, and governments that fail to respect children's rights.<P>"Most leaders just pay lip service to children," Bernice Akuamoah, a 15-year-old from Ghana, said during a rare dialogue between African leaders and African children. "They come and they say all these nice things and we expect them to happen, but that's a whole other matter."<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

The summit is bringing together about 3,000 delegates--including about 60 world leaders and over 250 children--along with 3,000 representatives of non-governmental organizations.

</table></font>Meanwhile, delegates from more than 180 countries were meeting behind closed doors, wrestling with a final summit document that is to set out new priorities and goals in efforts to improve the lot of children worldwide over the next 15 years.<P>The most serious divisions were over an effort to include a reference to the plight of Palestinian children and over language on family planning, children's rights, and "reproductive health" that some conservatives interpret as advocating abortion.<P>During the African discussion, Lipsy Ndwandwe, 17, of Swaziland, said children are united on what they want from their leaders. "We as children of Africa came together and agreed on things, but you leaders that we are supposed to look up to are not able to do that," she said.<P>Adam Maiga, a 15-year-old girl from Uganda, called for an end to "demagoguery," bluntly telling the presidents and prime ministers: "You have parliaments, but they are used as democratic decorations."<P>In the dialogues between children and leaders from Africa and other regions, protocol was not always respected: A teen-age moderator referred to Mauritania's prime minister as "the one from Mauritania," while Australia's minister for children was upgraded to "your majesty."<P>In a dialogue between Asian leaders and children, it was the turn of the heads of delegations to ask the questions.<P>The minister of women's affairs and social security of the Maldives, Rashida Yoosuf, asked the children what they considered child labor.<P>Rattana Lay, a teen-ager from Cambodia, immediately thought of prostitution. "It is the worst kind of child labor," she said.<P>When an official asked the children which wanted to enter politics when they grew up, Bah Subramanian, of India, raised his hand.<P>"We are working children and we don't want our children to become like us. We want to enter politics to stop that," the teen-ager said.<P>Negotiators met into the early hours on Friday, trying to wrap up the summit's final document.<P>A U.S. official said all the delegates have agreed privately that "health services" does not mean abortion, but the United States wants this specified in a footnote to the document. Diplomats said there was near-deadlock on the issue amid strong resistance to the U.S. demand.<P>A new controversy surfaced Thursday with over 20 Islamic and developing nations pressing for a specific reference to Palestinian children over objections from Israel and the United States. The draft document makes no mention of any specific group of children.<P>In the General Assembly, leaders of both the industrialized and developing world were urged to spend more money on children and less on weapons.<P>"When there is a war against any nation, the state finds the money. This is a war for our children. We want the money and we are going to get it for them," said Najma Heptullah, deputy head of India's upper house of parliament.<P>Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo pledged to spend less on defense and more on children. "My government has reduced the military expenditures and will use that money to bolster social spending, particularly in the defense and education of children," he told the General Assembly.<P>Norway's Minister for International Development Hilde Johnsson said there was reason to be optimistic. "The tide is there. The countries that are not increasing aid feel a bit awkward and feel they should deliver more," she said. "That is very good pressure that has been built."
