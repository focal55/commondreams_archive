With the U.S. air campaign in Afghanistan largely complete and the 
security situation across the country generally improving, the 
Pentagon is facing closer scrutiny about the extent of civilian 
casualties reported since American bombs started falling in October.

<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights Watch</a>, a privately funded human-rights advocacy group, 
plans to send a team of researchers to Afghanistan next month to try 
to estimate the number of civilians killed during the course of the 
campaign. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> may do the same after trying 
unsuccessfully to get the Pentagon to disclose details about a number 
of bombings that reportedly killed civilians. And a University of New 
Hampshire professor has made headlines -- and drawn sharp criticism 
-- by publishing a database he says details thousands of civilian 
casualties caused by the air war.

<p>The efforts come in the wake of an investigation opened by U.S. 
commanders into a raid last month that Pentagon officials now 
acknowledge may have resulted in the death of forces friendly to the 
U.S.-backed interim government of Hamid Karzai. In the raid, American 
soldiers killed as many as 18 people in two compounds they believed 
were al Qaeda leadership posts in the village of Hazar Qadam. A 
spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, responsible for operations in 
Afghanistan, said the investigation isn't complete, but more than two 
dozen people U.S. troops seized in the raid were turned over 
Wednesday to Mr. Karzai's government after it was determined they 
aren't Taliban or al Qaeda fighters.

<p>That incident followed a December air strike on a convoy near Khost 
that local Afghans -- and Mr. Karzai -- say killed tribal elders 
loyal to the new government, not Taliban leaders as the Pentagon 
originally claimed. Central Command is still looking into that 
incident. But so far, investigators believe they hit "exactly" what 
they intended to hit, the Central Command spokesman said.

<p>The investigations, spurred by outrage from U.S.-backed Afghan 
factions, have done little to quiet criticism from human-rights 
activists. "While they are undertaking investigations in a number of 
cases, we would hope they would investigate every instance of alleged 
civilian casualties," said Margaret Ladner, a London-based researcher 
who is part of an Amnesty International team looking at alleged 
human-rights violations in Afghanistan. "And we would hope that they 
would make those investigations public."

<p>Defense officials have acknowledged repeatedly that civilians may 
have died as a result of U.S. bombing. "There is no question that we 
have killed and injured people we did not intend to in the course of 
the war," said Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, the top spokesman for 
Central Command, based in Tampa, Fla. But military planners have gone 
to great lengths to "maximize damage [to Taliban and al Qaeda 
targets] and minimize civilian casualties and collateral damage" 
during military operations in Afghanistan, Adm. Quigley said.

<p>The Pentagon also has pointed periodically to the more than 3,000 
civilians killed in the Sept. 11 attacks, which triggered the air 
campaign. The U.S. blames Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist 
network, which enjoyed refuge under Afghanistan's Taliban regime.

<p>Except for a handful of cases, however, the Pentagon has avoided 
addressing specific instances of alleged civilian casualties. A small 
damage-assessment team at Central Command looks into cases where 
credible evidence points to civilian casualties, double-checking 
targeting data and reviewing aerial photography and other 
intelligence, officials say. With few American troops on the ground 
throughout most of the bombing campaign, officials have said it was 
impossible to investigate thoroughly most reports of civilian deaths. 
Now, with thousands of U.S. troops moving more freely across 
Afghanistan, the Pentagon says it is too late to begin 
investigations. "If you can't get there real quick, there's not much 
you are going to learn that you have any confidence in," Adm. Quigley 
said.

<p>Human Rights Watch disagrees. A team of three researchers plans to 
enter Afghanistan early next month to survey sites where civilian 
casualties may have occurred. The team has compiled a database of 
more than 330 alleged incidents across the country. About a third of 
those allegations are considered credible, according to William M. 
Arkin, who will lead the Afghanistan team.

<p>Human Rights Watch is keeping a preliminary tally based on news 
reports, Pentagon briefings and reports from the group's members in 
Pakistan. Group officials privately had estimated the civilian death 
toll at between 100 and 350 early in December, but they won't comment 
on what they now believe the number may be.

<p>One researcher already is saying the civilian death toll from the 
U.S. campaign in Afghanistan may be in the thousands. Marc W. Herold, 
a professor of economics and women's studies at the University of New 
Hampshire, has compiled a database from local and international news 
reports indicating between 3,300 and 3,900 civilians died during the 
Afghanistan campaign. While his study has attracted news-media 
attention, human-rights groups have said it is flawed because it 
relies on second- and third-hand reporting. Mr. Herold defended his 
methodology, however, saying he has spent considerable time sorting 
out conflicting reports and taking into account the biases of many of 
his sources.
