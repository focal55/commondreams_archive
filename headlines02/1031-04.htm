<p> Despite the deaths of 119 hostages, Russia's success on Saturday in saving 
hundreds of others using a knockout gas against their bomb-toting captors in a 
Moscow theater is likely to boost efforts to develop similar "nonlethal" weaponry. 
<P>That's bad news to chemical arms control advocates, who fear the unraveling 
of 80 years of treaties that stemmed from worldwide revulsion at the use of poison 
gases in the trenches of Europe during World War I. 
<P>"There are very good reasons why chemical weapons were prohibited," said Edward 
Hammond, of the <a href="http://www.sunshine-project.org/" target="_new">Sunshine 
Project</a>, an Austin, Texas, group that has unearthed public documents about 
U.S. efforts to make such weapons. "The great fear is that this incident in Moscow 
will send us down a slippery slope. . . . It is very worrying to us that governments 
around the world are not condemning it." 
<P>Hammond said distinctions between lethal and nonlethal chemical weapons tended 
to blur quickly in a crisis. In the Moscow theater, the gas was clearly deadly 
to hostages and captors alike. Once the cap on chemical weapons use is lifted, 
Hammond fears, the full range of horrors made possible by modern chemistry becomes 
possible. 
<P>After days of international pressure, Moscow acknowledged Wednesday that the 
active ingredient in the incapacitating agent pumped into the theater was a form 
of fentanyl, a synthetic drug similar to morphine, but about about 80 times more 
potent. 
<P>In all likelihood, the Russian gas is an artifact of the Cold War. 
<P>"Both the United States and the former Soviet Union did a lot of research on 
incapacitants, including some related to morphine," said Eric Croddy, senior researcher 
at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. 
<P>But experts said fentanyl proved difficult to aerosolize and even harder to 
control safely, so it is unlikely Americans have stores of it, even in the nation's 
most secret warehouses. Use of such an agent in warfare is also strictly prohibited 
by treaties such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by the United States 
in 1997. 
<P>Proponents of the use of nonlethal weapons said rigid interpretation of those 
treaties prevented development of more humane weapons. 
<P>"People had been working on these things into the mid-1970s, then it became 
politically incorrect," said John Alexander, a retired colonel and author of "Future 
Wars," a book about nonlethal weaponry. "It's a real paradox. 
<P>The treaties were designed to prevent large-scale casualties and fatalities. 
But these are life-conserving technologies that are possible." 
<P>Alexander said that "the net has been cast too broadly" and that such treaties 
"need to be revisited." 
<P>Regardless, the United States has been conducting research on a range of incapacitating 
weapons for possible use in terrorist attacks or civil disturbances. Hammond maintains 
such work violates international law, and he accuses U.S. institutions of withholding 
public information about it. 
<P>Hammond has used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain documents detailing 
significant research in nonlethal weaponry. That research, described in nonclassified 
documents, discloses the development of a chemical-bearing mortar shell that can 
carry incapacitating gases a mile and a half from the firing point, and of microscopic 
capsules to carry and disperse nonlethal chemicals. 
<P>The Sunshine Project has been attempting since March to pry from the National 
Academy of Sciences a series of reports written in 1994 by Army chemical weapons 
experts on the use of "calmative agents," military argot for incapacitating agents. 
<P>"NAS has critical information for understanding the chemical agents used in 
Moscow, but it is refusing to release it because it wants to avoid embarrassing 
the Pentagon, which denies that this type of research exists in the United States," 
Hammond said in a press release. 
<P>Academy spokesman Bill Skane replied that the documents had been cleared as 
nonclassified but cannot be released without final clearance from the Department 
of Defense. The final sticking point has to do with concerns that the documents 
contain information that would be barred from disclosure abroad under export control 
rules governing the transfer of technology from one country to another. 
<P>"We're in the midst of a very long-lasting process," Skane said. 
<P>Although the law requires the academy to disclose nonclassified material, it 
cannot do so without the export control clearance. "We are caught between two 
responsibilities," Skane said. </p>
