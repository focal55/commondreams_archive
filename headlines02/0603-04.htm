<p>For a man under investigation for attempted murder on the high seas, Paul Watson seems remarkably calm. The veteran environmentalist, who has been arrested many times before but never convicted, believes the latest accusation is an example of how far powerful fishing interests are prepared to go in trying to neutralize conservation campaigners. 
<P>Mr Watson is the founder of <a href="http://www.seashepherd.org/" target="_new">Sea Shepherd</a>, the conservation group based in Malibu, California, whose two ships patrol the seas challenging illegal fishing and whaling.  
<P>Recently, Sea Shepherd was asked by a number of Latin American governments to act on their behalf in protecting endangered marine species from poachers. Last month, it was invited by a Costa Rican environmental group and the Costa Rican government to assist in the protection of Cocos island, 320 miles off the coast.  
<P>On the way to the island last month on Sea Shepherd's vessel, the Farley Mowat, group members came across a Costa Rican ship poaching. They contacted the authorities who told them to bring it in. As the poachers attempted to escape, Mr Watson used water hoses "to intimidate them" after which, he said, the two boats collided, doing some damage to the poachers '13 vessel.  
<P>But when the Farley Mowat reached port in Costa Rica, Mr Watson was told by a judge and prosecutor that he was alleged to have rammed the other ship and tried to kill its captain. He was told he would be charged with attempted murder and destruction of property.  
<P>"I said, 'first of all, if I had rammed him once, he would be sunk and if it was my intent to kill him, he'd be dead'," said Mr Watson, now back in Malibu.  
<P>By chance a documentary team was on board his ship and had filmed the episode. When the video was shown to   the prosecutor, the charges were dismissed. But a few days later, a new prosecutor - appointed under pressure, Mr Watson believes, from the fishing industry - made it clear that he should be held in jail pending charges. On the advice of his Costa Rican lawyer, Mr Watson returned to the US.  
<P>"It is like the new Spider-Man film," he said. "The hero is rescuing babies from burning fires and fighting crime but a newspaper reporter charges him with assault. Here we are trying to assist and they're coming for us."  
<P>He said that after the collision his vessel had had to "run the gauntlet" of hostile fishing vessels including many from Taiwan. "It's out of control down there. Taiwan gives a lot of foreign aid to Costa Rica so it looks like they are basically buying the right to fish even though it's not legal."  
<P>Mr Watson believes fishing interests wanted him and his ship out of action. "My lawyer is pretty confident that there is lot of funny business going on," he said. "I am not going back to Costa Rica unless they drop the investigation or they charge me."  
<P>The Farley Mowat, with a 21-strong international crew, is now setting off on a separate mission for the Galapagos islands, attempting to intercept another poaching vessel.  
<P>Although his opponents have accused Mr Watson of being a terrorist and a pirate because of the aggressive action he takes against poaching vessels, he has also been asked by the governments of Colombia and Ecuador to assist them in stopping poachers.  
<P>But while those governments are happy when he acts   against nationals of other countries who break the law, he said, they were less than happy when he acted against their own nationals.  
<P>"In Ecuador, if I go after an Ecuadoran, I'm in trouble, if I go after a Costa Rican, I'm a hero. There is a lot of corruption... If we can't save Cocos and the Galapagos which are not only national parks but   world heritage sites, how are we going to save anything else?"  
<P>He uses as his basis for action against poachers the United Nations world charter for nature which says that any body or individual has the authority to intervene to uphold international conservation regulations.  
<P>He was arrested by Canadian    authorities in 1993 for chasing Cuban and Spanish trawlers off Newfoundland. "I was charged with three counts of mischief, two of which carried a sentence of life imprisonment so it was two times life plus 10 for saving fish," said Mr Watson. "I never injured anybody or damaged property but they said I cost $35m in lost revenue. My defense was the UN world   charter for nature." He was acquitted after a four-week, $4m trial.  
<P>"We say things that people don't want to hear and do things people don't want to see but I don't see any other way of tackling these problems," said Mr Watson.  
<P>"We've got to be outspoken and interventionist. We know we'll get into trouble for it and we're certainly not whining about that." One of the founders of Greenpeace, Mr Watson has since fallen out with the group which he describes as "the world's biggest feel-good organization".  
<P>Sea Shepherd is funded by a loyal membership of 35,000 and includes among its supporters many in the entertainment business, such as Pierce Brosnan, Martin Sheen and Rutger Hauer.  
<P>Two films about Mr Watson and Sea Shepherd are now under way. Producer Pieter Kroonenberg says shooting of Ocean Warrior will start in September. It will be an action adventure story based on Mr Watson as a young man.</p>
