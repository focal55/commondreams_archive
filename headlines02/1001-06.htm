<p>WASHINGTON &#150;&#150; Iraq's bioweapons program that President Bush wants 
to eradicate got its start with help from Uncle Sam two decades ago, according 
to government records getting new scrutiny in light of the discussion of war against 
Iraq. 
<P>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent samples directly to several 
Iraqi sites that U.N. weapons inspectors determined were part of Saddam Hussein's 
biological weapons program, CDC and congressional records from the early 1990s 
show. Iraq had ordered the samples, claiming it needed them for legitimate medical 
research. 
<P>The CDC and a biological sample company, the American Type Culture Collection, 
sent strains of all the germs Iraq used to make weapons, including anthrax, the 
bacteria that make botulinum toxin and the germs that cause gas gangrene, the 
records show. Iraq also got samples of other deadly pathogens, including the West 
Nile virus. 
<P>The transfers came in the 1980s, when the United States supported Iraq in its 
war against Iran. They were detailed in a 1994 Senate Banking Committee report 
and a 1995 follow-up letter from the CDC to the Senate. 
<P>The exports were legal at the time and approved under a program administered 
by the Commerce Department. 
<P>"I don't think it would be accurate to say the United States government deliberately 
provided seed stocks to the Iraqis' biological weapons programs," said Jonathan 
Tucker, a former U.N. biological weapons inspector. 
<P>"But they did deliver samples that Iraq said had a legitimate public health 
purpose, which I think was naive to believe, even at the time." 
<P>The disclosures put the United States in the uncomfortable position of possibly 
having provided the key ingredients of the weapons America is considering waging 
war to destroy, said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. Byrd entered the documents into 
the Congressional Record this month. 
<P>Byrd asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld about the germ transfers at 
a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Byrd noted that Rumsfeld met 
Saddam in 1983, when Rumsfeld was President Reagan's Middle East envoy. 
<P>"Are we, in fact, now facing the possibility of reaping what we have sown?" 
Byrd asked Rumsfeld after reading parts of a Newsweek article on the transfers. 
<P>"I have never heard anything like what you've read, I have no knowledge of 
it whatsoever, and I doubt it," Rumsfeld said. He later said he would ask the 
Defense Department and other government agencies to search their records for evidence 
of the transfers. 
<P>Invoices included in the documents read like shopping lists for biological 
weapons programs. One 1986 shipment from the Virginia-based American Type Culture 
Collection included three strains of anthrax, six strains of the bacteria that 
make botulinum toxin and three strains of the bacteria that cause gas gangrene. 
Iraq later admitted to the United Nations that it had made weapons out of all 
three. 
<P>The company sent the bacteria to the University of Baghdad, which U.N. inspectors 
concluded had been used as a front to acquire samples for Iraq's biological weapons 
program. 
<P>The CDC, meanwhile, sent shipments of germs to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission 
and other agencies involved in Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. It 
sent samples in 1986 of botulinum toxin and botulinum toxoid &#150; used to make 
vaccines against botulinum toxin &#150; directly to the Iraqi chemical and biological 
weapons complex at al-Muthanna, the records show. 
<P>Botulinum toxin is the paralyzing poison that causes botulism. Having a vaccine 
to the toxin would be useful for anyone working with it, such as biological weapons 
researchers or soldiers who might be exposed to the deadly poison, Tucker said. 
<P>The CDC also sent samsamples of a strain of West Nile virus to an Iraqi microbiologist 
at a university in the southern city of Basra in 1985, the records show. 
<P>The documents are available at: <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_cr/s092002.html">http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_cr/s092002.html</a>
