<p>The city of Burlington, Vt., is challenging residents to reduce their household 
releases of carbon dioxide gas by 10 percent. Brookline officials are mulling 
an ordinance to require homeowners to plant new trees to absorb carbon dioxide 
whenever they cut down a significant number. The Boston Public Health Commission 
just bought five hybrid cars to reduce carbon dioxide and other pollutants. 
<P> In the last two years, more than 40 municipal and grass-roots groups - from 
citizen organizations to religious coalitions - have formed across New England 
to accomplish locally what they say the Bush administration has failed to do nationally: 
Slow global warming. 
<P> Underscoring the burgeoning effort, clergy led interfaith prayer sessions 
to end global warming at all six New England State Houses last month. 
<P> The activists know their efforts to limit greenhouse gases amount to tiny 
gestures against the vast scale of the problem, which largely comes from the worldwide 
burning of coal, gas, and oil. But just as towns declared themselves nuclear weapons-free 
zones in the 1980s, local climate-change activists say they are laying a foundation 
for political action that could one day build up to national policy. 
<P> ''I know it's mostly symbolic, but there is a chance here for the people to 
change [federal policy],'' said Erik Hoffner, of Shutesbury, a town of 1,800 near 
Amherst that is developing its own climate-change action plan. Town Meeting this 
spring overwhelmingly approved a resolution he submitted to conduct a town inventory 
of greenhouse gas emissions and eventually reduce them. 
<P> ''We have one tiny Town Hall, one municipal Highway Department with a couple 
of snowplows. But everyone in our town gets in their cars and drives to Amherst 
everyday. We can educate people about how they are contributing ... and maybe 
they will lighten their footprints.'' 
<P> If awards were given for the most difficult grass-roots environmental campaign, 
global warming would probably win. Unlike with land preservation or pesticides, 
people have a difficult time seeing a direct link between their lives and the 
slow warming of the earth - the average temperature has increased by 1 degree 
Fahrenheit in the last century. As fossil fuels are burned in power plants and 
cars, they release carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere 
by the thousands of tons. These gases hover over the earth, trapping rising heat 
and radiating it back down again like glass in a greenhouse. 
<P> But carbon dioxide, the main culprit in global warming, isn't some nasty chemical: 
it's the fourth most abundant gas on earth. Animals and humans exhale it and it 
has dozens of uses, including carbonation of soda and beer. For years, activists 
have complained that it is hard to sustain the public's attention on such a common 
and slow-acting threat - especially with federal policy makers consistently dismissing 
the concept of global warming. A new federal report now acknowledges the phenomenon, 
but the Bush administration has distanced itself from the document. Indeed, President 
Bush has rejected the international global warming treaty negotiated under his 
predecessor Bill Clinton. 
<P> New England had done the opposite. Tufts University in Medford has a climate 
change initiative, an institutional commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
A coalition of regional governors and Canadian premiers agreed last August to 
roll back greenhouse gas emissions in the Northeast to 1990 levels by 2010. More 
than 20 communities in the region - often with the prodding of groups like the 
Massachusetts Climate Action Network or Clean Air-Cool Planet in New Hampshire 
- have become part of Cities for Climate Protection, a program of the International 
Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. 
<P> To belong, each community must add up their total greenhouse gas emissions 
- and come up with a detailed local action plan to reduce them. For instance, 
Medford just replaced all its traffic signals with displays that use less energy. 
Arlington residents just passed a bylaw to have town officials buy the most fuel-efficient 
cars they can. Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino has pledged to cut city energy consumption 
by 10 percent by 2005. 
<P> Brookline even figured out how much greenhouse gas each person will produce 
by 2010 - 12.56 tons a year. In 1995, it was 11.78. 
<P> ''It's such a nebulous issue, the way to effect any change is to get people 
to see how their own individual energy consumption, or transportation habits connect 
to this problem,'' said Briony Angus, climate change project manager in Brookline. 
In Boston, officials purposely worked on global climate through the Public Health 
Department to ensure people saw a personal link. 
<P> Activists say they can only do so much, however. For example, while Cambridge 
is committed to purchasing 20 percent of its electricity from so-called green 
power sources by 2010, the sources may not be around. The city also said it would 
increase fuel economy in cars. 
<P> ''Of course, we can't do that without help,'' said Susanne Rasmussen, director 
of environmental and transportation planning for Cambridge. ''But [these goals] 
make it easier to demand the federal government take action. A lot of initiatives 
had to be demonstrated on the local level before they went [national].'' 
<P> Still, it can be confusing to sort out the motives for some of these actions, 
since many of them also fight smog and asthma in addition to global warming. As 
local communities latch on to the global warming cause, everything is being lumped 
under its banner. Buying bikes for police officers, replacing streetlights with 
more energy efficient ones - even stopping buses from idling in Roxbury and Dorchester 
- are now part of global warming campaigns. 
<P> ''What we're doing is building momentum,'' said the Rev. Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, 
associate rector of All Saints Parish in Brookline and cochair of a local chapter 
of Religious Witness for the Earth. The group led the prayer sessions at New England 
state houses. 
<P> ''With global warming, the first stage is denial and then once we get past 
that and realize this is real, people get overwhelmed. But there are things we 
can do,'' she said.
