<p>Documents obtained by the Review-Journal indicate that Yucca Mountain Project 
workers registered deep concerns about shortcomings in the process that scientists 
used to find the site suitable for disposing the nation's highly radioactive waste. 
</p>
<p> Documents and interviews with project workers reveal that deficiencies in 
computer modeling, software and data afflicted the project as workers raced to 
meet looming deadlines. </p>
<p> The project's director of quality assurance, Robert Clark, urged that corrective 
measures be taken. Clark confirmed he was then transferred and told to "take one 
for the project." </p>
<p> In addition, one of the workers who had conveyed concerns about the project 
to the Department of Energy was fired by the DOE's quality assurance contractor, 
Navarro Research and Engineering. </p>

</font>A Labor Department investigator later determined that part of the reason 
Navarro fired its quality assurance manager, Jim Mattimoe, was it had been urged 
to do so by Lake Barrett, a top DOE official. The inspector deemed Barrett's actions 
"extraordinarily egregious." </p>
<p> In a June 24 memo to Labor Department investigator Nicholas Sebastian, Navarro 
employee Kristi Hodges addressed the treatment of Clark and Mattimoe, manager 
of a staff that audited the project's science and engineering. </p>
<p> "If one connects the dots, the overall theme supports that they were removed 
because the quality assurance organization was too effective in identifying and 
pursuing significant deficiencies that were perceived as threatening the Yucca 
Mountain site recommendation," Hodges wrote. </p>
<p> "As the project schedule became increasingly compressed, cutting corners to 
meeting project milestones resulted in slippage of corrective action deadlines 
and creation of new deficiencies," Hodges wrote. </p>
<p> The memo was generated during a Labor Department probe into Mattimoe's claim 
that he was fired because he blew the whistle on the way project officials investigated 
workers' concerns. </p>

<font size="2" color="#000000"><BR>
The following are highlights of the Labor Department case of former Yucca Mountain 
Project contractor employee Jim Mattimoe: <BR>
<B>July 1999:</B> Mattimoe, with 28 years experience in quality assurance programs, 
becomes manager for the program with SAIC, a Yucca Mountain Project contractor. 
<BR>
<BR>
<B>March 2001:</B> Mattimoe makes claims of wrongdoing in the project's concerns 
program to Robert Clark, director of quality assurance for the Office of Civilian 
Radioactive Waste Management. <BR>
<BR>
<B>April 2001:</B> Clark informs Lake Barrett, acting director of the Office of 
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, of Mattimoe's concerns. Barrett orders 
Clark to direct Mattimoe to turn over evidence of wrongdoing in the project's 
concerns program. <BR>
<BR>
<B>May 2001:</B> Mattimoe becomes quality assurance program manager for Navarro 
Research and Engineering. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Aug. 6, 2001:</B> Mattimoe is placed on administrative leave and banned from 
the project's offices. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Aug. 24, 2001:</B> Navarro Research and Engineering terminates Mattimoe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Aug. 27, 2001:</B> The Department of Energy through a subcontractor settles 
with quality assurance employee David Mitchell for an undisclosed sum, thus avoiding 
having corruption allegations heard before an administrative judge. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sept. 5, 2001:</B> Clark is transferred from director of quality assurance 
for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to a special assignment. 
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Feb. 20:</B> Mattimoe files a wrongful termination complaint with the Labor 
Department. <BR>
<BR>
<B>March 14:</B> Barrett confirms he will retire as acting director of the Office 
of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, after holding that position for 14 months 
in his third stint as acting director. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sept. 13:</B> Labor Department Regional Administrator Frank Strasheim issues 
a report directing Navarro Research and Engineering to reinstate Mattimoe, clear 
his record and reimburse his expenses. Susana Navarro, president of the firm, 
appeals the decision a short time later. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Nov. 18:</B> Mattimoe gives a deposition for Navarro Research and Engineering's 
appeal of the Labor Department report. <br>

In a Sept. 13 report, the Labor Department ordered Navarro to reinstate Mattimoe, 
expunge his personnel file and reimburse him for costs incurred. </p>
<p> The report states that Susana Navarro, president of Navarro Research and Engineering, 
was motivated to fire Mattimoe "at least in part to her fear that she might not 
receive future extensions or contracts with DOE unless she took this action." 
</p>
<p> But Navarro is appealing the Labor Department ruling and Mattimoe, who's since 
been working at the Los Alamos, N.M., national laboratory, was summoned to Las 
Vegas last week for a deposition. </p>
<p> In an e-mail Thursday, Susana Navarro said an audit by a prominent law firm 
found "among other things, that Mr. Mattimoe's conduct as a program manager for 
SAIC (the previous contractor) was inconsistent with a safety conscious work environment." 
</p>
<p> "I based my decision on the findings of this report, and I really believe 
that I did the right thing," she wrote. </p>
<p> The Labor Department report, however, says the law firm's audit "is not more 
than a sophisticated recitation of anonymous charges." </p>
<p> After more than 20 years of political wrangling and scientific study, the 
DOE earlier this year recommended that more than 77,000 tons of the nation's deadliest 
nuclear waste be buried at Yucca Mountain, located 100 miles northwest of Las 
Vegas. </p>
<p> President Bush adopted the recommendation, and Congress approved it over the 
veto of Gov. Kenny Guinn. The first shipment of nuclear waste could arrive in 
2010. </p>
<p> Shortly before DOE issued its recommendation, the presidentially appointed 
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board concluded that the "technical basis for DOE's 
repository performance estimate is weak to moderate." </p>
<p> Specifically, the board was concerned about studies of the way groundwater 
travels through the ridge, and how thermal conditions from the decaying nuclear 
fuel will affect the mountain. </p>
<p> DOE officials have defended the science on which the recommendation was based. 
But documents show that project employees also were concerned about flaws in the 
process. </p>
<p> A key concern mentioned in Hodges' memo was validation of computer models 
vital to federal scientists' assertions that nuclear waste can safely be contained 
in Yucca Mountain for 10,000 years. </p>
<p> "To conduct the Yucca Mountain Project modeling effort with any credibility, 
a consistent approach was needed. At the time of the (corrective action reports), 
there was no consistent approach, no governing procedures, and insufficient governing 
regulations," she wrote.</p>
<p> Mattimoe, 52, said he was fired after he made allegations of wrongdoing and 
corruption to Barrett. At the time, Barrett was in charge of DOE's Office of Civilian 
Radioactive Waste Management, which oversaw the Yucca Mountain Project. </p>
<p> In interviews this week, Mattimoe said the allegations involved the manner 
of investigating concerns that government workers, contract employees and others 
raised about the project. </p>
<p> According to Hodges' memo, some of the concerns pertained to the "monumental 
task" of integrating two decades of scientific data with hundreds of computer 
software codes used by national laboratories, universities and government contractors. 
</p>
<p> Others involved the defensibility of the "technical products," the models 
and analyses on which the scientists' conclusions hinge. The DOE must show regulators 
evidence that data about the planned repository were collected by qualified personnel 
using appropriate equipment. </p>
<p> Examples of wrongdoing, Mattimoe said, included withholding evidence and attributing 
statements to people who had never been interviewed about concerns with the project. 
</p>
<p> "The concerns program, which is much like an internal affairs division in 
a police department, is chartered to perform unbiased, independent investigations 
into any type of concern that could impact the safety of the project and the public," 
he said. </p>
<p> "I identified that the concerns program was corrupt and thereby raised questions 
about the credibility of all investigations for a period of nearly 10 years," 
Mattimoe said. </p>
<p> The Labor Department's report states that Barrett "failed to avail himself" 
to Sebastian, the investigator, during the seven-month investigation until after 
his findings had been turned in to the Labor Department's regional administrator. 
</p>
<p> Barrett, who is retired and residing in Rockville, Md., said he tried to make 
himself available to Sebastian. "When he called I was away on family business," 
he said last week. </p>
<p> In her memo, Hodges said Clark, the government's quality assurance manager, 
was transferred to another assignment even though "he had a vision that the science 
and engineering could be defensible and accomplished with integrity." </p>
<p> "When removed from his position, Mr. Barrett told him to `take one for the 
project' ... as the deficiencies were reaching too wide of an audience, including 
the public, and were increasingly reflecting poorly on project management." </p>
<p> Barrett declined to comment on Mattimoe's case and Clark's transfer other 
than to say, "I'm personally satisfied with the actions that I took." </p>
<p> Both Mattimoe and Clark believe their removal from the project was related 
to allegations raised by a Colorado-based subcontractor employee, David Mitchell. 
</p>
<p> DOE documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that 
Mitchell told DOE officials the project's quality assurance program was deeply 
flawed. </p>
<p> According to the DOE documents, Mitchell alleged that, "This program is corrupt 
to the point that it may impact licensing application or the entire project. Corruption 
to this extent may be considered to fall into the `whistle-blowers' act." </p>
<p> A Labor Department report states that Mitchell was fired for "exhibiting hostile 
behavior towards a supervisor." He filed a complaint claiming he was wrongfully 
terminated for other reasons. </p>
<p> A Labor Department investigator found no merit to his case and recommended 
it be dismissed. </p>
<p> But rather than submit to a hearing at which his allegations would have been 
aired, the DOE subcontractor reached an out-of-court settlement with Mitchell. 
DOE agreed to reimburse the subcontractor for the settlement. Department officials 
refused to say how much money was paid Mitchell in the Aug. 27, 2001, settlement. 
</p>
<p> Prior to the settlement, Mattimoe and Clark had been investigating the allegations 
raised by Mitchell. </p>
<p> Mattimoe was fired three days before the settlement was reached. Clark was 
transferred less than two weeks after the settlement. </p>
<p> Clark said he was puzzled when he found out the matter was settled out of 
court. "I was shocked and amazed," he said in an interview last week. </p>
<p> Clark said he believes he and Mattimoe were targeted for termination or demotion 
as part of the settlement.</P>
