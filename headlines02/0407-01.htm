TEL AVIV--
More than 20,000 Jews and Israeli Arabs marched together here last 
night demanding that the government withdraw from the West Bank and 
immediately resume peace talks with the Palestinians.
<P>"There is a black flag waving over this war. We must get out of the 
territories and return to the 1967 borders. (Prime Minister Ariel) Sharon 
wants to take us back to the 1967 war," said Zahava Gal-On, a lawmaker from 
the leftist Meretz party whose speech was greeted with wide applause and 
cheering.
<P>

</font>Hundreds of Israeli Arabs came out in force for the first time in many 
months, marching alongside Jewish Israelis and chanting, "Yalla, yalla, Sharon 
get out of Ramallah." Yalla means "come" in both Hebrew and Arabic.
<P>"I think it was after the (suicide) bomb in Haifa last week, in which so 
many Arabs died, too, that made people from Sakhnin want to come out tonight 
and demonstrate," said Maher Tawsiq, an Arab Israeli from northern Israel, 
shouting to make himself heard over the noise of the demonstration.
<P>Although the numbers did not match the crowds that the peace movement once 
commanded, the march from Rabin Square, in the center of the city, to the 
defense ministry a mile away provided a boost to Israelis on the left.
<P>"It's very important to come out now and show our opposition. I really 
think the anti-Sharon movement is growing," said Ruth Zwecker, a Tel Aviv 
mother of three who has come to every rally since the Palestinian intifada, or 
uprising, began 18 months ago. "The fact that I see my neighbor here who does 
not usually come to these rallies is a very good sign. It shows that people 
who have been apathetic are starting to wake up."
<P>After months of inertia, the Israeli left started to revive a few weeks ago,
<P>just as Palestinian suicide bombers began a wave of deadly attacks inside 
Israel. That makes it harder for Israelis on the left, the staunchest 
supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict, to get their message 
across.
<P>But some demonstrators said last night that they were propelled to come 
precisely because of the violence. The rally was a chance for Israelis who are 
opposed to Sharon, and his belief in a military solution to the conflict, to 
try to change the situation.
<P>"What's going on in the West Bank is absolutely terrible, and I'm utterly 
opposed to it. So the very least we can do is demonstrate against it," said 
Paula Kelman, a Jerusalem filmmaker.
<P>The main organizer of last night's rally was Peace Now, Israel's largest 
movement committed to withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza. Peace Now 
stepped up activities to end the occupation more than two months ago, 
maintaining a 12-hour-a-day vigil outside Sharon's office and staging weekly 
demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
<P>Peace Now is entering a new phase leading up to a mass rally in Rabin 
Square on May 11, organizers said.
<P>"Between these events, there will be many local and national activities, 
which will all call on the Sharon government to present a political path which 
offers a way out of the current crisis. The government of Israel should 
respond to the Saudi initiative positively and as an historic breakthrough in 
Israel's relationship to the Arab world," said Moria Shlomot, director of 
Peace Now.
<P>The Saudi Arabian plan, since endorsed by the Arab League, calls on 
neighboring Arab countries to grant Israel full recognition in exchange for 
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights.
<P>"We'll work to influence the Israeli public toward accepting these 
positions and working toward the establishment of a government which advances 
them. But if the government does not offer such an alternative, we intend to 
create massive street presence in opposition," Shlomot said.
<P>Also present at last night's rally were the Kibbutz movement, several youth 
organizations, the Forum of Bereaved Parents and the Democratic Choice party.
<P>Other groups are still active in the search for peace.
<P>The Coalition of Peace Movements organized a rally at an Israeli army 
checkpoint Wednesday in which 3,000 people -- both Jews and Arabs -- protested.
<P>They also organized trucks of food and medical supplies for Palestinians in 
the besieged West Bank city of Ramallah, and they managed to get across the 
checkpoint where the rally was held.
<P>The Jewish-Arab Center for Peace at Givat Haviva, in Galilee, has worked 
for 40 years as a place of dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis.
<P>"Our very existence as the center promoting cooperation and joint work 
between Palestinians and Israelis is a living proof that an alternative way 
can be achieved," said its press director, Mohammad Darawshe. "Even in the 
midst of these crazy days, we are trying to conduct a sane discussion, to keep 
ties between Israelis and Palestinians alive and to continue to strive for 
alternatives to the current situation."
<P>Other Israeli organizations working with Palestinians include the 
Association for Civil Rights in Israel; B'Tselem, Israel's largest human 
rights group; HaMoked (the Center for the Defense of the Individual); and 
Physicians for Human Rights.
<P>Despite the turnout at last night's rally and the commitment of the 
activists, it is clear that this is not yet a mass movement. During the 
Lebanon War two decades ago, 400,000 people -- a tenth of the country's 
population at the time -- rallied in Tel Aviv's downtown square. That kind of 
protest movement has not been kindled.
