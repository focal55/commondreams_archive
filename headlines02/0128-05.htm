HOUSTON -- Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampant, divorce among senior executives an epidemic, and stories of couples steaming up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houston.
<p class="story">"It was insane," says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injuries with a margarita.</p>
<p class="story">"There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge - sex, money, all of it."</p>
<p class="story">But the music has suddenly stopped. Savings and pensions have been wiped out, careers destroyed and America's version of free-market capitalism dragged into the interrogation room.</p>
<p class="story">The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington, where the political witch-hunt is gaining pace, and on Wall Street, but nowhere more so than in Houston, the stage for Enron's gaudy act.</p>
<p class="story">From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two energy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left by the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had been ended by the collapse in oil prices.</p>
<p class="story">In River Oaks, the smartest suburb of Houston, home to the likes of the former president, George Bush, Enron executives began building huge mansions.</p>
<p class="story">Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron under the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated his house all black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.</p>
<p class="story">The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed sweaters and leather trousers.</p>
<p class="story">But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks.</p>
<p class="story">He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business school graduates, from places such as Harvard and Stanford, to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="story">He did so by creating the same culture of unself-conscious greed and reward which Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of the late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of The Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth.</p>
<p class="story">Managers employed a system known as "rank or yank". Every employee's performance was ranked 1-5. Five meant you were out. The bottom 15 per cent of workers were fired each year.</p>
<p class="story">For the best workers the incentives were staggering. Bonus day was known at the company as Car Day, because of the lines of extraordinary sports cars arriving for the most successful employees.</p>
<p class="story">To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.</p>
<p class="story">While the accountants came up with schemes for Enron to credit itself with vast and phoney profits to look good on Wall Street, the traders and consultants, often new to Texas, found themselves immersed in the Enron culture.</p>
<p class="story">Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They knew it was a house of cards and began pulling out as much money as they could.</p>
<p class="story">The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out while those further down believed the hype.</p>
<p class="story">"We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a web designer who lost his &pound;39,000-a-year job and is now struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."</p>
<p class="story"> </p>
<li><span class="listory">More than two thirds of Americans now believe that the Bush administration is either hiding something or lying about its relationship with Enron, according to a CBS-New York Times poll.</span></li>
<p class="story">Although no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the White House, the poll underlined the political damage that could be inflicted on Mr Bush by the collapse of Enron, which was a major contributor to his presidential election campaign.</p>
<p class="story">A post mortem examination at the weekend confirmed that Clifford Baxter, 43, whose death on Friday escalated the scandal, had shot himself with a revolver. Mr Baxter resigned as Enron vice-chairman last May after clashing with fellow executives over the company's practices.
