<p> WASHINGTON -- After remaining steady for months, Americans' support for U.S. 
military action in Iraq has softened in recent weeks, two polls indicated Wednesday.
<p>The apparent drop in enthusiasm for war comes as U.S. officials report progress 
in U.N. negotiations aimed at crafting a resolution that would send weapons inspectors 
back to Iraq and possibly set the stage for a U.S. invasion.
<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Wednesday that U.N. Security Council 
members were getting much closer to agreeing on a resolution and that he expects 
work to be completed before the end of next week.
<p> Powell also said he believes it will take "a matter of months" once inspections 
begin for U.N. weapons experts to determine whether Iraq is producing weapons 
of mass destruction. His comments suggest that any military action might not occur 
before late winter.
<p>A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center from Oct. 17 to Oct. 27 found that 
55% of Americans support an attack on Iraq. That was down from 62% earlier in 
the month and 64% in August.
<p>The poll found that a large percentage of Americans are worried about the possible 
consequences of a military campaign, including high U.S. casualties and increased 
terrorist attacks on the United States. And it indicated that Americans are reluctant 
to back military action unless the United States has support from allies.
<p>A poll by Fox News with slightly different wording found that support for a 
military campaign had declined from 72% to 62% in recent weeks. But a Gallup Poll 
conducted Oct. 21-22 showed no decline.
<p>Carroll Doherty, editor at the Pew Research Center, said he believes that the 
slippage is noteworthy after months of stability. He said the dip may reflect 
the fact that President Bush has not been actively campaigning recently to build 
nationwide support for military action.
<p>John Gorman, president of Opinion Dynamics Corp., which conducted the poll 
for Fox, said the decline may reflect the fact that news coverage of the possible 
war with Iraq has evolved into a story about U.N. diplomacy "that is inherently 
confusing. Without constant reinforcement of the importance of this, support erodes."
<p>He said the erosion may also reflect, to a lesser extent, the fact that opponents 
of the war have become more visible in recent days.
<p>The Pew poll, which sampled the views of 1,751 adults, found increased opposition 
to the war among Democrats. For the first time since the debate over the war intensified 
last summer, a minority of Democrats, 49%, support the war.
<p>Like earlier polls, this survey suggested that Bush needs allied support to 
keep U.S. public backing for an attack on Iraq. Twenty-seven percent said they 
would favor military action if allies did not go along, down from 33% in mid-September.
<p>In Washington, officials continued to press forward in their planning.
<p>Bush met for 10 minutes at the White House with chief U.N. weapons inspector 
Hans Blix and Mohammed Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Blix and Baradei also met with Powell, Vice President Dick Cheney and National 
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.
<p>Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, described the meetings as part 
of a round of consultations Blix is conducting in the capitals of the five permanent 
members of the Security Council.
<p>Powell, in an interview with National Public Radio, was asked how long the 
United States would wait to see how inspections were faring.
<p>"It's certainly a matter of months before Dr. Blix and ... Mr. El Baradei would 
come back and say we have made our determination whether or not &#91;the Iraqis&#93; 
are continuing to pursue this kind of technology," Powell said. "We understand 
that it will take time, and the president understands that means that we will 
have to wait for them to do their work and complete their report."
<p>One U.S. official suggested this week that if the Security Council appeared 
headed toward failure in its negotiations, the Bush administration might delay 
the outcome until after election day -- to avoid an embarrassing defeat, and heightened 
fears of war, just before voters head to the polls. 
<p>But other officials said the negotiations were still making progress toward 
a compromise. They added that in any case, U.N. negotiations almost always take 
longer than planned.
