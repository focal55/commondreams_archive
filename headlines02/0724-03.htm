<p>UGBORODO, Nigeria - Elisabeth Omogobohe brushes against the crumbling walls 
of what was once her home and points to the bedroom where rival tribesmen hacked 
her husband to death. 
<p> "The Ijaws burned down my house. They killed my husband. Everything burned, 
finished," said the 60-year-old widow as she recounted the attack on her village 
three years ago. Today she lives next door in a hut made of tin scraps.

</font>Competition over oil money fueled the ethnic violence that has shattered 
villages across southeast Nigeria's Niger Delta, killing thousands in the past 
decade. 
<p> The prospect of more ethnic violence lingers, even after Omogobohe and other 
women from her village won promises of jobs, electricity and other amenities after 
a peaceful 11-day occupation of ChevronTexaco's multimillion-dollar Escravos export 
terminal. 
<p> Villagers accuse oil companies of fanning resentment between the two main 
tribes in the area surrounding Escravos &#151; the Ijaws and the Itsekiris &#151; 
by forcing the longtime rivals to jostle for scant jobs. 
<p> The Ijaws' resentment toward the Itsekiris dates to the 19th century, when 
the Ijaws accused Nigeria's former British rulers of giving the Itsekiris preferential 
treatment. 
<p> The Ijaws say that kind of treatment continues today under foreign oil companies. 
<p> The rivalry played out sharply last week. After Itsekiri villagers launched 
their unprecedented all-woman takeover of the Escravos oil terminal, which exports 
nearly a half-million barrels of crude oil a day, the Ijaw quickly sprang into 
all-women occupations of their own. 
<p> Ijaw women seized at least four pipeline stations that feed into the Escravos 
terminal. 
<p> They are demanding that half of all workers at Escravos' new gas plant be 
Ijaws, that tribe members be given management jobs in human resources and public 
affairs departments, and that the company appoint an Ijaw director. 
<p> That is more than what the Itsekiri women got: a promise of 25 new jobs over 
five years at the Escravos terminal and an assurance that 15 contract workers 
will be made permanent staff. 
<p> Some more radical Ijaw activists have threatened violence if their demands 
are not met. Kingsley Kuku, spokesman for the tribal Ijaw Youth Council warned 
Ijaw men would "burn down all Chevron oil facilities" and attack Itsekiri villages. 
<p> ChevronTexaco negotiators continued talks with the Ijaw women on Tuesday, 
the company's Nigeria spokesman Wole Agunbiade said. 
<p> Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest exporter of oil and the fifth-largest 
supplier to the United States. Nigeria's production of 2 million barrels of oil 
a day &#151; almost all from the Niger Delta &#151; leads that of African nations. 
<p> The Niger Delta remains one of the Nigeria's poorest and least developed regions, 
despite its oil wealth, however. 
<p> Bloody conflicts are common in an impoverished region where people have little 
to lose. 
<p> A dispute over municipal boundaries in 1997 escalated into a three-year war 
between the two tribes, leaving entire villages razed and hundreds killed. 
<p> The tribes attacked each other with machetes and guns, believing their rivals 
were trying to gain control of oil land so they could press oil multinationals 
for demands. Both sides remember that dark period as "the crisis." 
<p> Accusations are now flying that protests by women of both tribes are aimed 
at advancing each tribe's influence over ChevronTexaco. 
<p> "If we do not do this, the Itsekiris will say this is their own place," protest 
leader Josephine Ogoba said, explaining why Ijaw women took over the pipeline 
stations. 
<p> ChevronTexaco insists no one tribe is favored. "The policy for hiring is a 
very open and competitive," Agunbiade said. "If you have what they want, they 
will hire you, wherever you come from." 
<p> Tribal patronage is still seen by many Nigerians as the only way to advance 
in government and private enterprise. 
<p> Ijaws accuse Itsekiris of winning favor because their culture is more open 
to outsiders, explained Esther Tolar, a playwright who is part of the Ijaw occupation. 
<p> Tolar wrote a play about "the crisis" showing the strain on marriages between 
Itsekiris and Ijaws. In the piece, the Itsekiri husband goes into a rage upon 
learning his Ijaw in-laws killed his father. 
<p> "It's not as bad as it was before," Tolar said of relations between the two 
tribes. "But people still carry a lot of anger. You're still reminded this person 
made me fatherless, this person made me a widow or a widower. The pain goes on 
and on."
