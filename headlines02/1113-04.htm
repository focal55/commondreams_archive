<p>KIBBUTZ MEZER, ISRAEL -- After one of the more shocking terrorist attacks in 
the past two years, reprisal was on the mind of many Israelis, including some 
in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's cabinet. Sunday night, five people - including 
two children - were killed at this kibbutz by a Palestinian gunman, who then escaped.

</table>But at a meeting Monday with Mr. Sharon, leaders of this dovish community wanted 
something else: a commitment that a new, security fence - stretching some 66 miles 
through the West Bank to block terrorist infiltrations - will <I>not</I> be built 
on land taken from their Palestinian neighbors in Kafin village, just across the 
old border in the West Bank.</P>
<P>"As it stands, a grave injustice is being done to our neighbors," said Doron 
Lieber, the economic coordinator of the kibbutz, the only Israeli community to 
argue for rerouting the fence. According to current plans, Kafin would lose two 
square miles - 60 percent of its farmland. Mr. Lieber says this will not only 
be bad for the Palestinians, but bad for the kibbutz, fueling enormous resentment 
throughout the area.</P>
<P>"The moment those beautiful trees are cruelly uprooted, our island of tranquility 
is turned into any other place in Israel," he says.</P>
<P>This kibbutz prides itself on a half century of good relations with neighboring 
Arab Israeli villages. So the irony that it was targeted by a militia linked to 
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement was not lost on anyone, including Palestinian leaders.</P>
<P>But on Monday and Tuesday, it seemed to be precisely that history, as well 
as the kibbutz's humanistic ideology that were coloring the initial responses 
to the attack. "I feel like someone who has been slapped in the face," said Lieber. 
"My hand was stretched out in peace. But a slap in the face is only temporary. 
It rings in your ears a bit, but when the ringing stops you go on."</P>
<P>For others, it will be ringing for a long time. Five-year-old Matan Ohayon's 
crayon-drawn New Year card to his family is still on the door of their house: 
"Happy New Year, I hope we will have a sweet year of happiness and health Love, 
Matan." Matan was shot dead along with his brother, Noam, a year younger, and 
his mother, Revital, whom neighbors believe was clutching the boys to protect 
them. Minutes earlier, the gunman had opened fire outside the kibbutz dining hall, 
killing a woman visitor, Tirza Damari, and then the kibbutz secretary-general, 
Yitzhak Dori, who had rushed to the scene.</P>
<P>Dori's death came as a sharp blow to Tayseer Harasheh, the Kafin town council 
leader who had asked his help in rerouting the fence. "The deaths of our friends 
have left us in shock," he says. "The members of the kibbutz were the only group 
in Israel who stood by us on the issue of the separation fence."</P>
<P>Other kibbutz members took comfort in the large number of visitors who came 
from nearby Arab towns to pay their respects, including a large number from neighboring 
Meisar, from which the kibbutz derives its name.</P>
<P>"All of Meisar came here, just like for a wedding," says Dov Zir. Mr. Zir is 
one of the founders of the kibbutz, mostly immigrants from Argentina who were 
members of HaShomer HaZair, the socialist Zionist movement whose ideology stresses 
peaceful coexistence. "Mezer is a very ideological kibbutz, it not only talks 
about coexistence, it lives it," says Aviv Leshem, spokesman for HaShomer HaZair.</P>
<P>After two years of conflict that have left most of Israel's Arab and Jewish 
citizens separated by a gulf of suspicion, Meisar's children still come to Mezer 
every day to play basketball. "We still go over there and feel good, and they 
come to us and feel good," says Bahaa Amarneh, a student from Meisar. Meisar residents 
say Mezer was built partly on land belonging to their village in 1953. But good 
ties evolved nevertheless. Meisar later proposed that Mezer share its water supply, 
and the two communities still use the same pipeline.</P>
<P>Several Mezer members stress that whoever carried out the attack was not representative 
of Palestinians as a whole. "There are a few of them who are ready to murder in 
the name of God," says Yehoshua Mondrich, a veteran kibbutz member. "Most are 
good people, but a cruel minority imposes itself on them." He says he plans to 
resume work in the avocado fields, where he supervises Palestinian workers from 
Kafin, still a source of cheap labor for the kibbutz.</P>
<P>But Ariel Gabai, another member, told reporters: "I've been active in Peace 
Now for years and I continue to say that one idiot who shoots in a house won't 
change my mind. But the more time passes, the more I understand that the problem 
is not entirely on our side, but rather on the other side."</P>
<P>Mohammed Hourani, a legislator from Fatah, says the attack was a violation 
of Fatah's position not to harm civilians inside Israel: "We know that this area 
is filled with Israelis who believe in peace so we announced clearly this time 
that we feel sorry for the victims of this attack."</P>
