<p>LAGOS, NIGERIA</B> - The town museum in Calabar, southern Nigeria, contains 
a striking section on a 1929 Niger Delta protest known as the "women's war." The 
conflict, which stemmed from opposition to British colonial rule, escalated after 
villagers in the Owerri province clashed with a mission teacher carrying out a 
tax assessment. Local women sent folded fresh palm leaves to neighboring communities 
as a signal to begin attacks against buildings symbolizing the imperial presence.</P>

Hundreds of Ijaw women protest inside a fuel station in Abiteye, Nigeria in this 
photo taken on Tuesday, July 16, 2002. The Ijaw women took over the flow station 
soon after the Itsekeris had taken over the ChevronTexaco oil terminal in Escravos, 
to ensure that their tribe got a better deal from Chevron and did not have to 
lag behind the Itsekeris. (AP Photo/Saurabh Das) <br>

</table></font></font></font>"The white men should return to their own country," says a piece of contemporary 
propaganda quoted at the museum, "so that the land in the area may remain as it 
was many years before the advent of the white man."</P>
<P>More than 70 years later, the women of the oil-rich delta are stirring once 
more. On Thursday, hundreds of women blocked the gates of ChevronTexaco and Shell 
offices in the southern port of Warri. For several hours, workers at the two locations 
were kept from entering or leaving the facilities. By Friday, the protest had 
ended peacefully.</P>
<P>This protest was the latest in a month of all-women demonstrations that began 
July 8 with a 10-day siege of ChevronTexaco's offices in Escravos. Observers say 
that protests by women are becoming the most effective tool to force social improvements 
by US multinational oil companies doing business in Africa.</P>
<P>The Escravos women, who ranged in age between 30 to 90, used a potent tactic: 
they threatened to take their clothes off. Public nudity would have embarrassed 
the expatriates among the terminal's more than 1,000 workers and caused a deeper 
sense of shame for many Nigerian employees.</P>
<P>"By the time the women bare their chests and go around, people are really in 
trouble," says Bolanle Awe, one of the founders of the Women's Research and Documentation 
Centre at Nigeria's University of Ibadan. "It's a curse on whoever the ruler is."</P>

</table></font></font>The tactics and determination of the Escravos women helped persuade Chevron 
to send senior executives to negotiate concessions. The company agreed to employ 
more local people, invest in electricity supply and other infrastructure projects, 
and assist the villagers in setting up poultry and fish farms to supply the terminal's 
cafeteria. The social gains apparently secured by the Escravos women contrast 
with the frequent violent and fruitless clashes that have taken place between 
young men and the police and army.</P>
<P>"They knew if the women went the authorities wouldn't use force," says one 
person familiar with the local villages. "That's what they were betting on."</P>
<P>The protests often reflect widespread frustration among delta people at the 
disconnect between the wealth springing from their land and the lack of local 
development. Nigeria, one of the world's top 10 oil producers, has earned some 
$250 billion in oil revenues over the past four decades. The squandering of the 
money because of governmental corruption, together with the pollution and disruption 
often caused by the oil companies, has nurtured a deep sense of popular bitterness.</P>
<P>The protests echo a tradition of female dissent in the delta that stretches 
well beyond the anti-imperial demonstrations of the late 1920s. The trend has 
spawned at least one book &#150; "Nigerian Women Mobilized" (University of California, 
Berkeley, 1982) &#150; an account of women's political activity in southern Nigeria 
from 1900 to 1965. The author, Nina Emma Mba, said protest has occurred on both 
individual and collective levels, within and across communal boundaries, and has 
involved both peaceful and violent methods.</P>
<P>"Generally their political activity has in- cluded only women," she wrote. 
"[It] has been informed by a shared consciousness of being a disadvantaged sex 
with special interests."</P>
<P>The activism of southern Nigerian women may have further roots in religious 
and commercial practices. Graham Furniss, professor of African languages and literature 
at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, notes that the south of the 
country has a greater focus on market trading by women and a lower concentration 
of Muslims than the north. "In an Islamic society, the role of women tends to 
be quite different, particularly in a public arena such as markets," Professor 
Furniss says. "It's not that they aren't organized and don't have views &#150; 
but they wouldn't necessarily have the public presence that's necessary for concerted, 
open political action."</P>
<P>The flurry of female radicalism is far removed from the coordinated, Internet-assisted 
campaigns against multinationals in industrialized countries. The villages around 
the Escravos terminal have no access to telephones or computers. Travel is difficult 
and costly as well; a trip from Escravos to Warri takes three hours by boat and 
costs $6, a week's pay for the average Nigerian.</P>
