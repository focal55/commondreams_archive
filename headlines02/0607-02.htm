<p> BALI, Indonesia - Ministers struggled on Friday to wrap up vital talks aimed 
at providing a political springboard for a U.N. summit in August that hopes to 
slash poverty and save the environment. 
<P> Officials said final preparatory meetings on the Indonesian resort island 
of Bali might fail to reach full agreement on a draft plan for the World Summit 
on Sustainable Development in South Africa, putting off some thorny issues for 
the main event. 
<P> With a number of items still unresolved, debate might last into the early 
evening before concluding, they said. 
<P> Dubbed Earth Summit 2, the conference in Johannesburg is being billed as the 
largest-ever UN gathering. More than 100 heads of state and 60,000 delegates are 
expected to attend. 
<P> Environmentalists taking part in the Bali talks at a pricey hotel complex 
were scathing of the progress, saying the plan would do little to help three billion 
people -- half the world's population -- who live on less than $2 a day. 
<P> "There is a sense of unreality in this luxury ghetto," said Remi Parmentier, 
political director of Greenpeace. 
<P> "This perhaps explains the mediocrity and lack of ambition in proposals that 
have been put forward. Millions of people will die if we don't get a good, strong 
action plan." 
<P> Ministers have been meeting since Wednesday. 
<P> The summit opens on August 26 and falls a decade after the landmark Earth 
Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which put environmental issues on the global political 
agenda. 
<P> Officials themselves have struggled to kindle enthusiasm for the Johannesburg 
meeting amid a seemingly never-ending cycle of summits and with an agenda that 
covers everything from poverty, water, health and energy to cleaning up the polluted 
planet. 
<P> "I think Bali and Johannesburg (amount to) global indigestion, but I think 
we'll get there," said Mark Malloch Brown, head of the United Nations Development 
Program . 
<P> "We'll hopefully drink lots of stomach settlers between now and Johannesburg 
and synthesize and crystallize this, but it's very ambitious," he told Reuters. 
<P> Aware of the importance of getting key leaders to Johannesburg, U.N officials 
have urged 120 ministers holding environment and development posts meeting here 
to inject political clout into the preparations to ensure Johannesburg avoids 
Rio's fate -- lofty goals, but few results. 
<P> USA AND POOR COUNTRIES FACE OFF 
<P> Earlier in the week, UN officials said most of the draft plan had been agreed 
following 10 days of debate by negotiators, but key differences have proved difficult 
to resolve. 
<P> Some have been between developing nations and the United States over financing 
pledges being drawn up in the plan. 
<P> Poor nations have said they wanted additional aid that was pledged at a summit 
on financing development in Mexico's Monterrey in March to be linked to Johannesburg, 
but that the U.S. was seeking detailed conditions. 
<P> Washington raised its aid at Monterrey in return for poor nations doing things 
such as fighting graft and opening markets. 
<P> Despite the differences, officials here have said there was too much at stake 
politically to let Johannesburg fail, arguing world leaders would get on board, 
even at that last moment. 
<P> Nevertheless, some doubted President Bush would show, putting a dent in the 
summit's credibility. 
<P> "I have to tell you it will be a happy surprise if he was there but I certainly 
am not expecting him to be there," said Malloch Brown. 
<P> Some officials have said Bush might not want to get boxed in by criticism 
of Washington's decision to reject the Kyoto Protocol and recent moves, such as 
hiking agriculture subsidies. 
<P> The US cited cost grounds in rejecting Kyoto, which commits developed countries 
to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
<P> Ministers in Bali are also in the process of drawing up an agenda and the 
outlines of a political declaration to be made by leaders at Johannesburg -- although 
much of that has been subsumed by debate over the action plan. 
<P> Some targets for the plan were agreed at the UN Millennium Summit, which called 
for halving by 2015 the number of people living on less than $1 a day.
