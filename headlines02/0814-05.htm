<p> JERUSALEM</strong> -- Declaring there is "no time left" to waste before returning 
to the negotiating table with Palestinians, the popular mayor of Israel's northern 
city of Haifa declared his candidacy Tuesday for the Labor Party chairmanship 
and for prime minister. 
<P>Leftists hope that Amram Mitzna's entry into the race will reinvigorate the 
flailing party as it struggles to assert its identity while serving in the right-wing 
national unity government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

Amram Mitzna speaks during a press conference in Tel Aviv August 13, 2002. Mitzna, 
the mayor of the Jewish-Arab city of Haifa and a former Israeli army general known 
for his left-wing views, announced on Tuesday his candidacy to lead Israel's Labor 
Party and called for an immediate return to peace talks with the Palestinians. 
&quot;There is no more time. We must, without delay, start talks with the Palestinians, 
so that the two sides can return to the path of peace. There is no need for preconditions,&quot; 
he said. REUTERS/Havakuk Levison <br>

</table></font>A dovish ex-general with 30 years of military service but scant national political 
experience behind him, Mitzna, 57, made his widely anticipated announcement at 
a news conference in Tel Aviv during which he advocated renewed talks with Palestinians 
and an alternative to Sharon's policy of "force, more force and more force" in 
trying to defuse 23 months of violence. 
<P>"Ariel Sharon is leading us to a disaster. Nothing he is doing on security 
and economic issues is getting us anywhere. That's why so many citizens have lost 
hope," Mitzna said -- adding, however, that Israel will "continue to strike at 
terror and to use every means to destroy it." 
<P>In recent days, Mitzna has outlined a political vision that includes a peace 
deal in which Palestinians would receive all of the Gaza Strip and 95 percent 
of the West Bank. 
<P>The plan is similar to that offered by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak to 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the Camp David peace summit in 2000. 
<P>The summit ultimately failed and was followed by a new Palestinian uprising 
in September that year and the deadly round of suicide bombings and retribution 
killings that grips Israel today. 
<P><b>UNILATERAL BORDERS</b> 
<P>Mitzna said that if new peace talks with the Palestinians were to fail within 
a given time frame, he would draw Israel's border unilaterally and uproot Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank east of the line. 
<P>That would put him at odds with Jewish settlers, but not for the first time: 
<P>As commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank during the 1987-to-1993 Palestinian 
uprising, Mitzna was often accused by Jewish settlers of being too soft on Palestinians 
-- and by leftists of being too harsh. 
<P>"A unilateral move is obviously less good than a peace agreement, but it would 
bring us security separation and a secure border," he said. "The world will then 
have to advance Palestinian society, and a new diplomatic horizon and peace agreement 
will be the eventual result." 
<P>An international force would rule Jerusalem's Old City, with Jews responsible 
for their holy sites and Muslims for theirs, he said. 
<P>Asked whether he would follow Sharon's lead in sidelining Arafat as a peace 
partner, Mitzna said Israel "cannot choose" Palestinian leaders but added that 
he would not meet with the Palestinians prior to the election. 
<P>Opinion polls suggest that Mitzna, who was decorated for his role in the 1973 
Yom Kippur war, will be a candidate to be reckoned with in the Labor primary in 
November. 
<P>A survey in Yerushaliyim newspaper of 401 Labor Party members found that the 
Haifa mayor would easily defeat the two other candidates -- Defense Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eliezer and Haim Ramon -- if Labor primaries for party chairman and prime 
ministerial candidate were held today. 
<P>Fifty-two percent of respondents said they would back Mitzna, compared with 
36 percent for Ben-Eliezer and 16 percent for Ramon. 
<P>That bodes well for Mitzna in the short term, but experts say the weakened 
state of the party means it faces an almost insurmountable challenge when it comes 
to confronting Sharon's Likud party in the next general election, scheduled for 
October 2003. 
<P><b>SHARON STILL THE MAN TO BEAT</b> 
<P>Labor has never recovered from Barak's landslide defeat by Sharon. And though 
Sharon's popularity has fallen in the polls from 70 percent to 50 percent, he 
is still clearly the man to beat. 
<P>"All we can do is extrapolate from polls that suggest it doesn't really matter 
who is leader -- the party will still lose, although it seems (Mitzna's candidacy) 
would give it a better chance," said Israeli political analyst Mark Heller. 
<P>He attributed Mitzna's current strong showing in the polls at least partly 
to "enthusiasm for a new face" and appreciation for someone who has the strong 
military record that has often been a prerequisite of any Israeli who hopes to 
make it big in the political arena. 
<P>"People always get excited when there is someone not compromised by a long 
history of national politics. You can equate it to the man on horseback -- the 
white knight who comes in to save the situation. But if the past is anything to 
go by, the bloom goes off the rose pretty quickly," Heller said. Barak, Sharon 
and former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin all came to office with similar credentials 
and struggled in the face of the intractable Palestinian conflict. 
<P>Critics say Mitzna lacks political experience, tends to make decisions by himself 
without consultation and is overly cozy with big business, which has funneled 
funds into politics in Haifa. 
<P>The mayor's supporters say he has the right combination of a great military 
past and experience in civil administration needed at this time. Haifa, where 
Mitzna has held office since 1993, is often cited as a city where Jews and Arabs 
live together in relative peace. 
<P>Most Labor parliamentarians have not yet announced whom they are supporting, 
but new blood in the leadership role could prove crucial to sustaining the peace 
camp within the party, where disillusionment is rife over Labor's participation 
in the hawkish Sharon-led government. 
<P><b>LABOR'S LEFT WING ALIENATED</b> 
<P>Ben-Eliezer's role in keeping it there and his leadership, as defense minister, 
in major military offensives against the Palestinians, has particularly alienated 
the left wing of the party. Prominent Labor figures, including former Justice 
Minister Yossi Beilin, an architect of interim peace deals with the Palestinians, 
have said they would leave the party if Ben-Eliezer remained party chief. 
<P>The Labor race has drawn more attention than might be expected because of threats 
by Labor to vote in October against Sharon's 2003 budget, which would cut social 
welfare programs while preserving subsidies for settlers. The prime minister has 
warned that he would call early elections if Labor made good on its threats, meaning 
that elections would then be held within 90 days of Sharon's decision, or nine 
months ahead of schedule. 
<P>A future showdown with the hawkish prime minister would be familiar ground 
for Mitzna, who as a brigadier general during the Lebanon war demanded at a conference 
of officers that Sharon, who was then defense minister, resign from his position. 
<P>Only intervention by the chief of staff and then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin, 
saved Mitzna from being summarily discharged.</p>
