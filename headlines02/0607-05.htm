<p>With India and Pakistan on the brink of war, British peace activists are planning to mount a demonstration on the streets of London Saturday, urging the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair  to stop selling arms to the nuclear-armed neighbors who have already fought each other three times since 1948.
<p>
<a href="http://www.caat.org.uk/" target="_new">Campaign Against the Arms Trade</a> (CAAT) said Thursday that the demonstration--which would kick off a week-long campaign against the sale of weapons by British arms manufacturers--was aimed at pressuring Westminster lawmakers to impose an arms embargo on the South Asian subcontinent.
<p>




"We are concerned that continuing weapons sales might increase tension and exacerbate possibilities of a conflict," said CAAT's media coordinator Richard Bingley. "Long-term respect for the sanctity of human life is more important than making a quick buck through arms sales," he added.
<p>



CAAT underscored the contradictory role Britain was playing in the region, on the one hand acting as an advocate for de-escalation of the Indo-Pakistan crisis--which has reached fever pitch after a series of attacks and counter-attacks over the disputed territory of Kashmir  --and on the other, heightening tensions through encouraging the purchase of arms.
<p>




During a visit to India in February, British foreign secretary Jack Straw lobbied New Delhi to buy US&#36;1.43 billion in Hawk training jets. Straw, who was in the region again last month, was also urging a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
<p>



In 2000, Britain sold India weapons including components for air-surface missiles and aircraft machine guns worth &#36;94.2 million. British sales to Pakistan were worth &#36;8.76 million and included components for combat helicopters.
<p>



"Our demonstration is going to say 'enough is enough' to politicians," Bingley said. "There must be an immediate cessation of arms sales to India and Pakistan because of the high tension."
<p>



In New Delhi, a defense ministry spokesman refused to comment on the campaigner's demand for arms sanctions against India, saying only, "We know our operational requirements and we can deal with any eventuality."
<p>


&#9;

Saturday's demonstration outside Prime Minister Blair's official residence in Downing Street is designed to launch a week of events to raise awareness of Britain's role in the global arms trade. CAAT last week sent letters to lawmakers in the House of Commons, urging them to put pressure on the government for tighter controls on arms sales.
<p>




CAAT's concerns were echoed in India and Pakistan as well, with peace activists releasing a statement earlier this week that urged General Pervez Musharaff of Pakistan and India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to show restraint.
<p>




"Wars have offered no solutions in the past," said the statement signed by, among others, Pakistani human rights activist Asma Jehangir, internationally-renowned writer Arundhati Roy, and Rajinder Sachar, a founder member of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, a prominent Indian campaigns group.
<p>




"[War] will deepen the conflict between the two countries, add to the burden of military spending, reinforce militaristic and chauvinistic elements, and negate the process of democratization and development," according to the statement, which pointed to the three wars already fought between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan.
<p>




In recent weeks, India and Pakistan have come perilously close to a fourth war. Tension has been mounting in the region ever since a group of Kashmir militants--who New Delhi claims were based in Pakistan--attacked the Indian Parliament last December, killing 14 people. Since then, the two countries have amassed a million soldiers on either side of their shared border.
