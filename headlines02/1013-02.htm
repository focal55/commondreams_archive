            <p>Under the hot sun, a metal railing snakes its way incongruously 
              through the hills. On one side are olive groves. On the other, huge 
              banana plantations rear up. This is the Green Line, the 1967 border 
              between Israel and the occupied West Bank &#150; and the setting 
              for a very unusual meeting between Palestinian farmers and Israelis 
              from a nearby kibbutz.</p>
            <p>The Palestinians are not allowed to cross the railing into Israel, 
              the Israelis are not supposed to cross it into the West Bank, but 
              they meet here to talk together across the barrier. The olive groves 
              belong to Palestinians from the village of Kafin, the banana plantations 
              to Israelis from Kibbutz Metser. Although they have been neighbors 
              for half a century, few could remember ever meeting like this before.</p>
            <p>The reason for this extraordinary gathering is that the Israeli 
              government is planning to build a wall to separate them completely. 
              Not a metal railing like the small section here, which was begun 
              a few years ago to stop cars crossing, but a full Berlin-style concrete 
              wall that will carve its way through the hills, complete with pillboxes 
              and Israeli snipers to shoot anyone who tries to cross it. The official 
              reason is to prevent Palestinian suicide bombers crossing into Israel.</p>
            <p>The wall will not run along the path of the Green Line, however. 
              Here it will be some 400 to 800 yards east, cutting off the Palestinian 
              farmers completely from their land &#150; for most of them, their 
              only source of income.</p>
            <p>But the Israeli government has run up against an unexpected source 
              of opposition &#150; the people of Kibbutz Metser. There are few 
              more potent symbols of Israel than the kibbutzim, the communes of 
              Jewish families which encapsulated the spirit of the young country 
              in its early days.</p>
            <p>"We think if a wall has to be built here it should be built on 
              the Green Line," said Dov Avital, a leader from the kibbutz. Dressed 
              in the scruffy gray T-shirt and work trousers of a no-nonsense kibbutznik, 
              he stood side by side with the neatly groomed Palestinian Mayor 
              of Kafin, who was wearing a tie despite the intense heat.</p>
            <p>"If land has to be destroyed, we offer our own land," Mr Avital 
              went on. "If a wide strip of land has to be uprooted, we say it 
              should be shared equally between both sides." In the distance the 
              Israeli army had already begun cutting down Palestinian olive trees 
              to make way for the wall.</p>
            <p>The facts are stark. The planned course of the wall will cut off 
              80 per cent of the farming land from the village of Kafin. Most 
              of the village's 10,000 people will lose all their income. There 
              are supposedly plans to issue permits for Palestinian farmers to 
              cross. But according to the Mayor of Kafin, the nearest gate in 
              the wall will involve a six-mile detour. And there are no guarantees 
              they will all get permits.</p>
            <p>Kafin is not an isolated case. Throughout the West Bank, the wall 
              will be a disaster for Palestinians. Long sections of it will not 
              follow the Green Line, but will cut swathes out of Palestinian territory, 
              permanently cutting off thousands of farmers from their land. Some 
              Palestinian villages will be stranded on the Israeli side of the 
              wall, but the villagers will not be allowed into Israel proper.</p>
            <p>Some observers believe the reason for not putting the wall on the 
              Green Line is that Ariel Sharon's government fears that could make 
              it into a de facto border for a future Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>"My father's land used to be over there, on the other side of the 
              Green Line," said Ibrahiam Suleiman, one of the Palestinian farmers. 
              "Now they are taking away what was left after 1948 [when the Palestinians 
              were cut off from their land in the new state of Israel]." He has 
              six children to support and no means of income other than his olive 
              trees.</p>
            <p>One of the Israelis from the kibbutz, Yohanan Margalit, was translating 
              for Mr Suleiman, who spoke no English. We asked the Palestinian 
              farmer what he would do. Mr Margalit, the translator, was visibly 
              shocked at his answer. "He says all that is left for him is to die," 
              he translated. "If they take your land from you, what else can you 
              do?"</p>
            <p>The Israeli shrugged. "I feel a little powerless to do anything 
              about this," he said. "You can speak to your government, but they 
              don't listen." </p>
