<p>NOT long ago, before the accounting scandals at Enron, WorldComand other companies, 
workers often saw themselves as management's best buddies. Gone was the old, us-against-them 
mentality in which workers viewed C.E.O.'s as robber barons intent on squeezing 
them for every last dollar. </p>
<P> In its place was a new world in which workers, with their stock options and 
401(k) plans loaded with company stock, saw themselves as allied with management, 
not opposed to it. Pointing to the dot-com phenomenon, management theorists talked 
of a New Economy paradigm in which workers would link arms with executives because 
they were just as eager as their bosses to maximize company profits and stock 
prices.</p>
<P> The notion of worker exploitation was largely forgotten, at least among white-collar 
and high-technology employees, because it seemed so Old Economy. Corporate executives 
fostered an egalitarian atmosphere by using the same cafeterias and parking lots 
as their subordinates. They embraced an inclusive vocabulary in which workers 
were partners, associates, even fellow entrepreneurs, and to make workers identify 
with them, managers rewarded their new partners with stock options, bonuses and 
discount stock purchase plans. </p>
<P> "In the 90's, half of American households became investors, so the line between 
being an employee and an investor began to blur," former Labor Secretary Robert 
B. Reich said. "People were happy because it looked as if a rapidly rising tide 
was lifting all boats." Workers hardly seemed to worry about the need for workplace 
protections. With the economy and Wall Street booming, it seemed silly to fret 
about layoffs. Workers were busy boasting about, not worrying about, the size 
of their retirement nest eggs.</p>
<P> To this new species of investor-worker, unions seemed irrelevant. Unions made 
little headway as they sought to lure workers by promising the basic protections 
coveted in decades past, like health coverage and defined-benefit pensions. Union 
membership remained flat even as the 1990's boom created more than 15 million 
jobs. For many workers, the collective approach seemed anachronistic because they 
were confident that management would protect them or they could protect themselves. 
</p>
<P> This logic seemed unassailable during the boom. But the paradigm began to 
crack with the high-tech bust and resulting layoffs, and crumbled with the recession 
and the Enron-led wave of scandals. At Enron, 4,200 workers were laid off; at 
WorldCom, 17,000.</p>
<P> Cara Alcantar, who accumulated 1,600 stock options in her four years at WorldCom, 
said she was naïve to identify with WorldCom's chief executive. "I felt on the 
same side as Bernie Ebbers, on the cutting edge of technology," she said. "I worked 
extremely hard, and I couldn't imagine layoffs would ever happen to me.'</p>
<P> But on July 3, she was laid off. Now her stock options are worthless, WorldCom 
says it cannot pay her severance benefits, and the half of her retirement savings 
that were in WorldCom stock are virtually worthless. "Not only were they not looking 
out for our interests," Ms. Alcantar said, "they were so greedy they made sure 
the money went into their pockets." </p>
<P> Before, she said, joining a union had never crossed her mind, but now she 
says she wishes WorldCom were unionized. With a union, she says, she might have 
had a defined-benefit pension that, unlike her vaporized 401(k) plan, would have 
guaranteed her benefits even after the stock market plunged. Labor leaders say 
that if Enron or WorldCom were unionized, unions would have won better pensions 
and severance benefits for the workers and, through their prying, might have forced 
the companies to be more honest about their books.</p>
<P> "We're seeing a real waking up across the nation because millions of workers 
are seeing that their economic futures are far less secure than they had been 
led to believe," said Harley Shaiken, a specialist in labor issues at the University 
of California at Berkeley.</p>
<P> A SURVEY released last week by Peter D. Hart Associates found that 66 percent 
of workers said they trusted their employers just some or not much at all. Such 
numbers, labor experts say, suggest that the nation may have reached a watershed 
in which workers conclude that they need collective protections to safeguard them 
from predatory executives and economic downturns.</p>
<P> It is unclear whether a deus ex machina will materialize to rescue the beleaguered 
workers. The most likely candidates are Washington, which seems uninterested, 
and organized labor, which is weak. </p>
<P> Since the Enron scandal, President Bush and Congress have done little to protect 
workers even as they have rushed to protect investors. That is a far cry from 
1963, when the Studebaker automobile company went under and more than 4,000 workers 
lost their pensions. In response, Congress, with a Republican senator, Jacob K. 
Javits, taking the lead, passed legislation that created strict pension protections. 
</p>
<P> The post-Enron Congress has shunned even modest protections like rules to 
require companies to make promised severance payments or to let workers elect 
representatives to the board of their 401(k) plans. </p>
<P> The Hart survey showed that workers are warming to unions, with 50 percent 
of nonunion workers saying they wanted to join a union, the highest level in two 
decades. </p>
<P> It was labor's clout in Congress and collective bargaining that created the 
nation's system of worker protections, including the 40-hour week, pensions, health 
coverage and job safety rules. But unions are weak, representing less than 10 
percent of the private-sector work force, down from 35 percent in the 1950's. 
Unions have been notably unsuccessful in wooing workers from New Economy industries, 
like software.</p>
<P> The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, said he saw a pendulum swing 
in favor of collective protections. "One Enron worker told me, `We trusted our 
employer, and liked our job, but when they threw us on on the street, we lost 
all trust,' " Mr. Sweeney said. "A lot of workers are saying to themselves, `The 
same thing can happen to me.' "</p>
