WASHINGTON — In an e-mail message sent last year while the Bush administration was formulating a national energy policy, a senior Energy Department official posed this question to a lobbyist for a major natural gas interest: "If you were king, or Il Duce, what would you include in a national energy policy, especially with respect to natural gas issues?"
<P> The message was sent by Joseph Kelliher, who was a political appointee in the Energy Department. Last spring, Mr. Kelliher was a major contributor to Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force.</p>
<P> Mr. Kelliher's invitation for input was seized by the lobbyist, Dana Contratto, who responded with an array of pro-industry proposals.</p>
<P> The e-mail exchange was released on Thursday night by the Energy Department in response to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits brought by Judicial Watch and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Both groups had sued the Bush administration for records about White House energy policy.</p>
<P> Jeanne Lopatto, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, described Mr. Contratto as an expert on natural gas issues.</p>
<P> "He has a fine reputation for independent thinking," Ms. Lopatto said. "The administration had two basic choices on how to develop a national energy policy: it could close its doors and shut its ears and turn off its phones and write a national energy policy in isolation, or it could consult with experts, listen to the public and incorporate the good ideas and reject the bad ideas.</p>
<P> Mr. Contratto, a partner with the law and lobbying firm Crowell & Moring, suggested several new initiatives, including that the administration endorse an increase in the gas transmission operating pressures.</p>
<P> "With higher pressures, more gas moves," Mr. Contratto wrote in the March 22, 2001, message. "Obviously, some pipelines could not handle such higher pressures, but new pipelines could be built to move more gas at such higher pressures."</p>
<P> Ms. Lopatto said that none of Mr. Contratto's suggestions were incorporated in the national energy report. The memorandums with the reference to Mr. Kelliher's request for information had been released several weeks ago, but at that time Mr. Kelliher's invitation for suggestions had been whited out. </p>
<P> "Of course, I'm glad that the Energy Department corrected their previous error," said Sharon Buccino, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "I wish that they had done it right the first time, in compliance with the judge's order and before the Senate passed its energy bill."</p>
<P> Ms. Lopatto said Mr. Kelliher's e-mail messages "had been inadvertently redacted by the Justice Department."</p>
<P> A federal judge had ordered the Departments of Commerce, Energy and Transportation to release the documents earlier this year. The messages were part of the batch of 400 pages of documents that were released late Thursday by the Energy Department.</p>
