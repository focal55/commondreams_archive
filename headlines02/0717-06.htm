<p>BANGKOK - Myanmar's ruling junta rejected an Amnesty International report on 
Wednesday that said the military was using forced labor, extortion and torture 
in a campaign to stamp out separatist insurgencies.
<p>The human rights group said the ethnic Shan, Mon and Karen  populations in eastern Myanmar were struggling to survive in  the face of army demands on their livelihood.<p>"The situation for civilians in the east of Myanmar is  cause for grave concern," Amnesty said.<p>"The government needs to show it is serious about human  rights improvements throughout the country by taking urgent  steps to protect civilians from forced labor, extortion and  land confiscation at the hands of its armed forces."<p>Three significant ethnic minority rebel groups are fighting  the junta's rule -- the Shan State Army (SSA), Karen National  Union and Karenni National Progressive Party. The military has  ruled Myanmar, formerly Burma, for 40 years.<p>Myanmar's human rights record has been widely condemned by  the international community and sanctions have pushed its  tottering economy to the brink of collapse.<p>In a statement, the Myanmar junta said the information for  Amnesty's report had come from people associated with rebel  groups who wanted to discredit the government.<p>"It is quite natural for these armed terrorist groups to  come up with ridiculous assertions in order for them to gain  sympathy and financial support," it said.<p>SIGNS OF HOPE<p>Amnesty said human rights had improved in Myanmar in some  respects. Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released  from house arrest in May and has been holding confidential  talks with the junta for almost two years.<p>More than 300 political prisoners have been released since  the talks began, but hundreds remain behind bars.<p>Amnesty said despite improvements in some areas, urgent  action was needed to save minority groups from abuses.<p>One Shan villager was quoted as saying her friend, Zaye  Seng, had died in December 2001 a year after being severely  tortured.<p>"He told me he was beaten for five nights," the woman was  quoted as saying. "When he came back his nose and eyes were  dripping in blood from head injuries. They submerged him in  water. They accused him of giving rice to the SSA."<p>Amnesty said civilians were made to do construction work on  roads and military camps, work on military farms, and act as  porters for soldiers for days or weeks at a time.<p>Forced labor had been outlawed in Myanmar but the order was  being flouted by the military, it said.<p>"The Myanmar government needs to ensure that the order  reaches all levels of the military," it said.<p>"In addition, they must inform villagers of their rights in  languages they understand."<p>It said the military constantly demanded cash and food,  leaving many subsistence farmers with insufficient food to feed  themselves and their families.<p>Earlier this month, the junta rejected allegations that  hundreds of ethnic Shan women had been raped by Myanmar troops  fighting insurgency. The United States urged Myanmar to  investigate the allegations.</span>
