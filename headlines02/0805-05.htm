<p>WASHINGTON -- Despite an intensifying debate over military action against Iraq, 
the U.S. military is moving troops, equipment and communications gear into the 
region in an indication that President Bush may order an attack within months 
to drive Saddam Hussein from power. 
<P>Pentagon officials decline to discuss troop movements, but there is little 
doubt among defense experts and a former commander with combat experience in Iraq 
that military leaders are laying the groundwork for an assault sometime next year 
should Bush order it. 
<P>Among the indications of attack preparations, according to experts: 
<P>-- Army Gen. Tommy Franks has moved the headquarters of the Third Army to Kuwait 
from Fort McPherson, Ga. The Third Army would form the backbone of any invasion 
force. 
<P>-- Army units in Kuwait include so-called quartering parties -- soldiers who 
plan the logistics required for the arrival of large numbers of other troops. 
<P>-- The Army's crack 101st Airborne Division is being withdrawn from Afghanistan 
and sent back to Fort Campbell, Ky. The 101st is an air assault division that 
can deploy anywhere within 36 hours. 
<P>"This is a logical thing to do in the context of a coming campaign," said retired 
Army Col. W. Patrick Lang, former chief Middle East intelligence analyst with 
the Defense Intelligence Agency. "To go to Kuwait, then to Baghdad and beyond, 
you need high mobility, and the air mobile division should be brought together 
in its entirety to participate in that." 
<P>Bush has said he wants "a regime change" in Baghdad because of Hussein's efforts 
to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But opposition to military 
action was evident during two days of hearings last week before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
<P>A resolution co-sponsored by California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein demands 
congressional assent before a war with Iraq is launched. 
<P>"There has been no real consultation with Congress, no real laying out of the 
case, no evidence showing complicity with 9/11 by Iraq, no evidence that there's 
a strong multilateral coalition," Feinstein told The Chronicle last week. 
<P>But Anthony Cordesman, a defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington, said there "almost certainly" are preparations being made 
that are "long-lead, low-visibility efforts." 
<P>Recently the military has moved communications gear, including a sophisticated 
air operations center, to Qatar and built up forces and hangars at Qatar's al-Udeid 
air base. The base has a 15,000-foot runway, the longest in the region, that can 
accommodate the Air Force's largest transport planes. 
<P>In addition, the U.S. Maritime Administration, which monitors the fleet of 
cargo ships that would be needed to ship heavy Army weaponry overseas, is closely 
examining the condition of that fleet to ensure they are ready for duty. 
<P>Retired Army Gen. George Joulwan, former commander of NATO, says troop movements, 
especially around the Persian Gulf states of Kuwait and Qatar, are the normal 
positioning of forces given ongoing military operations in Afghanistan. However, 
he said, "they are also prudent in case there is a mission of attacking Iraq." 
<P>The Army has about 20,000 soldiers mainly in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi 
Arabia. The Navy and Marine Corps maintain headquarters staff in Bahrain with 
nearly 3,000 personnel, while the Air Force has several air bases in the region 
including a headquarters in Saudi Arabia. Another 12,000-plus military personnel, 
including Marines and sailors, are spread across several warships in the Persian 
Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. 
<P>In addition, the Army and Marine Corps have had considerable amounts of equipment 
already positioned in the region since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, including tanks 
and other armor. 
<P>Operation Desert Storm, which drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991, required a 
six-month build-up of forces and more than 500,000 U.S. military personnel. But 
various battle concepts under consideration call for attack forces ranging up 
to about 250,000 troops and presumably would require far less time to move to 
the region. </p>
