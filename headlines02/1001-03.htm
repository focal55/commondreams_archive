<p>Saddam Hussein appeared poised last night to agree to resumed UN arms inspections 
in Iraq, in a deft move that looks likely to complicate Washington's resolve to 
unseat him. 
<P>At crucial talks in Vienna with the chiefs of the UN inspection mission, senior 
Iraqi officials for the first time discussed the nitty-gritty of an inspection 
regime abandoned almost four years ago and pledged to supply four years of detailed 
reports on Iraq's dual-use technology which can be deployed for military purposes. 
<P>"They are being positive, businesslike and they're coming with a desire to 
reach an agreement," Mohammad El Baradei, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, 
said of the Iraqi team.

</table></font>Mr El Baradei, the Egyptian head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
which is preparing to send nuclear arms investigators to Iraq with other UN sleuths 
hunting evidence of President Saddam's chemical, biological, and ballistic missile 
arsenals. The UN hopes to have teams of inspectors in Iraq in three weeks. 
<P>A senior source involved in the talks said: "Unless the UN security council 
tells us not to go, we probably will go. The Iraqis are now saying come. 
<P>Hans Blix, the Swedish diplomat who heads the inspectors, said: "Everything 
was discussed. It was the first reading of all the practical arrangements... There 
were many specific clarifications." 
<P>But while UN officials were optimistic about returning to Baghdad to enjoy 
"unfettered access", Donald Rumsfeld, the US defense secretary, described any 
Iraqi pledges on inspections as "patently false". 
<P>With the Vienna talks nearing a breakthrough, and with war apparently hinging 
on the inspection regime and President Saddam's treatment of it, the big question 
was how the US would respond and whether it could push through a new UN resolution 
mandating armed force against Iraq. 
<P>The US, backed by Britain, is meeting strong resistance from Russia and France. 
Senior UN officials in Vienna were also critical of some aspects of the US plans. 
They said there was no point in international troops escorting inspectors, as 
suggested by Washington. 
<P>Although the issue of the new UN resolution overshadowed events in Vienna and 
may have focused Iraqi minds, it did not feature in the talks, said UN diplomats. 
<P>But other sources said both sides were acutely aware of the "dramatic impact" 
that the US draft resolution could have. "All sides are intensely aware that things 
are happening elsewhere," said one official. 
<P>Yesterday's talks focused on the terms for inspections, highly technical conditions 
governing issues such as logistics, security, accommodation, use of equipment, 
access to sites and overflight rights for UN helicopters and aircraft. 
<P>It was the first time such detailed talks had taken place since inspectors 
left Baghdad in 1998 ending almost eight years of scrutiny. And UN diplomats were 
sanguine last night that Iraq would bend. 
<P>One big issue not on the Vienna agenda, however, was Iraq's eight presidential 
palaces replete with estates and facilities that have always been kept closed 
to inspectors. 
<P>"That's an issue we're not discussing. That's for the security council," said 
the senior source. 
<P>And while the rulebook for inspections would be rewritten if a tough new American 
UN resolution prevails, officials insisted this would not change their mandate, 
merely "refine" it. "The basic mandate will not change," said the senior source. 
"We are there for the long haul." 
<P>Once back inside, inspectors would need a year to establish what changes, if 
any, have been made to Iraq's military build-ups, the source added.</p>
