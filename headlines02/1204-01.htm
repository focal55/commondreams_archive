            <p>WASHINGTON --When International ANSWER held a peace rally in October 
              in Washington, officials who had picked the date in August immediately 
              started calling member groups for support - then turned to the Internet 
              for spreading the word.<BR>
              <BR>
              It worked. But it may not work next time.<BR>
              <BR>
              The summer campaign was a success, as 100,000 protesters gathered 
              Oct. 26 near the Vietnam Memorial, trampling wet grass, waving anti-war 
              placards and lambasting President Bush for his stance toward Iraq.<BR>
              <BR>
              "I've been doing this since the Vietnam War, and even 10 years ago, 
              to get people to be on the same page meant you had to ship out thousands 
              of leaflets, frequently to different cities," said ANSWER spokesman 
              Brian Becker. "Now we can put a leaflet up as a PDF file. People 
              take it down and make their own copies."<BR>
              <BR>
              Internet communication has given rise to stronger, faster grass-roots 
              organizations over the past five years, allowing fringe movements 
              to coordinate simultaneous demonstrations around the globe in less 
              than half the time it would have taken during the Persian Gulf War.<BR>
              <BR>
              But as some experts praise the World Wide Web for rejuvenating political 
              efficacy, others are starting to question just how effective the 
              Internet can be in solving social ills. <BR>
              <BR>
              "I get probably 70 to 100 e-mails a day because of all the lists 
              I'm on," said David Levy, an anti-globalization activist. "If the 
              subject line is not compelling or the e-mail is not sent to me several 
              times, I might miss it. E-mail gives the illusion of doing activism, 
              when, in fact, sending out a mass e-mail could be considered equivalent 
              to throwing your work into a black hole."<BR>
              <BR>
              Web-based organization took root three years ago in Seattle, when 
              anti-globalization protesters coordinated events during the World 
              Trade Organization's annual meeting. Roughly 50,000 people converged 
              downtown, closing streets and leading to more than 400 arrests.<BR>
              <BR>
              On a smaller scale, hundreds of demonstrators protested the Republican 
              and Democratic 2000 national conventions in Philadelphia and Los 
              Angeles, respectively. In both instances, Internet bulletin boards 
              helped plan events.<BR>
              <BR>
              Grant Reeher, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse 
              University, co-authored a book this year that followed one such 
              political demonstrator. Reeher said the Internet promoted camaraderie 
              with like-minded activists who had never met.<BR>
              <BR>
              "Large-scale political movements are built on trust," he said. "When 
              you engage in this type of behavior, the risks can be very, very 
              high. Anytime you run against the grain, you need the support of 
              people engaged in it with you."<BR>
              <BR>
              That isn't all. According to Reeher, political efficacy - the idea 
              that someone's actions can effectively create change - has grown 
              because of the Web. This newfound sense of purpose strengthens ties 
              between groups of various interests.<BR>
              <BR>
              The Pew Internet and Political Life Project reported in April that 
              13 million Americans have participated in online lobbying campaigns, 
              while 23 million Americans have sent comments via the Internet to 
              public officials about policy choices.<BR>
              <BR>
              Such use prompted activists to shift their tactics. The Internet 
              allows planners to coordinate simultaneous events in different regions.<BR>
              <BR>
              Evan Henshaw-Plath co-started and runs protest.net, a clearinghouse 
              for grass-roots protests across the globe. He estimates about 10,000 
              page views per day on his site, which lists times, dates and locations 
              of any organized event that gets posted.<BR>
              <BR>
              "People aren't relying on seeing a flier at a campaign or coming 
              across some notice stapled to a telephone pole," he said. "They 
              have a way of finding that information in their own home."<BR>
              <BR>
              But some scholars say the Web is damaging nongovernmental organizations 
              that, before Internet technology, maintained control of their individual 
              agendas.<BR>
              <BR>
              Lance Bennett, a professor at the University of Washington, began 
              following social movements after the WTO protests in 1999. Bennett 
              said that because anyone with a modem can establish websites or 
              send out e-mails, it is harder to manage scripted messages.<BR>
              <BR>
              "When networks are less controlled, some campaigns that begin with 
              strong support may go on long after &#91;reputable groups&#93; decide 
              their goals are satisfied," Bennett said. "If you're a credible 
              actor, people will believe you can stop the campaign."<BR>
              <BR>
              Grass-roots movements also use e-mail to communicate with lawmakers, 
              excessively at times. A 2001 report issued by George Washington 
              University and the Congressional Management Foundation found that, 
              on average, senators receive as many as 55,000 e-mails a month.<BR>
              <BR>
              House offices fare better, attracting as many as 8,000 e-mails a 
              month. Combined, 117 million constituent e-mails flooded Capitol 
              Hill in 2001. An August 2002 update found this year's House volume 
              is expected to grow 2.5 percent, with Senate volume increasing 24 
              percent.<BR>
              <BR>
              Politicians have taken note. Despite initial burdens on congressional 
              staff, legislators adapted to online activism. House and Senate 
              sites are updating Web pages that allow visitors to post comments 
              rather than e-mail specific accounts.<BR>
              <BR>
              However, the biggest problem groups must solve is how to avoid relying 
              on the Internet as a sole means for activism.<BR>
              <BR>
              "It's a question of disciplining ourselves," said Medea Benjamin, 
              spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Global Exchange peace coalition. 
              "It's easy to spend your whole day responding to people, reading 
              articles, and in the end feel like you haven't done very much."<BR>
              <BR>
              And no matter how much e-presence grass-roots movements possess, 
              it remains difficult to spread their messages to passive observers. 
              Unlike mass media, the Web caters to those people who seek specific 
              information.<BR>
              <BR>
              "I don't think the Internet creates politically active people," 
              said Ed Schwartz, founder of the Philadelphia-based Institute for 
              the Study of Civic Values. "Why would someone who hates politics 
              on television seek it out on the Internet? If you can start to get 
              people interested in the connection between their lives and government, 
              the Internet becomes a great resource to show how those connections 
              are made."
