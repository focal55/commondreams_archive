<p> The world's first permanent war crimes tribunal officially opened its doors in The Hague to bring to justice perpetrators of the worst crimes against humanity as the United States stepped up its opposition to the court.</p>
<p>Four members of an advance team reported to work at a temporary office of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the outskirts of The Hague early on Monday and were ready to receive the first claims, Dutch foreign ministry spokesman Frank de Bruin told AFP on Monday.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called the creation of the ICC, supported now by 74 states, "an historic occasion." </p>
<p>"It holds the promise of a world in which the perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are prosecuted when individual states are unable or unwilling to bring them to justice," Annan said in New York on Sunday.</p>
<p>But the United States along with China, Russia, India and Israel oppose the court, arguing that its citizens could be the targets of politically motivated prosecutions.</p>
<p>Human rights campaigners fear that US opposition to the court is weakening 
the position of the court especially because Washington has demanded its troops 
be exempt from prosecution. But critics have labeled the US position as a further 
example of selective or politicized justice.</p>
<p>"It would be the launch of a nuclear bomb against the concept of international justice, it would become totally ineffective," Jean-Paul Martoz, a Brussels based spokesman for Human Rights Watch, said.</p>
<p>William Pace, a lobbyist for the creation of the ICC for Amnesty International 
and thousands of other organizations, said the US position that "we should be 
treated one way and the rest of the world can be treated differently" was "untenable".</p>
<p>Stepping up its challenge to the ICC, the United States vetoed the renewal of a UN force in Bosnia on the eve of the court's launch, to protest the UN Security Council's refusal to exempt peacekeepers from ICC prosecution.</p>
<p>The US veto, its 75th since the United Nations was set up in 1945, was the latest move in a clash of wills between the United States and advocates of the ICC -- most of them the world's leading democracies. </p>
<p>One of Washington's leading allies in Europe, Britain, called on the United States Monday to sign up to the ICC but at the same time praised the US record in peacekeeping missions.</p>
<p>At NATO headquarters in Brussels, talks were to get under way to discuss the 
future of entire NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia (SFOR) before a Wednesday 
midnight deadline over the fate of the police force.</p>
<p>The US ambassador in Sarajevo meanwhile insisted that US troops serving with SFOR would stay in the country despite the row over the ICC.</p>
<p>"Our strategic commitment to the Balkans and to Bosnia remains rock solid. US troops will remain in Bosnia" as part of the 19,000-strong force, Clifford Bond told journalists.</p>
<p>While human rights groups, the United Nations and many governments have hailed the ICC as a milestone in international justice, the official opening in The Hague was held without ceremonies.</p>
<p>When reached by AFP, the advance team of the court would not give details about the number of calls they had received or say if any complaints had yet been lodged.</p>
<p>The ICC is mandated to prosecute genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression committed anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The court was established by the 1998 Rome Statute when 120 states adopted the statute. </p>
<p>It was agreed the ICC would come into being two calendar months after 60 nations ratified the treaty, which happened on April 11 this year.</p>
<p>The court is not operational yet: there are currently no judges, no prosecutors, no courtrooms and no budget.</p>
<p>In September all 74 states that ratified the Rome treaty will meet in New York to agree on a budget and establish the procedures for electing and appointing court officials and employees.</p>
<p>In January 2003, the chief prosecutor and 18 judges will be elected. The court is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2003.</p>
<p>Although some observers expect complaints to pour in in the first weeks of 
the ICC's existence, the court is not retroactive and can only try crimes committed 
after July 1.</p>
