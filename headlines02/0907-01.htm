<p>PRESIDENT BUSH and Tony Blair ran into a wall of international opposition to 
their proposed military action against Iraq yesterday, after world leaders from 
Paris to Moscow and Beijing urged them to shelve their plans.

</table></font>On the eve of the Prime Minister’s trip to Camp David for talks with Mr Bush, 
President Putin of Russia led a diplomatic counter-attack. Mr Bush and Mr Blair 
telephoned the leaders of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council 
to convince them of the need for action against Iraq. 
<P>But the tactic appeared to backfire when Mr Putin told both men that their 
strategy was wrong and potentially disastrous. “In the course of the discussions, 
the President expressed his serious doubts concerning the basis — both in international 
law, and the global-political sense — of using force against Iraq,” a Kremlin 
spokesman said. Mr Blair, who will visit Russia next month, was warned of the 
“serious, negative consequences for the situation in the Gulf region, the Middle 
East and for the future of the US-led anti-terrorism coalition”. 
<P>The Russians were also very concerned about Thursday night’s air raid by British 
and US aircraft against an Iraqi air defense command post 240 miles west of Baghdad, 
the latest in a series of strikes. 
<P>Mr Bush and Mr Blair also spoke to President Chirac, who emphasized his view 
that military action could be sanctioned only by the UN Security Council. M Chirac 
said it was up to the UN, and not the US alone, to decide how to act against Baghdad 
if Saddam rejected the return of weapons inspectors. The US President met with 
a similar response when he telephoned Jiang Zemin, the Chinese leader, who echoed 
M Chirac’s sentiments. 
<P>The growing resistance to the Anglo-American push for action is likely to come 
to a head next week when Mr Bush makes his case before world leaders at the UN 
General Assembly in New York. 
<P>However, evidence emerged yesterday in support of Washington and London’s contention 
that Iraq is developing weapons of mass destruction. UN experts said recent satellite 
photographs revealed new construction at sites linked to Baghdad’s development 
of nuclear weapons. “We see changes on the ground,” Mark Gwozdecky of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear monitoring body, said. “But until you get 
inspectors on the ground you cannot tell what the purpose of the construction 
is.” </P>
<P>Mr Bush’s spokesman described the pictures as deeply troubling. The evidence 
is likely to be added to information which Mr Bush and Mr Blair are preparing 
to make public. 
<P>The two will swap notes to ensure that when Mr Blair publishes the Government’s 
dossier against Saddam, it is in line with Washington’s information. A similar 
campaign was launched last year to convince world opinion that Osama bin Laden 
was responsible for the September 11 attacks and to justify the military campaign 
in Afghanistan. 
<P>Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, said yesterday that patience with Saddam 
was running out and that military action had to remain an option. 
<P>“Until Saddam co-operates fully with UN weapons inspectors, we have no guarantees 
that a dictator who has previously shown no restraint in using weapons of mass 
destruction will not use them again.”</P>
