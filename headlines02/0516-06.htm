<p>WOODY ALLEN’S decision to launch his new film at the Cannes Film Festival instead of Venice had been hailed as something of a coup by the organizers.
<P>They got more than they bargained for yesterday when the American actor-director stepped into the fierce controversy engendered by a wave of anti-Semitism in France. The 67-year-old Oscar winner, who is a Jew, suggested that a call by the American Jewish Congress to boycott the festival was akin to tactics used by the Nazis. 
<P>“I think any boycott is wrong,” Allen told RTL French radio. “Boycotts were exactly what the Germans were doing against the Jews.” The comment is likely to inflame a row over anti-Semitism that has set France at loggerheads with the Israeli Government and much of Washington’s political establishment. 
<P>In 2000 the French Human Rights Commission reported 116 violent anti-Semitic acts, compared with nine in 1999 and one in 1998. A more recent study said that there had been 405 such incidents between September 2000 and January 2002, and 360 since the start of this year. 
<P>Allen, in France to open the 55th film festival in the Riviera resort, and to promote <I>Hollywood Ending</I>, has found himself cast in the role of defender of French honor.
<P>“France is not anti-Semitic,” he told a press conference. He denounced as ridiculous an advertisement placed in Los Angeles newspapers by the city’s chapter of the American Jewish Congress, which compared contemporary France to the Vichy regime that collaborated with Hitler’s Germany. 
<P>“I don’t think a boycott is in order,” he said. “I just don’t feel it’s right . . . I’ve never felt the French people were in any way anti-Semitic. I know a number of French Jewish people who live in France and they certainly do not feel that way. The French can be very proud of the way they responded in the last election. The country came out with a clear-cut statement of how they felt about the extreme Right, intolerance and discrimination.” 
<P>That Allen has, for his own reasons, always boycotted the festival in the past was not quite the point. He said that he had decided to come to Cannes for the first time because the French had been so appreciative of his films for so long. “I wanted to show some gratitude for years of support,” he said. 
<P>Allen received a standing ovation before the screening of <I>Hollywood Ending</I> last night. He did not watch the film, saying that he did not like seeing himself on screen. “I’m going to have something to eat,” he told the audience. 
<P>“If any of you are still left when I get back, we can talk then.” He returned as the film ended to another ovation. 
<P>There was an angry reaction to his remarks in Los Angeles. Gary Ratner, executive director of the Jewish Congress’s Pacific Southwest chapter, who placed the advertisements, said: “Woody Allen’s comparison of our proposed boycott to what the Nazis did to the Jews is outrageous. 
<P>“We would have hoped that instead of attacking us he would have called on the French Government to do more to fulfill its duty to protect French Jewry. 
<P>“A lot of those being arrested for desecrating synagogues are being charged with the wrong kinds of crimes, crimes like simple vandalism. The Government should openly condemn it as anti-Semitism.” 
<P>He did not accept the defense that most of the attacks appeared to have been carried out by Muslim immigrants. “Are they French or not? If so, why do they keep referring to them as Muslims not French?” The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent New York-based Jewish group, sided with Mr Allen. “We don’t support boycotts,” a spokesman said. “We have many issues with the French, but we have never supported boycotts for the same reasons as Woody Allen. The Jews have suffered from them for centuries.” 
<P>Allen’s remarks came after a row last weekend between President Chirac and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister. M Chirac telephoned Mr Sharon to complain of the “unacceptable” anti-French campaign being waged in Jerusalem. M Chirac is said to be furious at comments by Mr Sharon, who called on French Jews to emigrate. 
<P>Paris is particularly concerned at the connection being made in Israel, as well as America, between the present spate of anti-Semitic incidents and the 17.2 per cent polled in last month’s presidential election by the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen. French officials point out that although M Le Pen’s Front National openly defends the Vichy collaborationists, there is little evidence of its involvement in the recent attacks on Jews. 
<P>These were almost invariably perpetrated by youths from among the five million or so Muslims in France. Mostly the children of immigrants from North Africa, they identify with “their Palestinian brothers” and say that they want to import the intifada. 
<P>This month 99 US senators signed a letter calling on President Bush to put pressure on Governments in Europe, and notably in France, to do more to tackle anti-Semitism. 
<P>Mr Bush is said by his aides to have addressed the issue in private conversations with M Chirac. In a recent speech the US President said: “We reject the ancient evil of anti-Semitism whether it is practiced by the killers of Daniel Pearl (the US journalist) or by those who burn synagogues in France.” 
<P>Jack Rosen, president of the American Jewish Congress, said yesterday: “How come Muslims are attacking Jews in France on a far greater scale than in other countries? What is it in French culture that allows this? We are calling on artists going to Cannes to speak out against this or to stay at home.”
