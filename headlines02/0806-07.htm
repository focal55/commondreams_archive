<p>LUSAKA, ZAMBIA – Under a grass-thatched shelter just off the main road that 
heads east from Lusaka, Josephine Musopelo waits with neighbors for the return 
of her husband. Two days ago, he left for Zambia's capital city, some 35 miles 
away, in search of food for his hungry village. 
<p>People here remember the yellow corn distributed seven years ago during the 
area's last major drought, and Mrs. Musopelo's husband has gone to find its source. 
In Southern Africa, where most people eat white corn, the yellow variety is considered 
animal feed, not fit for human consumption. But Musopelo is desperate. 
<P>"If we eat this pitiful stuff," she says, gesturing at a bag of small fruits 
the family has been pounding into mash for the children, "we will eat anything."</P>
<P>But will they eat genetically modified (GM) corn? That's the question her country's 
leaders are hotly debating as a shipment, partially filled with GM corn, sits 
1,000 miles away in a South African port.</P>
<P>Until now, the scientific debate over the risks, and benefits, of GM foods 
was something fought over largely in the streets of Paris and the dinner tables 
of Iowa. Suddenly, it is a life and death decision for ordinary Zambians, and 
it threatens to derail international efforts to avert a famine in Southern Africa. 
The governments of countries like Zambia find themselves in the difficult position 
of either accepting a technology into their country before they have determined 
if it's safe, or turning away grain that could save lives now.</P>
<P>The US has offered to provide half of what Zambia needs to feed those who are 
hungry , and one-third of what is needed regionally. At least some of that is 
corn that has been genetically modified.</P>
<P>Although none of the seven African countries targeted for emergency food aid 
has officially said they will reject American aid, at least one shipment of food 
has already been diverted from Zimbabwe, in part due to GM concerns. Several other 
countries are seriously considering turning away the food. Zambia's president, 
Levy Manawasa, said last week that despite its need, his country would not accept 
American food aid if it cannot be proven safe.</P>
<P>People have been selectively breeding crops for thousands of years to improve 
yields or adapt plants to new environments. New technology now allows the genes 
from one organism to be inserted into another.</P>
<P>But the technology is controversial. Some scientists, particularly in Europe, 
worry that GM food could cause allergic reactions in humans or that it could pollute 
the environment by cross pollinating with natural varieties. Others say it could 
provide the solution to feeding the world's hungry by making plants that are drought 
and pest resistant.</P>
<P>On the streets of Lusaka, where much of the debate is fueled by misinformation 
and public hysteria, people are primarily concerned about whether the food will 
make them sick.</P>
<P>In a poor rural settlement on the outskirts of Lusaka, George Chilumbo is skeptical 
of the help pouring in for the estimated 2.3 million people in Zambia, and more 
than 12 million regionally, tottering on the edge of starvation. Mr. Chilumbo 
doesn't understand the details of genetic modification. All he knows is that some 
people think the food could be dangerous.</P>
<P>"We think that if we eat that food, bad things could happen to us, like cancers 
could grow in our stomachs," he says, to the nods of his friends. "I would rather 
starve than eat that food."</P>
<P>Since there is thus far no evidence that GM foods have a harmful effect on 
people, and Americans have been eating it for some time, those fears are likely 
to be superceded by the immediate need for food.</P>
<P>"What I personally find so disturbing about this whole GM debate is the fact 
that we've been eating it for the past five years," says Allan Reed, director 
of the United States Agency for International Development in Zambia. "For someone 
to say that this food is being dumped, or that it has been rejected by the United 
States, is simply not true."</P>
<P>Even before the aid debate put genetic modification in the headlines, farmers 
here have been bitterly divided over the issue. Some, like those in the cotton 
industry, say its introduction is necessary to keep them competitive in the international 
market. Others in the country's growing organic export market worry that allowing 
GM crops into the country could close the European Union (EU) market to them. 
They fear that GM crops will either mix with their own or, at the very least, 
hurt their image among anti-GM European consumers.</P>
<P>"You can understand the Zambian officials' concern because on one hand donors 
and others are telling them, 'Look, you've got to improve your agriculture by 
going for niche markets like the organic market,'" says Rob Tripp, a researcher 
at the Overseas Development Institute. "On the other hand there's a real fear 
that they could get cut out of these markets in places like the EU, which are 
creating increasingly strict GM regulations."</P>
<P>Lovemore Simwanda, who is leading the investigations into GM food for the Zambian 
National Farmers Union, worries the food shortage is forcing the country to make 
a decision on GM too quickly and without the proper information.</P>
<P>"The American government wants to push us into accepting this," he says. "They 
think we've got hunger and that we're going to be forced into accepting their 
food and ultimately GM."</P>
<P>One potential short-term solution is to mill the corn before distribution, 
since one of the main concerns in Zambia is that seed intended as food aid will 
be hoarded and planted next year, potentially affecting local maize crops with 
GM strains.</P>
<P>Namibia has milled grain for several years due to GM concerns. But such a solution 
is expensive &#150; as much as $25 per metric ton &#150; and could cause delays 
in getting the food to people already living on the edge. Additionally, some United 
Nations officials privately say such a move is opposed by the United States which 
fears such a compromise implicitly acknowledges a problem with the food.</P>
<P>Even if it is not milled, the American aid poses little threat to Zambia's 
crops, say experts. American corn is specifically bred for the conditions in the 
Midwest and is unlikely to thrive in Zambia. Many experts say GM corn is likely 
already present in Zambia since South Africa is one of the largest producers of 
GM food in the world and a major trade partner with Zambia.</P>
<P>The GM debate hasn't yet filtered down the road towards Malawi where Mrs. Musopelo 
and her neighbors are waiting for help. They don't understand what a gene is or 
how parts of one plant can be inserted into another. There are no words in their 
language for such technologies. All they knows is that their families are hungry.</P>
<P>"Our survival depends on help from outside," says Mrs. Musopelo's neighbor, 
Michael Simwinga. "If you don't assist us, our children and ourselves will die."</p>
