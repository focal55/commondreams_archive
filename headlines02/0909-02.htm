<p>In the countdown to Wednesday's anniversary of Sept. 11, the growing U.S. drumbeat 
for war was met with protests and vigils in Marin County and Oakland Sunday as

Remembering the victims of last year's attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, 
participants condemned not only the attacks but also U.S. plans for a possible 
attack on Iraq, secret detentions by the U.S. government and U.S.-led bombings 
of Afghanistan. 
<P>More than 2,000 people chanted peace slogans and joined hands to form a human 
chain along major boulevards in Marin County to urge American leaders to show 
restraint in Iraq. 
<P>Passing motorists waved, flashed peace signs and honked their horns in solidarity 
with demonstrators on Third Street and the Miracle Mile in San Rafael and San 
Anselmo. Others carried placards with signs such as "Love America, Care for the 
World." A dozen drummers pounded out a mesmerizing beat. 
<P>In Oakland, nearly 250 people with anti-war signs marched halfway around Lake 
Merritt and attended a memorial gathering with East Bay Muslims at the Islamic 
Cultural Center of Northern California.

The colorful procession featured flags of the Earth, Ecumenical Peace Institute 
members singing "Dona Nobis Pacem" (Grant Us Peace), a banner with a war-resistance 
pledge by the "Not in Our Name" group, and many marchers wearing tags bearing 
names of people held in secret detention after Sept. 11. 
<P>"War is not the answer to the problems we face right now. We need to look for 
alternatives," said Devi Peri of the Marin Peace and Justice Coalition, which 
was formed one week after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
<P>"We're going in the wrong direction. Violence creates more violence, and hatred 
creates more hatred," said Jo Button-Tait of Mill Valley, who held a peace sign 
along Third Street in San Rafael. "Thank God we live in a country where we can 
do this." 
<P>The Oakland march began with Moina Noor, director of American Muslims Intent 
on Learning and Activism, condemning the Sept. 11 attacks as "an act of criminal 
and brutal aggression against our nation." The attacks also amounted to "the hijacking 
of our religion in the name of God, Islam and Muhammad, our beloved prophet." 
<P>Carolyn Scarr, a Berkeley Methodist and board member of the Ecumenical Peace 
Institute, said America is "facing a civil liberties disaster," referring to the 
arrests of suspects and their secret detention. 
<P>"There are hundreds of them," she said. "They've just been scooped up and taken 
away. Nobody knows where they are. It's just like Argentina." She wore a name 
tag saying, "Nacer Mustafa, 29, Palestinian, Disappeared in the U.S." 
<P>An American Muslim man, Oakland locksmith Carlos Ali, wore a sandwich board 
saying, "Our grief is not a cry for war," a message displayed on several other 
signs, stickers and leaflets. 
<P>The demonstrators in Marin grew silent shortly before 3 p.m. and held hands, 
as one organizer described it, to "sense our connection with the whole world. 
" The marchers later gathered in San Rafael's downtown plaza for a peace rally 
with music and a "free speech" soapbox. 
<P>The peace marchers gathered to mourn the victims of Sept. 11, but also to grieve 
the deaths of civilians in Afghanistan who were killed by the U.S. bombing campaign 
there. 
<P>"As the current administration prepares for a war against Iraq, our banners 
rise to oppose war and say yes to a just and peaceful world," the group said in 
a written statement. 
<P>Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson praised the gathering at the Islamic 
Cultural Center, saying, "Thank you for stepping forth and boldly saying, 'We 
too want to remember what has taken place and what is currently taking place around 
this world.' " 
<P>Nearly 20 groups co-sponsored the Oakland event, including United Muslims of 
America, Berkeley Interfaith Women for Peace, A Jewish Voice for Peace, California 
Peace Action, the San Francisco Bay chapter of the National Lawyers Guild and 
Global Exchange. 
<P>A featured speaker was Kelly Campbell of Oakland, founding member of the Peaceful 
Tomorrows advocacy group of families of Sept. 11 victims. One of the victims was 
Craig Amundson, brother of Campbell's partner, Barry. 
<P>"We don't want other people killed in response to Craig's death," she said. 
"We don't want other families in the world to suffer."</p>
