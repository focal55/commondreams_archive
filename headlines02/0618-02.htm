<p>Ted Turner, the billionaire founder of CNN, accuses Israel today of engaging 
in "terrorism" against the Palestinians, in comments that threaten to lead to 
a further decline in the news network's already poor relations with the Jewish 
state. 
<P>"Aren't the Israelis and the Palestinians both terrorizing each other?" says 
Turner, who is vice-chairman of AOL Time Warner, which owns CNN, in an exclusive 
interview with the Guardian. 
<P>"The Palestinians are fighting with human suicide bombers, that's all they 
have. The Israelis ... they've got one of the most powerful military machines 
in the world. The Palestinians have nothing. So who are the terrorists? I would 
make a case that both sides are involved in terrorism." 
<P>His remarks were last night condemned by Ariel Sharon's government, which called 
them "stupid". Andrea Levin, director of the American pro-Israeli media watchdog 
Camera, said the comments were a "reprehensible" attempt to "blur the line between 
perpetrator and victim". 
<P>In his first British interview since the September 11 attacks, Mr Turner - 
who broke philanthropic records in 1997 when he donated $1bn to the UN - argues 
that poverty and desperation are the root cause of Palestinian suicide bombings. 
<P>But Daniel Seaman, a spokesman for the Israeli government, said: "My only advice 
to Ted Turner is if people assume you are stupid, it is just best to keep your 
mouth shut rather than open your mouth and confirm everyone in that view." 
<P>Mr Turner also admits that he was wrong to call the September 11 hijackers 
"brave" in a speech in Rhode Island that sparked outrage. "I made an unfortunate 
choice of words," he says, adding that his ownership of the Atlanta Braves baseball 
team meant the word was never far from his mind. "Look, I'm a very good thinker, 
but I sometimes grab the wrong word ... I mean, I don't type my speeches, then 
sit up there and read them off the teleprompter, you know. I wing it." 
<P>Mr Turner is moved to tears at one point in the interview by the "depressing" 
combination of conflicts like that in the Middle East and the state of the environment, 
which he says demands massive global attention - "or, you know ... it's goodbye". 
<P>A senior minister in Yasser Arafat's cabinet told the Guardian he welcomed 
Mr Turner's comments. Many Palestinians complain just as bitterly of a pro-Israeli 
bias in CNN's coverage - mocking it as the "Zionist News Network" - as Israel 
complains of a pro-Palestinian one. 
<P>"I feel it reflects a more consistent approach," said Ghassan Khatib, Mr Arafat's 
newly appointed labor minister and until recently director of the Jerusalem Media 
and Communications Center, a Palestinian media monitoring unit. 
<P>"One of the problems in trying to reduce the violence has been the focus of 
so much international attention on Israeli rather than Palestinian civilian deaths, 
although four times as many Palestinians have been killed." 
<P>CNN has been a punchbag for both sides. A widespread perception of bias among 
some Israelis and US supporters of Israel has prompted several boycotts by pressure 
groups, urging viewers to switch to Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel. But three 
months ago, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mr Arafat slammed 
down the phone after accusing her of anti-Palestinian bias. "You are covering 
with these questions the terrorist activities of the Israeli occupation and the 
Israeli crimes," he said. "Be quiet. Be fair. Thank you, bye-bye."</p>
