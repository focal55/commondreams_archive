In a sign of growing opposition in the academic world to potential war with Iraq, 
more than 1,000 students and professors at local colleges spoke out yesterday 
at rallies, panels, and marches, vowing to step up opposition to a preemptive 
strike against Iraq. 
<P> ''Striking first at Iraq would be both a moral outrage and a violation of 
international law,'' Nancy Kanwisher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
professor, told a crowd of about 200 protesters at Harvard University. ''It would 
be the best possible way to produce more hatred of America and increase the likelihood 
of terrorism.'' 
<P> Yesterday's gatherings at Harvard, Tufts, and Boston universities, as well 
as Emerson and Boston colleges took place on the first anniversary of the start 
of US bombing in Afghanistan. They also followed Sunday's gatherings across the 
nation of tens of thousands of protesters organized by Not In Our Name, a grass-roots 
group that includes several Hollywood celebrities. Also, they preceded last night's 
televised address to the nation by President Bush outlining his policy on Iraq. 
<P> ''This is not a onetime protest registering our moral objection to war,'' 
said Joe Ramsey, a Tufts University graduate student who organized a rally and 
march that attracted about 170 people. ''This is a process.'' 
<P> The demonstrations, involving many students and professors who did not oppose 
toppling the Taliban, suggest that the Bush administration may find it far harder 
to build public support for war against Iraq. 
<P> ''This is a much clearer case than Afghanistan,'' said Kanwisher, a professor 
of cognitive and brain science who did not participate in last year's protests. 
<P> In the past two weeks, more than 9,500 faculty members at universities across 
the country have signed an open letter opposing the war, according to Kanwisher 
and the Web site www.noiraqattack.org, which has sprung up in recent weeks along 
with www.nowaroniraq.org. Another Web site, www.nowarnoway.org, which is run by 
the student activist group Boston Mobilization, helped coordinate yesterday's 
protests on campuses around the country. 
<P> ''Groups that were not sure about the war in Afghanistan are sure about this 
war,'' said Shelby Meyerhoff, a Harvard senior. ''It's much more an academic community 
coming together.'' 
<P> At Harvard, silver-haired couples in expensive coats stood next to students 
who beat on pots and pans and carried signs saying ''Earth to Bush - We don't 
want war.'' At Tufts, pickets passed out fliers that stated ''no credible evidence 
has been presented that Iraq had anything to do with the Sept. 11 attacks.'' 
<P> At Boston University, students hung colorful cutouts representing Iraqis allegedly 
killed by US sanctions and bombings. At BU's School of Law, about 140 listened 
to professors Ward Farnsworth and Daniel Partan debate the legal issues involved 
in striking first at Iraq. 
<P> About 100 students gathered at Boston College, where they said protests are 
rare, to listen to Jesuit priests speaking out against military aggression. </p>
