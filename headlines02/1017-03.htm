<p> BEIRUT -- French President Jacques Chirac made his strongest statement yet 
against a military strike on Iraq, saying yesterday that &#34;war is the worst 
solution&#34; and that &#34;everything must be done to avoid it.&#34;</P>
<P>Mr. Chirac spoke in Alexandria, Egypt, as he made his way to a summit of francophone 
countries in Beirut.</P>
<P>The francophone summit is usually a mainly cultural event, but it has taken 
on a political coloration this year because of its Middle Eastern venue and the 
presence of Mr. Chirac.</P>
<P>France has been resisting U.S. efforts to have the United Nations Security 
Council permit an attack on Iraq if Baghdad does not comply fully with UN weapons 
inspections.</P>
<P>&#34;Our American friends would like this same resolution to authorize the 
international community, if one believes the Iraqi authorities are not doing what 
is necessary, to intervene militarily,&#34; Mr. Chirac said after a meeting with 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</P>
<P>&#34;I have always thought that war is the worst solution. Everything must 
be done to avoid it,&#34; he added.</P>
<P>France is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and can therefore exercise 
a veto on any proposed resolution, and U.S. officials have been growing increasingly 
frustrated with French unwillingness to authorize force. Yesterday, Mr. Chirac 
hinted strongly that France would veto any resolution that seemed likely to lead 
to war.</P>
<P>&#34;The region does not need another war if we can avoid it,&#34; he said.</P>
<P>Although cultural issues still dominate the official agenda of the francophone 
summit, bilateral discussions among the more than 50 leaders attending the summit 
will be dominated by the situation in the Middle East.</P>
<P>Earlier this week, Mr. Chirac also disputed the American position that there 
is a link between the al-Qaeda terrorist network and the Iraqi regime.</P>
<P>In an interview with a Beirut newspaper in advance of the summit, the French 
leader said &#34;no proof had been found&#34; of a connection.</P>
<P>Officials from Canada, the Francophonie's second major sponsor, said Prime 
Minister Jean Chr&#233;tien agrees with that view.</P>
<P>In the past, Mr. Chr&#233;tien's position on a military strike against Iraq 
has been more ambivalent than that of Mr. Chirac. But at this week's summit, he 
may be inclined to distance himself from the United States. Canada's ambassador 
to Lebanon, Michel Duval, told the English-language Daily Star newspaper that 
Ottawa &#34;believes force can achieve very little,&#34; and that it does not 
regard a military strike as a &#34;solution to the current crisis.&#34;</P>
<P>The push to disarm Iraq, using military force if necessary, has been described 
by some of its critics as a coalition of English-speaking countries, since the 
most enthusiastic supporters of the action have been the United States, Britain 
and Australia.</P>
<P>The Francophonie is probably too diverse a group to develop a common policy 
on the crisis. The organization includes members from Europe, the Middle East, 
Asia and North and South America, including more than 50 former colonies.</P>
<P>In Lebanon, which bid to host the summit three years ago in order to showcase 
the country's emergence from decades of civil war and foreign occupation, a number 
of political factions have welcomed it as a counterweight to U.S. regional policy.</P>
<P>That even includes the militant Islamist group Hezbollah, which Washington 
has branded a terrorist organization.</P>
