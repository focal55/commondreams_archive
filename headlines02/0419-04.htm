Eight Americans, most from the Bay Area, who tried to reach the Palestinian territories 
this week to act as "human shields" were turned away at the Tel Aviv airport by 
Israeli officials, relatives and friends said yesterday. 
<P>The eight had boarded an Air Canada flight Tuesday from San Francisco International 
Airport and were promptly detained by Israeli officials upon touching down early 
Wednesday. 
<P>Stream Weir, daughter of traveler Alison Weir of Sausalito, said her mother 
called to say the group was scheduled to be deported back to the United States 
last night. 
<P>"I'm really upset that they are being held without being told why," Stream 
Weir said. "They weren't going to do anything wrong. They were just going to be 
eyes."

</font>In interviews before they left, the travelers refrained from calling themselves 
pro-Palestinian. But they said they wanted to see firsthand the effects of Israel's 
hunt for terrorists and the military occupation of Palestinian territory. 
<P>They also hoped their presence in Palestinian homes, hospitals and on the streets 
would discourage the Israeli army from attacking those locations for fear of killing 
Americans. 
<P>The trip was well publicized, with Alison Weir giving interviews on radio and 
television, which might explain why Israeli officials were on the lookout for 
them at the airport. 
<P>An official of the U.S. Embassy in Israel confirmed that eight Americans had 
been detained Wednesday. The Israeli Consulate in San Francisco did not return 
calls. 
<P>The group was pulled together by Iman Farajallah of Daly City, who said she 
grew up in a refugee camp in Gaza and still has family there. 
<P>Farajallah, who did not travel along, created the Muslim Grassroots Protection 
Program after Israel began its military assault on suspected terrorists in Palestinian 
towns and villages. She has been recruiting other activists for another trip to 
the Palestinian territories in May. 
<P>"It seems critical that some American citizens be there on the ground to participate 
in nonviolent actions," Alison Weir, 54, said before leaving the Bay Area. "Our 
massive amount of tax money sent to Israel that literally has no strings attached 
. . . is preventing peace from being reached." 
<P>The travelers were an eclectic mix. Weir is a community journalist. Regina 
Carey, 50, of Terra Linda, described as herself as a civil rights activist working 
for a high-tech firm. Others were artists and political activists. 
<P>The travelers received little or no training and had few plans except to meet 
with a peace activist group called International Protection Program for Palestinians, 
also known as the Solidarity Movement. They were told the group would train them 
and shuttle them to Palestinian territories.
