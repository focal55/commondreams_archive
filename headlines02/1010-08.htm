<p>WASHINGTON - Harvard University's financial relationship with President Bush's 
former oil company was deeper than previously understood, with the university's 
management fund creating a separate ''off the books'' partnership with Harken 
Energy Corp. that helped keep afloat the financially troubled company, according 
to a report to be released today. 
<P> <a href="http://www.harvardwatch.org/" target="_new">HarvardWatch</a>, a student-alumni 
group that monitors the school's investments, plans to issue the report and say 
that it has analyzed documents showing that the Harvard fund, an independent entity 
that manages the university's endowment, formed a partnership in 1990 with Bush's 
oil firm called the Harken Anadarko Partnership. The partnership effectively removed 
$20 million of debt from Harken's books, relieving the Texas company's short-term 
financial problems. 
<P> About the same time, the Harvard fund invested about $30 million in Harken, 
which also helped keep the firm afloat. The partnership has not been mentioned 
in recent accounts of Bush's financial dealings in the oil business. 
<P> William K. Black, a former federal banking regulator, said in a telephone 
interview that he has examined the Harken Anadarko Partnership and concluded the 
arrangement was a significant expansion of the Harvard fund's involvement in the 
company beyond the $30 million investment. 
<P> ''Harvard had a dramatically larger financial stake and a much more interesting 
financial stake'' than was previously understood, Black said. ''It all serves 
as a partnership device to move money from Harvard to Harken. This is beyond nuts 
from an institutional investor's standpoint.'' 
<P> The creation of the partnership was approved in a motion made by Bush, who 
was on the Harken board of directors and its audit committee, said Black, an assistant 
professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Austin. 
<P> White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the idea of the partnership came 
from the Harvard fund. 
<P> ''This is something that Harvard proposed, and Harvard set the terms of the 
partnership,'' McClellan said yesterday. ''Harvard proposed the partnership because 
Harvard decided it wanted to get more involved in the energy sector and be more 
directly involved in operational aspects.'' 
<P> Representatives of Harvard Management and Houston-based Harken Energy did 
not return phone calls seeking comment on the partnership. 
<P> In May 1990, Black said, the Harvard fund and another unnamed shareholder 
loaned Harken a total of $46 million. But with Harken still having a debt load, 
the fund and Harken formed the Harken Anadarko Partnership in December 1990. The 
partnership was ''off the Harken books,'' Black said, which he said means that 
Harken's stake in the partnership was reported but the financial details did not 
need to be revealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
<P> Such a partnership was legal, he said. 
<P> According to Black, the partnership was set up to help Harken avoid bankruptcy 
and included $64.5 million worth of unrelated energy properties owned by the Harvard 
fund and $26 million of drilling operations from Harken - along with $20 million 
worth of Harken's debt and liabilities. Harken held a 16 percent stake in the 
partnership while the Harvard fund owned 84 percent, according to HarvardWatch. 
Nonetheless, the operation was run by Harken, which was paid $1 million per year 
to operate the partnership's oil and gas ventures, the report said. 
<P> Harken ''transferred an enormous amount of liabilities to the partnership,'' 
Black said. ''You don't see the Harvards of the world doing things like this.'' 
<P> With so much debt removed from Harken's own books, Harken's stock price rose 
and the Harvard fund sold 1.6 million shares during this temporary stock bubble, 
the report says. 
<P> The formation of the partnership, coupled with the fund's purchase of Harken 
stock, kept the firm afloat financially, according to Black. Black's review of 
the partnership may add weight to the findings of HarvardWatch. 
<P> Black, a registered Democrat, is a well-known specialist in reviewing financial 
transactions; he was the deputy director of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp. during the Reagan and first Bush administrations and played a key role in 
investigating the ''Keating Five'' scandal that involved five senators. Black 
also played a role in the investigation that helped lead to the resignation of 
House Speaker Jim Wright, a Democrat. He said he has conducted financial reviews 
that make him unpopular among Democrats and said he did not examine the Harken 
partnership for political reasons. 
<P> It was 1986 when George W. Bush's struggling oil venture, Spectrum 7, was 
purchased by Harken. Harken gave Bush a seat on the board of directors and an 
annual paycheck of $120,000. At the time, Bush's father, George H. W. Bush, was 
vice president. It was around this same time that the Harvard fund began investing 
in Harken. The fund eventually poured $30 million into Harken and became the largest 
shareholder. A Harvard Management official, Michael Eisenson, was given a seat 
on the Harken board.
