<p>KABUL, Afghanistan - President Mohammad Khatami, paying the first visit to 
Afghanistan by an Iranian head of state in 40 years, accused the United States 
on Tuesday of pursuing an "angry approach" to foreign policy since the attacks 
of Sept. 11. 
<p> Khatami, speaking at a press conference with U.S.-backed Afghan President 
Hamid Karzai, promised to help rebuild this country and said the only justification 
for any foreign presence in Afghanistan was to bring peace after nearly a generation 
of war. 
<p> "The American administration has a misunderstanding about their own power 
and their own interests," Khatami said. "Since Sept. 11, this administration has 
taken an angry approach to foreign policy." 
<p> Khatami did not offer specific examples, nor did he cite U.S. threats to force 
the ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, with whom Iran fought a long war 
in the 1980s. 
<p> "No doubt attacking one state in the world affects other states," Khatami 
said. "Today, we know that aggression brings aggression and to believe that you 
can make people submit by force is wrong. We know it actually brings anger and 
destruction." 
<p> "Those with power have more responsibility to bring peace in the world," Khatami 
added. "No country should use the fight against terrorism to force their views 
on other countries." 
<p> Karzai, whose government depends heavily on the United States for its very 
survival, was careful to avoid taking sides. "We are grateful to Iran for accepting 
our refugees and we thank America for their help in fighting the terrorists, for 
help in establishing the transitional government," Karzai said. 
<p> Khatami was welcomed at Kabul airport by Karzai, who rode with his Iranian 
guest to the presidential palace under heavy American and Iranian security. The 
two leaders were accompanied by Herat warlord Ismail Khan, whose close ties to 
Iran have worried both Karzai and his American backers. 
<p> "We are hopeful for a brighter future for Afghanistan," Khatami said in a 
speech to the Afghan people shortly after arriving at the palace. "I have warm 
gratitude and special respect for you, dear people of Afghanistan." 
<p> During his press conference, Khatami said Iran has offered 2,000 university 
scholarships to Afghan students and that 6,000 Afghans had expressed an interest 
in studying there. Khatami said efforts were under way to boost trade between 
the two countries and that Iran hoped to rebuild the rail link between Herat and 
the Iranian border. 
<p> "The international community should accept responsibility to help the government 
to start rebuilding and bring stability to this country," Khatami said. 
<p> Last week the Iranian parliament approved $500 million in reconstruction aid 
for war-shattered Afghanistan. Iran also recently handed over 16 suspected al-Qaida 
fighters to Saudi Arabia at that country's request. 
<p> Khatami's entourage also included Iranian police officials who planned discussions 
on how to stem opium production and trafficking in Afghanistan. 
<p> By the late 1990s, Afghanistan had become by far the world's largest producer 
of opium, the raw material of heroin. In 2000, the Taliban government imposed 
an effective ban on opium production but the U.S.-led overthrow of the former 
government has spurred the planting and harvesting of opium poppies again in the 
country. 
<p> The Iranian news agency said the visit was the first to Afghanistan by an 
Iranian head of state since 1962, when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi visited Kabul 
in a failed attempt to mediate a dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
<p> The high-level visit and the promise of aid underscore Iran's interest in 
reaching out to neighboring Afghanistan, which shares close ties of language, 
Islamic faith and culture, at a time when this country's government is heavily 
dependent on the United States. 
<p> Iran was not on good terms with the Taliban when they ruled Afghanistan and 
sheltered hundreds of thousands of refugees. The Iranians publicly endorsed the 
U.S.-led fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida and cooperated with the United 
States in trying to limit the spread of narcotics from Afghanistan. 
<p> Still, Iran remains one of the countries President Bush has identified as 
belonging to the "axis of evil" that threatens global stability. Earlier this 
year, the United States criticized alleged Iranian interference in Afghan affairs 
and accused Tehran of trying to undermine the Karzai government. 
<p> "We have no intention of interfering in this country," Khatami said. "No country 
should interfere in this country because the people of Afghanistan would never 
tolerate that." 
<p> U.S. intelligence officials have also complained that Iran has allowed some 
senior al-Qaida officials shelter or safe passage. Iranian officials have expressed 
concerns about the United States having too much influence over the new government 
in Afghanistan. 
<p> Nevertheless, Iranian and American security agents rode together in the convoy 
that accompanied Khatami from the airport to the palace. Armed Americans stood 
watch on rooftops overlooking the route.
