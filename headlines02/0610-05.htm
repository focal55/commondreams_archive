Clark Kerr, ousted from his job as president of the University of 
California following student protests in the 1960s, says he is greatly 
disturbed by documents revealing that the FBI campaigned to get him fired.
<P>"I always had a high opinion of the FBI, so it came to me as quite a shock 
that they would step outside their boundaries the way they did," Kerr said 
Sunday in an interview at his El Cerrito home. "I think they did me some 
damage."

</table>Kerr gave his first public response to a Chronicle report that revealed 
wide-ranging and unlawful covert operations at the university involving the 
head of the CIA and Gov. Ronald Reagan.
<P>Kerr, 91, a renowned educator who led UC to academic excellence, also said 
that the FBI harmed the integrity of the university by intruding into campus 
affairs and exacerbating internal disputes.
<P>"What bothers me is that the FBI would want to go so far outside its proper 
jurisdiction and get involved in the internal affairs of the university," Kerr 
said.
<P>The Chronicle's report was based on FBI records obtained after a 17-year 
legal battle under the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI refused to turn 
over many records on the grounds that they concerned law enforcement, but five 
federal judges found that many of the FBI's activities were unlawful and 
ordered more than 200,000 pages of the files released.
<P>An FBI spokesman had previously declined to comment on The Chronicle story. 
Edwin Meese III, who was Gov. Reagan's chief of staff, had said that to his 
knowledge the FBI gave Reagan no special help, and the bureau's contacts with 
him were proper.
<P>The documents show that the FBI:
<P>-- Sent the White House a report on Kerr containing allegations that he was 
disloyal -- even though the bureau knew they were false.
<P>-- Schemed with then-CIA Chief John McCone to leak derogatory reports about 
students and faculty to Edwin Pauley, a senior member of the university's 
Board of Regents, who used them in his efforts to oust Kerr.
<P>-- Gave a secret briefing about alleged subversion on campus to Gov. Reagan,
<P>who had vowed to fire Kerr during his 1966 campaign for governor.
<P>Kerr was dismissed by UC's governing Board of Regents on Jan. 20, 1967, at 
the first board meeting attended by the newly elected Reagan.
<P>Kerr acknowledged that by then some regents and Reagan were angry with him 
because of continuing student protests at UC Berkeley.
<P>"Then the FBI came in and added some fuel to the flames," he said. "What 
happened might have happened anyway, but it was more likely with FBI support."
<P>Kerr said the FBI's secretly giving the late regent Pauley reports about 
liberal faculty, students and regents harmed the university's integrity.
<P>"Organizations are based on trust, and when you start passing around 
private, derogatory information, it's destructive of trust," Kerr said in 
other remarks to The Chronicle. "It's harmful to the university to have one 
member of the board be provided derogatory information on others."
<P>Kerr's dismissal followed a series of protests, including the 1964 Free 
Speech Movement, in which Berkeley students challenging the university's ban 
against campus political activity staged the nation's first major college 
protests of the era. The FSM was followed by the "filthy speech movement" and 
anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.
<P>But Hoover and other top FBI officials had been unhappy with Kerr for years.
<P>Soon after Kerr became UC president in 1958, the head of the San Francisco 
FBI office wrote Hoover a memo reporting on a plot by an aide to conservative 
state Sen. Hugh Burns to get Kerr removed from his job. "Dr. Kerr," an FBI 
report on the plan said, "has always given the impression that he is a 
'liberal' in the educational field."
<P>Kerr said he was disturbed by the FBI's apparently having taken sides 
against him because of his political views.
<P>"I think it's despicable," he said. "It's certainly undemocratic. It's the 
kind of thing you would expect more from the intelligence agencies of Russia 
than you would from the U.S."
<P>In early 1960, Hoover became furious over an essay question on UC's English 
aptitude test for high school applicants that asked: "What are the dangers to 
a democracy of a national police organization, like the FBI, which operates 
secretly and is unresponsive to public criticism?"
<P>Hoover blamed Kerr for the question, even though the university president 
had nothing to do with it. The following year, Hoover wrote on a memo to his 
top aides, "I know Kerr is no good."
<P>In those days, when many officials feared that communists had infiltrated 
the U.S. government, such remarks "would have been very damaging," Kerr said.
<P>In December 1964, President Lyndon Johnson was considering Kerr to be his 
secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and requested a routine background 
report on Kerr. A federal court in the FOIA case later found that the FBI used 
the report as a pretext to undermine Kerr. The FBI sent the White House 
allegations that Kerr was disloyal, even though the bureau had investigated 
and found them to be untrue.
<P>"That was damaging to me, not pointing out that it was not true," Kerr said.
<P>"That amazes me," he added. "That was really a very aggressive action, to 
spread it around the government."
<P>After the false FBI report to the White House, and his dismissal as UC 
president in January 1967, Kerr never received another White House appointment.
<P>"All this going on really sort of surprises me," Kerr said. "I shouldn't 
say surprises me. It disturbs me."
<P>Kerr said he was unaware of the FBI's efforts against him until he was 
contacted by The Chronicle.
<P>He had requested his FBI files under the Freedom of Information Act in the 
late 1970s, Kerr said, but an FBI official told him that "they couldn't send 
me anything."
<P>"My guess is," Kerr said, "they were trying to keep it quiet."</p>
