The government should more carefully, and publicly, review the environmental impact of genetically altered plants before approving them and, to detect unforeseen problems, should monitor fields even after such crops are being grown commercially, a panel of biologists and agricultural scientists concluded yesterday.
<P> The panel, convened by the National Academy of Sciences, said the Department of Agriculture had not missed any big environmental risks in its review of genetically modified plants, a step required before the plants can be either field-tested or grown for marketing.</p>

The scientists also emphasized that their findings were intended to "improve an already functioning system," and noted that "the standards being set for transgenic crops are much higher than for their conventional counterparts."
<P> But, they said, biotechnology companies are rapidly developing new plants containing either combinations of genes, or individual genes that induce the plant to produce industrial chemicals, fuels and other materials. These efforts, the panel said, will require much more rigorous testing and review than the government currently undertakes.</p>
<P> Other crop types, produced by nongenetic means, can pose environmental risks as well, the panel said. But it said the public had demanded, and should be granted, an extra level of precaution when organisms are genetically engineered. </p>
<P> The panel's report, a summary of which was described yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, was requested by the Agriculture Department and took two years to produce. It concluded that the testing and assessment of genetically altered plants should be made "significantly more transparent and rigorous," with reviews by independent panels of experts, with more involvement of the public and with less secrecy.</p>
<P> It noted that companies seeking permission to commercialize genetically altered plants in the United States were allowed to keep much more data confidential than in other countries.</p>
<P> Officials of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an Agriculture Department agency that issues permits for genetically modified crops, said the study validated their current program while pointing to areas to improve. Bobby R. Acord, administrator of the inspection service, said the agency was already "considering how best to further encourage public comment and receive broader scientific input."</p>
<P> Companies producing bioengineered crops echoed the agricultural officials, pointing to the report's qualified endorsement of the existing regulatory system. "They make a number of suggestions for enhancing that process, but they make it very clear that a rigorous assessment is being done," said Dr. Eric Sachs, a geneticist who is director of scientific affairs for Monsanto.</p>
<P> Environmental groups said the report could help produce what they described as much-needed improvements in the review process.</p>
<P> "It has been a cakewalk for the industry in terms of getting products approved," said Dr. Margaret Mellon, a molecular biologist and biotechnology expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists. </p>
<P> "The real question raised by this report," Dr. Mellon added, "is whether a rickety system that hasn't been very rigorous but probably has served well enough to date is adequate enough to take us into the future." The answer delivered by the panel, she said, is that the system is not up to the task. </p>
<P> The report noted, for example, that although the Environmental Protection Agency required monitoring of approved crops that have genes for pest-killing toxins, neither that agency nor any other is responsible for monitoring crops with other genetic traits.</p>
<P> The committee also said agricultural officials currently approved most proposed plant varieties for field tests, with no limit on acreage, on the basis of a company's written statements. Much more review is needed, it said, along with involvement by independent scientists and the public.</p>
