<p> VENICE   - After last year's attacks on the United States, President George W. Bush declared "You're either with us or against us". But film directors exploring the world's reaction to September 11 say things are not that black and white.
<p> Almost a year after suicide hijackers killed more than 3,000 people and brought down New York's World Trade Center towers, the Venice Film Festival is abuzz with discussion about "11'09"01 September 11" -- 11 directors' responses to the day America came under attack.

directors from different countries and cultures and eleven views of the tragic 
events that took place in New York on September 11, 2001. This collective movie 
is in competition for the &quot;Special Events&quot; section at the 59th Venice 
Film Festival in Venice, Italy, Thursday, Sept. 5, 2002. This picture is a scene

</table></font>Some of the short films have been accused of anti-Americanism, linking U.S. foreign policy to violence in the Middle East and the 1973 coup in Chile. Others suggest the United States has forgotten pain and poverty elsewhere in the world.
<p> "Voices from across the globe should be heard," one of the directors, Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, told a festival news conference on Friday.
<p> "It will make people think, feel, reflect, consider others and ask themselves questions about what they are doing," the director of "Amores Perros" added.
<p> Iranian director Samira Makhmalbaf agreed, calling the collection of short films -- each 11 minutes and nine seconds long -- "a healthy dialogue rather than a monologue".
<p> Some U.S. viewers at the film's first screening on Thursday said they were angered by a lack of solidarity with the United States but other film goers praised it as the best thing they had seen at the festival.
<p> "I think criticism is healthy," said "11'09"01" producer Alain Brigand. "Just because you criticise a country it does not mean you want to undermine it".
<p>
<p> "NOT CNN"
<p> The five directors promoting the film in Venice insisted they would not have signed up to the project if they had had to follow an editorial line.
<p> "This isn't CNN," said Israel's Amos Gitai, whose contribution shows a journalist trying to report live from a suicide attack in Tel Aviv only to be told something more important is happening in New York.
<p> "This dramatic event was a canvas for us to make our films. Americans might rightfully or wrongfully want to see recycled images of the towers but that's not our objective as directors," he added.
<p> As well as questioning the U.S. role in global politics, some films translated the attacks, blamed on Saudi-born militant Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network, onto a human level.
<p> Gonzalez Inarritu created a script from witness accounts of the attacks and radio station callers demanding death for terrorists and their families shown against a black screen with flashes of people jumping out of the burning towers.
<p> "What was scary for me was hearing Bush's speeches and bin Laden's speeches. They were all about God and good and evil -- the terminology was the same," he said.
<p> Meanwhile France's Claude Lelouch told the September 11 story through the life of a deaf woman breaking up with her boyfriend.
<p> "The human level has always been more important than world events. For some the end of a relationship is the end of the world," he said.
<p> The woman's prayer for a reconciliatory miracle is answered when the man comes back to her covered in dust after the Twin Towers collapsed.
<p> "It was a horrid drama but, as always, something good came out of it for somebody," 
said Lelouch.
