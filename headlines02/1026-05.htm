<p>WASHINGTON - Protesters hope as many as 100,000 people will converge on the 
U.S. capital on Saturday to demonstrate against a possible U.S. attack on Iraq.

</table></font>Demonstrators from as far as Chicago and Minnesota will
come to Washington, many by bus, to gather by the Vietnam war
memorial on the Mall and then march to the White House.
Speakers will include civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.<P> &quot;This is going to be an ugly, unnecessary fight. Most of
the world is saying no to it,&quot; Jackson told reporters.
&quot;Preemptive one-bullet diplomacy, we cannot resort to that.&quot;<P> A tandem 
demonstration -- expected to be equal in size to the gathering in the nation's 
capital -- will take place in San Francisco on Saturday.
<P> &quot;There is incredible momentum against (President George W.
) Bush, that will culminate in a massive outpouring that we
hope will be big enough to challenge and stop war plans against
Iraq,&quot; said Tony Murphy, one of the protest's organizers.<P> &quot;This has the potential to be as strong a movement as that
against the Vietnam war in the 1960s,&quot; he said, adding that the
march could draw as many as 100,000 students, veterans and
union members from across the country.<P> In the late 1960s, with the country mired in a costly
campaign to fight communism in Vietnam, hundreds of thousands
of demonstrators gathered in major cities to demonstrate
against the war.<P> Hours before the march in Washington was due to start,
several thousand protesters were assembling on the National
Mall. Some carried signs reading: &quot;No Proof, No War,&quot; &quot;Bush
Sucks&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice Oil for Justice.&quot;<P> SOCIAL PROGRAMS FAVORED OVER WAR<P> Protesters will call upon the U.S. government to abandon
war plans against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and to spend the
tens of billions of dollars the campaign could cost on social
programs in the United States.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

</table></font>They will also ask that sanctions imposed on the Middle
Eastern nation after the Gulf War in 1991 be lifted, as these
were blamed by protesters and groups such as UNICEF for the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians.<P> &quot;If violence fixed the problem, then Israel should be at
peace,&quot; said Rick Blumhorst of Kansas, a Gulf War veteran
wearing his Army dress uniform. &quot;Acting unilaterally, we're
going to inflame the Muslim community.&quot;<P> The U.S. Congress has approved a resolution that would give
Bush the power to declare war on Iraq, a campaign that the
president said would rid the country of suspected weapons of
mass destruction and possibly oust Saddam.<P> Tamir Musa, an Iraqi who has lived in Michigan for 10
years, traveled to Washington with about 500 other exiles to
show their support for efforts to remove Saddam from power.<P> &quot;The war is good if it goes to kill Saddam Hussein. He has
a lot of bombs; he's terrorist number one,&quot; Musa said.<P> A Reuters poll of 22 defense experts from around the world
found they believed it was likely the United States would
invade Iraq in the next six months.<P> In San Francisco, protest organizers expect thousands of
people from across the western states to attend a march and
rally near city hall. Speakers will include California
Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, who opposed a congressional
resolution on using force against Iraq, and Vietnam veteran Ron
Kovic, whose story was told in the movie &quot;Born on the Fourth of
July.&quot;<P> Antiwar protests are also planned for Saturday in cities
worldwide, including Mexico City, Copenhagen, Seoul, Tokyo,
Berlin and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Last month more than 150,000
people rallied in London against a campaign on Iraq.</p>
