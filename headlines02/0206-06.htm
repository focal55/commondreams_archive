United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan brought the second <a href="http://www.worldsocialforum.org" target="_new">World Social Forum</a> (WSF) to a close Tuesday, following six days of heated debate among 50,000 activists and rights groups gathered to hammer out proposals for economic policies that help close widening gaps between the world's rich and poor nations. 
<p>"You have come together to voice deep concerns and convictions about the direction in which globalization is taking our world and about what we should do to remedy it...I respect wholeheartedly your commitment," said Annan in a message to the forum which pledged to air these concerns among business leaders and government officials attending the World Economic Forum, held in New York at the same time as the WSF.

</table></font>The WSF--which took place in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, renowned for its innovative ways of managing its own public finances--reached its conclusion amid widespread satisfaction that it had built on recommendations made last year to work towards international adoption of tighter regulations on cross-border currency flows and on efforts by powerful companies to extend patents to cover living organisms.
<p>



British and Belgian academics won backing for a proposed treaty on global currency transactions which would levy a tax on currency markets to raise as much as US&#36;300 billion in poverty-alleviation funds each year, if set within the proposed range of between 10 and 25 cents per US&#36;100 traded. And hundreds of nongovernmental groups from more than 50 countries announced their support for a treaty that would oppose the extension of intellectual property rights to cover biological life.
<p>



After grappling with the an array of demands for peace and justice in the wake of the post-September 11 "war on terrorism," Brazilian state government officials, trade unionists, and rights activists signed up to a declaration which stated that a world without war could be achieved if finances were channeled into meeting the basic needs of impoverished people around the world.
<p>



"A world without war will be a world without hegemonies, a world with a democratized world power, supported by regional integration processes, expressing the interests of humanity's great majority," according to the statement 'For a World Without Wars.'
<p>



Delegates from Africa and Asia also reaffirmed the important role of the WSF in amplifying the voices of those who are often ignored by major international forums, such as the World Economic Forum, which attract closer media coverage.
<p>



"The WSF is a source of strength to those countries where the movement is still trying to build itself up," said Aasim Saijaad Akthar, from the People's Rights Movements in Pakistan. "It is a chance to tell the stories and exchange experiences of people who suffer from repression by highly authoritarian states."
<p>



However, Akthar pointed to low numbers of WSF delegates from Asia and Africa as a downside of the forum.
<p>



"Due to this under-representation, analysis on the specific issues of our continents and nations are sometimes...shallow. This is a serious shortcoming for us," said Akthar
<p>



In an effort to increase the mix of delegates from outside Europe and the Americas, the WSF will be moved to India in 2004, although the 2003 gathering will again be in Porto Alegre, which was the venue for the inaugural WSF last year.
<p>



In addition, delegates plan to set up regional meetings throughout the year, including an Asia-Africa World Social Forum in Kathmandu, Nepal, and a Peace Forum in Jerusalem.
