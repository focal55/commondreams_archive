<p> BAGHDAD  - Saddam Hussein announced plans to  address the Iraqi nation as a new report Wednesday said U.S.  armed forces chiefs were now agreed on using force to oust him.<p>With nervous Iraqis sensing an attack is becoming ever more  inevitable and loyal officials voicing angry defiance, Saddam  was to make a "comprehensive national speech" on television on  Thursday morning, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said.<p>While marking the anniversary of the end of the 1980-88 war  with Iran, he may well seek to prepare Iraqis for a new war.</span>
<p>This time it would be against the superpower to which he  led them once before to defeat, in the Gulf War of 1991.<p>That the Americans will come appeared even more likely  following the latest media leak in the United States in the  battle to influence policy on Iraq. The Washington Times said  on Wednesday that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff had overcome  their differences and had reached a consensus on using military  force.<p>Nearly a week after its surprise offer to discuss the  return of United Nations weapons inspectors, Iraq had no  immediate response to a letter from U.N. Secretary General Kofi  Annan rejecting the move until he received a "formal  invitation."<p>Bitter remarks about the U.N.'s chief inspector Hans Blix,  reported in a newspaper Wednesday, seemed unlikely to further  the resolution of Baghdad's dispute with the United Nations.<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri told United Arab Emirates  newspaper al-Bayan that Hans Blix, a Swede, had caved in to  "U.S. pressure and blackmail."<p>A resumption of inspections aimed at stopping Iraq  acquiring weapons of mass destruction could increase pressure  on the United States from its European and Arab allies not to  attack.<p>ALLIES DIVIDED<p>There were new signs of division when German Chancellor  Gerhard Schroeder, seeking left-wing support to stave off  defeat in a September election, warned a strike on Iraq would  wreck the coalition behind President Bush's "war on terrorism."<p>Citing unnamed Bush administration officials, however, the  Washington Times said all six of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff  now agreed on moving against Saddam. Some had earlier had  objections based on concerns about casualties from chemical  weapons and the potential for an open-ended occupation of Iraq.<p>"The chiefs have come over because they can read the  handwriting on the wall," the Times quoted an administration  official as saying. "Now the senior leadership is on board."<p>Giving a flavor of the mood among Saddam's loyal elite, the  speaker of Iraq's parliament, Saadoun Hammadi, told an  extraordinary session on Wednesday: "Threats against Iraq will  not intimidate anyone and they are doomed to fail."<p>"Our people are united, our faith is strong, our means are  mobilized and active and our material and spiritual abilities  are great," Hammadi added. Parliament also reiterated an offer,  already dismissed, for U.S. congressmen to visit Iraq.<p>On the streets of Baghdad, ordinary people are increasingly  convinced that war is inevitable and imminent, although there  seems little enthusiasm for a conflict.<p>"We are not stupid, we hear the drums of war beating in the  distance," said Mohammad, a shop owner in the Iraqi capital.<p>"When the president of the world's only superpower says he  wants to do something, he will try to do it. It doesn't mean  he'll succeed but he will definitely try to do it," he said.<p>Bush accuses Saddam of being a menace to the region and has  said he is "looking at all options" to deal with him.<p>But while Bush seems set on a showdown with the leader his  father failed to dislodge as president during the Gulf War 11  years ago, an attack on Iraq could prove costly.<p>IRAQ APPEALS TO BRITAIN<p>Only Britain, whose planes patrol no-fly zones in northern  and southern Iraq along with the Americans, seems ready to  support Bush's war and Iraq Wednesday appealed to London to  stop supporting the U.S. plans for war.<p>"Nobody supports the United States except Britain," Iraqi  representative in London Mudhafar Amin told Reuters.<p>"If Britain refused to go along with the United States' war  against Iraq then I think the American administration would  find it very difficult to go ahead."<p>Other European leaders and many Arab states oppose an  attack or are at best lukewarm. NATO-member Turkey worries  about the domestic impact and even leaders of the northern  Iraqi Kurds, who have little reason to love Saddam, warned Bush  not to count on their unconditional support.<p>But the biggest casualty of a war against Iraq might be  Bush's "war on terrorism," which garnered a worldwide consensus  following the September 11 attacks.<p>Schroeder, whose chances of re-election look slim, told  Bild newspaper: "This war is not yet won, so I warn against an  attack on Iraq. It would be less easily understood as an act of  defense and could destroy the international alliance against  terror."
<p>European Union leaders agree that Saddam must let U.N. weapons inspectors back 
into Iraq unconditionally, but the issue could be divisive for the EU if the United 
States and Britain attacked Iraq without a fresh U.N. mandate.</span>
