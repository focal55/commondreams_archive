<p>TOKYO   - China reacted angrily Monday after  Japan's top government spokesman hinted that the only nation to  suffer a nuclear attack could abandon its hallowed ban on  nuclear weapons.
<P>
					
				The fuss was the latest headache for Prime Minister  Junichiro Koizumi, struggling to enact key laws amid a  precipitous slide in his public support due to doubts over his  leadership and commitment to reform.
<P>
					
				The furor threatened to broaden into a diplomatic row after  China blasted the comments. Ties between the two Asian  neighbors were strained last month over North Korean asylum  seekers seized by Chinese police from a Japanese consulate.
<P>
					
				Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told a news conference  that he was responsible for remarks attributed to a senior  official that Tokyo could review its ban on nuclear arms.
<P>
					
				Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said the  comments violated Japan's promises to the international  community, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
<P>
					
				"At the present time when peace and development have become  the main themes of the times and continued progress is being  made in international nuclear disarmament, it is shocking to  hear remarks like this from a senior Japanese official," Kong  said.
<P>
					
				LATEST HEADACHE
<P>
					
				Fukuda downplayed his comments, saying: "I only said there  is a chance the government could take another look at the three  non-nuclear principles in the future.
<P>
					
				"There is absolutely no chance that this cabinet will  discuss revising these principles."
<P>
					
				Opposition parties, however, called for Fukuda's head and  boycotted parliamentary debate on key legislation.
<P>
					
				Conservative politicians have become more outspoken in  challenging Japan's postwar pacifism, but fears over domestic  and diplomatic fallout have meant they are usually forced to  retract suggestions Japan should drop its ban on nuclear  weapons.
<P>
					
				Koizumi said there was no need for the political tempest.
<P>
					
				"Why are they making waves when I have said we are not  going to revise (the principles)?" he told reporters.
<P>
					
				Saturday, local media quoted an unidentified senior  government official as saying Tokyo could review its  self-imposed "three principles," which ban the possession,  production and import of nuclear arms.
<P>
					
				"The principles are just like the Constitution. But in the  face of calls to amend the Constitution, the amendment of the  principles is also likely," Kyodo news agency quoted the senior  government official as saying.
<P>
					
				Fukuda told the news conference, however, that media  interpretations of the remark were incorrect.
<P>
					
				It was the latest remark from a series of hawkish officials  and politicians seeking to challenge Japan's postwar pacifism.
<P>
					
				Opposition Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa drew a sharp  response from Beijing in April when he said Japan could easily  make nuclear weapons and surpass China's military might.
<P>
					
				Ozawa later said his remarks had been distorted and  misreported.
<P>
					
				Experts say Tokyo does have the wherewithal to put together  a nuclear bomb in short order, but talking about the issue has  been politically taboo.
<P>
					
				Parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Shingo Nishimura had to  resign in 1999 after suggesting parliament should debate the  nuclear ban -- a sentiment analysts say many lawmakers in the  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other parties share.
<P>
					
				"Every once in a while, someone in the LDP says what they  really think -- that Japan should rearm and have nuclear  weapons," said Steven Reed, a political science professor at  Chuo University. "It is not a new departure."
<P>
					
				A new row is the last thing Koizumi needs as he struggles  to enact key pieces of legislation in the current session of  parliament, set to end on June 19.
<P>
					
				An extension appears all but inevitable, since Koizumi has  yet to enact key legislation including his pet project of  postal service reform and controversial bills that officials  say are needed to improve Japan's ability to defend itself.
<P>
					
				Koizumi has already seen his public support plummet since  his January sacking of the popular Makiko Tanaka as foreign  minister and a series of scandals in his long-ruling LDP.
<P>
					
				A survey released Monday by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper  put Koizumi's support at 40 percent -- neck and neck with his  disapproval rating and a far cry from the 90 percent he enjoyed  when he took office last year.
