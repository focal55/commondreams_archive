He championed non-violence, vegetarianism, democracy and simple living. Now, thanks to a deal struck in the highest echelons of the marketing world, Mahatma Gandhi could soon be championing a wide variety of useful household products.

</table></font>In a move that will raise eyebrows among pacifists, the Indian hero's great-grandson has struck a deal with a US licensing agency to market the rights to his famous ancestor's name and image.  
<P>The peace-loving hero of Indian independence now finds himself in the company of Marilyn Monroe, Rock Hudson, Ginger Rogers, Peter Sellers and Garfield the Cat.  
<P>All are on the books of CMG Worldwide, an Indiana company which represents the estates of more than 200 deceased "personalities".  
<P>Tushar Gandhi, a 38-year-old graphic designer from Bombay who heads the <a href="http://www.mahatma.org.in/">Mahatma Gandhi Foundation</a>, said he struck the deal to protect his great-grandfather's legacy after a major US bank asked to use his name in an advert. He said he would use the   funds to rebuild the former home of Gandhi's wife, and to build a dam in Gandhi's home state of Gujarat.  
<P>"We make a percentage out of this, just like if it were Princess Diana or Babe Ruth,"    said Beth Vahle, a senior vice-president at CMG. "But we enjoy working to promote this cause to a generation that isn't used to it, and only classy, well-put-together things will be allowed to promote the Gandhi   name." She would not disclose the percentage that the agency would take on income from Gandhi-related merchandise.  
<P>"I do not want his name or image to be used irreverently, such as on a meat product, or lingerie," Mr Gandhi told Agence France-Presse. "I have stipulated that for any usage of his image, the final design and where and how it is going to be used will have to be shown to me for commercial purposes. I will not charge for the use of non-commercial purposes."  
<P>He has reason to be wary: the prophet of nonviolence has already been used to advertise Johnny Walker whisky (he did not drink) and Apple Computers.  
<P>"When Apple ran that ad, they made a very minimal contribution, and it's a pity we weren't representing &#91;Gandhi&#93;, otherwise we could have got a very sizeable contribution," says Kunal Dua, a CMG executive born in India who helped negotiate the deal. "Now that they've got American representation, big companies who can afford to pay a lot will pay a lot. We're not doing charity here, of course, but it gives us great satisfaction that it goes to the right people."   
<P>The "clients", as CMG calls them, focus on showbusiness and sports - including Bette Davis, Gloria Swanson, Buddy Holly and the baseball star Jackie Robinson - but the agency has been branching out into literature, history and politics in recent years.  
<P>Famous names whose heirs have struck deals with CMG include Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Jack Kerouac, Frank Lloyd Wright and Malcolm X.  
<P>"With each estate, we have a different thing in mind," said Ms Vahle. "With Marilyn Monroe or James Dean, there's obviously a lot of merchandise licensing - for posters, prints, furniture with Marilyn's name on it. But we like to represent &#91;all&#93; the greatest legends of the 20th century, and for someone like Gandhi, the arrangement would be different."  
<P>CMG employs a team of lawyers to clamp down on those it labels "infringers".  
<P>Gandhi's legacy is already passionately protected in his homeland. Earlier this year a court in Jaipur officially censured fashion show organizers who used Gandhi's picture on a model's back on the grounds that it was an insult to the Indian nation.
