JERUSALEM, April 30 -- Inside Yasser Arafat's gloomy, airless offices, a band of rumpled activists are ready to celebrate the end of their self-appointed role as bodyguards to the Palestinian leader.
<p> Since March 29, when the Israeli army began its siege of the Palestinian Authority's West Bank headquarters in Ramallah, the group has camped out in Arafat's offices, enduring what one member called "a big, gigantic, stinky slumber party." They make odd housemates for an Arab politician: a collection of European, American and even Israeli peace activists who moved in uninvited to share quarters with the Palestinian chief.</p>
    
<p> The activists, who operate under the name <a href="http://www.palsolidarity.org/" target="_new">International Solidarity Movement</a>, say they believe that by putting themselves in the line of fire, they will cause Israel to use more restraint than it would if dealing only with Palestinians. So they have slept in Arafat's offices, even posting a few people to curl up on blankets outside his room at night. </p>
    <p> They are convinced they have succeeded -- that their presence helped moderate Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's actions and added to the international pressure that resulted in an agreement Sunday to lift the siege. </p>
    <p> "I have no doubt that Sharon was planning to come in here and deport or exile the president [Arafat]," Neta Golan, 30, a Canadian Israeli who has been in the compound for 29 days, said by cell phone from inside the compound. "We made the operation complicated for him, if not impossible."</p>
    <p> It is difficult to determine what weight their presence had on Israeli or international considerations. But to the activists, the vigil has been a validation of their get-in-the-middle style of intervention. </p>
    <p> "I think there is a likelihood that it would have been different without us," Golan said.</p>
    <p> The activists put their bodies where their politics are. They ride in Palestinian ambulances that are often stopped and sometimes shot at by Israelis. They sleep in Palestinian villages they suspect are vulnerable to attack. They challenge Israeli checkpoints and police lines to join Palestinians under siege.</p>
    <p> Two members were at Arafat's compound when the siege began. Three days later, a group of 60 arrived. Some have left; others have braved Israeli warning shots to join those inside. About 30 are in the compound now, sleeping in two crowded rooms, grumbling over the dwindling food supplies and giving interviews to reporters when their cell phones are not being jammed.</p>
    <p> The announcement Sunday that Israel had accepted a U.S. plan to end the siege in Ramallah brought cheers from the group, though the days needed to work out the details have been a difficult addendum, according to Kevin Skvorak, 39, a New York freelance film technician who said he came to Ramallah because "the injustice and the inequities are so clear."</p>
    <p> In the last few days, those inside have watched as the Israeli army stepped up the destruction of property within the compound. They said the army has gutted nearby offices of the Palestinian Authority with explosives, and used a bulldozer to ram dozens of official cars outside the compound and scrape them into a huge pile.</p>
    <p> "The cars are now a totally surrealistic picture of siege," Golan said. "These are new cars, shiny red and blue cars, all in a pile. Salvador Dali would like this scene."</p>
    <p> The army seized control of all of Arafat's compound except part of one building. The foreign activists have shared the cramped quarters with Arafat, his aides and dozens of Palestinian guards and office workers trapped there. The Palestinian leader sleeps and works upstairs, and his guards and the foreigners sleep on blankets or rumpled sheets downstairs.</p>
    <p> For the first 17 days, there was no water and little electricity. There was "a particular smell," said one diplomat who visited.</p>
    <p> "We stank," Golan said. </p>
    <p> Everyone complained about the shared toilet. The chain-smoking Palestinians shared their dwindling cigarettes -- three persons to each cigarette, according to peace activists and diplomats who have been inside.</p>
    <p> "It's pretty close to unlivable," said another diplomatic visitor.</p>
    <p> The group persuaded Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to smuggle in fresh women's underwear in his briefcase when he visited the compound, and bargained with the Israeli army for 25 bars of soap. </p>
    <p> In Bethlehem, where Palestinians are besieged at the Church of the Nativity, the Israeli army has played a deafening audiotape of screeching, screaming and metallic scraping in a form of psychological warfare. The foreigners in Ramallah say they think their presence has dissuaded the army from such tactics.</p>
    <p> "I think we have made it easier for the people here, and provided some comedy relief," Skvorak said.</p>
    <p> With the end of the siege in sight, "everyone is jumping around and joking and dancing. All the Europeans are happy," he said. </p>
    <p> "I hope to be going back to New York soon," he added. "We hope to be out within 24 hours, eat some good food, breathe some fresh air, have a little party, and then think about what we do from here."</p>
