<p>BRUSSELS - A Brussels appeals court threw out a lawsuit against Israeli Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon on Wednesday, ruling he was immune from investigation in 
Belgium over his alleged role in a 1982 massacre of Palestinian refugees.

Palestinian Souad Srour El Meri (R), one of a group of Palestinians accusing Israeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon war crimes for his alleged role in the 1982 massacre 
of the Sabra-Shatila refugee camps, answers reporters' questions next to Moroccan 
Najat Yassine, at the Brussels Justice Palace, June 26, 2002. The appeals court 
threw out the case against Sharon, on the grounds he had no links to Belgium.

</table></font>"What the court decided is that the complaint against  Sharon ... is not admissible because of the principle of  Belgian law that crimes committed in other countries cannot be  prosecuted in Belgium unless the author or presumed author has  been found in Belgium," a court spokesman said.
<p>The ruling deals a major blow to Belgium's law giving the country's courts 
the right to try foreigners for serious human rights abuses wherever they are 
committed.<span class="newsContent">It was under this controversial law that a group of  Palestinian and Lebanese filed the complaint last year,  accusing Sharon of genocide, war crimes and crimes against  humanity.<p>Michael Verhaeghe, one of the lawyers for the group of  Palestinians, told reporters that his clients would appeal to  the country's Supreme Court of Appeal.<p>"We are not satisfied with this," he said. "It completely  undermines the scope of universal jurisdiction. We are  appealing to the Supreme Court. The fight goes on, that's  clear."<p>In Lebanon, Palestinian refugees read the ruling as a sign  that Europe had joined the United States in backing Israel in  its conflict with Palestinians, and that they could expect no  justice in its courts.<p>"There were already steps to head off the court  proceedings, but they let them go on to display a sort of  fraudulent democracy," said Hussein al-Jamal, a 42-year-old  resident of the Rashidiyeh camp in south Lebanon.<p>"MORE LAW THAN POLITICS"<p>But there was jubilation among Sharon's backers when, after  a nail-biting delay of nearly two hours, photocopies of the  22-page ruling were distributed from a dusty room on the corner  of Brussels' Palais de Justice.<p>"It's a lawsuit that started with more politics than law  and it is lucky that the outcome is more law than politics,"  Daniel Shek, director of European Affairs at the Israeli  Foreign Ministry, told reporters at the court. "It's what we  considered a logical outcome, we trusted the system and the  system did not let us down."<p>In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told  reporters: "I think they shouldn't even have tried to (bring  the case to court). One nation cannot judge another nation. A  nation that doesn't, fortunately, have to fight terror and war  will hardly understand a nation that has to do it."<p>Sharon was defense minister in 1982 when an Israeli-backed  Lebanese militia killed hundreds of refugees at the Sabra and  Shatila camps in Beirut, then occupied by Israel. The following  year, an Israeli commission found him indirectly responsible.<p>A criminal investigation was suspended last September  pending a ruling on Belgium's jurisdiction.<p>Two previous rulings had already chipped away at the  validity of the law, which has caused embarrassment for the  Belgian government and strained its ties with Israel.<p>In February, the International Court of Justice at the  Hague snubbed Belgian claims of universal jurisdiction by  upholding the immunity of former Congolese Foreign Minister  Yerodia Aboulaye Ndombasi from prosecution in Belgium.<p>The decision resulted in an order to cancel Belgium's  international arrest warrant against him, issued in 2000, for  crimes against humanity.<p>In an another precedent-setting ruling two months later,  the Brussels appeals court threw out a case against Yerodia,  who was accused of inciting racial hatred, on the grounds that  he had not been found in Belgium.<p>CATASTROPHE SCENARIO<p>It was on this ground of links between the accused and  Belgium -- and not diplomatic immunity -- that the  investigation into Sharon was halted by the appeals court  Wednesday.<p>"This decision is a great disappointment not only to the  victims of the massacres of Sabra and Shatila but to atrocity  victims everywhere who have placed their hopes for justice in  the Belgian courts," said Reed Brody, a spokesman for Human  Rights Watch.<p>Montserrat Carreras of rights group Amnesty International,  pointing out that if the case had been thrown out on immunity  grounds it could have been taken up again when Sharon left  office, said Wednesday's ruling was "the catastrophe scenario."<p>Lawyer Verhaeghe said his clients' case in the Supreme  Court of Appeal would now hang on whether it could be proved  that Sharon was in Belgium in 1987. Two liberal Belgian  senators said they would introduce a bill in the senate for a  change in the law to ensure that people who are not in Belgium  can be prosecuted.
<p>"The bill is ready. It is just a matter of days," senator Vincent Van Quickenborne, 
a Flemish liberal, said.</span>
