</table>
</font>The federal trial, which began Monday in Georgia, involves activists who 
attended an annual human-rights protest at the Fort Benning Military Base in Columbus, 
Ga.</P>
<P>Desautels is one of approximately 6,000 who attended the protest against the 
newly renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly 
known as School of the Americas, which is a combat training school for Latin American 
soldiers.</P>
<P>The WHISC has trained more than 60,000 soldiers in counterinsurgency techniques, 
sniper training, commando and psychological warfare, military intelligence and 
other tactics, according to the <a href="http://www.soaw.org" target="_new">School 
of the Americas Watch</a> organization. The training is funded by U.S. taxpayers 
and conducted in Spanish, said a public affairs representative at Fort Benning. 
</P>
<P>The controversy over the training techniques has ignited across the country 
and even into Congress, where nine bills have been introduced to shut down the 
school. Only two Senate bills proposing to shut down the WHISC remain active.</P>
<P>During the protest in November, Desautels and the 36 others on trial were detained 
by the FBI on charges of illegally trespassing on the grounds of the Fort Benning 
Army base. </P>
<P>Desautels carried a coffin to symbolize victims in the Americas and defied 
a court order by participating in a procession onto the grounds of the Army base. 
Since 1997, Desautels has been arrested six times for breaching the fort's grounds, 
but has served only a day or two in jail.</P>
<P>Standing trial with the Sister of Providence are citizens from many walks of 
life, including an 18-year old from Colorado and a 72 year-old priest from San 
Francisco.</P>
<P>As of early Monday afternoon, six of eight defendants intending to plead guilty 
to the trespassing charges already had done so. </P>
<P>Attorney Bill Quigley, who is defending 28 of the 37 on trial, believes it 
is only a matter of time before the WHISC will be forced to close, and explained 
that the defendants are under no illusion as to what could happen. Presiding Judge 
Mallon Faircloth sentenced an 88-year-old nun to a six-month jail sentence last 
year for similar law violations.</P>
<P>"We've been trying to close [WHISC] for 10 years, and Congress came within 
one vote of cutting all funding, and so this is when the Pentagon stepped in and 
reconstituted the school under a different name," Quigley said during a short 
break from the trial Monday. "It was really just a cosmetic change to try and 
divert the Legislature, and it has worked so far, but it's not a question of if, 
it's a question of when."</P>
<P>Quigley said Faircloth appears to be moved by the sincerity and commitment 
of the defendants, but obviously does not agree with the methods they have chosen.</P>
<P>The trial is expected to last through the week.</P>
<P>"[The defendants] feel that justice has to be served, just like those who fought 
for the runaway slaves in the 1800s, advocated civil rights in the '60s, and also 
those who sheltered the Jews in Germany," Quigley said. "All of these people may 
have technically broken the laws, but in the name of a much higher justice, and 
history will show that all of these people are actually heroes."</P>
<P>The remaining defendants will plead not guilty, Quigley said. Desautels has 
been chosen to represent this group in speaking to the judge about their motives, 
according to the Sisters of Providence.</P>
<P>Three other Sisters of Providence have traveled to Georgia with Desautels to 
support her during the trial.</P>
<P>"I have admiration for [Desautels] that she is willing to do this, and stand 
her ground -- I know it's a little scary, but she is very calm about this," said 
Sister Marsha Speth, a spokeswoman for Desautels.</P>
<P>"She's trying to be peaceful and open with it, that she could potentially serve 
six months of jail time, so she's trying to hold that loosely. She believes very 
strongly in what she is doing, and she has been deeply affected by those who have 
lost relatives from the atrocities in the Americas." </P>
<P>Desautels, a 42-year member of the Sisters of Providence, is an Indianapolis 
native who taught at St. Mary-of-the-Woods Village School in 1964 and at St. Peter 
School in Linton from 1968 to 1969. She also served as coordinator of religious 
education at St. Peter's parish from 1969 to 1970. </P>
<P>Among the notorious graduates of this training school include dictators Manuel 
Noriega and Omar Torrijos of Panama. The massacre of six Jesuit priests, their 
housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador in 1989 also is attributed to graduates 
of the School of Americas, according to the watch group. </P>
<P>The generals who orchestrated the unsuccessful overthrow of the democratically 
elected president in Venezuela earlier this year also were graduates of the Fort 
Benning training school, Quigley said.</P>
<P>It is largely because of the incident in 1989 that the SOAW movement was formed 
a year later. The SOAW, a grassroots organization which advocates nonviolent protests 
against human-rights violations and to encourage democracy, has rallied for years 
to close the WHISC.</P>
<P>"This is definitely a school that targets warfare; this is terrorism taught 
right here in the U.S., said Matthew Smucker, a global activist who works at the 
SOAW office in Washington, D.C. "We have no reason to believe the school has changed.</P>
<P>"It's disgusting that these citizens could get jail time for basically serving 
their civic duty in trying to call the government into accountability for their 
policy," he added.</P>
<P>Rich McDowell, public affairs officer at Fort Benning, believes WHISC is different 
from its predecessor, and those who support the SOAW are essentially insulting 
the U.S. military and its positive missions.</P>
<P>"To say that American soldiers are teaching torture and all of the things they 
claim are taught -- that is a total insult to every American soldier," said McDowell. 
</P>
<P>"In relation to the events occurring in the Americas, it is so ridiculous to 
claim that there is a cause-and-effect for the education these people received 
at Fort Benning. It's like holding Harvard responsible for the Unibomber," he 
added.</P>
<P>In defense of the WHISC "training future offenders," McDonnell adamantly believes 
that Fort Benning is making a difference for the positive. The WHISC seeks to 
foster good relations with America's close neighbors in Central and South America.</P>
<P>"[The SOAW and activists] are totally off the wall. That is what our Army is 
all about, to defend the Constitution and our civil rights, and they can protest 
as long as they do it legally and peacefully," he said. "When they trespassed, 
they were violating law.</P>
<P>"For these people to accuse us of these atrocities and murders -- they are 
just doing it for media attention. If what they are accusing us were true, we 
would have been closed years ago," asserted McDowell.</P>
<P>The reasons behind the name change of the former School of Americas in January 
2001 supply a controversy as well. In 1996, the training base admitted openly 
to having material in its manuals relating to interrogation techniques such as 
torture, execution and blackmail.</P>
<P>Many from the SOAW believe the school may exist under a "different name, but 
has the same shame." Smucker and others find it to be a public relations ploy, 
contending it is essentially the same structure with the same instructors.</P>
<P>"Renaming the school was a cynical move to try and quell resistance and disassociate 
the school from its dubious reputation," Smucker said. "They have earned the reputation, 
and its list of graduates are some of the worst offenders in this hemisphere.</P>
<P>"Thousands of people wouldn't travel across the country and risk incarceration 
for a frivolous reason or media attention," Smucker said. "Obviously many people 
are concerned about human rights, and they are dedicated citizens."</span></P>
