The numbers, in a department letter written to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., are the 
first accounting of the magnitude of closed-door legal proceedings conducted as 
part of new, sweeping anti-terrorism laws, civil-rights advocates said yesterday. 
<P> The numbers, they say, raise questions about how well the government has targeted 
its terrorism probe and whether hundreds have been deported without due process. 
<P> An official in Attorney General John Ashcroft's Justice Department said yesterday 
that hearings are closed and information about them is limited to protect the 
privacy of detainees and the terrorism investigation. 
<P> "This information, if made public, could let the terrorists know things we 
don't want them to know," department spokesman Mark Corallo said. 
<P> Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) 
in Michigan, said she thinks most of the people subject to the hearings are facing 
deportation. 
<P> "I don't think we had any idea that this number of people had been subjected 
to closed hearings," she said. 
<P> "The implications are very serious. If none of these people have been charged 
with any criminal-law violations, then John Ashcroft has essentially, on his own, 
created two systems of justice in this country." 
<P> Levin, in his role as chairman of the permanent subcommittee on investigations, 
asked the department in March for a detailed accounting of terrorism detainees. 
<P> "It took the Justice Department more than three months to produce a partial 
response to my letter," Levin said this week. But it "raises a number of additional 
questions, including why closed hearings were necessary for so many people," Levin 
said. He said he plans to press the department for more answers. 
<P> In a July 3 letter to Levin, Assistant Attorney General Daniel Bryant said 
that, as of May 29, 611 individuals detained by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS) had had at least one closed hearing. 
<P> The letter, although short on many details requested by Levin, offered a rare 
glimpse of the government's anti-terrorism efforts that previously were only guessed 
at or gathered in bits and pieces. 
<P> In the early months of the investigation, Justice Department officials said 
that up to 1,200 people had been detained nationally. But the letter says 752 
individuals had been detained by the INS in connection with the terror probe, 
and 611 of those had secret hearings. 
<P> It's unclear why there is a discrepancy between the detainee numbers, and 
that's one of the questions Levin wants answered. The INS still has 81 people 
in custody, according to the letter. 
<P> The most striking element of the investigation, immigration and legal experts 
said, was the number of closed hearings. 
<P> Aside from hearings for asylum seekers, which are closed for privacy reasons 
and can be open if the asylum seeker requests it, most immigration court hearings 
are open to the public, immigration lawyers said. 
<P> But that changed after Sept. 11. Immigrants with visa violations who were 
arrested allegedly in connection to the terrorist attacks were designated "special 
interest" detainees. 
<P> Hearings were closed to their families and the public by an order from Chief 
U.S. Immigration Judge Michael Creppy on Sept. 21. Creppy issued the order at 
the behest of Ashcroft, who has been criticized for damaging civil rights in his 
effort to root out terrorists. 
<P> Two major lawsuits &#151; including one brought by the Detroit Free Press, 
other newspapers and the ACLU &#151; challenged Creppy's directive. 
<P> In April, U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds ruled in Detroit that the closed 
hearings were unconstitutional and ordered the secret INS hearings of Ann Arbor, 
Mich., charity fund-raiser Rabih Haddad be opened. The government appealed the 
ruling. Appeal arguments will be heard by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
in Cincinnati on Aug. 6. 
<P> Haddad's charity has been accused of funding terrorist organizations, but 
he's being held on visa violations. 
<P> Even activists who have been fighting to open the closed hearings said they 
had no idea there were so many. Some say the government is cloaking its activities 
out of embarrassment. 
<P> Men once portrayed as strong links to the al-Qaida terrorist network now are 
being charged with minor visa violations and deported. 
<P> "It turned out these people are not criminals, they are not terrorists," said 
Imad Hamad, Midwestern regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 
Committee. "Yes, they are in violation of certain immigration rules &#151; which 
before Sept. 11 was not a reason to be dumped out of the country." 
<P>Public oversight is important because abuses happen when nobody is watching, 
said Lee Gelernt, senior staff counsel for the national ACLU's Immigrants' Rights 
Project. 
<P>"It is difficult to overstate the importance of public scrutiny of the INS 
process," Gelernt said, "where detainees are facing a trained prosecutor, often 
without counsel, and the outcome of the hearing will literally determine whether 
they are locked up for months, and then deported."
