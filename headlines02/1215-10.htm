<p>BAGHDAD  - If a U.S.-led war with Iraq smears
blood on his hands as an American citizen, Sean Penn  wants to
know why -- and he has come to Baghdad to find out.

</table></font>"Absolutely I think war can be avoided, but obviously it's
going to take enormous commitment on the part of the Iraqi
government as well as the United States," the actor-director
told Reuters television in an interview on Sunday.
 <p>
 "I will certainly do what I can to support that commitment
to looking for other options," Penn said.
 
<p>
 The former Hollywood bad boy and Oscar nominee paid for a
&#36;56,000 advertisement in the Washington Post in October
accusing President Bush  of stifling debate on Iraq.
 <p>
 He declined to renew his criticism of Bush on foreign soil,
saying he would reserve political comments for his return home.
 
<p>
 Bush has threatened war to topple President Saddam Hussein 
if he fails to abandon his alleged doomsday arsenal.
 <p>
 Penn said it would "suit us all" if Iraq fully disclosed
any banned weapons it still has, but questioned whether U.S.
national security concerns about this justified war.
 <p>
 Asked if his three-day trip to Baghdad might expose him to
charges of lack of patriotism, Penn said he would be happy to
debate anyone who made such accusations.
 <p>
 "I'm here for a simple reason, which is because I'm a
patriot and an American who has benefited enormously from being
an American, and because I had areas of personal concern and
conscience that led me to come to Iraq.
 <p>
 "I believe, however I vote and whatever my perspective,
that I do deserve the government I get," he said.
 <p>
 "And if there's going to be blood on my hands, I'm
determined that it's not going to be invisible. That blood is
not just Iraqi blood, it's the blood of American soldiers."
<p>
SMILING IN ADVERSITY
<p>
Penn's visit was organized by the <a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">Institute of Public
Accuracy</a>, a U.S. group of policy analysts.
<p>
He has toured a Baghdad children's hospital, wandered the
streets without an Iraqi minder and had meetings with Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and Health Minister Umeed Madhat
Mubarak -- who gave him a hard time for his smoking habit.
<p>
Penn said he had been touched by the warmth of ordinary
Iraqis despite the tension and suffering of their daily lives.
<p>
"I do find it very moving, you know, the strength of a
smile in those circumstances, and the smiles that I saw were
abundant," he said.
<p>
Penn's advertisement in the Washington Post took the form
of an open letter in which he urged Bush to stop a cycle where
"bombing is answered by bombing, mutilation by mutilation,
killing by killing."
<p>
"Sacrificing American soldiers or innocent civilians in an
unprecedented pre-emptive attack on a separate sovereign nation
may well prove itself a most temporary medicine," he said.
<p>
More than 100 other American celebrities, including
Hollywood stars Kim Basinger, David Duchovny  and Mia Farrow,
signed an open letter last week which said rigorous United
Nations inspections were the best way to disarm Iraq, not war.
<p>
"HEIGHTENED DESPERATION"
<p>
Asked to explain his interest in Iraq, Penn said it was the
"current headline" for the Bush administration's war on terror.
<p>
"It's a war that is going to affect the generation of my
children," he said.
<p>
"Because of the technology and the heightened desperation
of the world today, I think it's very possible that we are
facing the first century that will complete itself without
mankind -- and that's not the future that I want for my
children, or for their children," he declared.
<p>
Penn said his Iraq odyssey, by helping him to be aware of
the times he lived in, could play into his professional life.
<p>
"Whatever story you have to tell, you have to be aware of
who you are telling it to and what the benefit of it is,
whether it's limited to amusement or a political statement,
because short of that it's simply what someone does alone in a
bathroom," the 42-year-old Californian said.
<p>
Did he hope to bridge the gap between American perceptions
of Iraq and the reality?
<p>
"I have to start with bridging my own gap," he replied.
<p>
"Ultimately if I can do that in the way you expressed, that
would be something I'd be very proud of."
