</table></font>The test was the second and last in a series that analysts  said was a signal to nuclear rival India at a time of increased  tension and aimed to enhance the military's image just two days  before it officially hands the country over to civilian rule.<p>It also coincided with the last phase of a state assembly  election in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Himalayan region  that was the trigger for two of the three wars India and  Pakistan have fought since their independence in 1947.<p>President Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless  coup in 1999, enjoys broad support in Pakistan, and standing up  to arch-foe India is likely to prove popular.<p>While not seen as a direct vote-winner for pro-Musharraf  parties in Thursday's Pakistani poll, analysts said the missile  test is the military's way of showing that the country needs a  strong general at the helm, just 48 hours before the election.<p>"The army is creating a sense of fear in the public's  mind," said Pervez Hoodbye, an academic and commentator in  Islamabad.<p>"It is the only way that the military can survive, to  create this mentality and sense of being besieged by India. He  has to occasionally rattle his sabers and issue threats now and  then."<p>Musharraf will remain as president for another five years  after the poll, and although he has promised to hand power over  to an elected parliament, analysts and ordinary Pakistanis  expect him to go on running the country.<p>He has been accused by political opponents of a brazen  attempt to hold on to power by banning key opponents, enhancing  his powers, extending his tenure by five years in a widely  criticized referendum and backing a key political party.<p>"All this interference is going to undermine the  credibility of elections," said Afrasiab Khattack, chairman of  the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.<p>"The blatant manner in which the electoral process is being  vulgarized and the will of the people mocked is extremely  worrying," the group added in a statement.<p>INDIAN TENSIONS<p>Tuesday's missile test was the second in five days and a  repeat of Friday's successful launch of a medium-range Hatf-IV  (Shaheen-1) surface-to-surface missile.<p>Jane's Defense Weekly says the Shaheen-1 has a range of  about 430 miles and can carry a 2,200-pound warhead.<p>Friday, India test-fired a short-range surface-to-air  missile of its own just hours after Pakistan's exercise and  linked Islamabad's actions to the Pakistani election.<p>Tuesday, when asked in Berlin what India would do in  reaction to the latest test, Indian External Affairs Minister  Yashwant Sinha replied:<p>"Nothing. They are a sovereign country. They have tested  their missiles. Good luck to them."<p>He added that "from India there is no danger of escalation  or conflict," although he repeated charges against Pakistan  that it was sponsoring "cross-border terrorism" by supporting  Islamic militants fighting Indian rule in the disputed Kashmir  region.<p>The threat of war between the neighbors has receded since  June when tensions were at their height.<p>However, verbal sparring between the rivals has intensified  in recent weeks as India accused Pakistan of undermining its  Kashmir elections by encouraging Islamic militants to step up  their violent campaign against Indian rule.<p>Islamabad has denied the charge, and blamed Indian  intelligence for sponsoring violence in Pakistan.<p>More than 600 people have been killed in Indian-controlled  Kashmir since early August, when state elections were  announced. Islamic militants stormed a polling booth Tuesday in  the fourth and final round of voting, killing two soldiers.<p>The United States criticized both countries for last week's  tests, saying they could encourage a nuclear missile and arms  race in the region.</span>
