BERLIN, April 13 &#0151; Thousands of demonstrators marched in German cities today to protest Israeli incursions into the West Bank. 
<P> In Berlin, marchers threw cobblestones at the windows of the British Embassy, and the police charged them with batons and pepper spray.</P> <P> Demonstrations of more than 5,000 people in both Frankfurt and D&#0252;sseldorf were reportedly peaceful, and the police and local university organizers in Berlin described the violence as a minor disruption of a relatively peaceful gathering. Smaller demonstrations were reported in many other German cities. </P> <P> In Berlin, more than 11,000 demonstrators marched in the city's center waving Palestinian flags and placards with messages like "Stop the Genocide in Palestine" and "The axis of evil: Sharon, Bush and Fischer," referring to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, who was seen by some marchers as pro-Israel.</P> <P> There were demonstrations in other European cities, wire services reported. In London, 15,000 people marched though the center of the city to protest the Israeli offensive. In Amsterdam, a similar demonstration by an estimated 10,000 marchers turned violent when protesters clashed with the police. There were also demonstrations in France, Corsica and Istanbul.</P> <P> Vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans at a Jewish cemetery in Strasbourg, France, the police said today. There has been a series of anti-Semitic attacks in France in recent weeks.</P> <P> The Berlin demonstration took a route that passed by the American and British Embassies and the site of a planned Holocaust memorial. At both embassies, organizers confronted protesters throwing stones, and many demonstrators pleaded for a peaceful demonstration.</P> <P> A demonstration in support of Israel was scheduled for Sunday.</P> <P> Protesters shouting "God is Great!" and "Sharon is a child murderer!" also carried pictures of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. </P> <P> Anna Lemberg, 21, a student at Free University in Berlin and press spokeswoman for the organizers, said efforts had been made to keep militant groups away. "We went to the mosques and asked that radical groups not show up, but we cannot stop people from voicing their opinions," she said.</P> <P> She described the marches as largely successful. "The numbers speak for themselves," she said. "We wanted to bring the people into the streets to protest German weapon exports and support of Sharon." </P> <P> The German government has traditionally given strong support to Israel, but recently a number of politicians have questioned Israeli policies. Ms. Lemberg insisted that the demonstration's criticism of Israeli policies should not be construed as anti-Semitism.</P> <P> Many of the demonstrators, including many Muslims living in Germany, made it clear that they were not out to protest against the German government. Abul Aynan, a Palestinian refugee, and his friend Roberto, a Lebanese-German citizen who declined to give his last name, marched with Palestinian and Hezbollah flags. </P> <P> "I love Germany," said Roberto, who said he las lived in Germany for 12 years. "I am raising two children here." He said he attended to protest against Israel. "In a fight against Jews, I will be there."</P> <P> Many of the protesters, marching near buildings associated with the Nazi terror, sought to draw awkward comparisons between World War II and the Israeli incursions into the West Bank and Gaza.</P> <P> Two students of economics at Berlin universities, Nicole Bading, a 23-year-old German, and Nader Hamamreh, a 30-year-old Palestinian, held aloft a placard in front of the site of the planned Holocaust memorial that read: "The Holocaust must never be repeated!! Palestinians are also human."</P> <P> Mr. Hamamreh said, "The Palestinians are living in a large concentration camp." He said his comment was metaphorical.</P>
