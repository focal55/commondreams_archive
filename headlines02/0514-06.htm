<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - An e-mail from a high-ranking staff member of the Bush 
administration's energy task force said officials were "desperately trying to 
avoid California" in a report dealing with the energy crisis last year, Rep. 
Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, said Monday.
<P>The e-mail, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by watchdog and 
environmental groups and also provided to Waxman, was largely redacted, and 
neither administration officials nor the congressman could say specifically 
what the task force staffer was discussing.
<P>But Waxman seized on the missive to turn the heat up on the White House to 
release all documents relating to the task force's discussions about 
California's energy crisis.
<P>Waxman said the e-mail, along with the recent release of documents showing 
Enron sought to manipulate the California energy market, "underscores the need 
for the administration to provide a complete accounting of its understanding 
of and approach to the energy crisis."
<P>The e-mail was sent May 4, 2001, by Karen Knutson, deputy director of the 
energy task force, to Jacob Moss of the Environmental Protection Agency. It 
raised concerns about putting into the report a paragraph "emphasizing 
environmentally difficult issues about expediting permitting to deal with a 
crisis."
<P>"We are desperately trying to avoid California in this report as much as 
possible," the e-mail continues. "Can you make the same point without going 
into California . . ."
<P>Knutson could not be reached for comment, and administration officials 
could not immediately say what it was about California that she sought to keep 
out of the report. But they defended their actions on California's energy 
crisis.
<P>"Congressman Waxman has confused the Bush administration with the lack 
of action taken by the Clinton administration," Energy Department spokeswoman 
Jeanne Lopatto said. She said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, on 
Bush's watch, had imposed electricity price controls and begun an 
investigation into whether Enron and other power sellers sought to use their 
market power to drive up prices.
<P>The task force report released last year actually features California 
prominently, using the state's problems to bolster its arguments for building 
more power plants.
<P>Waxman said the e-mail raised questions about whether the widespread 
deletion of information from thousands of pages of documents turned over by 
federal agencies was the result of the administration's claims that disclosure 
would chill frank and open discussion or was intended to avoid embarrassment.
<P>Waxman's letter was the latest salvo in a yearlong effort by congressional 
Democrats to force the administration to make public details of private 
meetings held with lobbyists during drafting of the energy plan.
<P>The battle was fired up last week with the release of internal Enron memos 
that detailed an array of Enron price-manipulation strategies. Two Senate 
committees plan hearings on the memos Wednesday.</p>
