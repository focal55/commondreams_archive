WASHINGTON, April 10 &#0151; Energy Department officials gave 11 environmental groups just 48 hours to submit their policy proposals for consideration in Vice President Dick Cheney's national energy report last year, a batch of documents released today indicate.
<P> Energy Department officials say, however, that the groups had other opportunities for comment.</P>
<P> 
The request for recommendations was sent by e-mail in March 2001 after Mr. Cheney's national task force had consulted with dozens of energy executives to help formulate a national energy policy. Leaders of environmental groups have long complained that the White House did not extend to them the same courtesy given to energy corporations that had made large donations to the Republican Party to help elect President Bush and Mr. Cheney in 2000.
<P> The groups have said that Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham met with 109 representatives of the energy industry and trade associations but no environmental groups from late January to May 17, 2001, when the report was released.</P>
<P> In a March 21, 2001, e-mail message that appears to substantiate those complaints, a senior department official instructs a colleague to telephone 11 environmental groups to compile "energy policy options they are advocating." </P>
<P> "Can you then review the proposals and recommend some we might like to support that are consistent with the administration energy statements to date?" the official, Margot Andersen, wrote to another staff member, Peter Karpoff.</P>
<P> The e-mail message was sent at 12:49 p.m. on Wednesday, March 21, 2001. "Need by Friday noon," Ms. Andersen wrote to Mr. Karpoff.</P>
<P> The 11 groups listed are: the Alliance to Save Energy, Environmental Defense, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the Sierra Club, the World Resources Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, the Wind Energy Association, the Tellus Institute and Resources for the Future.</P>
<P> Mr. Karpoff then struggled to reach several of the groups, some of which later complained that none of their recommendations appeared in the report.</P>
<P> Jill Schroeder, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said the 48-hour time frame discussed in the e-mail message was not the only opportunity extended to environmental groups to submit their opinions.</P>
<P> "We did reach out to environmental groups," Ms. Schroeder said. "We incorporated a lot of their recommendations into the energy policy. To say that this was the only contact with environmentalists is short-sighted."</P>
<P> Jeanne Lopatto, another Energy Department spokeswoman, said environmental groups had met with other agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, to make recommendations on the national energy report. She said it was unfair to conclude from one or two e-mail messages that environmentalists had been shut out of the process.</P>
<P> "This is not an accurate portrayal of a process that spans many weeks and many agencies," Ms. Lopatto said.</P>
<P> Environmental groups acknowledged talking to other departments but contended that they had little access to officials at the Energy Department, which was largely responsible for the task force report.</P>
<P> "Because of the quick turnaround, there wasn't a meaningful opportunity to provide input into or have influence over the task force's recommendations," said Sharon Buccino, senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The administration has represented this was a balanced process and a balanced product. The documents don't support that."</P>
<P> The e-mail message and Mr. Karpoff's handwritten notes of conversations with environmental groups were included in 950 pages of documents related to work on Mr. Cheney's energy task force that were released today by the Energy Department. Judicial Watch, a public interest law firm here, and the Natural Resources Defense Council had sued the Energy Department for all documents related to the formulation of the energy policy.</P>
<P> "The documents show that the Energy Department was more interested in the views of energy industry executives than the views of environmental groups," said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch.</P>
<P> Mr. Fitton said his group had expected the Energy Department to release thousands more documents today. He estimated that 14,000 pages of Energy Department documents related to the task force have still not been released. </P>
<P> The Energy Department has claimed a variety of privileges to withhold the documents; most have been withheld because administration lawyers say they deal with internal policy deliberations.</P>
<P> Mr. Fitton said Judicial Watch intended to ask a judge next month to order the department to release most of the remaining documents.</P>
