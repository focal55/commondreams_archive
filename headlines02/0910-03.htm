<p> UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 9 &#0151; Senior Canadian and European officials, openly 
expressing their frustration with Washington's objections to the International 
Criminal Court, pledged today to work to extend its jurisdiction worldwide.</p>
<P> As expectations heightened here of the speech President Bush will make Thursday 
to rally support against Iraq, the differences over the court between the United 
States and some of its closest allies were conspicuous.</p>
<P> While Mr. Bush met in Detroit this morning with Prime Minister Jean Chr&#0233;tien 
of Canada to seek his support for a confrontation with Iraq, Canada's foreign 
minister, Bill Graham, was here chastising the United States for its "ad hoc and 
often unilateral pursuit" of the prosecution of crimes against humanity.</p>
<P> As he reassured "democratic, law-abiding states that they have nothing to 
fear" from the court, Mr. Graham warned that the United States' lack of faith 
in it could erode the faith of other countries in American justice.</p>
<P> Officials from Germany, Italy and the European Union also said they would 
move ahead on expanding the range and legitimacy of the court. </p>
<P> The Bush administration, citing fears that American soldiers or political 
leaders could face politically motivated prosecution, withdrew the United States' 
signature from the treaty creating the court and has sought bilateral agreements 
from countries around the world to exempt American citizens from its reach.</p>
<P> Officials from the United Nations and countries supporting the court have 
said the Bush administration's efforts could undermine the court's credibility, 
crippling its ability to detain war criminals for trial.</p>
<P> The session today was part of the first organizing assembly for the new court, 
and representatives of the nations that ratified the treaty by July 2 were invited. 
By that date, 76 states had ratified the treaty, bringing it into force much more 
quickly than many nations, including the United States, expected. It is expected 
to go to work next spring. </p>
<P> None of the speakers today directly called for nations to spurn Washington's 
overtures. But they made it clear that they thought the American tactics were 
unnecessary.</p>
<P> Many speakers said they thought the best way to convince the Bush administration 
was by helping the court to get started prosecuting major human rights crimes 
"in a fair, competent and effective manner," in the words of Lene Espersen, the 
justice minister of Denmark, who spoke for the European Union.</p>
<P> Last week the organizing assembly approved a budget of $39.37 million through 
2003 and rules for electing 18 judges and a prosecutor. The rules were intended 
to ensure that recognized professional jurists would be chosen for the bench, 
avoiding nominations based on political patronage. Diplomats also built in a requirement 
that governments cast half their votes for women among the candidates. </p>
<P> The assembly also adopted descriptions of the human rights crimes to be prosecuted. 
United States delegates had agreed to those descriptions in a series of meetings 
since 1998, when the treaty was completed. </p>
<P> But Washington's pressure has worked with several countries, slowing the court's 
progress. Colombia, the world's third largest recipient of American aid for its 
war against leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers, 
opted for a treaty provision exempting it for seven years from war crimes prosecutions 
under the court. The Philippines has also delayed ratifying the treaty.</p>
<P> But the representative from East Timor, a young nation that was reported to 
have signed an agreement with the United States, said today &#0151; in an unmistakably 
defensive tone &#0151; that the measure was still under debate by its Parliament. 
</p>
<P> Some of the United States' most important friends were the most blunt today.</p>
<P> Invoking the example of the trials of Nazi war criminals, J&#0252;rgen Chrobog, 
a senior Foreign Ministry official from Germany, said the American concerns about 
the new court were unfounded. He pointed out that under the treaty, national courts 
take precedence, so if governments conscientiously prosecute war crimes by their 
own citizens, the international court would not have jurisdiction to take over 
those cases.</p>
