<p>WASHINGTON --
The Senate abruptly scaled back plans to boost global AIDS relief this 
year after the White House urged key Republicans to withdraw their support.
<P>The unanticipated development came just as Congress appeared on the verge 
of spending historic amounts to fight the deadly pandemic, which has infected 
4.5 million children and kills 5,000 people each day in Africa alone.

Hours before a vote Thursday on a $500 million AIDS proposal, White 
House budget director Mitch Daniels persuaded the measure's author, Republican 
Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, to reduce it by 60 percent.
<P>White House aides said President Bush would make his own announcement over 
the next few weeks to establish his commitment to the issue, but supporters of 
AIDS relief expressed doubts it would approach the level abandoned by the 
Senate Republicans.
<P>"Do we have any faith that the White House will make up for it? No," said 
Paul Zeitz, executive director of Global AIDS Alliance.
<P>Bush has proposed steady increases in AIDS funds, but his requests have not 
kept pace with the appetite of many lawmakers, including those from his own 
party. Support for fighting the disease reached critical mass this year on 
Capitol Hill, where, after years of more modest allocations, an unusual 
alliance of Republicans and Democrats made dramatic spending increases appear 
likely.
<P>More than 36 million people in the world today have HIV, the virus that 
causes AIDS, and 95 percent of those live in developing countries, according 
to a United Nations report. AIDS already has surpassed the plague, which 
ravaged medieval Europe, as the world's No. 1 killer.
<P><b>SOME RECENT UNLIKELY ALLIES</b>
<P>Jolted particularly by the number of mother-to-child transmissions in 
Africa, longtime opponents of AIDS relief have joined the crusade. One former 
opponent, Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, noted that at age 81, 
he is "mindful of soon meeting" his maker and confessed recently that he was 
"ashamed that I had not done more."
<P>Helms and Frist, a close ally of Bush, joined forces to propose a half-
billion-dollar addition to the emergency terror bill now before Congress to 
supplement the $750 million already being spent on international AIDS this 
year.
<P>But Thursday afternoon, after several conversations with Daniels, Frist 
stunned his colleagues by announcing that he no longer supported his own $500 
million proposal and planned to scale it back to $200 million.
<P>Democratic efforts to push the measure without the support of Frist and 
Helms, who is recuperating in the hospital from heart surgery but went along 
with his Republican colleague, failed by a 49-46 vote. Eight Democrats joined 
41 Republicans voting against it.
<P>"It's a bait and switch," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who like many 
of her colleagues assumed the Senate would approve at least $500 million in 
relief and perhaps as much as $700 million.
<P>Had she known that Frist, the only physician in the Senate, and Helms would 
pull their support at the 11th hour, "I would have organized my colleagues. I 
would have done something," Boxer said.
<P>The $200 million in AIDS spending approved by the Senate was part of a $31.
5 billion emergency bill directed mostly at providing money as soon as 
possible to combat terrorism. The Republicans' decision came amid a veto 
threat by Bush, who said the price tag on the terror bill was too steep. The 
spending bill isn't confined to terrorism measures, however, and includes $2 
million to store animal specimens at the Smithsonian and $2.5 million to map 
the Hawaiian coral reef.
<P>Aides to Frist and Helms said they agreed to drop their support of the more 
costly AIDS measure only after being assured by the White House that Bush 
would unveil a "comparable" plan to combat international AIDS, perhaps as 
early as next week.
<P>"We're going to end up at the same place by taking another route," said 
Frist spokeswoman Margaret Camp.
<P>"We feel very good about it. It's vastly better to have the president's 
support," said Helms' spokesman, Lester Munson.
<P><b>$100 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS
</b>
<P>Several sources on Capitol Hill and among AIDS activists said the Bush plan 
would include $100 million a year in additional AIDS funds for each of five 
years starting in 2004, which would fall far short of the Helms-Frist plan.
<P>White House spokesman Ken Lisaius said Helms and Frist are "working closely 
with the president" on the White House proposal, but he did not divulge any 
details or dollar amounts.
<P>The change drew charges of betrayal from advocates who said they have no 
reason to believe the White House will follow through on its commitment.
<P>"In no way do I believe that there is a deal or agreement I can accept," 
said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, one of Washington's most vocal advocates for 
increased spending to fight AIDS. "This was a real jolt. As we address the 
challenges of 9/11, we must not forget there are other challenges that affect 
the lives of millions of people."
<P>Boxer said, "We had an opportunity to be a real world leader on this, and 
we blew it."</p>
