Having led the nation in divesting from South Africa and helping bring 
an end to apartheid, the Berkeley City Council tonight will consider clearing 
the city's portfolio of investments in Israel and Palestinian territory in an 
attempt to bring peace to the Middle East.
<P>The ambitious plan also calls on City Hall to boycott firms doing business 
with Israel and the Palestinians and would prohibit the purchase of products 
made there. Backers believe it would make Berkeley the first city to boycott 
the two sides.
<P>No one backing the proposal by the city's Peace and Justice Commission 
believes that Berkeley alone can end the violence. But they hope other cities 
will follow its lead, creating economic incentive for Jews and Palestinians to 
make peace.
<P>"Berkeley is a small city, and its economy is not going to make or break 
the Middle East," said commissioner Steve Freedkin. "But if others follow suit, it could have quite an impact."
<P>The true effect of the measure remains to be seen, as no one at City Hall 
had a clue yesterday how much money Berkeley has invested in the region, nor 
did anyone know how many contracts it holds with companies doing business with 
Israel and the Palestinians.
<P>City Manager Weldon Rucker is urging the council to delay action until May 
28 so he can answer those questions. He also wonders how the measure would be 
adopted and enforced.
<P>"Managing this thing would be a major undertaking," said Fred Medrano, who 
supervises the Peace and Justice Commission for Rucker. "The finance 
department is real concerned with its ability to implement this."
<P>If the measure is approved, every city investment and contract would have 
to be reviewed. The effect could be huge because some of the nation's biggest 
companies, including General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, AOL 
Time Warner and Microsoft do business in Israel.
<P>While there is mounting pressure on many college campuses -- including the 
University of California at Berkeley -- for universities to divest from Israel, Berkeley is unique in making targets of both Israel and the Palestinians.
<P>"We feel that all parties need to respect human rights and provide for 
peace and security in the region," Freedkin said.
<P>Although the council probably will delay deciding on divestiture, it is 
expected to embrace the commission's more mainstream proposals, including 
"supporting all efforts by individuals and groups toward a just peace in 
Israel and Palestine."
<P>Berkeley has long used its pocketbook to influence global affairs with 
varying degrees of success. Its pioneering decision to divest from South 
Africa in 1979 was widely seen as a turning point in the effort to end 
apartheid.
<P>But the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago unanimously barred Berkeley and 
other cities from boycotting Burma because the United States must speak with 
one voice in foreign affairs.
<P>In an embarrassing turn of events, the city in 1997 had to scramble to find 
a gasoline supplier when it decided to boycott Nigeria, precluding it from 
dealing with most petroleum firms.
