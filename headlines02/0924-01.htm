- A senior House Democrat on Monday warned the Bush administration and the U.S. 
oil industry against using the threat of war in Iraq as justification for opening 
an Alaskan wilderness area to oil and gas drilling.
<p>Later this week, House-Senate negotiators on a major energy  bill are expected to debate whether to open the pristine Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas development. The  idea is a centerpiece of the White House's energy policy.<p>The Republican-led House of Representatives approved the  provision, but Democrats who control the Senate rejected it as  a threat to the refuge's animal life and unnecessary if tougher  conservation methods were adopted.<p>Congress is trying to finish the energy bill this year, but  still must work out House-Senate differences on a range of  issues in addition to ANWR, including updated automobile  fuel-efficiency standards, ethanol production and climate  change provisions.<p>Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on  the House Energy panel, accused the White House of trying to  win ANWR drilling rights for oil firms by linking the issue to  potential oil disruptions if the United States attacks Iraq.<p>"We are not going to allow a declaration of war against  (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein to be used as a cover for the  Bush administration's environmental offices to declare war  against the environment," Markey said at an environmental rally  on Capitol Hill.<p>Military strikes against Iraq would cut off the nation's  roughly 2 million barrels per day of oil exports to the world  oil market. Iraq ranked as the sixth biggest foreign oil  supplier to the United States last year, although shipments  have sharply dropped in recent months.<p>Markey added that, "Right now, all over this city, are  meetings that are being conducted by oil industry executives  trying to find a way, using the cover of a potential war with  Saddam Hussein to include a provision, which allows the  drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge."<p>Markey released a letter written to the House-Senate  negotiators, signed by 110 House Democrats, calling on them to  reject any drilling in ANWR and its 19 million acres.<p>Oil industry executives have acknowledged that even if  Congress agreed to open ANWR, it would take several years for  oil to start flowing and about eight years to reach peak  production of 1 million barrels per day.<p>President Bush, during a campaign swing through New Jersey  on Monday, called on Congress to pass energy legislation this  year.<p>While he didn't mention ANWR by name, Bush said the bill  endorsed by Congress should be one that "encourages an increase  of supply here at home so we're less dependent on foreign  sources of crude oil." Bush is a former Texas oilman.<p>Interior Secretary Gale Norton recently said she would  recommend the president veto any final energy bill that fails  to include drilling in ANWR.<p>Last week, Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, the chairman of  the House Energy Committee, indicated a willingness to accept  Democratic climate change legislation in return for including  ANWR drilling in the energy bill.<p>U.S. environmental groups oppose such a tradeoff.<p>Athan Manuel, of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group,  said he thought Tauzin's idea had not gained much steam since  last week.<p>Manuel said he was more concerned about a potential "deal"  by House-Senate negotiators that would allow ANWR drilling in  return for cordoning off other Alaskan lands from development.</span>
