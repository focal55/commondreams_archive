BOGOTA, Colombia  --
The Cano Limon oil pipeline, which snakes almost 500 miles across 
northern Colombia, was once the focus of dreams for national prosperity.
<P>But after years of sabotage bombings by leftist guerrillas, the pipeline 
may serve instead as the trigger for wider U.S. involvement in Colombia's 36-
year civil war, some critics warn.

</table></font>Earlier this month, the Bush administration announced it will ask Congress 
for $98 million in the 2003 budget to train, arm and provide air support for 
Colombian troops to defend the pipeline, which is jointly owned by the 
Occidental Petroleum Corp., with headquarters in Los Angeles, and the 
Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol.
<P>The move marks a shift from previous U.S. policy of providing only military 
aid, which was reserved almost exclusively for anti-narcotics operations.
<P>U.S. officials say training a battalion of 1,000 men to guard a petroleum 
pipeline is not part of the war on terrorism but rather an effort to preserve 
Colombia's economy, which derives about one-third of its export earnings from 
oil.
<P>The pipeline is "important for the future of . . . our (U.S.) petroleum 
supplies and the confidence of our investors," said U.S. Ambassador Anne 
Patterson in a recent interview with the leading Bogota daily El Tiempo.
<P>Critics, including community leaders in towns alongside the pipeline and 
the guerrillas, say the shift will intensify the conflict in Colombia's oil-
rich northeast.
<P><b>'Counterinsurgency Plan'</b>
<P>"Plans for the United States to train an infrastructure protection 
battalion will make the conflict in this region more acute," said Samuel 
Morales, president of the Unitary Workers' Confederation in the town of 
Saravena. "The infrastructure issue is a pretext and this is a clear 
counterinsurgency plan."
<P>The pipeline began operation in 1986 and pumps around 110,000 barrels a day 
of crude oil from the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental in Arauca 
province on the border with Venezuela, to the Caribbean coastal town of 
Covenas.
<P>The 2-foot-diameter tube, buried for much of its length at depths of 6 feet,
 has been a favored target for Colombia's two largest leftist rebel forces, 
which accuse foreign multinational firms of "plundering" the nation's natural 
resources.
<P><b>Rebels Target Pipeline</b>
<P>Last year, guerrillas blew up sections of the pipeline 170 times, putting 
it out of operation for 266 days. This year it has been bombed 15 times 
already. Since 1986, there have been more than 900 such incidents and a loss 
of some 2.5 million barrels of crude -- more than nine times the amount of the 
Exxon Valdez spill.
<P>Although Cano Limon is an alternative source of oil for the United States, 
its total production hardly qualifies it to be considered strategically 
important.
<P>In 2001, Colombia produced 600,000 barrels a day and its exports accounted 
for less than 2 percent of total U.S. oil needs. Even within Occidental's 
worldwide portfolio, the Cano Limon field comprises less than 5 percent of its 
global production.
<P>But oil is essential to the health of Colombia's economy. The government 
estimated that last year's record bombing campaign against the pipeline shaved 
half a percentage point off the gross domestic product.
<P>The Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second-
largest rebel force, began its offensive against the pipeline even before it 
was built, demanding multimillion-dollar payoffs to allow the project to be 
completed ahead of schedule.
<P>More recently, the far larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
has taken the lead in bombings, apparently in an effort to back its own hefty 
extortion demands.
<P>"We have been told to bomb at will and keep the pipeline out of action," 
said a FARC fighter, who gave his name only as Javier, outside a town close to 
the pipeline.
<P>Javier said he and his team, traveling on motorbikes or bicycles, plant 25-
pound bombs made of dynamite and a fertilizer mixture -- a low-tech device 
that is cheap to produce but extremely effective.
<P>In a 1993 document, the FARC leadership laid out its demands for state 
ownership and control of strategic economic sectors, including the oil 
industry, and asked that contracts with multinational companies be rescinded 
or renegotiated. The ELN maintains a similar stance.
<P>FARC commanders have predictably condemned the new U.S. proposal.
<P>"This is one of a series of measures to increase American involvement in 
Colombia's war," said Andres Paris, a member of the FARC negotiating team 
involved in peace talks with the government. "The best way of protecting oil 
is to develop and protect the state oil sector."
<P>Former U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette rejects such arguments. He believes 
Washington wants to broaden its focus beyond counter-narcotics to prop up the 
fragile central government, which has been unable to prevent the rebel armies 
from gaining control of about 40 percent of the country.
<P>"It's not exactly counterinsurgency," he said. "But either with or without 
American help, Colombia must extend the authority and presence of the state."
<P>Using troops to protect Colombia's energy infrastructure is nothing new. 
Between 10 percent and 15 percent of the army's total combat force is said to 
be deployed alongside oil pipelines and other key facilities.
<P>Foreign oil companies, including Occidental and BP-Amoco, make regular 
contributions for their own protection through donations to the Finance 
Ministry that are then channeled to the military.
<P>But as last year's surge in pipeline attacks demonstrates, their largesse 
has produced few results.</p>
