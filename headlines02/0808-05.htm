<p>WASHINGTON -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told regional government officials 
that he aims to thwart any U.S. invasion by avoiding open desert fighting and 
massing his military in major cities where civilian and American casualties would 
be highest, current and former U.S. intelligence officials say.
<p>In meetings in recent weeks, the U.S. officials say, Hussein has outlined a 
strategy that appears to center on drawing U.S. forces into Baghdad and other 
urban settings where his equipment and troops would not be as exposed to America's 
warplanes and high-tech weaponry.
<p>Hussein's statements have been relayed to U.S. intelligence operatives through 
Iraqi defectors and opposition groups in contact with officials in Hussein's ruling 
Baath party.
<p> Hussein did not discuss detailed strategy in the sessions, intelligence sources 
said, but directed the officials to be prepared for urban fighting.
<p>His planning appears to be driven partly by lessons from the 1991 Persian Gulf 
War--in which Iraqi tanks and other equipment were easily destroyed in the open 
desert by American aircraft--and by the significant erosion of Iraq's military 
capability since then.
<p>Urban fighting is one of the most daunting scenarios U.S. military planners 
face. Baghdad in particular is a sprawling setting, where Hussein's forces would 
have significant advantages.
<p>Military targets in Baghdad are sprinkled among a population approaching 5 
million. Hussein has constructed an elaborate warren of underground bunkers and 
escape routes. U.S. soldiers would probably have to slog through Baghdad's streets 
wearing chemical-weapons suits and carrying extra equipment.
<p>The signals from Hussein come as the White House appears to be moving forward 
with plans for war. President Bush and his national security team were briefed 
on several options Monday by Gen. Tommy Franks, head of U.S. Central Command. 
Reportedly among them was a so-called inside-out plan in which the United States 
would strike Baghdad first in an attempt to decapitate Iraq's military capability 
and cause a collapse of the regime.
<p>Given Hussein's signals and the evolving direction of U.S. plans, military 
analysts said it appears increasingly likely that any U.S. invasion would involve 
significant urban fighting.
<p>"It's almost a foregone conclusion," said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst 
at the Brookings Institution. Hussein "won't fight out in the desert."
<p>But if the strategic outlines are starting to emerge, experts and intelligence 
officials said it is extremely difficult to calculate how urban fighting in Iraq 
would play out.
<p>U.S. defense and intelligence officials acknowledge that they don't know where 
Hussein is hiding many of his chemical and biological weapons, let alone how he 
might use them in a pitched battle for Baghdad.
<p>Experts also say it is difficult to assess how long it would take for U.S. 
forces to seize Baghdad, partly because it's hard to know how long Hussein's elite 
troops and intelligence agencies would remain loyal in the face of an American 
siege.
<p>Bush on Wednesday promised to be "patient and deliberate" in considering options 
concerning Iraq but signaled that the United States remains committed to toppling 
a dictator accused of developing weapons of mass destruction and supporting terrorism.
<p>"These are real threats, and we owe it to our children to deal with these threats," 
Bush said in a speech at Madison Central High School in Madison, Miss.
<p><b>White House Debate</b>
<p>The question of how the U.S. deals with those threats has prompted a fierce 
debate within the administration.
<p>A number of Pentagon planning documents have been leaked in recent months outlining 
options ranging from an Afghanistan-style mix of air attacks and Special Forces 
maneuvers to an all-out invasion by as many as 250,000 U.S. troops.
<p>Amid this saber-rattling, members of the Iraqi parliament vowed Wednesday to 
resist a U.S. invasion, and Hussein is scheduled to deliver a nationally televised 
address today to anxious citizens.
<p>Hussein's comments on a defensive strategy represent the first indication of 
how he intends to respond to any U.S. attack. A former U.S. intelligence official 
said he was told of Hussein's comments during recent meetings with Iraqi dissidents 
and opposition groups in London. A U.S. defense intelligence official said American 
intelligence has collected similar information and considers it reliable.
<p>Another U.S. intelligence official said he could not confirm accounts of Hussein's 
meetings and was skeptical that such information would find its way out of the 
country. But he said an attempt to force the United States into urban fighting 
"is the best of a bunch of bad options" for the Iraqi dictator if the U.S. invades.
<p>The current and former intelligence officials spoke on condition they not be 
identified.
<p>Hussein's apparent aim is to "force the Americans to come in and create a lot 
of collateral damage, which will get the international community to get in and 
stop the fighting," the former intelligence official said.
<p>Many European and Arab leaders, including U.S. allies, are urging the United 
States not to invade Iraq.
<p><b>The Domestic Factor</b>
<p>Hussein also apparently believes that urban fighting "will inflict heavy casualties 
on the Americans," eroding U.S. support at home, the former official said.
<p>America pulled out of Somalia after 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in fierce 
street fighting in Mogadishu in 1993. The fighting was dramatized in the 2001 
movie "Black Hawk Down."
<p>Pentagon officials said it might not be necessary for U.S. troops to enter 
Baghdad and engage in street fighting. Rather, advances in precision-guided weapons 
could enable the United States to hit almost any important target by air. And 
if Hussein holes up in one of his many bunkers, they said, U.S. forces could choke 
off the city and wait him out.
<p>One complication for military planners is assessing the allegiance of Iraqi 
troops, particularly the elite Republican Guard.
<p>"I don't think Hussein would survive long," said a former CIA official with 
extensive experience in the region. "But that's the problem: We don't know what 
the breaking point is for his supporters. Does a solid month of B-52 strikes do 
it, or do we need people on the ground?"
<p>Some former Iraqi military officials insist that Hussein's regime would crumble 
quickly.
<p>Former Gen. Najib Salhi, who defected in 1995, said in a recent interview that 
Hussein's forces would turn on him the moment U.S. troops started to roll toward 
Baghdad.
<p>"Only a few hundred will stay loyal to Saddam until the last minute," Salhi 
said. "Everybody in Iraq will be against him.... It's going to be a big collapse, 
like a building demolished with dynamite."
<p>But military experts said the United States can't afford to count on that and 
that airstrikes may not be adequate to seize the city. Hussein survived bombing 
of his hiding spots during the Gulf War, and the U.S. may not be willing to wait 
out a desperate dictator with chemical weapons.
<p>"I don't have a sense that &#91;Hussein's&#93; various praetorian guard formations 
are guerrillas or house-to-house fighters," said John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org, 
an independent defense policy group. "But if the thing does not spontaneously 
fly apart, and if it does turn out there are substantial numbers of armed people 
prepared to resist, it could be real nasty."
<p>It's possible, Pike said, "that it takes a week for U.S. forces to get from 
Kuwait to the west side of Baghdad, then three months to get to the east side 
of Baghdad."
<p><b>A Postwar Decline</b>
<p>Iraq's capabilities have eroded significantly since the end of the Gulf War.
<p>Hussein has been unable to maintain much of the machinery used to fight the 
war because Iraq relied on foreign technical experts to service its French and 
Russian aircraft and other equipment.
<p>Morale is so low that regular army troops would probably defect in large numbers, 
leaving only a corps of 100,000 Republican Guards defending Hussein, defector 
Salhi said.
<p>Yet Iraq retains the most formidable military in the Persian Gulf, with 424,000 
men, 2,200 tanks, 3,700 other armored vehicles and 2,400 artillery pieces, according 
to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
<p>Perhaps half its 316 combat aircraft remain capable of carrying out missions.
<p>Military analysts consider it likely that U.S. soldiers would face chemical 
or biological weapons if they fought an urban battle in Baghdad, because Hussein 
would have little to lose.
<p>In the 1980s, he killed thousands of Kurds and Iranians with chemical weapons. 
His forces dispersed chemical weapons during the Gulf War but did not deliver 
them, according to a CIA report.
<p>"He will not hesitate to use these weapons," said Salhi, adding that Hussein's 
storage and delivery of such weapons left them unreliable.
<p>Iraq has planes equipped with chemical "sprayer" tanks and has experimented 
with unmanned planes that CIA officials believe have been modified to disperse 
chemical or biological agents.
<p>A United Nations report has concluded that Iraq may have hidden as many as 
6,000 chemical weapons from U.N. weapons inspectors.
<p>"The end result is likely to be that Iraq would succeed in launching some &#91;weapons 
of mass destruction&#93; strikes against U.S. coalition forces, targets in neighboring 
states, and/or Israel," Anthony H. Cordesman, a military strategist at the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, concluded in a recent study of military 
options against Iraq. </p>
