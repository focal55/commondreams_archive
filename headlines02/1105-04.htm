<p>FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. - In an unprecedented mobilization in the world's oldest 
democracy, hundreds of election observers have arrived in Florida to monitor today's 
voting to prevent a repeat of the disputed counts during the 2000 presidential 
election and the gubernatorial primary in September. 
<P> Monitors from a national coalition of nonpartisan organizations, including 
the NAACP and People for the American Way Foundation, have already canvassed neighborhoods 
in dozens of Broward County precincts in south Florida, distributing voter's rights 
material in Spanish, Haitian Creole, and English. 
<P> Yesterday, frustrated observers scribbled notes as voters casting early ballots 
waited in line for three to four hours in the Broward suburb of Lauderhill. A 
day of training for some monitors in Fort Lauderdale lasted into the night. 
<P> This morning, the coalition's 1,000 observers, wearing black and white T-shirts 
and carrying cellphones, are set to stand outside polling places in six counties 
across Florida, while hundreds of lawyers wait at telephone hot lines to handle 
complaints. 
<P> The Center for Democracy, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that has monitored 
elections in developing democracies such as Guatemala and Russia, was contracted 
by Miami-Dade officials to observe voting in that county. The organization was 
paid $92,000 to send 20 people to observe election preparations, mediate between 
voters and polling officials, and evaluate the overall process. 
<P> ''What is unusual about this is that so many organizations have come together 
to do individual elements of this election protection program,'' said Ralph G. 
Neas, president of the People for the American Way Foundation. ''It is a direct 
response to the debacle in Florida'' in 2000. 
<P> The Justice Department also has sent monitors to Miami-Dade and Broward counties 
at the request of Florida's secretary of state, Jim Smith, a Republican. 
<P> In Miami-Dade, the prosecutor's office plans to send 20 teams of lawyers to 
look for voting irregularities. The county granted permission for a group of monitors 
from Eastern Europe who are affiliated with the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, to observe the voting. 
<P> ''We are transparent; we have nothing to hide in this process,'' said Dennis 
Moss, a Miami-Dade commissioner who heads a county task force that is working 
with the Center for Democracy. ''What I hope will happen as a result of having 
all of these groups here is that they will help validate the fact that we will 
run a successful election. It will bring us credibility from our citizens, the 
community at large, and the country.'' 
<P> A coalition of 20 national organizations led by the People for the American 
Way Foundation has also mobilized nonpartisan monitors in Miami-Dade, Broward, 
Palm Beach, Orange, Leon, and Duvall counties. 
<P> Moss said each Miami-Dade precinct will have three county employees to help 
with technical issues with the new touch-screen voting machines and with voter 
registration disputes. 
<P> Not all the election observers are nonpartisan. Officials said the state expected 
a record number of Democratic and Republican observers. 
<P> ''This is unprecedented to have so many independent monitors in a local or 
national election,'' said Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, president of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Greater Miami. 
<P> The monitors are to ensure that Florida's election reforms are followed through, 
said Rodriguez-Taseff, adding that the Justice Department will also ensure that 
balloting is executed in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole. 
<P> The ACLU led the push for outside monitors, but Rodriguez-Taseff said the 
Center for Democracy and possibly the Justice Department will have access to polling 
sites. 
<P> Sharon Lettman-Pacheco, a monitor from Florida, said the coalition's monitors 
will stand outside the polls, ready to answer voters' questions about election 
rules. 
<P> ''It's unusual that this is happening in America,'' said Lettman-Pacheco, 
deputy field director for People for the American Way Foundation. ''I cannot believe 
that we are acting like we never voted before. I have said this every day since 
the elections in 2000.'' 
<P> She said monitors will try to make sure voters have the right information 
before leaving the polls. Poll workers sometimes tell voters they cannot vote 
without identification, she said. 
<P> ''We will say, `No, all you have to do is to say who you are and sign an affidavit,''' 
Lettman-Pacheco said. ''That eases the potential of that voter not coming back 
because someone stretched out the law and said they have to have a photo identification.'' 
<P> Monitors got a preview yesterday of what lies ahead in Broward, as hundreds 
of early voters waited for hours to cast their ballots. 
<P> Lettman-Pacheco said she was frustrated to see so many people wait, but voters 
said they were happy to see Floridians, especially members of minority groups, 
coming out to vote. 
<P> ''We are happy to see such a long line,'' said Ollie Turner, who entered Lauderhill 
Mall with her husband. They said that because of the long line they would return 
on Election Day. 
<P> Marvin Ives, a music teacher who was waiting to vote at the mall, said it 
was important that Floridians exercise their right to vote despite previous election 
problems, but he was more pleased to know that so many monitors would be observing 
the process this year. 
<P> ''Given what took place in 2000, these monitors are essential,'' Ives said.</p>
