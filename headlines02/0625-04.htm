<p> KANSAS CITY, Mo. — After finishing her 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. shift, Verette Richardson 
clocked out and was heading to her car when a <org idsrc="NYSE" value="WMT">Wal-Mart</org> 
manager ordered her to turn around and straighten up the store's apparel department.</p>
<P> Eager not to get on her boss's bad side, she said, she spent the next hour 
working unpaid, tidying racks of slacks and blouses and picking up hangers and 
clothes that had fallen to the floor. Other times after clocking out, she was 
ordered to round up shopping carts in the parking lot.</p>
<P> Some days, as soon as she walked in a manager told her to rush to a cash register 
and start ringing up purchases, without clocking in. Sometimes, she said, she 
worked for three hours before clocking in. </p>
<P> "They wanted us to do a lot of work for no pay," said Ms. Richardson, who 
worked from 1995 to 2000 at a Wal-Mart in southeast Kansas City. "A company that 
makes billions of dollars doesn't have to do that." </p>
<P> But she and 40 other current and former Wal-Mart workers interviewed over 
the last four months say Wal-Mart has done just that, forcing or pressuring employees 
to work hours that were not recorded or paid. Federal and state laws bar employers 
from making hourly employees work unpaid hours. Wal-Mart's policies forbid such 
work. But many current and former workers and managers said an intense focus on 
cost cutting had created an unofficial policy that encouraged managers to request 
or require off-the-clock work and avoid paying overtime.</p>
<P> Accusations like these are at the heart of a wide-ranging legal battle between 
Wal-Mart and employees or former employees in 28 states. In class-action and individual 
lawsuits, workers assert that these practices have helped Wal-Mart undersell the 
competition, push up profits and become the world's largest retailer.</p>
<P> In the process, these lawsuits contend, the company has cheated Wal-Mart employees 
and workers at its warehouse-store division, Sam's Club, out of hundreds of millions 
of dollars a year.</p>
<P> Wal-Mart officials insist that the off-the-clock phenomenon is minimal considering 
that the company has 3,250 stores and a million employees in the United States. 
The officials say the company, based in Bentonville, Ark., has a strong policy 
against such work, a policy that is spelled out in the handbook distributed to 
every employee.</p>
<P> "Off-the-clock work is an infrequent and isolated problem, which we correct 
whenever we become aware of it," said William Wertz, a Wal-Mart spokesman. "It 
is Wal-Mart's policy to pay its employees properly for the hours they work."</p>
<P> Mr. Wertz said managers who required or requested off-the-clock work were 
subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal.</p>
<P> Two years ago, Wal-Mart paid $50 million to settle a class-action suit that 
asserted that 69,000 current and former Wal-Mart employees in Colorado had worked 
off the clock. </p>
<P> But legal papers and interviews with workers suggest that the off-the-clock 
problems go far beyond Colorado. In depositions and in interviews with The New 
York Times, Wal-Mart employees in 18 states described these types of off-the-clock 
work:</p>
<P> 
<ul>
<li>Former employees at stores in California, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Oregon 
and Washington said that many evenings when their stores closed, managers locked 
the front door and prevented workers — even those who had clocked out — from leaving 
until everyone finished straightening the store. Workers said these lock-ins, 
which aim to prevent theft, forced many employees to work an hour or two unpaid 
and enraged parents whose school-age children worked at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart officials 
acknowledged that employees were sometimes locked in but said the policy was to 
pay workers for every hour they were. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Employees at stores in six states said managers ordered them to clock out 
after their eight-hour shifts and then continue working.<br>
<br>
"We worked off the clock pretty much every shift," said Shannon Snyder, who worked 
two years ago stocking the health and beauty aids department at a Wal-Mart in 
Paso Robles, Calif. "The manager said if our jobs were not finished, we had to 
clock out and finish our jobs so no overtime would show up.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Some employees said they frequently took it upon themselves to clock out after 
their regular shift and then return to work, with their managers' knowledge and 
approval. They said they feared that if they did not finish their daily tasks 
before going home, they would be written up or fired. <br>
<br>
"You have to accomplish your job for that day," said Charlotte Johnson, who worked 
at Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs in Georgia, Oklahoma and California for a decade 
before retiring this year. "If you don't finish it, you're more or less in hot 
water with your manager."<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>A dozen Wal-Mart workers, including four in the payroll department, said managers 
deleted hours from employee timecards to avoid paying overtime. Wal-Mart officials 
said the company strictly forbade this practice and disciplined managers who did 
it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<P> Several current Wal-Mart employees said that despite the lawsuits, the problems 
continue. Alan Peto, who works at a Sam's Club in Las Vegas, said he worked off 
the clock several times each week while overseeing the electronics and hardware 
departments several years ago.</p>
<P> "They give you a lot of work to do, and there is no possible way to do that 
in the seven and a half or eight hours you've been assigned," he said. "So you 
feel pressure to clock out and do what you need to do."</p>
<P> <b>Rewarding the Cost-Cutter</b></p>
<P> Although company policy prohibits off-the-clock work, Wal-Mart has created 
a system of rewards and punishments that critics say gives managers strong incentives 
to demand such work.</p>
<P> Under one bedrock policy, described in a deposition by a senior payroll executive, 
store managers are ordered to keep payroll costs below a target that headquarters 
sets for every store. If a store misses its target, several former executives 
said, the store manager faces a reprimand and sometimes demotion or dismissal.</p>
<P> Another policy strongly discourages overtime pay. A Wal-Mart handbook says 
managers are not to schedule workers for overtime, and several former store managers 
said the district and regional managers above them continually warned of a "zero 
tolerance" policy toward overtime, except during the busy holiday season. These 
former managers said managers were frequently reprimanded when they allowed workers 
to clock more than 40 hours in a week, enabling the workers to receive time-and-a-half 
pay.</p>
<P> Most hourly Wal-Mart workers earn less than $8.50 an hour, which amounts to 
$17,680 a year for a full-time worker.</p>
<P> Jon Lehman, who retired last October after working for the company for 17 
years, including several as a store manager in Kentucky, said Wal-Mart warned 
managers repeatedly against going over budget or paying overtime.</p>
<P> "You got to hit the payroll budget they set for you, but if you're over, they 
discipline you," Mr. Lehman said in an interview. "People get demoted all the 
time for that. I've seen it happen numerous times to friends of mine. I've also 
seen store managers demoted for paying overtime." </p>
<P> When asked whether managers had been demoted for paying overtime, Rob Phillips, 
a company spokesman, responded, "Managers are evaluated, not on the fact of payment 
of overtime rates, but rather on how the business is managed."</p>
<P> Wal-Mart gives store managers another incentive to squeeze down labor costs 
by pegging annual bonuses to the profits of individual stores, a system rare among 
big retailers. The company declined to provide compensation figures, but according 
to depositions and interviews, many store managers have a base salary of $52,000, 
with bonuses often running $70,000 to $150,000.</p>
<P> Many analysts say Wal-Mart's push to minimize costs is the fiercest in the 
industry, and holding down labor costs — including fighting off unionization at 
its stores — is at the heart of Wal-Mart's effort to be the nation's low-cost 
retailer. </p>
<P> By many measures the nation's largest corporation, Wal-Mart has grown into 
a colossus, with $220 billion in annual sales, through a business model that goes 
well beyond holding down labor costs. It uses its size to buy in bulk and to pressure 
suppliers to keep prices down. It builds stores where real estate is cheap. It 
obtains many goods from low-wage manufacturers overseas. Its computerized inventory 
system and distribution network are considered the best and most cost-efficient 
among retailers. </p>
<P> These efforts have paid off. Wal-Mart's operating costs are 16.6 percent of 
sales, below the retail industry average of 20.7 percent and well under those 
of other giant retailers, like <org idsrc="NYSE" value="S">Sears Roebuck</org>, 
whose costs are 24.9 percent of sales.</p>
<P> "It's just ingrained in them to be very focused on controlling costs in all 
areas of their business all the time," said Sally Wallick, a retailing analyst 
at <org idsrc="NYSE" value="LM">Legg Mason</org>, an investment firm. "And in 
their business, small cuts can make a big difference." </p>
<P> Wal-Mart officials played down the extent of unpaid work by saying that employees 
often came forward to complain only after calling toll-free numbers that lawyers 
had established to seek information about off-the-clock work.</p>
<P> "Off-the-clock work is not prevalent at Wal-Mart despite the determined efforts 
of a few plaintiffs' attorneys to make it seem so," Mr. Wertz said. </p>
<P> But lawyers and union officials say that not only is the practice prevalent 
at Wal-Mart but that the complaints against the company are far greater than at 
competitors like Target, Sears or <org idsrc="NYSE" value="KM">Kmart</org>.</p>
<P> Frank Azar, a Colorado lawyer involved in more than a dozen lawsuits against 
Wal-Mart, said that more than 5,000 workers have contacted his and other law firms 
to complain of off-the-clock work at Wal-Mart.</p>
<P> To defend against such accusations, Wal-Mart officials have put forward dozens 
of employees who said they had never done off-the-clock work or been asked to 
do it.</p>
<P> Julie Rice, sales coordinator at a Sam's Club in Beavercreek, Ohio, said in 
a deposition that she had been compensated for "every minute of work" she had 
done for Wal-Mart. Dianne Huston, a cashier in Zanesville, Ohio, testified that 
she was never asked to work off the clock and that she was "not allowed to do 
anything off the clock."</p>
<P> Company officials note that few people have filed complaints about off-the-clock 
work with federal and state regulators.</p>
<P> But John Fraser, who ran the Federal Wage and Hour Administration for 11 years 
before retiring last year, said it was unlikely that the small number of complaints 
indicated anything about the pervasiveness of unpaid work at Wal-Mart. Workers, 
he said, are often reluctant to complain to the government, fearing they might 
lose their jobs if investigators contact their employer. </p>
<P> Mr. Fraser noted that even though few workers had filed complaints against 
Food Lion, the supermarket chain, the Labor Department, in an investigation a 
decade ago, found pervasive off-the-clock violations.</p>
<P> Retailing analysts, lawyers and Wal-Mart officials say it is hard to estimate 
the potential liability to the company in all these cases. Wal-Mart's defenders 
estimate liability could run several million dollars, while plaintiffs' lawyers 
say the cost could reach several billion.</p>
<P> In a recently certified class-action suit in Texas on behalf of more than 
200,000 current and former Wal-Mart workers, statisticians estimate that the company 
underpaid its Texas workers by $150 million over four years by not paying them 
for the many times they worked during their daily 15-minute breaks. That $150 
million estimate does not include other types of unpaid work. The statisticians, 
who analyzed time records from 12 Wal-Mart stores, found that the Texas employees 
averaged at least one hour of unpaid work each week from working through breaks.</p>
<P> In another lawsuit, involving just one store in Gallup, N.M., lawyers said, 
Wal-Mart agreed to a $400,000 settlement, coming to more than $2,500 a worker, 
after 120 workers complained of widespread unpaid work. Wal-Mart said that store 
was an isolated problem caused by a rogue manager.</p>
<P> <b>Punch Out, Keep Cooking</b></p>
<P> Every morning at 6, Liberty Morales arrived at Wal-Mart No. 2066 in Houston 
to stock the store's restaurant with hot dogs, buns, chips and soft drinks. She 
said it was often two hours before she clocked in.</p>
<P> At 5 on many afternoons, Ms. Morales said, the store's payroll manager phoned 
to tell her to clock out. But she did not go home; the store manager, she testified 
in a deposition in the Texas lawsuit, ordered her to keep running the restaurant 
for another hour or two because nobody else could do it. </p>
<P> "They would call me and say, `You need to clock out,' " Ms. Morales said in 
an interview. "I knew I had to go back and work after clocking out. There was 
no way the grill could continue operating with no one there to run it."</p>
<P> Ms. Morales said she knew better than to resist the demands because she had 
heard that those who complained were often fired, given fewer hours or put on 
overnight shifts. "I put up with it because I needed to work," said Ms. Morales, 
a 28-year-old mother of three who worked for Wal-Mart from 1996 to 2000. </p>
<P> Like many Wal-Mart workers, Ms. Morales has only a high school education and 
limited job skills, giving her few options better than Wal-Mart's.</p>
<P> She earned $9.50 an hour and usually worked 50 to 55 hours each week. Occasionally, 
she said, the store manager paid her time-and-a-half for a few hours, "but most 
of the weeks, I didn't get overtime."</p>
<P> Managers, she said, often announced on the intercom, "There will be no overtime 
this week." </p>
<P> "The store manager and the personnel manager would say if we went over 40 
hours, our time would be erased," said Ms. Morales, who said she quit because 
she felt overworked and underpaid.</p>
<P> Workers in other parts of the country told similar stories. Georgie Hartwig, 
who worked at a Wal-Mart north of Spokane, Wash., said her manager upbraided her 
one week because her timecard showed that she had worked a fraction more than 
40 hours — 36 seconds more, to be precise.</p>
<P> Colby LaGrue, who was in charge of the unloading operations at a Wal-Mart 
store outside New Orleans, said the store manager told him not to clock in during 
his first hour or two, which he spent talking with managers about what needed 
to be done each night.</p>
<P> Mr. LaGrue, who worked at Wal-Mart from 1990 to 1999, recalled episodes when, 
at the end of a shift, his managers were upset because the trucks had been unloaded 
but merchandise remained strewn around the back of the store. </p>
<P> "They would tell me to have the workers punch out and then call them back 
to get the stuff off the floor," Mr. LaGrue testified in a deposition in a Louisiana 
lawsuit. </p>
<P> "It was like a plantation," Mr. LaGrue said.</p>
<P> <b>How to `Get It Done'</b></p>
<P> The official policy that Wal-Mart provides its store managers is clear: "It 
is a violation of the law and Company policy to work off the clock or for a Supervisor 
or Manager to request Associates work off the clock."</p>
<P> But eight former managers said in interviews that headquarters set their store's 
payroll and staffing levels so low that it was nearly impossible to run their 
stores properly unless some employees worked more than 40 hours a week.</p>
<P> "Store managers told me to lean on people to get them to work off the clock," 
said Judy Danneman, who worked for Wal-Mart from 1989 to 2001 and was an assistant 
store manager at four of its Florida stores. "Everyone knew there was a lot of 
off-the-clock work going on."</p>
<P> If there was one dictate for store managers, it was not to exceed the payroll 
amount assigned them. In a deposition in the Colorado lawsuit, Radonna Perrin, 
one of the top payroll directors for Wal-Mart stores, said every store had to 
send headquarters a daily report that told whether the store exceeded its payroll 
limit, which was usually 8 percent of sales.</p>
<P> "They threatened to write up managers if they didn't bring the payroll in 
low enough," said Joyce Moody, who worked as a Wal-Mart manager in Alabama and 
Mississippi. "There were some managers who were demoted back to hourly associate 
for this."</p>
<P> Several managers said they saw little that was improper in demanding off-the-clock 
work because they had done it themselves when they were hourly employees who were 
eager to get ahead. Several employees said they felt so much a part of the Wal-Mart 
family that they were happy to do extra, unpaid work. </p>
<P> But Robert Eckert, a former assistant manager at five stores in California, 
said it was assistant managers who were squeezed most often. Each Wal-Mart has 
one store manager and two to six assistant managers.</p>
<P> "They tell you that working off the clock is against the law, is not allowed 
by Wal-Mart, and then they tell you to get the job done," Mr. Eckert said. "But 
they didn't give you the budget to get the job done."</p>
<P> As an assistant manager from 1996 to 1999, he said, he got the job done without 
requiring off-the-clock work by putting in 75 hours a week himself. But he said 
many managers who wanted to lead a normal life felt compelled to bend the rules.</p>
<P> "The Wal-Mart system is hurting the assistant manager who wants to have a 
family, wants to be an honest person, wants to get the job done," said Mr. Eckert, 
who said he quit Wal-Mart because he was unhappy with how it treated its managers 
and other employees. "The assistant manager is put in a position of, if I want 
to go home to my wife and family, I have to put pressure on someone to work off 
the clock."</p>
<P> <b>The Creative Timecard</b></p>
<P> As an assistant in a Wal-Mart's payroll department, Dorothy English said she 
was often asked to do startling things.</p>
<P> The store manager and several lower managers often ordered her to delete hours 
from employees' timecards, she testified in her deposition in the Louisiana lawsuit. 
If an employee had clocked 43 hours in a week, Ms. English said, her supervisor 
often asked her to delete three hours. </p>
<P> Other times, she said, when an employee worked through several 15-minute breaks, 
helping push that employee over 40 hours, her boss asked her to edit the timecard 
so it would show the worker had taken those breaks.</p>
<P> "It was a routine thing," she said in an interview. "I told them this wasn't 
right, but they said, `This is how we keep people to 40 hours.' "</p>
<P> To delete time from cards, she used Wal-Mart's computer, which allows managers 
to edit the times that punches are recorded.</p>
<P> "Sometime people would ask, `Where are my three hours?' " Ms. English said. 
"Then the managers would have to give it to them. But if people waited too long, 
you didn't get it. If you snooze, you lose."</p>
<P> In depositions, the store manager and payroll manager of Ms. English's Wal-Mart 
in Clearview, La., denied doctoring timecards. Wal-Mart officials insist that 
this practice is rare, saying the company disciplines and even fires managers 
found to have improperly deleted time.</p>
<P> But interviews and depositions pointed to additional cases of timecard manipulation 
in California, Colorado, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<P> Carolyn Thiebes, a former payroll manager at several Wal-Marts in Oregon, 
said she was often pressured to delete overtime. Ms. Thiebes, who has sued Wal-Mart 
over off-the-clock work, said in an affidavit that she sometimes edited time for 
legitimate reasons, such as when a worker forgot to clock back in after lunch. 
</p>
<P> But she added, "Many of the changes were made simply to reduce the amount 
of time associates would be paid for."</p>
