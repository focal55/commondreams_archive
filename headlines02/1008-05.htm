The UK Government is close to making a decision about deploying troops to the 
Middle East for possible war against Iraq. 
<P> Despite Downing Street's insistence that no decision has been made, Whitehall 
sources say an announcement could be made by the end of the month. 
<P> The news came as US President George Bush renewed his warnings to Saddam Hussein, 
and the UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw began a tour of Arab states in an attempt 
to gain support for any military action against Iraq. 
<P>After his talks with Mr Straw, Egypt's foreign minister warned against "rewriting 
the rules in the middle of the game", putting weapons inspections as the priority 
for the UN. 
<P> The BBC's Andrew Gilligan says sources have suggested it is increasingly likely 
that some UK armoured vehicles or tanks could be deployed in the Gulf region. 
<P> If tanks are to be used, it will take at least three months to transport them 
to Kuwait, their likely starting point, and to modify them for desert conditions. 
<P>The UK's main groups of Challenger Two battle tanks - the 7th Armoured Brigade 
and the 4th Armoured Brigade - are stationed in Germany. 
<P> They are likely to need to be specially altered for desert conditions, with 
special filters and rubber "skirts" to keep out the sand and raised exhausts. 
<P> The defence sources say they hope it would not be necessary to destroy the 
Iraqi army. 
<P> They claim there is a chance that a massive show of force by the United States 
and the UK could spark the overthrow of Saddam Hussein from within Iraq. 
<P>Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said it might be 
prudent to put troops in position. 
<P> But forces should not be committed to conflict unless action was sanctioned 
by Parliament, said Mr Campbell. 
<P><B>Diplomatic cornerstone</B> 
<P> The news comes to light hours after US President Bush delivered his latest 
warning to Saddam Hussein. 
<P> In a televised speech, Mr Bush said time was running out for the Iraqi leader 
and that he must disarm Iraq or face a coalition led by the US. 
<P> The UK and US are trying to convince members of the UN Security Council to 
support a tough resolution threatening military force if Baghdad backs out of 
its pledge to allow arms inspections. 
So far, they have yet to win over France, Russia and China - the other veto-wielding 
permanent members of the 15-state Security Council. 
<P><B>Inspectors focus</B> 
<P> UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who was in Paris on Monday before starting 
a four-day tour of the Middle East, stressed that effective diplomacy was the 
cornerstone in dealing with Iraq. 
<P> But he added that it must be backed by the threat of force. 
<P> The French said they would not rule out the use of military intervention if 
the inspections fail, but warned that inspectors must return to Iraq first.
<P><B>Peace process</B> 
<P> Mr Straw, who met Egypt's President Mubarak, has faced increasing Arab hostility 
to a second US-led Gulf war. 
<P> As talks over a new resolution continued, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed 
Maher said: "Rewriting the rules in the middle of the game may not be the best 
solution." 
<P> Current weapons inspections rules, which Mr Straw has called defective, had 
yielded results in the past, argued Mr Maher. 
<P> Asked whether Egypt would back using force against Iraq, Mr Maher said he 
did not believe in "predicting catastrophes before they happen". 
<P>Mr Straw himself said his meetings in Egypt showed it agreed with the UK on 
the need "if at all possible, to have this resolved by peaceful means". 
<P> As he continues his diplomatic offensive, Mr Straw is also expected to stress 
the new commitment by the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair to try to move forward 
the Middle East peace process.
