<p>JOHANNESBURG - Activists accused big business on Tuesday of hijacking the Earth 
Summit from its goal of curbing poverty without damaging the planet.
<p>"The resources of Mother Earth are being sold off," said Anuradha Mittal of 
<a href="http://www.foodfirst.org/index.html" target="_new">Food First</a> on 
the second day of the 10-day talks in Johannesburg tackling issues from promoting 
clean energy and preserving fish stocks to fighting AIDS.
<p>"The agenda has been taken over by the United States and  the European Union in trade liberalization," she said, as  activists complained about limited access to the main summit  venue.</span>

</table></font>Many other campaigners echoed charges that businesses 
would get better deals than those on environmental protection at the summit, a 
charge rejected by the main business lobby.</span><span class="newsContent">
<p>"Business is happy to work with others to deliver and make sure we address 
the environment issues and we look at the social side," said Mark Moody-Stuart, 
former chief executive of Shell and head of Business Action for Sustainable Development.
<p>BASD represents about 200 corporations in Johannesburg, including automakers, 
chemicals groups and oil majors.
<p>The summit is expected to bless partnerships between governments, companies 
and other groups to get together to solve problems including access to clean water, 
energy or healthcare or to improve policies on green agriculture or biodiversity.
<p>Many environmentalists are skeptical, saying the partnerships could be a backdoor 
way for governments to shirk responsibility and give big business opportunities 
to profit from expensive, privatized services ranging from water supply to electricity.
<p>Delegates from poor nations at the summit, which focused on environmentally 
friendly agriculture on Tuesday, say the United States is leading resistance to 
their calls for more aid and new timetables to meet goals of halving poverty and 
hunger by 2015.
<p>NO BLIND MARKET
<p>Poul Nielson, the European Union's Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian 
Aid, denied that the 15 nations were pushing rampant capitalist remedies: "The 
EU is not blindly accepting the market is the only way to do things," he said.
<p>Inside, many delegates at the World Summit on Sustainable Development blasted 
rich countries for giving about a billion dollars a day in subsidies to their 
farmers -- six times aid handouts to poor states totaling about $54 billion a 
year.
<p>"We're subsidizing farmers in the north to the tune of $1 billion a day to 
preserve some very valid goals like a way of life," said University of California 
professor Pedro Sanchez.
<p>"Can we take a piece of this billion dollars a day that European and North 
American farmers are getting...and put it toward ending hunger and poverty in 
the developing world?" he asked to loud applause in the plenary hall for negotiations.
<p>An end to farm subsidies in rich states would also enable poor countries to 
export more products -- ranging from textiles to cocoa -- and earn more foreign 
exchange to help development.
<p>But the United States recently increased agricultural subsidies while the European 
Union is bitterly divided over French-led resistance to cuts in its massive subsidy 
program.
<p>Noting World Bank figures calculating that giving them more access to Western 
markets could benefit developing countries to the tune of $150 billion a year 
-- almost treble what they get in aid -- British Environment Secretary Margaret 
Beckett told delegates that London strongly favored reform of EU subsidies.
<p>Members of non-governmental organizations accused organizers of changing rules 
to restrict their access to the heavily guarded convention center in Johannesburg, 
forcing them to queue while corporate delegates swept past.
<p>Summit organizers denied tightening up access to the plush, marble-floored 
conference center in Sandton, an area ringed by slums, saying they were struggling 
to manage about 16,000 delegates for a building that can take only about 7,000 
people.
<p>"We have tried not to close the doors to anybody who has a legitimate reason 
to be here," said Susan Markham, spokeswoman for the organizers. NGO delegates 
had to get special tags, as well as passes, to get in. Some grumbled that the 
neighboring mall was dominated by a huge display for German BMW luxury cars.
<p>NOT HOT AIR?
<p>But summit Secretary General Nitin Desai rejected widespread predictions that 
the meeting's draft 77-page conclusions will be mainly hot air. "This conference 
will be different," he told South African public radio. "The focus is very much 
on action."
<p>Desai said the summit had a better chance of success than a landmark summit 
in Rio de Janeiro a decade ago because it was building on U.N. agreements made 
in 2000 such as halving hunger and poverty by 2015. Though not legally binding, 
the U.N. hopes governments feel obliged to honor pledges made so publicly.
<p>More than 100 world leaders are due in Johannesburg for next week's finale, 
hoping to sign up to a plan to revive the spirit of Rio that led to projects to 
protect the planet from threats including global warming and the spread of deserts.
<p>But criticisms of watered-down proposals and President George Bush's absence 
has raised fears the summit could result in little more than a rehash of the pledges 
made in recent years.
<p>South African newspapers, meanwhile, focused on a planned crackdown by South 
African police on any demonstrations with one editorial saying that the roughly 
10,000 extra police drafted into one of Africa's most crime-ridden cities should 
stay. 
<p>"We need these police full time," the Citizen said. "Our needs are not less 
than those of pampered VIPs." Police have clamped down hard on small protests 
but organizers said they still planned to go ahead with a big, banned march on 
Saturday.</span>
