Death penalty opponents said they were appalled that yesterday's 
execution of killer Stephen Wayne Anderson took a full 29 minutes to complete, 
but those who helped put him on death row said their concerns were misplaced 
at best.
<P>"Everybody seems to think this is a very passive, easy process, but if it 
takes a half-hour, and takes four minutes for the body to stop convulsing, 
then this is not the humane process that many people feel that it is," said 
Lance Lindsey, who helped lead an anti-execution protest of about 500 people 
outside the prison gates during the execution.
<P>"This is a violent act, a horrible example for society and for our children.

No matter how long it took, the time Anderson spent lying on a San Quentin 
death chamber gurney as poisons entered his veins was still more merciful than 
the murder he dealt to his victims, execution advocates responded.
<P>"Didn't he just go to sleep?" said former San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Det. Wes Daw, who interrogated Anderson nearly 22 years ago after he shot an 
elderly woman to death. "I mean, what's wrong with him just sleeping for a few 
minutes before he dies?
<P>"The bottom line is, maybe he's repented and done everything right for 
years, but you know there are always consequences for an act," Daw said. "He 
needed to pay for what he did, and that's just what happened."
<P>Anderson was pronounced dead at 12:30 a.m. and left no last words, 
preferring instead to let his voluminous writings as an accomplished 
playwright and poet speak for themselves.
<P>Anderson, 48, was executed for the 1980 shooting death of 81-year-old 
Elizabeth Lyman of San Bernardino County during a burglary. He then fixed 
himself some noodles in her kitchen. He also confessed killing two men before 
that, although he later recanted parts of those admissions.
<P>The execution had begun at 12:01 a.m., when Anderson was led into the 
prison's apple-green death chamber and strapped onto a padded gurney. As he 
lay with his arms and legs secured, a lethal chemical mixture was pumped into 
his veins, rendering him unconscious, stopping his breathing and, finally, 
paralyzing his heart.
<P>Anderson was the 10th man to be put to death in California since executions 
resumed in 1992 after a 25-year hiatus.
<P>The only witnesses Anderson asked for were his two attorneys -- Robert 
Horwitz and federal public defender Margo Rocconi -- and Linda Meza, the 
psychologist who worked for his defense and befriended him. No relatives of 
Anderson or his victims watched him die.
<P>The death chamber was eerily quiet, unlike in other executions, with no 
displays of emotion -- no tears, no sighing, not even a cough. The otherwise 
inexpressive Anderson raised his head from the gurney just before the deadly 
fluids began to flow, saw Rocconi, and smiled. She mouthed the words, "I love 
you" three times, and Rocconi later said he mouthed "I love you" -- an 
exchange that reflected their platonic, though close, friendship as they 
fought together through the years in court to try to save Anderson's life.
<P>San Bernardino Deputy District Attorney David Whitney, who fought 
Anderson's appeals in court, sat in a chair in front of the death chamber, 
staring stoically throughout the execution, hands folded in his lap. He 
betrayed none of the emotion that was so strong prior to the execution when he 
dismissed Anderson's "pretty poetry" and said he richly deserved to die.
<P>The entire execution took longer than usual, veteran execution witnesses 
said -- although some executions, including last March's injection of Robert 
Lee Massie, also have taken about a half-hour.
<P>After the poisons began to enter his veins and he was rendered unconscious, 
his stomach heaved up and down dozens of times for about four minutes before 
he died -- unusual, because the chests of inmates being lethally injected 
typically heave once or twice, and then fall still.
<P>Anderson's last meal was two grilled cheese sandwiches, a pint of plain 
cottage cheese, and a mix of hominy and corn, topped off by a piece of peach 
pie, a pint of chocolate chip ice cream and radishes.
<P>His remains were taken to a nearby mortuary yesterday, where his brother 
and his attorneys were making arrangements for his cremation.
<P>After his death, his attorneys released part of one of his poems, titled 
"Unchained Visions, #9:"
<P><i>If no other misses you, I will:
</i>
<P><i>I will sense the emptiness
</i>
<P><i>where once you breathed.
</i>
