<p>EVERY election year, it seems, a candidate emerges and, citing the erosion 
of our political system, the vapid sound bites, the fleeing from real debate, 
the fusion of entertainment and political campaigning, declares that it is not 
worth playing by the rules. </p>

Stanley Aronowitz<br>

</table></font>Enter Stanley Aronowitz, 69, the Green Party's nominee this year for governor 
of New York, who, when you listen to him call for higher taxes to increase money 
for schools, pay for campaign finance reform and establish state-subsidized health 
insurance, is the anti-candidate this time around. He has set out to anger the 
powerful and the rich who, he says, pull the strings of the "Cheney-Rumsfeld-Bush 
regime," stressing that the troika is listed in order of importance. And, like 
all of those who believe in a cause, he is willing to go down with the ship rather 
than compromise.</p>
<P> "My job is to start a public conversation, to show voters they have a choice 
and to get enough of a vote so we can stay on the ballot and speak out," he said. 
"I am an intellectual. My work as a teacher and a writer is to elaborate on views 
and talk about them in detail."</p>
<P> Mr. Aronowitz drives himself to campaign gatherings around the state in his 
1995 Volvo. He sleeps in the homes of supporters and keeps within his allotted 
daily campaign travel budget of $50 a day. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who is 
running without the support of most of the party establishment, has raised millions 
so far for his campaign. Mr. Aronowitz, who has never run for public office, has 
raised $25,000. The Green Party has no budget for television advertising or to 
hire campaign workers. The whole campaign, he estimates, will cost about $150,000.</p>
<P> He blasts the money spent by corporations on the two major parties and those 
candidates, like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who can use personal fortunes to 
run for office.</p>
<P> "In many local communities we cannot get into the conversation because we 
have no television advertising," he said. "How can parties like ours have a conversation 
when a $78 million expenditure by a private businessperson buys an election?"</p>
<P> He began to admire President François Mitterrand of France once he heard him 
speak in Paris without notes on a range of complex political issues.</p>
<P> "When you give stump speeches you end up boring yourself and your audience," 
he said. "I heard Mitterrand and thought that if I ever ran for public office 
I would like to do it like that."</p>
<P> Mr. Aronowitz wants to be the little red light blinking on citizens' dashboards 
to tell them the system needs repair. And if, he said, "a few more thousand people" 
get the message he will have considered the time and energy worth it.</p>
<P> OUR democracy is in trouble," he said. "The Democratic and Republican Parties 
have converged. Their economic policies are not different. They believe that anything 
that hurts business is not a viable position."</p>
<P> Mr. Aronowitz, who teaches sociology at the City University of New York, is 
not, however, a man who stepped out of the cloistered garden of academia. He has 
always been a rebel. He was thrown out of Brooklyn College as a freshman in 1951 
for leading a campus demonstration after the administration banned a radical newspaper. 
He was married at 19 and had two children by the time he was 23. He is on his 
third marriage; his wife is the writer and N.Y.U. journalism professor Ellen Willis. 
He has five children. He and Professor Willis live in Washington Square Village.</p>
<P> Mr. Aronowitz worked for a decade as a steelworker in Harrison, N.J., and 
for seven years as an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. Fifteen 
years after leaving college he went to the New School for Social Research and 
got a B.A. in sociology, and later got a doctorate in sociology from Union Graduate 
School.</p>
<P> Ideas spill out of his head — he speaks in long machine-gun bursts — with 
a Brooklyn twang. He has always had a voracious appetite for books and relishes 
discussing Hannah Arendt or Herbert Marcuse as much as he does global warming. 
When he ended his night shift in the steel mill, he ate breakfast and went to 
the company library for an hour or two before going home. He started a reading 
group with other workers — they read mostly novels — and would get home at noon 
and sleep until his shift began again.</p>
<P> "One of the reasons I chose the steel mill, rather than an automobile factory 
where I could have made more money, was because when you work near furnaces you 
work 40 minutes on and 20 minutes off," he said. "I spent part of the 20 minutes 
politicking, because I was a union activist. But many times I would go into the 
bathroom and read. At that period in my life I read American history."</p>
<P> "I learned as a labor organizer how to translate substantive, often difficult 
ideas, into the vernacular," he said. "I learned to talk plain but to talk real 
issues."</p>
<P> "The Brothers Karamazov" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, he said, is one of his favorite 
pieces of fiction, along with the novels of William Faulkner. But these works, 
he said, were not always translatable to the crowd.</p>
<P> "Dostoyevsky taught me about irony," he said. "I have great trouble with this 
as a would-be politician. You cannot be a successful politician and be ironic. 
Our slogan — tax and spend — is meant to be ironic, but people don't get it. They 
get upset."</p>
