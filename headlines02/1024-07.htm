<p>As talk of war with Iraq intensified a few months ago, Susan Mcfarlane decided 
to find a way to express her concern in some public fashion. She wound up designing 
a button that said WOW -- for Women Opposing War.
<p> In August, she had 250 printed in red, white and blue and began handing them 
out to her friends. Two months later, 10,000 buttons have been distributed, part 
of a nascent anti-war movement growing in the state among disparate groups of 
people -- from traditional peace advocates to loosely knit collections of friends, 
physicians and college students.
<p> Some of them will be voicing their concerns Saturday in Washington at a peace 
march that will begin at Constitution Gardens adjacent to the Vietnam Veterans 
War Memorial at 11 a.m., and end at the White House.
<p> Unlike the protests of the Vietnam era that were born on college campuses, 
the current movement seems to have garnered as much support from older generations 
that span several eras -- World War II, Korea and Vietnam -- as from those in 
their teens and 20s. 
<p> The protesters include Mcfarlane, a gray-haired, mild-mannered woman whose 
message is of compassion; a group of city school teachers; and St. John&#39;s 
College students who organized a protest at the State House in Annapolis a little 
over a week ago.
<p> However, they seem to share the belief that unilateral action against Iraq 
would be a mistake.
<p> &quot;Our group is not opposed to war across the board or war in Iraq, in 
any case. We just feel it can be handled better,&quot; said Ryan Rylee, a St. 
John&#39;s College senior who has helped organize the St. John&#39;s College Student 
Coalition for Social Responsibility. &quot;One thing we all agree on is that the 
issue needs more discussion and questioning than has been allowed.&quot;
<p> Since the end of the summer, a number of local groups have been formed out 
of concern over possible war with Iraq. Citizens for Peace emerged from discussions 
among friends about ways to make a difference in the political discussion in Washington, 
said Peter French, a city school teacher who helped organize the group last month. 
Citizens for Peace, which includes a musician, an author, a librarian and other 
teachers, decided to try to influence the vote of U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski. 
So they held two protests in front of her office, one of which they said attracted 
more than 100 people.
<p> Waving thawing waffles in the air, French said the group tried to get her 
to stop &quot;waffling&quot; on the issue just days before the vote. Mikulski 
and U.S. Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, both Democrats, voted against a measure to give 
President Bush broad authority to use military force against Iraq.
<p> Mcfarlane&#39;s action was similarly spontaneous, but instead of using confrontation, 
she asked people to tell President Bush they believed he is too compassionate 
and ethical a man to engage in war with Iraq.
<p> Some groups formed after Sept. 11 of last year have turned their focus toward 
war protest in the past several months. Women in Black, a loose-knit coalition 
of women, organized the Peace Path along Charles Street on the anniversary of 
the terrorist attacks. Hundreds of people lined the street to remember the deaths 
in Washington, Pennsylvania and New York, but many signs had an anti-war theme 
as well.
<p> The American Friends Service Committee, which has opposed many wars over the 
years, has seen an increase in calls and interest in the peace movement in the 
past several months. Gary Gillespie, the Baltimore program director, said a group 
of about eight people has maintained a vigil from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. every Friday 
on Charles Street outside the Homewood Friends Meeting House since Sept. 11 of 
last year. In recent weeks, the number has grown to about 80, he said.
<p> Nearby, at the Johns Hopkins University campus, a group of professors and 
graduate students organized a recent teach-in. Paul Kramer, assistant history 
professor, said, &quot;Our hope is to get people thinking about the issues and 
to also do what we can to build at Hopkins a community that is able to raise questions 
if war comes.&quot;
<p> Activists said they expected hundreds of people locally to participate in 
the peace march Saturday, including members of Physicians for Social Responsibility, 
nuns from the School Sisters of Notre Dame and a group from the American Friends 
Service Committee. </p>
