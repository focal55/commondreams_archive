BUENOS AIRES, Argentina  - Argentina's new
President Eduardo Duhalde, blaming free market policies of the
last decade for creating social chaos, asked Congress on Friday
to rescue the economy by allowing a traumatic currency
devaluation.
<p>Duhalde proposed a bill to Congress that seeks special
powers enabling him to dismantle the peg that kept the peso
one-to-one against the U.S. dollar. That peg was blamed for
worsening a four-year economic slump that sparked deadly riots
and political chaos.
<p>Congress, controlled by Duhalde's Peronist party, will
almost certainly pass the bill, which also gives the president
powers to reform the foreign exchange and banking systems,
regulate prices of goods and services, safeguard the value of
savers' bank deposits and ensure debtors do not go bankrupt.
<p>While Congress prepared to act this weekend, Argentines
huddled in pouring rain outside banks wondering if they would
ever recover their deposits. Drug stores ran out of medicines
like insulin, and shops raised prices to hedge against a
devaluation that will be an effective income cut for millions.
<p>Duhalde became the fifth president in over two weeks after
food riots left 27 dead and shook one of Latin America's
wealthiest countries. He is placing the burden of devaluation
on banks, foreign investors and big firms like oil companies.
<p>``We want to finish with an alliance of decades in the
country, the alliance of political power with financial power
at the expense of industry,'' Duhalde, a 60-year-old power
broker known for favoring trade protectionism and heavy state
spending, said in a speech to businessmen.
<p>Harkening back to statism that is largely a thing of the
past in Latin America, he plans to fix price limits for basic
goods and services including bread and telephone service to
stem devaluation-induced hyperinflation of the sort that
ravaged Argentina in the 1980s.
<p>Eager to avoid the social protests that caused President
Fernando de la Rua to resign last month, which heralded
political chaos as three other presidents quickly came and
went, Duhalde has also promised measures to safeguard debtors
and savers.
<p>Economists are skeptical the measures will succeed because
Argentines have lost all confidence in banks and the new system
is seen as open to corruption and growth of a black market.
<p>Some Argentines voted with their feet, lining up by the
Italian consulate to ask for visas to leave the country.
<p>But perhaps in a sign that economic nationalism touched a
cord among Argentines, there were no major street protests
against the measures. Banging of pots and pans by the country's
middle class and their spontaneous marches had already led to
the resignations of two presidents in December.
<p>DRAMATIC SHIFT IN POLICY
<p>The new program is an about-turn from the free market
policies that made Argentina a darling of Wall Street. In Latin
America, most countries have accepted a free-market focus with
polices often encouraged by the United States.
<p>It could pit the government, which defaulted on Thursday on
part of its $141 billion debt in what may become the biggest
default in history, against foreign bond holders and investors.
<p>On Friday, many of the top foreign firms in Argentina, who
benefited from a 1990s privatization program, met to discuss
the government's aim to lock in prices in pesos rather than the
dollars in their concession contracts.
<p>Oil companies will also be hit with a levy on their exports
to compensate banks for what will prove a costly restructuring
of dollar debts.
<p>The bill itself contained no more details on devaluation of
the peso but local media report the devaluation could be around
30 percent. There would be an official rate for foreign trade
and another perhaps for smaller transactions.
<p>It was not clear how a dual exchange rate system would
work. Many Argentines fear a return to the currency paranoia of
the 1980s, when small-time traders lined streets offering
dollars.
<p>Duhalde's plans were met with skepticism.
<p>``I bet he'll tell the bankers exactly what they want to
hear too,'' one businessman from the engineering sector said.
<p>The proposed bill would convert private contracts to pesos
in a country whose currency has been pegged one-to-one to the
dollar for a decade and where even house purchases are made
with wads of dollars. It would restructure small dollar debts
to protect peso-earning Argentines from the devaluation.
<p>Congress is dominated by Duhalde's Peronist Party which
ran the country from 1989 to 1999 and racked up much of the
debt now crippling Argentina.
<p>Despite the nationalist hue, the government did wink to
the foreign financial community by announcing a ``sharp''
reduction in spending demanded by the International Monetary
Fund  and Washington and hopes of ``favorable effects'' in six
months.
<p>IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger talked to
Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov on Friday for the first
time, but the lender did not reveal details of the call.
<p>IMF sources said it would be unlikely that the fund would
support Argentina if it went ahead with the dual currency
system, as such plans are not recommended by the fund's
governing rules.
<p>Argentina's foreign creditors meanwhile said they will
refrain for now from demanding immediate payment on their
defaulted bonds and try to negotiate a restructuring.
<p>Converting dollar debts into pesos should help shield the
average Argentine from the impact of the devaluation, but it
shifts the burden to the banks, which will need help.
<p>``Without support the banks would not remain viable,'' said a
Lehman Bros research note. ``Given that the government neither
has the means to provide this support nor defend/shepherd the
floating or re-pegged peso, we assume IMF support.''</p>
