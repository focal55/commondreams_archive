<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq -- American activists took to the streets yesterday outside the 
U.S. Interests Section of the Polish Embassy -- not to march but to lie down, 
"to give blood, not shed blood."</p>
<p>About a dozen men and women from various groups, including Seattle residents, 
donated blood in a demonstration calling for the lifting of economic sanctions 
and an end to threats of war.</p>

<p>Iraqi doctors set up shop on the dusty sidewalks outside the embassy while 
activists filled several cots on the street, as curious guards looked on.</p>
<p>"We are here to tell President Bush that if he is really serious about getting 
rid of weapons of mass destruction, he should immediately lift the sanctions that 
have killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis," said Ramzi Kysia of Washington, 
D.C., speaking for Voices in the Wilderness, a Chicago-based group trying to end 
economic sanctions and prevent another war with Iraq. </p>
<p>Spurred by fears of imminent war, humanitarian and peace activists from around 
the United States have been coming to Iraq in recent weeks to assess the damage 
done by war and sanctions and what further damage can be expected. </p>
<p>The Iraqi Peace Team, sponsored by Voices in the Wilderness, is here to work 
in clinics, food distribution sites, hospitals and other sites to make an anti-war 
statement and, if necessary, to act as human shields if attacks begin. An artist 
from Victoria, B.C., is creating a 24-foot-tall bronze sculpture with the help 
of artists in Baghdad.</p>
<p>"I came to Iraq for a second time because I wanted to reconnect with the people, 
many of whom I became very fond of when I was here before," said the Rev. Sharon 
Moe, minister of University Temple United Methodist Church in Seattle.</p>
<p>Moe, 54, traveled to Iraq in May with a delegation from Washington Physicians 
for Social Responsibility and returned on Sept. 29 as part of a Voices in the 
Wilderness group.</p>
<p>"But even more than that, I wanted to make a stand against what the president 
is calling on us all to do, which is to hate and be afraid of the people of Iraq," 
Moe said. "So, coming here was a stand against that, a refusal to give in to the 
fear that is being stirred up in the U.S."</p>
<p>"My heart grieves for these people," said Moe. "If there's a war, when there's 
a war, there will be an inordinate amount of suffering, and it will be suffering 
for the sake of a lie -- that we're afraid of weapons of mass destruction, when 
really we just want control of the oil market."</p>
<p>United Nations officials estimate that 500,000 children have died since 1991 
in the wake of the war damage and subsequent international sanctions. Iraq still 
lacks some basic medical supplies, such as antibiotics, as well as fully functioning 
water systems and other services. Cancer patients are often told to buy their 
own medications</p>
<p>There are some signs of improvement, however. UNICEF figures show the malnutrition 
rate is declining, the vaccination rate is going up and there have been improvements 
in communications, agriculture and the electrical supply. Also, everywhere in 
Iraq, from Baghdad to Basra, there is a surge of housing construction.</p>
<p>Other Seattle activists now in Iraq as part of the Voices group include Bert 
Sacks, a retired engineer, and Ginny NiCarthy, a an activist in the non-violence 
movement since the 1960s who works for the American Friends Service Committee 
and the Fellowship of Reconciliation.</p>
<p>Sacks, 62, denounces the Pentagon for targeting civilian infrastructure during 
the Gulf War. </p>
<p>"The hospitals and clinics are the battlefield on which more children have 
died than all of the soldiers killed during the Gulf War," said Sacks, who is 
making his ninth visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>Early this year, Sacks received a letter from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets 
Control demanding that he pay a $10,000 fine for taking some $40,000 worth of 
medicine on one of his previous trips. Instead of paying the fine, Sacks raised 
more than that amount in donations, but used the money to buy medicine for a hospital 
in Basra. He delivered that medicine to the Saddam Teaching Hospital on Monday.</p>
<p>NiCarthy, 75, said "the main reason I wanted to come to Iraq was to see real 
people. . . . I watch a lot of bad television, and I see the pundits, and in the 
background they have Hussein with his guns and they talk about all the terrible 
things he's done, but there is never a picture of a human."</p>
<p>Tom Nagy, a professor at George Washington University, and James Longley, a 
videographer from New York City, also came with the Seattle delegation.</p>
<p>Nagy wrote an article in The Progressive magazine documenting how extensive 
damage to Iraq's infrastructure during the Persian Gulf War led to the country's 
current epidemic of water-borne illnesses. Longley, whose documentary "Gaza Strip" 
is currently showing in the United States, is taping conditions in Iraq for use 
by Sacks' legal team should the dispute with the U.S. government over the unpaid 
$10,000 fine end up in court.</p>
<p>Derek Houston, the Canadian artist, has made three trips to Iraq, two at the 
invitation of the minister of culture.</p>
<p>"I do not like politics; politics are dirty," he said. "My work is about hope 
-- it is about speaking out when you see something wrong."</p>
<p>Houston plans to have his abstract bronze of a mother, father and child shipped 
to Canada, where it will be placed at the center of a peace park he is creating 
in northeast British Columbia, on the flank of Portage Mountain, north of a small 
town called Hudson's Hope.</p>
<p>"I love Iraq and its people, but I would rather be anywhere else in the world 
than here at this moment in time," said Houston. "But I have no choices -- I have 
to do this for the safety of my children's future."</p>
<p>Other activists who came individually or as part of other delegations include 
Nathan Mauger of Spokane; Danny Muller of Brooklyn; David Smith-Fevvi of northern 
California, but formerly from Seattle; and Henry Williamson of Charleston, S.C.</p>
<p><i>P-I foreign desk editor Larry Johnson and photographer Paul Kitagaki Jr. 
have been dispatched to Iraq to report on the mood and conditions as the country 
faces the threat of attack from the United States.</i></p>
