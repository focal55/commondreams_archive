<p>Thousands of anti-war demonstrators took to the streets of Seattle last night 
-- the second time in less than a week -- pounding the pavement in the hope that 
options for a peaceful resolution in Iraq aren't drowned out by the rising drumbeat 
for war.</p>

</font>The candlelight vigil and procession from downtown Seattle to St. Mark's 
Cathedral on Capitol Hill was called for by the Church Council of Greater Seattle, 
which wanted to duplicate the march it sponsored on the eve of the Persian Gulf 
War in 1991.</p> 
<p>Crowd estimates then ranged from 12,000 to 30,000. It was considered the largest 
such anti-war protest in the country.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 people marched up Broadway last night, forming a five-block 
procession that filled the street.</p>
<p>The marchers -- from many races and religions -- walked toward St. Mark's with 
their candles burning. Some came in blue jeans and others in business suits. There 
were a few songs and a pounding drum. But mostly they walked quietly.</p>
<p>Many carried signs that read "No Iraq War." Nathan Lewis of Seattle carried 
a recruiting poster he downloaded from a Web site. It showed Osama bin Laden pointing 
and saying, "I want you to invade Iraq."</p>
<p>Warren Jones of North Seattle had a homemade sign: "I love my country. I fear 
my government."</p>
<p>"I can think of nothing better to recruit terrorists around the world than 
an attack on Iraq," he said.</p>
<p>As the marchers crossed over Interstate 5 on Madison Street, freeway drivers 
honked a chorus of a supportive horns. </p>
<p>Nearby, the march stalled traffic at Boren and Madison. It kept Chris Causey 
of Tacoma waiting, but he didn't care.</p>
<p>"I'm definitely against the whole movement toward war," he said after he got 
out of his truck to show support for the marchers.</p>
<p>Along the way, others fell into line.</p>
<p>Anne Brewer had come to Broadway carrying white candles in her purse.</p>
<p>"I'm just going to be with the others. I like silent marches because they are 
so powerful," said Brewer, a 20-year resident of Capitol Hill. She took part in 
the huge march 11 years ago and felt compelled to walk again last night, even 
though she fears war is inevitable.</p>
<p>"I am frightened for all of us because our civil rights are being jeopardized. 
There is no reason for this that I've found. It will be a terrible mistake," she 
said.</p>
<p>At Broadway and Pine Street, dozen of people waited for the marchers to arrive.</p>
<p>Scott Morrison of Seattle carried his 22-month-old son, Finn, on his shoulders 
and pushed his 8-week-old son, Olaf, in a stroller as he joined the march.</p>
<p>"I don't like the precedent that this would set," he said of a war on Saddam 
Hussein. "There are a lot of other bad dictators in the world."</p>
<p>Tami Thomas of Woodinville and John McLaren of Seattle showed up feeling a 
little bit hopeless, given that opinion polls show many support President Bush's 
Iraq policy.</p>
<p>But McLaren said there seemed to be what he called cognitive dissonance. "Everybody 
I talked to is against this bombing. I don't know where they get that number" 
of support for the war.</p>
<p>Thomas was on Broadway "hoping it makes it somewhat obvious that there are 
people who oppose this war."</p>
<p>She added: "I'd like people from other countries to see that all Americans 
aren't the bullies that the American government is."</p>
<p>The rally began with brief services at the First United Methodist Church. At 
least 1,200 people filled the pews of both floors of the sanctuary, and others 
stood. Outside, crowds listened via loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Mention of U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott, the Seattle Democrat who has become a controversial 
opponent of a war, brought the crowd to its feet. So did the news that U.S. Sen. 
Patty Murray, D-Wash., announced yesterday that she will oppose a resolution that 
would give war powers to the president.</p>
<p>The Rev. Rich Gamble of Keystone United Church of Christ in Seattle told the 
crowd about his visit to Iraq earlier this year. The faces of the people, he said, 
stay with him.</p>
<p>People there treated him with respect, he said, adding that they knew the difference 
between a country's rulers and its people. "Unfortunately," he said, "we, too, 
are learning to live in a country ruled by people unresponsive to our wishes."</p>
<p>Ali-Salaam, imam of the Sea-Tac Masjid Mosque and Islamic Center of Washington, 
urged people to "take back their synagogues, take back their churches and take 
back the mosques" from those practicing fundamentalist and intolerant religion.</p>
<p>A children's choir sang "We Are the Children of Peace" in both English and 
Arabic at First United Methodist. Those in the pews began to join the children 
in the chorus:</p>
<p>"We don't want war anymore. We are the children of the world."</p>
<p>The past year has not been easy for Seattle peace activists trying to maintain 
the city's war-protest reputation, especially under the president's "you are either 
with us or against us" rallying cry for the invasion of Afghanistan. </p>
<p>More show up at every new event, though. Authorities in Washington, D.C., and 
San Francisco are preparing for mass demonstrations planned for Oct. 26 in those 
cities. </p>
<p>A majority of American adults, 53 percent, support an invasion of Iraq, according 
to the latest CNN-USA Today-Gallup Poll conducted last week. But those numbers 
have been in steady decline since last November when support peaked at 74 percent.</p>
<p>Marc Grossberg, 54, of Seattle, said it felt good last night to be surrounded 
by what appears to be the minority. </p>
<p>"There are a lot of people with similar feelings and this helps draw them all 
together," he said. </p>
<p>The first people to St. Mark's Cathedral filtered in singing hymns it seemed 
they had long ago committed to memory -- "We shall overcome . . . we shall work 
for peace" -- until the pews and chairs were full and the mass spilled out onto 
the lawn. </p>
<p>"Now we've walked and been counted by someone in a helicopter," said the Rev. 
Pete Strimer, canon missioner at the cathedral, "and tomorrow we will be underestimated."</p>
<p>Strimer then returned to the earnest message that those who marched had carried 
with them through the streets of Seattle. He encouraged them to make the vigil 
just the beginning of their anti-war activism. </p>
<p>"There will be days of action from this moment until the war is stopped," Strimer 
said.</p>
