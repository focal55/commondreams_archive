        </font></font>

        </b>

<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>I, Gail Barr, declare: </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>1. I am the former wife of Robert Barr, congressman 
from Georgia. I know all of the following facts of my own knowledge and, if 
called and sworn as a witness, could, and would, competently testify thereto. I 
give this affidavit freely and voluntarily, of my own will, without any duress. 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. I first met Robert Barr (hereinafter, 
&quot;Bob&quot;) at a dinner party in Falls church, Virginia, in March of 1976. 
We both worked for the Central Intelligence Agency at the time. He was separated 
from his first wife at the time. Bob and I began dating soon after we met. In 
October 1976, we were married. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>3. Bob was attending Georgetown Law School when we 
met, and graduated in June of 1977. About a year after his graduation, he wanted 
to leave the Central Intelligence Agency and move to Georgia to practice law. I 
took a cut in pay to move to Georgia to take a position in a local federal 
agency. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>4. Bob, who was born in Iowa, had attended the 
University of Southern California as an undergraduate, and his roommate there 
was there from Georgia. Bob had visited Georgia with his roommate. Bob had been 
involved with the Young Democrats while he was an undergraduate. Bob told me 
that his parents would not pay for his college education if he continued his 
involvement with the Young Democrats. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>5. When Bob and I married, we both wanted 
children. We planned to have three children. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>6. After we moved to Atlanta, Bob became active in 
politics. He was president of our homeowners' association. He became chairman of 
the Cobb County Republican Party. He began attending more and more political 
functions. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>7. Bob thoroughly enjoyed politics, and he was 
very ambitious and his ambitions were his first priority. He told me that he 
wanted to be President of the United States, and retire as a U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>8. In March of 1983, I became pregnant for the 
third time. When I became pregnant the third time, our two sons were three years 
old and a year-and-a-half. I was 38 years old, concerned with health 
complications the pregnancy might present, and Bob's practice was slow, and he 
was not home much. We did not have any health insurance. I asked Bob what we 
should do; whether I should have an abortion. He said it was entirely my 
decision and that I should do whatever I wanted to do. This was an extremely 
difficult choice, but Bob did not want to help in making the decision, even 
though he was the father. If Bob had said, &quot;No, don't have an 
abortion,&quot; I never would have had it done. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>9. Bob never told me not to have the abortion, or 
that he was in any way against my having the abortion. Any statement he made 
that he expressed his opposition to the abortion is simply not true. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>10. On the Saturday of the Memorial Day weekend in 
1983, Bob drove me to the clinic to have an abortion. He watched our boys at 
home while the procedure was done. He then came to the clinic to to get me. He 
paid for the procedure. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>11. Through 1983 and into 1984, Bob became more 
involved with politics. He spent more time away from home. His law practice 
still was not doing well. In May 1984, I had an operation for breast cancer. I 
was undergoing chemotherapy throughout the summer of 1984. Our boys were four 
and two-and-a-half. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>12. In 1984, Bob was running for a state 
representative seat in Georgia against an incumbent. I asked him to stop 
campaigning after my cancer surgery and while going through chemotherapy, but he 
refused. He told me that the campaign would take my mind of my health problems. 
He never went to the chemotherapy treatments with me. He never tried to 
understand what I was going through. He was not there for me when I needed him. 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>13. Instead, I helped Bob with his campaign. Our 
sons and I would stuff mailboxes, take part in parades, and otherwise try to 
help with his campaign. Bob lost that election. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>14. Because of the cancer, I was not able to have 
any more children. Bob and I were opposed to adoption, so our plans to have 
three children never happened. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>15. On a Saturday night about two weeks before 
Thanksgiving of 1985, Bob announced to me in our garage, &quot;I don't love you 
anymore,&quot; and that he was moving out. Our boys were five-and-a-half and 
four. I asked him to stay at least through Thanksgiving, but he refused and left 
immediately. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>16. In July, 1985, Bob had joined Cobb Leadership, 
a group of civic leaders from Cobb County, Georgia. Jeri, his current wife, also 
was a member of Cobb Leadership. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>17. A few months after Bob 
left the home, he moved into an apartment building where Jeri resided. Our 
children would visit him there. They would come home and tell me about 
&quot;Dad's water bed&quot; and how they were spending time with 
&quot;Jeri.&quot; While Bob and I were separated and before our divorce, Bob and 
our boys also would spend the night at Jeri's. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>18. Bob, our sons, and Jeri would go swimming 
together and go to church together during the time Bob and I were separated. Bob 
took Jeri to political and social functions. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>19. After Bob left us, he attempted to draw up the 
divorce papers by himself. He wanted me to immediately sell the house and to 
split the proceeds. In April of 1986, I hired an attorney to protect my 
interests and the interest of our sons. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>20. In May and June of 1986, Bob and Jeri, Bob's 
current wife, were deposed. Both refused under oath to answer questions about 
their relationship either as it existed prior to time Bob left us or during the 
time Bob and I were separated. Specifically, each refused to answer whether they 
were having an affair during my marriage to Bob. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>21. Looking back, it is evident to me that Bob was 
having an affair with Jeri before Bob and I were divorced. During the summer of 
1985, we would receive telephone calls at home, but when answered, the person 
would hang up. Bob was coming home later and later in the evening. Sometimes, he 
would not get home until the early hours of the morning. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>22. Changes took place in Bob. He had always worn 
glasses, but he switched to contact lenses. He started wearing custom suits. He 
took a renewed interest in his appearance. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>23. In September of 1985, I was helping out as a 
secretary in Bob' s law office. He had me call to make luncheon arrangements 
with the woman he later married. Obviously, at the time, I did not realize Bob 
was having a romantic relationship with this woman. Friends would tell me that 
they saw Bob and Jeri holding hands at the mall or in restaurants. Also in 
October of 1985, the Cobb Leadership had a weekend conference in the Georgia 
mountains. Both Bob and Jeri attended. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>24. In October of 1985, Bob helped Jeri with a 
speeding ticket. One night soon after that, Bob brought home a Halloween card. 
When I asked who it was from, he said &quot;nobody.&quot; At the time I thought 
nothing more of it. It was my opinion that it was from Jeri. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>25. Our divorce was finalized on November 1986. A 
month before, in October of 1986, Bob was named United States Attorney. Bob 
married Jeri in December of 1986. I was given custody of our children. I have 
not remarried. I currently work for the federal government. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>26. In 1989, I filed a contempt action to compel 
him to reimburse some of the boys' medical expenses. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>27. Although Bob and I have had arguments and disagreements since the 
divorce, we have managed to get along for the sake of our sons. In fact, when 
Bob was running for his congressional seat in 1994, I along with my family, 
contributed money to finance a newspaper advertisement on Bob's behalf and did a 
radio commercial in support of Bob. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>28. I did not approach LFF, Inc., or Larry Flynt. 
They contacted me regarding Bob. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws 
of the State of Georgia and the United States of America that the foregoing is 
true and correct. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Executed this 8th day of January, 1999 at Atlanta, 
Georgia. </FONT>
