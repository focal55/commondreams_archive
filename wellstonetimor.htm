Wednesday September 8, 1999</font></font><br>

</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. 
President, I rise today to condemn the brutal violence occurring at this very 
moment against the people of East Timor. I am outraged that the Indonesian government 
and army have done nothing to effectively stop the horrifying destruction and 
rampage across this land. The Indonesian government has not lived up to its commitment 
to maintain security and protect the people of East Timor. In fact, it appears 
that it is openly supporting the militia violence against the majority of East 
Timorese, who bravely cast their vote for independence. If the Indonesia government 
cannot or will not maintain the peace, I believe a strong international peace 
keeping mission is the best option. Further, I believe that if the Indonesian 
government does not immediately take steps to stop the carnage in East Timor, 
the United States must use any and all of its economic leverage with that government, 
until a safe and secure environment is restored.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week in a referendum with nearly 100 percent 
turnout, East Timor's voters bravely went to the polls and overwhelmingly voted 
to support independence from Indonesia. In 1975, after Portugal withdrew from 
its colony of East Timor, Indonesia brutally invaded. Since then, more than 200,000 
of East Timor's population have perished from massacres, disease and famine. Against 
this backdrop, against this terrible history, there was an historic vote. At long 
last on August 30, the East Timorese risked their lives go to the polls to vote 
for their future and to determine the fate of their homeland. Now that courageous 
and brave act is being systematically and deliberately undermined by the Indonesian 
military authorities.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rampaging militias, with the backing of the Indonesian 
military and police, are taking their revenge. As I speak this moment, East Timor 
is being set on fire, people are being shot and beheaded, their homes looted and 
destroyed, or being loaded like cattle onto trucks and driven to the border. Even 
Nobel Laureate Bishop Belo's home was raised, and the 6,000 frightened people 
who took refuge in his compound, forced to flee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What East Timor is suffering from is not chaos, 
but an organized rampage by the militias, as thousands of Indonesian troops stand 
by and even participate. The 15,000 Indonesian army and police officers in East 
Timor have done absolutely nothing to stop the terror, arrest the perpetrators, 
or protect the victims.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right after the results were announced on Saturday 
morning, militias immediately went on what appeared to be a planned and coordinated 
offensive across the territory. There have been extensive eyewitness accounts 
of army officers taking part in militia operations and of militia being backed 
by lines of soldiers in their attacks. Any East Timorese associated in any way 
with the UN Mission in East Timor, was targeted. Thousands of displaced people 
were attacked in their places of refuge, and some of them have been trucked to 
West Timor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian army may be trying to teach a lesson 
not only to East Timorese but to the people in secessionist struggles in other 
parts of Indonesia. The lesson is: if you legitimately seek separation from Indonesia, 
even if support for separation is overwhelming, we will destroy you and no outside 
power will come to your aid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian armed forces could stop the violence 
if it had the political will to do so. All of the attacks over the last week, 
indeed most of the attacks over the last six months, with few exceptions, have 
been initiated by militias that were created, armed, and supported by the Indonesian 
military. Local human rights organization, UN personnel, and other international 
agencies have identified Indonesian officers working directly with the militias 
in acts of violence. These names have been turned over to the appropriate Indonesian 
authorities, but no action of any kind whatsoever has been taken against them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Indonesian government and army has the 
ability but not the will to stop the violence, we must use every appropriate means 
possible to press it to either stop the militia violence now or allow international 
peacekeepers in.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Jakarta's consent for an international peace-keeping 
force will require strong, immediate pressure from the United States, Australia 
and Japan, and other key donor states. America must take the lead and cut off 
all military aid and sales. I believe the Secretary of Treasury should instruct 
US executive directors to international financial institutions to oppose financial 
assistance to the Indonesian government. International financial institutions 
should withhold the balance of any undisbursed approved loans or other assistance 
to the Indonesian government. All but humanitarian loans and aid should cease.<br>
<br>
The resumption of aid should be conditional on:<br>
<br>
1) the ability of the UN to fully and safely resume its operations in East Timor, 
with full freedom for local and international staff to work and travel without 
abuse;<br>
<br>
2) the ability of refugees to return home safely and the arrest of key militia 
leaders responsible for acts of violence;<br>
<br>
3) steps taken by the Indonesian government to implement the results of the vote 
on East Timor's political status; and,<br>
<br>
4) the Indonesian military conducting itself in a law abiding manner, consistent 
with international humanitarian and human rights law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For too long the Congress has allowed military and 
economic assistance to be awarded to the government of Indonesia with few conditions, 
despite its grim human rights record and its deplorable treatment of the people 
of East Timor. The time has now come for the Indonesian government to learn that 
the United States and the international community will not tolerate the violent 
suppression of the legitimate aspiration of the East Timorese. President Habibie 
and General Wiranto must stop the violence and must allow international peace 
keepers to enter East Timor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian government promised the United Nations 
and the international community that it would ensure the safety and security of 
East Timorese before and after the referendum. If the Indonesian government cannot 
or will not keep this commitment, I believe we must support an international peace 
keeping presence in East Timor. I also hope the Senate will act quickly on the 
important legislation introduced by Senator Feingold yesterday. We must not allow 
the Indonesian government to continue to receive US military and economic assistance 
as long as it condones, if not fans, the terror taking place now in East Timor.
