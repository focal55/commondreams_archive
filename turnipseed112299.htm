An Opportunity For Racial Understanding And Reconciliation</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
By Tom Turnipseed<br>
November 22, 1999</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">Columbia, 
S.C. --The Confederate Flag debate in South Carolina offers an opportunity for
understanding and racial reconciliation that can bridge the great divide
of racism in the United States.  The  Lincoln-Douglas debates ignited
the fires of freedom that led to the election of Lincoln as President,
the Civil War, and the Emancipation of African-Americans from abject
slavery. The Confederate Battle Flag debate is about the continuing
symbol of a defeated Dixie, Jim Crow, civil rights defiance, and white
supremacy, that flies in sovereignty from atop the South Carolina State
House.  The flag is being challenged by anti-racist forces led by the
NAACP with its economic sanctions.<br>
<br>
This focuses the debate on the crux of racism in America-----the
historical economic exploitation of African-Americans based on skin
color---- and even remedies to right centuries of racial wrongs.  Only
an empathetic understanding by white folks of the continuing economic
oppression suffered by African-Americans from their days of slave labor
to contemporary covert corporate color bias, inferior educational
opportunity, and  income disparity based on color, can lead to real
racial reconciliation.<br>
<br>
The most frightening aspect to the more moderate folks who say that a
"compromise" must be made on the Flag to end the economic sanctions
employed by the NAACP which they say must end before a "deal" is made.
They call for an end to this "painful" debate while nervously noticing
the negotiations for billions of dollars in reparations being awarded by
the German government and German corporations to Jews who were "slave
laborers"in Nazis Germany and their descendants.<br>
<br>
I am a former racist-in-denial who was the National Campaign Director
for George Wallace's organization. We used all things Confederate to
glorify "Dixie" and mask the slave owning, racist culture that created
that white supremacist state. The Confederate Battle Flag has become
emblematic of white supremacy from rebel flag waving, Nazi Skin Heads in
Germany to church burning Klansmen in South Carolina and the Aryan
Nation in Idaho.<br>
<br>
When I developed an empathy for African-American history, my racist days
were over and for the past 25 years I've worked for racial justice. I am
the President of the Center For Democratic Renewal (CAR), (Formerly The
National Anti-Klan Network).  Julian Bond, National Chairman of the
NAACP, and Martin L. King, III, President of SCLC, are members of the
board of CAR and are actively involved in  economic strategies
concerning the Confederate Flag in South Carolina . The South Carolina
NAACP originated the economic sanctions and has successfully developed
them after they were passed by the national NAACP Convention and its
Board of Directors. More than 80 organizations have canceled meetings
scheduled in South Carolina.<br>
<br>
Honoring the tourism sanctions, the annual convention of the S. C. NAACP
was held in Charlotte, North  Carolina last month. A three hour tribute
to South Carolinian Nelson Rivers, III, the National Field Director,
recognized an outstanding civil rights leader whose passion and
pragmatism have propelled him to a national leadership role in the civil
rights movement.  Corporate executives of Michelin and Advantica made
brief presentations of gifts to Nelson and it's interesting because both
have been mentioned as prime targets for economic sanctions against
their products nationwide.  Nelson graciously accepted their gifts after
they presented themselves as great believers in the NAACP, and civil
rights.<br>
<br>
Later Nelson mentioned the appropriateness of economic sanctions and
that  the power of economic choice and sacrifice would finally win the
struggle.  Nelson said the NAACP would do what it has to do to apply
sanctions on a national basis and that he or the NAACP "could not be
bought".  It was interesting to see big corporate folks pandering and
paternalistically "giving gifts" in fear of such sanctions and to
observe Nelson's candor and integrity in reply.<br>
<br>
Governor Jim Hodges was elected with an overwhelming black voter
turnout. Later the media reported he met with flag supporters during the
election and promised them he would take no initiatives to bring the
flag down.  Flag supporters had previously voted overwhelmingly
Republican but were disillusioned with Republican Governor David Beasley
who made an attempt to remove the flag but was blocked by the Republican
House of Representatives.  The Democratic Party at each of it's past few
State Conventions and at the most recent State Executive Committee
meeting in October voted unanimously to work to bring the flag down.<br>
<br>
With polls showing an increasing majority of South Carolinians favoring
lowering the flag, including powerful organizations like the S.C.
Baptist  Convention and the State Chamber of Commerce Hodges was chided
by Rivers last week to "be a man" and exercise leadership to get the
flag down.  Increasingly, progressive citizens whose active support is
critical for his re-election are concerned about Hodges' reticence.  As
in the time of Lincoln, it's time for leadership of vision and courage.
