WASHINGTON: The United
        Nations has sounded an alarm over the use of cluster
        bombs by American aircraft attacking Afghanistan, saying
        eight people died in a Herat village by dozens of
        unexploded orange-colored&quot;bomblets&quot; littering
        roads and fields.</font>

</table></font>Official said the
        cluster bomb dropped on the Herat village had left a
        village strewn with deadly unexploded
        &quot;bomblets.&quot; The official said eight people from
        the village had been killed in the American attack which
        leaves people trapped in their homes. UN staff has sought
        information from the US military about munitions dropped
        at the village of Shaker Qala, and other locations, said
        a UN spokesperson. &quot;Vehicles and pushcarts took an
        unconfirmed number of casualties ... to the main hospital
        in Heart,&quot; she said. Cluster bombs are dropped in a
        casing which splits open in mid-air, scattering up to 200
        bomblets the size of soft drink cans. They are used to
        destroy vehicles, to start fires and as an anti-personnel
        weapon. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes they descend
        with mini-parachutes designed to prevent explosion on
        impact, so that they deny the enemy the use of an area
        such as an airfield. Shaker Qala lies near a military
        camp. &quot;The villagers have a lot to be afraid of,
        because these bomblets, if they did not explode, are very
        dangerous,&quot; Dan Kelly, manager of a UN mine removal
        program for Afghanistan, was quoted as saying by local
        media. &quot;They can explode if the villagers so much as
        touch them.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United Nations
        report of the cluster bomb - a weapon used by American
        forces in every war since Vietnam that has frequently
        caused civilian deaths - was the latest of a growing
        number of accounts of American bombs going astray and
        causing civilian casualties. At the United Nations
        briefing where the incident involving the cluster bomb
        was disclosed, spokesmen said the Taliban had moved six
        tanks into another village outside Herat after an
        American bombing raid during the weekend. Afghans
        reaching Quetta said two villagers had died when five of
        the six tanks were struck in a subsequent American
        attack. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A UN official Dan Kelly
        was quoted as saying that Afghan employees of the
        program in Herat had gone to Shaker Qala, the village
        where the cluster bomb hit, to place sandbags around the
        bomblets and to clear paths that would allow villagers to
        leave their homes. Kelly said the description of the
        bomblets given over the radio from Herat suggested that
        the bomb appeared to have been of a type designed to
        scatter bomblets over an area of 20 football fields. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said that the
        bomblets, carried to the ground on small parachutes,
        contained a &quot;shaped charge&quot; capable of
        penetrating armored steel up to five inches thick. These
        bomblets, he said, are usually used for attacks on
        armored vehicles, troop concentrations, bunkers and
        other dispersed targets. </font></p>

</table></font>But they are deadly even
        if they fall to the ground unexploded, because their
        small size and bright color make them intriguing to
        passers-by, especially children. In more than 20 years of
        war, thousands of Afghan children have been killed or
        maimed by bomblets left over from Soviet bombing of
        guerrilla groups in the 1980's. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelly appealed to the
        Pentagon to provide the United Nations with details of
        the payload, height and speed of the aircraft that
        dropped the cluster bomb. That would enable the
        mine-removal team to determine the &quot;footprint&quot;
        of the bomb and the area to search for the bomblets. With
        nearly 300 square miles of Afghanistan already taken up
        by uncleared minefields from the 22 years of Soviet
        military occupation and civil war, he said, &quot;the
        last thing Afghanistan needs right now is more unexploded
        mines and bombs.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the American raids
        began 18 days ago, bombing mistakes have been reported
        almost daily. In one early case, a targeting error caused
        a bomb to strike a United Nations mine-removal office in
        Kabul, killing four Afghan employees. No confirmation of
        the two Herat strikes, the one involving the cluster bomb
        and the one near the mosque, was immediately available
        from the Pentagon, which has acknowledged several
        accidental strikes on civilian targets. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cluster bombs dropped by
        US warplanes on a village in western Afghanistan killed
        nine civilians and forced the survivors to abandon their
        homes, the United Nations said Thursday here in
        Islamabad. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UN spokeswoman Stephanie
        Bunker told a press conference in Islamabad that eight
        people were killed straight away in Monday night's attack
        on the village near the city of Herat and a ninth was
        killed after picking up one of the bombs. Another 14
        people were injured, she said, and 20 of the 45 houses in
        the village were partially or completely destroyed.
        Bunker said local staff from the UN demining program
        had visited the village -- which she identified as Shaker
        Qala -- after the attack. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They reported that
        eight civilians were killed directly in the attack and
        that one civilian was killed -- as happens in these cases
        -- when he went to look at the object, touched it and it
        blew up,&quot; she said. &quot;They have determined there
        were 45 homes in that village, 20 of the homes were
        partially or completely destroyed in the attack.
        &quot;The rest of the population decided to voluntarily
        evacuate and have gone into Herat.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bunker said the
        survivors were only able to leave the village after the
        deminers made a path with sandbags for boundaries so the
        people fleeing did not touch any of the remaining bombs.
        The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund said as well
        as the immediate deadly impact of the bombs, many of them
        did not explode on impact and could kill innocent
        civilians years later. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There's already a
        framework of international humanitarian law that is very
        clearly defined,&quot; Hossain told reporters in
        Islamabad. &quot;Whoever is conducting those operations
        are under a legal obligation to comply.&quot; Hossain
        said international law stated maximum care must be taken
        to avoid civilian casualties and damage to
        non-combatants. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said the UN would
        monitor the US-led forces to ensure their actions
        complied with international law. But he would not be
        drawn on whether the dropping of cluster bombs on Shaker
        Qala or other US air strike blunders that have killed
        civilians during the 19-day military campaign had
        breached international law. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
According to earlier UN
        reports, a hospital and mosque in a military compound
        within one kilometer (mile) of Shaker Qala were also hit
        in the same series of raids. Bunker said Thursday the UN
        still stood by its reports, despite the United States
        refusing to acknowledge that the village, hospital or
        mosque had been hit. She said there were
        &quot;casualties&quot; from the attacks on the hospital
        and mosque, but was unable to give any more details
.
