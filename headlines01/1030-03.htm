CAIRO --
The students of Cairo University held a protest earlier this month. 
Mounted against the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan, it was, like everything 
even remotely political in Egypt, nothing so much as controlled.
<P>The students chanted. The police looked on. But the heady satisfaction of 
giving voice to conviction remained securely contained within university gates, which remained closed throughout the midday demonstration.
<P>"Inside the university, people are very free, but outside they're very 
secretive," said Moustafa Mahmoud, a science student. "If a person can't give 
his opinions, there's a lot of fear in him, and it will make him move 
underground."
<P>In searching for the origins of Islamic extremism in the Arab world, many 
analysts point to the considerable restraints that autocratic governments 
impose on political expression. Without Western recognition of a single Arab 
government as a real democracy, and without serious opposition brooked in most 
of them, frustrated activists say dissent has been channeled into the only 
arena that remains relatively open -- religion.
<P>"Politics is prohibited in this society in general," said Hafez Abu Saada, 
secretary general of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, which the 
government has refused to give legal standing. "But the government can't close 
the mosque. If you can't gather people to discuss issues in the appropriate 
place, such as the headquarters of the opposition party, the only place you 
can gather people is the mosque."
<P>The rise of "political Islam" has many roots, analysts note, including the 
guidelines for political behavior in the Koran. The prophet Mohammed's call 
for shura, or consultation between the ruler and the ruled, has been called in 
the Muslim world the "essence" of democracy. Modern political Islam is 
sometimes influenced as well by many Muslims' perception of Western 
institutions and culture as hollow.
<P>Egypt, with 70 million people, is by far the largest Arab country and among 
the most closely aligned with the West. It has a parliament, but opposition 
parties hold few seats; the ruling National Party is answerable mainly to the 
military-backed government of President Hosni Mubarak.
<P>Criticism of government policies is allowed, but challenges to reform the 
fundamentals of the system are discouraged, sometimes with force and prison 
terms. With firm control of parliament and the electoral system, Mubarak has 
faced no substantial electoral challenge to his authority in 20 years.
<P>In that political environment, ordinary citizens and activists say the 
absence of any other outlet for civic expression leads increasing numbers of 
people to view religion as the frame for politics. And for a small minority, 
politics includes terrorism.
<P>"Of course losing your freedom attracts you to being violent," said Mohamad 
Al-Hodhaibi, a senior official of the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that 
originally sprang up against British colonial rule. The Brotherhood, which 
though technically outlawed manages to field candidates for parliament using 
the slogan "Islam is the Solution," is widely regarded here as the most 
formidable internal opposition to Mubarak's government.
<P>A Western diplomat who tracks radical groups said extremism tends to be 
rooted in illiteracy and poverty, especially in Upper Egypt, the hinterlands 
upstream on the Nile.
<P>"These organizations that recruit people are offering people either a 
better life or a better afterlife," the diplomat said. "If they had more 
political dialogue here, would they still have terrorism? I personally believe 
they would still have terrorism."
<P>The diplomat was less dismissive of the contention that U.S. support for 
unpopular Arab governments fuels the widespread impression that the United 
States regards Arabs as second-class citizens.
<P>"Democracy for the Jews," Saada, the human rights official, said of Israel, 
"but not for the Arabs."
<P>Cairo residents acknowledge their frustration warily.
<P>"Shall I say my opinion? I won't be arrested? Because anyone who says their 
opinion gets arrested," said Farid Sayed Ibrahim, one of a dozen unemployed 
men idling outside a mosque in Cairo's Nasser City neighborhood. "If I say the 
truth they'll take us all in a group out of here."
<P>Saada, also a human rights attorney, said the mosque was near the location 
where Egyptian security forces had swept up about 70 suspected Muslim radicals 
a month earlier, charging them with raising money for extremist causes. Police 
said they were members of a new group called Al Waad, Arabic for "the Promise,
" that an Egyptian newspaper linked to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist 
organization.
<P>The unemployed men said they knew nothing of the arrests or the group.
<P>Western diplomats dismissed the reported link to al Qaeda, as well as 
reports that the group plotted against U.S. targets in Egypt. Saada, who is 
representing one of the group's alleged leaders, said two suspects who the 
government announced had been trained as pilots had in fact been arrested well 
before the sweep against Al Waad.
<P>Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, worshipers have been urged 
to leave their mosques immediately after Friday prayers, rather than linger in 
groups, lest they form the core of a protest. University students say they get 
the same rush treatment when a class ends.
<P>The demonstrations that offer young idealists at least the opportunity to 
vent do not satisfy the craving for real political involvement, several 
students said in interviews.
