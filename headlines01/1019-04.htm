<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - The 1990s will go down as the decade of  
calamities despite being declared the ''International Decade for  
Natural Disaster Reduction'' by the United Nations, says a report  
released here Thursday. 
<P>
The decade saw 86 major natural catastrophes - including floods,  
earthquakes and hurricanes - that required outside assistance  
because of extensive deaths, said the Washington-based <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org" target="_new">Worldwatch  
Institute</a>. By contrast, there were only 20 such events in the  
1950s and 47 in the 1970s. 
<P>
Natural disasters caused more than 608 billion dollars in economic  
losses during the 1990s - about five times the figure in the 1970s  
and 15 times the total for the 1950s, said the environmental think- 
tank. 
<P>
Why the increase? Janet Abramovitz, a senior researcher at  
Worldwatch who authored the 62-page report, argued part of the  
reason is that a growing share of the devastation wrought by  
natural disasters, like floods and hurricanes, is ''unnatural'' in  
origin, caused by destruction to ecosystems. 
<P>
''We have altered so many natural systems so dramatically, their  
ability to protect us from disturbances is greatly diminished,''  
she said 
<P>
The clear-cutting of forests, re-routing of rivers, filling in of  
wetlands, and destabilization of the global climate is leading to  
the unraveling of a complex ecological safety net, warned the  
report, 'Unnatural Disasters.' 
<P>
Asia has been hardest hit by natural disasters, it said, because  
the region is large and storms, floods and earthquakes frequently  
hit heavily populated coastal areas. 
<P>
According to data collected by Munich Re, a German-based  
international reinsurance company, 77 percent of the nearly  
561,000 people who died in natural disasters between 1985 and 1999  
were in Asia. Approximately 45 percent of all recorded economic  
losses during the same period, which includes the first two years  
of the 'Asian financial crisis', were attributed to natural  
disasters. 
<P>
Some of the more devastating recent natural disasters have been in  
India. In 1998, a cyclone in the state of Gujarat claimed the  
lives of 10,000 people, while the following year as many as 50,000  
people died when a ''supercyclone'' hit Orissa state. 
<P>
Munich Re reported that 10 percent of the fatalities between 1985  
and 1999 were in South America, while four percent were in Central  
America and four percent in Africa. Less than four percent of the  
fatalities were in industrial countries, including European  
nations and the United States. 
<P>
''While poor countries are more vulnerable, in every nation some  
people and communities - notably the very poor, women and ethnic  
minorities - are especially hard hit during and after disasters,''  
it said. 
<P>
The good news is that single natural disasters are causing fewer  
deaths than in earlier decades. ''It was not uncommon,'' said  
Abramovitz, ''to lose hundreds of thousands of lives in a single  
great catastrophe.'' 
<P>
Early warnings and disaster preparedness, along with advances in  
sanitation and clean water, have helped keep the fatalities lower  
than in the past, she added. 
<P>
While the death toll per event has declined in recent decades,  
however, the number of people impacted has grown, according to the  
report. More people worldwide, it said, are now displaced by  
natural disasters than by conflict. 
<P>
''In the last decade over two billion people worldwide have been  
affected by disasters, about 211 million people per year,'' said  
the report, which acknowledged that some of these people may be  
affected and counted more than once. Ninety percent of people  
impacted were in Asia and six percent in Africa. 
<P>
The ever-rising human and economic toll of disasters means that a  
profound shift is needed in how disasters are approached, said the  
report. Most attempts to address natural disasters, it argued,  
wrongly focus on disaster response and recovery or on scientific  
and technical solutions. 
<P>
Instead, it urged governments and international institutions to  
reexamine development choices that have made the threats worse. 
<P>
''While we cannot do away with natural hazards, we can eliminate  
those that we cause, minimize those we exacerbate, and reduce our  
vulnerability to most,'' said Worldwatch. 
<P>
Current development trends that make people vulnerable to natural  
disasters - pressure on ecosystems and concentration of people and  
infrastructure along coasts and in cities - are growing, it added. 
<P>
''Many ecosystems have been frayed to the point where they are no  
longer resilient and able to withstand natural disturbances,  
setting the stage for ''unnatural disasters'' - those made more  
frequent or more severe due to human actions,'' it said. 
<P>
Deforestation, for example, impairs watersheds, raises the risk of  
fires, and contributes to climate change, it said. Destruction of  
coastal wetlands, dunes, and mangroves eliminates ''nature's shock  
absorbers'' for coastal storms. 
<P>
''Such human-made changes end up making naturally vulnerable areas -  
such as hillsides, rivers, coastal zones, and low-lying islands -  
even more vulnerable to extreme weather events,'' the report said. 
<P>
Critical to redirecting disaster mitigation strategies,  
governments and donors need to focus more on maintaining and  
restoring healthy ecosystems, it argued. Much can be learned from  
China, which now recognizes that forests are more valuable for  
flood control and water supply than for timber. 
<P>
In response to deadly floods in 1998, China banned logging in the  
upper Yangtze watershed, prohibited additional land reclamation  
projects in the river's floodplain, and stepped up efforts to  
reforest the watershed. 
<P>
Mangrove restoration efforts in Vietnam also are under way to help  
prevent storm damage to the coast. The 2,000 hectares of mangroves  
successfully acted as a buffer against frequent coastal storms,  
said the report. 
<P>
When the area was hit by the worst typhoon in a decade, there was  
no significant damage, it noted. 
<P>
''If we instead choose to work with nature and each other, we can  
reduce the waves of unnatural disasters that have been washing  
over the shores of humanity with increasing regularity and  
ferocity,'' said Abramovitz.</P>
