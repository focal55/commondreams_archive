QUEBEC CITY  - A massive banner goes up the front
walls of a tall
office building here, reading: 'SOS - message of resistance
against economic
dictatorship'. 
<P>
Around the corner, the golden arches and the conspicuous yellow
letters of the
fast food chain McDdonalds have been removed by its owners to
conceal the
shop's presence, but the outline of the word still needs to be
washed off. <P>
''This is to keep out the hooligans,'' says a workman as he puts
up a
shield on
the windows of the fourth shop he has worked on Wednesday in this
particular
block.  <P>

</table></font>He is rushing to catch another job ahead of the competition in
what has proven
brisk business here this week - covering shop windows with wooden
sheets to
conceal any signs of corporate globalisation. <P>
The reason: Quebec is the venue of another anti-globalisation
battle this week
when 34 heads of state of all of the nations of the Americas,
except Cuba,
meet
at the Summit of the Americas where they are expected to endorse
negotiations
for the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). <P>
The biggest police presence ever seen in this tiny city of a
little more
than a
half a million people - some 6,000 officers - and a 4.5 kilometre
metal fence
anchored in concrete, tell the tale of a city under siege. By the
end of the
week, some 30,000 people are expected to swarm into this walled
city to oppose
the agreement. <P>
''Instead of fighting poverty, our governments placed a priority
on
negotiating
trade deals,'' notes the Hemispheric Social Alliance (HSA), a 45-
million
strong
civil society network from across the region that is hosting the
People's
Summit, an alternative forum to the Summit of the Americas. <P>
''They believe that free trade and the market will solve the
problem of
underdevelopment ... that globalisation is an irreversible process
that
will be
good for all of us in the long run, yet even the richest countries
are
undergoing cuts to hard-won social welfare services.'' <P>
The reality of the majority of the region's population is best
described by
the
terms unemployment, social exclusion, human rights violations,
destruction of
the environment, discrimination against women, child labour,
illiteracy and
the
dismantling of public services. <P>
HSA argues that the acronym 'FTAA' does not rhyme with
'democracy', neither
does it rhyme with 'sustainable development' and this will be
played out on
the streets of Quebec this week when police and demonstrators who
want the
FTAA
negotiations to be transparent and accountable to the region's 750
million
people converge on the streets of Quebec this weekend.  <P>
The negotiations have thus far been conducted in secrecy, but it
is expected
that the draft text of the agreement will be released here this
week as
government's bow to civic pressure. <P>
Civil society groups are suspicious of a negotiation process that
has so far
only been open to government and business leaders. They have
described the
FTAA
as a way of bringing back the discredited Multilateral Agreement
on Investment
(MAI) and of expanding the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA)
into the
rest
of Latin America. <P>
''The FTAA is the son of MAI, which in turn is the son of NAFTA,''
says Konrad
Von Moltke of International Institute for Sustainable Development
(IISD).
''Any
new trade agreement that does not promote climate-friendly
investment is
simply
unacceptable.'' <P>
Civil society groups have come a long way since 1994 when NAFTA
was adopted by
Canada, Mexico and the United States. Then, the implications of
Chapter 11 of
the agreement were still too obscure. Chapter 11 is now the
catalyst for
anti-FTAA protests. <P>
It allows corporations to seek private arbitration against
governments and so
far at least 15 known cases have been launched, allowing
contesting parties to
choose who the arbitrating judges would be or whether or not to
allow public
access to the proceedings. <P>
All three governments have been sued. Companies have challenged a
variety of
state actions such as environmental protection policies, and the
damages
sought
have exceeded 18 billion dollars. <P>
In one instance, the Canadian government issued a ban that stopped
a US-based
company, SD Meyers, from importing waste contaminated with PCBs
from Canada
between November 1995 and February 1997. During this brief period,
the United
States opened its borders to PCBs, which are among the most highly
toxic
industrial wastes. <P>
SD Meyers is now demanding damages to cover lost profit during
that period
which could amount to 50 million dollars arguing that the Canadian
government
deprived it of its right to invest in the PCB disposal market in
that country. <P>
Canadian government officials have argued that they were merely
carrying out
their duties under the Basel Convention, an international protocol
which
encourages countries to limit the export of hazardous waste.
Canada does not
permit the disposal of PCBs in landfills while the United States
does. <P>
''While Canadians say yes we have to carry on with free trade with
the rest of
the region, at the same time they are beginning to say we have to
give more
importance to social issues,'' says Henri Masse, a Canadian
national who
chairs
the People's Summit. His government has been the leading proponent
of the
FTAA. <P>
''Perhaps you may think I believe in Santa Claus but I believe we
need to work
out a model that for instance, allows for redistribution of
resources during
times of good economic growth as we have had during the last
decade, that
respects worker rights and that contains environmental provisions.
We cannot
trade away the environment.'' <P>
If it comes into force as envisioned by 2005, the FTAA will become
the world's
biggest free trade area, linking countries that currently produce
11 trillion
dollars' worth of goods and generate 3.4 trillion dollars of world
trade. <P>
''While the FTAA faces many difficulties it also offers a number
of
opportunities,'' Juan Carlos Chavez of PRISMA, a Bolivian
institute that
specialises in international relations and the environment told a
three-day
environmental symposium held here ahead of the Summit of the
Americas. <P>
''An opportunity to conceive a free trade treaty based on
principles like the
promotion of incentive systems aimed at producing goods that are
environmentally safe and produce them in a socially responsible
manner.''
