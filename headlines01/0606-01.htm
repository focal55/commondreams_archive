These are flush times for the city's Department of Water and Power and 
the energy executives are loving every minute of it.
<P>As are their customers.
<P>Private power companies throughout California have been raising rates and 
warning customers about a long, hot summer filled with blackouts, but the city-
owned DWP has been keeping prices stable and the lights on for 1.2 million Los 
Angeles customers.
<P>"Our customers are being really nice to us," said Angelina Galiteva, the 
utility's strategic planning director. "They love the DWP."
<P>Although Gov. Gray Davis' administration announced that the state had 
reduced its energy consumption 11 percent from a year ago, those in Los 
Angeles had cut back less than half that -- and polls show they view the 
energy situation less seriously than other Californians.
<P>Public utilities such as Los Angeles water and power have seen their 
revenues increase during the energy crunch because they can sell their excess 
power at higher prices than ever before in a market tilted toward sellers.
<P>The rest of the state doesn't always feel that same warm glow. Davis has 
accused the DWP and other California public utilities of putting exorbitant 
price tags on the excess electricity they sell to the rest of the energy-
starved state.
<P>It's a charge Los Angeles utility executives deny, arguing that their 
excess power is sold at cost plus 15 percent, which they say is a fair return 
for their customers.
<P>"Without our support, a million more homes (elsewhere in California) would 
have suffered rolling blackouts, which is a powerful message," Galiteva said.
<P>It wasn't supposed to be this way. When the power industry was deregulated 
in the late '90s, energy giants like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison were expected to be the big winners. Now, PG&E is in 
bankruptcy and Edison is a short step away.
<P>"When deregulation came, the experts said that the investor-owned utilities 
would become lean, mean machines that would be better able to operate in the 
new environment," Galiteva said. "But now public power has shown it can serve 
customers more efficiently at lower rates."
<P>While much of the state worries about electrical supply, Los Angeles 
residents have been saved many of those concerns.
<P>In a survey done last month by the Public Policy Institute of California, 
48 percent of the people in the Bay Area thought that electricity cost and 
availability were the most important issues facing the state. In Los Angeles, 
however, only 33 percent put the energy crunch on top. When questioned about 
the size of the power problem and the effect it would have on the state's 
economy, Los Angeles residents were consistently less concerned than people 
elsewhere in California.
<P>People in Los Angeles have been "somewhat isolated" from the energy crisis, 
concluded Mark Baldassare, who conducted the survey.
<P>That doesn't mean the state's energy problems haven't had an effect. The 
DWP has seen a 3 percent to 5 percent reduction in some uses, which officials 
have dubbed "sympathy conservation." The utility also is offering its biggest 
customers financial incentives to cut back on their power use.
<P>"Our average annual load growth is about 80 megawatts," Galiteva said. "By 
this summer, we expect to have saved 40 megawatts through conservation. By 
December, we expect 60 megawatts in savings."
<P>The utility also is making a major attempt to create a conservation ethic 
among its customers. DWP's comfortable situation has made it possible to offer 
them the carrot without the need to show them the stick.
<P>"Conservation no longer means doing without," Galiteva said. "Beer can be 
just as cold with a superefficient refrigerator. Rooms can be just as bright 
with superefficient light bulbs."
<P>A "Green Power" program also is promoting the use of renewable energy 
resources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. About 75,000 customers 
are paying an extra $3 per month to increase DWP's use of renewable power 
sources.
<P>"We're trying to give our customers a choice and a voice in determining the 
mix of power they use," Galiteva said. "They know they can do (conservation) 
now or see it being mandated later."
<P>Los Angeles power officials -- and their customers -- know the DWP isn't 
always going to continue as an island of tranquility in a sea of energy 
turmoil. The utility's aging gas-fired plants have been affected by the rising 
price of natural gas. Demand for energy continues to rise. In a debate last 
month, both candidates for mayor of Los Angeles agreed that increases in local 
power bills are inevitable.
<P>But the DWP has been supplying power to Los Angeles since 1916, and its 
executives believe that the state's deregulation disaster has shown the 
advantages of the city-owned utility.
<P>"It's nice to be the lean, mean, green efficient machine that no one ever 
expected us to become," Galiteva said.
