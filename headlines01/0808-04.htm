WARREN, N.J., Aug. 7 &#0151; Susanna Thomas called home this morning from the Italian jail where she has been held since her arrest outside Genoa on July 22, hours after the end of the summit meeting of the major industrialized nations and the street disorder that swirled around it.

Susanna Thomas, 21, of Warren, N.J., shown in a photo taken in Amsterdam, Netherlands June 22, 2001, was arrested in the wake of last month's G8 summit protests in Genoa, Italy. Her parents, Rick and Cathy Thomas, have chalked up hours of phone and Internet talks with the U.S. Embassy, their two U.S. Senators and attorneys they've retained on two continents as well as an international network of fellow Quakers while working for her release.

</font>It was the first time her parents, Cathy and Rick, had heard her voice since she called them shortly before her arrest, saying she was leaving Genoa and going to the beach with some friends and then heading to France to catch a flight home. 
<P> The young woman's call today gave her parents and their older daughter, Helen, a welcome 10- minute respite in their two-and-a- half-week ordeal.</p>
<P> "She sounded scared," Mrs. Thomas said. "And she was concerned about the others arrested with her. She feels they're all innocent."</p>
<P> Instead of preparing for her senior year at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, Ms. Thomas, 21, described as a devout Quaker and an ardent foe of the death penalty, is facing a possible 15-year sentence. </p>
<P> The charge against her is conspiring with a group to commit devastation and plundering during the Genoa meeting, said the family's lawyer, Dick Atkins of Philadelphia. Mr. Atkins called the charge ludicrous.</p>
<P> He said that Ms. Thomas, who had e-mailed her parents that she was avoiding the rowdy demonstrations in Genoa, left town afterward with 25 members of an Austrian protest group called Publix Theatre. Most were on a bus, the lawyer said; Ms. Thomas was in a car.</p>

</font>After the arrest, police confiscated two penknives and a black bra from the car, Mr. Atkins said. He said Italian authorities were apparently trying to establish a link between Ms. Thomas and an anarchist group, the Black Bloc, whose members wear black. The group clashed with the police in Genoa.
<P> New Jersey's senators, Robert G. Torricelli and Jon S. Corzine, have written to the American charg&#0233; d'affaires in Rome, William P. Pope, asking him to intercede with the Italian authorities. </p>
<P> Ms. Thomas's imprisonment is a jarring end to a semester of studying art, theology and politics at the Jesuit University in Paris, with some side trips to meet with Quaker groups and determine if there is common ground between their church, with its tenet of nonviolence, and more radical groups promoting social activism in Europe. She had hoped to develop that theme into her senior thesis at Bryn Mawr, where she is majoring in urban planning.</p>

</font>The Thomas family dining room is now a makeshift communications hub. The parents have sent hundreds of e-mails to Quakers throughout the country and Europe appealing for prayers for their daughter. Boxes are filled with replies and copies of a brief biography of their daughter and other documents describing her devotion to community service, including a year's duty with AmeriCorps from 1997 to 1998 in the southeastern United States. The fruit and vegetable drawers from the refrigerator sit on a dining room table, overflowing with paperwork.
<P> "I'm concerned about our child's safety," Mrs. Thomas said. "But I'm also saddened and concerned about all the people involved. I'm just so sorry this whole thing turned out so badly."</p>
