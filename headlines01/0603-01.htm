Eager to placate environmentalists, the Duke Energy Corp. agreed to pay 
more than $12 million to Monterey Bay area groups whose objections could have 
scuttled the controversial expansion of its Moss Landing power plant, destined 
to be the state's largest.
<P>Most of the groups are now being accused of taking financial advantage of 
the situation and betraying their mission as environmentalists to defend the 
Monterey Bay area's fragile harbors, sloughs and wetlands. The environmental 
groups protested until Duke put up money, then dropped their opposition.
<P>The result, opponents say, is that the very things the groups originally 
protested, including the discharge of heated water into fragile aquatic 
environments, will still happen.
<P>Donna Solomon, co-owner of Solomon Live Fish in Moss Landing, fears that 
the heated exhaust water will shrink catches of two commercially important 
fish, cabezon and bolina.
<P>"They say they are environmentalists, but they are not -- they are frauds," 
Solomon said of the groups.
<P>The funds include $8 million for "monitoring" environmental quality and for 
land acquisition -- an amount dwarfing the nonprofit groups' budgets, in some 
cases.
<P>The fighting that broke out at the local level over Moss Landing, energy-
industry critics say, is an inevitable consequence of authorities' failure to 
establish a broad, coherent energy policy and their desperate search for quick 
fixes to the crisis.
<P>The deals, critics add, were a predictable corporate response to a 
situation that invited financial exploitation.
<P>"Local groups quickly succumb to corporate money," said Doug Heller, a 
consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in 
Santa Monica. "When we become dependent on them to take up statewide issues, 
the corporation is given the upper hand."
<P>Two prominent Monterey County politicians took part in behind-the-scenes 
negotiations involving the 239-acre plant, sources who participated in the 
talks told The Chronicle.
<P>Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County), brokered a $1 
million deal between Duke and the four environmental groups. Keeley, who plans 
to run for the state Senate in 2004, has accepted donations from the energy 
industry in the past, but says he stopped accepting the industry's 
contributions in January, after assuming a leadership role in dealing with the 
crisis.
<P>County Supervisor Louis Calcagno pressed regulators to approve the power 
plant and held a meeting called to devise a way to transfer $3.4 million from 
Duke to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce. Calcagno is a Moss Landing 
dairyman with substantial agricultural, commercial and residential properties. 
He acknowledges that those holdings could grow in value as a result of Duke-
funded projects in the area.
<P>"There was money all around," said Gary Shallcross, chairman of the Central 
Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.
<P>Environmentalists who negotiated with Duke say they made the best of a bad 
situation. Rather than fight a project they believed likely to get speedy 
approval regardless of what they did, they accepted money from Duke. They 
contend that the funds will be used to benefit the environment.
<P>"The bottom line is, we were looking at a locomotive coming down the track,
" said Steve Shimek of the Otter Project in Marina, one of the groups that 
negotiated with Duke. "We made the decision to do the best we could. Do I 
wonder if we did the right thing? I question myself."
<P>The three other groups that opposed Duke, then made a deal with the energy 
company, are Save Our Shores and the Center for Marine Conservation, both in 
Santa Cruz, and Friends of the Sea Otter in Pacific Grove.
<P></p>
<b>GROUPS WAIVE RIGHT TO SUE</b>
<P>Although fierce initially, key opposition to Duke vanished between the late 
summer and Nov. 6 -- when a document laying out the company's agreement to pay 
for "monitoring" and additional "mitigation" was finalized.
<P>The environmental groups agreed by that date that they would "not 
participate in any lawsuit, regulatory challenge, regulatory appeal or any 
other action . . . that might obstruct, delay, or prevent Duke's construction" 
of the plant.
<P>This contrasted with a Sept. 22 letter to the Regional Water Quality 
Control Board in which they said they were "deeply concerned" about impacts; 
had "serious reservations" about the amount of money Duke agreed to put up, to 
that point, to offset damage; and "strongly" believed the company should do 
more.
<P>The Moss Landing plant will be the state's largest after its completion 
next summer. With an output of 2,538 megawatts, it's expected to account for 
30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next year, serving 
about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and southern Santa 
Clara County areas, including San Jose.
<P>At issue for the environmentalists is Duke's intention to use a relatively 
cheap "once-through" cooling system as part of the modernization and expansion 
project.
<P>The cooling system would suck up to 1.2 billion gallons of salt water a day 
out of Moss Landing Harbor and two of the state's ecological gems, Elkhorn 
Slough and Monterey Bay. This amount would cover nearly 3,700 acres of land to 
a one-foot depth.
<P>Duke contends that "once-through" is cleaner than lower-impact alternatives 
costing tens of millions of dollars more. The company also says studies show 
its impact on marine organisms won't be unacceptably high. Environmentalists 
uniformly disagreed.
<P>About two things, however, there has been no dispute.
<P>The "once-through" process will exterminate a substantial portion of the 
aquatic food chain, chiefly the smallest organisms, before the slightly 
chlorinated water is returned to Elkhorn Slough, nearby Moro Cojo Slough, Moss 
Landing Harbor and Monterey Bay.
<P>Moreover, the process will allow the discharge of large amounts of water 
600 feet offshore in Monterey Bay at temperatures up to 20 degrees warmer than 
natural water temperatures.
<P>For some of the delicate organisms that survive the previous stages of the 
process, this may mean the equivalent of death by boiling. As one 
environmentalist told regulators, " 'Cooling water' is a euphemism . . . 
'Heated exhaust water' is a more accurate description."
<P>Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company did nothing wrong and 
contended that the expanded plant will be better for the environment than the 
current one. He said Duke had gone "the extra mile" to address community 
concerns.
<P>Madeleine Clark, a Prunedale environmentalist, disagrees. "In Monterey 
County, Duke can waltz in and buy everybody off, and everyone looks the other 
way," she said.
<P>A last-ditch challenge to the project by Clark and other protesting 
environmentalists will be heard by the State Water Resources Control Board in 
Sacramento on Wednesday.
</p>
<b>DUKE'S DEALS</b>
<P>Duke acquired the 30-year-old, 1,478-megawatt gas-fired plant from Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co. in July 1998 as part of a half-billion dollar package, 
including plants in Oakland and Morro Bay (San Luis Obispo County).
<P>Five months later, the Charlotte, N.C., energy company announced plans to 
spend $475 million modernizing Moss Landing, a figure that would rise to $525 
million. This was followed by an application to the California Energy 
Commission for permission to add 1,060 megawatts.
<P>Despite environmentalist opposition, the project generally had an easy time 
of it in hearings before the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the 
state Energy Commission. When Duke broke ground on Nov. 16, about three weeks 
after the commission gave its final approval, the company had made the 
following side arrangements, totaling $12,435,000:
<P>-- $1 million, in five annual installments, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary 
Foundation "to monitor water quality in the Elkhorn Slough."
<P>This is the deal that sparked the controversy. The funds were obtained for 
the foundation by the four environmental groups that opposed Duke, then 
dropped their opposition when the company put up the money.
<P>An additional $425,000, in three annual installments, will be given to the 
foundation "to monitor the power plant's heated seawater discharge in the 
ocean." Most of the money will be used, the groups say, to pay experts to take 
water and marine-life tissue samplings for five years.
<P>-- $610,000 to local agencies for air-pollution control, marine mammal care 
and trail building.
<P>-- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation for land acquisition and 
management.
<P>Foundation Director Mark Silberstein said the money would be partly used to 
add to the 1,700 acres under the foundation's control and to pay for 
conservation chores such as removing weeds and planting native grasses.
<P>Some environmentalists don't consider Silberstein's plan genuine mitigation.
<P>Carolyn Nielson of Aptos, a foundation docent, quit in September after the $7 
million deal was announced.
<P>"The groups made a cynical decision that never again would there be an 
opportunity for such financial benefit," Nielson said.
<P>Supervisor Calcagno also could benefit from the Elkhorn Slough deal by 
selling property or property easements to the newly enriched foundation.
<P>He owns MoonGlow Dairy, a 110-acre farm adjoining the slough and the power 
plant. The farm includes a 22-acre pond frequented by bird-watchers.
<P>As chairman of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors last year, Calcagno 
went on record in state hearings supporting Duke. He also said he had 
confidence in the Elkhorn Slough Foundation's ability to use the company's 
money to benefit the environment (Calcagno had been one of the organization's 
founders).
<P>There's no indication that a transaction involving Calcagno and the 
foundation is imminent. But Silberstein didn't deny the possibility of an 
eventual deal.
<P>"You need a willing seller, and Lou Calcagno owns that property," he said. 
"The door is open."
<P>Calcagno said he would consider a transaction.
<P>"That will probably be in a long-range plan. There is no doubt about that," 
he said.
<P>-- $3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce, in 20 annual 
installments, for "infrastructure improvements," including power-line 
undergrounding, storm drains and street lighting.
<P>Here, too, Calcagno could benefit.
<P>Since the late 1980s, he has been planning a large commercial project on 
Highway 1, not far from Elkhorn Slough. The project has been dropped, but 
Calcagno still owns the land on which it would have been built, as well as 
stores and apartments nearby.
<P>Calcagno held a meeting at his office in Castroville last July to discuss 
how Moss Landing businesses would deal with the money Duke was offering, 
according to Jim Stillwell, harbormaster of the Moss Landing Harbor District.
<P>Stillwell -- who opposes the plant and contends that it will increase toxic 
sedimentation in the harbor -- said at the meeting that he believed the 
district was best suited to handle the money because it is authorized to 
undertake public works.
<P>He offered the district's services. He was rebuffed.
<P>"We proposed this," Stillwell said. "Next thing I know, they give it to the 
chamber."
<P>Calcagno confirmed the meeting and acknowledged that his properties could 
grow in value as a result of the Duke-funded projects chosen by the chamber, 
to which he belongs. He said, however, that he didn't care about the potential 
gains.
<P>"The Duke project in no way benefits me," he said. "I can't get out of my 
driveway when the traffic is coming in the morning."
<P></p>
<b>ASSEMBLYMAN BROKERS DEAL</b>
<P>The four groups that made the deal with Duke insist they won't benefit. But 
the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, which will benefit, has connections to 
at least two of the groups.
<P>Sanctuary Foundation President Warner Chabot of San Francisco is also 
regional director of the Center for Marine Conservation, which led the way in 
making the Duke deal. The Sanctuary Foundation, additionally, has accepted 
cash grants from both the Center for Marine Conservation and another party to 
the Duke accord, Friends of the Sea Otter, tax records show. Chabot said the 
links are of no significance.
<P>"The great conspiracy does not exist," he said.
<P>Vicki Nichols of Save Our Shores and Kaitilin Gaffney, Central Coast 
program director for the Center for Marine Conservation -- both parties to the 
Duke accord -- echoed Chabot.
<P>But Gaffney admitted that there had, in fact, been much coordination 
between the groups before reaching an agreement with Duke. Gaffney's group and 
the Otter Project demanded $3.75 million -- $750,000 a year for five years -- 
within a week of each other in late October. Gaffney said this had been 
planned.
<P>Duke countered with offers no higher than a few hundred thousand dollars, 
according to people who participated in the talks. As negotiations between 
Duke and the groups bogged down in early November, Assemblyman Keeley was 
asked to intervene.
<P>"Fred prevented what could have been a bloody negotiation," Nichols of Save 
Our Shores said. "When he came in on behalf of the environmental community, 
Duke listened."
<P>Keeley was no stranger to the energy industry. As speaker pro tem of the 
Assembly, he has been prominent in attempts to deal with the energy crisis. 
And state records show that he has received nearly $50,000 in campaign 
contributions from energy companies since 1998, including $5,500 from the Duke 
subsidiary running the company's power plant in San Luis Obispo County, Duke 
Energy Morro Bay. According to Keeley, the total amounted to less than 10 
percent of all the political contributions he received.
<P>"The things that drive me as a legislator are environmental protection, 
higher education and social justice," Keeley said, "and so when I get a call 
from two well-established environmental organizations saying we need help to 
get a better deal for the environment, I'm pleased to help."
