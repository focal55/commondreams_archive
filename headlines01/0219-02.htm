            LOS ANGELES — John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.- C.I.O., 
            gave an unusual do-or-die warning at a meeting of labor leaders here, 
            telling them that unless unions did far more to increase their ranks, 
            organized labor could drift into irrelevance. 
            <P> Union membership slipped last year, and Mr. Sweeney is so concerned 
              that unions are not doing more organizing that he has called a special 
              meeting of union presidents for next month to press them to redouble 
              their recruitment efforts.</P>
            <P> During his five years at labor's helm, Mr. Sweeney has made increasing 
              union membership his No. 1 goal. But he voiced frustration that 
              unions were organizing only about one-third of the one million workers 
              he said should be organized each year to restore labor's might.</P>
            <P> One A.F.L.-C.I.O. official quoted Mr. Sweeney as telling the nation's 
              union leaders at a closed-door meeting here, "Not only are the numbers 
              totally unsatisfactory, but if we don't begin to turn this around 
              quickly and almost immediately, the drift in the other direction 
              is going to make it virtually impossible to continue to exist as 
              a viable institution and to have any impact on the issues we care 
              about."</P>
            <P> The percentage of American workers belonging to unions fell to 
              13.5 percent from 13.9 percent last year. That is the lowest level 
              since the number of unionized workers peaked at 35 percent in the 
              1950's. Even though more than 16 million jobs have been created 
              since 1992, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the number 
              of union members nationwide has slipped by 200,000 since then, to 
              16.2 million. </P>
            <P> An ever-larger part of union organizing is in government and in 
              the service sector, including hotels and nursing homes. In contrast, 
              organizing has been sluggish in the manufacturing sector, partly 
              because of the fear that companies might close operations if they 
              are unionized.</P>
            <P> Labor leaders expressed concern that just 10 of the federation's 
              66 member unions were doing about 80 percent of the organizing, 
              while many unions continued to do little to attract more members. 
            </P>
            <P> "We have a very uneven situation in terms of unions that are committing 
              serious resources to organizing, and therefore the numbers end up 
              being completely unsatisfactory," said Mark Splain, the federation's 
              organizing director.</P>
            <P> Several union leaders at the meeting disclosed the closely kept 
              statistics detailing how many workers various unions told the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
              they had organized last year. </P>
            <P> The Service Employees International Union ranked first, reporting 
              that it had organized 70,000 workers last year. In a virtual tie 
              for second, the United Food and Commercial Workers and the International 
              Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said they had each organized about 
              50,000. Far smaller unions, including those representing painters, 
              roofers and hotel employees, won praise for doing a lot of organizing 
              in proportion to their size.</P>
            <P> The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, like the service employees 
              union, has about 1.4 million members, but the Teamsters organized 
              only 22,000 workers last year, less than one-third of what the service 
              employees reported. Union leaders said the Paper, Allied-Industrial, 
              Chemical and Energy Workers Union, with 275,000 members, reported 
              hardly any organizing.</P>
            <P> And three powerful manufacturing unions, which led the way in 
              organizing decades ago, are now doing only a modest amount. The 
              United Auto Workers reported organizing 22,000 workers last year, 
              the United Steelworkers of America about 15,000 and the International 
              Association of Machinists nearly 10,000.</P>
            <P> Kate Bronfenbrenner, research director at Cornell University's 
              school of labor relations, said some industrial unions appeared 
              to have grown discouraged about organizing because so many manufacturers 
              move operations overseas, or threaten to move them, if they become 
              unionized. She conducted a survey that found that managers at 70 
              percent of factories involved in organizing drives threaten to close 
              if workers decide to unionize. Workers often say such threats discourage 
              them from voting to join a union.</P>
            <P> Leo Gerard, the steelworkers' newly named president, said he saw 
              a simple explanation for why it was easier to organize workers in 
              government offices, hospitals and hotels than in factories.</P>
            <P> "You can't threaten to move the public sector out of Ohio," Mr. 
              Gerard said. "You can't threaten to move a hospital or nursing home 
              to Mexico or China."</P>
            <P> Mr. Gerard said the main reason unions were not organizing hundreds 
              of thousands more workers each year was the intense anti-union campaigns 
              run by employers. But business executives say more people are not 
              joining unions because many workers see unions as irrelevant and 
              unnecessary and union dues as too expensive.</P>
            <P> When Mr. Sweeney became the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president in 1995, 
              unions were organizing fewer than 100,000 workers a year. Thanks 
              in part to his prodding, they reported organizing 350,000 workers 
              last year, an increase that Mr. Sweeney said was good but not nearly 
              enough.</P>
            <P> The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that on a net basis unions 
              lost 200,000 members last year, partly because of layoffs, retirements 
              and factory closings. </P>
            <P> Several officials of the labor federation said they were convinced 
              that some labor leaders, eager to impress, give artificially high 
              numbers when they report how many workers their unions organize 
              each year.</P>
            <P> Many labor experts say Mr. Sweeney has not been more successful 
              in persuading unions to increase their organizing efforts largely 
              because the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is a loose federation and its president 
              has little sway over member unions. The individual unions, and not 
              the federation, do the organizing, although the federation is seeking 
              to serve as a catalyst.</P>
            <P> In contrast to the organizing situation, Mr. Sweeney has had major 
              success in persuading unions to do more on the political front.</P>
            <P> "The American labor movement in terms of political operations 
              and political juice has showed its stuff," said Mr. Splain, the 
              organizing director. "The issue is, is there a way for the labor 
              movement to duplicate that type of success in organizing?"</P>
            <P> Andrew Stern, the service employees' president, said his union 
              was growing at the fastest rate partly because it spent so much 
              on organizing — about $100 million a year, or nearly half the union's 
              annual budget. He said it cost on average about $1,000 to organize 
              each worker. </P>
            <P> The hope among many union leaders is that if other unions with 
              more than a million members could match the service employees in 
              organizing 70,000 a year, the labor movement could begin to approach 
              Mr. Sweeney's goal of organizing 700,000 to a million new members 
              a year. </P>
            <P> "I see that some unions are organizing more aggressively," Mr. 
              Sweeney said. "We have to really try to build on that momentum."
