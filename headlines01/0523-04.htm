LONDON   - Environmentalists who suggest forests
can be used to absorb excess carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulating
in the Earth's atmosphere and contributing to global warming
may have to think again.
<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan and Duke
University in North Carolina have completed a seven-year study
which raises doubts about the ability of forests, so-called
carbon sinks, to soak up the excess CO2 being pumped into the
atmosphere from exhaust pipes and smoke stacks.
<p>Using forests to fight global warming, a plan backed by the
United States, was one of the disputed points at the heart of
the failed U.N. climate conference in The Hague   last year.
<p>The new research by the American scientists shows a
shortage of water and nutrients in the soil could limit how
trees respond to increases in CO2.
<p>``In terms of rising atmospheric CO2, I believe we need to
consider the fertility of the site when we are thinking about
how much carbon sequestration (absorption) we have now and how
much we can project in the future,'' David Ellsworth said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
<p>The finding does not change the situation very much for
current carbon sinks, he said, but it could have serious
implications on future predictions.
<p>``If we are trying to value future carbon sinks, this could
be incredibly important in the sense that future carbon sinks
may not be as large as we have anticipated based on
shorter-term studies and modeling activities,'' Ellsworth added.
<p>The assistant professor of plant physiological ecology and
colleagues examined the effects of elevated CO2 on forests with
limited nutrients over many years. They also exposed trees to
increased CO2 to simulate conditions predicted in 50 years
time.
<p>ROLE OF SOIL ALSO QUESTIONED
<p>Their results are reported in the current issue of science
journal Nature along with a study by other Duke scientists
which questions the role of soils as long-term carbon sinks.
<p>Until now the impact of soil nutrients has not been
considered as a factor in a tree's ability to absorb CO2, but
Ellsworth and his colleagues said it should be.
<p>``The debate over how much CO2 trees will absorb should
consider the limitations of soil fertility or other key
resources in low supply,'' he said.
<p>``It makes the playing ground a lot more complicated to
evaluate,'' Ellsworth added.
<p>The dispute between the European Union  and the United
States at the climate talks was mainly over carbon sinks. The
U.S. plan called for developed nations to be allowed to count
CO2 soaked up by forests against targets for cutting greenhouse
gas emissions.
<p>Opponents of the scheme argued that it could lead to a rise
in global emissions.
<p>``I don't think we can assume existing forests, with their
fertility limitations, will completely offset rising CO2
without soil amendments,'' said Ellsworth.
<p>``We will more likely find solutions in measures such as
burning less fossil fuel and planting more trees in
high-nutrient soils,'' he added.
<p>But the scientists cautioned that adding nutrients to the
soil may involve other negative effects on the environment.
