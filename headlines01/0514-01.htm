BRUSSELS  - Trade restrictions imposed by rich
countries are
costing the world's poorest "a staggering 2.5 billion US dollars a
year in
lost foreign exchange earnings", Oxfam says in a report released
Monday.   
<P>
The 27-page report, 'Rigged Trade and Not Much Aid: How Rich
Countries Help
to Keep the Least Developed Countries Poor', to be presented at
the NGO
Forum, in advance of the UN Conference on Least Developed
Countries, warns
that northern governments are guilty of offering "empty promises"
to the
poor when it comes to trade, aid and debt relief.   <P>
While Least Developed Countries (LDCs) face a complex array of
problems, the
report finds that their efforts to combat poverty have been
"systematically
undermined" by northern governments. 
<P>
Oxfam Senior Policy Advisor Kevin Watkins, who will present the
report,
says: "On trade, the industrialized countries have operated a
policy of
highway robbery masquerading as market access preferences". 
<P>
United States and Canada are identified as the "worst offenders",
with
Bangladesh losing seven dollars from trade restrictions for every
one dollar
it receives in U.S. aid and five times that for every dollar it
receives
from Canada.  
<P>
"Indeed, losses associated with U.S. trade barriers are roughly
equivalent
to total U.S. Aid to the LDCs," it says. 
<P>
Trade restrictions in Canada cost LDCs an estimated 1.6 billion
dollars, or
approximately five times aid flows to the poorest countries.
Similarly,
Japanese trade restrictions cost Bangladesh more than double the
amount
Tokyo provides in aid. <P>
At a time when aid to the developing world has fallen to its
lowest level
since the early 1970s, around 11 percent of exports from LDCs face
'tariff
peaks' in excess of 15 percent, which is three times the share of
imports
affected from other countries. <P>
"In areas where they have a capacity to export, LDCs face higher
tariffs
than other countries, including developed market economies," it
says.  <P>
Average tariffs in the European Union, the United States, Canada
and Japan -
the so-called Quad countries that account for over half the
world's trade -
are relatively low, at approximately five percent.  <P>
"However, the average obscures very high tariffs in sectors of
most
relevance to poor countries. Tariffs on some agricultural products
are more
than 300 percent in the EU and, in the case of groundnuts, over
100 percent
in the U.S.," it says. <P>
While the European Union's 'Everything but Arms' proposal for
providing
duty- and quota-free access to LDCs by 2009 represents a bold step
in the
right direction, intensive lobbying resulted in key agricultural
items -
rice, sugar and beef - being removed from the proposal.  <P>
In Europe, total duty-free access would increase exports from LDCs
by 185
million dollars, with sugar accounting for over 60 percent of the
gain,
according to Oxfam's research.  <P>
But the Everything but Arms initiative was watered down into
"Everything but
Farms", says Watkins. "The clear message from Brussels to the LDCs
was that
powerful industrial lobbies come first, and poverty second."  
<P>
While the doors to northern markets remain shut, many LDC have
been
liberalizing, often under International Monetary Fund and World
Bank
auspices, at breakneck speed, notes the pressure group.  
<P>
"The results have often been disastrous. In Haiti, the
liberalization of the
rice market and subsequent surge in subsidized US imports has
destroyed
thousands of livelihoods and undermined national food security,"
says the
report. 
<P>
In such labor intensive areas as textiles, footwear, and
agriculture,
production for export growth has the potential to generate more
equitable
patterns of economic growth, "creating employment and livelihood
opportunities for highly vulnerable populations", the report
notes. 
<P>
"There are potentially powerful inter-linkages between exports and
poverty
reduction in many LDCs, through a commitment to redistribution and
to
environmental sustainability would strengthen the benefits of
trade," it
says. 
<P>
"The problem is that trade policies in industrialized countries
are
carefully designed to prevent LDCs from taking advantage of export
opportunities."  
<P>
The Oxfam report also examines the rich world's record on aid and
debt
relief.  It concludes that the rich countries' performance on aid
has been
"derisory".  
<P>
In 1990, the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and
Development (OECD) pledged to increase aid and reach a target of
0.20
percent of their GNP to the LDCs in development assistance. Since
then, they
have cut around 3.5 billion dollars from their aid flows, which
are now at
their lowest level in per capita terms since the early 1970s. 
<P>
At the same time, annual spending in OECD countries on farm
subsidies - 1
billion dollars per day - is roughly equivalent to the GDP of all
the LDCs
combined. <P>
While many LDCs are eligible for debt relief under the Heavily
Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative, the report says that many will emerge
in an
unsustainable debt position.  <P>
"Preliminary analysis by Oxfam suggests that at least 13 LDCs -
including
Zambia, Niger and Senegal - will emerge from the HIPC Initiative
spending
more than 10 percent of government revenue on debt," it says. 
<P>
The Oxfam report is calling for: immediate duty free and quota
free access
for LDCs in industrialized country markets; reform of the EU's
'Everything
but Arms' proposal to include immediate liberalization of LDC
access for
sugar and rice markets; an end to agricultural import
liberalization under
IMF and World Bank programs; a timetable for OECD donors to
reach the 0.20
percent of GNP aid target; and deeper levels of debt relief.
