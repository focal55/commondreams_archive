GENEVA, Dec. 8 — The executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund says that the organization is striving to provide the basics of food and water to ensure the survival of an estimated 1.5 million children in Afghanistan who are at the greatest risk.
<P> "The basics are the primary issue," said Carol Bellamy, Unicef's executive director, who stopped in Geneva on Friday on her way from a trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan to assess the needs of the estimated 10 million children in the country. The neediest are 1.5 million children under 5 years old, of which 150,000 are considered seriously malnourished, she said.</p>
<P>Ms. Bellamy said their needs included food, water, winter clothes, blankets and heated tents in a region that had been hit hard by conflict, drought, disease and displacement. "With winter arriving in Afghanistan at the same time as a new set of political circumstances come into view, this is a crucial time," she said in an interview.</p>
<P> "As we plan for the reconstruction of the country's education system, health care network and other basic services for children, we cannot forget the immediate needs that must be met over the next difficult months."</p>
<P> Poverty and malnutrition among children has been made worse by the displacement inside the country, Ms. Bellamy said. "This movement to the borders has increased the risk of exposure, and the greater potential of encountering land mines," she said. Afghanistan is one of the world's most heavily mined countries.</p>
<P> Unicef is moving ahead with its immunization programs, having completed a drive to protect children against polio, which is still found in Afghanistan. A campaign to vaccinate against measles started last week in camps of internally displaced people in the north of the country. This is crucial, Ms. Bellamy said, because preventable diseases kill one in four Afghan children before age 5.</p>
<P>Eventually, Unicef, which has operated in Afghanistan since 1949, will focus on the country's shattered education system, Ms. Bellamy said. The last 20 years of turmoil and conflict have left only 25 percent of the men and 5 percent of women literate.</p>
<P>The agency has sponsored some home-based schools, an alternative for girls who were not permitted to attend school under the Taliban. Ms. Bellamy said that she visited a school in Kabul last week, and found that the number of children attending such schools had skyrocketed, and that they now included boys, too.</p>
<P> "Though the school year starts at the end of March, parents are so eager to send their kids to school, to give them a safe place to spend a few hours a day, that they send them to these schools," she said. </p>
<P>She said she would be seeking support to subsidize the salaries of teachers returning to public schools.</p>
