Ever hear someone speak Udihe, Eyak or Arikapu?<P>
   Odds are you never will. Among the world's 6,800 languages, half to 90
percent could be extinct by the end of the century.
<P>

Half of all languages are spoken by fewer than 2,500 people each, according
to the Worldwatch Institute, a private organization that monitors trends.
<P>
   Languages need at least 100,000 speakers to pass from generation to
generation, says UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.<P>
   War, genocide, fatal natural disasters, the adoption of more dominant
languages--such as Chinese and Russian--and government bans on language also
contribute to their demise.
<P>
   "In some ways it's similar to what threatens species," said Payal Sampat, a
Worldwatch researcher who wrote about the topic for the institute's <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/mag/2001/01-3.html" target="new">May-June
magazine</a>.
<P>
   The outlook for Udihe, Eyak and Arikapu--spoken in Siberia, Alaska and the
Amazon jungle, respectively--is particularly bleak.<P>
   About 100 people speak Udihe, six speak Arikapu, and Eyak is down to one.
Linguists say Marie Smith, 83, from Anchorage, is the last speaker of Eyak, in
which 'awa'ahdah means "thank you."<P>
   "It's horrible to be alone," said Smith, who spoke Eyak growing up in
Prince William Sound. "I am the last person that talks in our language."<P>
   It's becoming a struggle, too, to find many who can say "thank you" in the
Navajo language of the American Indian tribe (ahehee), "hello" in the Maori
language of New Zealand (kia ora), or rattle off the proud Cornish saying: "Me
na vyn cows Sawsnak!" (I will not speak English!).<P>
<P>
<P>
   Document of people gone<P>
   The losses ripple beyond the affected communities. When a language dies,
linguists, anthropologists and others lose rich sources of material for their
work documenting a people's history, finding out what they knew and tracking
their movements from region to region.<P>
   And the world, linguistically speaking, becomes less diverse.<P>
   In January, a catastrophic earthquake in western India killed an estimated
30,000 speakers of Kutchi, leaving about 770,000.<P>
   Manx, from the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, disappeared in 1974 with the
death of its last speaker. In 1992, a Turkish farmer's passing marked the end
of Ubykh, a language from the Caucasus region that had the most consonants on
record, 81.<P>
   Eight countries account for more than half of all languages. They are, in
order, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Nigeria, India, Mexico, Cameroon,
Australia and Brazil.<P>
   That languages die isn't new; thousands are believed to have disappeared
already.<P>
   "The distinguishing thing is it's happening at such an alarming rate right
now," said Megan Crowhurst, chairwoman of the Linguistic Society of America's
endangered languages committee.<P>
   Linguists believe 3,400 to 6,120 languages could become extinct by 2100, a
statistic grimmer than the widely used estimate of about one language death
every two weeks.<P>
<P>
<P>
   Reviving tongues<P>
   While a few languages, including Chinese, Greek and Hebrew, are more than
2,000 years old, others are coming back from the dead, so to speak.<P>
   In 1983, Hawaiians created the 'Aha Punana Leo organization to reintroduce
their native language throughout the state, including in public schools. The
language nearly became extinct when the United States banned schools from
teaching students in Hawaiian after annexing the then-independent country in
1898.<P>
   'Aha Punana Leo, which means "language nest," opened Hawaiian-language
immersion preschools in 1984, followed by secondary schools that produced
their first graduates, taught entirely in Hawaiian, in 1999.<P>
   About 7,000 to 10,000 Hawaiians speak their native tongue, up from fewer
than 1,000 in 1983, said Luahiwa Namahoe, the organization's spokeswoman.<P>
   "We just want Hawaiian back where she belongs," Namahoe explained. "If you
can't speak it here, where will you speak it?"<P>
   Elsewhere, efforts are under way to revive Cornish, the language of
Cornwall, England, which is believed to have died around 1777, as well as
ancient Mayan languages in Mexico.<P>
   Hebrew evolved in the last century from a written language into Israel's
national tongue, spoken by 5 million people. Other initiatives aim to revive
Welsh, Navajo, New Zealand's Maori and several languages native to Botswana.<P>
   Governments can help by removing bans on languages, and children should be
encouraged to speak languages in addition to their native tongues, said
Worldwatch's Sampat, who is fluent in French and Spanish and grew up speaking
the Indian languages of Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and Kutchi.
