NEW DELHI -- India is demanding that the United
States act
swiftly against a 'jehadist' group that has claimed responsibility
for
Monday's suicide attacks in Srinagar city, which devastated the
Kashmir
state assembly building and left 39 people dead.
<P>
   ''There are credible links between Jaish-e-Mohammed (Army of
Mohammed
which claimed responsibility for the attack) and the Al-Qaida
group of
Osama bin Laden,'' said Omar Abdullah, India's junior minister for
external
affairs and son of Farooq Abdullah, elected chief minister of the
Indian-held part of disputed Kashmir.

</table></font>Omar Abdullah said India's intelligence agencies have documents
signed
by Bin Laden, suspected of ordering the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks
in New
York and Washington, and Maulana Masood Azhar, chief of the
Pakistan-based
Jaish-e-Mohammed. 
<P>
   Azhar, a Pakistani national, was released from prison in
Kashmir by
Indian authorities in exchange for an Indian Airlines plane with
150
passengers and crew on board, which was hijacked to Kandahar in
Afghanistan
in December 1999. 
<P>
   According to Omar Abdullah, the presence of 'jehadist' fighters
from as
many 16 Islamic countries in Kashmir was proof enough that
militant groups
operating in the state had links with the Al-Qaida which U.S.
President
George W Bush has vowed to dismantle. 
<P>
   On Monday, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh delivered a
letter from
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Bush saying there
was
''understandable anger'' in India at the suicide attack in
Srinagar. 
<P>
   According to police reports, three armed militants crashed
through
barricades set up in front of the state assembly complex in a car
laden
with explosives, which they set off using a remote device. They
then set a
part of the complex ablaze before being killed by security forces. 
<P>
   ''It (the attack) comes a day after (Pakistan President Pervez)
Musharraf announced that no  terrorist groups were operating from
Pakistan,'' Vajpayee complained in his letter, a copy of which was
made
available to newspersons here. 
<P>
   Vajpayee's statement may well reflect his right-wing Bharatiya
Janata
Party (BJP) government's keenness to forge closer relations with
the United
States. Moreover, his call  for U.S. action against Kashmiri
groups like
Jaish-e-Mohammed comes in the weeks after the Sep. 11 attacks,
when
Washington is trying to build a coalition against Bin Laden's
network and
to which New Delhi has given its full support. 
<P>
   During the Cold War years, Washington maintained close
relations with
Pakistan, which contests the possession of Kashmir and has fought
three
wars with India over it. 
<P>
   ''Incidents of this kind raise questions for our security which
as a
democratically elected leader of India, I have to address in our
supreme
national interest. Pakistan must understand there is a limit to
the
patience of the people of India,'' Vajpayee warned in the letter. 
<P>
   Pakistan's military ruler,  Pervez Musharraf, has said there is
a
distinction between ''freedom fighters seeking self-
determination'' in
Kashmir and terrorist organizations.
<P>
   Vajpayee was among the first world leaders who offered
unconditional
support
to U.S. forces now preparing to strike at Osama bin Laden's bases
in
Afghanistan, but he has so far received no assurance in return
that
Washington was prepared to take on 'jehadist' groups operating in
Kashmir. 
<P>
   Instead, the United States has looked to Pakistan, its long-
time ally
that served as
frontline state during the eighties when Washington financed a
hugely
successful covert action against Soviet troops stationed in
Afghanistan. 
<P>
   Separatist political groups in Kashmir, led by the All-Party
Hurriyet
Conference (APHC), have condemned this week's suicide attacks but
said they
would continue unless ''the issue of Kashmir was solved
permanently''. 
<P>
   ''This will lead to peace and stability not only in India and
Pakistan
but also in Jammu and Kashmir,'' said a statement released by the
APHC,
which represents a dozen different groups based in Srinagar. 
<P>
   ''Now that a thinking is developing world over to address the
root
causes of violence, India should also give up its hardline
attitude and try
to resolve the Kashmir issue,'' the APHC statement further said. 
<P>
   But India has shown no sign of relenting and last week ordered
a
nationwide crackdown on the Students Islamic Movement of India
(SIMI) on
the charge
that it had links with the Al-Qaida and with the fundamentalist
Taliban
rulers of Afghanistan. 
<P>
   India's home minister, Lal Krishna Advani, said a crackdown of
the SIMI and
the arrest of hundreds of its workers was in the offing well
before the Sep.
11 attacks. 
<P>
   Advani was confident that the U.S. led war on terrorism would
eventually
get to 'jehadist' camps located in Pakistan which, according to
him,
provide arms and training to militants in Kashmir. 
<P>
   ''Phase two will include operations against cross-border
terrorism in
Kashmir,'' Advani told reporters. 
<P>
   Pakistan has consistently denied arming or militarily
supporting the
militants, but says it provides only moral and diplomatic backing
for a
bloody insurgency which has claimed some 50,000 lives since it
first began
12 years ago. 
<P>
   ''Even if India does not play a large role, we would like to
see our
battle against terrorism getting fortified by the developments. We
will
lend moral, diplomatic and logistics support to the U.S.-led
coalition
against terrorism,'' Advani said.
