NEW YORK  - Half of all people infected with the
virus that causes AIDS are aged 15 to 24 years, victims of their
exclusion from prevention strategies and of cultural mores against
discussing sexual matters, according to report released Monday. 
<P>
In effect, many die because of embarrassment, according to the
report, "Youth and HIV/AIDS: Can We Avoid Catastrophe?", published
by the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins
University. <P>
The document recommends more targeted prevention strategies and
encouraging an atmosphere of open discussion in which young people
feel comfortable asking potentially embarrassing sex-related
questions. <P>
Researchers also assail the United States for stifling discourse
on abortion and sexually transmitted diseases, saying U.S. policy
has hindered access to resources and information in many countries -
with disastrous consequences in places like sub-Saharan Africa,
where an estimated 8 million young people - mostly women - are
infected with HIV. <P>
Underscoring the urgency of the situation, the researchers note
that although 15 to 24 year olds make up only one-fifth of the
world's population, they have accounted for half of the more than
60 million new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections over
the past two decades. <P>
Some 11.8 million young people are living with HIV/AIDS, compared
with 10.3 million at the end of last year, according to the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. <P>
Youth advocates long have said that AIDS prevention starts with
education in schools, in communities, and among families, peers,
and partners. Young people practice unsafe sex, they say, because
they have little information about safe sex practices and because
they feel intimidated about asking sex-related questions. <P>
"There's a misconception that the youth don't get involved and
would not like to work out their problems," said Jane Norman of
the Washington-based Youth Empowerment Initiative. <P>
"The underlying fact is that young people don't get a lot of
respect and so sometimes they do not act out in the healthiest
way," she said. "Sexuality is a natural and normal part of being a
human being. When we make young people feel guilty, it makes them
less likely to come forward and get information." <P>
Iain Guest of the Washington-based Advocacy Project, which paid
for a group of youth activists to travel to six African countries
last summer to lobby governments and meet other young activists,
said youth should be active in strategies to reduce HIV rates. 
<P>
"Young people, the material shows, are in fact extremely good at
networking and connecting with their peers," Guest said. "We need
to remember that they can be trusted, and their actions are not
dependent on some characteristic behavior but rather on the
social conditions present." 
<P>
The U.S. Policy of denying funding to foreign non-governmental
organizations deemed to perform, facilitate, or provide
information about abortions, has ''hamstrung reproductive health
services abroad that need all the support they can get,'' said
Norman. Even where the ''global gag rule'' does not silence
discourse, she added, it ''censors information by emphasizing the
failure rate of contraceptives.'' 
<P>
The report cites urbanization, more liberal attitudes toward
sexuality, and the breakdown of extended families as factors that
have increased vulnerability to high-risk behavior
<P>
In Bangladesh, surveys found that 96 percent of young women aged
15 to 19, and 88 percent of young men, did not know a single way
to protect themselves against HIV/AIDS. 
<P>
The report also notes that some adult men in parts of Africa
believe - incorrectly - that having sex with a virgin will cure
them of the disease, or that sleeping with young girls will
minimize their chances of contracting HIV. In consequence, women
in some regions contract the disease 10 years earlier than men. 
<P>
Besides young women, high-risk groups include young drug users,
homeless children, sex workers, and the poorest. The report says
prevention strategies targeted at these groups would have the same
impact in reducing AIDS as a national campaign, at 20 percent of
the cost. <P>
Unless immediate action is taken, it warns, life expectancy in
countries including Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, and
Zimbabwe will fall to around 30 years by 2010. <P>
"It may already be too late to avoid catastrophic numbers of AIDS
deaths,'' said Hopkins researcher Karungari Kiragu. 
<P>
The report urges political and financial institutions to support
youth programs in developing countries. It notes that although
95 percent of people living with AIDS reside in developing
countries, 95 percent of AIDS prevention money is spent in
industrial countries.
