SACRAMENTO -- When Sacramento Bee publisher and president Janis Besler Heaphy walked 
away from the podium at Arco Arena recently, drowned by boos and foot stomping,
<P>she showed that a country built on free speech and dissent continues to 
struggle with how to behave in wartime.
<P>Heaphy's winter 2001 commencement address for California State University 
at Sacramento questioned whether the government's response to Sept. 11 would 
erode civil liberties. But the crowd didn't want to hear it -- and their jeers 
silenced her.

</table>Some students and parents said Heaphy simply politicized their "special day,
" but fallout from the speech also is continued evidence of how dramatically 
public discourse has changed since Sept. 11. Attorney General John Ashcroft 
made the starkest comments to date when he warned that people raising the 
"phantoms of lost liberties" were aiding terrorists.
<P>"I would think that three months after Sept. 11 we would be getting to the 
point where we could be circumspect about the new reality," said Nancy Snow, a 
government propaganda expert and lecturer at the Annenberg School for 
Communication at the University of Southern California. "But there is a lot of 
fear that you will not been seen as a patriot. I would hope that this would 
not have a chilling effect."
<P>Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who calls Sacramento his adoptive 
hometown, branded Heaphy arrogant for her "mean-spirited diatribe against the 
Bush administration." The Drudge Report  featured three 
posts about the controversy. Local talk radio hosts and callers hammered the 
subject yesterday, and the Bee printed 11 of several dozen letters and e-mails 
it received.
<P>"Heaphy had an inappropriate political agenda," wrote reader Kelly Heikila 
of Colfax. "She took it upon herself to push her opinions and viewpoints on a 
large, captive audience."
<P>An unusually large crowd of 17,000 people listened to about eight minutes 
of Heaphy's speech at Arco Arena on Saturday. But many of them started booing 
and stamping their feet when she raised questions about the federal detention 
of more than 1,000 people since Sept. 11, racial profiling of Middle Eastern 
men and secret military tribunals.
<P>"No one argues the validity and need for both retaliation and security," 
Heaphy said, according to a copy of the speech. "But to what lengths are we 
willing to go to achieve them? Specifically, to what degree are we willing to 
compromise our civil liberties in the name of security?"
<P>Heaphy declined to comment other than to issue a one-paragraph statement 
saying she stands by her speech.
<P>University President Donald Gerth said that a small group of people in the 
balcony had created the initial commotion but that others apologized to Heaphy.
<P>Gerth called the hecklers rude and said Heaphy's speech was "not only 
thoughtful but exceedingly responsible in today's world."
<P>But unlike Gerth, who says he likes substance in commencement speeches, 
many students questioned why she would criticize the government at a ceremony 
usually devoted to a speech with the theme, "The world is your oyster."
<P>"As for the speech itself, I think the ideas expressed were totally right 
on," said Eric Guerra, 23, an engineering student and executive vice president 
of the Associated Students. "As far as the appropriateness at a graduation 
ceremony, it's a little iffy."
<P>Bee political columnist Daniel Weintraub said he had received dozens of e-
mails from people who attended the speech, and many of them complained about 
the appropriateness of the subject at a graduation. But he disagreed.
<P>"It wasn't political. It wasn't partisan. She's not running for office or 
promoting herself," Weintraub said. "She was talking about an issue that, 
other than the war itself, is the most important issue in the country today. 
What better topic to discuss at a graduation ceremony?"
