WASHINGTON — Bush administration officials want to ease regulatory requirements on nursing homes, reducing the frequency of inspections and lessening or eliminating some penalties, according to government documents.

As part of a "nursing home quality initiative" to be unveiled in the next few weeks by President Bush, the government would provide consumers better access to information that could be used in selecting homes.
<P> But confidential government documents show that, at the same time, federal officials want to move away from what they view as an adversarial approach to enforcement toward a more collaborative one, in which regulators would work with nursing homes to improve care.</P>
<P> In measuring quality, the government would rely in part on data reported by the industry, which has lobbied for relief from regulations it considers onerous.</P>
<P> Thomas A. Scully, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, said the changes would make the inspection process "more effective and less burdensome." He said he was committed to protecting nursing home residents, whom he called "one of the nation's most vulnerable populations."</P>
<P> But consumer groups, members of Congress and unions that represent nursing home workers expressed concern about the initiative after hearing about it this week. This "sounds like the nursing home industry's deregulation dream come true," the Service Employees International Union said in an e-mail message circulated on Capitol Hill.</P>
<P> Administration officials said their purpose was not to roll back but to refocus federal regulation of nursing homes. Some of the changes could be made unilaterally by the administration; others would need action by Congress. But such efforts are fraught with political risk. </P>
<P> President Ronald Reagan tried to ease federal regulation of nursing homes in 1982. Congress ordered a study by the National Academy of Sciences, which found that many patients received "shockingly inadequate" care. Congress then set stringent standards in a 1987 law. In 1995, the Republican Congress tried to relax regulations, letting states set their own standards, but it was forced to back down after a huge outcry.</P>
<P> Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, which has authority over Medicaid and Medicare, said it was risky to reduce the frequency of nursing home inspections.</P>
<P> "The quality of care can change quickly, even for nursing homes that have had good records for extended periods of time," said Mr. Grassley, who was chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging from 1997 to 2000. </P>
<P> "Today's good nursing home might be tomorrow's poor performing facility" if there is a change in ownership, a new administrator, a new director of nursing or an influx of patients with more severe illnesses, Mr. Grassley said.</P>
<P> Some nursing homes go in and out of compliance so often that regulators refer to them as "roller-coaster" or "yo-yo" homes.</P>
<P> Joyce Winslow, a spokeswoman for the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid, said today that Mr. Scully was "very gung-ho on reviewing good nursing homes less often, and bad ones more often." Eventually, according to a document drafted by the agency, "good-performing providers will be subjected to less frequent or intense on-site surveys."</P>
<P> The federal government regulates 17,000 nursing homes that care for 1.6 million people who are elderly or disabled. The homes must comply with standards in return for the federal money they receive through Medicaid and Medicare — $39 billion a year. About 25 percent of nursing homes are owned by large national chains, small regional chains control a similar percentage, and the rest are independently owned.</P>
<P> Under current law, nursing homes that participate in Medicaid or Medicare must be inspected once a year on the average, with no more than 15 months between inspections.</P>
<P> The documents, obtained from federal officials who work on health- care issues, show that at one point this summer, the plan would have increased the average time between inspections to three years. More recently, the government has been considering a two-year interval.</P>
<P> The changes contemplated by the administration would not necessarily save money. Indeed, the government could incur a small cost in developing new measures of the quality of care.</P>
<P> The Bush administration says it wants to modify the enforcement process to "rescind some sanctions that are inflexible and often considered too harsh." Nursing homes object to a policy under which penalties are automatically imposed if, in two consecutive visits, inspectors find deficiencies that cause harm or immediate jeopardy to patients. </P>
<P> When that policy was announced by the Clinton administration in December 1999, the nursing home industry said it was too punitive and did not give homes enough opportunity to correct violations.</P>
<P> Under existing law, the government must stop payments to nursing homes that fail to comply with federal health and safety standards in six months after an inspection.</P>
<P> Government documents say the Bush administration would like Congress to change this requirement, so nursing homes would not be kicked out of Medicaid and Medicare if they made substantial improvements and if the uncorrected violations did not cause harm to patients.</P>
<P> Mark B. McClellan, a White House aide, said: "We are trying to strengthen and improve the quality of care. That's a high priority for the president."</P>
<P> One of the administration's goals, according to the government documents, is to devise new measures of the quality of care, using data reported by nursing homes. These "quality indicators" on issues like the number of patients with severe bed sores, dehydration or significant weight loss, would be made available to the public.</P>
<P> As government officials gain confidence in the accuracy of such data, they could reduce "the frequency and intensity" of inspections at homes with a history of good performance, the documents say.</P>
<P> Senator Grassley said that, while he did not have all the details of the proposal, he was concerned that it relied too heavily on data reported by nursing homes. "Self-reported data won't always be objective or reliable," Mr. Grassley said.</P>
<P> Nursing homes already collect large amounts of clinical information on each patient. The information, known as the minimum data set, is used to assess patients' needs and to help the government compute the proper reimbursement.</P>
<P> The Department of Health and Human Services said last year that most nursing homes did not have enough employees to provide proper care or to keep pace with the growing demand for care. Experts retained by the Clinton administration recommended new rules that would require thousands of homes to hire more nurses and nurse aides.</P>
<P> Alan E. DeFend, vice president of the American Health Care Association, a trade group for the industry, said today that nursing homes needed more federal money to recruit and train employees.</P>
<P> In a report last year, the government said that nursing homes with a low ratio of employees to patients were "significantly more likely to have quality-of-care problems." But Bush administration officials said they did not want to set staffing ratios for the industry.</P>
<P> Under current law, nursing homes with serious deficiencies are not allowed to conduct training programs for nurses' aides. Federal officials want to lift the ban. </P>
<P> "We expect the industry groups would be very supportive of a proposed change to the law, but the consumer groups would be very opposed," the Bush administration predicted in a memorandum.</P>
