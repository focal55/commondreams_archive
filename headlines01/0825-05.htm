The <a href="http://www.centerforculturalexchange.org/" target="_new">Center 
for Cultural Exchange</a>, known for sponsoring hundreds of multicultural 
performances, is renting its facilities in Portland to <a href="http://www.nike.com/" target="_new">Nike Inc</a>., a 
footwear and apparel company known for its exploitation of workers in 
sweatshops across the globe, for the corporation's annual shareholders' 
meeting on Sept. 17. 
        
<p> The center's decision to do business 
with the Oregon-based Nike has sparked threats of demonstrations from 
several groups concerned about the company's record of exploiting Third-World 
workers.</p>
<p> The center is a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to promoting cultural awareness by presenting performances 
of music and dance from a wide range of ethnic and refugee populations. 
It also rents its facilities in Longfellow Square to outside groups 
for meetings and events. </p>
<p> Beverly Dacey, the center's finance 
director, denied the organization had made a deal with Nike, insisting 
no contract had been signed. But Ken Kunin, the president of the center's 
board of directors, confirmed that co-director Phyllis O'Neill had committed 
the function hall for the stockholders' meeting. </p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly not a [center] 
sponsored event,&quot; Kunin said. &quot;It's a private rental of a space that 
the center maintains.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe after this meeting takes 
place, it would make sense for the center to take a look at its policies 
on private rentals,&quot; he added.</p>
<p> Both O'Neill and co-director Bau 
Graves were unavailable for comment. </p>
<p> According to Nike public relations 
representative Leslye Mundy, the company is holding the meeting in Maine 
because of its ownership of Yarmouth-based Cole Haan shoe company. </p>
<p>&quot;We're a global business with global 
shareholders,&quot; Mundy said. </p>
<p> Local labor and human rights activists 
are already planning to demonstrate outside the center during the meeting 
to protest Nike's factory conditions. </p>
<p>&quot;Nike is one of the biggest users 
of Third-World-country sweatshops,&quot; said Jack Bussell, an activist associated 
with Mainers Against Globalization. &quot;I'm sure we'll want to protest 
[the meeting]. The center should not be holding a function like this. 
They should be aware of what's going on in the world.&quot;</p>
<p> Michael Boyson, a member of the 
center's board, also holds stock in Nike, and plans to attend the shareholders' 
meeting. Boyson said he was not involved in the negotiation between 
the center and Nike.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have a problem with Nike 
meeting at the center,&quot; he said. &quot;I have confidence in [the center's] 
staff, and I have confidence in Nike. I know a great deal about the 
company, and as an individual citizen, I'm all for [the Nike meeting].</p>
<p> According to Nike's 2001 annual 
report, virtually all of the company's footwear is produced outside 
the United States, the majority in China (40 percent), with significant 
amounts in Indonesia (31 percent), Vietnam (13 percent) and Thailand 
(13 percent). In fiscal year 2001, about 5 percent of Nike apparel was 
manufactured in the U.S. and the remainder in 28 other countries, including 
Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Malaysia. </p>
<p>&quot;We believe that Nike would do 
well to operate in accordance with Maine values of common decency and 
basic fairness,&quot; said Bjorn Claesson, an organizer of the anti-sweatshop 
organization called the <a href="http://www.pica.ws/cc/index.html" target="_new">Maine Clean Clothes Campaign</a>, &quot;and hope that 
Nike's coming to Maine is a sign that Nike will indeed live up to its 
commitments to improve conditions for workers that make Nike products,&quot;</p>
<p> Mundy said the company had &quot;made 
a lot of progress over the past three years with improving working conditions 
internationally.&quot; In 1998, Nike CEO Philip Knight promised to bring 
&quot;a sea of change&quot; to the company culture.</p>
<p>&quot;We were heartened by his statements,&quot; 
Claesson said in written remarks. &quot;Unfortunately, a recent comprehensive 
examination of Nike labor practices by the human rights organization 
<a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/" target="_new">Global Exchange</a> during the three years since Mr. Knight made his promises, 
reveals that Nike still has far to go.&quot;</p>
<p> According to a May 2001 report 
from Global Exchange, &quot;The projects Knight announced have been of little 
benefit to Nike workers. Nike workers are still forced to work excessive 
hours in high pressure work environments, are not paid enough to meet 
the most basic needs of their children, and are subject to harassment, 
dismissal, and violent intimidation if they try to form unions or tell 
journalists about labor abuses in their factories.&quot;</p>
<p> That record has inflamed activists' 
passions about the Nike meeting and the center's decision to rent to 
the company.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be kind of insensitive 
of [the center],&quot; said Scott Miller, director of <a href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/" target="_new">Peace Action Maine</a>. 
&quot;[Nike] creates misery for all the people they employ with abject wages 
and health hazards. The center is there to bring information from different 
cultures to broaden people's minds, where Nike [creates] very low standards 
of living across the world. They fracture cultures, and they have no 
place in the center.&quot;</p>
<p> Ned McCann, treasurer of <a href="http://www.mainepage.com/maineafl-cio/" target="_new">Maine 
AFL-CIO</a>, is &quot;offended that Nike will be in Maine,&quot; and he promised the 
labor organization's members would turn up for the protest outside the 
meeting. &quot;Some of us will be there,&quot; he said, &quot;and we'll be making some 
noise.&quot; </p>
<p> David Ray, a former member of the 
center's board and the organization's current lawyer, defended the rental 
agreement, saying it was a simple business decision. &quot;Some of the things 
the center does aren't intended to follow its mission,&quot; Ray said. &quot;One 
part of the center is maintaining the rental facility, and the other 
is to promote our mission.&quot;
