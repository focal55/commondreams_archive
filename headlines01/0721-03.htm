GENOA, Italy - The image of Carlo Giuliani lying in a pool of blood, the first victim of an anti-globalization protest, has stirred a controversy worldwide whose effects are yet to be measured.
<p>"The people of Seattle have got their martyr," said Il Giornale, the conservative newspaper edited by Paolo Berlusconi, the brother of Italy's right-wing prime minister.</p>

</font>The demise of the 23-year-old Italian, shot dead during anti-G8 riots in Genoa, has triggered fresh questions about the future of international summits, with leaders wondering whether to scale back such gatherings in the light of the massive security and disruption caused each time the pow-wows take place
<p>It has also thrown a chill across the anti-globalization movement, whose members largely prefer to put their complaints about the running of the world economy peacefully.</p>
<p>But both in Genoa and at an EU summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, last month, the pacifists were overtaken by anarchists opting for violence to press home their political differences with world rulers.</p>
<p>In Italy, the death may have its own domestic repercussions.</p>
<p>At a new anti-G8 protest march of more than 100,000 people in Genoa, many wore black armbands and many had been to the site of the death the previous day to leave flowers.</p>
<p>When police fired tear gas into the air again Saturday, the protesters chanted "Assassins, assassins!"</p>
<p>Pictures of Giuliani's last moments as he joined a mob smashing a police jeep and then lying dead under a police vehicle appeared in every Italian paper.</p>
<p>Police said he was a member of a group of punks that hung around Genoa. He came from a comfortable background in a left-wing middle-class family, but was unemployed and had a criminal record for minor offenses.</p>
<p>"I've known him for years. He was an ordinary kid. Of course, he was no pacifist, but that's no reason to shoot him in the head," said Attilio Rattu, a young Italian come to mourn his friend.</p>
<p>The carabinieri trooper thought to have fired the fatal shots was charged with murder Saturday, Genoa's public prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Luigi Meloni said that three carabinieri officers had been inside a police Land Rover which had been attacked by demonstrators wielding "instruments designed to hurt" and that one of the officers was seriously injured.</p>
<p>One trooper shot Giuliani in the face, he said.</p>
<p>"An autopsy will be held this afternoon to establish the exact cause of death and to give the family time to see the body. Witnesses have already been heard," he said.</p>
<p>A second carabinieri officer is also under investigation but a decision on an indictment will only be made after a post-mortem.</p>
<p>An autopsy carried out Saturday showed that Giuliani had been killed by a single gunshot wound. The bullet entered his head through his left cheek bone and left by the top of his neck, coroners said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the vehicle drove twice over the protester's body.</p>
<p>The second carabiniere was at the wheel of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The death was the first of a member of the world-wide anti-capitalist movement since its began its campaign of mass demonstrations against international institutions in 1999 at the Seattle meeting of the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>It's effects were felt in Germany, where protesters attending the Bonn conference on the Kyoto climate change protocol held a minute's silence, and in Switzerland, where demonstrators attacked an Italian tourist office.</p>
