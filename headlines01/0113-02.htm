            AUSTIN -- Marvin Olasky won't be in Washington next Saturday when 
            George W. Bush becomes president, taking the oath of office on a Bible 
            used by his father at his inauguration and also used at the nation's 
            first presidential inauguration of George Washington in 1789. 
            <P>Mr. Olasky isn't one for big parties and hoopla. But the writings 
              of the little-known Texas professor -- ideas that would break down 
              the traditional barriers between church and state -- will be on 
              the lips of many members of the new Republican ascendancy, including 
              its leader.</P>
            <P>The phrase &#34;compassionate conservatism&#34; tripped off Mr. 
              Bush's lips hundreds of times during the campaign.</P>
            <P>It sounded, to most observers, like something aimed at appeasing 
              moderate voters.</P>
            <P>But to fundamentalist Christian conservatives, it signified the 
              beginning of a radical public-policy experiment, one that is neither 
              glib nor moderate.</P>
            <P>The phrase was coined by Mr. Olasky, a slight, tweedy man who teaches 
              journalism at the University of Texas and has become one of Mr. 
              Bush's most influential intellectual advisers.</P>
            <P>He did not hold an official position in Mr. Bush's Texas administration 
              and that won't change as the former governor moves to the White 
              House.</P>
            <P>But Mr. Bush is preparing to make the professor's ideas a central 
              part of his government.</P>
            <P>In short, compassionate conservatism is a taxpayer-funded mission 
              to allow religious groups to provide most government social programs, 
              allowing them to operate homeless shelters, drug-treatment programs, 
              pregnancy-counselling services, prisons and unemployment offices 
              -- even if their mission is to convert their clients to religious 
              faith.</P>
            <P>To opponents who charge that this will set social programs back 
              a century, Mr. Olasky pleads guilty. This, he says, is exactly the 
              point.</P>
            <P>&#34;Historically, what we've found is the most useful kind of 
              poverty-fighting is spiritual,&#34; he said in an interview yesterday 
              at his home in the hilly suburbs of Austin. &#34;If I've been any 
              use in this process, it's [been by] bringing up some history and 
              showing how in this country we knew how to fight poverty, through 
              compassion that's challenging and personal and spiritual. And we 
              forgot that in the 20th century.&#34;</P>
            <P>Mr. Olasky, like Mr. Bush, is a fundamentalist born-again Christian. 
              The two have shared ideas since 1993, shortly before Mr. Bush was 
              elected governor. Their last meeting was just last month.</P>
            <P>Mr. Olasky's book, <I>Compassionate Conservatism, </I>published 
              last year, contains a laudatory introduction by the President-elect 
              and a reprint of a campaign speech in which Mr. Bush promised to 
              bring religious groups into the government fold.</P>
            <P>&#34;In every instance where my administration sees a responsibility 
              to help people, we will look first to faith-based organizations, 
              charities and community groups that have shown their ability to 
              save and change lives,&#34; Mr. Bush said, adding that the greatest 
              hope for the poor is not found in &#34;reform&#34; but in &#34;redemption.&#34; 
              In other words, religious belief.</P>
            <P>In recent days, Mr. Bush has created an Office of Faith-Based Programs. 
              It likely will be headed by Stephen Goldsmith, a former Republican 
              mayor of Indianapolis who allowed religious groups to offer many 
              of the city's social services. Mr. Bush has promised to expand the 
              scope of a 1996 law that allows people to redirect tax dollars to 
              private charities and religious groups. He has stressed that those 
              programs will also be offered by non-religious organizations.</P>
            <P>Mr. Olasky and his followers believe that poverty is not caused 
              by a lack of money, but by a lack of moral values on behalf of the 
              poor. As such, they see welfare as a poor alternative to religion.</P>
            <P>&#34;When I've gone around and talked to guys who've been homeless 
              for a long time or are alcoholics or addicts, when they do come 
              out of it, nine times out of 10, in my experience, it's a religious 
              transformation,&#34; Mr. Olasky said. &#34;When you're thinking 
              about helping the people in the greatest need, then it doesn't happen 
              except through a type of religious transformation.&#34;</P>
            <P>Many Republicans and religious conservatives believe that the Office 
              of Faith-Based Programs should be just the beginning. Jesse Helms, 
              the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, 
              said this week that foreign aid should be placed under the care 
              of religious organizations.</P>
            <P>All of this has raised the ire of freedom-of-expression groups 
              and constitutional scholars, who point out that the United States 
              was founded on the notion of a resolutely secular state. It is one 
              of the few major Western nations, along with France, whose Constitution 
              does not have a theological basis (mention of God in the Pledge 
              of Allegiance and the In God We Trust slogan on currency were added 
              just decades ago to differentiate the United States from Communist 
              countries.)</P>
            <P>&#34;This is on its face a kind of constitutional crisis. The merger 
              of church and state in the White House represents a terrible reversal 
              of the country's principles,&#34; said Barry Lynn, head of the Washington 
              advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</P>
            <P>The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, he notes, contains the 
              phrase &#34;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
              of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&#34; and 
              the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that governments 
              cannot direct funds to religious groups.</P>
            <P>But Mr. Olasky and his followers believe separation of church and 
              state is based on a misinterpretation of the Constitution. In his 
              books, he offers a rereading of U.S. history in which such luminaries 
              as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison are replaced by more spiritually 
              minded early Americans.</P>
            <P>&#34;The government was meant to be secular in the sense of not 
              preferring any religion. That's what the First Amendment was all 
              about,&#34; Mr. Olasky said yesterday. &#34;The founders would have 
              seen what we've done to the public square not as neutrality, but 
              as nakedness.&#34;</P>
            <P>Mr. Olasky has devoted his life to extremes. Raised in the Jewish 
              faith, his political views became increasingly radical and isolated 
              at university. He joined the Communist Party in the early 1970s, 
              when even members of the extreme left had rejected Moscow-style 
              leadership. He toured the Soviet Union and became an agitator on 
              the University of Michigan campus, until a second, equally dramatic 
              transformation occurred, shortly after he married his second wife, 
              Susan Northway.</P>
            <P>&#34;We asked ourselves which denomination represented the extreme 
              opposite of the hard-left,&#34; Ms. Northway said in a 1999 interview. 
              &#34;Then we looked in the phone book and found the Conservative 
              Baptist Church. By the end of that summer of '76, we had come to 
              Christ.&#34;</P>
            <P>In 1985, Mr. Olasky founded a weekly newsmagazine, World, which 
              reviews events from a rigidly biblical perspective (he claims it 
              is now the fourth-largest newsmagazine in the country). He created 
              a new Presbyterian church suited to his views.</P>
            <P>A decade later, his book, <I>The Tragedy of American Compassion, 
              </I>which introduced the concept of compassionate conservatism, 
              got him noticed in Washington.</P>
            <P>When Newt Gingrich led the Republican takeover of the House of 
              Representatives in 1994, he sent a copy of the book to every congressman. 
              It was eagerly read by George W. Bush, who had converted to fundamentalist 
              Christianity in the 1980s in an effort to end his drinking problems.</P>
            <P>During his tenure as Texas governor, Mr. Bush became the first 
              state leader to allow proselytizing Christian organizations to offer 
              state-funded social programs, including a ministry-run prison program.</P>
            <P>Mr. Olasky and Mr. Bush appear to have met at an opportune moment, 
              when devoutly religious citizens -- almost half of all Americans 
              believe that the Bible is literally true -- felt profoundly alienated 
              from their government.</P>
            <P>Throughout his election campaign, Mr. Bush made outspoken appeals 
              to disenfranchised Christians. His Democratic opponent, Al Gore, 
              is also a fundamentalist Christian and made equally frequent mentions 
              of God and Jesus Christ on the stump, but Mr. Bush peppered his 
              speeches with phrases, such as &#34;personal redemption,&#34; that 
              carry special meaning for the religious right.</P>
            <P>A poll of 1,500 Americans conducted this week by Public Agenda, 
              a nonprofit research organization, found that 44 per cent think 
              government funding for social services offered by religious groups 
              is &#34;a good idea.&#34; About 30 per cent consider it &#34;a bad 
              idea,&#34; while 23 per cent would support it if the programs did 
              not carry religious messages.</P>
            <P>In other words, many Americans seem to agree with Mr. Olasky that 
              religious and secular groups should compete for the souls of the 
              American poor.</P>
            <P>&#34;The thing that's been debated for 2000 years is what is Caesar's 
              and what is God's,&#34; he said. &#34;You can't dissociate your 
              policymaking from religious views, but you can do what Bush does, 
              which is neither to encourage nor discourage religious groups, but 
              to judge by results.&#34;
