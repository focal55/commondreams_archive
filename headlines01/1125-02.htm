            The complaints are coming from all corners of the country and from 
            people in all types of industries — from an airplane mechanic in Texas 
            to a Wal-Mart<org idsrc="NYSE" value="WMT"/> greeter in Virginia. 
            <P> Since Sept. 11, Arab-American groups say, hundreds of people have 
              said they are experiencing discrimination in the workplace because 
              of their nationality or religion. </P>
            <P> Nearly 100 people have filed complaints with the Federal Equal 
              Employment Opportunity Commission, and others have decided to sue 
              over what they perceive as a backlash against people of Arab descent. 
              Their advocates say that the number of complaints to the commission 
              would be higher but that many Arabs and Arab-Americans are suspicious 
              of the federal government.</P>
            <P> Of the complaints that have been filed, Reginald Welch, a spokesman 
              for the commission, said: "These people say they were singled out 
              for mistreatment, they were harassed, or they were fired. Something 
              happened on the job that they believe would not have happened if 
              it were not for Sept. 11 and if they were not perceived to be of 
              Middle Eastern descent." </P>
            <P> But a look at a handful of complaints suggests the circumstances 
              may be murkier than that. Companies forcefully deny any discrimination. 
              Some said the crippled economy was the culprit, forcing them to 
              lay off many people, not only those of Middle Eastern descent. Others 
              said workers were fired because of behavior or performance problems.</P>
            <P> In at least a couple of cases, it appears that tensions arising 
              from the terrorist attacks might have led to an employee being fired, 
              but the employees and employers tell different stories. </P>
            <P> Fatmah Anabtawi of Island Park, N.Y., said she was fired from 
              the Island Park Laundromat because she is a Muslim. Ms. Anabtawi, 
              44, a Jordanian-born American citizen, said the owner of the self-service 
              laundromat told her on Sept. 14 that customers were scared of her.</P>
            <P> "He said, `They are scared you want to put a bomb in my store,' 
              " said Ms. Anabtawi, who worked part time at the laundry, washing, 
              drying and folding. </P>
            <P> The owner, John Weber, said that he fired Ms. Anabtawi because 
              of comments she made after the Sept. 11 attacks that he said caused 
              some customers to threaten to boycott the store. </P>
            <P> "She said to me, `America had it coming,' " Mr. Weber said. "I 
              said: `You know, Fatmah, not for nothing, but that comment offended 
              me. I don't want you saying anything to any of our customers.' That 
              week I got complaints from my customers, customers' husbands, local 
              merchants. She's in my store, my place of business and she's constantly 
              praising Saddam Hussein. She got fired because of her own actions." 
            </P>
            <P> In Ashburn, Va., Ossama Elkoshairi, 66, said discrimination had 
              cost him his job as a greeter at a Wal-Mart in Fairfax. Mr. Elkoshairi 
              said that he was teased and harassed by two employees who pointed 
              at him and said, " `He did it,' " and that one held up a picture 
              of Osama bin Laden.</P>
            <P> Mr. Elkoshairi, an Egyptian-born American citizen, said that wanting 
              to ensure the employees knew he condemned Mr. bin Laden, he replied 
              that if Mr. bin Laden was responsible, he himself would slaughter 
              him.</P>
            <P> Several days later, Mr. Elkoshairi said, he was called into the 
              manager's office and questioned for two hours by Wal-Mart officials 
              and an F.B.I. agent about his behavior and views on Afghanistan 
              and American bombing. He was then fired and, he said, told he was 
              not permitted to enter any Wal-Mart or Sam's Club stores. </P>
            <P> Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman, would not discuss the case, 
              but said the termination had been for "inappropriate conduct." </P>
            <P> In several other cases, companies said the firings of people of 
              Arab descent were unrelated to Sept. 11.</P>
            <P> Mamdouh Bayoumy, a 47-year-old Egyptian, has filed a complaint 
              with the commission against an Amarillo, Tex., aircraft service 
              company, where he had started work as a mechanic on Sept. 10. Mr. 
              Bayoumy said he was fired on Sept. 17 and given no explanation, 
              so he said he concluded that it was because of his nationality and 
              religion.</P>
            <P> Mike Manclark, president of the company, Leading Edge Aviation, 
              disputes that. </P>
            <P> "He was flat-out fired because he's a terrible mechanic," Mr. 
              Manclark said. "He was awful. A task that should take an hour, this 
              gentleman would take eight to do."</P>
            <P> Mr. Manclark made a point of saying that one of his managers has 
              a Middle Eastern background, and that Mr. Bayoumy was told why he 
              was fired. "I don't care where he's from," Mr. Manclark said. "I 
              don't care if he's purple if the guy can turn a wrench. He is using 
              this event as a tool. He's trying to get money out of it."</P>
            <P> Mr. Bayoumy has filed another complaint in a different case. He 
              said a San Antonio recruitment office promised him a job on a Boeing<org idsrc="NYSE" value="BA"/> 
              contract, but then turned him away, saying that Boeing was not comfortable 
              with his background. </P>
            <P> The recruitment concern, On Site Companies, referred calls to 
              Boeing. A Boeing spokesman, Paul Guse, would not comment on specific 
              cases, but said the company has strict hiring procedures to avoid 
              discrimination.</P>
            <P> Leaders of Arab-American groups say some complaints involve treatment 
              by co-workers or bosses. </P>
            <P> "People who used to joke with them didn't return hellos," said 
              Hodan Hassan, a civil rights coordinator for the Council on American- 
              Islamic Relations, an Islamic advocacy group. "Some say e-mails 
              would go unanswered. Co-workers have anti-Muslim and anti-Islam 
              conversations that were loud enough for them to hear, saying things 
              like all Muslims should be deported." </P>
            <P> The advocates say they believe there is more discrimination than 
              is being reported to the commission because of suspicion of the 
              federal government among some Arabs and Arab-Americans. Adele Rapport, 
              regional attorney for the commission in Detroit, said she believed 
              that was why only nine complaints had been filed through her office, 
              including that of a man who claimed a co- worker followed him everywhere, 
              even to the bathroom. </P>
            <P> Still, in several cases where employees complained of discriminatory 
              firing, the companies blame the economy. Sofy Moussa, an Egyptian- 
              American from Ashburn, Va., said she lost her job with the BDM Corporation., 
              which provides logistics and training to the military, because of 
              her ethnicity. </P>
            <P> Tom Fintel, the chief executive of BDM, a subsidiary of TRW, said 
              the contract Ms. Moussa was working on ended and virtually all the 
              employees in her section were laid off.</P>
            <P> Arsalaan Siddiqi, a 27-year-old Pakistani living in Herndon, Va., 
              said his employer, Veres Consulting, reneged on a promise to sponsor 
              him for a work visa, saying he was told "their patriotic duty demanded 
              they hire an American." </P>
            <P> John Burnham, a senior manager at Veres, which conducts surveys 
              for nonprofit associations, said the reason was economic. He said 
              companies can sponsor visa applicants only if they cannot find a 
              qualified American, and the softening economy made that claim unsupportable.</P>
            <P> "I wouldn't be surprised if he felt that way," Mr. Burnham said 
              of Mr. Siddiqi. "Arsalaan's a good guy. I felt bad that this happened 
              to him."</p>
