MARRAKESH, Morocco  - The first global
multilateral talks since the September 11 attacks ended in
success on Saturday with most of the world declaring it would
push ahead with a major anti-pollution pact, but the United
States will not be joining the party.

</table>Eight months after President Bush shocked many U.S. allies
by pulling out of the Kyoto global warming treaty, the rest of
the world finalized the legal work which should let them bring
it into force without the planet's biggest polluter.
<p>Bush's critics abroad saw that as evidence Washington,
already planning a strategic missile shield, was turning its
back on the concerns of the rest of the world.
<p>The Kyoto pact aims to reduce gas emissions from factories
and exhaust pipes that many scientists say are gathering in the
atmosphere trapping heat -- the so-called greenhouse effect.
<p>U.N. scientists predict the result could be an increase in
average temperatures by up to six degrees Celsius over the next
100 years, leading to rising sea levels, and an increase in
major floods and droughts.
<p>The events of September 11 led Bush to call on his allies
for a global coalition to fight terrorism. At the end of the
two-week climate talks in Marrakesh, many were calling for Bush
to now rejoin what the global fight against climate change.
<p>REASON TO REJOIN KYOTO
<p>``If ever there's a reason to join the United States should
do it now,'' said Dutch Environment Minister Jan Pronk, who
chaired the ill-fated Hague talks on climate change two years
ago when the United States was still a Kyoto participant.
<p>``After the events of September 11, if there is any reason
for the United States to call for international, global
approaches (it should also) join a global approach to the
existing global problem of climate change,'' he told reporters.
<p>``That would add to the credibility of any other approach
which is being sought by the United States seeking a global
answer.''
<p>The Marrakesh agreement sealed the legal text to govern how
the treaty works and, crucially, is meant to give enough legal
certainty for waverers like Russia and Japan to ratify it.
<p>It commits the world's industrialized countries to cut
their greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, by
an average of five percent of 1990 levels by 2012.
<p>As Russia and Japan indicated that the Marrakesh deal
should make their ratification possible, Kyoto could come into
force without the United States by late 2002.
<p>Canada said the fact that the world had agreed a workable
Kyoto rulebook showed its neighbor was wrong to opt out.
<p>``Canada thinks the American position on Kyoto is wrong. The
basic difference between us is we believe we can succeed in
achieving climate change goals within the Kyoto process, the
Americans believe you can't,'' Canadian Environment Minister
David Anderson said.
<p>``What we've done (by agreeing acceptable rules) is we have
shown our original belief that the Americans are wrong is, in
fact, accurate,'' he said.
<p>NEW NORTH AMERICAN APPROACH
<p>He added that he expected the U.S. to unveil a North
American approach to cutting greenhouse gases which Canada
would probably participate in alongside Kyoto.
<p>``We'll be almost certainly the only country in the world in
that position. So we are very concerned to make sure that the
American system is compatible with Kyoto.''
<p>The United States insists it will not return to Kyoto.
<p>U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula
Dobriansky said her country was looking for a global solution
to climate change, one that would be a ``tapestry'' of national
and regional measures, rather than the single worldwide system
provided by Kyoto.
<p>``Our overall goal is the same (as that of the rest of the
world),'' Dobriansky told reporters earlier in the week. ``We
have a common objective which is to address climate change and
to seek reductions of greenhouse gases.''
<p>Environmental campaigners said the United States would now
be forced to make good on that promise, inside or outside
Kyoto.
<p>``The agreement, and the fact that countries will move to
bring the protocol into force, will send strong support to
those in the United States who want to push for action on
climate change,'' Kate Hampton of Friends of the Earth   told
reporters.
<p>Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund said that as the
United States had a great input during the years since Kyoto in
helping draft the rules agreed in Marrakesh, some believe a
return should not be too painful.
<p>Many U.S. companies would be pressing for the right to
participate in any future emissions trading market that is
likely to develop under the Kyoto rules, she said.
<p>``This agreement includes many of the elements the U.S. has
been asking for over the years. It is an agreement that the
Bush administration should embrace and come in to.'' Morgan
said.
