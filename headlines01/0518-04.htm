WASHINGTON -- The General Services Administration has found that the White House vandalism flap earlier this year was a flop. 
<P>

   The agency concluded that departing members of the Clinton administration had not trashed the place during the presidential transition, as unidentified aides to President Bush and other critics had insisted. 
<P>

</table>Responding to a request from Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, who asked for an investigation, the GSA found that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. 
<P>

   "The condition of the real property was consistent with what we would expect to encounter when tenants vacate office space after an extended occupancy," according to a GSA statement. 
<P>

   No wholesale slashing of cords to computers, copiers and telephones, no evidence of lewd graffiti or pornographic images. GSA didn't bother to nail down reports of pranks, which were more puckish than destructive. 
<P>

    Among those pranks was the apparent removal, by aides to former President Bill Clinton, of  the "w" key from some computer keyboards and the placing of official-looking signs on doors, saying things like "Office of Strategery," after a popular "Saturday Night Live" spoof on Bush. 
<P>

   But the vandal scandal, tales of torn up offices and items stolen from the presidential jet, was the hottest story in town during the early days of the Bush administration until White House furniture and last-minute pardons pushed it off the front page. 
<P>

   "I think it was this calculated effort to plant a damaging story," said Alex S. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. "There was a sort of fertile ground for believing anything bad." 
<P>

   Typical was Tony Snow, a syndicated columnist and former presidential speech writer for President Bush's father, who wrote that the White House "was a wreck." He also said that Air Force One, after taking Clinton and some aides to New York following the inauguration, "looked as if it had been stripped by a skilled band of thieves -- or perhaps wrecked by a trailer park twister." 
<P>

   He went on to list all manner of missing items, including silverware, porcelain dishes with the presidential seal and even candy. 
<P>

   "It makes one feel grateful that the seats and carpets are bolted down," Snow fumed. 
<P>

   Except none of it happened. An official at Andrews Air Force Base, which maintains the presidential jets, told <i>The Kansas City Star</i> at the height of the controversy that nothing was missing. Bush himself acknowledged the same a few days later. 
<P>

   And now GSA has made it official. 
<P>

   "They told me that there were papers that were not organized lying on the floor and on desks; there were some scratches here and there, but the bottom line was they didn't see anything really in their view that was significant and that would appear to some as real extensive damage," said Bernard Unger, director for physical infrastructure for the General Accounting Office, which asked GSA to look into the allegations. 
<P>

   Mark Lindsay, who oversaw the transition as Clinton's assistant for management and administration, said he was pleased that the record has been set straight. 
<P>

   "Because of President Clinton, this was one of the smoothest transitions in the history of the presidency," he said. "This was nothing more than just lies." 
<P>

   As for the critics, Barr's office didn't return calls about the GSA findings. Snow was somewhat contrite. "I'm perfectly willing to admit my error on the aircraft," he said, but added that he still believed his sources who told him about damage at the White House.    
<P>

   "What often happens in Washington is gossip becomes news. That's not a good thing."
