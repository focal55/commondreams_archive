WASHINGTON  - The United States has told Russia
and its allies that it expects its development of a missile
defense will conflict with a Cold War-era treaty in months, not
years, documents obtained by Reuters showed.
<p>At the Pentagon, an official said on Wednesday that U.S.
defense officials would outline a missile defense plan on
Thursday that would propose breaking ground at a test site in
Alaska next month.
<p>Washington has told Russia that it plans to violate the
1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, according to the documents,
which were sent out as guidance to U.S. embassies a week ago.
<p>Moscow has viewed the treaty as the cornerstone of
strategic arms control although Russian leaders have said
recently it would consider amending the pact.
<p>The papers said the United States had told its allies and
Russia that it would seek capabilities prohibited under the
pact, including sea-based and other mobile methods -- such as
an airborne laser -- to shoot down long-range missiles in an
action often compared to chasing a bullet with a bullet.
<p>The documents were the most explicit public sign yet of
what a senior State Department official said Washington had
told Russia and its allies months ago -- that the Bush
administration expected to depart from ABM sooner rather than
later.
<p>The 24-page document said that Washington had told Russia
and its allies that ``while we do not know precisely when our
programs will come into conflict with the ABM treaty in the
future, the timing is likely to be measured in months, not
years.''
<p>``We will pursue all promising technologies and basing
modes, including those prohibited under the treaty,'' the papers
said.
<p>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher broadly
confirmed the authenticity of the documents, saying that
embassies had been sent points to use to support missile
defense.
<p>The documents said that a test system for fiscal year 2002,
which begins on Oct. 1, marked a first step in reviewing the
approach of the Clinton administration, whose policy was to
amend rather than scrap the 29-year-old treaty.
<p>REFLECT THE GOALS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION
<p>``The test program will be modified and built upon to
reflect the goals and guidance of the new administration,'' the
document said. The next test is due Saturday.
<p>Bush's proposed 2002 defense budget submitted to Congress
on June 27 seeks $8.3 billion for missile defense, nearly 50
percent more than in the current budget.
<p>Bush argues that with the end of the Cold War, U.S.-Russian
relations should no longer be based on ``Mutual Assured
Destruction,'' and that the key new danger is now from ``rogue
states'' like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
<p>Some European allies have expressed concern about the risk
that such a system could spur others to build more weapons,
essentially fueling an arms race.
<p>The documents said an interim ground-based system could be
deployed as soon as 2004 in Alaska, which would violate the ABM
treaty as it envisaged interceptor missiles shielding only two
sites -- a major city and the nuclear arsenal itself.
<p>Test assets could be adapted ``as soon as possible to
provide an interim capability against near-term threats.''
<p>In a clear reference to the threat from North Korea, which
according to CIA estimates could have tested missiles capable
of striking U.S. cities by 2005, the documents said an interim
system offered more protection against longer-range missiles
than it had now -- which was none.
<p>The Bush administration said Tuesday it was planning to
expand its test program to possible sites at Fort Greely and
Kodiak Island in Alaska as part of what Rear Admiral Craig
Quigley, a Defense Department spokesman, called a vast Pacific
''test bed'' to allow for more realistic intercept tests.
<p>Now the only integrated tests of interceptors designed to
shoot down long-range missiles are launched from a range in the
Kwajalein Atoll of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
<p>In the three flight tests so far, interceptors have
succeeded only once in smashing a dummy fired from Vandenberg
Air Force Base in California.
