NAIROBI -- Shelter for developed countries means a
house or apartment. In much of the developing world, it can mean a
cottage, or a hut. And for millions of the world's refugees and
internally displaced people adequate shelter means a tent. 
<P>
   Yet up to one billion people in the world still have none of
these, and live in makeshift structures at best. 
<P>
   "Today, our cities and towns are filled with street children
and people living in 'spontaneous settlements', sprawling slum
settlements without water sewage, garbage collection or
electricity," says United Nations Centre for Human Settlements
(Habitat) executive director Anne Kajimulo Tibaijuka. 
<P>
   Tibaijuka told the Habitat preparatory committee, which is
organising the 'Istanbul Plus 5' June conference, that rapid
urbanisation fuelled by globalisation is expected to continue
exerting pressure on cities and their governments to provide
workable solutions for problems of providing adequate shelter. 
<P>
   'Istanbul Plus 5' will take place in New York in June to
evaluate progress made so far by governments to meet the challenge
of providing shelter to their populations.  
<P>
   The meeting, which is being held at the Habitat headquarters
this week, is also expected to appraise the Habitat Agenda, a
blueprint, which governments signed in 1996 to provide "adequate
shelter for all". 
<P>
   The global urban population is expected to double in the next
generation from 2.5 to 5 billion as a result of rapid
globalisation, exerting further pressure on cities to provide
additional shelter. The issues of urban settlements have been
compounded further by critical economic, social and environmental
factors associated with globalisation. 
<P>
   To raise the profile of the urban problem, Habitat will
spearhead two major global campaigns to improve the implementation
of the Habitat agenda, a blue print signed by 171 governments in
1996 to provide adequate shelter to the world's homeless people. 
<P>
   The two campaigns on "security of tenure" and "good urban
governance" are expected to fit into the two Habitat themes of
"adequate shelter for all" and "sustainable development". 
<P>
   The good governance theme also would include good urban
management and all-inclusive democratic local governments. Nigeria
has been chosen as the venue for launching the Global campaign for
good governance (GUG) in the African region. 
<P>
   The security of tenure campaign calls on governments to put in
place policies that give people equal access to land and promote
security for residential tenure. 
<P>
   The campaign has been supported by the European Union (EU). "EU
is very much in favour of strengthened policies of
decentralisation," said EU representative Soren Haggroth, from
Sweden. "A major challenge is how to create a true democracy where
the citizens have a veritable opportunity to influence the
decision  making process regarding their local conditions and
possibilities." 
<P>
   In developing countries migration from the rural to urban
centres to seek employment is escalating poverty in cities. The
picture is, however, different in the EU and North America, where
majority of population is relatively well housed, and citizens
enjoy access to housing markets and the necessary financing, and
at the same time with a leading edge in housing-related
technology. 
<P>
   Also among the core issues to be discussed is the role of the
family in the habitat agenda. The Vatican's representative to
Habitat, Giovanni Tonucci, expressed concern that the family's
central role as "basic unit of society" within the Habitat Agenda
has not been reflected in the organisation's key indicators and
"no significant mention of the family is made in the secretariat's
documents". 
<P>
   The Habitat Agenda has committed to facilitate the family's
integration and preservation within its "adequate shelter for all"
goal.   
<P>
   "Clearly, any review of the implementation of the Habitat
agenda that does not include a concrete analysis of the
fulfillment of its commitments to the family is at odds with the
Agenda itself," Tonucci complained. 
<P>
   The Nairobi meeting follows the UN commission of Human
Settlements, which brought together ministers, NGOs and Mayors
from some 70 countries to discuss the future of Habitat. 
<P>
   The meeting also is expected to prepare a draft declaration on
"Cities and other Human settlements in the new Millennium".   
<P>
   In June, says Tibaijuka, the governments of the world will come
together to commit themselves to further improving conditions in
our cities and settlements."
