NAPLES, ITALY - Thousands of anti-globalisation protesters have clashed with riot police in the Italian city of Naples.
<P>
An estimated 20,000 demonstrators gathered to protest against a meeting of the Global Forum -  a conference of government and technology leaders being held in the city.

</table>Police fired teargas and rubber bullets at demonstrators after they broke through barricades in an attempt to reach conference delegates from 120 governments.
<P>

More than 100 people were injured in the violence, including one police commander who was taken to hospital with serious head wounds.
<P>

Paving stones and smoke bombs were thrown from the crowds and rubbish containers were set on fire.
<P>

<P>
The protest was organised by the <a href="http://www.noglobal.org/">No Global Network</a> and included hard-line left-wing groups, anarchists, environmentalists and local unemployed people from Naples.
<P>
Witnesses said the central square looked like a battlefield as ambulances ferried the injured out.

</table>Several people, including journalists and parliamentarians, accused the police of using "gratuitous violence", but the Naples police chief said his men were attacked and the response was fitting.
<P>
A journalist and photographer said they had been beaten up by the police, while protest organisers said a pregnant woman had been among those hurt. 

<P>
An Italian television crew was also attacked by the protesters.
<P>
Cars and offices were damaged in the protest and shop windows were smashed.
<P>
Many store owners had shut their businesses in anticipation of the violence.
<P>
Helicopters circled overhead monitoring the clashes and about 100 people are reported to have been arrested.
<P>
"The situation is under control, but we remain vigilant," police spokesman Nicola Izzo said.
<P>
The demonstrators gathered at the scene after arriving in Naples on trains from Milan and Palermo. 
<P><B>Digital divide</B>
<P>

A total of 6,000 police had been drafted into the city, and had sealed off the centre with barricades and riot vehicles in preparation for possible clashes.
<P>
The global forum, involving 800 delegates from governments and international organisations, has focused on how new technologies change the concept and practice of government. 
<P>
While the five-day forum has a section dedicated to the digital divide, and ways of ensuring electronic access to developing nations, the protestors say the Internet age is only exacerbating inequalities.
<P>
Tight security has been imposed at dozens of summits and high-level finance meetings throughout Europe and the United States since huge anti-globalisation riots wrecked a meeting
of the World Trade Organisation in Seattle in 1999.
