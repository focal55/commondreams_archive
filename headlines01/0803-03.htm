The Pentagon missile that hit a warhead during a defense shield test last month had a bit of  help - a beacon constantly transmitting the position of  the "enemy" rocket.
<p>The military has been forced into damage control after <I><a href="http://www.kingpublishing.com/publications/dw/" target="new">Defense Week</a></I> magazine revealed that the warhead was carrying a global positioning satellite beacon that made it easy to track.</p>
<p>In fact, all four of the dummy warheads used in tests so far carried beacons, and even with this head start the "hit-to-kill" interceptor missiles managed to bring down only two.</p>
<p>Last month's test was held up by the Bush Administration as proof that its $US100 billion missile defense plan could work.</p>
<p>But critics now say the missiles would have had little chance of pinpointing the warhead's path without the help of  the beacons.</p>
<p>Mr Phillip Coyle, who ran the missile shield program until last year, said the beacons had been "a big help" to the interceptor missiles, acting "like a pinger saying, 'Here I am'."</p>
<p>A Pentagon official, Rear-Admiral Craig Quigley, conceded the obvious - the system would not have the benefit of such helpful beacons in the case of a real nuclear attack.</p>
<p>"The beacon tells [the interceptor] roughly where in space to start looking," he  said. </p>
<p>    "We will get to the point where we develop real final systems. But you can't go any faster now."</p>
<p>Admiral Quigley said the tests should still be seen as successes because the missiles had used their on-board navigation systems to home in on and destroy the warheads in the final phases.</p>
<p><I>Defense Week</I> reported that the beacon helped the defense missiles compensate for  deficiencies in US radar tracking technology  on the ground.</p>
<p>In the July 14 test, an interceptor missile launched from the Marshall Islands destroyed a dummy warhead fired 7,700 kilometers away at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base.</p>
<p>News of the successful interception had been seen as a much needed fillip for the White House as it struggled to persuade doubting legislators that the hugely expensive "Son of Star Wars" defense shield could work.</p>
<p>"They hit a bullet with a bullet, and it does work," the Republican Leader in  the Senate, Senator Trent Lott, boasted.</p>
<p>The director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, Air Force Lieutenant General Ronald Kadish, told a congressional committee that the Pentagon had been spurred on by its success and wanted to increase the  pace of testing.</p>
<p>He said about 20 more tests were scheduled over the next five years, beginning in October. </p>
<p>     The revelations about the  beacons threatens to take much of the political gloss off the successful interception and will ensure close scrutiny of  future tests.</p>
<p>The original Reagan era "Star Wars" program ran into similar controversy when a target was found to have been secretly heated to help the interceptor rocket's sensors pick it up.</p>
