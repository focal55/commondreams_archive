<p>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (Reuters) - The world's largest
offshore oil rig sank on Tuesday despite desperate rescue
efforts and began spewing oil off the coast of Brazil five days
after powerful blasts ripped through the platform killing 10
people.
<p>Rough seas forced Brazil's state oil giant Petrobras  to
abandon salvage operations early on Tuesday.

</table></font>Less than an hour after divers had fled the scene, the
40-story structure tipped sideways and sank below the waterline
within 10 minutes.<p>Diesel oil bubbled to the surface creating an extensive but
very fine slick and Petrobras said all 395,000 gallons (1.5
million liters) of crude and diesel stored on and under the rig
are likely to spill into the ocean as pipelines rupture and
tanks explode.<p>``We lost the platform, it sank,'' said Petrobras president
Henri Philippe Reichstul, visibly worn-out after five tense
days of rescue work. ``Without a doubt, the sea conditions
accelerated the process.''<p>Television showed survivors working on the rescue boats
break down in tears as they watched their rig quietly slip into
the turquoise sea. The giant green helicopter pad was the last
part of the platform to disappear.<p>Three explosions ripped through the rig off the coast of
Rio de Janeiro state last week, killing 10 of the 175 workers
aboard. One worker remains in critical condition with burns on
98 percent of his body.<p>On Tuesday, 1,580 gallons (6,000 liters) of diesel stored
in tanks leaked out of the rig as it headed to the ocean floor
almost a mile (1.6 km) below.<p>``It is inevitable that almost all of the crude that is in
the pipelines and the diesel in the tanks will leak,'' said
Carlos Eduardo Bellot, a local Petrobras manager.<p>The company said it is applying chemicals to break up the
slicks and lining up absorption barriers. More barriers and
boats are standing by to contain bigger spills, though high
seas have made it difficult to use them.
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="3">``A Sad Day For Brazil''</font></b></font>
<p>Some 79,000 gallons (300,000 liters) of crude in underwater
pipelines and 316,000 gallons (1.2 million liters) of diesel
could burst into the sea due to water pressure. But Petrobras
reiterated that deep-ocean well heads were well sealed, thus
preventing a larger disaster.<p>The potential damage would just be a fraction of the
world's worst oil environmental disaster when the Exxon Valdez
supertanker dumped 11 million gallons (41.6 million liters) of
oil into the Alaskan seas in 1989.
<p>

Non-governmental environmentalists were also not overly
alarmed. ``It is not a biodiverse area, it is almost off the
continental shelf,'' said Garo Batmanian, secretary general of
World Wildlife Fund for Nature in Brazil. ``The current is also
not bringing it to the coast.''
<p>If the winds changed direction, however, oil could reach
the Rio coast and contaminate precious mangroves.
<p>``It's a sad day for Brazil,'' Energy and Mines Minister Jose
Jorge Vasconcelos said in a television interview. ``All
Brazilians are sad about what happened, about the human impact
and about the environmental losses.''
<p>Rio's vice-governor, who was with the families of Petrobras
workers when the news came out, declared two days of official
mourning. ``It was a moment of desperation for the wives,
mothers and children who were there,'' Benedita da Silva said.
<p>Engineers have determined it would be virtually impossible
to salvage the rig or the nine missing bodies if it sinks to
the ocean floor. It will also be difficult to determine the
cause of the blasts.
<p>``Since last Thursday I knew in my heart that that iron box
would be my husband's coffin,'' said Ivani Peixoto, a distraught
widow who has been waiting for her husband's body in Macae, the
headquarters for oil operations off Rio's coast.
<p>Oil union leaders have called for a work slowdown on
Thursday to protest poor working conditions and to remember the
accident. Including the 10 latest victims, 91 Petrobras workers
have died over the last three years in accidents.
<p>Petrobras is creating a commission to investigate the cause
of the accident and publish results in 30 days. An independent
expert will be on the board to ensure transparency.
The platform was in the Roncador oil field 78 miles off the
coast of Rio de Janeiro state in the Campos Basin, which
provides 80 percent of Brazil's total oil.
<p>The rig, which started operating last year, was pumping out
80,000 barrels per day of crude, or 5 percent of Brazil's
total, and was expected to be producing at full capacity of
180,000 bpd by 2004. It was the biggest offshore rig in the
world in terms of capacity.
<p>Reichstul said that Petrobras would still manage to boost
total output this year as it works to become self-sufficient in
oil by 2005, but that it would fall short of initial targets of
1.42 million bpd.
<p>The company said its fiscal 2001 earnings could be hurt by
as much as $450 million because of the rig's sinking.
<p>Petrobras shares closed down 2.3 percent at 49.90 reais
($23.80) after the company announced the rig had sunk. The P-36
rig cost $350 million and is insured for $500 million. The firm
should receive the insurance payment in the next six months.
