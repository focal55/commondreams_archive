WASHINGTON - Pressed for cash, <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights Watch</a> recently appealed to foundations and individuals for financial help. From some donors, organization officials said, came a blunt answer: ''We're not going to do anything that involves criticism of the US government.''

</table>It was a jarring development for the New York-based group, considered to be among the leading human rights watchdogs in the world. But it's a situation many civil-liberties, civil-rights, and human-rights groups are facing, as a frightened American public reconsiders the national security costs of individual freedoms.
<P>



<p>''This is the first time in a generation, probably the first time in two generations, that the American public has felt personally at risk,'' said Ken Roth, Human Rights Watch's executive director. ''That has suddenly changed, and there are many people whose instinct is for the government to do whatever it takes to protect them.''
<P>



<p>Groups like this are on the defensive, mindful that their voices may be lone - or unwelcome - at a time when the United States is waging a military war abroad and a terrorist dragnet at home.
<P>



<p><a href="http://www.pfaw.org" target="_new">People for the American Way</a>, a leading free speech organization, briefly stopped its direct mail appeals after Sept. 11, and is cutting costs in the face of lagging fund-raising. Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the <a href="http://www.aila.org" target="_new">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a>, has stopped doing talk-radio shows to alert the public to the plight of 185 individuals in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under suspicion of terrorist activities or knowledge.
<P>



<p>''All you do is get screamed at,'' Butterfield said.
<P>



<p>The events of Sept. 11 have forced the activists into an unanticipated and tough battle of their own. They are seeking to draw attention to civilian deaths and rights abuses in Afghanistan at a time when the American public is largely focused on the US military effort there.
<P>



<p>They are trying to provide due process to arrested and detained immigrants at a time when Congress and the public are demanding a reassessment of immigration policy, and a tightening of US borders. Rights groups are questioning the new FBI authority granted in the antiterrorism package recently signed into law, at a time when many - including the groups' most devoted allies on Capitol Hill - are calling for more powers for law enforcement to fight terrorists.
<P>



<p>''Obviously, it's in times like these that human-rights and civil-rights groups are the most challenged, because the values that we stand for and that we try to promote are under attack,'' said Elisa Massimino, Washington director of the <a href="http://www.lchr.org/" target="_new">Lawyers Committee for Human Rights</a>.
<P>



<p>Butterfield said: '' We're in a defensive posture. There's not a lot of tolerance right now in this country for dissent of any kind. We're going to have to craft our message differently and figure out how to reach them.''
<P>



<p>''Our work is more essential today than it was two months ago,'' said Kit Gage, director of the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation. ''Is it scarier? Yes. Are we more likely to get hate mail? Yes.''
<P>



<p>For immigration-control groups and law enforcement officials, the events of Sept. 11 underscored points they say they have been trying to communicate for years: borders are too porous, security too lax, and the reins on law enforcement too tight.
<P>



<p>But lulled by peace and prosperity, the American public was reluctant to limit immigration further, said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. ''You could say that's changed 180 degrees'' in the last seven weeks, he said.
<P>



<p>Sept. 11 ''was a spark that just ignited broad public concern that has been simmering for years,'' Stein said. ''People have long felt that the system's out of control, poorly regulated.''
<P>



<p>Attorney General John Ashcroft - whom civil-liberties and civil-rights groups targeted for defeat when he was nominated this year - got much of what he wanted in the antiterrorism package from Congress, drawing support from lawmakers in both parties.
<P>



<p>While some civil liberties lobbyists painted Ashcroft as a political bogeyman who would limit individual freedoms, the public and Congress have shifted their attention to another, bigger enemy in suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden.
<P>



<p>Civil and human rights, Roth lamented, are not foremost in Americans' minds. ''I've done a few TV shows where I've been the lone voice against torturing terrorists,'' Roth said. ''The spectrum of permissible conduct has shifted.''
<P>



<p>Nan Aron, head of the <a href="http://www.afj.org/" target="_new">Alliance for Justice</a>, said: ''Obviously, there's a sense that this administration has gone to great lengths to exploit the current sense of fear. To many of us, those fears are very real.'' While her group will continue to fight for civil rights and liberties, ''there's a need to appreciate people's sense of a lack of security,'' she said.
<P>



<p>Civil liberties leaders say they will soldier on, choosing their messages and the moments carefully. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> is keeping its focus on the use of torture, the forcible conscription of children as fighters for the Taliban, and civilian casualties in the war. ''It is important to the US that we not sacrifice our own values and principles during wartime,'' said Alex Arriaga, the organization's director of government relations.
<P>



<p>Human Rights Watch is counting civilian deaths in Afghanistan and is looking warily at political alliances they fear the United States may make with repressive regimes in the name of building an antiterrorist coalition.
<P>



<p>People For the American Way's executive director, Ralph Neas, has been lining up allies across the country to monitor the implementation of the antiterrorism package. The American Immigration Lawyers Association is trying to keep track of foreigners detained or arrested since Sept. 11.
<P>



<p>''My feeling is that it's in moments of crisis like this, in times of a national security threat, that our voice is the most unpopular and also the most important,'' Roth said. ''It's easy to promote human rights when nothing is at stake.''
