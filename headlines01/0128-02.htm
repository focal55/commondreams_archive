DAVOS, Switzerland - The Swiss sharply criticized Sunday what was described as a heavy-handed police crackdown on an anti-globalization demonstration Saturday in Davos, and similar protests in Zurich and other cities.
<p>"Police mobilization like in a dictatorship" ran the headline in the German-language weekly Sonntagsblick, the day after used water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a demonstration in Zurich, and imposed tight security to prevent protests in Davos.</p><p><TABLE Border=0 align=right hspace=5 Cellpadding=6 width="300">

A Sunday newspaper, Sonntagszeitung, wrote: "The spirit of Davos was suffocated in teargas" and the Swiss police "trampled on basic rights."
<p>For several commentators, Switzerland's image had suffered a blow, when police prevented even a European Parliament member, Roseline Vachetta, from traveling to Davos, an up-market ski resort hosting the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).</p><p>Among intellectuals, sociologist Jean Ziegler denounced in an open letter to the government "the shameful face of the Swiss," while the socialists took an even harder line.</p><p>"I wouldn't have believed that possible in Switzerland. The police have trampled on state law," Franco Cavalli, head of the Socialist Party in parliament, said in an interview in Sonntagsblick.</p><p>Warning there would be "political consequences" to pay in parliament, Cavalli said he wanted a parliamentary investigation of the police attitude launched.</p><p>He said he also will insist that the army would no longer be mobilized for public demonstrations, such as was done for the six-day WEF summit that opened here Thursday.</p><p>The police defended its actions, saying they used "moderate, exemplary intervention."</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

</font>Several government officials backed the police, saying that the measures were needed to protect the thousands of top political and business leaders at the summit.
<p>However, in a Sonntagsblick editorial, Frank Meyer blamed politicians: "The police would not have been able to play this game, if politicians respectful of democracy and their responsibilities had taken things in hand."</p><p>Meyer said "the police force coup had inflicted more damage on the global salon" of WEF founder Klaus Schwab than the anti-globalization protestors had dreamed of with their demonstrations.</p><p>He criticized the "provincialism" of the authorities and police in the eastern Swiss canton Grisons, who had halted train service to Davos Saturday.</p><p>The French-language newspaper Dimanche.ch said that the canton authorities, frustrated by too much quiet in their snowy Alps, "wanted to break out of it" and make themselves important.</p><p>"If it was damage to private party that one wanted to spare, I wonder: 3,000 men (police and army) during five days, that makes 10 million Swiss francs (six million euros, 5.5 million dollars), without counting additional expenses," wrote editorialist Gerard Delanoye.</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><TABLE Border=0 align=right hspace=5 Cellpadding=6 width="300">

</font>Financier George Soros, a frequent participant at the WEF summits in the Swiss ski resort, said in an interview with French newspaper Le Matin: "In becoming increasingly harsher, the security measures risk harming the spirit of Davos, and could dissuade participants from returning there, where the calm is a strength of the world forum."
<p>The Swiss socialist president, Moritz Leuenberger, who visited the WEF summit and a counter-forum, "Public Eye on Davos," took a moderate line.</p><p>In a text published in Sonntagszeitung, he wrote: "We must guarantee, as best we can, the WEF presence. Especially in the face of threats saying it should disappear."</p><p>As for any lawsuits alleging excessive use of force by authorities, he said, "independent courts" exist in Switzerland to deal with them.</p>
