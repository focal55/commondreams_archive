WASHINGTON &#151; Thousands more people than anticipated 
  face health and pollution threats from plutonium and other highly radioactive 
  elements that fouled vast amounts of uranium recycled by the U.S. nuclear weapons 
  program over the past 50 years. Recycled uranium was shipped worldwide from 
  1952 until 1999, when distribution was halted by revelations of its contamination.
<p>Now, new federal studies reviewed by USA TODAY show that 
  the program yielded 250,000 tons of tainted uranium &#151; roughly double the 
  estimates of two years ago. The material was handled at about 10 times the number 
  of sites revealed previously, reaching more than 100 federal plants, private 
  manufacturers and universities.</p>
<p>The studies suggest that thousands more workers than expected 
  might have unwittingly faced radiation risks beyond those associated with normal 
  uranium, increasing their odds of developing cancer and other ailments. That 
  places an unexpected burden on a soon-to-begin federal program to compensate 
  sick nuclear weapons workers.</p>
<p>Contaminants from the tainted uranium also raise the potential 
  for soil and groundwater pollution at some of the newly recognized processing 
  sites. That threatens to complicate cleanup plans.</p>
<p>Most recycled uranium went back into nuclear weapons production 
  or was used as fuel for power reactors. But thousands of tons also were used 
  in everything from academic research to the making of armor for Army battle 
  tanks.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the material contained only traces 
  of impurities &#151; too little, scientists say, to pose risks beyond those 
  posed by natural uranium, which is mildly radioactive and raises health hazards 
  if inhaled as dust. But some plants handled recycled uranium in ways that concentrated 
  its contaminants, significantly boosting its hazards.</p>
<p>"This stuff circulated much more widely than we'd thought," 
  says Robert Alvarez, an official at the Department of Energy when it launched 
  the new studies in 1999.</p>
<p>"The problem is, they really don't have reasonable estimates 
  of how much (contamination) was in a lot of this recycled uranium," adds Alvarez, 
  now a scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies. "It could range from very 
  tiny amounts to relatively high levels."</p>
<p>Federal researchers conclude in the new studies that contamination 
  generally was "extremely low." But that finding masks problems.</p>
<p>The uranium's contaminants apparently were concentrated 
  at a dozen or more previously unrecognized sites, raising pollution and worker 
  health threats. But it's unclear which batches of uranium were most dangerous 
  &#151; or where they went &#151; so not all high-risk sites are identifiable.</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., says, "The government has a responsibility 
  to follow up."</p>
<b>Military study finds fouled weapons safe</b>
<p>Since the 1980s, the Pentagon has relied 
  increasingly on the super-hard, super-dense qualities of depleted-uranium metal, 
  using it in tank shielding and armor-piercing munitions. And much of it is fouled 
  with traces of plutonium and other dangerous radioisotopes.
<p>The Army got word of the problem in August 1999, when the 
  Department of Energy told commanders that the depleted-uranium armor in the 
  latest Abrams tanks was made with recycled material contaminated during nuclear 
  weapons production. The Army quietly studied 60 samples of the tainted metal 
  before concluding early last year that "the presence of these trace radionuclides 
  in armor is safe."</p>
<p>This year, amid charges that U.S. and NATO troops were 
  sickened from exposure to depleted-uranium "tank-killer" munitions in the Persian 
  Gulf War and the Balkans, the Pentagon revealed publicly that the bullets were 
  made from contaminated metal. Although federal studies suggest that workers 
  who made the recycled uranium metal may face heath risks, military officials 
  insist that the contamination posed no threats in the finished military products.</p>
<p>Even so, at least two branches of the service have abandoned 
  use of the controversial munitions.</p>
<p>The Pentagon's troubles with the contamination have intensified 
  a heated global debate on the use of munitions and military hardware made with 
  depleted uranium, so-called because much of the uranium's natural radioactivity 
  was sapped when it was fed into nuclear reactors to make weapons fuel.</p>
<p>Studies to date support the contention that the levels 
  of contaminants in depleted-uranium metal are tiny and account for little, if 
  any, increase in the already low risks normally associated with the material. 
  Depleted uranium produces a roughly 1% increase in the "background" radiation 
  people normally absorb from sunlight and other natural sources.</p>
<p>But many veterans, environmentalists and public health 
  officials are unconvinced. Their skepticism is heightened by the Pentagon's 
  failure to announce the contamination of munitions and tank armor for more than 
  a year after it learned of the problem. Some experts recommend more study of 
  the mix of radioactive substances.</p>
<p>"You need to check to see if there's a cocktail that includes 
  some of these more radioactive (contaminants)," says Malcolm Grimston, a senior 
  fellow specializing in chemical and nuclear studies at the Royal Institute of 
  International Affairs in London. "You need to redo the calculations."</p>
<p>Munitions appear to be the most widely used military product 
  containing depleted uranium. U.S. forces fired more than 300 tons during the 
  Gulf War. Iraq claims the spent rounds littering its land caused broad environmental 
  damage and increased cancer rates. The same armor-piercing munitions were used 
  extensively by U.S. and NATO warplanes during the 1999 bombing of Kosovo. That 
  prompted ongoing risk studies by NATO and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The stakes are high, given depleted uranium's wide military 
  use. A draft document prepared by the Energy Department in 1999 and obtained 
  by USA TODAY shows that the fouled material was shipped to at least 50 U.S. 
  military installations, foreign and domestic, for various uses, ranging from 
  the tank armor and munitions to counterweights in military planes and ships.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials say substantial precautions are taken 
  in using depleted uranium, but there have been problems. In 1999, for example, 
  a maintenance bay at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia was contaminated with 
  mildly radioactive dust after a technician used a hammer to break counterweights 
  made of depleted uranium off a C-141 cargo plane. Urine and blood tests were 
  done on the technician and other workers, but no harm was reported.</p>
<p>Amid all the controversy, the Navy and Marines have decided 
  to abandon use of the depleted-uranium munitions. Both have switched to tungsten, 
  a non-radioactive, high-density metal.</p>
<p>"We're not considering depleted uranium anymore because 
  of the environmental problems associated with it, be them real or perceived," 
  says Col. Clayton Nans, head of the Marines' Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle 
  program and former chief of the service's firepower division. "We don't want 
  to be in a position of having someone say, 'You can't bring your armor piercing 
  rounds on the battlefield.' "</p>
