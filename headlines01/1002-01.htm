KUWAIT, Sept. 30 — The prosperous, pro-Western Arab states in the Persian Gulf are not countries where people take their protests into the street. So the general dismay about perceived American tolerance of violence against Palestinians, and the resulting lack of faith in American leadership, are scarcely visible.
<P> They are, however, audible in many conversations outside the entrenched and often autocratic royal families that have declared their solidarity with the American-led struggle against terrorism.</p>
<P> "It's amazing," said Saud Alanezi, a Kuwaiti businessman, confessed computer nerd and college lecturer who, like many people in this region, received his higher education in the United States. "No matter what the issue is these days, if the U.S. is on one side, everyone else wants to be on the other.</p>
<P> "Even here in Kuwait," he added, alluding to the American role in ridding Kuwait of its Iraqi invaders in 1991. "Just a while ago, you were our liberators." </p>
<P> The Palestinian cause has not always been appreciated in Kuwait. Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, appeared to some Kuwaitis to back Saddam Hussein's invasion in 1990, and most of the 400,000 Palestinians who lived here until February 1991 left under suspicion of collaborating.</p>
<P> There is widespread revulsion for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and for the methods of the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden. The feelings for Palestinians, however, are at least as strong.</p>
<P> "The story is not bin Laden," said Ghanim Alnajjar, director of Kuwait University's Center for Strategic and Future Studies. "The story is the injustice to the Palestinian people."</p>
<P> Public concern is strong enough that the gulf's rulers are taking note — whether out of fear for their power, or reluctance to wage an all-out struggle against fellow Muslims.</p>
<P> If Israeli killings of Palestinians continue, said Sheik Abdullah bin Zaid al-Nahayan, information minister of the United Arab Emirates, "most of us will certainly have to reconsider our role in the coalition."</p>
<P> At an emergency meeting in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, on Sept. 23, the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council — Saudi Arabia and its five small neighbors, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar — coupled their support for the coalition against terrorism with condemnation of what they called terror acts by Israel.</p>
<P> The oil wealth of the gulf states has produced standards of living that blunt both dissent and the tangible dissonance between traditional ways of life and the glassy futuristic skyscrapers of gulf cities.</p>
<P> Yet a Saturday night discussion at Kuwait University suggested surprisingly little concern with suspected terrorists who target modernization. The name of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel came up with far greater frequency than that of Mr. bin Laden. Questioners peppered four senior faculty members with comments casting doubt on the identification of Mr. bin Laden as the man responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and expressing fear of a "clash of civilizations" between the West and Islam.</p>
<P> "Who stood to profit from the attacks?" asked Ibrahim A. L. Hadban, a bearded political science professor. "Israel, of course," he said, answering his own question. "This is how we feel here." He was the only speaker in the hourlong session to draw applause.</p>
<P> Abdulnabi Mansour, head of the Bahrain Research and Study Center in Manama, said there was a general mood among residents that the United States "has directed its efforts at only one aspect — gangs of terrorists who are Muslim — while ignoring the state terrorism of Israel," adding, "There is a general conviction that the U.S. is unfair."</p>
<P> Saif Almaskari, a former under secretary for political affairs at the Gulf Cooperation Council, now runs a consultancy firm in Muscat, capital of his native Oman. There too, he said, people are not happy. "They wait in vain for the U.S. to say to Sharon, `Enough is enough.' "</p>
<P> All the gulf states are socially conservative, banning drinking and censoring media to eliminate both prurient and awkward political items. Yet all face indigenous Islamic movements that press for conservative reforms like the segregation of boys and girls in schools and colleges and imposition of harsh Shariah laws.</p>
<P> Also of concern to the ruling families are the large numbers of expatriate workers in their countries, often from poorer Muslim lands, who are thought to be more susceptible to radical interpretations of Islam. The United Arab Emirates is less than 20 percent native-born; Kuwait, 35 percent.</p>
<P> Two gulf countries have a sizable American military presence: Bahrain, the headquarters of the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet, and Kuwait, where up to 5,000 American troops, scores of fighter and support planes and a stockpile of equipment have been based since 1991.</p>
<P> The American troops and planes in Kuwait keep watch on Iraq and are not expected to play a role in any action in Afghanistan. The United States is eager, however, to use a new command and control center in Saudi Arabia to track aircraft.</p>
<P> As yet, the gulf governments seem able to keep emotions against the United States in check. "In the gulf," Mr. Alnajjar said with a smile, "governments will always be able to withstand. They will be totally with the U.S. regardless and will furnish whatever bases and resources the U.S. needs."</p>
<P> Not everyone is so sanguine. Abdul Khaleg Abdullah, a public policy professor at Emirates University in Dubai, reported what he called surprising tolerance for Mr. bin Laden. "A lot of people here view Osama bin Laden as a stand-in for the right cause but not using the right method," he said. "Remember, he appears to be standing up to America and to American policy in Palestine, and that's a popular stance here now."</p>
