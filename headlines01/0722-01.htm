President Bush is planning to escalate the US war against drugs from South America with new legislation that its critics say will allow him to deploy a 'private army' of former US servicemen across the region. 
<P>The disclosure comes amid mounting evidence that the controversial $1.3 billion Plan Colombia, a military support program initiated by the Clinton administration to sever the supply of Colombian cocaine, has had a negligible impact on supplies to US cities.  
<P>Experts say coca production has been switched to neighboring Bolivia, Venezuela and Peru.  
<P>The claim that Bush is seeking permission to deploy his own private army - unanswerable to congressional oversight - comes as Congress prepares to vote on proposals to inject cash into Plan Colombia by lifting a cap on the number of privatized military personnel allowed to be deployed there.  
<P>The cap, which was introduced following fears that the US could be dragged into a new Vietnam war, limited the total to 500, in a purely training role.  
<P>Congress also insisted that no more than 300 non-military personnel, largely working for private companies such as Dyncorp as coca- spraying pilots, could be in Colombia at any one time.  
<P>However, a new $676 million program - the Andean Counterdrug Initiative - would allow the Bush administration to deploy as many former servicemen as it wanted.  
<P>Questions about American counter-narcotics efforts in   the Andean region have risen sharply since April, when Peruvian jets shot down a US missionary aircraft over the Amazon river, believing it was laden with drugs. The Peruvian fighter was guided in for the attack by a radar plane operated by a CIA contractor.  
<P>Bush's personal involvement in lifting the cap was made clear by an official who told the  Miami Herald on Friday that 'the President requested this'.  
<P>There are 171 American civilian contractors in Colombia now, involved in activities   ranging from aerial fumigation and military training to administering judicial reform programs and helping internal refugees.  
<P>Concern has also been raised by a provision in the Andean Counterdrug Initiative legislation exempting State Department contractors from a section of the Foreign Assistance Act that specifically bans them from buying weapons and ammunition with federal funds.  
<P>The new legislation would allow the companies to purchase weapons and ammunition for use in the Andean region for 'defensive purposes', a definition, say critics, open to widespread abuse.  
<P>Underlying the concern over the escalation of Plan Colombia is a suspicion that the entire nature of the war on drugs there is threatening to take a dangerous turn in favor of overt military assistance for the Colombian military against left-wing guerrilla groups who, some US analysts claim, benefit most from cocaine production.  
<P>That suspicion has been fueled by a report commissioned by the US Air Force from the Rand Corporation think-tank, which says 'drugs and insurgency are intertwined in complicated and changing ways, but the former cannot be addressed without the latter'. 
<P>It concludes that efforts to reduce the drug supply in Colombia have been ineffective because America has focused more on 'counter-narcotics' than 'counter-insurgency' aid.  
<P>'We are worried that this new legislation would give the President sole control over a private army in the Andean region without any accountability to Congress,' Nadeam Elshami, a staffer with Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, told The Observer last week. 
<P>Schakowsky has tabled an amendment seeking to keep the cap on civilian military contractors in the new legislation.  
<P>'It's a backdoor way of escalating our involvement in the Andean region and providing additional money to private military contractors who have not been effective.'
