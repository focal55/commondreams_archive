BOGOTA  - Around 5,000 peasant farmers in Colombia
who returned to their land after being displaced by the decades-
old civil war are asking the government for protection from the
continuing harassment by right-wing paramilitaries and leftist
rebels. 
<P>
   The so-called peace communities set up in the western
department of Chocó, on the border with Panama, are urging
authorities to help them avoid having to once again flee their
communities, as they did back in 1997. <P>
   Since early this year, the leftist Armed Revolutionary Forces
of Colombia (FARC), the main guerrilla group, has been attempting
to move into the area where the peace communities are located. 
<P>
   In the meantime, the paramilitary umbrella, the United Self-
Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), is trying to maintain control
over the Atrato River, along which the peace communities were set
up, in order to keep the insurgents from using the river as a
supply route. 
<P>
   The rules governing the peace communities, which emerged out of
an agreement with the government, prohibit members from
participating in the war in any way, and from giving information
or supplies to any of the armed factions, including the army.
However, neither the FARC nor the AUC have respected their
neutrality. <P>
   The irregular armed groups ``kill members of our communities''
and do not allow them to move around freely, a leader of one of
the peace communities, who came to Bogota to knock on the doors of
the government, told IPS. He also complained that the residents
were subjected to thorough searches at army checkpoints. <P>
   The delegate asked not to be identified, because that could
cost him his life. ``Our situation is very difficult: we are
caught between a rock and a hard place. You live in a state of
nerves day and night, because you could be killed at any time.'' <P>
   In recent months, the FARC has allegedly killed 18 members of
the peace communities, while the paramilitaries purportedly
murdered 21. Three others are still missing (one reportedly at the
hands of the FARC). <P>
   ``In good faith, we have lived up to our commitment and our
decision not to get involved with the armed groups. But the armed
factions force us into things,'' said another member of the peace
communities. ``They ask us for water. We tell them we cannot give
them any - but we are staring down the barrel of a gun, which
tells us `hand it over or die'.'' <P>
   The two delegates were in the capital to demand that the
government fulfill the terms of the accord that paved the way for
the farmers to return to their land. In the agreement, the
government pledged to protect the peace communities and provide
security, as well as a stronger presence of civilian authorities
in the area, in order to guarantee development and social
investment. <P>
   ``We don't want to be displaced again, or to become `the
forgotten ones' of Colombia,'' one of the representatives of the
peace communities added. <P>
   More than 10,000 small farmers, most of them from black
communities in the strategically located, biologically rich
municipalities of Riosucio and Carmen del Darién, were forced by
the violence to abandon their lands four years ago. <P>
   Some took refuge in the banana-export port city of Turbon or
the town of Pavarandó in the department of Antioquia. Others
crossed the border into Panama. <P>
   In October of that year, 5,000 displaced persons who had fled
to Pavarandó decided to return to their land in the department of
Chocó, where they set up the San Francisco de Asís, Natividad de
María and Nuestra Señora del Carmen peace communities, to try to
piece together their lives in the midst of the conflict. <P>
   The risks faced by the peace communities are very serious, said
Catholic priest Alejando Angulo, the director of the Jesuit-run
Centre for Popular Research (CINEP), which has been providing
support for the returning peasant farmers. <P>
   ``The dispute over that territory is very intense, and these
unarmed communities are exposed to the risk of forced or voluntary
displacement,'' Angulo told IPS. <P>
   ``They have no chance of enduring,'' he added. 
<P>
   Organized in large groups, they are trying - ``on their own
initiative, and at their own risk'' - to engage in dialogue with
the various armed factions, said the priest. 
<P>
   As Angulo sees it, a ``certain level of indifference'' by the
state to the serious problems faced by the peace communities has
compounded the army's inability to respond simultaneously at every
point where local communities are facing threats. <P>
   In short, the situation is a consequence of ``the weakness of
the state,'' he maintained. <P>
   Members of CINEP have also felt the pressure of armed groups in
the Atrato River area, although ``not with the same frequency nor
with the same severity with which the population is treated,''
said Angulo. ''We are identified as part of the Church, which wins
us some respect.'' <P>
   In May, President Andrés Pastrana visited the peace
communities, where he delivered collective title deeds, making
them the formal owners of the land. But the lack of security has
not allowed the farmers to get out and work their property. <P>
   ``We are calling on the state to give us the security we need
to work our land; we are frustrated by the lack of security. The
president handed us our land titles, and 15 days later [the armed
groups] began to violently force us off our property,'' said the
delegates visiting Bogota. <P>
   The two men said members of the paramilitary groups were
forcing them off their property in order to implement their own
agribusiness project: to plant 40,000 hectares of African palm
trees. ``The government must clearly define who the land belongs
to. Is it ours? Or who are we taking care of it for?'' they
wondered. <P>
   ``We have issued a call for the international community to show
solidarity with our efforts, and to exert pressure on the
Colombian state to clearly commit itself to protecting our
rights,'' said the peasant farmers, who explained that they had
sent a letter to United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson.</p>
