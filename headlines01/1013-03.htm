Police said about 20,000 people had taken part in Saturday's demonstration, which followed the sixth night of US air strikes.
<P>
Campaigners also staged a march in Glasgow, while demonstrations against the strikes also took place across Western Europe. Earlier, anti-war protests were held in Australia.
<P>
At the London march, protesters carried placards bearing messages such as: "CND says not in my name" and "CND says peace & justice for all".
<P>
The marchers chanted "No war" and "We want peace". They blew whistles and banged on drums. Though noisy the mood was peaceful.
<P>

</table></font>Nigel Chamberlain, of CND told the BBC that it was vital that people collectively voiced their opposition to the UK Government's support of military strikes.

"We think very strongly that this bombing action that is being supported is counter productive and is breaking up the coalition that has been carefully built in the past.
<P>
"And it might well encourage further terrorist acts."

<P>
He said there was a substantial minority across the country opposed to this action.
<P>Mr Chamberlain said it was vital to send out a strong message not just to the British government but also to the American government and governments worldwide.
<P>
He said the US-led strikes were protracted and indiscriminate, not proportionate, targeted or limited as promised. 
<P>
"Civilians do die as a result of bombing raids. 
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="sans-serif" SIZE="2">

	
		
			
</font>"The refugee crisis is accentuated.
<P>
"Tempers are inflamed in the Muslim world against it. 
<P>
"It is making it much more difficult to pursue the political, diplomatic and economic coalition that was being built. 
<P>
"We absolutely agree that the perpetrators must be brought to justice."
<P>
The London rally was originally planned as part of the International Day of Protest to Stop the Militarization of Space.
<P>
However organizers have turned their attention on the strikes
against Afghanistan.
<P>
<B>International court</B>
<P>
Speakers at the rally included Darren Johnson, leader of the Green group on the Greater
London Assembly.
<P>
He told the crowds: "There are thousands and thousands of us here today for peace and justice.
<P>
"The messages here are very simple - stop the bombing of Afghanistan, end the war now and stop the militarization of space - scrap the National Missile
Defense system."
<P>
He said those responsible for the US terror attacks should be brought to justice by legal means in an international court.
<P>
"War is not the answer, you can't fight fire with fire. It will only create more bin Ladens."
<P>
The Muslim Parliament of Great Britain supported the rally.
<P>
Its leader Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui called on community elders and leaders to "channel the disquiet felt by the youth over the war into a peaceful protest campaign".
<P>
CND chair Carol Naughton said the demonstration had been "incredible".
<P>
"We expected a lot of people but this just shows that there really is a big upsurge of people who are opposed to the conflict in Britain," she said.
<P>
The rally was told another major protest would be held on 18 November.
