SYDNEY - A decade long slump in military spending
that followed the end of the Cold War has been reversed and
global weapons purchases are rising again, the United Nations 
said on Thursday.
<p>U.S. opposition has sunk moves to strengthen the Biological
Weapons Convention, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty is
on thin ice and prospects for the entry into force any day soon
of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are bleak.<p>``Whether one looks at the big weapons or the little ones,
the facts are alarming,'' Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N.
Under-Secretary General for disarmament, said in a speech in
Sydney.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="170">

The UN Department for Disarmament Affairs is headed by Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka. Mr. Dhanapala, a career diplomat in the Foreign ministry of Sri Lanka,   held several positions with bodies concerned with disarmament prior to his appointment.

</table></font></font>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, global military spending last year reached $800
billion, or $130 for every person in the world.<p>Dhanapala said that represented a ``major increase'' on 1999.<p>The biggest increases in spending were by developing
nations -- the ones which can least afford it -- and ``Southeast
Asia, Northeast Asia are two major sub regions of concern,'' he
said.<p>To put things in perspective, he told a seminar at Sydney's
Macquarie University that the Washington-based Brookings
Institution think-tank had calculated that total U.S. spending
on nuclear weapons amounted to some $5.8 trillion.<p>If you stacked those dollars, the pile would reach to the
moon and almost all the way back to the Earth.<p>DISAGREEMENT RUBS OUT HARMONY<p>But it's not just the growing stock of military hardware
that has the U.N. disarmament chief concerned.<p>Dhanapala told Reuters earlier on Thursday that a palpable
sense of a ``certain harmony, a certain unity'' that existed
among U.N. Security Council members just after the end of the
Cold War, when everyone agreed over Iraq for instance, had
''worn thin.''<p>``We are beginning to see disagreements,'' he said.
<p>In most of the points he makes, a common thread is the
United States of President Bush.
<p>Bush says he will abandon the ABM treaty, regarded as the
cornerstone of nuclear stability for three decades and affirmed
as such by the prior Bill Clinton administration, so Washington
can pursue plans to develop a missile shield.<p>Clinton was on board during a 6- year international
attempt to give more teeth to the Biological Weapons
Convention. The Bush administration has jumped ship.<p>And the new U.S. President has indicated he is unlikely to
resubmit the CTBT to the U.S. Senate for ratification after the
upper house voted it down.<p>In weapons sales, Dhanapala said the United States alone
was responsible for half of last year's arms trades.<p>Yet he said people should not become disheartened.<p>``In disarmament the glass is always either half full or
half empty depending on how you look at it. I think we must not
be totally pessimistic,'' Dhanapala said in the Reuters
interview.<p>``It is true that we are facing a number of challenges
particularly to multilateral disarmament. But I do know that
the United States upholds the nuclear non-proliferation treaty,
it upholds several other treaties, it would want to continue in
several of our disarmament fora.''<p>Dhanapala said ``a la carte multilateralism'' was an in-word
in Washington and the Bush administration was likely to pick
and chose which multilateral agreements it would like to adhere
to.<p>``But it will soon be realized that that is a game that
other countries can also play and therefore it is not in the
global interest for countries to limit their engagement,'' he
said.</p>
