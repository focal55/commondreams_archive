            A week before sitting down with the U.N. chief to talk about sanctions 
            and weapons inspections, Iraq was basking in worldwide support sparked 
            by U.S. and British missile strikes on the outskirts of its capital. 
            <p> Iraq appeared determine to keep attention focused on the air strikes 
              it said killed two civilians. In a country where public protests 
              are rarely spontaneous, there have been demonstrations every day 
              since Friday's attack. Thousands of marchers &#150; many of them 
              students wearing their gray and blue high school uniforms &#150; 
              on Monday burned American , British and Israeli flags and carried 
              banners declaring "aggression will not scare us and sanctions will 
              not harm us." 
            <p> U.S. and British missiles hit Iraq several times a month, and 
              even when casualties are higher than they were Friday, such protests 
              are rare. But Friday's attack was the first signal from the new 
              U.S. administration of how it would deal with Iraq and was the first 
              strike in several years to come so close to Baghdad and involve 
              so many fighter planes. 
            <p> The United States says the targets were long&#150;range surveillance 
              radar and associated facilities that Iraq has increasingly used 
              to coordinate its defences against U.S. and British patrols in the 
              no&#150;fly zones over southern and northern Iraq. The United States 
              and Britain say Iraq cannot fly its planes over those areas of its 
              territory; Iraqi says the no&#150;fly zones are illegitimate and 
              had planned to raise the issue in talks with U.N. Secretary&#150;General 
              Kofi Annan set for next Monday and Tuesday in New York. 
            <p> Deputy Foreign Minister Nabil Najim told reporters last week that 
              Iraq would demand from Annan "the total and immediate lifting of 
              sanctions and the ending of the almost daily aggression on the southern 
              and the northern parts of the country" &#150; the last a reference 
              to the no&#150;fly zones. 
            <p> Iraq wants the U.N. to lift crippling economic sanctions imposed 
              after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. The United Nations says Iraq must 
              first let inspectors back in to make sure President Saddam Hussein 
              is not developing weapons of mass destruction. 
            <p> No major breakthrough had been expected from the meeting, but 
              hopes were raised because Baghdad requested it and was sending a 
              high&#150;level delegation. In the wake of the missile strikes and 
              bolstered by international support, Iraq may now be less inclined 
              to compromise on the question of inspections and more insistent 
              sanctions be lifted. 
            <p> Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al&#150;Sahhaf, who will lead 
              the Iraqi delegation, said in a weekend letter to Annan and the 
              U.N. Security Council that the U.N. chief should "condemn the dangerous 
              aggression and the increase of tension." 
            <p> Iraq already has heard the attacks condemned around the world. 
              Countries that were key supporters of the coalition that drove Iraq 
              out of Kuwait 10 years ago, like Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Spain 
              and France have criticized the attacks. 
            <p> Russia, which along with France has been pushing for a new international 
              policy on Iraq and questioned the effectiveness of the sanctions, 
              over the weekend said the bombardment was unjustified. 
            <p> Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky left 
              Moscow Monday for Iraq on a trip intended to be a show of support. 
            <p> "The United States and Britain have bombed Iraq for 10 years, 
              humiliating it," Zhirinovsky told reporters Monday before flying 
              out of Moscow. "Can you imagine this logic, according to which they 
              bomb the country to make sure that not one bullet touches an American 
              plane?" 
            <p> Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters 
              in Tehran Monday that the U.S.&#150;British air strikes were "inexplicable," 
              the Iranian news agency IRNA reported. 
            <p> "We regret the carnage of innocent Iraqis and we condemn it," 
              Asefi was quoted as saying. 
            <p> In Malaysia Monday, the main ethnic Chinese opposition party joined 
              Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in condemning the air strikes. Nearly 
              60 percent of Malaysia's 22 million people are Muslim. The Malaysian 
              government supports an end to the sanctions. 
            <p> Indonesia's foreign ministry said in a statement Monday that the 
              attacks only increased the suffering of Iraqis reduced to poverty 
              by the prolonged sanctions. Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, 
              who leads the world's most populous Muslim nation, has often expressed 
              his support for the easing of the sanctions. 
            <p> British member of parliament George Galloway, who has criticized 
              his government's Iraq policy, on Monday visited a Baghdad hospital 
              were Iraqis wounded in the missile attacks were being treated. 
            <p> Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, comfortable that world opinion 
              is on his side, ridiculed the United States and Britain for portraying 
              Friday's attacks as an attempt to protect U.S. and British pilots 
              patrolling the no&#150;fly zones. 
            <p> "America defends itself in Baghdad? It enters the country ...., 
              bombs it, then says it was defending itself?" Aziz said on Iraqi 
              television Sunday night. "This is an unacceptable and disreputable 
              talk by the Americans. It is also condemned by the whole world." 
            <p> One state&#150;owned Iraqi daily called for military retaliation. 
            <p> "Iraq is determined to confront this aggression, improve its means 
              of retaliation to make Iraqi skies like hell for the enemy ravens," 
              said al&#150;Thawra daily in a front&#150;page editorial on Monday. 
            <p> Another state&#150;run paper, al&#150;Qadissiya, said in its front&#150;page 
              editorial that "Iraq has all means to retaliate if such aggression, 
              which shall not pass unpunished, was repeated." 
            <p> Iraq's military was severely weakened by the Gulf War and a decade 
              of sanctions. But defence experts suspect that in the two years 
              U.N. inspectors have been barred, Iraq may have reconstituted some 
              of its chemical and biological weapons programs.
