SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  --
	
	Actor Edward James Olmos told a cheering crowd Monday night that the controversy over the U.S. Navy target range in Vieques "is a problem that extends itself well beyond Puerto Rico."<p>
Olmos was among a group of well-known protesters who each posted $3,000 bail and was released from jail after being arrested in the Navy's restricted areas on Vieques, objecting to the military exercises there. Most of the more than 140 people arrested in Vieques during the weekend remain in jail.<p>

</table></font>Earlier in the day, a cat-and-mouse game on the U.S. Navy target range in Vieques delayed bombing exercises four hours, as protesters sneaked onto the military grounds. There were reports that protesters were burying themselves to hide from military police, but the Navy said it did not find any buried protesters, and bombing resumed about 1 p.m.<p>
In an unusual hearing in a federal jail in San Juan-- closed to relatives and most of the media -- federal judges began setting bail for those arrested through the weekend. Other high-profile protesters released Monday night included environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and New York labor leader Dennis Rivera.<p>
"This is not only a Vieques problem," Olmos told supporters outside the jail. "This is a problem dealing with humans and government. . . . This has to be understood by the world."<p>
Ada and Luis Gutierrez, whose son, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), was
among those detained, traveled here Monday from their central Puerto Rico home
in hopes of seeing their son.<P>
   Rep. Gutierrez reportedly was pushed to the ground and roughed up while
scuffling with Navy Shore Patrol agents on Saturday. Navy officials said he
was being "uncooperative."<P>
   "I want to see if he is hurt," said Ada Gutierrez as she stood with about
200 relatives and supporters outside the jail. "They made him kneel when he
didn't want to. They pushed him to the ground."<P>
   Billy Weinberg, a spokesman for the congressman, claimed that Gutierrez and
several other protesters were taken Saturday to an abandoned building with no
roof, where they were forced to kneel on a rock-strewn floor and were housed
overnight in the structure as it rained.<P>
   More than 20 hours passed after the congressman's arrest before he was
allowed to make a phone call, Weinberg said.<P>
   Lt. Jeff Gordon, a Navy spokesman in Puerto Rico, said Gutierrez wasn't
allowed to make a phone call right away because it took time to transfer him
to the custody of U.S. marshals to be charged.<P>
   "He was detained appropriately with standards for all trespassers," Gordon
said. "They were given food and water and checked on frequently and provided
with medical attention should they need it."<P>
   The protesters were moved Sunday to a federal prison in Guanabo, a suburb
of San Juan.<P>
   On Vieques, the Shore Patrol on Monday arrested eight protesters led by
Ruben Berrios, Puerto Rican Independence Party president, as more New York
politicians headed to Vieques to take their places.
<P>
   "Victory is already ours. ... There is no going back," said Berrios as he
was led away from the Navy's Camp Garcia.<p>
This round of confrontations began Thursday after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., refused Puerto Rico's request for a temporary restraining order to block the training exercises.<p>
Opposition to the Navy's use of the range grew after a 1999 accident in which two off-target bombs killed a civilian guard. Since May 2000, the Navy has used inert ammunition.<p>
In Washington on Monday, the Navy announced it had relinquished 8,148 acres to the municipality of Vieques, the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust and the Department of the Interior. This transfer is part of an agreement reached last year between the White House and Puerto Rico to quell tensions over the Navy's use of Vieques.<p>
The Navy says the range provides unique training that saves U.S. lives in combat.<p>
Protesters who broke onto the target range also delayed bombings Friday and Saturday, while the Navy searched for them. The Navy did not carry out any bombing Sunday in deference to the beatification at the Vatican of a Puerto Rican layman.<p>
Training exercises were scheduled to end today, but officials said they might extend them to make up for lost time.<p>
Activists say there are still about 40 protesters on the range and restricted ground.<p>
