UNITED NATIONS  - The United Nations Centre for Human
Settlements (Habitat) launched its first reports on urban
conditions and trends Monday, stressing that more than 1.2 billion
of the world's population of 6 billion live in inadequate housing.
<P>
"For the first time, the city, rather than the country, is used as
the basic unit of analysis," said Secretary General Kofi Annan
during the reports' release.

</table>The 126-page 'State of the World's Cities Report 2001' and its 344-
page sister publication 'Cities in a Globalizing World: Report on
Human Settlements 2001' depart from a longstanding tradition of
country-level analysis and instead monitor the realities faced by
urban populations.  
<P>
Pointing out that "the world's urban areas are now home to more
than half of humankind - 3 billion people," Annan stressed that
"sustainable urban development is one of the most pressing
challenges facing the human community in the 21st century."  
<P>
Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka, Habitat's executive director, said,
"Homeless people are living in cardboard boxes on sidewalks of
gleaming corporate skyscrapers, whose budgets exceed those of many
countries." 
<P>
The central challenge faced by the global community is how to make
both globalisation and urbanisation work for all the world's
people, instead of benefitting only a few, added Jay Moore, a
principal contributor to the State of World Cities report.  
<P>
Moore added that liberalised trade and finance, without proper
safeguards, have made urban populations everywhere more vulnerable
to external shocks. He highlighted the suffering of poor people in
Bangkok, Thailand as a result of the Asian financial crisis of
1997 and 1998.  
<P>
The Report on Human Settlements argues that technology-driven
options for growth and development - which spur globalisation -
have led to divided cities where the lines of stratification
between people, places and groups are becoming more magnified.  
<P>
Tibaijuka lamented, "We are back to where Charles Dickens was 150
years ago when he wrote 'A Tale of Two Cities'."  
<P>
Cities are hubs of dynamism, change and opportunity but also
places of exploitation, disease and unemployment, Annan said.  
<P>
The reports cite studies showing that while some groups have
improved their housing conditions, a disproportionate share of the
world's population - particularly in poor countries - has seen its
housing situation deteriorate.  
<P>
In Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Rwanda, for example, real incomes have
fallen, the cost of living has gone up, and the number of poor
households has grown, particularly in urban areas.  
<P>
Municipalities in highly industrialised countries obtain an
average of 2,906 dollars per capita in revenue per year. This
figure is almost 200 times the average revenue obtained by African
municipalities, which raise a meagre 14 dollars per capita per
year.  
<P>
According to Habitat, in Africa, only one-third of all urban
households are connected to potable water; in Asia and the
Pacific, a mere 38 percent of urban households are connected to a
sewerage system; in Europe, the processes of social exclusion
marginalise many low income and minority households; and in North
America, problems of residential segregation, discrimination in
housing markets and affordability persist, particularly in larger
cities, despite recent economic growth.  
<P>
The reports argue that traditional goals of urban planning and
development, aimed at supporting cities as engines of economic
growth, are too narrow.  
<P>
"Planners must begin to consider the feminisation as well as the
urbanisation of poverty," Tibaijuka said, emphasising that, "the
majority of the world's poor are women."  
<P>
Moore added, "We have not developed institutions well or fast
enough to govern or run our cities" even as urban centres have
grown to house half the world's population, up from two percent in
1800. 
<P>
"Policies must focus on capacity building, especially at the local
level and in civil society," Tibaijuka concluded.  
<P>
The Habitat reports were released to coincide with a review,
beginning here Wednesday, of progress since the Second World
Conference on Human Settlements was held in Istanbul in 1996.
