            Worried that decades-old public health laws could prevent authorities 
            from battling a 21st century bioterror plague, the Bush administration 
            is urging states to grant health officials sweeping powers in such 
            an epidemic. 
            <P>The administration wants all 50 states to adopt a law allowing 
              public health authorities to take over hospitals, seize drug supplies, 
              quarantine people exposed to infectious pathogens, draft doctors 
              to treat them, force patients to be vaccinated, and order police 
              to restrain residents from leaving contaminated areas. 
            <P>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rushed out the proposed 
              legislation, at the request of Health and Human Services Secretary 
              Tommy Thompson, within weeks after the Sept. 11 hijackings and the 
              ensuing anthrax attacks. 
            <P>In California, Assemblyman Keith Richman, D-Granada Hills, has 
              drafted a measure nearly identical to the CDC model and plans to 
              introduce it early next year. 
            <P>The restrictions on civil liberties that his bill would allow during 
              a bioterror attack are bound to raise controversy, Richman acknowledged. 
              But he said health officials must be allowed to resort to them if 
              the nation faces an outbreak of smallpox, one of the worst possible 
              biological weapons. 
            <P>"Upwards of a third of the people who contract smallpox could potentially 
              die," said Richman, a physician with a degree in public health. 
              "We should have a public health law in place that could minimize 
              that situation as much as possible." 
            <P>Critics of the CDC proposal, however, say it threatens to create 
              a public health "police state" that could spur people to panic and 
              flee, helping to spread deadly germs farther afield. 
            <P>"This law treats American citizens as if they are the enemy," said 
              George Annas, chairman of the Health Law Department at the Boston 
              University School of Public Health. 
            <P>CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency commissioned the model 
              statute well before Sept. 11 because a patchwork of antiquated state 
              laws needed to be updated. It accelerated the process after the 
              attacks and anthrax mailings. 
            <P>Simulations of bioterror attacks have indicated that an outbreak 
              could result in confusion, interjurisdictional conflict and civil 
              disorder, Skinner said. 
            <P>One such simulation was the Dark Winter exercise conducted in June 
              at Andrews Air Force Base, in which a mock president and National 
              Security Council had to grapple with a fictional terrorist release 
              of smallpox in Oklahoma. Within two weeks, the simulated outbreak 
              had mushroomed to 16,000 "cases" in 25 states, hundreds of people 
              were dead and panic riots were breaking out. 
            <P>In that exercise, state leaders proved unprepared to invoke sweeping 
              public health controls. Conflicts erupted between federal authorities 
              favoring central command and state officials who felt they should 
              decide whether to impose quarantines, order vaccinations and shut 
              down transportation. </p>
            <b>INEFFECTIVE STATE LAWS</b> 
            <P>Lawrence Gostin, the Georgetown University law professor who helped 
              draft the CDC model, said many state public health laws not only 
              lack the powers that officials would need, but would actually make 
              it harder to carry out such crucial steps as making sure suspected 
              bioterror victims are reported to health authorities. 
            <P>At the same time, he said, many of the laws dating from the late 
              19th or early 20th centuries do not include up-to-date civil rights 
              safeguards. 
            <P>"This (model) law gives far more protection of civil liberties 
              than there is in existing law," he said. 
            <P>Civil rights protections, however, are exactly what opponents find 
              lacking. The kind of public health emergency that would trigger 
              extraordinary powers for health officers is defined so broadly that 
              it could include AIDS, HIV infection or a severe flu epidemic, said 
              Tanya Ehrmann, director of public policy at the activist group AIDS 
              Action in Washington, D.C. 
            <P>Annas said that under the legislation, people could be detained 
              without a court order and isolated in stadiums or clinics without 
              an adequate process to challenge the decision. The proposed law 
              would also shield health officers from liability, along with anyone 
              working at their direction, for deaths or health damage suffered 
              by quarantined bioterror victims, he said. 
            <P>Under the measure, "if you kill people or hurt them, that's tough," 
              said Annas, one of 10 New England health law scholars urging Thompson 
              to change the draft law. "The families can't sue, nobody can sue." 
            <P>Joanne Hustead, senior counsel at the Health Privacy Project at 
              Georgetown University, said the CDC proposal is an important effort 
              to strengthen public health laws. But she said the broad definition 
              of a health emergency would allow the collection and sharing of 
              protected private health information under circumstances that don't 
              involve bioterrorism. 
            <P>In California, such issues could be worked out as Richman's bill 
              is considered in the Legislature, said Bruce Pomer, executive director 
              of the Health Officers Association of California. 
            <P>Existing California laws authorize health officers to take measures 
              such as quarantining tuberculosis patients who fail to take medication, 
              or requiring certain vaccinations for schoolchildren. But Pomer 
              said the state may need to reconsider civil rights safeguards that 
              could hamper health officials in a bioterror attack. </p>
            <b>PRIVACY CONCERNS</b> 
            <P>Placer County public health Director Richard Burton, president 
              of the Health Officers Association, said AIDS and HIV-positive patients 
              have won safeguards against having their identities revealed to 
              health authorities, and that such protections should be spelled 
              out for them in Richman's legislation. 
            <P>Kevin Reilly, deputy director for prevention services at the state 
              Department of Health Services, said the agency is reviewing the 
              model law and has not yet taken a position on it. Gostin and his 
              co-authors are reviewing comments on the draft law and will release 
              a modified version by Dec. 12. 
            <P>Mohammad Akhter, executive director of the American Public Health 
              Association, said the organization will consider its position on 
              the CDC model law at a Dec. 17 meeting. But he said that in general, 
              public health officials need more resources rather than more legislation. 
            <P>"If you don't have the early warning system, the training of doctors, 
              nurses and paramedics, and the capability of hospitals to take care 
              of patients exposed, no amount of legislation is going to protect 
              our people," Akhter said. "You have to focus on the right things."
