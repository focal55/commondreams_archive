WASHINGTON  - Acting within 24 hours of the House of
Representatives, the U.S. Senate approved Thursday sweeping anti-
terrorism legislation that civil liberties groups said could
violate the Constitution and basic rights.
<P>
The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/vote1071/vote_00313.html" target="_new">98-1 vote</a> <i>(Voting nay - Russ Feingold (D-WI) ) </i>came amid growing concern about anthrax attacks
against lawmakers and other Washington officials through the mail.
The House passed the same measure by <a href="http://clerkweb.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.exe?year=2001&rollnumber=398" target="_new">357-66</a> Wednesday. 
<P>
President George W. Bush, who has pressed Congress over the last
two weeks to take swift action, is expected to sign the package
into law Friday. 
<P>
Bush got virtually all but the most draconian measures he had
included in the anti-terrorism bill, which he submitted to
Congress in the aftermath of Sep. 11 terrorist attacks on New York
and the Pentagon. 
<P>
The bill greatly expands federal agencies' authority to conduct
surveillance and wiretapping operations and secret searches
against terrorist suspects while reducing judicial oversight. 
<P>
The bill also imposes much stronger penalties on those who harbor
or finance terrorists and greatly reduces the due-process rights
and recourse to judicial review of immigrants suspected of
terrorism. For example, suspect immigrants could be held for up to
seven days before being allowed to appeal to a judge. 
<P>
Other controversial measures include giving the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) director authority to identify priority
targets for intelligence surveillance within the United States, a
function from which the CIA previously was barred, and broadening
the definition of ''domestic terrorism'' in a way that could
subject people engaged in political protest to wiretapping and
even criminal prosecution. 
<P>
The package also greatly strengthens existing laws against money
laundering and adds terrorism, fraud, corruption, and smuggling to
the list of offenses subject to federal money-laundering laws. 
<P>
Passage of the new law, which follows five weeks of intense debate
and negotiation, comes as other countries take similar action in
the wake of last month's attacks. 
<P>
The governments of Canada and India, for example, have tabled far-
reaching measures that international and local human rights and
civil liberties groups, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human
Rights Watch</a> (HRW), have warned will expand the powers of the
state at the expense of judicial oversight and key democratic
freedoms. The European Union (EU) also is considering legislation
that could greatly reduce the rights of immigrants, in particular. 
<P>
The groups also have voiced strong concerns about the U.S.
legislation, particularly as regards its effects on non-citizens.
HRW and the New York-based <a href="http://www.lchr.org/" target="_new">Lawyers Committee for Human Rights</a>
(LCHR) have argued that the bill effectively permits the Justice
Department to detain non-citizens indefinitely if they cannot be
deported and so long as it believes the suspect represents a
threat to national security. 
<P>
''Non-citizens no less than citizens have a right to freedom from
arbitrary or indefinite administrative detention,'' said HRW
director Kenneth Roth. ''As the U.S. defends itself from
terrorism, it must also strengthen its defense of the freedoms
that are the hallmark of the country.'' 
<P>
Even without the new bill, civil liberties groups have grown
increasingly concerned about the continued detention by federal
authorities of almost one thousand people - almost all non-citizen
Muslims - in connection with the Sep. 11 attacks. Most are being
held either as ''material witnesses'' or on minor immigration
offenses. 
<P>
On Wednesday, Amnesty voiced concern about the punitive conditions
under which many of these people were being held and questioned
whether their rights to legal representation and full due process
were being fully respected. One of the detainees, a Pakistani who
had overstayed his visa, died of an apparent heart ailment in jail
earlier this week after being held for more than a month. 
<P>
''It just underscores our concern that there needs to be more
openness and transparency about this process,'' said Jeanne
Butterfield, head of the <a href="http://www.aila.org/main.html" target="_new">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a>.
''We've been clamoring for information about who is being
detained and do they have access to counsel. But I can't get
anything.'' 
<P>
Many of the more controversial provisions of the new law,
particularly those affecting immigrants' rights, are expected to
be challenged in the courts, according to Nancy Chang, a senior
attorney with the <a href="http://www.humanrightsnow.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR). 
<P>
''As constitutional challenges to the legislation wind their way
through the courts, the judiciary will be presented with the
choice of upholding the Constitution or acquiescing in its
surrender,'' she said. 
<P>
One plaintiff is certain to be the <a href="http://www.aclu.org" target="_new">American Civil Liberties Union</a>
(ACLU), which expressed ''deep disappointment'' both with the
content of the legislation and the way it was moved through
Congress. 
<P>
Noting that the final version of the bill, which replaced another
version that emerged from protracted negotiations between
Republicans and Democrats in the House, was sent to the floor at a
time when House offices were closed off due to the anthrax scare,
it described the expedited vote as ''deeply flawed and an offense
to the thoughtful legislative process necessary to protect the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.'' 
<P>
Still, lawmakers with strong civil liberties records who voted for
the bill said they had extracted important concessions from the
administration, which had originally requested, for example, that
immigrant suspects be detained indefinitely without any judicial
review. 
<P>
In addition, they succeeded in imposing a ''sunset clause'' on
many of the more controversial measures extending the surveillance
powers of the federal government. While the administration had
asked that these powers be made permanent, under the bill passed
Thursday, they will expire after four years unless Congress votes
to extend them. 
<P>
''In provision after provision, we added safeguards that were
missing from the administration's plan,'' declared Senator Patrick
Leahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman. ''We have done our utmost
to protect Americans against abuse of these new law enforcement
tools.''
