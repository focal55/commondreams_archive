LIVERMORE --  
Outsiders would presume that impassioned Berkeley-type bumper stickers 
wouldn't go over too well in Livermore, the Tri-Valley city that definitely 
hugs with its nuclear arms and probably wouldn't think that one nuclear bomb 
(OK, OK an undetonated one) would spoil its whole day.
<P>Yesterday morning, though, Livermore motorists crossing the intersection of 
Portola Road and Murrieta Boulevard near the Interstate 580 onramp could not 
help but notice the eye-popping 24-foot billboard that would have seemed more 
fitting on Telegraph Avenue.
<P>No, not Panda Express' giant shrimp speared by a chopstick. Check the other 
side.
<P>There, next to an ominous black-and-white photograph of the target chamber 
of the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, is a 
message in blood red letters: "Nuclear Weapons Science? NIF is intended to 
train a new generation of bomb designers." Then there's this all-caps kicker, 
aimed specificly at the 8,000 employees of the Lab: "Your mind is a terrible 
thing to waste."
<P>This is the work of a group called the <a href="http://www.igc.org/tvc/" target="_new">Tri-Valley Communities Against a 
Radioactive Environment,</a> a hearty band of activists that has been tilting at 
billboards and laser projects in this nuclear company-town for years.
<P>What began humbly in 1983 with a "Food Not Bombs" bake sale outside the 
local Nob Hill Foods has mushroomed into a movement of 2,900 card-carrying 
pacifists who try their darndest to voice concerns about the Lab's work with 
nuclear arms.
<P>To most residents in the community, Tri-Valley CARES is something of a 
fifth column, saboteurs who want to derail the very engine of Livermore's 
economy.
<P>"Livermore is solidly behind the Lab and NIF," Mayor Cathie Brown said. 
"I've gone to Washington to lobby extensively for it, with the overwhelming 
support of the community. Tri-Valley CARES has a right to free speech, but I'm 
concerned with the whole community."
<P>So, too, is Marylia Kelley and her group. An unassuming woman with flowing 
red hair, Kelley could easily pass for just another Livermore homemaker. Which 
she is. But she also has a cause.
<P>"Our group exists to make visible that there's no consensus in Livermore 
about nuclear weapons," said Kelley, the founder. "I remember way back when we 
started. I woman walked up to me at the bake sale and began to cry. All she 
could say was, 'Thanks for being here. I thought I was the only one in town 
who thinks nuclear weapons are immoral.' "
<P>Tri-Valley CARES has come a long way since those bake-sale days. The $5,000 
monthly bill for the billboard, Kelley says, mostly comes from donations from 
charitable foundations and members. The group has become one of the most 
influential and dogged anti-nuke organizations in the country, with a yearly 
budget of $150,000. Last year, it was honored by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency for its public participation in the agency's hazardous-waste 
cleanup activities.
<P>But Tri-Valley CARES doesn't limit itself to toxic cleanup. As its 
billboard states, it wants nothing less than Livermore scientists and 
engineers to shed their white coats and work on peaceful "civilian" projects 
either at the lab or elsewhere.
<P>Two such scientists -- Issac Trotts and Andreas Toupadakis -- were on hand 
yesterday for Tri-Valley CARES' press conference. Trotts, a computer scientist, quit the NIF in March after five months, saying he was misled about the 
program's focus. Toupadakis, a chemist who worked both at Livermore and Los 
Alamos, left a $91,000 NIF job a year ago because "they were building new 
bombs, not cleaning them up." NIF is best known for its big-budget 192-beam 
weapons-testing laser under construction, but its scientists also are stewards 
for existing weapons.
<P>Susan Houghton, spokeswoman for NIF, disputes the ex-employees' claims. She 
said that international test-ban treaties preclude the development of new 
weapons but that "as weapons deteriorate, we replace the parts with newer 
parts to ensure that the weapons will function."
<P>A lab scientist who worked with Trotts dismissed Trotts' accusation that 
new weapons are being built. "That's a classic CARES argument, but it's just 
not true," Sean Ahern said. "The actual nuclear warheads themselves have not 
changed. His definition's wrong."
<P>To Tri-Valley CARES, it's not mere semantics. Trotts and Toupadakis said 
that improving the accuracy and deadliness of existing weapons is tantamount 
to building new ones.
<P>Toupadakis, who worked for the Department of Energy for 10 years making 
sure plutonium for existing warheads remained potent decades after being 
constructed, pointed to the billboard and issued a challenge to his former lab 
workers.
<P>"My former colleagues need to ask themselves if they can still go back to 
their houses, look at their children in the eyes and continue to believe that 
they really do work for peace when they do the work for war," he said.
<P>Toupadakis has yet to land a job since his vocal departure from the lab, 
and Kelley says her group is trying to establish financial help via no-
interest loans for scientists like Toupadakis who choose to leave the 
Department of Energy.
<P>It didn't take Trotts long to find a new job, though. He leaves today for 
Boulder, Colo., where he will design video games for Sony Play Station II.
<P>"And not to worry," he added, "they are not violent video games."
