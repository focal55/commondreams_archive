WASHINGTON — For many Americans among the more than one million debtors whose financial troubles are expected to drive them into bankruptcy next year, the route to a fresh financial start will be far more complicated under a bill that is now before the Senate and appears likely to become law.
<P> The bill would overhaul the nation's century-old bankruptcy system and eliminate the concept that many types of debts — notably credit-card debts and other loans that are not secured by a house or anything else of value — can be wiped out by a trip to bankruptcy court.</P>
<P> For many debtors, the idea that bankruptcy offers a true, fresh start would disappear.</P>
<P> After emerging from bankruptcy, they would still be responsible for paying off some of their unsecured debts, even if that meant dividing their paychecks between old credit- card bills and current child-support payments, alimony and other court- enforced obligations.</P>
<P> The bill has been endorsed by President Bush and is being championed by the credit-card and banking industries, which say they have been harmed by a dramatic increase in the number of personal bankruptcies. </P>
<P> During last year's election campaign, they backed up their lobbying effort with millions of dollars in political contributions to key members of Congress and with some of the largest corporate donations to Mr. Bush. The bill, which has already been passed by an overwhelming margin in the House, is expected to be approved by the Senate late this week.</P>
<P> About 1.3 million Americans declared bankruptcy last year, an increase of 75 percent since 1990. Financial analysts say enactment of the bill would mean billions of dollars in extra profits for credit-card issuers over the next decade.</P>
<P> The bill's goal, supporters say, is to stop abuse of the system by many debtors who are shirking their responsibility to pay back their debts, even though they have money to do so. </P>
<P> "All of us end up paying for the unscrupulous who abuse our system," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "People with high incomes can run up massive debts, and then use bankruptcy to get out of honoring them."</P>
<P> The banking industry says that bankruptcies drive up the cost of borrowing for everyone else by $400 to $500 per person per year. </P>
<P> Todd J. Zywicki, a bankruptcy specialist at the law school at George Mason University in Virginia, said, "I can see no good reason why a schoolteacher earning $30,000 a year should have to pay more for a mortgage or more for a new couch because some guy making $100,000 a year finds it inconvenient to pay his debts."</P>
<P> The problem with the bill, opponents say, is that it would impose severe financial penalties on people who are forced into bankruptcy through no fault of their own — because of medical problems or layoffs, for example. President Bill Clinton vetoed a nearly identical bill last year, describing it as too harsh on debtors.</P>
<P> Critics say the bill also does nothing to end what is perhaps the most notorious abuse of the system in some states: a loophole that allows people with extravagant spending habits who are facing bankruptcy to shift millions of dollars of assets into a house, which can then be shielded from creditors under what is known as the homesteading exemption.</P>
<P> The bill would deny the exemption for a home bought within two years of a bankruptcy filing, but critics say that would simply encourage people with lots of assets to buy a mansion and then hold off their creditors for two years before going to bankruptcy court.</P>
<P> The vast majority of people entering the bankruptcy court could only dream of such a home.</P>
<P> Economic researchers say that nearly two-thirds of the people who file for bankruptcy report significant periods of unemployment before their filings. According to a 1999 study by federal bankruptcy judges, the median income for Americans filing for bankruptcy the year before was $22,000 a year.</P>
<P> Perhaps the bill's most important provision is a requirement that people who meet a certain income test — generally, that they have enough income to pay off at least 25 percent of their debts over five years — be barred from filing under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, which allows people to erase most of their unsecured debts.</P>
<P> Instead, they would be forced to file under Chapter 13, which requires some repayment under a court-approved plan. Currently, about three out of four people file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. When debtors choose Chapter 13, it is often because they want to take advantage of the provision that allows them to keep their homes.</P>
<P> The bill would continue to allow the unemployed or people with relatively low incomes to file under Chapter 7, but it would impose several new logistical hurdles on them, including additional paperwork and the completion of a credit-counseling program.</P>
<P> While the bill's sponsors say that the income test and the paperwork requirements would not be onerous on truly impoverished debtors, critics say that even a few additional impediments could persuade them to give up entirely on the bankruptcy system.</P>
<P> "I fear this will end up creating an underground economy," said Lawrence P. King, a law professor at New York University. "People will go off the books. They'll ask to be paid in cash. They'll get a false Social Security number. They'll move.</P>
<P> "In my 40 years of dealing with Congress on bankruptcy legislation, this is the worst I've ever seen," Professor King continued. "It's the kind of bill that makes you want to point your fingers at individual congressmen and say, `Shame on you.' "</P>
<P> Opponents of the bill include many economists and lawyers who say they are also alarmed about changes it makes in the system of business bankruptcies. Under the bill, a single creditor could block the bankruptcy reorganization of a company, threatening the company's viability and the paychecks of its employees.</P>
<P> If a reorganization is delayed too long, "the only other alternative is liquidation," said Brady C. Williamson, a Wisconsin lawyer who led a federal commission that reviewed bankruptcy laws in the 1990's. "And that's not good for either creditors or employees."</P>
<P> The opponents say they are also concerned about provisions of the bill that appear designed to benefit special interests at the expense of other creditors, creating the appearance of unfairness in what is being billed as "reform" legislation.</P>
<P> At the request of lobbyists for the automobile industry, the bill eliminates rules that allow debtors entering bankruptcy to repay only an automobile's market value, not the full loan amount. </P>
<P> The White House has refused to say if Andrew H. Card Jr., President Bush's chief of staff, lobbied for the change before joining the White House while employed as a senior executive at General Motors<org idsrc="NYSE" value="GM,GMH,GM-G"></org> and president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. "It has absolutely no bearing on his current role as chief of staff," said a spokesman, Scott McClellan.</P>
<P> Opponents of the bill had at least a moderate victory today, when Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, forced a voice vote on the Senate floor to approve an amendment intended to prevent lenders facing bankruptcy from trying to sell off high-interest "predatory" loans. It was the first — and only — amendment approved on the Senate floor in more than a week of debate on the bankruptcy bill.</P>
