WASHINGTON  - One historian calls it a ``disaster for
history,'' but the White House insists a new executive order issued
by President Bush balances the public's right to see the records of
past presidents with a need to protect national security.
<p>
	   Advocates for the release of government documents say the
executive order violates the spirit of the 1978 Presidential
Records Act and will usher in a new era of secrecy for papers left
behind by America's chief executives.
<p>
	   The White House says the order simply sets up a procedure for
implementing the act and gives former presidents more authority to
claim executive privilege to withhold certain papers. Absent
``compelling'' circumstances, the incumbent president will agree
with a former president's decision to disclose or withhold
documents, the White House says.
<p>
	   Bruce Craig, director of the National Coordinating Committee for
the Promotion of History, claims the order is ``blatantly unlawful
top to bottom.'' He predicted a quick legal challenge to the order,
which probably will come up at a hearing Tuesday by a House
Government Reform subcommittee. The hearing was scheduled for last
month but was canceled in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror
attacks.
<p>
	   Craig said that under the order, if a former president says
certain papers are privileged, they will remain secret even if the
sitting president disagrees. Conversely, if a sitting president
says certain papers from a past administration are privileged, they
will remain under wraps even if the former president disagrees.
<p>
	   ``In the interest of keeping historical papers closed, the
incumbent president can trump the wishes of a former president,''
says Craig, who claims the order is ``a disaster for history.''
<p>
	   In a letter, Bruce Lindsey, lawyer for the William J. Clinton
Foundation, said the former president objects to Bush's executive
order because laws already exist to restrict disclosure of
sensitive documents, The Washington Post reported Friday.
<p>
	   The act affects the presidential papers of Clinton, Bush's
father, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. It also applies to
vice presidential papers, including those of former President Bush.
<p>
	   Reagan's papers are the first governed by the Presidential
Records Act, which followed Watergate and Richard Nixon's attempts
to hold on to his papers and tape recordings. The act made
presidential records the property of government, not ex-presidents.
<p>
	   Some 68,000 pages of Reagan's White House records, including
vice presidential papers from the elder Bush, were supposed to have
been opened under the law in January, 12 years after Reagan left
office. The White House delayed the release three times to review
constitutional and legal questions, and Thursday's executive order
resulted.
<p>
	   White House counsel Alberto Gonzales defended Bush's executive
order but did not say when the Reagan papers would be opened to the
public.
<p>
	   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the order provides a
``safety valve'' for a current administration. A former president,
out of office for 12 years, might not recognize national security
implications of releasing certain documents, he said.
<p>
	   Fleischer emphasized that ``except in very compelling cases, if
a former president were to say `That (document) should go out,'
this administration would say, ``It should go out.''
<p>
	   Moreover, any claims of executive privilege, including those
involving military, diplomatic or national security secrets, legal
work or advice, presidential communications or the deliberative
processes of the president and his advisers, can be appealed in
court, Gonzales said.
<p>
	   ``It will not be driven by politics or what looks good. It will
driven by what is allowed under the Constitution,'' Gonzales said.
<p>
	   Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American
Scientists' government secrecy project, thinks the order will make
it harder for the public to gain access to historically valuable
presidential papers because both the former president and the
incumbent must consent to disclosure.
<p>
	   A private citizen will have little luck trying to persuade a
court to overturn a claim of executive privilege, he said. ``When
Joe Blow goes into court to overturn it, he's probably going to
lose,'' Aftergood said.
<p>
	   Some historians, including American University historian Anna
Nelson, have suspected the Bush White House is worried about what
the Reagan papers might reveal about officials now working for
President Bush who also worked for Reagan. Among them are Secretary
of State Colin Powell, Budget Director Mitch Daniels Jr. and White
House Chief of Staff Andrew Card.
<p>
	   Gonzales says that is not the reason.
<p>
	   ``There may in fact be embarrassing documents,'' he said, but
that would not be considered a legitimate reason to withhold
something.
<p>
	   Other historians suggest the White House is taking advantage of
heightened public interest in national security after the terror
attacks on New York and Washington. Craig speculated that the Bush
White House might be worried the war on terrorism may generate
documents it would rather not see exposed down the road.
<p>
	   ``Everybody is in agreement that materials that can be used by
terrorists to threaten national security should be closed up,''
Craig said. ``There already are existing laws and exemptions that
keep that kind of stuff closed up.
<p>
	   ``This is about confidential information - communication between
a president and top people - that they would simply prefer not to
be released to the public.''
