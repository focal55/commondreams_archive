            BOGOTA, Colombia - Brushing aside human rights concerns, President 
            Andres Pastrana signed ``war legislation'' granting Colombia's U.S.-backed 
            military expanded powers to battle insurgents, his office announced 
            Thursday. 
            <p>
	   U.N. rights monitors, human rights groups and some members of
the U.S. Congress have criticized the measure, fearing it will lead
to abuses in Colombia's 37-year war.
<p>
	   The law, which Pastrana signed without fanfare on Monday, is
expected to be challenged by its opponents in the nation's
Constitutional Court and could affect deliberations on future U.S.
military aid to this South American country.
<p>
	   One of the law's most criticized articles allows the president
to set up martial law zones called ``theaters of operations,'' in
which local civilian officials would be subordinate to regional
police and military commanders.
<p>
	   The law also allows soldiers to detain suspects longer before
handing them over to a judge.
<p>
	   Amnesty International, in a statement from New York, said:
``There is serious concern that these provisions could facilitate
torture or other forms of human rights violations of those captured
during counterinsurgency operations.''
<p>
	   The law also shortens the time allowed for completing
investigations into alleged human rights abuses by security force
members and requires civilian prosecutors to report to the military
on their investigations into terrorism and war crimes including
torture.
<p>
	   A leading Colombian human rights activist said the measure would
militarize the country.
<p>
	   ``There will be arrests without warrants, interrogations of
civilians on military bases and impunity for soldiers and police
who have violated human rights,'' predicted Gustavo Gallon,
director of the Colombian Jurists' Commission.
<p>
	   Pastrana has not spoken publicly on his decision to sign the
National Defense and Security Law, which Colombia's congress
approved in June.
<p>
	   But one of the law's authors said Colombia needed tougher
legislation given the nation's serious crisis. ``The Colombian
people are cornered by violence,'' Sen. German Vargas said. ``We
need instruments to defend ourselves.''
<p>
	   The military, which pushed hard for the legislation, says
Colombia's laws have hamstrung its ability to fight leftist
guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.
<p>
	   Generals complain that top officers get tied up in lengthy human
rights investigations and that the military often must free
guerrilla suspects because they are captured in remote areas where
there are no judicial authorities.
<p>
	   Pastrana faces conflicting pressures to give the military
greater rein in the war while also curbing its human rights abuses
- the latter a condition for receiving military aid from
Washington.
<p>
	   Elected on a peace platform three year ago, one of the
president's legacies may be helping the military gird for war. In
addition to tougher legislation, Pastrana's tenure has brought the
armed forces dozens more combat helicopters, high-tech intelligence
aids and is more than doubling the number of professional troops.
<p>
	   U.N. rights monitors last month objected to seven of the law's
69 provisions, saying they were either unconstitutional or violate
international human rights treaties.
<p>
	   Democrats in the U.S. Congress also raised concerns last month
during hearings about future aid to Colombia. They spoke of
possible aid cutbacks and called for State Department monitoring of
the law's implementation.
<p>
	   Washington' is providing $1.3 billion support for Pastrana's
so-called Plan Colombia, which is aimed at undercutting drug
production and depriving the rebels of millions of dollars they
earn ``taxing'' narcotics production.</p>
