QALAYE NIAZI, Afghanistan  - U.S. warplanes killed
over 100 people in a raid on a village in eastern Afghanistan,
residents said Monday, as British troops arrived in the capital
to take up peacekeeping duties.
<p>At least one fighter jet, a B-52 bomber and two helicopters Sunday morning swooped on the village of Qalaye Niazi, about
2.5 miles north of the city of Gardez, capital of eastern
Paktia province, villager Janat Gul told Reuters.
<p>Paktia province is where U.S. forces have been carrying out
operations against remnants of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda
network and Taliban fighters still on the run.
<p>``There are no al Qaeda or Taliban people here,'' said Gul,
referring to the group blamed for the September 11 attacks in
the United States, and the former government which sheltered
it.<p>The raid seemed sure to stir up tensions between factions
in Afghanistan's interim administration which want the U.S.
bombing campaign, under way since October 7, to halt, and those
who believe it should continue.<p>The Defense Ministry, headed by General Mohammad Fahim,
says the bombing should end as soon as possible while Foreign
Minister Abdullah Abdullah said Sunday that ``the campaign will
continue for as long as it takes to finish the terrorists.''<p>There are also tensions within the administration, headed
by Hamid Karzai, over the role of foreign forces on Afghan
soil.<p>But an advance column of about 50 British troops drove into
Kabul Monday to take up peacekeeping duties, the vanguard of an
international security force that was agreed with the new
government.<p>The new administration and Britain have initialed an
agreement on deployment of the force, authorized by the U.N.
Security Council to fill the security vacuum in Afghanistan
after the collapse of the Taliban, a British official said on
Monday.<p>The force is eventually expected to number 3,000.<p>SOLE SURVIVOR<p>Janat Gul said 24 members of his family were killed in the
pre-dawn U.S. bombing raid on Qalaye Niazi, and described
himself as the sole survivor.<p>

``People are very upset about what is going on here,'' he
said.<p>Paktia province borders Pakistan and is southwest of the
jagged canyons of Tora Bora -- one of the last stands of al
Qaeda fighters. It was heavily bombed in early December when
bin Laden was believed to be hiding there.<p>At least 12 houses in Qalaye Niazi were razed. Amid the
destruction, a Reuters Television cameraman saw scraps of
flesh, pools of blood and clumps of what appeared to be human
hair. Huge craters had been blasted out by the strike.<p>A member of the local tribal shura, or council, said they
had invited U.S. forces to the village to see the damage and to
find out what had happened.<p>In the U.S., Major Pete Mitchell -- a spokesman for U.S.
Central Command -- said: ``We are aware of the incident and we
are currently investigating.''<p>Reuters passed several four-wheel drive vehicles containing
U.S. forces, accompanied by soldiers of the Northern Alliance
which took Kabul in November, at the Tira Pass, apparently en
route to the village. They refused to allow photographs or to
speak to reporters.
<p>The Pentagon believes remnants of al Qaeda and the Taliban
may be still in Paktia. Several raids have been carried out
there in the last few days.
<p>One of the most deadly took place just two days before the
inauguration of the new government, when U.S. jets hit a convoy
carrying tribal elders and guests to the ceremony in Kabul.<p>Some 65 people were killed in that attack, and interim
leader Hamid Karzai has told tribal elders that he would ask
the Americans to cut back their raids in the region.<p>With bin Laden, the main target of the U.S. war on
terrorism, still at large and possibly hiding in Afghanistan,
U.S. troops were on their guard throughout the country.<p>In the south, Marines prepared to hand over to arriving
U.S. paratroopers a Kandahar airport facility, including a
detention camp where detained Taliban members and al Qaeda
fighters are being interrogated as to his whereabouts.<p>The Pentagon said the deployment of paratroopers from the
101st Airborne Division in southern Afghanistan would free
Marines operating there for unspecified duties, possibly to
join the hunt for bin Laden.
