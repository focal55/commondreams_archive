UNITED NATIONS - European Union (EU) officials say anti-personnel landmines pose 
a grave threat in Afghanistan. Their warning comes as human rights advocates accuse 
the U.S. administration of trying to abandon proposals to banish the deadly weapons 
from its own military arsenal . 
<p> Ambassador Stephane de Loecker of Belgium, speaking on behalf of the 15-member 
EU, says recent weeks' events have shown that landmines are a major humanitarian 
problem. 
<p> "The situation in Afghanistan - one of the countries most affected by unexploded 
mines and devices - was a sad illustration of this fact," he said. 
<p> Between March 1978 and December 2000, at least 2,812 people have been the 
victims of mines or unexploded ordnance in Afghanistan, U.N. figures show. The 
average number of casualties worldwide is estimated at over 150,000 annually, 
mostly women and children. 
<p> The United Nations warned last week that landmines and unexploded U.S. cluster 
bombs posed a serious risk to humanitarian workers as they prepare to mount relief 
operations in Afghanistan. 
<p> Although an overwhelming majority of the 189 member states have either signed 
or ratified the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, the United States, Russia, Israel, Pakistan, 
and India remain among several notable holdouts. 
<p> Loecker has told delegates here that landmines not only have a devastating 
effect on human lives but also are an obstacle to post-conflict development in 
war-ravaged countries. 
<p> "The presence of mines was often an obstacle to the convoying of humanitarian 
aid since, in many cases, detours had to be made before the people could be reached," 
he said. Regrettably, these observations also applied to many other regions of 
the world, he added. 
<p> The warning against landmines coincides with a report from the New York-based 
Human Rights Watch (HRW), which said that the Pentagon is seeking to roll back 
U.S. policy on the use of anti-personnel landmines. 
<p> Citing unnamed government sources, HRW says U.S. defence officials have recommended 
that the United States abandon its standing commitment to join the Mine Ban Treaty 
by 2006, even if alternatives to anti-personnel mines are identified and fielded. 
<p>
<p> "The existing U.S. policy to eliminate anti-personnel mines over time appears 
to be in jeopardy," said HRW's Mark Hiznay. 
<p> He said the Pentagon's moves are a component of a multi-agency landmine policy 
review. He pointed out that officials in the Department of State and the National 
Security Council will now join the review before President George W. Bush makes 
a final decision by the end of this year. 
<p> Hiznay said HRW believes that in any meaningful review, the Bush administration 
should reject the Pentagon's recommendation. The argument advanced by some U.S. 
defence officials, that anti-personnel mines are essential, should not be accepted 
without critical examination, he added. 
<p> Norwegian diplomat Arne Birger Honningstad said there has been a "dramatic 
decrease" in the production and export of landmines since the adoption of the 
anti-mine treaty in 1997. But anti-personnel mines still represent a threat to 
millions of people and are a significant obstacle to economic and social progress, 
he noted. 
<p> "The fact that 15 governments and 30 rebel groups were using the weapon was 
unacceptable," he said, refusing to name names. 
<p> He also said that at least one unnamed country that had signed the treaty 
might be violating it by deploying landmines. This was very "disturbing", he added. 
<p> Ambassador Masood Khalid of Pakistan said it was "alarming" that more than 
60 developing nations were suffering because of the irresponsible use of landmines 
resulting either from foreign occupation or internal conflict. 
<p> In Afghanistan alone, about 10 million landmines were scattered throughout 
the country. The victims were treated in Pakistani hospitals, he added. 
<p> Laotian official Alounkeo Kittikhoun said more than three million tons of 
explosive ordnance was dropped on his country, leaving it a dangerous legacy not 
widely known within the international community. 
<p> "No other country in the history of modern warfare had withstood the kind 
of aerial bombardment as Laos did during the 1964-1973 Indochina war", he said. 
<p> Since the war ended more than 25 years ago, some 12,000 accidents have involving 
unexploded ordnance have occurred, causing some 6,000 deaths, he added.
