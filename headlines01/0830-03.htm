SYDNEY - The United Nations  on Thursday urged
President Bush  to keep his plans for a missile shield down on
earth and to preserve outer space for peace.
<p>``Hitherto outer space has been militarized we concede but
not weaponized. There has been no placement of weapons in outer
space,'' said U.N. Under-Secretary General for disarmament
affairs Jayantha Dhanapala in an interview.
<p>``I believe it is vitally important that we should preserve
outer space for peaceful purposes and the development of
missile defenses should in no way violate the present
non-weaponized state of outer space,'' Dhanapala told Reuters in
Sydney.

</table></font>Bush has given long-simmering U.S. plans to build a missile
shield new impetus and says Washington intends to opt out of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty -- the bedrock of
nuclear stability through the Cold War.
<p>The United States says a missile shield would be aimed at
''rogue'' states such as North Korea and Iraq.
<p>But the plans have alarmed China and Russia and raised
fears even among U.S. allies that it could spark a new arms
race.
<p>Bush's vision of a National Missile Defense  involves a mix
of land- and sea-based and aircraft-borne systems to shoot down
incoming missiles and is likely also to feature some role for
space.
<p>Dhanapala said a commission chartered by Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld had endorsed a view that the United
States should seek total domination of space, indicating that
could be a future direction of U.S. policy.
<p>SPACE WHIZ MILITARY CHIEF
<p>Bush also this month appointed an expert in computer and
space warfare, General Richard Myers, to head the military
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
<p>The world's nuclear powers agreed in 1967 in the Outer
Space Treaty not to place nuclear weapons in space.
<p>Dhanapala also expressed more general reservations about
the U.S. president's missile defense plans and his intention to
withdraw from the ABM treaty.
<p>While U.N. member states had the freedom to decide on their
own security arrangements, he said any abrogation of the treaty
or multilateral push to build a missile shield could carry an
''enormous cost.''
<p>``It's going to certainly according to the stated intentions
of some countries lead to the production of more missiles,''
Dhanapala said.
<p>``So what we are going to see is perhaps an increase in
tension...we are probably going to see a deterioration in the
international peace and security situation unless of course
there is some kind of collective agreement among the nuclear
weapons states which will help to salvage the present
situation.''
<p>China is already modernizing its relatively small
collection of around 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
<p>Dhanapala said Beijing had made it clear to him that that
process would be accelerated if Washington went ahead.
<p>``My discussions with the Chinese, discussions I've had in
Beijing and elsewhere, indicated this,'' he said.
<p>High-ranking U.S. officials have blitzed around the world
to consult other countries over missile defense and to explain
the Bush administration's point of view.
<p>The U.N. disarmament envoy welcomed the consultations,
saying he hoped they led to agreements on disarmament.
<p>He also said he had taken note of a suggestion by Bush that
the United States would be willing to unilaterally slash its
nuclear warheads as part of a missile shield plan.
<p>But Dhanapala said the United Nations preferred
multilateral treaties to unilateral promises for the simple
reason that they were irreversible, and could be verified and
legally enforced.</p>
