A federal program that permits developers to destroy wetlands if
they re-create similar landscapes elsewhere has failed to stem the loss
of wetlands nationwide, including in Southern California, a National
Research Council panel concluded in a report released Tuesday.
<p>The council, an advisory body of the National Academy of Sciences,
reviewed the status of hundreds of replacement wetlands and found that
some were never started, some were not completed and others bore little
resemblance to naturally functioning wetlands.
<p>Nature's own plumbing, the marshes, swamps and bogs that constitute
wetlands, improve water quality by filtering pollution, help control
floods by sponging up excess flow and stabilize shorelines. Wetlands also
provide sustenance for a host of rare birds and other wildlife.
<p>Retaining wetlands is important because the nation has lost so much of
them--about 50% in the lower 48 states since 1780. Southern California
has lost more than 90% of its coastal wetlands to development.
<p>Historically, many wetlands were turned into farms. More recently,
they have become prime real estate in many areas of the United States,
offering easy access to water and desirable ocean and river views.
<p>The National Research Council's report raises sweeping questions about
the track record of the federal program that allows landowners to fill
natural wetlands if they commit to restoring degraded wetlands or
creating artificial wetlands on once-dry land.
<p>Of 70 wetlands-replacement projects assessed in Orange County, the
report said only 30 were successful.
<p>"Drawing [a wetland] on a map does not make it so. I think we need
more truth in advertising about our ability to renew wetlands," said Joy
B. Zedler, the panel chairwoman who holds the Aldo Leopold Chair of
Restoration Ecology at the University of Wisconsin. "Review after review
of restored versus naturally occurring wetlands show they fall short."
<p>The report accuses the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the
federal program, of failing to ensure that developers comply with
requirements. It says the corps has neglected to monitor many artificial
wetlands to ensure that they actually function as they are designed to,
with a mix of soil, plants, animals and water found in naturally
occurring marshes and swamps.
<p>The federal Clean Water Act forbids discharging soil and sand into
waters of the United States, which includes most wetlands. Confronted
with development pressures, however, federal officials devised a system
in which landowners could apply for permits to fill wetlands providing
that they restored, created, preserved or enhanced other wetlands nearby.
<p>The stated federal objective since 1990 has been "no net loss" of
wetlands--meaning that the acreage and functions of replacement and
preserved wetlands should counterbalance the loss of wetlands by
development, agriculture and other causes.
<p>But although wetland losses have slowed in recent years, the goal of
"no net loss" has not been met, the report concludes.
<p>From 1974 to 1983, according to the panel, the nation experienced a
net loss of 2.5 million acres of wetlands. Between 1986 and 1997, the
loss was 644,000 acres, even after factoring in newly created and
restored wetlands. Those figures were based on U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service research.
<p>"We're still losing wetlands functions, but we're just not losing it
as fast," said Suzanne Van Drunick, director of the council's study.
<p>Scientists involved in the study were stymied by poor record-keeping
by the Corps of Engineers. In fact, corps data on existing projects
proved so scanty that scientists said they could not calculate the total
wetland acreage created and restored in recent years, compared to the
number of acres destroyed.
<p>The corps acknowledged in a statement Tuesday that information is
lacking. "Because we do not gather compliance data," the statement read,
"we can neither confirm nor deny whether we are meeting 'no net loss.' "
<p>The report strongly urges the corps to track wetlands lost and gained
over time in a national database. It describes hearing from corps staff
"that there are consistently more [wetlands] permit applications than
there is time for corps staff to perform adequate reviews."
<p>The report also said the corps rarely monitors replacement sites for
more than five years, even though restored and created wetlands seldom
comply with federal requirements within five years.
<p>"Up to 20 years may be needed for some wetland restoration of creation
sites to achieve functional goals," the report adds. The panel
recommended that developers be required to create or restore wetlands
before destroying existing ones. It also called for broader searches for
the best sites for replacement wetlands. It recommended searching through
entire watersheds rather than choosing sites close to the wetlands to be
destroyed. The federal government has normally opted for nearby sites.
<p>Both the corps and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which
also oversees wetlands, praised aspects of the scientists' findings
Tuesday.
<p>"They certainly make clear that we have a lot of work to do. And that
fundamental conclusion that they don't believe we've achieved no net loss
is something that we have to take seriously," said John Meagher, director
of the EPA wetlands division in Washington.
<p>In their statement Tuesday, officials at corps headquarters agreed
with many of the report's recommendations but added that "because of
limited funding, we will not be able to accomplish all of them."
<p>An official of the National Assn. of Homebuilders also had good things
to say about the report.
<p>"The report recognizes that we've made significant progress in
mitigation over the past 20 years, but that there are some challenges
ahead and some improvements that need to be made," said Susan Asmus, vice
president of environmental policy for the association.
