LUENEBURG, Germany  - Hundreds of German environmental activists brought a heavily guarded train
carrying nuclear waste to a halt by rushing massed ranks of riot police and sitting on the tracks close to its
destination.
<P>
<P> The train carrying slag from a French plant that reprocesses fuel rods from German reactors had covered the 950
miles from La Hague in Normandy to Lueneburg, south of Hamburg, without incident -- although it took one of the
biggest peacetime security operations Germany had ever seen to keep the line open.

</table>Some 200 mostly young protesters broke through riot police lines in late afternoon and began a sit-in at
Lueneburg, 30 miles short of the station where the waste was to be unloaded and moved by road to the Gorleben
dump on Wednesday.
<P>
<P> Police have some 20,000 officers on hand to try to prevent the running battles that marred previous shipments
before they were banned three years ago. They dragged most of the protesters bodily from the tracks but there was
little violence.
<P>
<P> The train was due to reach Dannenberg later in the evening, from where six wagon-sized armoured containers
were to move 25 km (16 miles) to Gorleben on Wednesday.
<P>
<P> Earlier a group of Greenpeace activists in inflatable power boats evaded police to protest on a rail bridge they
said was too weak. Police held dozens of protesters at other sit-ins.
<P>
<P> Demonstrators and police engaged in games of cat-and-mouse as the train wove a secret route across the heart
of Germany. It had crossed the French border, 500 km (300 miles) from Gorleben, under cover of darkness just
before midnight on Monday.
<P>
<P> Under pressure from France to ease a backlog of German waste at its La Hague reprocessing plant near
Cherbourg, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder lifted the transport ban imposed on safety grounds in 1998. About two
cargoes a year are now planned.

Special police forces arrest Greenpeace activists hanging from a bridge in Seerau near the northern German town of Dannenberg, March 27, 2001. Some 50 Greenpeace activists occupied the bridge to stop a nuclear waste transport of six helium-sealed Castor containers enroute to Dannenberg. The controversial shipment of spent nuclear fuel is expected to unleash major demonstrations on its way to a storgage facility in the nearby Gorleben dump some 20 km (14 miles) away from Dannenberg.

</table></font></font>CALLS FOR CALM
<P>
<P> Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, one of Schroeder's ecologist Greens coalition allies and himself once a
protester at Gorleben, called for calm. He sees the waste shipments as an integral part of deal he struck with the
electricity industry last year to phase out Germany's 19 reactors by about 2025.
<P>
<P> But protesters say they want not so much to block the waste altogether -- it has to go somewhere -- but to make
handling it so expensive that the industry shuts down its reactors now.
<P>
<P> "We want to make these transports so expensive that they are neither economically feasible nor politically
justifiable," said pensioner Helmut Piethers, huddling by a campfire near Gorleben.
<P>
<P> While younger "eco-warriors" are in the vanguard of taking on police, Piethers was not untypical of the angry
thousands gathered around Gorleben on the sparsely peopled western bank of the river Elbe, which once formed
the border with East Germany.
<P>
<P> Organisers expect 10,000 to block the trucks on Wednesday. Last time, police used water cannon to force the
road open.
<P>
<P> Germany sends spent fuel rods to France where most of the uranium is recovered. The small amount of waste is
superheated into a form of glass which is then sealed in metal canisters.
<P>
<P> Each of the train's six wagon-sized white armoured containers called Castors -- the name is short for Casks for
Storage and Transport of Radioactive Material -- holds 28 such canisters and weighs over 100 tonnes.
<P>
<P> The radioactive canisters will be kept in warehouses at Gorleben pending a decision in several years time on
their final disposal. One possibility is burial in a nearby salt mine.
