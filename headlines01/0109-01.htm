UNITED NATIONS  - A coalition of about 280 non-
governmental
organisations (NGOs) from 70 countries Monday urged governments to
curb the
global trafficking in small arms which is responsible for the
deaths of
hundreds of thousands of civilians worldwide. 
<P>
The International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), which
launched its
global campaign on the opening day of a two-week preparatory
meeting here on
the illicit trade in small arms, said about half a billion of
these weapons
are
currently in circulation outside lawful control. 
<P>
''Gun running sustains bloody combat and repression the world
over, but the
proliferation of small arms has been particularly devastating in
Africa,''
says
Conmany Wesseh, Director of the Centre for Democratic Empowerment
in
Liberia, a
member of IANSA. 
<P>
Professor Wendy Cukier of Canada's Coalition for Gun Control,
points out that
gun running contributes to the deaths of more than half a million
people each
year. 
<P>
''For every death, many more are injured and traumatised. The
death rates in
many countries at peace are as high as those at war,'' she adds.  
<P>
Moreover, unlike illicit drugs, which are generally illegal
throughout their
trafficking life, virtually all illicit arms begin as legal
weapons - whether
in the hands of state armies, police or civilians, she argues. 
<P>
In July the United Nations will hold a major conference on the
'Illicit Trade
in Small Arms and Light Weapons'. 
<P>
The preparatory meeting, which began Monday, is expected to
discuss both
substantive and procedural issues relating to the upcoming
conference. The
conference will approve a programme of action to help curb the
flow of small
arms and adopt political declaration setting out commitments by
the UN's 189
member states. 
<P>
Perhaps the most sensitive issue before the conference will be the
question of
balancing the sovereign right of states to safeguard their
national security
with the pressing need to regulate the proliferation of small arms
and light
weapons. 
<P>
The preparatory committee, comprising all 189 member states, is
expected to
establish several working groups to deal with the following:
measures to
prevent, combat and eliminate the illicit manufacture,
acquisition,
stockpiling
and transfer of small arms; measures related to stockpile
management, safe
storage and destruction of illicit surplus small arms; and
measures related to
transparency and exchange of information. 
<P>
Since 1997, there have been a number of global and regional
initiatives to
curb
the illicit trade in small arms: a moratorium on the import,
export and
manufacture of small arms in West Africa initiated by the Economic
Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) and the Inter-American Convention
against the
Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition,
Explosives and
Other Related Materials. 
<P>
Additionally, the European Union has a Joint Action on Small Arms
while the
Council of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has
an agreement
on the Prevention and Combating of Illicit Trafficking in Small
Arms and
Related Crimes. 
<P>
''Governments have talked about the need to stem the proliferation
of small
arms,'' says Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms
Division of
Human
Rights Watch. But so far, he says, it has been all talk - and no
action.  
<P>
Human Rights Watch is not only calling for binding codes on arms
transfers,
but
also the establishment of transparency measures, including annual
reporting of
arms sales, and the creation of a UN Register for Small Arms. 
<P>
The existing eight-year-old UN Arms Register, on the other hand,
only records
the import and export of fighter aircraft, combat helicopters,
missiles,
warships and heavy artillery - and excludes small arms. 
<P>
A UN expert panel has identified ''small arms'' to include assault
rifles,
pistols, sub-machine guns, light machine guns, mortars, portable
anti-aircraft
guns, grenade launchers, anti-tank missile and rocket systems,
hand grenades
and anti-personnel land mines. 
<P>
Hilterman also points out that many of the weapons on the black
market at some
point were legally transferred by governments or with government
approval.
''And governments have failed to rein in unscrupulous arms
traffickers or
enforce arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers,'' he
notes. 
<P>
Michel Rocard, a former French prime minister and head of an
Eminent Persons
Group on small arms, says the preparatory process for the
conference is at
once
promising as it is discouraging. 
<P>
On the one hand, the gap between supplier and recipient States is
manifesting
itself with respect to scope and mandate for the conference, he
adds.  
<P>
At issue is whether or not to restrict the conference scope to
illicit
traffic,
or to keep calls for transparency and accountability in licit
production and
transfer included. 
<P>
''Unfortunately, parochial political, economic and security
interests of a few
(arms) supplier States are impeding, if not derailing the
process,'' he warns. 
<P>
In a report released last year, the Eminent Persons Group, said
the
majority of
small arms producers are located in the First World while the
majority of
victims of small arms are in the Third World. 
<P>
The Group includes several former and present political leaders
including
Alpha
Oumar Konare of Mali, Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia and Narasimha
Rao of
India, as well as the former head of the Iraqi arms inspection
team Rolf Ekeus
and former World Bank chief Robert McNamara.  
<P>
The Group pointed out that the five permanent members of the UN
Security
Council, namely the United States, Britain, France, China and
Russia, account
for around 85 percent of the global arms trade. 
<P>
At the same time, about 40 percent of the worldwide flow of small
arms is
attributed to illicit trafficking while the majority of illicit
weapons
originate in the licit trade. 
<P>
Since 1990, says the report, small arms have been the primary
choice of
weaponry in 47 of the 49 civil conflicts.
