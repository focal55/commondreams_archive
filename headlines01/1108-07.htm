LONDON &#150;&#150;  In a potentially unwelcome message in advance of weekend talks with President Bush, Pakistan's president said Thursday that civilian casualties in Afghanistan were fueling perceptions of an unjust war.

</table></font>Gen. Pervez Musharraf's concern, voiced amid talks with European leaders, stood in contrast to confident public assessments of the month-old military campaign delivered a day earlier in Washington by Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
<p>
Bush and Blair predicted the American-led coalition would triumph over the al-Qaida network of Osama bin Laden, chief suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But both Bush and Blair said the campaign would take time.
<p>
After hour-long talks at 10 Downing St. with Blair on a chilly, rain-slicked evening, Musharraf said he supported a "short and targeted" campaign in Afghanistan.
<p>
He used precisely the same words earlier in Paris, where he met President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday &#150; reflecting a view he has held since the airstrikes' earliest days.
<p>
Musharraf and Blair last held talks in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, on Oct. 5, two days before the start of the American-led air assault.
<p>
The bombardment targets bin Laden's fighters and Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, but an undetermined number of civilians have been hurt or killed as well. The Pentagon says it has no casualty estimate, but insists Taliban claims are wildly exaggerated.
<p>
Whatever the true numbers, Musharraf warned that scenes of civilian suffering &#150; images widely seen on satellite television in parts of the world &#150; were hurting the coalition's image.
<p>
"It is being perceived, in the whole world, as if this is a war against the poor, miserable, innocent people of Afghanistan," he told reporters in Paris.
<p>
Continued bombardment during Ramadan, Islam's holy month, "will have a negative fallout in the entire Muslim world," the general said, adding that he intended to bring up the matter with Bush at a meeting during U.N. General Assembly debate.
<p>
"The sensitivities of Ramadan have to be considered," Musharraf said later in London.
<p>
The allies have given no indication there will be any respite linked to the Muslim holy month, which begins around Nov. 17. The precise date is determined by the sighting of the new moon.
<p>
While expressing misgivings about a drawn-out campaign, the Pakistani leader suggested that good intelligence could accomplish more than military might.
<p>
"What is missing is accurate intelligence," he said. With it, "the physical objectives ... could be done in a very short time," he said after meeting with Blair.
<p>
Pakistan is the only country with diplomatic ties to the Taliban, but as Musharraf embarked on this trip, his government moved to restrict the activities of the Afghan envoys.
<p>
The Taliban consulate in the Pakistani port city of Karachi was ordered closed and the Taliban ambassador, Abdul Salam Zaeef, said he was told to stop his regular press briefings at the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad.
<p>
However, Musharraf said Pakistan has "no intention" of breaking off relations with the Taliban, saying the continued ties provide "a useful diplomatic window."
<p>
Thanks to its decision to side with the United States in the confrontation over bin Laden, Pakistan &#150; once the closest Taliban ally &#150; has won the lifting of some U.S. economic sanctions that were imposed after it carried out nuclear weapons tests.
<p>
Musharraf said he would ask Bush to implement a congressional decision to fully lift all sanctions, and he pressed French and British leaders for debt relief and other financial aid.
<p>
This was Musharraf's first foray out of the country since the Sept. 11 attacks. The general, who himself took power in a 1999 coup, said he believed his position was secure in his absence.
<p>
"There is no risk involved. I know the support I enjoy in Pakistan," he said in Paris.
<p>
Since allying itself with the United States, Musharraf's government has faced sometimes violent street demonstrations by Islamic groups sympathetic to the Taliban.
<p>
Blair thanked Musharraf for his "strong, courageous" support of the coalition, adding: "We understand the difficulty that has posed for you."
<p>
The Pakistani leader said only a small minority of his compatriots hold anti-coalition sentiments.
