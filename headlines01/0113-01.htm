            George W Bush's nominee to be the next US attorney general has been 
            linked to an extremist pro-gun lobbying group which believes that 
            the answer to America's school shootings is to allow pupils to be 
            armed in the classroom. 
            <P>The revelation that former senator John Ashcroft has recent links 
              with the militant Gun Owners of America (GOA) group is the latest 
              twist in an increasingly impassioned partisan battle over a nomination 
              which has become a major trial of political strength for Mr Bush. 
            <P>Even many conservatives consider the GOA to be extremist. After 
              a shooting at an Oregon school in May 1998 in which two pupils were 
              killed by a fellow student, it issued a press release headed: "Lesson 
              of school shootings: More guns needed at schools". 
            <P>Its director, Larry Pratt, was forced to resign as co-chairman 
              of Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential bid after news leaked of his 
              links with the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations and rightwing militia 
              groups. Mr Pratt is also head of an anti-immigrant organisation 
              called English First. 
            <P>It emerged yesterday that Mr Ashcroft wrote a friendly handwritten 
              letter in March 1998 to Mr Pratt, thanking him for drawing his attention 
              to provisions in a juvenile justice bill which imposed increased 
              penalties for gun law offences. As a result of the GOA's lobbying, 
              Mr Ashcroft, who had originally been a sponsor of the bill, withdrew 
              his support for the legislation. 
            <P>The letter was sent on Senate notepaper and was addressed "Dear 
              Larry" and signed "Thanks! John". 
            <P>This is not the only known link between Mr Ashcroft and Mr Pratt. 
              The two men know each another from a secretive but highly influential 
              rightwing religious group called the Council for National Policy, 
              of which Mr Pratt is a member and whose meetings Mr Ashcroft has 
              attended. The CNP's membership is almost a who's who of US conservatism 
              and includes the Republican congressional leaders Senator Trent 
              Lott and Congressman Tom DeLay. 
            <P>The revelation of the link with Mr Pratt came as two other allegations 
              about Mr Ashcroft's extreme rightwing links also surfaced. 
            <P>In the first, it was confirmed that Mr Ashcroft took time off from 
              his bitter senatorial contest last September to meet Thomas Bugel, 
              the president of the St Louis chapter of the Council of Conservative 
              Citizens, to discuss the case of a CCC member, Charles Sell, jailed 
              by federal authorities on charges of conspiring to murder an FBI 
              agent. 
            <P>The CCC is the successor organisation of the Citizens Council, 
              which led the fight against integration in the South in the 1950s 
              and 60s. The CCC, whose supporters also include Senator Lott and 
              Senator Jesse Helms, opposes interracial marriage and non-white 
              immigration, and believes black people are genetically less intelligent 
              than whites. It is currently mobilising to try to defeat a statewide 
              referendum in Mississippi in April to remove the Confederate flag 
              from the state flag. 
            <P>Meanwhile, the ultra-conservative Bob Jones University in South 
              Carolina confirmed that it possessed a transcript of reportedly 
              inflammatory remarks made by Mr Ashcroft in a May 1999 speech there. 
              The Senate judiciary committee, where Mr Ashcroft faces confirmation 
              hearings next week, had asked the university to supply a transcript, 
              after rumours surfaced about the speech. 
            <P>Bob Jones University, whose graduates include the Rev Ian Paisley, 
              was at the centre of a political storm last year when Mr Bush made 
              a speech there to rally conservative support for his presidential 
              bid after he lost the New Hampshire primary to John McCain. The 
              university had a ban on inter-racial dating and supports a doctrinaire 
              anti-Catholic view of the world. 
            <P>Mr Ashcroft's nomination has become the latest flashpoint of America's 
              political culture wars, with both sides preparing for a major confrontation 
              next week. On Thursday, Mr Bush urged Mr Ashcroft's opponents to 
              "tone down their rhetoric". 
            <P>Mr Ashcroft spent yesterday trying to shore up support among moderate 
              Republican senators who support abortion rights, an issue he strongly 
              opposes.
