WASHINGTON, Apr 9  - The administration of President George
W. Bush wants
Congress to approve major increases in aid to Colombia and its
neighbours in
2002 as part of the next level in its long war against drugs. 
<P>
In particular, he's asking for a total of almost 800 million
dollars in
bilateral economic and security assistance for Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia,
Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela, and Panama, according to the fiscal
year 2002
international-affairs budget submitted to Congress here Monday. 
<P>

</table>Aside from those big aid boosts, Bush appears to have opted for a
policy of
continuity in US aid priorities for fiscal 2002. He has decided to
ask
Congress, for example, to approve the same level of funding for UN
and other
multilateral agencies as had been committed by the administration
of former
President Bill Clinton. 
<P>
That includes some of Clinton's more controversial commitments
which have been
opposed by Republicans in Congress, including 25 million dollars
for the UN
Population Fund (UNFPA), 107.5 million dollars for the Global
Environment
Facility (GEF), and more than 90 million dollars for the Korea
Energy
Development Organisation (KEDO), which was created in a 1994
accord with North
Korea which Bush has said he wants to review. 
<P>
Although the total international affairs request - at just under
24 billion
dollars - comes to about five percent more than what Congress
approved for
2001, most of the difference derives from one-time investments in
upgrading US
embassies and the State Department's antiquated communications and
information
system. 
<P>
To compensate for those costs, and increases in bilateral aid to
South
America,
the administration has proposed reducing appropriations for
Washington's
export
credit agencies (ECAs), the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas
Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC). 
<P>
But US multinational businesses, the ECAs main clients, have
pledged to fight
those cuts and are mobilising their considerable lobbying
resources to press
Congress into restoring them. 
<P>
The aid request submitted Monday will be taken up by Congress over
the next
four or five months. Although Bush is likely to have an easier
time than
Clinton, whose aid requests were often bitterly opposed by the
Republican
majority in Congress after 1994, it is unlikely that a final bill
will be
approved until just before the new fiscal year begins, Oct. 1, at
the
earliest. 
<P>
In addition to the anticipated fight over ECA funding, some
lawmakers,
including Republicans, will clearly want to play with the numbers.
The Senate,
for example, voted for a resolution that favoured increasing
funding to fight
the global HIV/AIDS epidemic by about 50 percent next year, to one
billion
dollars by 2003. 
<P>
The State Department budget, by contrast, called for a ten percent
increase in
2002 over the current level of some 460 million dollars. 
<P>
As in years past, Israel and Egypt, which will receive some three
billion
dollars and 2.1 billion dollars, respectively, in economic and
military aid,
will be the biggest aid recipients under the new request. 
<P>
Multilateral economic and development agencies, like the World
Bank and the
regional development banks, will also receive a big chunk of the
total - about
1.4 billion dollars, including 186 million dollars in voluntary
contributions
to specialised UN agencies, such as UNFPA and the UN Development
Programme
(87.1 million dollars). 
<P>
Despite Republican unhappiness with some UN peacekeeping
operations, the
administration also asked for full funding of all assessed
contributions to UN
operations, at 844 million dollars for 2002, as well as another
879 million
dollars for assessed contributions to some 44 international
organisations,
including the United Nations. 
<P>
Bilateral aid to Eastern Europe and the states of the former
Soviet Union will
also remain constant under the new request, at 1.4 billion
dollars, the
same as
this year, of which ten percent is earmarked for Yugoslavia,
another 120
million dollars for Kosovo, and 45 million dollars for Macedonia
where recent
fighting between Albanian rebels and government forces evoked
concerns about a
new Balkan War. 
<P>
The most startling increases, however, are to go to South America
as part of
the ''war against drugs''. Bush wants to provide 731 million
dollars in new
funding for the 'Andean Counterdrug Initiative' (ACI), a
continuation of the
'Plan Colombia' to which Washington has already committed some 1.6
billion
dollars. 
<P>
Plan Colombia, a joint US-Colombian programme designed primarily
to train,
equip, and advise Bogota's military and police forces to take
control of the
major coca-growing region of Putumayo in southern Colombia and
eradicate coca
and opium poppy fields, has drawn strong expressions of concerns
from most of
Colombia's neighbours who fear the ''spillover'' effects of the US-
backed
campaign in the region. 
<P>
The new aid plan appears designed to answer those concerns. Under
ACI,
Colombia
is to receive 399 million dollars in 2002, of which 252.5 million
will be used
for interdiction and eradication, and 146.5 million dollars is to
be used for
alternative development programmes and aid to the Colombian
justice system and
local non-governmental organisations (NGOs). 
<P>
Peru, whose current aid level is only 48 million dollars, will
receive 156
million dollars next year, Bolivia 101 million dollars, and 39
million
dollars,
all about equally divided between military and development aid, if
Bush's plan
is approved. 
<P>
In addition, Ecuador will receive an additional 30 million dollars -
up from
five million dollars this year - in economic support to support
structural
reform, while Peru will get 10 million dollars for similar
purposes, up from
2.2 million dollars this year. 
<P>
Brazil is to receive 15 million dollars in drug-related
assistance, Venezuela
10 million dollars; and Panama 11 million dollars. Those figures
represent
increases from two million dollars; 1.2 million dollars; and one
million
dollars, respectively. 
<P>
Aside from the anti-drug effort, military training assistance is
also set to
increase by about 10 percent next year. While the total amount
earmarked for
the International Military Education and Training (IMET) comes to
only 65
million dollars, Washington proposes to more than double IMET
programmes for
Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Yemen. 
<P>
Foreign military financing (FMF), a programme which promotes arms
transfers,
will also increase from 3.6 billion dollars to 3.7 billion dollars
under the
new request.  
<P>
Countries receiving major increases include Nigeria, which is
slated to
receive
10 million dollars; South Africa, six million dollars; the
Philippines, 19
million dollars (up from 2 million dollars); Kazakhstan, 2.75
million dollars;
Ukraine, 4.8 million dollars; the Caribbean region, 5.5 million
dollars;
and El
Salvador, 3.5 million dollars.
