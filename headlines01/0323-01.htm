UNITED NATIONS  - Future conflicts all over the globe
could be
fought over water, if human beings are not careful with the
precious resource,
UN Secretary General Kofi has warned. 
<P>
''In this new century, water, its sanitation, and its equitable
distribution
pose great social challenges for our world,'' Annan said on the
occasion of
World Water Day 2001 being observed Thursday.  <P>

</table>The difficulties in achieving full access to safe water and
adequate
sanitation
are compounded by increasing competition for scarce water
resources in most
countries of the region, the Economic and Social Commission for
Western Asia
(ESCWA), based in Beirut, Lebanon emphasised.  <P>
''There are many countries that are today in distress when it
comes to water
.... drinking water is going to be a serious problem,'' Annan
stressed.  <P>
More than one billion people lack access to a safe water supply,
according
to a
World Health Organisation (WHO) report released Thursday.  <P>
Forty percent of the human race, some 2.4 billion people, lack
adequate
sanitation and 3.4 million die every year of water-related
diseases, said the
WHO report entitled 'Water for Health - Taking Charge'.  <P>
Polluted water affects the health of 1.2 billion people yearly,
and
contributes
to the death of 15 million children under five, Klaus Toepfer,
Executive
Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said Thursday.  <P>
Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, kill another 1.5 to 2.7
million people
per year, with inadequate water management a key cause of such
diseases, said
UNEP's Global Environment Outlook Report 2000.  <P>
''These disease outbreaks create widening circles of misery,
illness and death
with dire economic and social impacts for the people concerned,''
Toepfer
emphasised.  <P>
Annan emphasised that those most affected by water shortages rank
among the
poorest in the world - as well as the least healthy. ''In fact,
the absence
of a safe water supply contributes to an estimated 80 percent of
disease and
death in the developing world,'' Annan stressed.  <P>
''History provides grim reminders that failure to manage our water
resources
properly has caused the end of civilisations,'' Toepfer said,
pointing to the
fall of the Mesopotamian civilisation in what is now Iraq and Iran
and the
Aksum empire in what is modern Ethiopia.  <P>
''If we solve every other problem in the Middle East but do not
satisfactorily
solve the water problem, our region will explode,'' the late
Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a water engineer once said.  <P>
Indeed Israeli officials recently raised the spectre of a 'water
war' with
Lebanon as Lebanese villages prepare to pump water from the
Hasbani River
which
flows through both countries.  <P>
''Nobody heard me say wars break out over water, but factually
that is
correct,'' Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's hardline minister for
infrastructure
told The Financial Times, hinting at the prospect of military
action if
Lebanon
began pumping Hasbani water.  <P>
Syria and Iraq embrace the cause of Kurdish guerrilla leader
Abdullah
Ocalan in
the bloody rebellion he set in motion against Turkish rule as a
way of
applying
pressure on Turkey to release more water into the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers
which are held back by a series of dams in Turkey's southeastern
provinces.  <P>
Ocalan was given money, arms and political cover though both Syria
and Iraq
have fiercely repressed their own Kurdish populations.  <P>
Stressing that water is a ''major security issue'' ESCWA
emphasised Thursday
that ''water scarcity continues to be and will remain through the
near future
a leading concern for all water consuming sectors''.  <P>
Seven of the 13 ESCWA member states are among the world's poorest
countries in
water - with per capita water shares of less than 500 cubic metres
per year.  <P>
According to ESCWA, though progress has been made in urban areas,
rural
communities are still inadequately served, in terms of both
quantity and
quality of drinking water as well as sanitation facilities.  <P>
In some ESCWA countries - including Iraq and Syria - less than 50
percent of
the rural population has safe drinking water and less than 20
percent have
adequate sanitation.  <P>
''Countries that control water are likely to be the big winners of
the
future,'' former US Senator Paul Simon wrote in a new book
entitled 'Tapped
Out', which examines global water problems. ''The world's
population will
double in the next 40 to 90 years, Simon said, ''our water supply,
however, is
constant''.  <P>
ESCWA reiterating the UN Secretary-General's Millennium Report
urged member
states Thursday to renew their commitments to reduce by half,
between now and
2015, the proportion of people who lack sustainable access to
adequate sources
of affordable and safe water.  <P>
''Safe, clean water for drinking and sanitation is simply the
fundamental
condition for bettering the human lot,'' Koichiro Matsuura,
Director
General of
the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation pointed
out.
