WASHINGTON  - At a time when still-fragile civilian
governments
are trying to consolidate their hold in Latin America, the United
States is
pouring unprecedented amounts of aid and other forms of support to
the
region's armed forces, according to a new report released here
Thursday.
<P>
In the year 2000, Washington provided well over a billion dollars'
worth of
training, equipment, weapons and other kinds of support to Latin
American
military and police - almost twice as much as it provided the
region in
bilateral development aid. <P>
It marked the first time since the winding down of the civil wars
in Central
America that the United States supplied more military and security
assistance than economic or development aid, according to Adam
Isacson of
the Center for International Policy and co-author of the new
report, 'Just
the Facts: A Civilian's Guide to US Defence and Security
Assistance to Latin
America and the Caribbean'. <P>
Moreover, that trend looks likely to increase over the next two
years at
least, especially in light of recent statements by senior
officials of the
incoming George W. Bush administration who have suggested that US
military
aid to Colombia's neighbours may figure high on their agenda as
Bogota
carries through its US-backed army offensive into the southern
part of the
country to challenge guerrilla control there. <P>
''If I were the neighbouring countries, I'd worry about the
spillover as
well,'' warned Defence Department Secretary-Designate Donald
Rumsfeld during
confirmation hearings here last week. <P>
The new report, a close look at all US aid to military and police
forces in
the region, is the third in its annual series and covers mostly
1999 data
culled from State Department, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), and
Pentagon documents. The Pentagon, which is not bound to disclose
nearly as
much information about its training and other programmes as the
State
Department, released its relevant 2000 documents only in the past
week,
after the report went to press. <P>
''2000 was an especially busy year for the Pentagon in Latin
America,''
according to Isacson, who cited in particular the appropriation of
1.3
billion dollars in support of 'Plan Colombia,' the US-backed
effort to
reduce coca and opium production in southern Colombia by training
and
equipping the army and police to battle the leftist insurgency
which
controls much of the region where the plants are grown. <P>
Under the plan, Washington provided some 950 million dollars in
military and
police aid to Colombia alone, as well as tens of millions of
dollars more to
the armed forces of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, including the
refurbishment
of a key air base in Ecuador to be used by US spy planes, as well
as
Ecuadorean aircraft in Washington's ''war against drugs''. <P>
Indeed, the same four countries - which constitute the drug war's
''ground
Zero'' - accounted for more than 90 percent of all military and
police aid
Washington provided to Latin America last year, according to Joy
Olson, the
second co-author and director of the independent Latin American
Working
Group (LAWG) here. <P>
Virtually all of the equipment and weapons supplied to Latin
American
countries are provided under Washington's counter-narcotics
programmes, she
said. <P>
But US military training in the region has also grown at a
spectacular rate
in recent years, according to the report. <P>
On the basis of recently released documents, the two co-authors
concluded
that Washington changed between 13,000 and 15,000 Latin American
military
police personnel in 1999 - up from about 10,000 the previous year.
For 2000,
they said, the total has almost certainly risen substantially
beyond the
1999 level, as a result of the initiation of Plan Colombia which,
among
other things, called for the training of two new anti-drug
battalions for
the Colombian army. <P>
''The United States trains more military personnel from Latin
America than
from East and South Asia, the Middle East, and the former Soviet
Union
combined,'' said Olson.  <P>
Outside NATO, only South Korea, where Washington permanently
deploys 37,000
troops as a deterrent to North Korea, was to receive more military
training
than Colombia in 2000, she added. <P>
In addition, the US military now provides training programmes to
every
country in the Americas except Cuba. ''The training programme in
Latin
America is huge,'' according to Olson, who also noted that more
than 55,000
US military personnel travelled to Latin America and the Caribbean
for
training and engagement in 1999. <P>
Unlike US equipment, the training is not provided only by anti-
drug
programmes, according to the report. In 1999, it said, US Special
Forces
trained with 3,600 Latin American and Caribbean troops under the
Pentagon's
Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) programme which, until the
mid-1990s,
largely escaped Congressional oversight. The training covered
tactics
ranging from air assault to sharp-shooting to riot control. <P>
In addition, both the Pentagon and the State Department appear to
be relying
increasingly on private contractors, whose activities are subject
to even
less regulation and oversight, to provide various services to
Latin American
militaries, according to the report. <P>
These include private corporations, such as Dyncorp, which
deployed more
than 100 pilots, mechanics and other support staff to conduct
spraying
operations in Colombia during 1999 at a cost of some 37 million
dollars, and
Military Professional Resources International (MPRI), a Virginia-
based firm  
of retired senior US military officers, which has trained the  
armed forces  
of key US allies, including Croatia and Nigeria on behalf of the  
Pentagon. <P>
All of these training programmes raise serious questions about  
civilian  
control, according to the authors. While the Pentagon has insisted  
in recent  
years that a primary mission of training is to teach the military  
respect  
for civilian authority, the fact of the training itself is cited  
by the  
recipient military as a ''US seal of approval'' in its dealings  
with its  
government, ''whether it is intended or not'', said Isacson. <P>
He also noted Washington's approval in principle last week of the  
600  
million dollar sale of 10-12 new F-16s to Chile as another  
disturbing sign  
of US support for Latin American militaries. Not only did the move  
break a  
25-year US ban on introducing high-performance warplanes to the  
region, but  
it also raised new questions about the power of the military. ''I  
haven't  
heard President (Ricardo) Lagos voice strong support for it,''  
noted  
Isacson. <P>
Annual US weapons sales to Latin America have generally not  
exceeded 300  
million dollars in recent years, he said. The sale, which may not  
be  
concluded for a year or two, would triple that amount and possibly  
create  
pressures on other militaries to buy new systems as well,  
according to  
Isacson. <P>
The new report also dispels a number of misconceptions about US  
training  
activities. Despite the widespread belief that Mexico and the  
United States 
had 
reduced their fast-growing military ties following disclosures  
which  
embarrassed Mexico City in 1997, the report notes that training  
activity  
remains substantially the same, and that the 73 helicopters that  
were  
returned to the US in 1999 have since been replaced by the  
purchase of 73  
Cessna aircraft. <P>
It also noted that the School of the Americas (SOA), where  
thousands of  
Latin American military officers, including dozens of notorious  
human rights  
abusers, received counter-insurgency training during the Cold War,  
will  
re-open this month under a new name, the Western Hemisphere  
Institute for  
Security Co-operation. It remains unclear whether the curriculum  
will be  
substantially changed, according to the  
report.
