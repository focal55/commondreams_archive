MADRID  - The execution of Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh Monday unleashed condemnation across Europe on
the eve of President Bush's first official visit to the
continent.
<p>European opposition to the death penalty outweighed
abhorrence at McVeigh's crime when he was put to death by
lethal injection at an Indiana prison for a 1995 blast that
gutted a federal office building and killed 168 people.
<p>Critics of capital punishment called it a barbaric,
blood-thirsty way of making McVeigh pay for his crime.
<p>``By executing the first federal death row prisoner in
nearly four decades, the USA has allowed vengeance to triumph
over justice and distanced itself yet further from the
aspirations of the international community,'' the London-based
human rights group Amnesty International said.
<p>America's penchant for the death penalty puts it ethically
at odds with its traditional European allies, which have all
banned it. The last person executed in the European Union  was
killed by guillotine in France in 1977.
<p>``The death penalty is a barbarism inappropriate to our
times,'' said Antonio Maria Pereira, president of the Portuguese
human rights group Law and Justice.
<p>CASTS SHADOW OVER BUSH VISIT
<p>Controversy surrounding McVeigh's execution could cast a
shadow over Bush's five-nation tour, which is expected to draw
street protests not only against the death penalty but also
against his policies on missile defense and global warming.
<p>Some European media have depicted Bush as a ``serial
executioner'' because of his record as governor of Texas where
152 executions took place during his nearly six years in
office.
<p>The United States and Japan are the only two rich,
industrialized democracies that still regularly put convicted
criminals to death.
<p>Many Europeans are puzzled that the United States, a
country that holds itself up as a model of democracy and human
rights, continues to carry out death sentences.
<p>McVeigh's execution had particularly strong resonance in
Spain, where Bush was due to arrive Tuesday morning on the
first stop of his European tour.
<p>Joaquin Martinez, a 30-year-old Spaniard who was convicted
and then cleared of double murder in the United States,
returned home Sunday after spending three years on Florida's
death row.
<p>Martinez's ordeal sparked public outrage in Spain, which is
still haunted by memories of thousands of summary executions
carried out during the 1939-1975 dictatorship of Generalisimo
Francisco Franco.
<p>``This doesn't solve anything. The politics aren't based on
justice,'' said Pepe Mejia, spokesman for a coalition of Spanish
groups planning protests against Bush's visit to Madrid.
<p>Unlike the Martinez case, few Europeans doubted McVeigh's
guilt in the worst terror bombing in U.S. history. But many
slammed the U.S. government for using a form of punishment that
they consider cruel and outdated.
<p>``McVeigh committed a horrible crime. What he did or why he
did it is not being discussed -- what is being discussed is the
death sentence,'' said Sergio D'Elia, secretary of a protest
group that demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy in Rome.
<p>``Bush built his race to the White House on a road paved
with those have been put to death,'' she said.
<p>Pope John Paul II had joined with human rights groups in
appealing in vain for Bush to spare McVeigh's life.
