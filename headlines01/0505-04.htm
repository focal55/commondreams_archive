LARANDIA ARMY BASE, Colombia   -- U.S. Green Beret trainers
watched proudly as Colombian troops reacted to an ''ambush'' with a
withering blast of gunfire and by hurling hand grenades.
<p>
   The aggressive response during training exercises -- opened for
the first time to journalists on Friday -- was one the U.S. Special
Forces have been instilling into their charges, who will soon
combat drug trafficking in an area swarming with rebels and
paramilitaries.<p>

</table></font>The battalion will finish its months-long training in this
sprawling jungle base on May 24, and will join two other
counternarcotics battalions -- a total of 3,000 soldiers -- that have
been trained by the Green Berets since April 1999.<p>
   Amid criticism from human rights groups and even the U.S. State
Department that Colombian security forces have a poor human rights
record, the U.S. Embassy investigated each of the 3,000 soldiers to
make sure they have not been accused of abuses or drug trafficking.<p>
   But they will likely be conducting joint anti-drug operations
with Colombian counterguerrilla battalions which have not undergone
such scrutiny -- and which have a reputation of maintaining covert
links with the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia,
which has been massacring suspected rebel collaborators.<p>
   Under a brooding gray sky, the Green Berets -- from the 7th
Special Forces Group based in Fort Bragg, N.C. -- watched their
students stealthily approach a mock drug lab manned by soldiers
pretending to be rebels and peasant farmers who were processing
coca leaves into cocaine.<p>
   The bit of Hollywood theatrics was eerie, considering that not
far from the perimeter of this huge base in southern Caqueta state
there are real coca labs guarded by rebels.<p>
   ''We are troops of the counternarcotics battalion! You are
completely surrounded,'' shouted one of the Colombian soldiers
after his squad had closed in.<p>
   A ''rebel'' clad in a dark green uniform and black rubber boots
opened fire, and was immediately cut down by the soldiers, who
rushed into the muddy clearing. A furious exchange of gunfire,
using blanks, ensued.<p>
   The U.S. trainers, clad in camouflage fatigues and wearing
floppy ''boonie'' hats, said they try to instill ''target
discrimination'' in their students, in the hope they will not blow
away noncombatants in real action.<p>
   ''That's the only thing we can do, really. When people are in
the area we're expecting them to identify them before they shoot,''
explained a trainer. ''It's not just spray -- it's identify and then
engage.''<p>
   Army Gen. Mario Montoya, the commander of Colombia's southern
region where the U.S.-trained battalions will be based, rejected
allegations by human rights groups that some army units are
fighting a dirty war against rebels.<p>
   ''If we were as bloodthirsty as people say, the war would have
been over by now -- we would have killed all the bad guys,'' Montoya
declared.<p>
   The newly trained troops will join the other two
counternarcotics battalions in operations against coca plantations
and drug labs, mostly in Putumayo and Caqueta states, which
together produce more than 60 percent of Colombia's cocaine.<p>
   The U.S backing of Colombia's military, which has been fighting
a 37-year war against rebels, has some critics suspecting the
assistance is more geared at helping wipe out the rebellion instead
of stemming drug trafficking.<p>
   Since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- the biggest
rebel group -- earns millions of dollars by protecting and taxing
drug crops, as do the rival paramilitaries, the U.S.-trained troops
will have wide clearance to launch attacks.<p>
   A U.S. military official based in Colombia, speaking on
condition of customary anonymity, said the U.S.-trained troops can
target any of the thousands of rebels and paramilitary gunmen in
Putumayo and Caqueta, because he asserted they are there only to
make money off the drug trade.<p>
   The anti-drug troops provide protection for low-flying
fumigation planes and seek out and destroy drug labs. The two
battalions have destroyed 86,000 acres of coca and killed 52
''narcotraffickers'' since December, Montoya said. He did not give
a breakdown on how many of the dead were rebels and paramilitaries.<p>
   In the clashes, one officer, three non-commissioned officers and
six privates have been slain, Montoya said.<p>
   Under the $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, 16 Blackhawk and 25
Super Huey helicopters will begin arriving in July for the
counternarcotics battalions.<p>
   They will give the battalions far greater mobility and fire
support, the U.S. military official said.<p>
   ''We'll be able to double the rate of success we're having now,
and that's a modest estimate,'' he predicted.
