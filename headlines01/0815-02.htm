            TAIPEI, TAIWAN -- This island nation has long been famed for its transformation 
            from a developing country to an industrial colossus. 
            <P>But a recent labor dispute at a Taiwanese-owned textile factory 
              in impoverished Nicaragua has cast a spotlight on what U.S. activists 
              say is Taiwan's least admired export: labor rights abuses. 
            <P>In recent years, Taiwan has set up scores of garment factories 
              in Central America to produce goods for the U.S. market. Management 
              practices at these factories often seem like they're taken from 
              the pages of a Dickens novel, activists say. 
            <P>"Taiwanese manufacturers have one of the worst reputations in the 
              world regarding the treatment of workers. They can be quite vicious," 
              said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor 
              Committee, based in New York. 
            <P>Kernaghan and others say the abuses include obligatory overtime, 
              physical violence, union busting and pregnancy tests as a condition 
              for employment. 
            <P>To be sure, Taiwanese firms are following in the footsteps of many 
              U.S.- owned maquiladoras, which also take advantage of low wages, 
              tax breaks and lax government enforcement of labor and environmental 
              laws. But U.S. factories tend to be less abusive because they are 
              under constant scrutiny by nongovernmental organizations and liberal 
              politicians at home. In Taiwan, there is little public awareness 
              of the problem. 
            <P>"There are civil society groups that are attempting to impose an 
              enforcement mechanism," said Teresa Casertano, field representative 
              for Central America for the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center in Washington, 
              D.C. "But the Taiwanese government is not sensitive to that." 
            <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is steadfast in its support 
              of its overseas investors and rejects the implication that Taiwanese 
              businesspeople have a poor labor rights record. Instead, ministry 
              officials say the nation's policy to win diplomatic support abroad 
              has only benefits. 
            <P>"(Our companies) bring much-needed jobs and economic development 
              to these countries," said spokeswoman Katherine Chang. 
            <P>In recent months, the U.S. anti-sweatshop movement has made the 
              Nien Hsing Textile Co., the world's largest manufacturer of blue 
              jeans, a cause celebre. The Taipei company has enjoyed spiraling 
              profits from its denim operations in Central America, which supply 
              the huge retail demand in the United States for cheaply produced 
              clothes. 
            <P>But a decision by Nien Hsing executives last year to fire and sue 
              union leaders at its Chentex plant in Managua who had demanded better 
              pay and working conditions attracted the attention of the National 
              Labor Committee. The NLC is renowned for exposing sweatshop conditions 
              in the Honduran factory that produced clothes for the label of television 
              personality Kathie Lee Gifford. 
            <P>Chentex workers alleged that beyond union busting, the company 
              paid subsistence wages of $60 a month, or 20 cents for every $30 
              pair of jeans delivered to such major retailers as J.C. Penney, 
              Target, Sears, Kmart and Wal- Mart as well as the U.S. armed forces, 
              which sold Chentex-made jeans in stores on military bases nationwide. 
            <P>A conflict began after workers asked for an 8-cent hourly wage 
              raise and complained about poor ventilation, limited bathroom breaks 
              and physical abuse when they didn't meet production quotas. Management 
              then fired four union leaders and 700 others affiliated with the 
              union. 
            <P>Afterward, protests erupted in the United States at college campuses, 
              and action was demanded in Congress, where Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, 
              wrote a letter to then-President Bill Clinton signed by 68 Democrats 
              asking him to order the U.S. Embassy in Managua to investigate and 
              "not be part of the sweatshop economy." 
            <P>The pressure tactics worked. Nien Hsing lost orders from its U.S. 
              buyers, and the U.S. government sent a strong warning to Nicaragua 
              to enforce labor laws that Chentex had violated or lose preferential 
              trade benefits. 
            <P>In May, Nien Hsing received a final humiliation: Nicaragua's highest 
              court demanded the immediate reinstatement of the fired employees. 
              It was the first time a Central American maquiladora had been ordered 
              to reinstate fired union workers. 
            <P>Most important, the campaign against Chentex marked the first time 
              that a Taiwanese firm had been held accountable for its actions 
              abroad, says Chen Hsin-hsing, assistant professor in labor studies 
              at the Shih Hsin University in Taipei. 
            <P>"We hope it shows our industrialists that there is a minimum standard 
              of how you treat workers," said Chen. "It is a lesson they need 
              to learn." 
            <P>Terry Collingsworth, executive director of the International Labor 
              Rights Fund in Washington, D.C., says Taiwanese management needs 
              to learn another lesson. "They bring over a paternalistic attitude 
              and tend not to speak Spanish," he said. "It's a real cultural barrier 
              in which they don't know each other." 
            <P>Chen also hopes the Chentex case will send a clear message to the 
              Taiwanese government. 
            <P>In its desperate campaign to regain admission to the United Nations 
              and resist mainland China's attempts to strip the island of international 
              recognition, successive governments have offered impoverished nations 
              such as Nicaragua millions of dollars in aid and substantial business 
              investments in return for diplomatic recognition. 
            <P>The seven Central American nations are a rare stronghold of support 
              for Taiwan and are among only 29 around the world that maintain 
              diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 
            <P>Since 1992, Taiwan has given the region more than $180 million 
              in aid, including $14 million to build Nicaragua's presidential 
              palace and its foreign ministry. 
            <P>"Development, aid, investment. It's the Holy Trinity of Taiwan 
              diplomacy," said George Nee of the Asia Pacific Labor Update, a 
              labor rights watchdog group in Taiwan. 
            <P>"After encouraging these businesses to go overseas and subsidizing 
              them to do so, the (Taiwanese) government is hardly going to turn 
              around and slap them on the hand for exploiting labor laws." 
            <P>That view is shared by Nien Hsing vice chairman John Chen, who 
              says his company remains one of the largest investors in Central 
              America -- employing more than 13,000 people in Nicaragua alone. 
              He dismissed U.S. labor activists who criticize Taiwanese as puppets 
              of those who want to protect U.S. business interests. 
            <P>"They spread vicious lies and rumors about Taiwan's offshore manufacturers 
              in an attempt to protect American-made goods," he said. "That is 
              their motivation." 
            <P>But some Taiwanese politicians disagree. 
            <P>Independent legislator Shih Ming-teh, a senior member on the parliamentary 
              committee for foreign affairs, is organizing a hearing next month 
              to rally support for legislation that would hold companies more 
              accountable for labor abuses committed locally and abroad. 
            <P>He says Taiwan will pay dearly for ignoring a call-to-arms from 
              Western critics who perceive the globalized economy as unfettered 
              exploitation of developing countries. 
            <P>"In the long run, this will shame Taiwan's international image 
              and will cause a lot of trouble," he said. "This is not an issue 
              that will go away. It's time to take action or pay the price."
