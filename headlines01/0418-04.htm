ATLANTA, Ga.  -- Spearheading a trend that could forever
change law enforcement, engineers are developing tools that use novel forms
of radar to see through walls and doors and detect the presence of living
beings.

<p>The tools are designed to decrease risks incurred by police who must enter
premises to flush out suspects.

</table>The devices have netted the interest of law enforcement and the ire of
some civil rights advocates. And one of them, which uses a new and
controversial type of radar wave known as ultra-wide band or UWB, must face
the scrutiny of Federal Communications Commission regulators.

<p>"We hope to have our device commercialized in about a year," said Gene
Greneker, a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in
Atlanta who is developing a device dubbed the Radar Flashlight.

<p>Funded by the National Institute of Justice, a division of the Department
of Justice, Greneker's flashlight uses a 16-degree radar beam and a
customized signal processor to identify human presence through partitions up
to 8 inches thick.

<p>The device, which can detect respiration and tiny movements, was
originally designed by the military for paramedics to check remotely the
vital signs of solider wounded in heated conflict zones.

<p>Greneker said the current version, which is under modification, has a
pistol-grip handle and automatically tells the user how close it must be to
a wall to get a reading. It then shoots out electromagnetic energy, finds
the return signal, reads it and display the results on a panel. As the
person on the other side breaths, the display reflects the movements.

<p>Greneker is tweaking the gun so that it can be placed on a tripod twenty
feet from a wall and be operated by remote control.

<p>Once commercialized, Greneker said the device should sell for $1,000 to
$1,500 per device.

<p>"Police departments need affordable tools," he said.

<p>"The National Institute of Justice is putting what few dollars it has into
technologies they hope will save lives,'" said Bill Deck of the National Law
Enforcement Corrections Technology Center, a nation-wide non-profit group
that promotes technological tools for police. "They are making these types
of devices a priority because they want to give officers some sort of
advanced warning."

<p>Time Domain, a company based in Huntsville, Ala., has created a similar
device called the RV2000. The system uses so-called ultra-wideband radar
that works by shooting out short bursts of energy -- 5 million per second --
that are capable of moving unhampered through most materials including
reinforced concrete and wood. Based on the movement of the energy, the
device can spot a person at a distance of less than 10 feet.

<p>But critics of ultra-wide band, which is a much sought-after technology by
many communications companies, claim it interferes with transmissions of the
Global Positioning System. The FCC is currently considering its position on
UWB technologies but in 1999 gave Time Domain a waiver to sell 2,500 radar
devices to police for testing.

<p>The company provided a limited number of police departments with a
prototype and has received positive responses, Glenn Morris, Time Domain's
director of radar operators, told United Press International in a telephone
interview. Morris said the device has also proven capable of detecting the
slightest movements of earthquake victims buried 11 feet under rubble.

<p>"This is yet another example of the way in which technology gives law
enforcement super human powers," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director
of the American Civil Liberties Union. "That requires us to reexamine under
what standards law enforcement can search us. We think uses of this kind
should be based on a warrant and probable cause that someone committed a
crime."

<p>He said such devices are just one in a host of technologies being used by
law enforcement from thermal imaging to video cameras to low dose X-rays.

<p>"It all amounts to a high-tech strip search," he said.

<p>Defense contractor Raytheon is reportedly developing a similar system
capable of spotting a fugitive from 100 feet away.
