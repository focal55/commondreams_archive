The gender gap is not just a feature of business, law and medicine. In the nonprofit sector, too, women earn significantly less than their male counterparts, according to a new study based on the fiscal 1998 and 1999 tax forms of 75,000 public charities. 
<P> The study by GuideStar, a national database on nonprofit organizations, found that the median pay of female chief executives at the largest nonprofit organizations was $170,180 a year, compared with $264,602 for male chief executives. A similar gap existed at smaller organizations. </P>
<P> "When we first started doing this, I had several people tell me that what we were going to find is that women dominate the nonprofit world," said Chuck McLean, research vice president at GuideStar. "There's some feeling out there that the profit world is masculine, and the nonprofit world is a gentler service world, a female world. I think people at the nonprofits will be surprised by this gap." </P>
<P> Indeed, women were found to earn less than men in the top positions in every job category at the nonprofit sector: development, administration, education, program, marketing, business, operations, public relations, technology, finance and law. </P>
<P> There were narrow exceptions in a few categories. Among nonprofit groups with budgets of more than $50 million a year, women in the top development job earned a median salary of $136,105 annually, compared with $127,985 for men. At smaller organizations, though, men in that job earned more than women. </P>
<P> Some pay gaps were huge. Men earned about twice as much as women in the top legal job at organizations with annual budgets under $250,000. And men earned about 40 percent more than women in the top education jobs at the largest and smallest organizations. </P>
<P> The pay gap is not the only indicator of women's lesser status in the nonprofit world. While women are the chief executives at a majority of the smallest nonprofit organizations — those with budgets of $500,000 or less a year — the study found that men fill 76 percent of the top jobs at organizations with annual budgets of more than $5 million and 88 percent of those jobs at organizations with budgets of more than $50 million. </P>
<P> Over all, larger nonprofit organizations pay more than smaller ones. But pay scales also depend on the field in which the organizations work, the study found. </P>
<P> Research hospitals, scientific institutes and research groups pay the highest salaries, while human services groups, housing groups, animal- protection charities and hunger-prevention groups pay the lowest. </P>
