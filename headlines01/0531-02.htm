New glimpses of Earth from space show air pollution wrapping around
the planet, spreading haze and hazardous gases across oceans and
continents and posing new challenges for cleanup.
<p>The findings, beamed back to Earth from a NASA satellite in orbit for
two years, depict in dramatic fashion the global reach of air pollution.
Scientists have known for years that man-made pollutants spread far and
wide, but this is the first time they have watched it happen from space
over a long period.
<p>"Much of the air pollution that humans generate comes from natural
sources, such as large fires that travel great distances and affect areas
far from the source," said John Gille, principal investigator at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. "With these new
observations, you clearly see that air pollution is much more than a
local problem. It's a global issue."
<p>The findings were presented at a scientific conference in Boston on
Wednesday. Researchers from the United States and Canada are
participating in the project, one of several ongoing studies of global
air pollution.
<b><br>
<p>Emissions Influence World's Climate
</b>
<p>Increasingly, researchers are discovering air pollution is not a
transient phenomenon, here today and gone tomorrow. Emissions climb high
into the atmosphere, borne on trade winds that circumnavigate the globe.
<p>"We are talking about someone squirting hair spray in the morning in
Los Angeles, but by the end of the day it may be reaching someone in
South America or beyond," said UC Irvine chemist Donald Blake, who has
collaborated with the researchers on a related study. "It's a whole new
way of thinking global. Everybody is downwind of something."
<p>Smoke and dust in the sky can dramatically influence climate on Earth.
Some pollutants, including soot, nitrates and sulfates from fossil-fuel
burning, coat the planet in a fine, aerosol haze. Scientists say too many
particles floating around can reflect sunlight, impair crop production in
certain places and contribute to cooler temperatures in some places.
<p>Conversely, diesel soot and carbon dioxide are powerful greenhouse
gases. They shroud the planet like a blanket, preventing heat from
escaping Earth and increasing world temperatures. Those emissions are
likely to increase as experts say worldwide fossil fuel consumption is
expected to grow by 60% over the next 20 years.
<p>Cleaning up global smog will not be easy. Blame falls on industrial
and developing nations alike. Although the United States has some of the
world's most stringent pollution control laws, those controls do not
apply abroad. International cooperation, similar to the agreement between
Canada and the United States to reduce acid rain emissions, will be
required.
<p>Michael Kenny, executive officer for the California Air Resources
Board, said one strategy is to seek international standards for vehicles
and power plants. He said multinational corporations that manufacture
those and other products need to take a leadership role. Environmental
groups and other nongovernmental organizations also need to address the
matter.
<p>"It means what we have to do is look at this more globally. It's going
to be very difficult. This is going to have to be addressed on a global
scale," Kenny said.
<p>Scientists have long known that air pollutants cover vast distances.
Desert dust storms in the Sahara deposit sand in the Caribbean, and Gobi
Desert sand has blown to North America. Volcanic ash from the 1980 Mt.
St. Helens eruption drifted for hundreds of miles. And the meltdown of
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union spread
radionuclides all over the world.
<p>But the new findings show how human activity, from forest clearing in
the tropics to fuel combustion in the industrialized world, can
accumulate into giant plumes of gases that span continents and oceans.
<p>Among the most dramatic findings are immense clouds of carbon monoxide
gas blowing across the southern Pacific Ocean from grassland and forest
fires in Africa and South America from March to December of last year.
The smoke plumes slowly traveled across the Southern Hemisphere more than
6,000 miles to Australia.
<p>In addition, heavy pulses of carbon monoxide, emanating from Asia,
Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, stretch across the Pacific,
all the way to California and other parts of the North American
continent. On the ground, researchers have measured the arrival of
intercontinental drift of chemicals from the Olympic Peninsula in
Washington state to the Bay Area.
<p>Last year, scientists noticed extensive air pollution generated by
forest fires in the American West, although most of the emissions
originating in the United States are from fossil-fuel burning for heating
and transportation.
<p>Carbon monoxide concentrations reach as much as 150 parts per billion
in the air over the Northern Hemisphere, more than double the levels
found in the Southern Hemisphere. Humans produce about half the emissions
of carbon monoxide, which is a long-lived poisonous gas and an indicator
of the presence of other gaseous pollutants.
<b><br>
<p>Pollution Diluted as It Floats From Source
</b>
<p>The health consequences for people living far downwind of air
pollution are uncertain. The farther pollutants are transported, and the
higher they float in the sky, the more diluted they become. Carbon
monoxide levels present in smoke plumes over the Northern Hemisphere are
well within health-based standards set by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. And typically the most unhealthful air pollution
occurs near its sources, from motor vehicles to indoor paints and
chemicals.
<p>"It's an open question as to how much it affects air quality in the
United States," said Richard Turco, director of the Institute of the
Environment at UCLA. "The pollution would have to be transported downward
before it can affect U.S. cities, because the pollutants are usually
transported high in the atmosphere."
<p>With the help of the satellite, which circles the Earth 15 times daily
aboard NASA's Terra spacecraft, scientists are able to see where air
pollution originates, how far it spreads and when it is released. That
data is critical to developing strategies to predict air pollution and
develop countermeasures to protect public health, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency officials said.
<p>"Such information will help us improve our understanding of the
linkages between air pollution and global climate change, and it will
likely play a pivotal role in the development of international
environmental policy," said atmospheric chemist Daniel Jacob of Harvard
University, who participated in the study.
