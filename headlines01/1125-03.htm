            The Green party backed the planned deployment of German troops in 
            the US-led war on terrorism, preventing the collapse of the center-left 
            government.

            </font>A clear majority of delegates at the party congress in this 
            northern German city voted for a declaration that "accepts" a vote 
            by parliament earlier this month to send up to 3,900 German troops 
            to aid the campaign in Afghanistan.
<p>The measure also explicitly supports the continuation of the ruling 
              coalition.</p>
            <p>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of the Social Democrats and leaders 
              of the Greens, junior partners in the ruling coalition, had warned 
              that a vote rejecting the deployment would bring about the end of 
              the government and new elections.</p>
            <p>The vote came after a nearly 11-hour heated debate devoted to the 
              war in Afghanistan and the Greens' identity as a party in government.</p>
            <p>The decision to offer German troops for the operation is heavily 
              disputed within the party, born out of the pacifist and environmentalist 
              movements of the 1970s.</p>
            <p>The declaration stopped short of the promise made by Schroeder 
              and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the Greens of "unlimited 
              solidarity" with the United States following the terrorist assault 
              of September 11, calling rather for "critical solidarity".</p>
            <p>Schroeder had put extraordinary pressure on the party to back the 
              deployment to maintain Germany's image as a trusted partner abroad.</p>
            <p>Fischer, the leftist party's unofficial leader and most prominent 
              member, told delegates that the events of September 11 had changed 
              the world and with it, transformed German foreign policy.</p>
            <p>He said the Greens were faced with a stark choice: accept new international 
              responsibilities as a result of the attacks or withdraw from government.</p>
            <p>"What we cannot do is say we are going to stay in this coalition 
              but reject this policy," Fischer said.</p>
            <p>Fischer's ultimatum, delivered in a tone ranging from paternal 
              to exasperated, marked a final attempt to convince pacifist party 
              delegates to abandon what he called positions that did nothing to 
              foster peace.</p>
            <p>"With all the frustration, I ask for your trust. I want you to 
              support my policies and not leave me standing alone."</p>
            <p>Fischer, himself a former leftist street fighter, was frequently 
              interrupted by hecklers and greeted after the 30-minute speech with 
              an even mix of cheers and boos from delegates.</p>
            <p>Pacifist delegates warned that the party was compromising its principles 
              by giving its blessing to the war, which they warned would only 
              create new civilian victims and a new breed of terrorists.</p>
            <p>"I do not want the condition for serving in government to be the 
              ability to wage war," said Greens member of parliament Steffi Lemke.</p>
            <p>Party leader Claudia Roth said she saw it as the Greens' obligation 
              to shape foreign policy focused on humanitarian and diplomatic principles. 
            </p>
            <p>She viewed it as a coup for Fischer and the Greens that the UN 
              conference on the political future of Afghanistan beginning next 
              week will be held in the former German capital of Bonn.</p>
            <p>The prospect of Germany deploying troops outside Europe for the 
              first time since World War II has threatened to deepen the cleft 
              between the Greens leadership and the party rank-and-file.</p>
            <p>The debate comes at a time in which Greens membership has declined 
              10 percent since the last general election in 1998 and less than 
              one year before the next federal poll in September 2002.</p>
            <p>The Greens are also to debate campaign strategy for the general 
              election, policy in the poorer former communist states of eastern 
              Germany, and the effects of globalization. The congress runs through 
              Sunday afternoon.</p>
