            Reducing air pollution in just four of the world's largest cities--New 
            York; Mexico City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Santiago, Chile--could prevent 
            64,000 premature deaths and 37 million lost workdays over the next 
            two decades, according to research that examines the health effects 
            of the use of fossil fuels.<BR>

                  of burning fossil fuels, a study appearing Friday, Aug. 17, 
                  2001 in the journal Science, finds no question that air pollution 
                  from exhaust pipes and smoke stacks already is killing people 
                  worldwide. In the study, researchers examined the health effects 
                  of pollution from fossil-fuels on the rate of death in four 
                  cities - Sao Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City, Santiago, Chile; and

</table></font>Worldwide, the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels leads to 
            pollution that can result in elevated rates of infant mortality, asthma, 
            cardiovascular problems and respiratory ailments and could cause millions 
            of avoidable deaths worldwide over two decades, according to the new 
            work, which reviewed more than 1,000 scientific studies.<BR>
            <BR>
            The review is published in the current issue of Science. Worldwide 
            use of fossil fuels has been a major topic of debate in recent years 
            because of long-term concerns about global warming. Many scientists 
            believe that an increased amount of carbon dioxide--produced whenever 
            coal, oil or natural gas is burned--is the chief factor in the "greenhouse 
            effect" warming of the Earth's climate. If so, reducing use of such 
            fuels is vital, experts on global warming argue.<BR>
            <BR>
            Also, "the benefits of lowering emissions are immediate" because many 
            of the gases emitted when fuels are burned are also pollutants, said 
            George Thurston, one of the review's authors and an associate professor 
            of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine.<BR>
            <BR>
            "Universal studies have shown when air pollution levels go up, you 
            get an increase in the numbers of deaths and hospital admissions, 
            missed days at work and school, and other adverse effects," Thurston 
            said.<BR>
            <BR>
            Much of the discussion on climate is about what will happen 50years 
            from now, said Devra Davis, the review's lead author and a visiting 
            professor in public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's H. John 
            Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management.<BR>
            <BR>
            "This review talks about what is going to happen tomorrow," she said.<BR>
            <BR>
            In addition to the study about pollution in the four cities, another 
            study examined in the review suggested that reducing emissions from 
            coal-fired power plants in the United States would save as many as 
            18,700 lives by reducing deaths from bronchial problems, heart disease 
            and other ailments.<BR>
            <BR>
            A third study indicated that air pollution from traffic causes more 
            deaths than do traffic accidents.<BR>
            <BR>
            A fourth study reported that alternative transportation policies initiated 
            during the busy 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta not only reduced vehicle 
            exhaust and air pollutants such as ozone by about 30%, they also decreased 
            the number of acute asthma attacks by 40% and pediatric emergency 
            admissions by about 19%.<BR>
            <BR>
            Some policy experts disagreed with the review's suggestions.<BR>
            <BR>
            The idea of reducing the use of fossil fuels to improve health is 
            "twisted science," said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy 
            at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.<BR>
            <BR>
            Decreasing the use of cheap fossil fuels would result in higher energy 
            prices and lower public access to energy, he said. That, in turn, 
            could have a "huge impact on human health," particularly in poor countries, 
            Ebell said.<BR>
            <BR>
            Others, however, praised the work.<BR>
            <BR>
            "I think this is a very important paper that makes a very significant 
            contribution to understanding damage of greenhouse gas emission on 
            our future," said Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center 
            for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School.
