PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil  -  Jose Bove, the anti-globalisation activist who has been given an ultimatium to leave Brazil, revels in controversy.
<p>Already under threat of a prison sentence for his part in ransacking a McDonald's fast food outlet in his native France, Bove is a determined campaigner who refuses to compromise his firmly-held principles.</p><p><TABLE Border=0 align=right hspace=5 Cellpadding=6 width="300">

This time he is in hot water for leading an invasion by 1,300 Brazilian farmers of plantations run by US biotechnology firm Monsanto. They uprooted genetically-modified corn and soya bean plants, burned seeds and destroyed documents in the company's offices.
<p>His initiative at an anti-globalisation forum here -- an alternative to the annual gathering of the world's political and business elite taking place in Davos, Switzerland -- was another publicity-seeking success.</p><p>Bove, 47, has become an instantly recognisable figure, with his extravagant moustache and pipe-smoking habit, popping up wherever there is an ecological axe to be ground.</p><p>He has travelled the world lecturing anyone who will listen on the evils of globalisation and genetically-modifed crops and has earned the nickname 'Asterix' -- after a French comic strip character -- for his determination to repel alien invaders in the form of foreign capitalist concerns.</p><p>A sheep-farmer and producer of the celebrated Roquefort cheese, he has become the standard-bearer of the fight against new economic and gastronomic imperialism.</p><p>His appearances at anti-globalisation gatherings in Seattle and Davos shot him to fame and his conviction for the trashing of a McDonald's fast-food restaurant in his home town of Millau served only to reinforce his reputation as a swashbuckling resistance hero.</p><p>A crowd of 30,000 turned out in Millau to support Bove when he and nine colleagues from his radical farmers' union, the Peasant Confederation, went on trial over the McDonald's escapade.</p><p>Popular French singer Francis Cabrel has described Bove as "one of the last courageous, natural, honest voices left in a world where the rest are tarnished by compromise."</p><p>Ironically, for a man who epitomises the virtues of the traditional French son-of-the-soil, Bove speaks faultless English, learned when his bourgeois parents spent four years in the United States.</p><p><TABLE Border=0 align=right hspace=5 Cellpadding=6 width="300">

His story is typical of many of the 1968 generation of French students who rose up against middle class conservatism, turning his back on the city in search of a simpler life on the land.
<p>In the 1970s he and his wife Alice were among the leaders of a successful campaign to defend the starkly beautiful Larzac plateau outside Millau against plans to extend a military camp there.</p><p>In 1987, he helped set up the Peasant Confederation, whose aim has been to champion the cause of small producers against the interests of big business and agricultural barons.</p><p>With his honed sense of publicity Bove once organised the ploughing of the park under the Eiffel Tower in the centre of Paris to protest EU farm policies.</p><p>In 1995 he was aboard the ship Rainbow Warrior in the south Pacific to protest France's resumption of nuclear tests. Three years later he was convicted for destroying a consignment of genetically-modified maize.</p><p>But it took the shock-tactics of an act of criminal damage against McDonald's to propel him into the public eye.</p><p>Bove enjoys broad public support. Criticism of America comes easy in France and most French people believe the cause of small farmers is just. </p><p>Both Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac have felt it worth their while to hear Bove's views at first hand.</p>
