Ultra-right-wing organizations - including a particular West Coast group - have become a key focus of the massive federal investigation into the murderous Anthrax attacks, The Post has learned.
<P>
<P>Investigators have been zeroing in on members of several anti-government hate groups that they believe have obtained or attempted to get the deadly bacteria from several U.S.-based laboratories before it surfaced in Florida, Washington and New York this month.
<P>
<P>Several sources told The Post that, while they have not entirely discounted state-sponsored terrorism, Osama bin Laden sympathizers or sleeper cells, a number of developments in the far-flung probe have them eyeing domestic terrorists:
<P>
<P>* The FBI is analyzing about a dozen other letters - including several that predate the World Trade Center attacks and the anthrax scare - that were sent to various media outlets. These letters did not contain anthrax, but had similar messages and handwriting as the germ-tainted notes.
<P>
<P>* Probers also see similarities between the anthrax letters and some of the so-called hoax letters that contained talcum powder and were initially brushed aside as not being linked to the bioterror scare.
<P>
<P>Some investigators believe the same person may have written both sets of letter.
<P>
<P>"Our feeling is the anthrax does not point to an international terrorist group," a well-placed source said. "The only way it could be is if they are purposely writing letters that point away from them as a ruse and using anthrax that we believe was manufactured here."
<P>"The anthrax letter writer did not fall off a turnip truck after the World Trade Center destruction," another source said. "He has been thinking these thoughts long before this, and may have had anthrax for a while."
<P>"There are a number of strong leads and some people we've known of for some time who are being looked at," another highly placed source said.
<P>From the start, FBI profilers cautioned about channeling investigative efforts toward Mideast terror groups because the anthrax-tainted letters to the New York Post, NBC-TV and Sen. Thomas Daschle contained the date "09-11-01," but were in envelopes postmarked Sept. 18.
<P>Sources said international terrorists would unlikely feel the need to spell out an obvious link to their earlier horrific handiwork.
<P>"That's real overkill," agreed Clint Van Zandt, a former top FBI profiler. "It is someone other than a bin Laden trying too hard to link up to Sept. 11. It is a gratuitous reference."
<P>The tone of the letter to Daschle, the Senate majority leader, is far more threatening - "You Die Now" - than the missives to the media, which advised the recipients to "Take Penacilin [sic]."
<P>"Daschle represents the government, and the government is what the right-wing groups hate," a source said. "By contrast, the media is something they use to get publicity and spread fear."
<P>The sources declined to name the hate groups being eyed in the investigation or the laboratories where the anthrax may have been obtained or milled.
