LONDON &#150;&#150;  As George W. Bush takes his first big turn on the global stage, the outside world is proving itself a tough audience.
<p>
Bush's inauguration as America's 43rd president on Saturday drew the customary expressions of good will and good wishes from world leaders &#150; but in most countries, news coverage of the event ranged from indifferent to sharply critical.
<p>
Around the world, much of the commentary in Sunday's newspapers centered on the new president's perceived lack of experience in foreign affairs. The Taipei Times, an English-language daily, quipped that the new president's "knowledge of the world has been shown to be, shall we say, modest."
<p>
In Britain, traditionally the closest U.S. ally, some observers suggested Bush's presidency would do little to bring America closer to Europe &#150; or the rest of the world.
<p>
"The day George W. Bush was sworn in, the Atlantic doubled in width," said an opinion piece in the respected Observer newspaper.
<p>
The paper's lead editorial, focusing on what it described as the deeply held conservatism of some key White House appointees, was headlined: "Beware Bush's American Dream &#150; This President Is Not To Be Trusted."
<p>
As far as many overseas were concerned, Bush will have to work hard to emerge from the shadow of his father, former President George Bush. Writing in Britain's Independent newspaper, author Will Self referred to him as "boy George," and the dynastic theme was heavily emphasized in coverage elsewhere as well.
<p>
"George W. Bush Inherits the White House," said France's weekly Le Journal du Dimanche, illustrating the story with a photo of Bush kissing his mother, Barbara, on the cheek, his arm around his father.
<p>
Le Journal du Dimanche's editorial expressed concern that the new Republican White House could usher in an era of withdrawal from world affairs &#150; as symbolized in particular by the national missile defense system Bush favors.
<p>
"It is not healthy that a great world power renounces participation in world affairs," it said. "The world has nothing to gain from the isolationism of the United States."
<p>
After weeks of intensive worldwide coverage of America's drawn-out electoral battle, some news outlets appeared to be suffering from Bush fatigue. In Russia, ORT television, the only channel seen throughout the country, did not even mention the inauguration in Sunday night's newscast.
<p>
Britain's more serious newspapers all played the inauguration on Page One, but its tabloids instead favored the saga of U.S.-born twins adopted over the Internet and seized by social workers from their prospective British parents.
<p>
In many commentaries, the lack of a clear-cut electoral mandate was a much-emphasized theme.
<p>
"Seldom in the past has the arrival of a new president in the White House been accompanied by so many questions as those hanging today over George Bush," Greece's Kathimerini newspaper said.
<p>
Still, some were optimistic about Bush's ascendancy.
<p>
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said in remarks published Sunday that his country will respond if Bush takes steps to rebuild relations. Hamid Reza Asefi said there was a "good opportunity" for improved ties with the United States under Bush.
<p>
In both Israel and the Palestinian lands, there have been repeated expressions of concern in recent weeks about Bush's expected low level of involvement in the Mideast peace process, in contrast to former President Clinton's deep personal involvement. Coverage of the inauguration, however, was largely brisk and straightforward.
<p>
In Asia, South Korean officials said they expected the Bush administration largely to stay the course of engagement with North Korea. But they were uneasy because the GOP has traditionally been tougher than the Democrats on the North's Stalinist regime.
<p>
The Bush administration "should not pour cold water on the thawing of the Korean peninsula by excessively pushing the North, which has just begun to open its door," South Korean daily newspaper Kyunghyang said in an editorial.
<p>
In Taiwan, there was hope that Bush will be more willing than Clinton to provide military assistance, because the GOP is perceived as favoring the island's interests over those of rival China.
<p>
But The Taipei Times newspaper worried that the new leader would be too influenced by his father, who was thought to have taken a lax stance toward Beijing after its 1989 crackdown on student protesters in Tiananmen Square.
<p>
In Africa, analysts and government officials have expressed fears that the region will be far from a top priority. Sean Jacobs, an analyst at the Institute for Democracy in South Africa, said Sunday that it was clear the new administration intended to adopt a far more hands-off approach.
<p>
For example, he said, Bush's team was "showing no interest in getting involved to solve the crisis" sparked by the assassination of Congo's Laurent Kabila.
