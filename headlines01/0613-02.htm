BRUSSELS, Belgium   - Police detained 30 people Wednesday in
a day of protests against President Bush's visit that included a
parachutist with a ''Stop Star Wars'' banner and activists trying
to block his motorcade from entering an airport.<p>

Policemen arrest Greenpeace activists who chained themselves in front of the Melsbroek airport to protest against U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to Brussels, June 13, 2001. President Bush will take part in a North-Atlantic Council at NATO headquarters, as part of his first European tour, and later this week will try to calm European anger over his rejection of the Kyoto agreement on global warming at his first EU-U.S. summit in Gothenburg.

</table></font></font>Two dozen Greenpeace environmental activists chained themselves
together to block a side exit at the military airfield where Bush
arrived from Spain early Wednesday for a NATO summit. His motorcade
left Melsbroek Airport by another exit half a mile away, out of
sight of the demonstrators.<p>
   People on either end were chained to traffic lights and held a
banner reading ''George W. Bush -- Wanted for crimes against the
planet,'' as a loud siren wailed. Dozens of protesters were
handcuffed and taken away.<p>
   Several hundred protesters also gathered close NATO headquarters
decrying Bush's plans for a missile defense shield and his
rejection of the Kyoto global warming agreement. Police estimated
the group at 400 and detained at least two more people there.<p>
   The demonstrators booed and blew whistles as the delegations
arrived for the summit with Bush, with some carrying banners such
as ''Save the climate,'' ''Stop Star Wars'' and ''Death penalty
equals murder.''<p>
   A German Greenpeace activist tried to steer his motor driven
parachute over NATO headquarters and was arrested when he landed
nearby.<p>
   Dan Hindsgaul, a spokesman for the Greenpeace demonstrators,
said they wanted to make their opposition to the Bush policies
heard. ''It's a symbolic action showing he's not welcome,'' he
said, adding that it was the first in a series of protests planned
during Bush's weeklong European trip.<p>
   Hindsgaul said activists from across Europe hoped to pressure
the European leaders not to allow the United States to use key
radar facilities in Britain and Greenland for the missile defense
project.<p>
   In Norway, Greenpeace activists on Wednesday ended an eight-hour
occupation of a U.S.-bound oil tanker rather than face police
action, according to media reports.<p>
   About 10 activists had boarded the Greek-registered supertanker
Cosmic at a Norwegian refinery to protest Bush's environmental
policies.<p>
   Police had ordered the activists to leave for safety reasons and
the group reportedly withdrew because they feared their boats and
other equipment might be seized.About two dozen environmental activists
chained themselves together to block a side exit at the military
airfield where President Bush  arrived for a NATO  summit Wednesday.
<p>Bush's motorcade left Melsbroek Airport by the main exit half a
mile away, out of sight of the demonstration.
<p>One demonstrator was detained by police when he tried to chain
himself to an airport fence.
