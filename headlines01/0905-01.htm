Delegates from several Bay Area organizations say they are dismayed by 
the U.S. decision to withdraw from the U.N. World Conference Against Racism in 
Durban, South Africa, but they remain undaunted.
<P>"What is most disappointing is that the U.S. government refused to 
participate based on the very principles that (America) was built on, and that 
is freedom of expression," said Krishanti Dharmaraj, executive director of the 
Women's Institute for Leadership Development in San Francisco, speaking from 
the Durban apartment where she and 35 other group delegates are staying.
<P>"What the U.S. government refused to acknowledge is that people have the 
right to disagree . . . and instead it is just giving up," Dharmaraj said. 
"And that is disappointing as a U.S. citizen."
<P>Few were surprised by the decision, given the government's repeated 
warnings in the weeks leading up to the event, said Steve Williams, executive 
director of San Francisco's People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER), 
which sent two representatives.
<P>"In some sense, the U.S. leaving is creating space for people to have a 
substantive discussion about what racism looks like, instead of trying to 
fight with them about language," Williams said from his San Francisco office. 
"For the folks going from POWER, our objective was to make connections and 
link up with other activists across the globe -- and the U.S. pulling out 
doesn't have too much of an impact on that."
<P>Wilson Riles, San Francisco regional director of the American Friends 
Service Committee, called the decision "shameful and immature," adding that 
many delegates -- including about 40 from his organization -- suspect the 
government is trying to deflect attention from its own race problems.
<P>"I think a lot of the talk about Israel is camouflage for the government 
not wanting to talk about reparations for slavery," said Riles.
<P>For most, however, no amount of high-level political maneuvering can cast a 
pall over the personal experience of being there.
<P>"They are excited to meet all kinds of different people from around the 
world who are dealing with some of the similar issues that women of color are 
dealing with here," said Miriam Louie of the Women of Color Resource Center in 
Berkeley, referring to the two dozen delegates the group sent to Durban.
<P>Despite some frustration over the U.S.-Israeli withdrawal, Dharmaraj said 
most attendees are focused on the fight against racism.
<P>"We are keeping in mind that this is a struggle, and the struggle will 
continue," she said yesterday. "Durban is only one stop in that journey, and 
our spirits are high to continue that work, and the U.S. government will not 
stop the work happening."
