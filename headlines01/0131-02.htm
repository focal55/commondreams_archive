The crisis at Pacifica radio took a dramatic turn this morning during the live national broadcast of <a href="http://democracynow.org/">Democracy Now!</a>
<p>
Juan Gonzalez, longtime co-host of the networks most successful program, opened today's show by delivering a scathing attack on the Pacifica Radio Network's board of directors and management. Breaking the network's 'Gag Rule', Gonzalez urged listeners to take back Pacifica Radio from &quot;a small clique that
has more in common with corporate vultures than with working-class
Americans&quot;. He complained of 'unprecedented attacks' on co-host Amy Goodman and resigned 'effective immediately.'
<p>Gonzalez pledged to  devote his 
energies to a massive  campaign which will include a 
nationwide boycott of donations to Pacifica until the board resigns or is removed, and a diversion of those funds to the 
legal and activist efforts throughout the nation to fight the takeover.
Listeners wishing to join the campaign should call 212-871-9322, or
e-mail: <a href="mailto:pacificacampaign@yahoo.com">pacificacampaign@yahoo.com</a>.
<p>Co-host Amy Goodman emotionally thanked Gonzalez before switching to a taped program.
<p>Democracy Now! was censored today over the Pacifica station in Washington DC -  WPFW - about a minute into Juan's resignation. The rest of the show was kept off the air.

<p><b>Transcript of Today's Democracy Now!
</b>
<p>0905am, 31 Jan 01

<p>AMY GOODMAN: ... chimes of freedom. And you're listening to 
Pacifica Radio's Democracy Now. I'm Amy Goodman, here with 
Juan Gonzalez.  

<p>JUAN GONZALEZ: Good day, Amy and to our listeners around the 
country. And Amy, do you realize the anniversary that we're 
approaching, in the next few days? It will be five years since 
Democracy Now came on the air, since you and I started working 
in February of 1996 to produce the first of these shows. And, I have 
an important announcement for folks, and I'd like to urge all of our 
loyal listeners to Democracy Now and to Pacifica across the 
country to get a pencil and paper because I've got some important 
information that has to deal with both the anniversary of Democracy 
Now as well as the upcoming fund drive of Pacifica.

<p>I want to give you some numbers. First, there's a phone number 
that you need to write down. It's (212) 871-9322. That's (212) 871-
9322. And then there's an email address that I want you all to take 
down. That is <a href="mailto:pacificacampaign@yahoo.com">pacificacampaign@yahoo.com</a>. Again, that's 
<a href="mailto:pacificacampaign@yahoo.com">pacificacampaign@yahoo.com</a>. 

<p>Now, Amy, you know we've been working together for five years 
now, and I have to tell you, since the show's inception, I've been 
very proud of the ground-breaking work that we've done on 
Democracy Now, and also, more importantly, as a long-time 
listener for more than 30 years to Pacifica Radio programs, I 
understand the critical role the network has played in reporting 
important stories the corporate media ignored, thus helping to 
shape a lot of the progressive thoughts and popular movements in 
the country. 

<p>But, unfortunately, I am resigning today, effective immediately, from 
Democracy Now, because I've decided that the current 
management situation at Pacifica has become intolerable and 
despite my hope that the majority of the Pacifica Foundation's 
Board of Directors would come to its senses, the situation has only 
gotten worse, the last straw being the Christmas Coup at this 
station, WBAI, last month. 

<p>Quite simply, I've come to the conclusion that the Pacifica Board 
has been hijacked by a small clique that has more in common with 
modern-day corporate vultures than with working-class America. 
That clique has illegally changed the foundation's bylaws and, 
during the past two years it has methodically sought to squash 
dissent throughout the network, first at KPFA, then at PNN News, 
then at Democracy Now, and now at WBAI. 

<p>This group does not respect free speech. It does not respect labor 
or civil rights. It doesn't even practice due process for its own 
managers. And it's now seeking to radically alter Pacifica's bylaws 
to pave the way for the selling of one or more stations. Finally, 
Amy, I've got to tell you that the consistent attacks on you, the 
most important public face at Pacifica, have so poisoned the 
atmosphere at the network that it's becoming increasingly difficult 
for many people of conscience to continue working here. 

<p>And, Amy, you're a wonderful and committed journalist, you've 
been subjected to slanderous personal accusations and constant 
undermining of your efforts. And the board of Pacifica has tolerated, 
and I think even encouraged this, and it's hypocritical of the board 
to claim in its taped statements that it fully supports Amy 
Goodman when key managers routinely make your life miserable

<p>This clique on the board insults Pacifica's loyal and sophisticated 
listeners by asking them to finance its shenanigans with their 
donations. 

<p>Therefore, starting today, I will be joining other Pacifica listeners in 
a national corporate campaign that will not rest until every board 
member who has orchestrated this hijacking resigns and a new 
board is in place, a board that is democratically accountable to the 
network's listeners, to the communities of the stations of Pacifica, 
and to its staff. Our campaign is calling for listeners across the 
country to withhold donations to Pacifica in a mass referendum 
against the board's policies. 

<p>Instead, we will be urging the listeners to contribute their money to 
a variety of groups across the country that are battling the Pacifica 
board, including the legal fund for court suits which are currently 
challenging the board's legitimacy. 

<p>Mr. Murdock, Mr. Accosta, Mr. Palmer, and the other clique on the 
board will soon find out that Pacifica is listener-sponsored 
community radio and I am sorry to have to take this kind of action, 
but, and I fully support you in continuing to keep Democracy Now 
alive as long as possible under these trying circumstances, Amy, 
but I am sure and I am hopeful that a few months from now, once 
this clique has been removed, that we may be able to resume 
Democracy Now and come back as a cohost, but, if not, I 
guarantee you that the network will not stay in the hands of these 
people. 

<p>And I know you can't say anything, Amy, because of the gag rule 
at this station as there are at many Pacifica stations right now and 
that's why I felt it important to resign as I make this statement, but 
my best luck, my best wishes to you and to all the other people of 
good will who are still working at Pacifica. Don't worry, the network 
will be rescued soon.  

<p>AG: Well, Juan, I don't know what to say except to say that it's 
been an incredible honor working with you over the last five years.  

<p>JG: And it's been an honor only working with you but all the other 
great producers that we've had over those five years, like Julie 
Drisen, and Dan Coughlin, and Jeremy Scahill, Maria Canino, David 
Love, Jesu Ko, Karen Palmer, and now, of course, Terry Allen and 
Chris Abrams, they've all been wonderful, and without them, we 
couldn't have done the work.  

<p>AG: Well, I'm going to miss you very, very much. Your contribution 
to Democracy Now has been, well, something beyond words that I 
have right now. We're going to move now into the rest of the 
program. We're going to play you a documentary. It's produced by 
Stacy Abramson and David Isay. David Isay, in fact, got his start at 
Pacifica Station WBAI in New York.  

<p>JG: Oh, Amy, one last word before I leave. Those phone numbers 
and those email addresses that I gave at the beginning of my 
statement. That's the phone number and the email address for 
listeners who want to support this campaign against the Pacifica 
Board. That's (212) 871-9322, and the email address is 
pacificacampaign@yahoo.com. Please communicate with me and 
others today, or tomorrow and in the coming days, and you can 
join the campaign to oust this board.  

<p>AG: Juan, it's been, again, an honor working with you. The 
documentary by David Isay and Stacy Abramson is called 
"Witness to an Execution." 
<p><b>Memo To Pacifica from Juan Gonzalez

<p>Re: Resignation

<p>This is to notify you that I am resigning as co-host of Democracy Now!
effective immediately.

<p>I take this action with much regret since, as you know, I have worked
alongside host Amy Goodman from the show's inception nearly five 
years ago and am proud of the groundbreaking work we have done to 
establish a
national radical news magazine. Even more important, I have listened to
Pacifica programs for more than 30 years and understand the critical role
the network has played in reporting important stories the corporate media
ignored, thus helping to shape progressive thought and popular 
movements throughout the country.

<p>But the current management situation at Pacifica has become intolerable,
and despite my hope that the majority of the Pacifica Foundation board of
directors would come to its senses, the situation has only gotten worse.
The last straw was the Christmas coup at WBAI last month.

<p>Quite simply, the Pacifica board has been hijacked by a small clique that
has more in common with corporate vultures than with working-class
Americans. That clique has illegally changed the Foundation's by-laws, and
during the past two years it has methodically sought to squash dissent
throughout the network -- first at KPFA, then at PNN news, then at
Democracy Now!, and now at WBAI. This group does not respect free 
speech. It does not respect labor or civil rights. It does not even 
practice due process for its own managers. And it is now seeking to 
radically alter
Pacifica's by-laws to pave the way for the selling of one or more stations.

<p>Furthermore, this clique insults Pacifica's loyal and sophisticated
listeners by  asking them to finance its shenanigans with their donations.

<p>Starting today, I will be joining other Pacifica listeners in a national
corporate campaign that will not rest until every board member who has
orchestrated this hijacking resigns and a new board is in place -- one that
is democratically accountable to the network's listeners, community and
staff.

<p>Our campaign will call for listeners across the country to withhold
donations to Pacifica in a mass referendum against your policies. Instead,
we will urge them to contribute their money to a variety of groups around
the country that are battling the Pacifica board -- including the legal
fund  for court suits which are currently challenging the board's
legitimacy.

<p>Mr. Murdock, Mr. Acosta, Mr. Palmer, you will soon find out that Pacifica
is listener-sponsored radio.
