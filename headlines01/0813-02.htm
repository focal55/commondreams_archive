WASHINGTON  - The World Wrestling Federation is
weighing a grudge match against the World Wildlife Fund, which has
won the first bout in a showdown over trademarks. 
<P>
The wildlife fund, known by the panda that is its logo and most
famous protégé, was founded 30 years ago. It sued the wrestling
federation, founded some 20 years ago, over use of the initials
WWF. On Friday, it won by a judge's decision in a London
courtroom. The wrestling federation said it plans to appeal the
ruling. <P>
Although the conservation group changed its name to the Worldwide
Fund for Nature 15 years ago, in the United States it is still
known by the original World Wildlife Fund. In 1994, it entered
into an agreement with the wrestling federation over the use of
the trademark initials. Since then, however, both have expanded
their presence on the Internet, where they have almost identical
web site addresses. <P>
As a result of the court ruling, however, the wrestling enterprise
will be allowed to retain limited use of its initials in the
United States only. It will be required to relinquish its prized
web site address. <P>
With the countdown now on to an October hearing to determine the
amount of costs and damages to be awarded, the wrestling
federation said in a statement, ''it is our intent to appeal the
judge's decision.'' <P>
''We do not believe there is confusion in the public's mind
between the World Wrestling Federation and the World Wildlife
Fund,'' it stated. 
<P>
The wrestling site, <a href="http://www.wwf.com" target="_new">www.wwf.com</a>, invited visitors Friday to ''win
a trip to Armageddon.'' The wildlife site, <a href="http://www.wwf.org" target="_new">www.wwf.org</a>, told
visitors, "Together, we can leave our children a living planet.'' 
<P>
The conservation group adorned its home page with pictures of a
rhinoceros, giant panda, tiger, and a pair of African elephants,
all apparently in repose. The wrestling home page was emblazoned
with images of such characters as The Rock and Undertaker in the
advanced stages of some form of rutting. <P>
Headlines on the wildlife fund's U.S. page included ''WWF Members
tell Congress: Save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.'' The
wrestling federation's headlines included ''Emotions Explode on
the Road to SummerSlam.'' <P>
The wildlife site offered shoppers a plush ''special edition Giant
Panda that you can make yourself.'' One dollar from the sale of
each ornament would go toward efforts to protect pandas. <P>
The wrestling site offered shoppers a line of greeting cards,
announcing: ''You've seen all those other greeting card sites,
with the pretty little messages and awe-inspiring thoughts. Well
(expletive) that. It's time to send your friends some World
Wrestling Federation Attitude.'' The company prides itself on
providing family entertainment and some of its stars read to
children in libraries, so the text substituted symbols for an
actual expletive. 
<P>
The Switzerland-based wildlife fund argued in court that the
similarity in web site address was confusing and meant the
charity's donors could not make contributions with confidence that
their money would end up in the right place. The organization
claimed some 4.7 million supporters in more than 100 countries. 
<P>
The U.S.-based wrestling federation struck back, saying the
conservationists had acted to put the entertainment enterprise in
a commercial arm lock. The company reported revenues of 456
million dollars in the year that ended on Apr. 30 and said 2.5
million people attended its live events. It is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, where its stock symbol is, to the chagrin of
its namesake, WWF. <P>
The judge hearing the case appeared to agree that the suit
represented a setback for the wrestlers' business but ruled that
the wildlife fund's fears were reasonable and that the
conservationists were within their rights. <P>
''We are pleased that the judge agreed with our position that the
World Wildlife Fund has acted to restrain our rights to trade,''
the wrestling enterprise said in its statement. ''However, we are
disappointed that the judge accepted the Fund's justifications for
these restraints without affording us a full trial and the right
to question the Fund on its need for these restrictions.'' <P>
Jerry McDevitt, an attorney for the company, was quoted in news
reports from London as saying that if the judge's ruling stands,
''all these millions and millions of fans - if the environmental
group had its way - would type in wwf.com, and instead of seeing
everything they've seen for years ... are going to be directed to
their site and learn about panda bears and whatever they're doing
to save the world.''
