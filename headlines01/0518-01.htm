LONDON/SYDNEY  - International environmental groups
slammed plans unveiled by President Bush to tackle a U.S. energy
crisis as disastrous and ``a crime,'' saying they would distance
Washington from the rest of the world.

But while Pacific islanders repeated fears that global
warming will raise sea levels and obliterate their homes,
Japanese policy makers, long struggling to promote nuclear energy
in the face of public mistrust, welcomed the blueprint.
<p>Bush laid out his plan of attack on Thursday against ``the
most serious energy shortage'' since the 1970s, calling for
heavier reliance on oil, coal and nuclear power, and $10 billion
in tax credits for conservation measures.
<p>Environmentalists in Asia expressed horror on Friday at the
proposals, echoing concerns voiced by counterparts in Europe.
<p>``We are all environmental criminals. But there must be a new
category for the United States. I would like to see an
international justice system that would recognize this crime,''
said Patrina Dumaru, climate officer for the Fiji-based Pacific
Concerns Resources Centre.
<p>Australian Greens leader Senator Bob Brown echoed Friends of
the Earth  in accusing Bush of a handout to oil interests.
<p>``He's come up with a combination of Exxon Valdez and
Chernobyl,'' said Brown, referring to the 1989 tanker oil spill
off Alaska and the Ukraine nuclear plant disaster 15 years ago.
<p>Greenpeace described the conservation measures on Thursday as
''window dressing'' and fellow campaigners Friends of the Earth
were particularly scathing about the plans for increasing nuclear
power and opening an Alaskan wildlife refuge to oil and gas
exploration.
<p>Charles Secrett, Executive Director of Friends of the Earth
in Britain, warned the plan ``threatening a new generation of
nuclear power stations, destruction of the Alaskan wilderness and
other environmentally disastrous proposals will distance the
United States even further from the main strain of environmental
concern across the rest of the planet.''
<p>The long-awaited report on national energy policy was
developed by a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney  and
presented by Bush during a speech to local business leaders in
St. Paul, Minnesota. As he spoke, hundreds of activists protested
outside.
<p>In the face of rolling power blackouts across the state of
California and increasing shortages, Bush said the plan was an
answer to a call for action.
<p>``If we fail to act, we could face a darker future, a future
that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas
pump and rolling blackouts in California,'' Bush said.
<p>Initial international reaction to the U.S. plans from most
governments was quiet, but Jan Pronk, head of the U.N. forum on
climate change, on Thursday dubbed it a ``disastrous development''
for international efforts to slow output of greenhouse gases.
<p>Pronk, also the Dutch environment minister, told Dutch
television the Bush plan would ``undoubtedly'' lead to increased
output of carbon dioxide, although he still awaited proposals
from the world's biggest polluter on how to cut emissions.
<p>``In terms of the possibility of forming an integrated policy
(to cut emissions), this is a disastrous development,'' he said.
<p>GLOBAL WARMING
<p>Greenpeace said the call to increase fossil fuels use ran
counter to efforts in other industrialized states to reduce the
output of so-called greenhouse gases.
<p>A United Nation's scientific body has said greenhouse gases,
such as carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels,
will contribute to warming of the earth's surface. That in turn
will lead to higher ocean levels, dramatic changes in weather
patterns and greater frequency of severe storms.
<p>``This plan is going to substantially increase U.S. greenhouse
gas emissions at a time when most of the industrialized countries
are trying to reduce them,'' Greenpeace climate policy director
Bill Hare told Reuters.
<p>Among the most vulnerable to climate change, a group
representing Pacific islanders complained on Friday the region's
concerns were being ignored, even though some of its tiny,
low-lying nations faced obliteration if sea levels rose too far.
<p>``If the worst comes to the worst, if it comes to the crunch
in climate change, some communities and cultures here will cease
to exist. It's totally unjust,'' said Dumaru of the Fiji-based
Pacific Concerns Resources Centre, a regional umbrella group for
non governmental organizations.
<p>In a sign that some other European allies have been angered
by U.S. policies affecting the environment, Bush's top economic
adviser Glenn Hubbard was lambasted at a meeting of
industrialized nations in Paris on Thursday for rejecting the
Kyoto protocol on global warming.
<p>The Kyoto accord commits developed countries to a five
percent cut of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by
2008-2012.
<p>French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius was adamant that the
U.S. rejection of Kyoto in March could damage Kyoto's success.
''The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol endangers the entire
process,'' Fabius said.
<p>Japanese government and industry officials welcomed Bush's
long-term energy proposals.
<p>``We are greatly encouraged by the fact that a nation that
plays a key role in the direction world energy policy takes has
shifted to backing nuclear power,'' said a spokesman for Japan's
government-backed Federation of Electric Power Companies.
<p>Japan operates 51 commercial nuclear reactors, which together
supply about a third of the nation's electric power. The
industry, however, has come under criticism for a series of
accidents, most notably the nation's worst in September 1999.
<p>Friends of the Earth, in a statement headlined ``Bush to
Planet Earth: Drop Dead,'' warned: ``The U.S. administration will
face protests at home and across the world if it ever tries to
put this plan into action.''
