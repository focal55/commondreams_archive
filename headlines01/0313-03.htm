WASHINGTON - Hundreds of demonstrators protested
outside the
offices of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America (PhRMA)
Monday in solidarity with the South African government, which is
currently
facing a patent infringement lawsuit lodged by a group of drug
companies. 
<P>
Chanting slogans and waving huge puppet effigies of pharmaceutical
executives
and US government officials, the demonstrators demanded that the
drug
companies
drop the lawsuit which seeks to block the implementation of a law
that would
permit the country to import or manufacture cheaper AIDS drugs. <P>
''The pharmaceutical companies would like to call South Africa a
criminal for
extending access to cheap drugs to people with HIV, but we know
who the real
criminals are,'' Asia Russell of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power (ACT UP)
told the demonstrators. <P>
At that point, the protestors turned and pointed towards the PhRMA
building
chanting ''Shame, shame, shame!'' PhRMA is the representative body
of the
country's leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. <P>
On Mar. 5, subsidiaries of about 40 major drug makers challenged a
1997 South
African law that permits the health minister to shop around for
the lowest
priced patented products around the world, under a practice termed
parallel
importing. The law also allows compulsory licensing, giving the
minister
powers
to permit local companies to manufacture generic versions of
patented drugs. <P>
South Africa justifies this by saying it is in crisis, with 4.3
million of the
country's 40 million people said to be HIV positive, making it one
of the
countries worst affected by the disease. <P>
Citing breach of intellectual property rights, the drug companies
filed a suit
against the South African government seeking to halt the
implementation of the
Medicines and Related Substances Control Act in the Pretoria High
Court. The
case was briefly heard and is set to resume Apr. 18. <P>
But activists charge that in the meantime many South Africans
continue to die
of AIDS, which is estimated to be growing at a rate of more than
1,000
infections each day in the country. <P>
The march on Monday is only further evidence that what started off
threeyears
ago as a case by the pharmaceutical companies against the South
African
government is increasingly taking on a global character. Doctors
Without
Borders, the France-based medical aid group, recently launched a
global
campaign known as the 'Drop the Case Petition' enlisting
individuals across
the
world to sign on and pressure the drug companies to quit. <P>
''We are here to tell the pharmaceutical industry that we will not
stand by
silently, any longer,'' Rachel Cohen of Doctors Without Borders
told
demonstrators in Washington. <P>
The British charity, Oxfam, has also started a campaign to push
GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK), the world's largest drugs company, to lead the way in
providing
affordable and effective medicines. <P>
''Murdered by GlaxoSmithKline'' read one of the banners, while
another said
''Pharmaceutical greed kills, stop drug lawsuit now.'' <P>
The pharmaceutical companies are increasingly being portrayed as
profit-hungry
businesses turning a blind eye to the plight of millions of people
in
developing countries. <P>
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 24 million of the 35 million people
living with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Many countries there are among
the world's
poorest and with per capita incomes averaging 500 dollars, AIDS
drugs are
beyond the reach of many. <P>
The cost of annual treatment with the triple-therapy cocktail of
anti-retroviral drugs that have proven effective in controlling
the
development
of HIV into AIDS in western countries is between 10,000 and 15,000
dollars per
person in the United States. Drug companies have generally been
unwilling to
give major price-breaks to poorer nations. <P>
It was only last year in May that five major pharmaceutical
companies - Glaxo
Wellcome, Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and
Bristol Myers
Squibb - began offering discounted prices to African nations. But
some of
these
discounts are reported to be as high as 90 percent of the US
price. <P>
The offers also came with numerous conditions limiting the amount
of drugs the
African countries would get. For instance, under the programme
only about
1,000
people in Senegal will get access to the medication. Except for
Rwanda, Uganda
and Senegal, countries on the continent have ignored the offer. <P>
Salih Booker, an Africa analyst, described the position drug firms
have taken
on South Africa as a new form of global apartheid. They remain
unmoved by the
disease's progress through Africa, the Caribbean islands and black
communities
in the United States. <P>
''Right now, the AIDS epidemic is killing Black people and that is
why the
world has been slow to act, that's why the pharmaceutical
companies do not
care,'' says Booker. <P>
But Indian drug manufacturers have moved to assist Africa, with
the recent
offer by Cipla to sell generic versions of the triple therapy anti-
retroviral
drugs to non governmental organisations for 350 dollars per person
per year. <P>
A second Indian manufacturer Hetero Drugs has also just announced
that it is
willing to sell generics of the triple therapy drugs to South
Africa for 347
dollars, if the country wins its lawsuit against the big drug
firms.  <P>
In turn, the drug companies have also announced major drug price
cuts. Merck
and Company has slashed the prices of two of its important AIDS
fighting drugs
in Africa by a further 40 and 50 percent of the price offered in
May. A number
of other drug firms have lowered their prices, with some even
undercutting the
prices of generics. <P>
Mark Grayson of PhRMA says further drug price cuts could be
expected and
dismissed the demonstrations as a waste of energy. <P>
''It is disappointing that all this energy is going into a protest
that will
not end up delivering the cheap drugs to poor people in Africa,''
says
Grayson.
''It will not change much whoever wins the South African lawsuit
because even
at the discounted prices many developing countries cannot afford
the drugs.
More energy should be spent ensuring that ways to pay for the
drugs and to
deliver them are found.'' <P>
But activists regard the South African case as a watershed which
may determine
the ability of many developing countries to acquire and produce
cheap
anti-AIDS
drugs.
