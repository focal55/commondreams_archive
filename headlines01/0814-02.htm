            WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 &#0151; With three justices taking the rare step 
            of disqualifying themselves because of their ties to a murder victim's 
            son, an evenly divided Supreme Court today turned down a request for 
            a stay of execution from a Texas inmate who is scheduled to be put 
            to death on Wednesday.
<P> The justices, Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas, 
              all have professional relationships with J. Michael Luttig, a prominent 
              federal appeals court judge whose father was murdered in a botched 
              carjacking in Texas in 1994. </P>
            <P> Mr. Luttig clerked for Justice Scalia and advised Justices Souter 
              and Thomas in confirmation hearings. </P>
            <P> Legal scholars said the court now found itself in a situation 
              that the founding fathers hoped to avoid by creating a Supreme Court 
              with an odd number of members. </P>
            <P> Because a majority is needed for a stay of execution, the court's 
              3-to-3 decision was a defeat for the death row inmate, Napoleon 
              Beazley. </P>
            <P> Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. 
              Breyer voted to grant the stay, the court's three-paragraph order 
              said. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Anthony M. 
              Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor voted to deny it. </P>
            <P> An hour after the court's action, the Texas Board of Pardons and 
              Paroles turned down Mr. Beazley's request for clemency by a vote 
              of 10 to 6. The six votes for clemency is one of the highest numbers 
              that a death row applicant has received from the board, which has 
              granted clemency in only one capital case since Texas resumed executing 
              inmates in 1982.</P>
            <P> Mr. Beazley's case has drawn international attention, especially 
              from groups opposed to executing offenders who commit their crimes 
              before the age of 18, including the European Union. Mr. Beazley 
              was 17 when he shot John Luttig, a Tyler, Tex., businessman, twice 
              in the head in his driveway during a botched carjacking.</P>
            <P> One of the parole board members, Filiberto Reyna, said he voted 
              with the majority in denying commutation because he said the brutality 
              of the crime demanded a death sentence. </P>
            <P> He discounted arguments by Mr. Beazley's lawyers that key testimony 
              in the trial had been invalidated by the decision of two co-defendants 
              to recant part of their statements. </P>
            <P> "I'm convinced it was premeditated, I'm convinced he knew what 
              he was doing," Mr. Reyna said. "It's extremely unfortunate that 
              we have such young members of our society involved in such offenses, 
              and I believe that it's a very poor commentary on our society. But 
              I still believe the nature of the offense warrants the punishment 
              imposed in this case."</P>
            <P> Another board member, Paddy Burwell, said he voted in favor of 
              commutation because of his concerns about the fairness of the trial 
              convinced him that the death penalty was too harsh. "I don't think 
              he's innocent," Mr. Burwell said. "I don't think he claims to be 
              innocent. But if you consider all the factors, it's not the right 
              thing to do." </P>
            <P> Mr. Beazley still has pending a motion before the Supreme Court 
              to review his case on the merits, including the question of whether 
              the constitution bars the execution of someone who was under the 
              age of 18 when he committed the crime. </P>
            <P> It takes four members of a nine- member Supreme Court to agree 
              to review a case on its merits. But with three justices having recused 
              themselves, the six-member court will be proceeding on largely uncharted 
              waters as it decides how many votes are necessary to grant Mr. Beazley's 
              motion.</P>
            <P> "The court has been haunted in the past by situations like this," 
              said Richard Pildes, a former Supreme Court clerk and now a professor 
              of constitutional law at New York University Law School. "One of 
              the reasons the court has an odd number of members is precisely 
              to avoid situations like this, where major issues are decided by 
              a tie vote, particularly in capital cases," he added.</P>
            <P> A vote of a majority of justices is required for a stay of execution, 
              which would be five in normal cases, and four in this case, with 
              only six justices sitting. In 1985, the court denied a stay of execution 
              to a Georgia death row inmate, Roosevelt Green, on a 4-to-4 vote, 
              with Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. not voting because of illness. 
              That a man could be executed on a tie vote brought tremendous criticism 
              on the court, Mr. Pildes said.</P>
            <P> Today, the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
              Inc. and a veteran death penalty lawyer, George Kendall, said, "A 
              tie shouldn't go to the executioner."</P>
            <P> The problem for the court is compounded, Mr. Pildes and other 
              legal scholars said, when there are not enough votes for a stay, 
              but enough votes on the court to hear a case on the merits. Only 
              four votes are required for the court to grant a motion to review 
              a case.</P>
            <P> This sets up the possibility that there are enough votes to hear 
              a case on the merits, but not enough to stop the execution so that 
              such a hearing can held. Mr. Pildes said that in the past justices 
              have recognized that this would cast the Supreme Court in a bad 
              light, and so some justices have therefore voted for a stay even 
              when they did not think the inmate's assertions were meritorious.</P>
            <P> The rule on how many votes are needed for a review on the merits 
              is set by the court, and because the situation of the court having 
              only six members is so rare, Supreme Court officials and legal scholars 
              were scrambling today to determine how many votes would be needed 
              in this case. In a 1971, with two vacancies on the court, Justice 
              William O. Douglas expressed his opinion that only three votes were 
              needed to grant a petition for review, in a case involving constitutional 
              questions about the rights of a Jehovah's Witness to avoid military 
              conscription.</P>
            <P> Legal scholars and death penalty lawyers said today that they 
              were not aware of an instance in which a single justice had disqualified 
              himself in a death penalty case, let alone three.</P>
            <P> A Supreme Court spokesman said a federal statute governed justices 
              in recusal matters. The law says a justice "shall disqualify himself 
              in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be 
              called into question."</P>
            <P> Death penalty lawyers said it was likely that the three justices 
              who voted for a stay, Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer, would 
              also vote to hear the case on the merits.</P>
            <P> The constitutional question is whether executing a juvenile offender 
              is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. 
              In 1989, the Supreme Court, in Stanford v. Kentucky, ruled 5 to 
              4 that it did not. The majority opinion was written by Justice Scalia. 
            </P>
            <P> Mr. Beazley's lawyers also want the court to rule that the United 
              States is bound by international law and treaties not to execute 
              a juvenile offender. In the last decade, only six other countries 
              have executed a juvenile offender — Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
              Saudi Arabia and Yemen — a report by Amnesty International said.</P>
            <P> Separate from the Supreme Court, Mr. Beazley's case will now be 
              reviewed by Gov. Rick Perry. Under Texas law, Mr. Perry has only 
              two options now that the parole board has rejected commutation; 
              he can either grant a one-time 30-day stay or allow the execution 
              to proceed. Mr. Long, the appellate lawyer, said he hoped that Mr. 
              Perry would be swayed by the dissenters on the parole board. "I 
              do think that the governor should look closely at the fact that 
              there were six board members who voted for a commutation in the 
              case and 10 who voted not to," Mr. Long said. </P>
            <P> He also said he planned to file a motion with the Texas Court 
              of Criminal Appeals seeking a stay.
