RIO DE JANEIRO  - Preserving and promoting gastronomic
diversity - threatened by the rushed pace of modern society - are
the goals of Slow Food, an international movement, based in Italy,
that began 15 years ago and continues to win followers worldwide. 
<P>
   Its name is an intended contrast to ''fast food'', the globally
recognized symbol of which is the US-based restaurant chain
McDonald's. But Slow Food's activities and ideas are wide-ranging,
encompassing a variety of dimensions of life - beyond meals. 
<P>
   Local Slow Food groups are known as ''convivium'', a Latin term
meaning ''banquet'' and which gave rise to the English word
''convivial'' - fond of feasting and merry company - and the
French ''convive'' - dining companion. 
<P>
   There are at least 560 convivia in 45 countries, with some
60,000 members in all, according to the Slow Food website
(<a href="http://www.slowfood.com" target="new">www.slowfood.com</a>). 
<P>
   The movement rejects the ''globalization of a taste that does
not belong to the people,'' explained Jorge Ossanai, a doctor in
the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. His interest in
ethnic food and his travels as an international consultant brought
him into contact with Slow Food, of which he is now an active
member. 
<P>
   The protest against hurried and solitary meals has expanded to
include efforts to protect the culinary culture of each community,
explained Margarida Nogueira, a food consultant and organizer of
the convivium in Rio de Janeiro. 
<P>
   Conservation of this sort of culture occurs through recovering
traditional dishes that are threatened with disappearing forever,
such as the 'lardo de Colonnata,' an Italian bacon prepared in
marble Carrara boxes, Nogueira told IPS. <P>
   ''We have a tendency to kill traditions,'' which impoverishes
gastronomy, lamented the expert. To fight this trend, she has
plans to recover some of the typical dishes of Rio de Janeiro
state. One of her concerns, for example, is the ''disappearance''
of a purple sweet potato from supermarket shelves, a vegetable she
frequently enjoyed in the past. <P>
   Along those lines, the Rio convivium, founded last November,
meets monthly and is promoting meetings with farmers who grow
produce that does not always reach the larger markets. <P>
   Traditional food products, often hand-processed by a community
or by a family, are far from the consumer market, and so are
relatively expensive, Nogueira pointed out. <P>
   To save certain foods from oblivion, Slow Food created the Ark
of Taste, an evocation of Noah, as a mechanism for the
preservation of taste diversity and biodiversity. <P>
   At first, the Ark was intended to identify and catalogue nearly
forgotten fruits, vegetables, herbs, and sweets - and to promote
their consumption. <P>
   When the movement discovers that a dish is at serious risk of
extinction, its takes action to support the preservation of the
food - or drink -, as was the case of Sciacchetra white wine,
produced in the Italian mountains of Cinque Terre. <P>
   The movement also engages in social projects through its
''fraternity tables,'' which provide food to impoverished or
conflict-ridden communities. 
<P>
   In Brazil, the Slow Food Hekura Project is in charge of the
hospital kitchen at Porto Velho, capital of the Amazon state of
Rondonia, a health center that provides medical attention to the
region's indigenous population. 
<P>
   The mission there is to ensure that indigenous patients who are
undernourished or have a slow recovery process ahead of them are
provided with their traditional foods, so that they do not have to
adapt to the food available in the predominantly ''white'' cities,
Nogueira explained. 
<P>
   Ossanai, for his part, said that within the Slow Food movement
another parallel philosophy has arisen, known as Slow City, with
the intent to protect the heritage of smaller urban centers as a
means to foment local cultural identity and to preserve the
environment. 
<P>
   In Italy, the program already involves a network of 36
cities. Slow City activists in southern Brazil are attempting to
launch similar efforts in Antonio Prado, in the southern state of
Rio Grande do Sul, home to 48 wooden houses built more than 125
years ago by Italian immigrants. 
<P>
   To preserve this sort of heritage, which ''the local population
is sometimes ashamed of,'' the movement provides technical advice,
mobilizes local resources and seeks international financing,
reported the Porto Alegre physician. 
<P>
   Each convivium attempts to spread the ideas behind Slow Food
through public presentations, visits to farming areas and ''taste
education'' activities targeting children, so that they might
learn to use their senses ''as an instrument of knowledge'' and to
appreciate food as an important part of their culture. 
<P>
   As of last year, the movement grants a Slow Food Award for the
Defense of Biodiversity to five food-related projects around the
world. An international jury of 460 people, selected from among
journalists, anthropologists, sociologists and chefs, made the
selection for the first-ever awards. 
<P>
   One of the recipients was Raúl Manuel Antonio, leader of a
Mexican indigenous community, for his efforts to maintain vanilla
and cacao crops after they had nearly disappeared from the region
of Chialta, in the southwest state of Oaxaca. <P>
   Another prizewinner was Nancy Jones, of Mauritania, who
convinced the livestock herders in her country to produce cheese
using camel milk, something local residents had formerly rejected
because they considered the milk sacred. <P>
   For this year's Slow Food Award, to be presented in the
Portuguese city of Oporto this October, Brazil's convivium leader
Nogueira nominated Sitio do Moinho, a farm near Rio de Janeiro
that grows a broad range of organic produce, meaning no agro-
chemicals are used. <P>
   Manoel Dantas Vilar, a rancher in northeast Brazil who produces
cheese from a local species of goat, an animal resistant to the
region's many droughts, is another candidate. <P>
   And yet another Brazilian aspirant for this year's prize is
Kimio Shimitsu, of Japanese descent, who prepares food - as well
as homes, furniture and water filters - using bamboo, in Mogi das
Cruzes, near Sao Paulo.<p align="center">Copyright 2001 IPS</p>
