HARRISBURG - The board overseeing a state retirement fund on Wednesday will consider its investments in corporations with ties to foreign governments with records of human-rights violations, two board members said. <BR>
<BR>
"We'll talk about it and have a closer look at our investment policy," said state Sen. Raphael Musto, a Democrat from Luzerne County and a member of the State Employees' Retirement System board. "We certainly do not want to be helping, financially, some countries not favorable to human rights. That is not a policy we intend to pursue." <BR>
<BR>
State Treasurer Barbara Hafer, also a board member, said: "I will bring this up on Wednesday and ask for some kind of briefing." <BR>
<BR>
Action to divest the controversial holdings, however, appears unlikely. <BR>
<BR>
A spokesman for Gov. Tom Ridge, who has three appointees on the board, said the board's primary responsibility is its fiduciary obligation to state retirees. It is "a very slippery slope" once investments are weighed based on social factors, said Ridge spokesman Tim Reeves. <BR>
<BR>
The comments came after disclosures Sunday by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that about $100 million of the $30 billion pension fund for state employees is invested in five foreign corporations whose profits benefit regimes with records of human-rights violations. (<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0121-04.htm">see story here</a>) <BR>
<BR>
The corporations in question have helped to finance enslavement of Christians in Sudan; the construction of missiles in Iraq and Iran; and the smuggling of automatic weapons from China to the United States. <BR>
<BR>
An 11-member board oversees the State Employees' Retirement System. Board members said Monday that they rely on professional managers for individual investments and can't be aware of the details of billions of dollars worth of investments. <BR>
<BR>
"Obviously, the final decision is the board's, and we'll respect their judgment," Reeves said, adding that Ridge would not intervene with his appointees to change the investments or to keep the status quo. <BR>
<BR>
"If a company's conduct is so egregious that large majorities of people" reject that conduct, "then the marketplace will make that decision," Reeves said. <BR>
<BR>
As a matter of policy, Ridge believes the retirement board should base investments on financial rather than social factors, Reeves said. <BR>
<BR>
Hafer, however, has attempted without success to get the board to divest of tobacco-related investments. She said a separate retirement fund for teachers capped its investment in tobacco-related industries. <BR>
<BR>
Hafer contended there are "much bigger issues of ethics and morality that outweigh fiduciary responsibilities." <BR>
<BR>
"There are many other funds that make as much money," she said, adding that there is room for "socially responsible investing." <BR>
<BR>
Hafer said it would be a lot easier if state managers of pension funds received a danger list of questionable investments from the federal government. <BR>
<BR>
"For us to track it would be very, very difficult. It'd be a lot easier if we had a list of the bad guys," she said. <BR>
<BR>
State Rep. Jere Strittmatter, a Republican from Lancaster County who serves on the state retirement board, said: "The money managers are making those decisions (on investments)." <BR>
<BR>
Only federal officials are qualified to judge whether investments in foreign-based corporations are against U.S. interests, Strittmatter said. <BR>
<BR>
The responsibility of the state managers is to ensure that the money is invested in legal securities, he said. <BR>
<BR>
The board's basic policy has been not to place limits on the types of investments that may be made, Strittmatter said. <BR>
<BR>
 "I'm saying I don't have all the facts to know what is happening" with specific foreign investments, he said. "I would presume our U.S. government knows what those (international) relations are," Strittmatter said. <BR>
