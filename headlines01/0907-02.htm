GENOA, ITALY --
His landslide election in May left Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi looking like Europe's latest reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
<P>The autocratic conservative, nicknamed "the Cavalryman" (Il Cavaliere), 
promised a 100-day revolution that would transform his nation's flagging 
economy with efficient business methods and bolster its international profile 
with decisive, unflinching governance.
<P>No one imagined that Berlusconi, who built an immense corporate and media 
empire before entering politics, would soon find himself tottering helplessly 
on the battlefield of globalization.
<P>Then came the July G-8 summit in this ancient port city. The violent 
confrontations between anti-globalization protesters and police left one 
demonstrator dead, 351 people wounded, 301 arrested -- and the Cavalryman's 
administration reeling.
<P>

The police were demonstrating for the right to carry out their work following the intense criticism they have faced after their part in the fatal demonstrations at the Genoa G8 Summit. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is hoping to move controversial Nato and FAO summits scheduled for later in the year out of the city centers. REUTERS/Salvatore Laporta<br>

</font>"His own ministers quarrel among themselves from morning to night," said 
leftist opposition leader Francesco Rutelli, with barely concealed delight. 
"Che bruta figura!"
<P>This withering insult -- which roughly translates as "what a lousy 
impression" -- has come to symbolize a government that has produced virtually 
no legislation, much less a new Italy.
<P>Instead Italians are being treated to endless waves of back-stabbing and 
recrimination over the G-8 debacle and the government's collective shudder at 
the prospect of two more summits planned for Italy this autumn. A repeat of 
the Genoa events at either of them, Berlusconi and his aides fear, could 
virtually kill the new administration.
<P>Defense ministers of 19 North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are 
scheduled to meet for two days in Naples later this month. Then in early 
November, the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization is scheduled to hold a 
four-day World Food Summit at the FAO's headquarters in Rome to discuss global 
malnutrition and famine.
<P>"Scheduled" is the operative word. As recently as a week ago, Berlusconi's 
government was desperately hoping that another country would take the summits 
off its hands -- until its NATO allies and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
flatly declared that they had no intention of transferring their events beyond 
Italy's borders.
<P>With an audible sigh, Berlusconi conceded that Italy would host the summits 
as planned, but he is determined to shift them away from the urban centers of 
Rome and Naples.
<P>The NATO meeting is likely to wind up behind the barbed wire of a military 
base, or on a remote island off the Italian coast. However, the United Nations 
is adamant that its summit be held in a publicly accessible venue, within easy 
reach of an international airport. A joint FAO-Italian government commission 
is studying the alternatives.
<P>In the meantime, not a single logistical measure has been taken to prepare 
for the arrival of 100 chiefs of state and 7,000 participants, representing 
150 nations and 630 nongovernmental organizations, along with an estimated 2,
500 journalists.
<P>In the latest twist, the government has proposed the town of Fiuggi -- a 
luxurious thermal bath resort outside of Rome -- for a summit dedicated to 
world hunger.
<P>A second possibility, the castle of Spoleto, was boosted by a local 
politician who pointed out that it was "located on a hill . . . surrounded by 
an imposing wall of granite."
<P>A third proposed site, the thermal spa of Salsomaggiore, was withdrawn from 
consideration because the summit would have had to share facilities with the 
Miss Italy Contest.
<P>At one point, Berlusconi had suggested that the FAO summit "be transferred 
to Africa," where most protesters would presumably find it difficult to travel.
<P>He drifted into pained silence at the resulting storm of ridicule, much of 
which came from within the ranks of his own right-wing coalition.
<P>Adding to Il Cavaliere's woes are the no fewer than 12 separate inquests 
and pretrial hearings set in motion by the G-8 melee. The most controversial 
opened in Genoa on Aug. 28, when 16 police officers were placed under formal 
investigation on charges that include manslaughter and attempted homicide.
<P>In Rome, meanwhile, a parade of law enforcement officials have been fired, 
including the former police commissioner of Genoa, the former state anti-
terrorism chief and the former vice director of police operations.
<P>Testifying for 11 hours before a parliamentary commission, the common 
thread in the accounts given by the officials -- apart from blaming each other 
-- was that Berlusconi's interior ministry micromanaged the summit's security 
measures from Rome, while insisting for public consumption that policing was 
overseen by the municipal authorities of Genoa.
<P>"Perhaps the truth is beginning to emerge," one of Berlusconi's own 
commissioners at the hearing admitted.
<P>Meanwhile, Italian leaders of the anti-globalization movement told 
reporters that at least 50,000 protesters would show up in Naples, even if the 
NATO delegates were locked up on a military base or exiled to an offshore 
island.</p>
