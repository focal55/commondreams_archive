GENEVA - Top United Nations officials have issued  
urgent appeals to governments around the world, exhorting them to  
be more flexible in order to prevent the failure of the upcoming  
World Conference against Racism. 
<P>
   ''We are now at the stage where we need to begin reaching  
agreements,'' stressed the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  
Mary Robinson, Tuesday. 
<P>
   The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,  
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance is set for Aug 31 to Sep 7 in  
Durban, South Africa. But there is still no agreement on the  
content of the final declaration or the program of action that  
are to be adopted by the delegates to the conference. 
<P>
   Irreconcilable differences revolve around questions of  
reparations for human rights abuses committed during slavery and  
colonial eras, and of attempts to equate Zionism with racism. <P>
   The final attempt to hammer out agreements on these matters  
will be in the hands of the preparatory committee during two weeks  
of deliberations in Geneva, beginning Jul 30. 
<P>
   Robinson acknowledged that the drafting of the conference  
declaration and program of action has not been a simple process. 
<P>
   The Group of 21, a body with the sole mission of conducting a  
''technical cleanup'' of the documents - not of carrying out  
negotiations - will present the final Durban conference drafts  
Monday to the preparatory committee. <P>
   The group, presided by South Africa, is made up of Barbados,  
Brazil, Chile and Mexico, representing Latin America and the  
Caribbean. The African bloc consists of Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal  
and Tunisia, while Canada, France, Sweden and the United States  
are the ''Western'' bloc. <P>
   Eastern Europe is represented by the Czech Republic, Croatia,  
Macedonia and Russia. The nations from Asia participating in the  
talks are India, Iran, Pakistan and Iraq <P>
   The mission of the document ''cleanup'' team has been bogged  
down by the delicate nature of the matters to be debated at the  
Durban conference. <P>
   Robinson commented Tuesday before the UN Economic and Social  
Council (ECOSOC) that the World Conference against Racism will  
cover ''not just matters of domestic policy and practice but, in  
some cases, fundamental issues of national identity.'' <P>
   ''While individual societies have embarked on processes of  
reflection and reconciliation, we as a global community have never  
attempted it before,'' she pointed out. <P>
   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued an appeal to ''find ways  
to acknowledge the past without getting lost there; and to help  
heal old wounds without reopening them.'' <P>
   In a further attempt to exert pressure on the world's  
governments, the High Commissioner is slated to meet in Geneva Aug  
3 with a group of ''Eminent Persons'', led by former South African  
president, Nelson Mandela. <P>
   Among other notables, the group also includes former  
presidents, such as Jimmy Carter, of the United States, Mikhail  
Gorbachov, of the now-defunct Soviet Union, and Oscar Arias, of  
Costa Rica. <P>
   UN officials close to the process are confident that the  
arguments of these personalities, to be expressed during a round- 
table discussion, will influence the governmental delegates  
gathered in a nearby hall to discuss the final documents for  
Durban. <P>
   The UN sources also believe that the run-up to the Durban  
conference has already proven successful because it has ''engaged  
individuals and civil society as much as states.'' 
<P>
   ''The enormous response from NGOs (non-governmental  
organizations) has made it clear that Durban will not be a dry  
political gathering dominated by technical negotiations,'' said  
Robinson. 
<P>
   In the South African city, there will be an enriching gathering  
of peoples and cultures, alongside an inspiring exchange of ideas  
and experiences, predicted the High Commissioner. <P>
   In addition to the Conference against Racism, an NGO Forum is  
slated to meet in Durban Aug 28 to Sep 1, and a Youth Summit on  
Aug 26 and 27. 
<P>
   Robinson stressed that during the preparatory phase of the  
conference, ''the profile of racism as a global issue has been  
raised to an unprecedented level. The regional preparatory  
meetings have recognized that racism is a problem in every country  
and every region.'' 
<P>
   She expressed confidence that the conference will ultimately be  
a success, though said she is sure that ''no country or group will  
walk away completely satisfied.'' <P>
   ''At a time when the international community is grappling with  
so many complex global problems, we simply cannot afford to fail  
to find consensus on an issue as clear-cut as racism,'' asserted  
the High Commissioner. <P>
   The minimum objectives of the UN for the Durban conference  
include a declaration that ''solemnly acknowledges the wrongs of  
the past, notes the current manifestations of racism, racial  
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.'' <P>
   The document must also commit governments to ''moving forward  
together in the fight against racism.'' 
<P>
   A second goal is a program of action that outlines practical  
steps for fulfilling these commitments. 
<P>
   Finally, the UN intends to forge an alliance between  
governments and civil society ''that will enable the struggle  
against racism to be carried beyond Durban.''
