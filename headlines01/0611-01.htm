OKLAHOMA CITY - As dusk fell on this city on the American plain last night, many prayed dawn would bring news of an execution they hope will heal the wounds inflicted by Timothy McVeigh.
<P></P>
Patrick Reeder was not among them.
<P></P>
He's had enough of killing.
<P></P>
Reeder, who lost his 33-year-old wife, Michelle, and mother-in-law Carolyn Kreymborg to McVeigh's evil explosion that April 19th, says he'll win no peace nor take any pleasure from McVeigh's execution, set for 8 a.m. EDT today in Terre Haute, Ind.
<P></P>
``His crime was horrible. Absolutely,'' says the 40-year-old former Marine. ``But this execution is just cheapening the overall value of human life. It perverts the idea of justice.''
<P></P>
This morning's execution of McVeigh, an American terrorist who killed 168 people, including 19 children - the youngest was 3-month-old Gabreon Bruce - has touched off renewed debate about capital punishment in this country - even among survivors and families in Oklahoma City still grieving for their dead.
<P></P>
``I had an argument about this last night with my brother-in-law,'' says Reeder, seated in the front room of his bungalow in suburban Bethany not far from downtown.
<P></P>
Reeder says the experience of having lived through the loss of life has made him more aware of its sanctity and preciousness.
<P></P>
``Justice means making McVeigh pay for his crime,'' he says. ``Life in prison would have done that.
<P></P>
``A lot of victims are counting on the execution to clear up their lives, to make things better. I hope it's the miracle cure they're looking for. But I don't think they're going to find it.''
<P></P>
Reeder is also dismayed at the execution's closed-circuit broadcast here in Oklahoma City for some 300 survivors and family members.
<P></P>
``It reminds me of the blood spectacles of ancient Rome. It transforms any idea of execution as a form of justice into revenge.
<P></P>
``Personally, I wish we could just skip the execution.''
<P></P>
But if he had to live it all over again, Patrick Reeder would have preferred if time itself had skipped over a single minute in the course of history: 9:02 a.m., April 19, 1995.
<P></P>
It was a clear and cool Wednesday morning with temperatures in the 60s.
<P></P>
``I was sitting at the dining room table reading the morning paper,'' he recalls. ``I didn't hear anything. But I felt it.''
<P></P>
About 10 kilometres away, McVeigh's 3,200-kilogram bomb clawed away the front of the nine-floor Alfred P. Murrah Building where Michelle Reeder worked for the government's Federal Housing Authority.
<P></P>
Oklahoma City sometimes has small, almost imperceptible earthquakes from time to time.
<P></P>
``I thought it was one of those,'' Patrick explains, adding that it shook the house for several seconds.
<P></P>
``The first thing I did was get on the phone to call Michelle to ask if she'd felt that. All I got was a busy signal.''
<P></P>
Moments later, someone phoned. It was a friend telling Reeder to turn on the television. There'd been an explosion downtown.
<P></P>
``And that's when my life fell apart,'' he says.
<P></P>
Only 13 minutes after the explosion, a local TV station had a helicopter in the air with a Live Eye approaching the scene from the north.
<P></P>
From that perspective, the Murrah Building was standing, seemingly unaffected. No damage was visible, although there was smoke pouring from the other side if it.
<P></P>
The Live Eye advanced and was soon above the building and then, in a breathtaking moment, the building's southern face came into view.
<P></P>
``I was in shock,'' says Reeder. ``The front of the building had been blown off, a big chunk. And her office was in the middle of that big chunk, on the fourth floor.''
<P></P>
The couple had met at a high school football game in 1978. She was 17.
<P></P>
``She was sweet, nicely shy, but proper and very firm.
<P></P>
``I, of course, was crass and a little obnoxious. I was a player myself but had an injury and so I ended up watching the game from the stands. I got nowhere with her with the intentions most young men have at that age.''
<P></P>
But within weeks, Patrick Reeder knew he wanted to marry her and he did so in August, 1980 after graduation. In 1981, he joined the Marine Corps. The couple toured for 13 years with the Marines, before seeking a discharge and returning to Oklahoma to be near Michelle's family in 1994.
<P></P>
They bought a house. This very house. The one in which the front room is adorned with pictures of Michelle, a smiling brown-haired woman who seemed to be in perennially good humour.
<P></P>
For Patrick, her death was the beginning of two years of self-destructive drinking. He nearly died in hospital in August, 1997 from heart complications. Counselling, sobriety and friends brought him back.
<P></P>
``I had to escape my self-pity,'' he says. ``I had to realize that my own grief wasn't the centre of the universe.
<P></P>
``After all, when Michelle died, most of the world sympathized. When people die of cancer, no one extends themselves except family and friends. Here I had the benefit of the world's support.''
<P></P>
Another beneficiary of that outpouring of support was Dr. Paul Heath, one of the survivors of the McVeigh bombing.
<P></P>
A psychologist, he spent yesterday down at the serene and magnificent monument that has been erected on the site where Heath very nearly lost his life.
<P></P>
``I was on the fifth floor of the building, 65 feet away from McVeigh's bomb truck,'' Heath recalls.
<P></P>
Heath actually met McVeigh in the Veterans' Administration offices on the fifth floor on Thursday, April 13, when McVeigh had apparently come into the building to case it before the bombing.
<P></P>
``He said he was in the area looking for work. He was well-spoken and very friendly,'' says Heath.
<P></P>
Six days later, McVeigh returned, detonating the bomb.
<P></P>
Perhaps surprisingly Heath, who is the founder and former president of the survivors' association here, doesn't support capital punishment either.
<P></P>
Still, he was one of the key people who made the closed-circuit broadcast of today's execution possible for the families who wanted it.
<P></P>
``They won't get closure out of this,'' he said of those who will view the execution. ``I don't even know who invented the word closure for this kind of event. But what they will get, is the satisfaction of saying they were there when Timothy McVeigh died - and that McVeigh can no longer hurt your family or theirs.''
