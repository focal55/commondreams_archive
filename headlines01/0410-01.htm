QUEBEC — Separation has always been entwined in the raison d'être of this beguiling bit of France, a walled city perched on a towering promontory and defined by the limits of geography, language and politics.
<P> The French built forts to keep out the British, then the British erected their own walls here to keep out the upstart Americans. More recently, separatists have made Quebec their ideological bastion, at times banning even the sight of a Canadian flag as they battled to win independence.</P>

Wall of Shame: Workers building part of a six-mile security barrier for the 34-nation Summit of the Americas, to take place in Quebec from April 20 to 22.  (Robert J. Galbraith for The NY Times)<br>

Now Quebec is putting up a new wall, one to separate Canadians from President Bush and the 33 other national leaders who will attend the Summit of the Americas here on April 20 to 22. At the top of their agenda is the formation of a hemispheric free trade area extending from the high Arctic to Tierra del Fuego.
<P> Thousands of police officers are coming to back up what is being called Quebec's "wall of shame," and many Canadians are asking whether such separation is necessary, or is anti-democratic overkill, infringing not only on the rights of protesters but also on the character of a country known for tolerance and civility. </P>
<P> "It's not setting the kind of example that I think Canadians would like to set for the world," said A. Alan Borovoy, general counsel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Union.</P>
<P> With anti-globalization graffiti in French, English and Franglais already appearing on Quebec walls ("Le Pouvoir au Peuple, pas aux Multinationals!") crews are working 12-hour days to erect almost three miles of chain-link fence and concrete highway abutments. The 10- foot-high fence will constitute a formidable barrier almost six miles long around the conference center where the meeting will take place. In some stretches, the cliff on which Quebec sits serves as part of the barricade. In others, the new wall rises just feet from the stone fortifications built by British engineers two centuries ago. </P>
<P> The police contend that the layout of Quebec, with its sloping hills and narrow streets, makes a barrier necessary to separate protesters from the delegates and ensure the participants' safe passage into and out of the meeting site.</P>
<P> But with the fence in place, most protesters will be kept downhill from the buildings where the officials are to meet and too far away to reach the ears and eyes of the dignitaries they hope to convince of the inequities of free trade. </P>
<P> The mayor of Quebec, Jean-Paul L'Allier, is learning what it feels like to be caught on the dividing line between opposing forces. He said that when Quebec was approached several years ago to hold the summit meeting he was overjoyed. Quebec has long been a champion of free trade, he said, going back to its founding in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, a shrewd explorer who saw in North America the chance to extend France's commercial opportunities. </P>
<P> "If Champlain were back here now, he would probably be in favor of globalization," Mr. L'Allier said. </P>
<P> He began thinking differently about the summit meeting in late 1999 when protesters disrupted the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle. Televised images of violent clashes with the police suddenly made the mayor realize that he would have to plan fortifications, not festivities. For a time he wanted the meeting canceled. </P>
<P> "Now we're doing our very best to take the lessons of Seattle, not only insofar as having a stronger police force but in having stronger ways of making people feel capable of utilizing their right of free speech," Mr. L'Allier said. Quebec is providing space in the lower town, more than a mile from the meeting site, for protesters to hold an alternative people's summit meeting.</P>
<P> Mr. L'Allier, who for years refused to fly the Canadian flag at City Hall because of disputes with the federal government, has worked to beautify old Quebec in the 12 years he has been mayor. He concedes that the new fence makes an ugly statement in a city of such history and charm that it has been declared a world heritage site by the United Nations. But he believes it is necessary. </P>
<P> "I was more nervous at the beginning but now I realize that the police forces have no mandate to clash with the crowd," he said. "They will make sure private properties are protected, and they have a mandate to be cool, like sometimes they are in France."</P>
<P> More than 3,000 members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will be on duty for the summit meeting, along with 2,000 from the Quebec provincial police and hundreds more from the local police departments of Quebec City and the nearby town of Sainte-Foy , where the airport is. Constable Julie Brongel, a spokeswoman, said Mounties at the meeting will not use pepper spray for crowd control but will have trained dogs.</P>
<P> Police officials have emptied a nearby jail to hold unruly demonstrators. In their zeal to prevent a repeat of Seattle they also tried, unsuccessfully, to get Sainte-Foy to prohibit wearing scarves as masks. Quebec has had a similar law on the books since 1864. But "our instruction to the police force is not to take care about that," the mayor said. </P>
<P> Mr. L'Allier thinks that the police may very well outnumber protesters at the summit meeting. But activists are predicting that 15,000 or more will come. Crowds have already shown up at pre-meeting demonstrations in Ottawa and Toronto, and Canadian immigration officials have stopped protesters at the border. </P>
<P> For the government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, the delicate questions of who gets in and who stays out are not restricted to the border or the streets. He has been criticized for excluding Cuba, and Quebec separatists. </P>
<P> Quebec has erected blue banners on the road from the airport welcoming delegates to "la capitale nationale." Officials expected to be invited to welcome the meeting's dignitaries and extol Quebec's virtues. But Mr. Chrétien, a staunch anti-separatist, has refused to give them a platform. </P>
<P> In the end Quebec and Canada are left to confront the conflict between access and separation as they always have, with dogged compromise. </P>
<P> "In Canada we don't ban demonstrations," Mr. Borovoy, the civil activist, said with resignation to match the mood created by the impasse over summit security. "We just reroute them."</P>
