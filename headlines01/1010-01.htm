GENEVA  - A report released Tuesday by the
humanitarian group
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF - <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org" target="_new">Doctors Without Borders</a>) says
almost no new
drugs are being developed for diseases that primarily affect the
world's
poor populations. 
<P>
The MSF report, titled "Fatal Imbalance: The Crisis in Research
and
Development for Drugs for Neglected Diseases", states that in the
last five
years the world's 11 leading pharmaceutical corporations have
placed just
one tuberculosis medication on the market. <P>
The combined sales of these transnational laboratories reach
approximately
117 billion dollars annually. <P>
Eight of these 11 companies "have conducted no research in the
last year
for fatal diseases that almost exclusively affect the poor:
sleeping
sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis," according to the
Paris-based
MSF, 1999 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. <P>
The release of the report coincided with the opening in Geneva of
the Global
Forum for Health Research, whose goal is precisely "to correct
this
inequitable and inefficient gap." 
<P>
The Forum, an international foundation based in this Swiss city,
unites
representatives of governments, universities, the pharmaceutical
industry,
United Nations agencies, research centers and non-governmental
organizations
(NGOs). 
<P>
The chairman of the Forum, Adetokunbo Lucas, of the Harvard School
of Public
Health, said Tuesday that the public and private sectors spend
more than 70
billion dollars annually on health-related research and
development. <P>
But just 10 percent of that sum is spent on research on 90 percent
of the
world's existing health problems, which the Forum considers a
misallocation
of resources, known as the "10/90 gap", and proposes to correct
within the
next 30 years. <P>
Mozambique's Prime Minister Pascual Mocumbi commented that it is
lamentable
that the elimination of the health gap will require such a long-
term effort. 
<P>
"We need to utilize better the 10 percent that we have, and
broaden our
thinking about how to allocate additional resources made available
over
time," he said in his speech inaugurating the meeting of the
Forum. 
<P>
Walter Fust, director of the Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation,
commented that the "10/90 gap" is "ignominious". <P>
Fust said "the profits from developing new medications for a
disease that
affects mostly the poorest countries of the world are judged by
the
pharmaceutical industry to be too small to justify new
investments." 
<P>
In 'Fatal Imbalance'', the director of MSF's Campaign for Access
to
Essential Medicines, Bernard Pécoul, states that "millions of
people in
developing countries are dying every year because the only drugs
available
to treat many infectious diseases are old, toxic or
ineffective." 
<P>
Nearly 10 percent of the global disease burden involves tropical
diseases,
but almost no new medicines are being developed, and drug
resistance is
making the drugs we do have useless, says Pécoul. <P>
The MSF report says that, of the 1,393 new medications approved
between 1975
and 1999, just 13 - or one percent - were aimed at treating
tropical
diseases, demonstrating the "dire lack of drug R&D into
unprofitable
diseases." <P>
"Drugs are not developed according to public health need, but
according to
profitability," said Pécoul. <P>
MSF is currently funding three pilot drug development projects on
drugs for
malaria, leishmaniasis and sleeping sickness, working in
partnership with
experts from Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia and Burkina Faso. <P>
The Global Forum for Health Research, which has the backing of the
World
Health Association (WHO), concludes its four-day sessions Friday.
