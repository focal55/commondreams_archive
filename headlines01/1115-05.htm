AFGHANISTAN south of Kabul was in turmoil yesterday as warlords and veteran commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle took advantage of the spectacular unraveling of the Taliban and resurfaced to reclaim power.
<p class="story">Just a day after the Northern Alliance broke its promise not to enter the liberated capital, the long-awaited uprising of the "Southern Alliance" began.</p>
<p class="story">But in many areas it seemed that opportunism was the only motivation. There were also signs of severe strains between the ethnic Pathan groups rising up in the south and the Northern Alliance, which is composed of minority ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="story">The Taliban withdrew with nominal resistance yesterday from the key eastern city of Jalalabad and surrounding provinces where homes and training camps of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qa'eda network were concentrated.</p>
<p class="story">He is almost certainly now in the south with the Taliban, which deserted Jalalabad, a trading post that lies at the end of the Khyber Pass and is the gateway to Pakistan.</p>
<p class="story">The Taliban appeared to be holding on to their southern stronghold of Kandahar last night amid reports of heavy fighting for the city and hundreds of defections.</p>
<p class="story">Opposition Pathan commanders were rallying thousands of tribesmen and attempting to lure Taliban defectors with a plea to Pathan unity after it was reported the Northern Alliance were advancing south.</p>
<p class="story">Mullah Najbullah, a Taliban official in the southern border town of Chaman, admitted that at least 200 Pathan fighters had mutinied and joined the forces of the southern opposition but there were no reports of any leading commanders switching sides.</p>
<p class="story">An American military official claimed last night that heavy fighting had been raging all day in Kandahar and its fall was imminent. The Taliban, however, said the city was calm, and Al Jazeera footage released by CNN showed quiet streets, disturbed only by pro-Taliban marches.</p>
<p class="story">Amid confusion about the nature of the battle for Kandahar, one leading opposition fighter predicted that the city would fall in days without bloodshed as a result of weeks of work within southern Afghanistan by opposition leaders to persuade Pathan tribesmen to rebel.</p>
<p class="story">Abdul Khaliq, the former Afghan consul in Quetta, said: "It is the end for them now. We have sent people to talk to the Taliban commanders to tell them not to fight against us. </p>
<p class="story">"Kandahar is still under their control but with the numbers of Pathans who are coming over to us we can do this without any fighting. Many of these commanders we have spoken to seem ready to join us."</p>
<p class="story">Pathans in the south resent the alliance's seizure of Kabul, believing that it is a recipe for civil war. Mr Khaliq said he had been deceived by the Northern Alliance.</p>
<p class="story">"I have been speaking to them in the last week. They assured me they would not take Kabul and then they do exactly that; we have no communications with them now."</p>
<p class="story">Despite the encouragement for the American-led forces, the day's successes created fears of factional feuding among the Pathan opposition that could undermine the country's political reconstruction. </p>
<p class="story">Three to four former leaders or commanders from the anti-Soviet struggle, all with their own tribal power bases in the east, were reportedly converging on Jalalabad yesterday.</p>
<p class="story">They may yet amicably agree on a power-sharing arrangement for the city. But Younis Khalis, an 80-year-old mujahideen leader who remained in Jalalabad throughout the Taliban's rule, has already reportedly proclaimed himself governor.</p>
<p class="story">He said he had liberated the city, capital of Nangarhar province, as his former fighters who had served under the Taliban for five years rejoined their old master and persuaded other Taliban to leave.</p>
<p class="story">A spokesman for Khalis said: "Neither the Northern Alliance nor anybody else should try to enter into Nangarhar."</p>
<p class="story">Neighboring Logar province fell to local commanders loyal to the notorious exiled warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, from whom Khalis broke away in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="story"> Forces of Hasrat Ali, a commander who maintained a pocket of armed resistance to the Taliban, reportedly took over Kunar province and immediately marched for Jalalabad.</p>
<p class="story">Ali is loyal not to Khalis but to Haji Abdul Qadir, the former governor of the city, who allegedly took a &pound;6.5 million bribe to surrender to the Taliban in September 1996.</p>
<p class="story">The Taliban deputy ambassador in Islamabad, Sohail Shaheen, the sole remaining envoy of the militia, said in the Pakistani capital Islamabad that their fighters were preparing a new strategy.</p>
<p class="story"> "We feared that fighting in the cities would bring great loss of life so a withdrawal was made. There is a regrouping and there will be a new program worked out," he said.</p>
<p class="story">Local newspapers reported that some Arabs and Taliban were heading for autonomous tribal areas in Pakistan to regroup for a guerrilla campaign.</p>
