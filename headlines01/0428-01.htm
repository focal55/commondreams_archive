<p> 

George Bush had an uncompromising message for the Washington cynics who claim that he is nothing more than Dick Cheney's front man. 'To these people, I say this,' the president began a speech last month. Then he looked at the man sitting further down the table and asked: `Well, Dick, what do I say?'
<P>  Self-deprecating humour is one of the favourite weapons of America's new president, who completes his first hundred days in office tomorrow. But the jokes cannot entirely conceal the truth. Mr Bush may have got the office and the title, but time and again it is Mr Cheney who does the work, who calls the shots and who sets the administration on its conservative course.
<P>  Having picked many members of the administration in December and January, he has now surrounded himself with a heavyweight staff of his own, installed himself at all the vital junctions of decision-making in the White House, and taken charge of key policy areas, including the federal budget and the energy policy review.
<P>  No important meeting on foreign policy takes place without his being present, and he is the administration's principal ambassador to Capitol Hill, where as vice-president he holds the casting vote in the evenly divided Senate. It is an unprecedented workload for a US vice-president, let alone one who has had four heart attacks and quadruple bypass surgery.
<P>  The job has come a long way since Vice-President John Nance Garner in the 1930s said it was 'not worth a bucket of warm spit'. It is a mark of Mr Cheney's importance that he has four separate Washington offices: one in the Senate, another in the House of Representatives, a third in the Old Executive Office Building, where most of his staff work, and one in the west wing of the White House, just down the corridor from the Oval Office.
<P>  None of this is obvious from the outside. Mr Bush's daily schedule is full of activities which keep him constantly in the public eye. Mr Cheney, by contrast, has few public engagements, makes virtually no speeches, gives only rare interviews (including one to Larry King last night), and keeps out of the limelight, 'never showing more surface than necessary' as the secretary of state, Colin Powell, describes it in his 1995 memoirs.
<P>  And this secret revolution has stunned friend and foe alike. Ronald Reagan's former chief of staff Ken Duberstein says it is 'the first time in our history we've had a president and a prime minister'. The Democratic congressman Robert Wexler just says: 'Dick Cheney is running the government'.
<P>  'To compare him to other vice-presidents is to diminish his real influence,' says Paul Light, the author of a book on the vice-presidency. 'He's really a chief of staff, the senior cabinet secretary, the chairman of the kitchen cabinet, the president's best friend and mentor, all rolled into one.'
<P>No one ever doubted that Mr Cheney would be a huge asset to the inexperienced Mr Bush. His time as Gerald Ford's chief of staff and George Bush Sr's defence secretary, plus his 10 years as an influential Republican congressman in the 1980s and his experience as chief executive of the Halliburton oil company from 1995, gave him an exceptional background.
<P>  It also helped that he had given up any thought of running for the presidency himself. In the past 50 years Spiro Agnew was the only elected vice-president who did not have a shot at the top job.
<P>  'You can play a very different role if you aren't running for president,' Mr Cheney's longstanding colleague Bob Teeter says. 'It means the president can entrust you with big things'.
<P>  The first proof of Mr Cheney's true importance came when Mr Bush sublet the entire presidential transition process to him in December. Mr Cheney's hand was soon seen in cabinet nominations, such as his old patron Donald Rumsfeld for defence secretary and his old colleague Paul O'Neill at the treasury.
<P>  Even so, few people would have been able to predict how central Mr Cheney has already become on policy issues. 'He's a lot stronger today than anybody anticipated when Bush picked him,' the Republican lobbyist Chuck Greener says.
<P>  For instance, no previous vice-president had such power over the government budget. Mr Cheney chaired the budget review board this spring, settling spending disputes between departments without ever referring them to Mr Bush.
<P>  No previous vice-president has had such a central role in national security policy either. Mr Cheney attends every 'principals' meeting' of the national security council and is one of the inner group, along with Mr Bush, the national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and the White House chief of staff Andy Card, which takes the final political decisions. And while Mr Cheney gets every security briefing that goes to his colleagues, he has also installed his own private national security team, headed by his chief of staff Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, which briefs him alone.
<P>  Mr Cheney was the key proponent of the two big policy reviews set in motion as soon as the administration took office. The first, on US defence needs, was entrusted to Mr Rumsfeld. The second, on US energy strategy, he has taken charge of himself.
<P>  When it is published in a few weeks time, the energy review may prove to be the defining document of the Bush years. It aims to establish policy on everything from nuclear power to oil drilling in protected lands and the future of international oil sanctions. It will set the stage for crucial battles between the energy industry and environmentalists.
<P>  It will recommend drilling in Alaska, a project Mr Cheney championed as a congressman 20 years ago, exploratory drilling to be allowed in more than 7.6m hectares (17m acres) of the Rocky Mountains, including the Lewis and Clark national forest in Montana, and an easing of air pollution controls.
<P>  It will raise the possibility of lifting US sanctions against Iran, Libya and possibly even Iraq. It will call on America to build dozens of power plants and reinvest in nuclear power. It will be a bonanza for an industry which gave more than $25m to the Republicans for last year's elections.
<P>  Everything about the energy review is classic Cheney. Like the president, Mr Cheney is an oil industry man. Before returning to politics he was chief executive of Halliburton, the biggest oil service company in the world, which itself has given $1.5m to the Republican party in the past10 years. Wherever there is oil - Iraq, China, Alaska - Halliburton has interests. Every decision that Mr Cheney's team takes about access to new energy supplies will have a bearing on the company, which provided him with an income of $36.1m last year alone.
<P><B> Mastermind</B>
<P>But Mr Cheney is more than just the architect of the administration and the mastermind of its policy direction. He is a fixture at the Senate Republican caucus's weekly strategy meetings, and when arms need to be twisted in the Senate and the House, he is the administration's chief negotiator and dealer.
<P>  'Any time there's a strategy session on scheduling and lobbying, he is in the middle of all that,' says Mike Frank of the conservative Heritage Foundation. 'He is a really key player at a substantive level, and not just because of the title he holds.'
<P>Conservatives are now preparing for him to play this role in what many see as the greatest battles of the next two years: the right wing's attempt to place its supporters in hundreds of judicial positions at all levels of the federal court system and, above all, to take firm control of the supreme court.
<P>  Or at least he will if his health holds out. Just over 10 years ago his wife Lynne wrote a novel called Body Politic, in which a 59-year-old vice-president dies of a heart attack while in bed with a television anchorwoman. Today, the health of the 60-year-old Mr Cheney's heart is a constant concern at every level of government.
<P>  Mr Bush, meanwhile, sticks to the jokes. 'Here are some of the headlines I'd like to see in the future,' he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 5. 'Cheney cloned: president has nothing to do at all now.'
