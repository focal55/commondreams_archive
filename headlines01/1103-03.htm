Historic shipwrecks and sunken cities will be protected against pillaging by treasure hunters by a convention adopted by <a href="http://www.unesco.org/" target="_new">UNESCO</a> yesterday. 
<P>The convention on the protection of underwater cultural heritage, which took four years to draw up, was adopted by the organization's 138 member states meeting in Paris yesterday.  
<P>Bitterly opposed by private salvage operators, and only partially backed by Europe's traditional seafaring nations, it outlaws the plundering of ancient shipwrecks and underwater archaeological sites: a source of rich and growing profits for treasure hunters at the expense of the world's heritage.  
<P>"Protecting our underwater heritage is extremely important and increasingly urgent, as no site or shipwreck is now out of bounds for treasure hunters," Lyndel Prott of UNESCO's cultural heritage division said.  
<P>"New technologies have made deep-water wrecks easily accessible."  
<P>UNESCO estimates that more than 3m undiscovered shipwrecks remain scattered across the world's ocean floors.  
<P>Even the figures for known wrecks are impressive: 65,000 off North America alone from the year 1500 to the present day, and 850 - including 90 Spanish galleons and 40 Portuguese Indiamen - off the Azores since 1522.  
<P>There are also whole cities, such as the trading town and pirate stronghold of Port Royal in Jamaica, which sank beneath the waves after an earthquake in 1692, and remnants of ancient civilizations, such as the Alexandrian lighthouse in Egypt and Neolithic villages under the Black Sea.  
<P>The rewards for commercial salvagers can be huge, UNESCO said. In 1985 an American treasure hunter, Mel Fisher, discovered a cargo of gold, silver and jewelry worth an estimated $400m (£275m) in the wreck of a Spanish galleon that sank off the Florida Keys in 1622.  
<P>In 1986 Christie's raised $16m at an auction of 3,786 lots of Chinese porcelain and gold ingots salvaged from a Dutch ship wrecked in the South China Sea in 1752, and in 1992 the sale of porcelain known as the "Vung Tao cargo", raised from a wreck off the southern coast of Vietnam, brought in almost $7.2m.  
<P>In Portugal alone at least six international treasure hunting companies have set up base to exploit the immensely rich underwater heritage off its coast, UNESCO said, and in the Philippines local fishermen are recruited to scour the seabed for wrecked Spanish galleons.  
<P>"An archaeologist can spend years studying and excavating a ship, conserving its objects and publishing his findings," Mounir Bouchenaki of UNESCO said.  
<P>"With treasure hunters, records are not kept and artifacts are spread around the world in private collections," he said. "This is tragic for humanity as a whole. Where there is no knowledge, there is no memory."   
<P>When a site was excavated properly, he added, everyone benefited. The archaeological survey of the Pandora, which sank in 1791 off the coast of Queensland, Australia, helped complete the story of the mutiny on the Bounty and the extraordinary search for the mutineers.  
<P>The convention, which will come into force once 20 countries have ratified it, is designed to fill a legal vacuum. Although many states already protect and manage historic wrecks and sites within their waters, those in international waters - such as the Titanic - are "basically up for grabs".  
<P>It defines underwater cultural heritage as "all traces of human existence of a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water for at least 100 years".  
<P>States will have the authority to punish offenders and seize any illegally recovered treasure that comes to light on their territory.  
<P>The International Salvage Union (ISU) says this conflicts with existing treaties, including the 1982 law of the sea.  
<P>"There are many examples of owners exerting their right   to ownership of submerged objects long after 100 years," Archie Bishop, an adviser to the ISU, said.  
<P>"The convention might have a run-on effect in current law on ownership and an owner's right to his property."  
<P>Salvage operators are also worried about a clause demanding that underwater cultural heritage should be preserved where it lies.  
<P>They say this could condemn treasures to decay, and that they could be held liable if a historic site is inadvertently damaged during a legal salvage operation. 
<P>
<B>Secrets of the deep</B>
<P>The oceans cover seven-tenths of the planet. They also wash over the debris of 5,000 years of settled human history. But only with the development of scuba diving and mobile submersibles capable of withstanding fierce pressures miles below the surface have we been able to look at the largest unexplored area on earth. 
<P>Last year researchers discovered an ancient shoreline now submerged by the Black Sea, which was dubbed "the landscape of Noah's flood". They also identified Canopus and Herakleion, two "vanished" cities of Egypt drowned in a Nile flood.  
<P>Researchers are still tantalized by the legend of Atlantis, described in Plato. In September a scientist identified it as an archipelago drowned by rising sea levels at the end of the ice age.  
<P>But the most dramatic prizes lie in ancient sunken shipping. Robert Ballard, who found the Titanic, has discovered five ships of the Roman period settled in soft Mediterranean mud.</p>
