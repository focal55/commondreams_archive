Even before Friday's devastating suicide bombing of a nightclub queue in Tel Aviv - the worst such outrage against Jews in five years - the mood among hawks in the Cabinet of Ariel Sharon had been turning to thoughts of all-out war. <P>Four car bombs in the past week and a series of shootings of Israeli settlers had marked an upsurge in Palestinian violence in the worst month for Israeli fatalities in the Occupied Territories since November.  <P>It was on the mind of Brigadier-General Yisrael Ziv when he called in the defence correspondents of Israel's press for a briefing at the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv early last week.  <P>Within the heavily guarded complex off one of Tel Aviv's main streets, Ziv - senior officer in charge of Israel's infantry and paratroop brigades - told the journalists that Israel was 'not so far removed' from full-scale war.  <P>He was not, he assured them, making a prediction. It was simply his job to 'prepare for that eventuality'. It may have come sooner than even Ziv expected.  <P>The bombing outside the Pacha nightclub killed 17 people, all but one of them recent Russian immigrants, and wounded scores of others. It could not have come at a worse time, in the middle of an urgent debate in Sharon's Cabinet over whether the time had come to reject international calls for restraint and prepare for a proper war.   <P>Within 24 hours of Ziv's briefing - and still before Friday's bomb - Israel's Defence Minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, had announced that the Israel Defence Force's presence on the West Bank would be strengthened by special ambush units to protect the bypasses used by Jewish settlers.  <P>To add to the febrile mood of crisis, Shin Bet - the Israeli security service - also weighed in, summoning correspondents for a briefing that purported to demonstrate how senior figures in Arafat's police were involved in the manufacture, arming and use of mortars being fired into Jewish areas.  <P>Other senior army officers were briefing off the record   too. Israel's two-week-old unilateral ceasefire, they said, was an 'operational halt' in an 'ongoing war', a chance for its soldiers to draw breath and prepare for the task ahead.  <P>They added that they were waiting for the political green light from Sharon - who came to power in January promising to guarantee Israelis a new security - for a new offensive in the Territories if the Palestinians did not respond with their own cessation of violence.  <P>What that offensive might entail has been spelled out in recent days by members of Sharon's security Cabinet, including the hardline Housing Minister Natan Sharansky. He said last week: 'We are in a war where we are not using our strength. I am not saying reconquer Gaza, but we need to fight with all the strength we have against the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian Authority.'  <P>Former Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu - Sharon's rival for leadership of the Right - has been hardly less equivocal. 'Israel,' he told the Jerusalem Post last week, 'should concentrate its might to eliminate terror infrastructure - to strike radio, television, media, transportation, gas, and weapons reserves, and the PA's economic infrastructure.  <P>'We have not yet used 1 per cent of the power of the IDF. If Arafat continues the terror we will make sure that his terrorist regime will collapse. It is to this end that a unity gov ernment was formed, and it will receive tremendous backing for its actions.'  <P>Yesterday the hardliners appeared to have won the day. After a seven-hour emergency Cabinet meeting - remarkable for being held on the Sabbath - leading Cabinet members indicated that Israel was about to end its policy of restraint.  <P>And whatever group was ultimately behind the Pacha bombing, one thing is certain: it has played into the hands of those like Sharansky who only supported the Sharon ceasefire for the most cynical of reasons: that it would 'reveal to the world who was really responsible for the violence'.  <P>The key question now is whether the international community can persuade Sharon to stay his hand and prevent more carnage.  <P>The new Bush administration has already fumbled the issue of its engagement in the Middle East, notably failing to persuade Arafat to respond to the Israeli ceasefire with his own truce, despite the intervention of Secretary of State Colin Powell.  <P>In Britain, Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook - in common with other EU leaders - have called for restraint. There is little evidence of any meaningful intervention.  <P>The immediate response of Arafat, under intense pressure from the Americans and also from the visiting German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, was to condemn the bombing and commit Palestinians to do their utmost to implement a ceasefire in the conflict with Israel.  <P>His offer was rejected by Israeli Cabinet Ministers, who said they would not take it seriously unless Arafat arrested Islamic militants.   <P>While Sharon and others on the right blame Arafat for orchestrating the violence, the truth is that both sides may have now gone too far to turn back.  <P>Analysts are dubious about the amount of control Arafat can actually exert over the suicide bombers of Islamic Jihad and Hamas, whose leaders he released from his prisons at the beginning of the  intifada .  <P>'When he released Islamic extremists from the Palestinian prisons,' said one Western diplomat, 'he opened a Pandora's box. He may find it impossible to close it.' <P><B> Palestinian attacks since the peace accord in 1993:</B>  <P><B> 1 June 2001:</B> Suicide bomber blows up himself and 16 Israelis outside a Tel Aviv nightclub.  <P><B> 30 July 1997:</B> Two suicide bombers kill themselves and 15 others at a Jerusalem market.  <P><B> 4 September 1997:</B> Explosion in west Jerusalem kills eight.  <P><B> 30 July 1997:</B> Two suicide bombers kill themselves and 16 shoppers in Jerusalem market.  <P><B> 4 March 1996:</B> Suicide bomber kills 14 people outside a Tel Aviv mall.  <P><B> 3 March 1996:</B> Suicide bomb on a Jerusalem bus kills 18.  <P><B> 25 February 1996:</B> Suicide bombings in a Jerusalem bus and Ashkelon soldiers' post kill 24 Israelis, two Americans and a Palestinian.  <P><B> 21 August 1995:</B> Bomb on a Jerusalem bus kills five.  <P><B> 24 July 1995:</B> Suicide bomber kills six passengers and himself on a bus outside Tel Aviv.  <P><B> 9 April 1995:</B> Suicide bomber attacks convoy in Gaza, killing seven Israeli soldiers and a tourist.  <P><B> 22 January 1995:</B> Two suicide bombers kill 21 in central Israel.  <P><B> 19 October 1994:</B> Suicide bomber kills 23 on a Tel Aviv bus.  <P><B> 6 April 1994:</B> Car bomb in Afula kills nine and wounds 44.<p align="center">&copy; Guardian Newspapers Limited 2001</p>
