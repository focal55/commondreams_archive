CALIFORNIA CITY, Calif. -- Like pioneers from an earlier time, 
<a href="http://www.correctionscorp.com/" target="_new">Corrections Corp. of America</a> nearly met its demise here in the Mojave 
Desert.

<p>
The private-prison operator spent $106 million in 1998 to build a 
giant prison in the sand, confident it would land a contract to house 
California prisoners. What CCA officials didn't anticipate, however, 
was a sudden stall in the growth of California's prison population 
and fierce opposition from unionized state prison guards worried 
about their jobs. The prison remained empty and helped push CCA, then 
struggling with management problems and mounting debt, to the brink 
of financial disaster.

<p>The company's desperation should have presented an opportunity to 
Uncle Sam. While state prison populations appeared to be leveling 
off, the head counts in federal prisons were growing more rapidly 
than ever, fueled by tougher drug and immigration laws. The <a href="http://www.bop.gov/" target="_new">U.S. 
Bureau of Prisons</a> needed more beds, and the empty prison here offered 
immediately available capacity. Presumably, the bureau could 
negotiate a fire-sale price.

<p><b>Bonanza for CCA</b>

</table></font>As it turned out, the contract signed last year was a bonanza for 
CCA. The Bureau of Prisons agreed to pay above-market prices and, on 
top of that, big cash bonuses if the company achieved vaguely defined 
performance targets.

<p>Most important, the Bureau of Prisons guaranteed CCA a 95% occupancy 
rate -- an arrangement almost never included in state private-prison 
contracts, which typically base payment on the number of beds 
actually filled. Here in California City, the federal government 
agreed to pay for 95% of the beds, whether it needs them or not. For 
now, the prison is full, but the guarantee provides important 
insurance if demand flags again.

<p>The government didn't stop with CCA, which sparked the creation of 
the private-prison market nearly 20 years ago and now commands 52% of 
it. Of the five private prisons now operating under contract with the 
Bureau of Prisons, three belong to CCA and two to <a href="http://www.wackenhut.com/" target="_new">Wackenhut 
Corrections Corp.</a>, the industry's No. 2 player, which has had its own 
financial problems. All of the contracts are generous by conventional 
industry standards, as they include occupancy guarantees and 
long-term renewal options.

<p>What's more, the Bureau of Prisons is expected in coming months to 
announce additional similarly structured private-prison deals, 
involving a total of 6,000 beds and more than $1 billion in potential 
revenue over time. The bureau's offer of occupancy guarantees is "the 
reason why we're so excited about the federal side," Steven Logan, 
chairman and chief executive of <a href="http://www.abraxasgroup.com/" target="_new">Cornell Cos.</a>, the No. 3 publicly 
traded prison company, told Wall Street analysts in June. Federal 
officials, he added, "cut you that check every month," whether or not 
the cells are full.

<p>For more than three years, the private-prison business has been 
floundering. A decade-long prison-building boom among states has 
slowed markedly, while bad publicity about escapes and violence at 
certain for-profit lockups has raised questions about the companies' 
competence.

<p>Now, even as the national economy slogs through a recession and a 
disaster-era federal budget tightens, Washington is effectively 
throwing the industry a life preserver.

<p>The Bureau of Prisons says its purpose isn't to rescue CCA and the 
other companies. Bureau officials at first resisted the push for 
privatization during the mid-1990s by the Clinton administration and 
Congress. And bureau officials still disagree with the industry 
contention that outsourcing prisons saves taxpayers money.

<p>In fact, the federal prison agency's ambivalence over privatization 
helps explain why it has been so generous to the prison companies. 
Forced by higher political authorities to do business with the 
industry, a proud and reluctant U.S. prison bureaucracy has embraced 
the idea that to replicate its own high standards, it has to pay the 
private sector a premium.

<p><b>Expensive Experiment

</b>
<p>If privatization at the federal level turns out to be an expensive 
experiment, the chances that Congress or the White House would push 
for broad-scale outsourcing of federal prisons would diminish. The 
public system would survive largely intact, and public employees 
would keep their jobs.

<p>Bureau officials say privatization gives them more flexibility to 
deal with surges in particular inmate populations, such as illegal 
immigrants. "We don't sit around and strategize how we can make the 
contractors look bad or look more expensive," Michael Janus, the 
bureau's outsourcing chief, says.

<p>Asked to explain the above-market contracts and bonuses, he responds 
that "price is way down on the list" of factors important to his 
agency. The federal government, he adds, wants the best prisons, not 
necessarily the cheapest.

<p>It doesn't hurt relations between the companies and the federal 
government that CCA and Wackenhut have hired numerous former Bureau 
of Prisons officials, including those who now serve as wardens of all 
five of the federal prisons that have been privatized so far. A 
Bureau of Prisons spokesman says the hiring of former officials has 
no bearing on contracting decisions.

<p>For their part, CCA officials say that at California City they are 
providing an almost-new facility and top-notch services that merit 
premium pay. Even with the recent addition of five private prisons to 
the federal government's 100 publicly owned and operated facilities, 
the federally run lockups still have more inmates overall than their 
stated capacity. "We think [the Bureau of Prisons] could probably use 
us more," says CCA's chief executive, John Ferguson.

<p>Since CCA opened its pioneering private prison in Tennessee in 1984, 
government use of such facilities has been controversial. Critics 
argue that only officials accountable to the public should be trusted 
with the welfare of inmates.

<p>But prisons cost a fortune -- $50 million and up, as a rule of thumb 
-- and private industry long had argued that it could house and 
manage prisoners less expensively than government. By 1997, CCA, 
based in Nashville, Tenn., had 47 prisons, healthy profits and a 
soaring stock price.

<p>Encouraged by a national trend toward locking up more drug felons for 
longer periods of time, CCA built prisons based on speculation that 
states would rent space in them. In 1998, it acted "on spec" when it 
put up the one here in California City.

<p>But then trouble struck. After California's prison population jumped 
by 22% from 1993 to 1996, the growth rate began to slow -- to 3.9% in 
1998 and then to only 0.7% in 1999. That made the state a less-eager 
potential customer. Resistance from the politically potent 
prison-guard union, which feared privatization of public-sector jobs, 
ended any hope that state inmates would fill the California City 
facility.

<p>And CCA was having difficulties elsewhere. A rash of inmate escapes 
and guard-brutality cases led to harsh media attention and 
contributed to jitters on Wall Street about prison companies' stock. 
In one of the most-notorious examples, two inmates were killed by 
other inmates and six escaped from a medium-security CCA prison in 
Ohio during separate incidents in 1998.

<p>Privatization opponents pointed to such events as evidence that the 
industry was incompetent or negligent. CCA and its rivals countered 
that the incidents illustrated only isolated problems and that, on 
the whole, private prisons are on a par with public.

<p>Meanwhile, CCA's financial management was faltering. Long-term debt 
taken on to finance its building boom climbed to $1.09 billion in 
1999, from $127 million only two years earlier. The company began 
losing money -- $730 million in 2000. Its stock dropped to $4.50 a 
share in 1999, from nearly $45 in 1997. In 2000, it fell as low as 19 
cents.

<p>As states around the country began to ease the Draconian sentencing 
laws that helped the industry get established in the first place, the 
future looked bleak for CCA. The one ray of hope came from Washington.

<p>Founded in 1930, the Bureau of Prisons remains in the shadow of its 
parent agency, the U.S. Justice Department. But the BOP, as it's 
known in Washington, prides itself on being the class operation in 
its field.

<p>The BOP had resisted suggestions from the Clinton administration that 
the federal government privatize prisons. "The BOP was adamantly 
opposed to it," says a former career Justice Department official 
involved in internal discussions about privatization. "Although they 
would never say it," the official adds, "I think they were afraid of 
the camel's nose," meaning that even a small move toward 
privatization could lead to the eventual outsourcing of most federal 
prison work.

<p>In a July 1999 "Message to All Bureau of Prisons Employees Regarding 
Privatization," the agency's director, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, tried to 
reassure subordinates that they weren't going to lose their jobs to 
privatization. For one thing, she wrote, the prison companies hadn't 
"established an acceptable track record" for "the incarceration of 
medium- or high-security inmates."

<p>Nevertheless Clinton administration officials intent on "reinventing" 
government did see privatization as a means of holding down the 
growth in the BOP's work force, which had nearly doubled during the 
1980s, to 19,000 employees. In 1995, as part of his budget proposal 
to Congress for the next fiscal year, President Clinton said his 
administration planned to privatize the management and operations "of 
most future federal [prison] facilities under construction."

<p>This proposal was enthusiastically received in Congress, where CCA, 
Wackenhut and Cornell were lobbying for broader privatization. From 
1995 to 2000, the three companies made a total of more than $528,000 
in federal campaign contributions -- much of it in "soft money" given 
to the political parties, according to the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org" target="_new">Center for Responsive 
Politics</a>, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C.

<p>The Justice Department, acting on behalf of the BOP, continued to 
raise safety concerns about privatization, but the momentum was too 
strong. A Republican-controlled Senate appropriations subcommittee 
put language in a spending bill in 1996, directing the BOP to launch 
its first privately operated prison, in Taft, Calif. A spokesman for 
Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the subcommittee chairman at the 
time, declines to comment.

<p>The bureau had little choice but to comply. It hired Wackenhut for 
the job. Congress intervened again in 1997, ordering the BOP to take 
responsibility for certain inmates in Washington, D.C.'s corrections 
system.

<p>The BOP didn't warm quickly to privatization. "We did not pursue this 
change in the Bureau's approach to private contracting," Dr. Sawyer, 
a BOP veteran who holds a doctorate in counseling and rehabilitation, 
wrote in her 1999 memorandum.

<p>She noted that "private prison companies often seek business by 
promising to federal and state legislators that they can provide 
comparable services at a reduced cost." These industry claims "have 
not been proven," she stated. But "we cannot ignore them. Some 
legislators and other policymakers are convinced the cost savings are 
real."

<p>The BOP opposed broad privatization but recognized that many in 
Congress viewed outsourcing as a thrifty strategy. Meanwhile, the 
federal-prison population was expanding rapidly.

<p>By the end of the 1990s, declining rates of violent and property 
crime, combined with some easing of state sentencing laws, 
contributed to an apparent leveling off in state prison head counts. 
But the opposite was happening in the smaller federal system. Harsher 
federal drug-sentencing laws enacted in the 1980s kept tens of 
thousands of inmates in federal prisons for longer terms. And tough 
immigration legislation in 1996 led to sharp increases in the arrest 
and incarceration of so-called criminal aliens.

<p>Last year, the federal inmate population expanded at a brisk 7.5% 
rate, to a total of 145,416. BOP officials say they had no choice but 
to go along with additional outsourcing to handle some of the growth.

<p>But, Dr. Sawyer wrote in her 1999 memo, "we must be cost-competitive 
with the private-sector companies in order to argue against further 
congressional mandates for privatization." One way she has done that 
is cutting the BOP's own costs.

<p>Another factor that has helped keep the BOP cost-competitive with the 
private sector is the relatively high cost of the bureau's 
private-prison contracts.

<p>The BOP's approach to determining how much to pay prison contractors 
indicated a remarkable solicitousness toward the industry's financial 
concerns. The bureau's Mr. Janus says that the agency held two rounds 
of "interchange" meetings with industry representatives, the first in 
1995 and the second about two years ago. The bureau organized the 
meetings, which were private and held with one company at a time, 
because it was "searching for ideas of mutual benefit to both the 
government and contracting community," he says.

<p>Marvin H. Wiebe, senior vice president for government affairs with 
Cornell, says the meeting he attended in late 1998 or early 1999 at 
the BOP's Washington office, was "outstanding, phenomenal." He 
recalls that as many as 10 bureau officials listened as he outlined 
the contracting terms his company would like to see in federal-prison 
contracts. "We were asking for 100% occupancy" guaranteed, he says. 
"And they came back with what I thought was a very fair and creative 
plan, which is that they guaranteed 95% occupancy."

<p>Louise Green, a spokeswoman for CCA, says employees currently with 
the company "didn't have any conversations" of this sort with the 
BOP, although ex-employees may have. Wackenhut employees attended 
meetings with bureau officials, says Margaret Pearson, a company 
spokeswoman. But the company declines to make those employees 
available or comment further.

<p>BOP officials decline to discuss in detail why they went along with 
the industry's suggestion of occupancy guarantees, sometimes known as 
take-or-pay provisions. In a written statement responding to 
questions on the topic, the bureau says: "In formulating our 
approach, we solicited input from the corrections industry and other 
independent correctional experts. Based on our own data and feedback 
from the private-corrections industry, we determined that payment for 
95% of designated capacity was appropriate."

<p>Mr. Janus adds that paying for the exclusive use of an entire prison 
gives the federal government more leverage in determining how a 
facility is managed. That reasoning is roughly akin to that of a 
company that rents an entire hotel for a conference, instead of just 
the rooms its employees occupy -- an analogy that Mr. Janus accepts.

<p>As an additional plum, the BOP promised companies substantial bonuses 
for "optimum performance" in three areas: overall work quality, 
responsiveness and management of "quality-control" programs.

<p>The idea of awarding performance bonuses and agreeing to take-or-pay 
guarantees startles some state-prison officials, who otherwise 
generally express respect for their federal counterparts. Montana, 
for example, offers neither take-or-pay nor bonuses to CCA, which 
operates a 500-bed medium-security prison in the town of Shelby. "We 
expect them to do a good job," says Pat Smith, contracting chief for 
the Montana Department of Corrections. "If they don't, we fire them."

<p>Asked whether any CCA customers, other than the federal government, 
provide bonus payments, company spokesman Steven M. Owen says, "I'm 
not aware of any that come to mind." None of Wackenhut's state 
contracts has bonus provisions, either, says Ms. Pearson.

<p>Apart from financial considerations, the BOP didn't see the highly 
publicized incidents of violence or escapes at some private prisons 
as an obstacle to hiring the industry. The bureau's Mr. Janus says 
those kinds of events happen periodically in all prison systems, 
including the BOP.

<p>Still, the bureau shares the view of many private-prison skeptics 
that the industry lacks sufficient competence to handle medium- and 
high-security inmates. That is why the BOP limited its private 
contracts to only the least-risky inmates, those classified as low- 
or minimum-security, Mr. Janus says. Most inmates in the bureau's 
growing population of criminal aliens fall into those categories.

<p>In the fall of 1999, the BOP sought industry proposals for housing 
criminal-alien prisoners in the Southwest. CCA put in the winning 
proposal.

<p>In June 2000, with CCA losing money and its California City facility 
sitting empty, the BOP awarded the company the biggest contract in 
private-prison history. Covering both California City and a second 
CCA facility in Cibola County, N.M., the deal promised the company a 
minimum of $68.7 million a year in revenue, the equivalent of 22% of 
CCA's total 2000 revenue. The deal, which spanned three years, with 
seven one-year options to renew, could be worth $760 million over the 
10-year period. The day it was announced, CCA's stock rose 56%.

<p>Almost all of the roughly 2,300 criminal aliens held at the 
California City prison have been convicted of one of three offenses: 
illegal entry into the country, illegal re-entry, or possession or 
trafficking of drugs. As low- and minimum-security inmates, they are 
less expensive to guard than more-dangerous prisoners, who require 
greater security.

<p>Yet the BOP agreed to pay an annual average of $21,880 per inmate at 
California City, or slightly more than the $21,601 the agency spends, 
on average, throughout the entire federal system, including medium- 
and high-security inmates.

<p>As a result of its occupancy guarantees, the BOP sometimes pays more 
than the $21,880 average. California City is fully occupied now. But 
as of Oct. 11, at its sister CCA prison in Cibola County, N.M., 877 
of 961 beds under contract -- 91% -- were occupied. The cost of 
paying for the extra 4%, to fulfill its take-or-pay guarantee, has 
hiked the BOP's annualized per-prisoner cost at Cibola to $23,777 -- 
10% higher than the average cost at BOP-run prisons overall.

<p>The BOP has included the 95% guarantee in all five of its existing 
private prisons, three of which are operating below capacity. Future 
federal-prison contracts are also expected to include such guarantees.

<p>The good news for CCA doesn't end there. In May, the company learned 
it would receive a $520,000 bonus for its successful operation of the 
prison at California City and a third facility it operates for the 
BOP, at Eloy, Ariz. For a company that had a loss of $5.3 million for 
the first quarter this year, that's a significant amount.

<p>As set out in the written BOP contract, the objective of the bonus 
"is to afford the contractor an opportunity to earn [an] increased 
fee commensurate with the achievement of the optimum performance." 
Unofficially, says Mr. Janus, "it avoids the haggling that sometimes 
takes place in a contractual negotiation." Since privatization of 
federal prisons began in 1997, the BOP says it has paid a total of 
$2.3 million in bonuses to CCA and Wackenhut.

<p>A look at what states pay private prisons makes CCA's federal 
contract look even richer. Here in California City, the company 
receives $57.48 per inmate a day at full occupancy. In Mississippi, 
by contrast, CCA gets just $28.29 a head a day. In Idaho, it gets 
$37.60; in Montana, $51.59.

<p>"Do we pay a little bit more?" asks the BOP's Mr. Janus. "Probably. 
But I think we get a better service."

<p>By service, Mr. Janus says, he means a range of things, from the 
recreational programs a prison offers inmates to how accommodating it 
is in meeting BOP requests. For instance, he says, the occupancy 
guarantees and bonuses ensure that when the BOP doubles to 80 from 40 
the number of prisoners it delivers to California City during a 
particular week, CCA won't grumble.

The government values another kind of flexibility, as well, he adds. 
Rather than financing construction of new prisons for criminal 
aliens, the BOP has committed itself to only three years of service 
at California City. After that, if illegal immigration eases or there 
is a move to legalize some of those who have entered the country 
unlawfully, the BOP can walk away from the private prison.

<p>At the California City facility, 120 miles northeast of Los Angeles, 
Warden Percy Pitzer says that high on the list of services that 
warrant generous pay is inmate rehabilitation. In the hobby-craft 
room, for instance, inmates spend their days at plywood tables making 
elaborate jewelry boxes from toothpicks and Popsicle sticks. In an 
indication of how rarely violence is a problem here, the inmates are 
allowed to use razor-blade-equipped box cutters in their craft work.

<p>Privatization of federal prisons will continue to expand, the BOP 
predicts. CCA's Mr. Ferguson says he very much looks forward to more 
federal contracts. "We treasure the Bureau," he says.
