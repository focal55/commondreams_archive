Vowing to redefine patriotism, thousands of peace activists rallied in 
San Francisco and Washington yesterday to mourn American terror victims -- and 
to urge the nation to work to heal the poverty and injustice that fuels global 
violence instead of focusing on military revenge.

</table></font>No one in the festive Dolores Park throng, which spanned all ages and 
colors, defended the suicidal jetliner attacks that left nearly 6,500 dead or 
missing. Instead, speakers blasted all forms of violence and injustice: the 
backlash against Arab Americans, embargos aimed at Iraq and Afghanistan 
tyrants that punish innocent women and children, and a federal anti-terror 
campaign that threatens American civil rights.
<P>"We are in pain. It is a great tragedy that all of us have witnessed," 
Pakistani writer Zulfikhar Ahmad told the crowd.
<P>If a U.S. attack on terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan kills innocent 
civilians, it could inflame anti-American fervor in the Islamic world, he said.
<P>"I am very afraid that there is a very big tragedy in the making and it will 
be the biggest dishonor to the memory of 6,000 innocent people who have died."
<P>The rally was a multigenerational family affair for Marilyn Griffith, 
69, and her daughter Tory, 40, who have been demonstrating together since a 7-
year-old Tory used to ride on her mother's shoulder at Vietnam War protests.
<P>"We want to reclaim the imagery of patriotism," said Tory, 40, a political 
organizer and theatrical producer with the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
<P>"Peace is patriotic," her mom chimed in. "Patriotism doesn't mean you don't 
speak out."
<P>The passionate but upbeat rally -- estimated at 7,000 to 10,000 -- bounced 
to the bountiful rhythms of Aztec warrior dancers and hip-hop rappers, Dixie 
Land jazz and the high-pitched Arab ululation. Later the drum-beating, bell-
banging crowd marched through the Mission District, carrying a giant, jug-
eared President Bush puppet and signs proclaiming, "Vengeance Is Not Justice" 
and "Save American Lives By Stopping U.S. Aggression Abroad."
<P>Chanting in a poetic rhythm, Arab American activist Eman Desouky said: 
'I am frightened for my people, ya'll. . . . As the noose tightens around Arab 
civil liberties, as the FBI begins to round us up, we stand in fierce 
solidarity with our Japanese American brothers and sisters who have suffered 
and resisted the internment camps of the 1940s.
<P>"As Arabs (and) Muslims get kicked off airplanes, as our homes are 
vandalized, as our children are terrorized, we stand in fierce solidarity with 
the African Americans who suffered and continue to suffer through the ugly 
history of racism in this country."
<P>In Washington, more than 3,000 people gathered to march in the name of 
peace.
<P>"Even our friends have said this is not a time to speak," said Mara 
Verheyden-Hillard of the Partnership for Civil Justice. "But we will not be 
silenced."
<P>Many of the Washington protesters originally had planned to be in town this 
weekend for much larger demonstrations at the annual meeting of the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund.
<P>When those meetings were called off after the terrorist attacks on New York 
and Washington, the focus of those protests was quickly changed. Nonetheless, 
about 1,000 demonstrators, many of them clad in black and wearing bandannas 
over their faces, marched through Washington to the World Bank headquarters 
yesterday, shouting anti-capitalist slogans.
<P>"We're here to stop the war on the poor," said Jan, a protester from 
Richmond, Va.
<P>Hundreds of police officers in full riot gear shadowed the march, closing 
off streets and keeping the demonstrators from straying off their route. Once 
at the World Bank, police sealed off the square, trapping the demonstrators 
there for more than an hour.
<P>"This is a peaceful, patriotic march and we're being treated like criminals,
" said a protester from Bethesda, who gave her name only as Heather.
<P>The protesters' original plan had been to surround the White House or 
demonstrate in nearby Lafayette Park, but the Secret Service and Park Police 
turned down those options. The protest leaders finally decided to gather for a 
three-hour rally and then march to a park near the Capitol building.
<P>"I call on our government to refrain from bringing the suffering we have 
endured (from the terrorist attacks) to other innocent people," said Eleiza 
Braun, a student activist from George Washington University. "There has to be 
an end to hate, an end to the cycle of violence."
