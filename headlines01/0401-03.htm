OTTAWA -- Canadian immigration officials have put out an all-points bulletin to try to keep Jos&#233; Bov&#233;, the French farmer who gained notoriety for trashing a McDonald's, from attending next month's Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.
<P>A spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada told The Globe and Mail yesterday that a notice has been sent to all the country's ports of entry, warning staff to be on the lookout for Mr. Bov&#233;.</P>

French Farmer Jose Bove's demolition of a McDonald's restaurant is merely the most dramatic event in a long career opposing the forces of agribusiness and multinationals.<br>

&#34;It's just another example of how our civil liberties are being suspended,&#34; said Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the nationalist Council of Canadians, the group that had asked Mr. Bov&#233; to speak in Quebec City. &#34;He speaks for millions of people, for farmers and landless peasants.&#34;
<P>The moustachioed sheep farmer became something of a Robin Hood figure after he and four others were imprisoned for vandalizing a McDonald's and locking up agricultural officials in France.</P>
<P>Attacking the fast-food chain, he said, was a symbolic gesture to protest against the rise of genetically modified foods, as well as against tariffs imposed by the United States on French delicacies such as Roquefort cheese and <I>foie gras</I>.</P>
<P>He was fined and sentenced to three months in prison, but is currently out on appeal.</P>
<P>Since the incident, Mr. Bov&#233; has emerged as one of the most notorious members of the protest movement that has hit several international gatherings in recent years, including the 1999 World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle that were effectively shut down by street demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
    Mr. Bov&#233; recently predicted that the Quebec summit -- a gathering of 34 heads of state and government from across North and South America -- would generate a protest that would make the Seattle street battle pale in comparison.</P>
<P>Tens of thousands of protesters are expected to descend on Quebec City for the April 20-22 summit to show their opposition to a proposed so-called free-trade area of the Americas (FTAA) that would include every country in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba.</P>
<P>Immigration spokesman Richard St. Louis said Mr. Bov&#233; would be kept out of Canada because of his conviction related to the McDonald's incident.</P>
<P>&#34;There is a lookout for Mr. Bov&#233; because he is technically inadmissible to Canada . . . he has a criminal background,&#34; Mr. St. Louis said.</P>
<P>Those with a criminal record cannot enter Canada without a special ministerial permit. However, Mr. St. Louis acknowledged the bulletin specifically advising customs officers to keep an eye out for Mr. Bov&#233; was unusual and tied to his stated intention to attend the summit.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening, American activist George Lakey -- who is to give a keynote speech on non-violent protest at a planned event tomorrow on Parliament Hill -- was detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian airport officials for four hours while authorities questioned him about what he would be doing while in Canada.</P>
<P>Mr. Lakey said after his release that the search of his belongings reminded him of the old Communist East Germany. He said Customs officials ran his name through a computer, then did an extensive search of his bags.
