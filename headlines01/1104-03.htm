PORTLAND, Maine --
        

        A campaign to make Maine the first state with universal health care faces an important test of public opinion next week amid a TV ad blitz waged against the idea by the insurance industry.
<p>A nonbinding resolution on Tuesday's ballot in Portland calls on the city to encourage government-run health care for everyone.
<p>Maine already has experimented with ways to cut health care costs and expand coverage. The state forced drug discounts under threat of price controls, and it obtained a federal Medicaid waiver that allows it to raise the minimum incomes that determine eligibility for discounted drugs. Duncan Wright, a Portland psychiatrist helping to run the campaign for universal health care, suggested Maine is a good candidate to lead the way.
<p>"We're a rural state, we're not wealthy, but we have a humane political tradition. I think we can do it. We can be the first," he said.
<p>A study last year concluded that 165,000 Maine residents--13%--lack health insurance and that the state's percentage of uninsured adults is the highest in New England.
<p>Saying private insurance is unfair and inefficient, reformers believe Portland can send a strong message in support of a Canadian-style single-payer system that provides comprehensive, high-quality care to everyone.
<p>Under a single-payer plan, a public agency would collect health care premiums and pay bills for all state residents.
<p>Advocates acknowledge that such a program would require higher taxes, mostly for higher-income residents, but say people would not pay much more than they do now for private insurance, and everyone would be covered.
<p>Supporters of a single-payer system have traditionally directed their efforts at the federal government, but some are beginning to view the states as more receptive.
<p>Opponents acknowledge that Maine's current system is imperfect, but they caution that scrapping it in favor of a government-run health care system would raise taxes and limit consumer choice.
<p>"This is the first salvo in a statewide battle. If we defeat it here, it will send a clear message," said Daryn Demeritt, campaign coordinator for Citizens for Sensible Health Care Choices, whose biggest contributor is Anthem, Maine's largest health insurer.
<p>State lawmakers rejected a proposal last year to create a $3.4-billion single-payer system administered by the state. Instead, the Legislature created a board to study the issue and submit a report by March.
<p>The proposal's sponsor, Democratic state Rep. Paul Volenik, said the Portland referendum shows that the single-payer issue is beginning to resonate at the local level.
<p>"Just the fact that the insurance industry is putting a lot of money into television ads shows that they're worried about this," Volenik said. "Win or lose, it's a wake-up call for the people."
<p>Campaign finance reports filed this week with the city show that opponents raised more than $382,000 as of Oct. 25. Supporters collected less than $1,500 during the same period.
<p align="left">That level of spending is unusual in a place where $500,000 is enough to mount a serious congressional campaign, said Oliver Woshinsky, a political science professor at the University of Southern Maine.
<p>"It's one little city voting on an advisory referendum," he said. "This just shows you what's at stake here."
