WASHINGTON  - Two environmental groups on
Wednesday raised concerns about a 1996 speech by
President-elect George W. Bush's designated interior secretary,
Gale Norton, in which she likened the struggle to preserve
states' rights to the cause of the Confederacy and said ``We
lost too much'' when the South was defeated in the Civil War.
<p>In the speech to the Independence Institute, a conservative
think tank in Denver, Norton, who was then Colorado's attorney
general, described slavery as ``bad facts'' that undermined the
South's struggle for state sovereignty.
<p>She also described her intention -- later dropped -- to sue
the federal government for forcing Colorado to add a wheelchair
ramp to the statehouse under the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) of 1990, calling it ``a really ugly addition to the
state capitol.''
<p>The Environmental Working Group and the Community Rights
Counsel, in a letter dated Jan. 10, asked Norton to clarify her
positions, which they described as ``alarming.''
<p>They noted that the phrase ``states' rights'' had often been
used by ``extremist and racial groups with which we are certain
you have not associated and do not want to be associated.''
<p>``We remind you that 'states' rights,' an otherwise neutral
term, has been used as code over the years for a number of
dubious causes: the 'massive resistance' to school integration,
violence against environmental activists and government
environmental employees in the West, and the loosening of
strong enforcement of federal environmental protections,'' the
leaders of the two groups wrote in the letter.
<p>``Who is 'we' in the phrase 'we lost too much,' and what
specifically was 'lost' when the Confederacy lost and slavery
ended in 1865?'' they asked.
<p>Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for Norton and the Bush
transition team, said Norton was making ``a strong case for
local and state rights'' in the speech, and did not intend to
express any sympathy for the Confederacy.
<p>She said the speech also focused on the 10th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, which grants to the states ``powers not
delegated to the United States.''
<p>Regarding the comment on slavery being ``bad facts,'' Mamo
said, ``What she's saying is that it's wrong, that clearly
slavery is wrong. That's a legal term.''
<p>``She absolutely believes slavery is wrong,'' Mamo added.
<p>Like other Bush nominees, Norton is not expected to
personally address the controversy until her Senate
confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 18.
<p>Bush's nominee for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, withdrew
her bid on Tuesday after reports surfaced that she had
sheltered and possibly employed an illegal alien in the 1990s.
<p>Mike Casey, spokesman for the Environmental Working Group,
said it was crucial that Norton set the record straight about
her personal views and the remarks in the 1996 speech.
<p>``These are remarks she should promptly clarify. If she
leaves them stated as such, she is using the same code as a lot
of racist, extremist organizations,'' he said.
<p>He described Norton's speech as a ``jaw-dropper'' and said it
was particularly troubling, given the fact that she would be
heading an agency that employs more than 72,000 people,
including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and is pursuing its own
diversity goals.
<p>If confirmed as interior secretary, Norton would also be
responsible for making federal park lands and facilities
accessible to people with disabilities, Casey noted.
<p>Moreover, he noted, the federal mandating equal treatment
for people with disabilities was signed into law by former
President George Bush, the father of the president-elect.
<p>If confirmed, Norton would also have substantial power to
decide how far the department should go in requiring states to
comply with federal environmental laws and rules governing
mining, drilling and grazing leases.
<p>The speech Norton gave focused primarily on her efforts as
Colorado attorney general to fight for states' rights, and she
described that fight as being long from won.
<p>``This is a battle where we are still very much in the
trenches in trying to make a difference,'' she said.
<p>In the speech, she recalled visiting a Civil War graveyard
in Virginia after a ``massive battle'' with the Environmental
Protection Agency over federal regulations, and said she was
taken aback by a memorial to ``all the Virginia soldiers who
died in defense of the sovereignty of their state.''
<p>``Sure, I had been filing briefs and I thought that was
pretty brave,'' she said.
<p>Noting that ``we certainly had bad facts in that case where
we were defending state sovereignty by defending slavery,''
Norton continued, ``But we lost too much. We lost the idea that
the states were to stand against the federal government gaining
too much power over our lives. That is the point I thin we need
to reappreciate.''
<p>Asked about Norton's remark about the wheelchair ramp, Mamo
said it arose out of frustration that the federal government
had not allowed the state of Colorado to determine the
architecture of the ramp, and how it would blend in with the
design of the Colorado statehouse.
<p>``She believed there should be a wheelchair ramp, but the
state should decide the architecture of the wheelchair ramp,''
Mamo said.
