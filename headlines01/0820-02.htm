WASHINGTON — International arms sales grew 8 percent last year, to nearly $36.9 billion, with the United States further consolidating its stature as the supplier of choice, especially in developing countries, according to a new Congressional report.

American manufacturers signed contracts for just under $18.6 billion, or about half of all weapons sold on the world market during 2000, with 68 percent of the American weapons bought by developing countries.
<P> Russia followed, with $7.7 billion in sales, then France with $4.1 billion, Germany with $1.1 billion, Britain with $600 million, China with $400 million and Italy with $100 million.</p>
<P> The statistics are contained in a study, "Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993- 2000," published by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. The report, updated each year, is one of the most authoritative resources on weapons sales available to the public.</p>
<P> The author, Richard F. Grimmett, notes in an introduction that developing nations remain the largest market for weapons, and a growing one.</p>
<P> "Despite global changes since the cold war's end, the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons suppliers," wrote Mr. Grimmett, a specialist in national defense at the research service.</p>
<P> Worldwide arms sales rose in 2000 for the third year in a row. The previous year, international weapons sales were nearly $34 billion, when measured in constant year 2000 dollars. The value of sales agreements with developing nations was $25.4 billion in 2000, the highest in constant dollars since 1994.</p>
<P> The two leaders in arms sales, the United States and Russia, both increased their new contracts in 2000.</p>
<P> The report is studiously nonpartisan. But its findings will doubtless offer more material for human rights and arms control organizations that criticize the American government — Democratic and Republican administrations — for preaching peaceful relations abroad while allowing American contractors to continue arming the world.</p>
<P> Certain details also underscore national security challenges for the new Bush administration.</p>

The study documents a small but tangible supplier-buyer relationship between Russia and Iran during a time when President Bush is pressing Moscow to end the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. One inducement that administration officials said they might put on the table is to buy Russian interceptors for a missile shield; another would be to offer joint development for high-technology sensors, communications systems or "kill vehicles" of an eventual missile system.
<P> At the same time, however, administration officials express concerns that a Russia-Iran arms relationship could compromise American technological secrets shared with Russia, in addition to destabilizing the region.</p>
<P> There are two ways to track the flow of arms: by sales contracts and by deliveries. </p>
<P> The study found that between 1997 and 2000, Russia agreed to sell Iran $300 million in weapons, measured in constant 2000 dollars. During that same period, Russia delivered to Iran $800 million in arms.</p>
<P> "In late 2000, Russia served public notice that it again intended to pursue major arms sales with Iran, despite objections from the United States," the report states.</p>
<P> The administration's arguments for a missile shield beyond the limits of the ABM Treaty cite Iraq and North Korea as the major threats, and as the report notes, "Iraq was once a major purchaser of advanced weaponry from Russia," but not since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>
<P> "Russia would clearly pursue new major weapons deals with Iraq, if current U.N. sanctions on Iraq that ban Iraqi arms purchases are lifted," the report states.</p>
<P> Russia's principal clients for weapons are India and China. But Moscow enters into joint production deals with those nations, which raises the possibility that eventually they will make the arms domestically, curtailing purchases despite Russia's desire to earn hard currency.</p>
<P> The report also cautions on China's role in the arms market, stating, "With a need for hard currency, and some military products (especially missiles) that some developing countries would like to acquire, China can present an important obstacle to efforts to stem proliferation of advanced missile systems to some areas of the developing world where political and military tensions are significant."</p>
<P> After reaching a peak of $2.7 billion in weapons sales in 1999, China dropped to $400 million last year. Pakistan remained a major buyer.</p>
<P> The increase in sales by the United States, from $12.9 billion in 1999 to nearly $18.6 billion, was powered by a $6.4 billion sale of 80 F-16 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<P> The Emirates, by virtue of its blockbuster purchase of jets from the United States, led the developing world in signing weapons contracts in 2000, with $7.4 billion. India, which signed $4.8 billion in sales deals, ranked second, followed by South Korea, which signed $2.3 billion in contracts.</p>
