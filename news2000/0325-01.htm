- March 25 - Globalization presents growing threats to the planet and its inhabitants, according to a new
report from the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington DC-based research
organization. Forests are shrinking as the value of global trade in forest
products climbs, from $29 billion in 1961 to $139 billion in 1998. And fisheries
are collapsing as fish exports rise, growing nearly fivefold in value since 1970
to reach $52 billion in 1997. Human health is also endangered, with pesticide
exports increasing nearly ninefold since 1961, to $11.4 billion in 1998.
</font>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The surge in movements of goods, money, species, and pollution across international borders
is placing unprecedented strains on the planet,” said Hilary French, author of
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/pubs/ea/van.html"><b>Vanishing Borders: Protecting the Planet
in the Age of Globalization</b></a></i>. “Ironically, the best way to tackle these
problems is by putting globalization to work for us, instead of against us.”
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Channeling globalization to protect, rather than undermine, the earth’s natural systems,
is key to building an environmentally stable society in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. People are using new communications technologies to create powerful
international coalitions, like last December’s outpouring of citizen concern
at the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Seattle. And trade can help
spread environmentally beneficial products and technologies, from shade-grown
coffee to wind power. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">World exports of goods increased 17-fold between 1950 and 1998, from $311
billion to $5.4 trillion; the volume of foreign direct investment has grown
almost 15-fold just since 1970, reaching $644 billion in 1998; and the number of
transnational corporations worldwide grew from 7,000 in 1970 to some 60,000
today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These
trends pose major environmental challenges. While economists tout
record-breaking increases in global commerce in recent decades, more sobering
statistics are being reported by the world’s leading biologists: the loss of
living species in recent decades represents the largest mass extinction since
the dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Globalization
is a powerful driving force behind today’s unprecedented biological implosion.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An
upsurge of trade and investment in natural resources sectors such as forestry,
mining, and petroleum development is threatening the health of the world’s
forests, mountains, waters, and other sensitive ecosystems. And the rapid growth
in the movement of human beings and their goods and services has provided
convenient transportation for thousands of other species of plants and animals
that are now taking root on foreign shores. On any given day, some 2 million
people cross international borders, while 3,000 to 10,000 aquatic species are
moving around the world in ship ballasts. Once &quot;exotic species&quot;
establish a beachhead in a foreign ecosystem, they often proliferate,
suppressing native species, and imposing high economic costs.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International commerce is also a potent mechanism through
which hazardous products and technologies move around the world. Over the last
few decades, the developing world has become home to a growing share of the
hazard-laden petrochemical industry. Approximately 41 percent of U.S. foreign
direct investment in the Philippines in 1998 was in chemicals, as was 22 percent
of such investment in Colombia.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High-tech
industries such as computers and electronics have also gone global in recent
years. Despite their early reputation as relatively clean, these industries can
exact heavy environmental costs. Semiconductor manufacturing employs hundreds of
chemicals, including arsenic, benzene, and chromium, all of which are known
carcinogens. More than half of all computer manufacturing and assembly
operations—processes intensive in their use of acids, solvents, and toxic
gases—are now located in developing countries, according to the San Jose,
California-based Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite
the environmental risks, the forces of globalization can also produce
environmental gains, such as helping developing countries leapfrog to the
cleaner technologies of tomorrow. China has become the world’s largest
manufacturer of energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs in recent
years, in part through joint ventures with lighting firms based in Hong Kong,
Japan, the Netherlands, and Taiwan. And India has become a major manufacturer of
advanced wind turbines with the help of technology obtained through joint
ventures and licensing agreements with Danish, Dutch, and German firms.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several countries are working to harness the global economy to protect
rather than decimate natural wealth. Costa Rica is now a major destination for
eco-tourists, capitalizing on its moist cloud forests, sandy beaches, and dry
deciduous forests. And many other countries have moved to tap into the booming
international market for organic produce. Mexico now has some 10,000 organic
farms on 15,000 hectares of land, most of them run by small farmers. While
coffee is their mainstay, Mexico's organic farmers also cultivate apples,
avocados, coconuts, cardamom, honey, and potatoes.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Redirecting the global economy away from environmentally harmful
activities and into more sustainable ones will require a multi-pronged strategy,
starting with requiring international economic institutions to pay more heed to
the environmental impact of their programs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since
the World Trade Organization was established in 1994, its dispute resolution
panels have ruled that several national environmental laws constitute illegal
trade barriers, including provisions of a U.S. law aimed at protecting
endangered sea turtles and a European Union (EU) ban on the sale of
hormone-raised beef. And trade tensions are rising between the European Union
and the U.S. over European restrictions on planting genetically modified crops
and a requirement that food containing them be labeled as such.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">French calls for the WTO to incorporate a greater respect for the
precautionary principle, which holds that lack of scientific certainty should
not be used as a reason for postponing action where there are threats of serious
or irreversible damage. She also advocates protecting consumers' right to know
about the health and environmental impact of products they purchase by
safeguarding eco-labeling programs, allowing countries to use trade measures to
protect the global commons, and deferring to international environmental
treaties in cases where they conflict with trade rules.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Better integration of environmental issues into the lending programs of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund would yield additional
ecological dividends. On paper, the development-oriented World Bank is far more
open than the IMF to environmental concerns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But a recent internal review by the World Bank of more than 50 recent
structural adjustment loans found that few of them paid much heed to
environmental and social matters. Whereas a 1993 Bank report found that some 60
percent of such loans included environmental goals, the recent study concluded
that this share had now plummeted to less than 20 percent. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A
stronger international environmental infrastructure is also needed to act as an
ecological counterweight to today’s growing economic powerhouses.
Environmental treaties now number more than 230, with three-fourths of them
agreed to over the last thirty years. But the effectiveness of these agreements
is often undermined by vague commitments and lax enforcement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Environmentalists should take a page from the World Trade Organization
and push for international environmental commitments that are as specific and
enforceable as trade accords have become,” says French. In <i>Vanishing
Borders</i>, French calls for upgrading the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP)
into a World Environmental Organization that can coordinate and strengthen the
current scattered collection of environmental treaty bodies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New
information and communications technologies can be harnessed to forge powerful
cross-border political alliances—a trend that is already well underway. The
number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working across international
borders soared during the last century, climbing from just 176 in 1909 to more
than 23,000 in 1998. Empowered by e-mail and the Internet, environmental
activists have gradually organized themselves into a range of powerful
international networks, such as the Climate Action Network, the International
Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, and the Women’s Environment and
Development Organization. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some
forward-looking corporations are helping to chart the path to an environmentally
sustainable global economy, according to the report. In recent years, some
10,000 companies worldwide, many from the developing world, have become
certified under the voluntary environmental management guidelines forged by the
Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization, a worldwide
federation of national standards-setting bodies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Private
investors are also increasingly active on environmental issues. In 1999,
concerned investors introduced 54 shareholder resolutions related to
environmental issues. In one particularly successful case, Home Depot announced
a commitment to purchasing certified timber just three months after 12 percent
of its shareholders asked the company to stop selling wood from old-growth
forests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Vanishing Borders</i>, French finds that
innovative partnerships are being forged between activist groups, businesses and
international institutions, including several independent eco-labeling
initiatives that aim to bring consumer pressure to bear on behalf of
environmental change. For example, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was
established in 1993 to set standards for sustainable forest production through a
cooperative process involving timber traders and retailers as well as
environmental organizations and forest dwellers. As of late 1999, FSC-accredited
bodies had certified some 17 million hectares of forest in 30 countries, up from
only 1 million hectares in late 1995.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite these encouraging developments, environmental destruction
continues to outpace society's collective response. &quot;Over the course of the
twentieth century, the global economy stretched the planet to its limits,&quot;
said French. &quot;The time is now ripe to forge the international policies and
institutions needed to ensure that the world economy of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century meets peoples’ aspirations for a better future without destroying the
natural fabric that underpins life itself.&quot;</font>
