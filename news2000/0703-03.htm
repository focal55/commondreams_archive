- July 3 - A nationwide opinion

poll of 1,014 households released for the Fourth of July holiday

reveals that Americans view a number of their constitutionally

guaranteed rights as being less than secure.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most endangered? Equal access to the courts. According to the

survey, fewer than 1 out of every 3 Americans (28 percent) believe

that rich and poor people have equal access to the federal courts a

right of access guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In this survey, Americans are saying it's a fact of life that

they no longer have access to the federal judicial system," says Jeff

Barge, a New York-based public relations consultant who commissioned

the study. "Historians will look back and wonder why we allowed this

right to be taken from us."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The random telephone poll of 1,015 American households was

conducted by Opinion Research Corp. International. of Princeton, N.J.

and has a margin of error of 3 percent.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Courts Get Failing Grade, But Other Rights Fare Better
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While panning the poor job federal courts have done in

guaranteeing equal access to the federal justice system, Americans

feel much more sanguine about their other constitutional rights as

they approach the first Fourth of July of the new millennium. Among

other results:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 87 percent of those surveyed say that rich and poor have equal

access to free expression of religion. But while 90 percent of those

aged 65 and older felt this right was secure, only 80 percent of

those aged 18-24 felt this to be true.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 83 percent feel that rich and poor have equal access to the

right to vote. Little difference of opinion existed on this issue

regardless of age, race or income.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 64 percent feel that rich and poor have equal access to the

right to free speech. But only 58 percent of those in the 18-34 age

group felt this to be the case, compared to 76 percent of those aged

65 and older.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 41 percent say they truly believe that rich and poor have equal

access to the right to run for political office. But only 35 percent

of those in the 18-34 age group feel this way, compared to 48 percent

of those aged 55 and older. By race, 45 percent of Hispanics,

43 percent of whites and 32 percent of blacks felt equal access

to run for political office exists.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 28 percent feel rich and poor have equal access to federal

courts. By race, only 1 in 5 black Americans say they truly believe

that rich and poor have equal access to the federal courts

(20 percent), with only 28 percent of whites and 27 percent

of Hispanics feeling that way. Among those aged 55-to-64 belief

in equal access to the courts plummets to 23 percent, while

a third of respondents aged 18-24 (33 percent) believe equal

access exists.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Survey: Cost, Bias Deny Equal Judicial Access
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the study, several factors appear to explain why the

judicial system got the thumbs down when judged on the job it has

done in protecting equal access to federal courts. Among the top

factors is a perception of bias on the part of federal judges:

49 percent of those surveyed feel that federal judges are "at

least occasionally biased" against the poor, while one out of

three Americans (34 percent) feel that federal judges are "often"

biased against the poor when making their decisions.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of those surveyed feel the judicial selection process has

become politicized and biased. Forty- seven percent of those surveyed

believe that federal judges are appointed nowadays because they

have helped raise money for political parties or candidates;

and 37 percent believe that most federal judges being appointed

today are wealthy white people.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forty six percent of those surveyed say that if they had a legal

problem they would not have enough money to hire a lawyer. More than

two out of every three Americans (68 percent) with annual incomes

below $25,000 feel this way. But even the richest Americans feel

locked out: One out of every three (34 percent) Americans with annual

income exceeding $50,000 per year say they couldn't afford a lawyer

if they needed one.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, 80 percent of those surveyed believe that most people who

bring lawsuits in federal courts without a lawyer will lose because

the courts have become too complicated for the average person to

understand.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">View of Judicial System: Reality Based
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent events in the news may account in part for the poor

perception of the federal judiciary when it comes to protecting equal

access. One of the highest profile judicial news stories in past year

has been the decades-long refusal of Supreme Court justices to hire

black or minority law clerks.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans were stunned to see Supreme Court justices Souter and

Rehnquist testify before Congress this year that it's impossible for

them to find a single black law school graduate in the entire country

qualified to work on their staffs," said Barge. "Someone has given

the Supreme Court some very bad advice on this issue. This is not

a problem of public relations, but of substantive discrimination."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other factors influencing Americans' view of vanishing judicial

equality include a study released in April 2000, "And Justice for

Some," funded by several of the nation's leading foundations. The

study says black youths convicted of drug offenses are 48 times more

likely to be sentenced to juvenile prison as white youths. Overall,

black youths with no record are six times as likely as whites to be

imprisoned.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to civil suits brought by the poor, a study by the Hastings

School of Law in San Francisco of civil suits brought in federal

court by poor people who can't afford attorneys showed that federal

judges allow just one out of of 650 suits to go to trial -- or

just 0.0015 percent. When Hastings School of Law asked the federal

Judicial Conference for its assistance in determining the cause

of this apparent bias, the assistance was refused. The Judicial

Conference makes policy for the U.S. courts.
