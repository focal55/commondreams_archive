- April 25 - In a new report issued today

on Nike's Asian manufacturing practices, a coalition of labor,

student, and human rights groups demonstrates that while Nike has

stated that they have improved their labor practices, the truth is

that sweatshop factories still produce Nike goods.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, "Sweatshops Behind the Swoosh," compiles for the first

time detailed Nike manufacturing information from three Asian

countries and shows that "Nike remains a sweatshop producer on a

global scale." In fact, according to the report -- which is being

released today at a demonstration in front of New York's Niketown --

some of the information directly contradicts Nike's own code of

conduct.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report makes it clear that Nike is making China the country of

choice for its global sweatshop strategy, recently having moved

40 percent of its contracting work there. It has also become evident

that exploitation of Chinese workers is clearly a profitable business

proposition for the company. In fact, the average Nike worker appears

to be worse off than typical Chinese apparel workers (based on Nike

and DOL numbers).
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated that Nike workers in China receive at most $1.50

for every pair of Nike shoes, which retail typically for $80-$120.

Nike could easily afford to double or triple what it pays its Chinese

workforce. Instead, Nike supports Permanent Normal Trade Relations

with China, which would permanently set the rules of trade in a

manner that would allow Nike to continue to build its sweatshop

headquarters in China.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five Nike executives (including the wife of one executive) have

contributed to Congressman David Dreier's American Success PAC.

Dreier is the Republican whip behind giving China Permanent Normal

Trade Relations.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also demonstrates that Nike's efforts in this regard

are not limited to China. For example, while Nike has bragged about

wage increases at its Indonesia footwear plants, the facts make it

clear that these claims are wildly misleading. Workers' real

inflation-adjusted wages have actually fallen at these plants, due
to

the Asian financial crisis. The "increases" touted by Nike did not

keep up with the deterioration of the Indonesian currency and rapidly

rising costs for basic products such as food and clothing.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is being issued in New York City this afternoon at a

4:30 p.m. rally in front of the flagship Niketown Store on 57th

Street between 5th and Madison Avenues in Manhattan. In addition to

UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees),

groups endorsing the report are Global Exchange, National Labor

Committee, People of Faith Network, Press for Change, Resource Center

of the Americas, and United Students Against Sweatshops.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition's white paper states: "The deplorable conditions in

Nike factories are Nike's fault. In a global economy with no rules

that protect workers, it is companies such as Nike who direct the

global sweatshop in industries such as clothing and footwear. To

rescue its brand image, Nike must turn from public relations to

paying a living wage, providing humane working conditions, and

respecting the right of workers to organize. And to stop the

sweatshop system of global trade, we all need to demand that workers'

rights be linked to the trading rights that are the lifeblood for

companies like Phil Knight's Nike."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Findings
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report brings together three accounts of working conditions at

Nike production facilities in Indonesia, China and other locations
in

Asia. Among its findings are:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A recent survey of 3,500 workers producing for Nike in

Indonesia finds serious labor abuses, including low wages, abusive

treatment, and excessive work hours. 57 percent of Nike athletic shoe

workers and 59 percent of Nike clothing workers reported that they

had seen workers being shouted at or subjected to cruel treatment by

their supervisors. Examples of abuse that workers cited included wage

deductions, having their ears pulled, being pinched or slapped, being

forced to run around the factory or having to stand for hours in

factory yards (known as "being dried in the sun"). Workers' most

common complaint was being forced to work excessive overtime -- more

than 72 hours per week during peak periods. Nike's code of conduct

calls for working hours to be limited to 60 hours. The vast majority

of Nike shoe workers interviewed told surveyors their basic wages at

the time of the survey were between $33 U.S. (Rp 251,000) and $39

U.S. (Rp 300,000) per month -- which comes to about 16-19 cents an

hour. This wage does not even come close to covering the costs of a

family's basic human needs. Nike apparel workers in Indonesia earn

even less than Nike footwear workers. The survey found that 31

percent of the 1,200 Nike apparel workers interviewed earned less

than the equivalent of $33 U.S. dollars per month (Rp 250,000). That

is 25 percent percent less than what even Nike says is that it takes

to meet one person's minimum physical needs, without taking into

consideration providing for family members or savings.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Reports based on interviews with Nike workers in China reveal

inhumane working hours including 12-hour days and 7-day weeks, low

wages, illegal deductions, and use of the notorious dormitory system.

About 50 Nike footwear and apparel factories in China employ over

111,000 workers. A new set of reports based on recent investigations

documents that Nike workers in China continue to suffer deplorable

conditions. In December, 1999 and March, 2000, the Hong Kong

Christian Industrial Committee (HKCIC) interviewed workers at

factories producing for Nike in China's Guangdong province. Their

reports show that workers who make Nike products endure abusive and

often illegal conditions (please note, the spellings are from the

HKCIC). Workers report that they are required to work 12 1/2 hour

days and seven day work-weeks, with one day off per month at one Nike

contractor (Hung Wah/Hung Yip garment factory). At another factory

(Wei Li Textile) some workers report working 12 hour days. A worker

at the Qingdau Sewon Shoes Company told the HKCIC that she must work

overtime everyday, sometimes until 2-3 a.m. Not only are these

conditions extreme and inhumane, they also clearly violate Chinese

law where the legal limit is a 40 hour week plus overtime that must

average less than 9 hours (36 hours/ month). Nike's code of conduct

limits the workweek to 60 hours.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike advertises with apparent pride that many of its workers are

housed in dormitories on factory premises. But the workers in most

Nike plants are trapped in the dormitory system. Low wages force

workers, most of whom have migrated from distant rural provinces, to

live in dorms where they live 8- 12 people to a room. Workers live

within the grounds of the factory, with severe limitations on their

freedoms. At two factories, management withholds one month's wages,

making it difficult for workers to quit without management's

permission if they hope to receive their back pay. In one Nike

contractor factory, workers live 12 to a room, and share three

toilets for 36 women. Workers pay 35 RMB a month for the privilege
of

living in this dorm.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike's Code of Conduct states that the Company will not

countenance discrimination in hiring based on gender, marital status,

or age, among other worker characteristics. However, a recruitment

advertisement for the factory found by HKCIC investigators advised

potential applicants of the following "requirements": "Gender: female

only; Age: 17-21; Marital status: management requires applicants to

present a 'single certificate' certifying workers' single marital

status."
