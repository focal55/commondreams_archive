- April 13 - Promising to hold 
elected officials accountable on the environment, the bipartisan 
League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today announced a $6 million 
effort to inform the public about the environmental records of 
members of Congress and federal candidates. 

<p>With today's announcement, LCV launched the most aggressive, 
most bipartisan campaign program ever undertaken by an 
environmental organization. 

<p>According to LCV president Deb Callahan, the 2000 elections will 
see the emergence of the environmental issue as a top-tier election 
issue. LCV plans to build on heightened environmental attention 
generated from the 30th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22, and 
maintain that environmental momentum through Election Day on 
November 7. 

<p>"The time is right for environmental issues to move to the 
forefront of this year's campaigns," Callahan said. "The nation is 
enjoying relative peace and prosperity and voters can afford to 
focus on issues that pertain to their quality of life. Voters are 
beginning to understand that Congress has been chipping away at our 
environmental laws. No other issue more completely affects each 
American -- from the quality of the water we drink and air we 
breathe, to the health of our communities and the legacy we leave 
our children -- than the issue of environmental protection." 

<p>As part of its "Earth Day to Election Day" campaign strategy, 
the LCV Action Fund, LCV's political action committee, unveiled a 
new "Environmental Champions" campaign to promote the strong 
environmental records of select Republican and Democratic 
congressional candidates in tight races. U.S. Reps. Chris Shays 
(R-Conn.), Joseph Hoeffel (D-Pa.) and Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) were 
named the first "Environmental Champions" of 2000. 

<p>About being named an "Environmental Champion" Shays said, 
"During my service in Congress, I've tried to maintain a healthy 
respect for the world we inhabit and I've worked with my colleagues 
to fight attempts to rollback laws that protect our environment. 
I'm honored the League of Conservation Voters has recognized that 
effort. We were only given one Earth on which to live and if we do 
not cherish it we may very well lose it." 

<p>In 1998, Congressman Inslee witnessed the power of LCV's 
campaigns when his opponent, then Rep. Rick White (R-Wash.) was 
named to the Dirty Dozen and was ultimately defeated. Said Inslee, 
"I feel honored to be recognized today as a champion for the 
environment. I hope this event marks the beginning of a legacy of 
lawmakers who are expected to protect our natural environment, 
rather than singled out for their actions." 

<p>About Hoeffel's environmental record, Callahan said, 
"Congressman Hoeffel is an outstanding example of how effective and 
courageous a first-term member of Congress can be. He consistently 
votes to protect the environment and has numerous bills to preserve 
open space and farmland, combat the effects of suburban sprawl and 
protect taxpayers from paying the bill for environmentally harmful 
government subsidies." 

<p>By employing a variety of tactics and strategies, the LCV Action 
Fund will aggressively campaign to inform voters about the 
"Environmental Champions'" leadership and record. The 
"Environmental Champions" list will ultimately grow to about eight 
to ten candidates. 

<p>LCV is perhaps best known for its Dirty Dozen campaigns that 
target for defeat Congressional candidates with poor environmental 
records. Since 1996, LCV has campaigned against 25 Dirty Dozen 
candidates, helping to defeat 16. In 1999, the average LCV score of 
defeated Dirty Dozen designees was 19 percent, their replacements 
averaged 84 percent. The only candidate to be named to the Dirty 
Dozen so far in 2000 is U.S. Rep. Jim Traficant (D-Ohio). LCV ran 
television ads in March to publicize his votes against the 
environment and to highlight the strong environmental record of 
his primary challenger Bob Hagan. Other Dirty Dozen designees will 
be named in June and September. LCV will dedicate nearly $3 million 
to the 2000 Dirty Dozen campaign. 

<p>In addition to tough campaign programs, LCV also provides direct 
candidate support. Through the EarthList program, the LCV Action 
Fund generates contributions for the campaigns of strong 
environmentalists who are in competitive races. Reps. Jim Ramstad 
(R-Minn.), David Bonior (D-Mich.), Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), Sherwood 
Boehlert (R-N.Y.), Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Rush Holt (D-N.J.) and 
Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) are currently named to the 2000 
EarthList. Three more candidates will be added before October. 

<p>The LCV Action Fund also publicly endorses candidates. Current 
endorsements include: <p>

- Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.)<br>
- Rep. John Olver (D-Mass.) <br>
- Rep. Sherry Boehlert (R-N.Y.) <br>

- Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) <br>
- Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) <br>
- Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) <br>
- Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) <br><br>

By October, LCV will endorse about 100 Republican and Democratic 
pro-environment candidates running for the U.S. House or U.S. 
Senate. <br><br>

"This is the third election cycle we've run direct campaigns and 
we've learned that our presence in a race can make the difference," 
said Callahan. "Our board, our staff and our members are committed 
to supporting environmental friends, defeating environmental foes, 
and most importantly, giving citizens the resources to make 
informed environmental decisions on Election Day." <br><br>

While LCV has not made a presidential endorsement at this time, 
the group did produce in-depth environmental profiles of each 
presidential candidate that are available over the Internet at 
http://www.lcv.org/presidential. LCV updates the information weekly 
with the most recent environmental news from the campaigns. 
Callahan predicts that environmental issues will rise to the top of 
the agenda for the presidential candidates as the race heat up. <br><br>

The bipartisan League of Conservation Voters is the political 
voice for the environmental and conservation community. The League 
is a nonprofit organization dedicated to informing the public about 
the environmental records of federally elected officials. For each 
session of Congress, LCV produces the National Environmental 
Scorecard that rates the environmental voting records of U.S. 
Representatives and Senators. All campaign material and the 
Scorecards are available to the public through the LCV Web site,
