          - February 15 - The gay, lesbian and bisexual (GLB) electorate in the 
          United States is large and powerful enough to tip the scales in both 
          hotly contested Congressional elections and in close elections in key 
          states such as California, a report released Monday by the Policy Institute 
          of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reveals. Overall, the GLB 
          vote was 5 percent of the electorate in the 1996 election. In cities 
          of more than half a million inhabitants, 9 percent of voters self-identified 
          as GLB, while in medium-sized cities (50,000 to 500,000 inhabitants) 
          GLB voters comprised 7 percent of the electorate. </font> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The report, entitled 
            <i>Out and Voting II: The Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Vote in Congressional 
            Elections, 1990-1998</i> is an expanded and more comprehensive update 
            of a report first released two years ago. The new report includes 
            data from the 1998 elections and also takes a concentrated look at 
            the GLB electorate in California. The report was authored by Robert 
            W. Bailey, Ph.D., a political scientist at Rutgers University. It 
            is published by the NGLTF Policy Institute, a think tank dedicated 
            to research, policy analysis, strategy development and coalition building 
            to advance the equality and understanding of gay, lesbian, bisexual 
            and transgendered (GLBT) people. </font>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"California will 
            play a crucial role in the election of the next president and the 
            composition of the next Congress," said NGLTF Executive Director Kerry 
            Lobel. "The GLB electorate in both California and across the nation 
            is sizable and independent. This electorate, bolstered by the increasing 
            number of voters who support equality for GLBT people, has the power 
            to tip the balance in the year 2000 elections." </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some of the major 
            findings of <i>Out and Voting II</i> include: </font>
          <p> 
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The self-identified 
              GLB electorate has increased steadily since it was first measured 
              in the 1990 mid-term Congressional elections at 1.3 percent of the 
              vote. Over the course of the next three elections, it grew to 5.0 
              percent in the 1996 mid-term elections, before dipping slightly 
              to 4.2 percent in 1998. </font> 
              <p> 
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GLB vote 
              is independent: in 1998, one third of GLB voters backed Republican 
              Congressional candidates. But GLB voters remain a core constituency 
              of the Democratic Party, surpassed only by the African American 
              and Jewish electorates in their support for Democratic candidates. 
              </font> 
              <p> 
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 
              fact that GLB voters support Democratic Congressional candidates 
              in greater numbers than non-GLB voters, the number of GLB voters 
              who are casting ballots for Republican candidates is on the rise. 
              In the 1992 elections, 23 percent of GLB voters cast their ballots 
              for Republican Congressional candidates. This figure rose to 26 
              percent in 1994, 28 percent in 1996 and 33 percent in 1998. </font> 
              <p> 
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GLB electorate 
              played a key role in the victory of Democrats in California in 1998, 
              a trend that has tremendous implications for the year 2000 elections. 
              In all, 73 percent of GLB voters cast their ballots for Democrat 
              Gov. Gray Davis, compared to 58 percent of voters overall. And 71 
              percent of GLB voters cast their ballots for Democrat U.S. Sen. 
              Barbara Boxer, compared with 54 percent of voters overall. </font>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The report found 
            that the GLB electorate in California is sizable, progressive and 
            independent. "In recent years, it has been a key constituency in the 
            victorious campaigns of its two U.S. Senators and its new Governor, 
            helping to shift the balance of power in the Golden State from Republicans 
            to Democrats," Out and Voting II author Robert Bailey found. "GLB 
            voters in California will continue to play a pivotal role in the 2000 
            elections, helping decide who will represent California in Congress 
            and who will reside in the White House." </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The report also 
            found that while the GLB electorate is particularly strong in large 
            cities&#151;nearly 9 percent in cities with populations exceeding 
            half a million inhabitants&#151;it is also strong in mid-sized cities. 
            In cities with populations ranging from 50,000 to half a million, 
            7.2 percent of the electorate is gay, lesbian or bisexual. In small 
            towns and suburbs, GLB people are about 4 percent of the vote. </font>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This figure 
            is particularly telling, given the number of hotly contested House 
            races that are in or around small- to mid-sized cities," Lobel said. 
            "The Democrat and Republican Parties ignore the GLB vote in these 
            races at their peril." </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Indeed, the report 
            found that at the time of the 1998 mid-term elections, 61 percent 
            of GLB voters lived in a congressional district represented by a first-term 
            Republican. "Not only is this a vote that can help Democrats recapture 
            seats, but GLB voters in general live in swing districts that Democrats 
            will need to preserve," Bailey found. "Identifying competitive Congressional 
            House districts where there are substantial GLB voters and then mobilizing 
            these voters for Democratic candidates could be a crucial factor in 
            recapturing a Democratic majority in the House. </font>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The transfer 
            of a few seats in the House in the 2000 elections would result in 
            a change in Congressional leadership away from members who have publicly 
            identified themselves as unsupportive of the lives of GLBT Americans," 
            the report concludes. "A systematic strategy of voter mobilization 
            in key districts would give the emerging GLB electorate the clout 
            that its numbers suggest it deserves." </font>
