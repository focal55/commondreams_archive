- April 25 - Led by Doris Haddock ("Granny D") and the revered environmental writer 
Bill McKibben, the 32-member John Muir Democracy Brigade, a merger of 
campaign-finance and environmental activists, sallied forth in the Rotunda of 
the national Capitol on Friday, April 21, with banners and speeches for an 
end to the endangerment of the earth by oil, coal, and nuclear industries.  
All 32, including Granny D, McKibben, and leaders of various organizations, 
were arrested by the Capitol police for "demonstrating" in the Capitol 
contrary to a federal law which carries a maximum six-month jail term.
    <p>"We no longer have proper representation," Ms. Haddock, the 90-year-old 
woman who walked across the continent for campaign finance reform, told a 
press conference on the Senate lawn before she led the group into the 
Rotunda. "Our elected leaders are consumed by the need to raise election 
funds from special interests, and they no longer are able to represent the 
needs of the people or of our ravaged earth.
    <p>"We must declare our independence from the corrupting bonds of big 
money," she continued.  "Our right to alter our government must be used to 
sweep these halls clean of greedy interests so that people may use this 
government in service to each other's needs and the protect the condition of 
our earth."
    <p>This was the fourth Democracy Brigade action, and the largest, since last 
Oct. 26th. The demonstrators carried enormous banners proclaiming that 
"Campaign Finance Corruption Leads to Environmental Destruction," "When 
Democracy Is For Sale So Is the Environment,"  and "Clean Elections Equal 
Clean Environment," and demanding:  "Stop Global Warming--Ban Campaign 
Contributions from Global Warmers."  The Brigades, a project of the Alliance 
for Democracy, are demonstrating on behalf of full public funding for public 
elections.  They aim to obtain official congressional hearings on that 
proposal by the spring of next year.
    <p>McKibben, the author of THE END OF NATURE, said that there is now a 
"strong consensus" in the scientific community that global warming is 
dangerous and that even some large companies, such as British Petroleum and 
Shell, have joined in the concern.  "The only people that seem not to get it 
work in that building behind us," which "may have something to do with the 
millions and millions of dollars that flow in to that building from the 
interests that do not want to change the status quo," McKibben said.
    <p>Referring to Granny D's walk, McKibben said, "When I'm 90 I plan to  walk 
across the country, and hopefully it will still be as sweet and lovely a 
country as it is now."
    <p>John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone Action, declared that 
"this type of peaceful civil disobedience is the new face of democracy.  It's 
not just about voting any more because in some way that has been stolen from 
us by what's going on in this building behind us....It has ceased to be the 
people's house."
    <p>At some point, said Randy Hayes, president of the Rainforest Action 
Network, democracy "becomes a democracy theme park," in which the two major 
parties represent "a distinction without a difference" and jeopardize "the 
earth itself."  Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass 
Energy Project, told the press conference:  "The Democracy Brigade is here 
today to demonstrate that people will not stand for this type of legalized 
bribery any longer."
    <p>Representing the principal sponsor of the event, the Alliance for 
Democracy, Ronnie Dugger said, "We are a part of a general nonviolent 
uprising of the people against the sale of our government to the highest 
bidder."  Congress and the White House, by "risking the killing of this green 
and pleasant earth and all that lives on it" to rake in campaign 
contributions, are committing "a crime so vast it has no name," Dugger also 
said.
    <p>The speakers and allied activists then followed Granny D into the Capitol 
Rotunda and  spoke out in six separate groups, which the Capitol police 
arrested one at a time.  McKibben was arrested with the first group and Ms. 
Haddock with the third.  Ms. Haddock was reading a passage from the 
Declaration of Independence when she was arrested and handcuffed.  The 
demonstrators, including all the speakers at the press conference, were 
photographed and their thumbprints taken, and they were ordered to appear in 
District of Columbia court on May 24th to answer the charges against them.
        <p>The press conference and Rotunda speak-out were carried at length on 
C-Span and were featured news on NPR's "All Things Considered."  Ms. 
Haddock's arrest was the subject of an AP story and a feature article in Roll 
Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper.
    
<p>The Rotunda actions will continue throughout the year 2000.  Those who 
wish to participate in the next action may contact Randy Kehler at telephone 
413-624-3836, or by email at randyk@javanet.com.  Further information may be 
obtained from the Alliance national office at 781-894-1179. <a href="http://afd-online.org">http://afd-online.org</a>
