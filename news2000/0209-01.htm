- February 9 - During the 1998-99 season, prime time
network television offered almost no depictions of the kind of work/family
conflicts that Americans face every day. A new study, commissioned by the
National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, concludes that prime time
entertainment television rarely shows characters struggling to balance work and
family responsibilities like child care, elder care and family leave. The study
also found that TV portrays single male characters in workplace settings more
often than married or female characters, and depicts men in positions of power
much more often than women.
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Television is a powerful cultural influence that affects our
lives in many ways, said National Partnership President Judith L. Lichtman. By
reflecting Americans’ experiences, TV can draw attention to the challenges we
face, and foster awareness and change. Our study confirms that, like many
workplaces, TV is still catching up to the challenges facing America’s working
families today.

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>Prime Time @ Wor</i>k examined situation comedies, dramas, and
animated series on four broadcast networks that were among the top-rated 100
programs of the 1998-99 prime time season. The sample consisted of a constructed
week of prime-time programming on the ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC networks, compiled
from a three-month sample period (March, April, May). Martha M. Lauzen, Ph.D.,
professor of communication at San Diego State University, led the team that
analyzed a total of 719 adult characters on 59 prime time programs.
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Work/family conflicts were depicted just eleven times on a total
of ten programs in the sample, and were major story lines in just five
instances. A mere one percent of characters experienced any work/family conflict
a drop from three percent of characters who experienced such conflicts in a
study commissioned by the National Partnership of the 1997-98 television season.
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The study also found that:

  
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Fully 99 percent of prime time TV characters never
    experienced work/family conflicts;
    
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Non-parents and single and male adult characters were most
    likely to be shown at work. Three in five adult non-parents (61 percent) and
    just 38 percent of adult parents were shown in work settings;
  

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Add One


  
    
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two in three single characters (68 percent) and just 42
    percent of married characters were shown in work settings;
    
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Female characters were more likely to be identified by their
    marital status, while male characters were more likely to be identified by
    their occupation;
    
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sixty-nine percent of adult male characters and 62 percent
    of adult female characters were shown in work settings; and
    
<p ALIGN="LEFT">When major characters were examined, 41 percent of male
    characters and just 25 percent of female characters held powerful jobs.
  

  
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Examples of work/family conflicts portrayed include:
  
  
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>The Norm Show:</i> Danny’s father drops by the office and
  asks Danny to go to lunch. Danny can’t go because he has to work.
  
  
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>Nash Bridges:</i> Joe attends a parent-teacher conference
  during work hours.
  
  
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>Party of Five:</i> A power outage at the restaurant he manages
  makes Bailey late for sister Claudia’s 16th birthday party.
  
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>Profiler:</i> Samantha Waters is at work when she receives a
  call from her daughter's school. Her daughter, Chloe, is missing. Samantha
  leaves work to look for her.

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>Prime Time @ Work</i> is the second in a series of periodic
studies commissioned by the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families on
work/family issues on prime time television. The 1998 study, <i>Balancing Acts:
Work/Family Issues on Prime Time Television, </i>found that on television most
adults were men, few mothers worked for pay, and almost no one was over age 50.
The National Partnership is using this research to raise awareness about
work/family issues, and to alert TV networks and producers to missed
opportunities in portraying the experiences of working families.
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>The National Partnership for Women &amp; Families is a
nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that uses public education and advocacy to
promote fairness in the workplace, quality health care, and policies that help
women and men meet the dual demands of work and family.</i>
