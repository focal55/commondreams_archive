- October 25 - The East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) today praised 
continued congressional support for a East Timor's transition to 
independence. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for fiscal year 
2001 (HR 4811), passed by both houses of Congress today, continues 
restrictions on military assistance to Indonesia until its government and 
military have cooperated fully with efforts to prosecute those responsible 
for human rights violations in Indonesia and East Timor, "allowed refugees 
to return home, and actively prevented militia incursions" into East Timor. 
The bill also appropriates $25 million to support East Timor's transition 
to self-government.

<p>"This bill demonstrates continued congressional commitment to human rights 
in Indonesia and East Timor and to maintain pressure on the Indonesian 
military and government until East Timorese refugees have safely returned 
home and East Timor completes a peaceful transition to independence," said 
Lynn Fredriksson, ETAN Washington Representative and Interim Coordinator of 
the new Indonesia Human Rights Network.

<p>"We are pleased that Congress has appropriated $25 million in economic 
support to rebuild East Timor both physically and politically. This is the 
least the U.S. can do given past support for Indonesia's occupation of East 
Timor," said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.

<p>The appropriations bill continues to link restoration of U.S. military 
assistance to Indonesia to substantial progress in prosecuting members of 
the Indonesian armed forces and militias responsible for massive loss of 
life and extensive destruction in East Timor, particularly surrounding last 
year's overwhelming pro-independence vote. President Clinton is expected to 
sign the bill.

<p>In report language explaining the bill, members of Congress said, "The 
managers strongly urge the Secretaries of Defense and State to press the 
government of Indonesia to fulfill its commitment to disarm and disband 
militia groups, end military and financial support for these groups, and 
bring militia leaders to justice."

<p>"It is important for Congress and the administration to recognize the 
devastating impact the Indonesian military continues to have on human 
rights and democracy throughout Indonesia. Military ties should not be 
restored until there is civilian control of the military and accountability 
for human rights abuses," said Karen Orenstein, ETAN's Washington Organizer.

<p>The bill requires the Indonesian military and government to cooperate with 
investigations and prosecutions of Indonesian armed forces and militia 
groups responsible for human rights violations in Indonesia, as well as 
East Timor before restoring U.S. military assistance. This is especially 
important in Aceh, West Papua and Maluku, where Indonesian forces continue 
to brutally violate people's rights.

<p>More than 100,000 East Timorese refugees remain under militia domination in 
West Timor and in early September militias murdered three international and 
two local UN refugee workers in Atambua, West Timor, as Indonesian police 
and soldiers stood by. Militias, well-armed and well-trained according to 
the UN, continue to infiltrate East Timor. On October 24, UN peacekeepers 
exchanged fire with well-equipped militias inside East Timor, killing one 
militia member.

<p>Earlier this week, Indonesia refused a UN request to extradite one of the 
most notorious militia leaders, Eurico Guterres. He is wanted in East Timor 
for his role in leading several brutal massacres preceding last year's 
independence vote. He is currently being held for questioning in Jakarta, 
accused of ordering followers not to cooperate with Indonesian efforts to 
disarm militias in West Timor this September, although a Jakarta court has 
ordered his release.

<p>The appropriations bill codifies for Fiscal Year 2001 much of the Clinton 
administration's temporary ban on military assistance to Indonesia first 
announced in September 1999 as the Indonesian military and its militias 
began their scorched earth campaign in the wake of East Timor's August 30 
vote for independence.

<p>Last spring, the U.S. military began a planned phased re-engagement with 
its Indonesian counterparts. Indonesian officers took part as observers in 
a U.S.-sponsored Cobra Gold military exercise in Thailand in May. In July, 
a joint U.S.-Indonesian exercise called CARAT/2000, in which the Indonesian 
navy and marines trained with their U.S. military counterparts, took place 
in East Java.

<p>Just prior to Secretary of Defense William Cohen's visit to Indonesia on 
September 17 and 18, the Pentagon said it had reinstated the U.S. 
suspension of all military assistance to Indonesia in the wake of 
escalating militia violence and the murder of U.S. citizen Carlos Caceres, 
who was working with refugees in West Timor.

<p>The foreign operations bill also calls for a detailed report of all 
overseas military training for foreign militaries conducted or planned by 
the Pentagon. This provision resulted from controversy over the Joint 
Combined Exchange Training (JCET) of the Indonesian military, which 
Representative Lane Evans (D-IL) and ETAN exposed in 1998.

<p>While the bill places strict conditions on renewing IMET (International 
Military and Education Training) and Foreign Military Financing for 
Indonesia, the bill continues the ban on full IMET even after those 
conditions are met. IMET for Indonesia has been restricted since 1992.

<p>The foreign operations bill also appropriates money to specifically support 
"economic rehabilitation" in Aceh where escalating human rights violations 
have displaced thousands despite a ceasefire, called a "humanitarian 
pause," between Jakarta and pro-independence guerrillas. This year 
Indonesian military and police have disappeared and killed hundreds in 
Aceh, including noted human rights advocates, with virtually no 
international presence to monitor and potentially deter such atrocities.

<p><i>The East Timor Action Network/US was founded in November 1991, following 
the massacre of more than 271 peaceful demonstrators in Dili, East Timor. 
ETAN/US supports genuine self-determination and human rights for the people 
of East Timor. ETAN has 27 local chapters.
