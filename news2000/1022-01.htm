- October 22 - On Tuesday, October 24 at 2 PM, representatives from local
and national organizations will join clergy, labor, and legislators in
delivering a clear message to Philadelphia’s District Attorney, Lynne Abraham
-- Stop wasting time and money on senseless prosecutions: Drop all charges
against the Republican Convention protestors!

<p>After a 2 PM press conference outside the D.A.’s office (1421 Arch Street in
downtown Philadelphia), a delegation will personally deliver to D.A. Abraham
over 100 letters supporting the protesters and condemning the city for its
assault on free speech. Trials for hundreds of RNC protesters will begin the
following day, Oct. 25.

<p>In one of the letters addressed to Mayor Street and D.A. Abraham, members of
U.S. Congress, concerned that the city’s actions may chill political dissent,
call for the immediate dropping of all charges.

<p>U.S. Congressman John Conyers (D-MI), ranking member of the House Judiciary
Committee, joins other Congressional co-signers in this letter addressed to
Philadelphia Mayor John Street and D.A. Abraham.  Their letter urges the city
to end its campaign to punish non-violent, peaceful protest.
 
<p>Local labor leaders, clergy, and over 80 local and national organizations will
deliver the D.A. letters of their own, calling upon the city to drop all
charges.

<p>Art Dougherty, President of the PA local of the American Postal Workers Union,
says, “The police response to [Convention] protests was disproportionately
harsh, and apparently aimed at preventing free expression.”

<p>“The city already went way over-budget on the convention, and these ridiculous
trials will add thousands if not millions of dollars to the cost of turning our
city over to the Republicans,” says Mark Rifkin, a graduate student at the
University of Pennsylvania who was arrested on August 1st and was in jail
for 10
days. “The city needs to spend its money on real issues  affordable housing,
health care, and education  not persecuting activists.”

<p>During the Republic National Convention on August 1st of this year, several
hundred activists were arrested for protesting, among other issues, the
criminal justice system and the lack of public discussion of human rights
abuses by the police and in U.S. prisons. Over 400 people, including
bystanders, legal observers, and medics, were rounded up by the police and held
for days on end, many waiting over 100 hours before being arraigned. All faced
enormous bails, ranging from $10,000 to $1 million, and were jailed for up to 2
weeks. They will be brought to trial over the next few months. Many of those
arrested are charged with multiple felonies, facing the possibility of decades
in prison. The arrests were for acts of civil disobedience, which typically
bring only summary charges.

<p>“This situation is unprecedented in this country’s history,” says Marina Sitrin
of the R2K Legal Collective.  “Never before has there been a concerted effort
to convict hundreds of protestors on such numerous, severe, and trumped-up
charges  all for using time-honored tactics of civil disobedience to try to
challenge and change the racism and classism of the criminal justice system.”

<p>Prior to, during, and after the week of the Republican Convention, police used
surveillance and infiltration, as well as targeting specific activists, in
order preemptively to disrupt political organizing and to silence political
dissent.  On multiple occasions, the Philadelphia police claimed not to be
involved in such covert activity, but investigative work by the Philadelphia
Inquirer later showed that the police had indeed relied heavily on information
gathered in this way.

<p align="center">--030--
<p>BACKGROUNDER

<p>TRIALS BEGIN WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25TH

<p>The first day of trials for hundreds of arrested activists is Wednesday,
October 25th, 2000 at noon.  Margaret Burns will be tried in Room 806 of the
Criminal Justice Center (13th & Filbert Streets) as the first defendant to face
multiple misdemeanor charges.  She will be followed by a handful of other
defendants scheduled for Thursday and Friday.  The bulk of the group or
consolidated trials will begin later in October and early November.

<p>Some of the scheduling depends on the conclusion of a series of motions being
introduced by R2K lawyers this week.  A motion for discovery, introduced last
week by the R2K legal team forced the continuance of many trials due to the
lack of preparedness on the part of the prosecution and the DA.  This week
arguments will be made on motions to suppress, selective prosecution, and
destruction of exculpatory evidence.

<p>CLAIMS OF MULTIPLE CIVIL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS AGAINST ACTIVISTS:
POLICE STAKED OUT, INFILTRATED ACTIVIST HOMES AND MEETINGS;

<p>There is comprehensive proof that, prior to the actions, police surveilled
activists’ houses and meetings, infiltrated activist groups, and interrogated
people about their plans for the Convention.  However, because criminal cases
are pending, much of this information cannot be discussed publicly.

<p>Acting on information obtained through illegal infiltration, police targeted
specific activists for pre-emptive arrests.  On August 1st, police surrounded a
puppet-making warehouse and arrested everyone inside, altogether over 70
activists who had been making signs and puppets for the demonstrations.  The
message that would have been communicated, a First Amendment right, was
confiscated and later destroyed by law enforcement.

<p>Protestors faced what may be the highest bails in history for misdemeanor
charges.  While a handful of people had bails as high as $500,000 and
$1,000,000, the majority of bails ranged from $10,000 to $50,000  still
outstandingly high for misdemeanor charges.  Protestors also face multiple
charges.  Instead of the customary citation for blocking a highway, protestors
are facing as many as twelve charges apiece, including conspiracy.  Many
charges are obviously false; for example, people arrested in the puppet
warehouse are charged with obstructing a highway.

<p>Several dozen protestors, as well as bystanders, were singled out for felony
charges, many for felony assault on police.  Such charges can bring
decades-long jail sentences.  The vast majority of these charges, if not all of
them, are trumped up efforts by police to cover up their own violent acts
toward protestors.

<p>Activists who set out to protest the criminal justice system experienced
first-hand some of the routine cruelty perpetrated by that system.  Arrested
protestors were denied food, water, and urgent medical needs.  They were
dragged, kicked, punched, and handcuffed so tightly as to cut off circulation. 
Some people were held for over 100 hours without being arraigned.

<p>WHY WERE ACTIVISTS ON THE STREETS AUGUST 1ST?

<p>The atrocities of the criminal justice system are numerous.  People were on the
streets August 1st in Philadelphia to call attention not only to the track
record of Candidate Bush on issues like state sanctioned executions, but on a
wide variety of dysfunction within a system that has not fared any better under
Democrat or Republican leadership.

<p>The August 1st Coalition, a group of activists engaging in non-violent direct
action, called for the following systemic changes: Freedom for Mumia Abu Jamal
and all political prisoners; abolishment of the Prison Industrial Complex;
abolishment of the death penalty; an end to police violence; and an end to the
corporate war on the poor.

<p>Nearly two million people are incarcerated in the US.  That’s more than any
other industrialized nation, and one quarter of the entire planet’s prison
population.  In 1995, black men were seven times more likely than white men to
be imprisoned, and still make up 47% of state and federal inmates.
