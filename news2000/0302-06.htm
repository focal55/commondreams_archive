- March 2 - This
          weekend the Christian Coalition is convening its first-ever national
          conference aimed at women. Titled &quot;Women Changing America,&quot;
          the event takes place in Arlington, Va., March 3-4.</font>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In
          promotional materials sent out in advance of the conference, Christian
          Coalition Executive Vice President Roberta Combs writes that the event
          &quot;will attract speakers and guest [sic] from across the nation who
          are concerned about America's moral climate and are ready to become
          involved in making a difference in America's future.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although
          men are not barred from attending the conference, all of the listed
          speakers are women, and session titles include &quot;The Role of the
          Retired Woman in Politics,&quot; &quot;Women in the 20th Century
          Conservative Movement&quot; and &quot;A Woman's Voice in Local
          Politics.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Observes
          Combs, &quot;While the last decade gave way to immoral leadership and
          open sin throughout much of America's society, a mobilized effort from
          Christians at the polls could create a positive change in this new
          decade for a return to righteousness across the country. I am sure you
          can share my concern for young families struggling to fight the evil
          pervading our society. This conference is the tool many women seek to
          learn how to protect their families, schools and neighborhoods from
          the violence, immorality and spiritual dangers that lurk in many
          American communities. As women unite in one purpose at this
          conference, an army of dedicated workers, impassioned and prepared for
          battle, will be formed to lift up their voices in government
          again.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The
          Christian Coalition seems to be undertaking a deliberate outreach to
          women. At the same time, there are signs that some other Religious
          Right groups are doing the same. What is behind this effort, and why
          is it happening now? Do American women agree with the Religious Right,
          and are their interests best served by organizations like the
          Christian Coalition?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This
          special report prepared by Americans United for Separation of Church
          and State examines these and other questions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Wooing
          Women: What's Behind The Coalition's New Drive</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite
          its claims to be &quot;non-partisan,&quot; the Christian Coalition is
          in fact a far-right organization that works to elect the most
          conservative candidates possible to public office. Through
          distribution of biased voter guides and other forms of partisan
          activity, the Coalition seeks to influence the political system, stack
          national, state and local offices with its followers and change U.S.
          laws on many issues.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given
          this, nearly every activity the Coalition undertakes has a political
          dimension. In the case of the &quot;Women Changing America&quot;
          conference, the political angle is easy to understand: Polling data
          shows that women are generally more liberal than men. In fact, women
          voters helped propel President Bill Clinton to victory in 1992 and
          1996, opening up a so-called &quot;gender gap&quot; that conservatives
          have been trying to close ever since. Additionally, many of the drives
          to keep abortion legal, make access to contraceptives convenient and
          win a place for sex education in the public schools have been led by
          women.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But
          Religious Right strategists believe the political winds may be
          shifting and seem eager to seize the opportunity. Last year the
          liberal Center for Gender Equality issued a poll indicating that a
          slight majority of American women favor greatly restricting access to
          abortion or outlawing it entirely and that 36 percent agree that
          &quot;wives should submit graciously to their husbands.&quot; The poll
          also found that twice as many women believe the Christian Coalition
          works &quot;in the interest of women&quot; than think it is a threat.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The
          survey's startling findings have been questioned. Other polls have not
          shown a majority of women adopting anti-choice views on abortion or
          taking positions in sympathy with the Religious Right. A survey of
          women by the website www.iVillage.com taken last November, for
          example, found that only 4 percent of the respondents said they
          consider themselves part of the Religious Right.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless,
          Religious Right leaders were quick to trumpet the results of the
          Center for Gender Equality poll. Randy Tate, then executive director
          of the Coalition, said the findings prove his group is mainstream.
          Other Religious Right activists made the results into large,
          poster-sized charts that they displayed at national meetings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's
          also worth noting that in working to mobilize more women, the
          Coalition is merely taking advantage of an untapped resource. A survey
          undertaken by the organization six years ago showed that 48 percent of
          the group's membership is female. Although throughout most of its
          11-year existence the Coalition was led by men, in recent months the
          groups has undergone a leadership crisis, and most of the top staff
          has departed. Robertson's chief Coalition lieutenant is now Combs, a
          South Carolina activist who serves as executive vice president.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's
          also worth noting that women have long been active in Religious Right
          groups. Singer Anita Bryant ushered in the modern era of Religious
          Right gay bashing in the 1970s, and about the same time Phyllis
          Schlafly's Eagle Forum shifted from rabid anti-Communism to an effort
          to beat back the Equal Rights Amendment. In the 1980s, Beverly LaHaye
          founded Concerned Women for America, a Washington, D.C.-based
          Religious Right group that likes to call itself the largest women's
          organization in the country.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More
          recently, when Gary Bauer stepped down from the Family Research
          Council last year to run for president, he named right-wing radio talk
          show host Janet Parshall as the FRC's chief spokesperson. Janet Folger,
          an anti-abortion activist from Ohio, now runs TV preacher D. James
          Kennedy's Center for Reclaiming America in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Even
          TV preacher Pat Robertson's wife, Adelia, has been getting in on the
          act lately. Adelia Robertson, who usually goes by the name &quot;Dede,&quot;
          spoke at last year's Christian Coalition &quot;Road to Victory&quot;
          Conference and is slated to address this month's &quot;Women Changing
          America Conference.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In
          His Own Words: Robertson's View Of Women</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some
          might consider Robertson's outreach to women ironic, given his long
          track record of anti-women rhetoric. Robertson, a Southern Baptist who
          practices a Pentecostal theology, has long advocated the
          fundamentalist view that women are required by the Bible to submit to
          men. He believes that in a marriage, the husband is to rule and has
          stated that women have no right to take a leadership role in churches.
          In addition, Robertson has endorsed the Promise Keepers, an
          evangelical men's group known for its promotion of wifely submission.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over
          the years Robertson has unleashed a string of attacks on women's
          rights and feminism. He has also argued that wives must submit to
          their husbands. A sampling of Robertson's comments on women follows:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          On his nationally televised &quot;700 Club&quot; television program,
          Robertson has repeatedly stressed the theme of wifely submission. On
          Jan. 8, 1982, he said, &quot;I know that this is painful for you
          ladies to hear, but if you get married, you accept the headship of a
          man, your husband. Christ if the head of the household, and the
          husband is the head of the wife. And that's just the way it is. This
          is the way the Bible set it up.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          Speaking on the &quot;700 Club&quot; Nov. 28, 1989, Robertson
          dismissed feminism, strongly implying that women just aren't as smart
          as men. He cited chess as the proof for this idea, saying,
          &quot;There's never been a woman grand master chess player. And if,
          you know, once you get one, then I'll buy into some of the feminism,
          but until that point....&quot; (In fact, there were two women chess
          grand masters when Robertson made that comment; since then, at least
          three others have joined their ranks.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          In his 1984 book <i>Answers to 200 of Life's Most Probing Questions</i>,
          Robertson writes that the Bible mandates that women refrain from
          becoming religious leaders. He asserts that women can work in other
          occupations but insists, &quot;in the government of the family and the
          church, men are to be the leaders. These two institutions are a type
          of God's universal fatherhood that must be adhered to.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          In his 1993 book <i>The Turning Tide</i> Robertson writes, &quot;[T]he
          ultimate spiritual direction for the family is to come from God
          through the husband. The wife is to recognize her husband's role and
          submit to his wisdom in matters where there may be disagreement.&quot;
          He goes on to write, &quot;[T]he radical women's movement of the 1960s
          and 1970s has not been geared for reform, but destruction. It has
          turned fanatical and ugly. These women launched programs that were
          anti-God, anti-capitalism, anti-family, anti-birth and
          anti-heterosexual....This movement was not about women's rights, it
          was about virulent hatred against anything having to do with
          males.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          On July 6, 1995, Robertson, speaking on the &quot;700 Club,&quot;
          argued that husbands do their wives a favor by keeping them in
          submission. &quot;[T]he woman should be in submission to the man as
          under the Lord...,&quot; he said. &quot;People who speak the biblical
          truth are reviled and ridiculed.... What woman wouldn't want a man who
          was willing to die for her? What woman wouldn't want a man who puts
          her interests ahead of his? What woman wouldn't want a man who was
          willing to do anything possible to bless her and cherish her and
          nurture her and look after her? In those circumstances, wouldn't the
          woman be delighted to say, 'I acknowledge your headship because God is
          head of you and together we are one flesh?'&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          Robertson's most bizarre -- and perhaps most offensive -- comment
          about women's rights occurred in 1992, when his Christian Coalition
          was busy trying to defeat a state Equal Rights Amendment in Iowa. In a
          fund-raising letter, Robertson wrote, &quot;The feminist agenda is not
          about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist, anti-family
          political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill
          their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become
          lesbians.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*
          Robertson defended the Southern Baptist Convention after it approved a
          controversial resolution on women in June of 1998. The SBC statement
          reads in part, &#147;A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the
          church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to
          protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself
          graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church
          willingly submits to the leadership of Christ. She, being in the image
          of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given
          responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in
          managing the household and nurturing the next generation....
          Wives...were created to be 'helpers' to their husbands. A wife's
          submission to her husband does not decrease her worth but rather
          enhances her value to her husband and to the Lord.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Robertson's
          Views: Out Of Step With Women's Concerns</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Polls
          show that most women are concerned about issues like strengthening
          public education, improving access to health care and finding
          affordable child care. The Christian Coalition constantly bashes
          public education and promotes private school voucher schemes.
          Reforming the health care system and increasing access to quality,
          affordable child care have not been on the Coalition's radar screen,
          but given Robertson's well known antipathy toward government programs,
          it's a safe bet he would oppose greater government involvement in both
          areas.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many
          women are also concerned about keeping abortion safe and legal.
          Robertson and the Coalition have worked to undermine this principle in
          state after state. Some of Robertson's harshest, most extreme rhetoric
          is aimed at legal abortion. He has several times compared legal
          abortion to the Nazi Holocaust. Speaking to Coalition activists in
          1995 during the annual &quot;Road to Victory&quot; meeting in
          Washington, for example, Robertson said that by the year 2000 seven
          times as many &quot;innocent people&quot; will have been killed
          through abortion in America than perished in the Holocaust. He called
          for a constitutional amendment or &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to
          stop legal abortion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In
          recent years, Robertson has even stepped up his opposition to birth
          control. Addressing attendees of a Christian Coalition meeting in
          Atlanta in September of 1997, Robertson blasted <i>Griswold v.
          Connecticut</i>, a landmark 1965 ruling by the Supreme Court that
          struck down a state law that banned contraceptives for anyone -- even
          married couples. The reasoning behind <i>Griswold</i>, Robertson told
          the crowd, &quot;was made up out of whole cloth.&quot; Said Robertson
          of the ruling, &quot;I want to see it abolished.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robertson
          is also a supporter of diverting tax money to religious groups to
          provide social services. Many critics believe that the Religious Right
          would like to shift social service spending to sectarian agencies for
          the short term, with the larger goal of getting government out of the
          job of providing these services at all. Robertson, for example, has
          derided the various government programs that were created in the 1960s
          as &quot;wasteful.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women
          may have a special reason to be concerned about the shift of social
          services from the public to the religious sector. Statistically
          speaking, most single-parent households are headed by women. Many of
          these households live at or below the poverty line. Since these types
          of households are the ones most likely to need social services, they
          will bear the brunt if problems arise once these services are shifted
          from the public sector to religious organizations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Robertson's
          Attacks on Public Education</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National
          polls show that women voters place a higher premium on the issue of
          education than men voters. Two years ago, a poll by the American
          Association of University Women found that the vast majority of women
          favor more federal involvement in education and oppose diverting tax
          dollars to religious schools.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only
          29 percent of the women surveyed favored voucher plans to fund private
          education. Sixty-six percent opposed such plans and said that public
          money should go only to public schools.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robertson
          has repeatedly blasted federal involvement in education and strongly
          promotes voucher plans. In his 1993 book <i>The Turning Tide,</i>
          Robertson conceded that voucher plans may spell the end of public
          education but went to write, &quot;So what? For all we've been getting
          for our tax dollars out of the public schools, they should have
          disappeared years ago.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Conclusion:
          The Christian Coalition--No Friend of Women</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time
          after time, the Christian Coalition's agenda fails to match the needs
          and wants of American women. There's no doubt that the Christian
          Coalition is trying to bring more women into its fold, but women
          should reject the overture.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The
          Religious Right has a basic contempt for the progress women have made
          over the past century,&quot; says the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive
          director of Americans United. &quot;Its policies, if adopted, would
          return women to a time when their choices were limited and many of
          their personal decisions were made by someone else. There is simply no
          way you can call an agenda like that 'pro-woman.'&quot;<br>
