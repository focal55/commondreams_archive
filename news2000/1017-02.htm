- October 17 - Ralph Nader today filed suit in the
United States District Court in Massachusetts against the Commission on
Presidential Debates for unlawfu1ly preventing him from accessing a
viewing room during the first presidential debate at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston Oct. 3. Nader announced the lawsuit from St.
Louis, hours before the third and final presidential debate was set to
get underway without his participation.

<p>The suit charges that the Commission on Presidential Debates, by using
state police power to exclude Nader from entering a separate viewing
auditorium at UMass for which he had a transferable ticket of
admittance, and by preventing him from appearing at a pre-scheduled
interview with Fox News at the debate site, violated federal law and the
Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.

<p>Defendants named in the suit are the Commission on Presidential Debates;
co-chairmen Paul G. Kirk, Jr. and Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr.; security
consultant John Vezeris, who barred Nader’s entrance to the campus on
behalf of the Commission; and three state police officers present on the
scene. The defendants used threats, intimidation and coercion to prevent
Nader from entering the campus, which is a violation of the
Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. The actions were also in violation of
the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of free association, freedom of
speech, and equal protection under the law.

<p>“Mr. Nader was treated differently from all others in violation of his
right to free association and equal protection under the law merely
because of his political position, his affiliation with the Green Party,
his criticism of the Commission and of the Democratic and Republican
parties, their candidates and their corporate sponsorships, and because
of his public positions that are contrary to the two party message being
conveyed by the Commission and its agents,” the lawsuit states.

<p>The suit arose from an event that took place during the first of three
televised presidential debates staged by the bi-partisan,
corporate-funded debate commission. For the Oct. 3 debate at UMass,
Nader had a ticket to access a viewing room separate from the debate
auditorium. Nader planned to view the debate and then appear as an
invited guest on the Fox News Channel to comment on the debate in a live
broadcast at the site.

<p>When Nader arrived at the campus, he was stopped by Vezeris and three
state troopers. Vezeris stated repeatedly that he was “instructed by the
Commission” to advise Nader that “it’s already been decided that,
whether or not you have a ticket, you are not invited.”

<p>Nader was threatened with arrest if he remained on the premises. When
Nader tried to go to the Fox News facility at the campus for the
pre-scheduled television appearance, he was stopped a second time by the
police officers and again threatened with arrest.

<p>“As a result of this incident, Mr. Nader was … unable to present his
views as the Green Party candidate to television and other media viewers
immediately after the debate when viewership was at its height, and he
was prevented from presenting his views to the 1,700 journalists from
around the world who were at the debate site,” the lawsuit states.

<p>Nader announced the lawsuit at a press conference today in St. Louis,
after which he planned to address the “O17” demonstrators – a broad
range of groups protesting the Anheuser-Busch-sponsored, St. Louis
debate, which is the last in a series of scripted presidential debates
that have allowed George W. Bush and Al Gore to ignore many issues and
abuses of power that are of deep concern to the American people.

<p>“The high-handed tactics used by the Commission on Presidential Debates
signal the downfall of this private company that is undermining
democracy at the direction of the Democrats, Republicans and their
corporate sponsors,” Nader said. “Polls show that the majority of
Americans want to see a four-way presidential debate, yet I have been
excluded by two parties that are intent upon silencing political
competition. By denying me entrance to the viewing room and preventing
me from appearing in a televised interview with Fox News, the Commission
has committed an indefensible act of arrogant power.”

<p>Nader said he will help establish, both directly and by encouraging
other media, labor and civic sponsors, an independent people’s debate
commission controlled by citizens who will organize presidential
debates, in the interest of voter education -- rather than in the
interest of preserving the two-party duopoly.

<p>Nader is represented in the lawsuit by the law offices of Howard
Friedman; and Adkins, Kelston & Zavez, P.C.

<p>Nader is also a plaintiff in a suit against the Federal Election
Commission challenging the legality of the agency’s regulations
permitting the corporate funding of the Commission on Presidential
Debates. That lawsuit was heard on expedited appeal by the First Circuit
Court of Appeals in Boston on Oct. 5.
