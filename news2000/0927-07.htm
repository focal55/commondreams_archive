- September 27 - On October 17, 2000 in St. Louis, Missouri, only two of the major contenders
for the office of President of the United States will meet for a debate
organized by the corporately funded Commission on Presidential Debates.&nbsp;
The o17 Coalition (See enclosed list of over 40 student, community and
national organizations.) will hold its "Where’s the Debate?" Rally outside
this debate.
<p>Members of the coalition believe the Democratic and Republican candidates
have either ignored or share the same positions on fundamental issues concerning
race, economics, military and foreign policy and the environment. (See
enclosed Issues Statement). O17 organizers point to the corporate funding
of the Democratic and Republican parties as a primary source of their refusal
to address these issues.
<p>The "Where’s the Debate?" Rally is designed to provide citizens with
a forum to exercise democracy, call for an open debate and place fundamental
issues before the public and candidates.
<p>The "Where’s the Debate?" Rally will be held on October 17 from 4-8
PM on a field overlooking the Washington University Field House, the debate
site, (SW corner of Big Bend and Forsyth).&nbsp; Participants will march
to the rally sight at 3:30 PM from Grace United Methodist Church (Skinker
and Waterman).&nbsp; March route will be announced in subsequent releases.
<p>As the rally outside concludes and the ‘debate" inside begins, rally
participants will then dawn gags, some reading "justice silenced," and
placards naming the issues and people excluded from the debate.&nbsp; They
will march away from the debate in silence and candle-light.&nbsp; The
proposed route is south on Big Bend, then east on Wydown, ending in Forest
Park.
<p>During the week prior to the "Where’s the Debate?" Rally, the o17 Coalition
and it member organizations will sponsor nonviolent direct actions and
forums addressing fundamental issues excluded from the debate. A schedule
of the actions and forums will follow in a subsequent releases.
<p>Key organizers of the 017 Coalition’s "Where’s the Debate?" Rally are
available for interviews and appearances. Call contact persons listed above
to arrange interviews and appearances.&nbsp; On October 4 and 10, the O17
Coalition will release "issue based" evaluations of the presidential debates
in Boston and Winston-Salem, along with updates on the St. Louis rally,
featured speakers, and related events.

<p><b>O17 Coalition Issues Statement</b>
<p>On October 17, 2000 in St. Louis, Missouri, only two of the major contenders
for the presidency will meet for a debate organized by the corporately
funded Commission&nbsp; on Presidential Debates. They will stand behind
podiums sponsored by a large local corporation.&nbsp; And they will say
only what their campaign contributors have paid them to say.&nbsp; Because
the Democratic and Republican candidates and their debate commission share
the same corporate sponsors, they lack the will to differ on fundamental
issues concerning race, economics, military and the environment.&nbsp;
It’s up to citizens to exercise democracy and place those issues before
the public and candidates.&nbsp; Here are some crucial examples:
<p>Where is the debate on racism and justice…
<br>
&middot; The war on drugs has resulted in the incarceration of millions
of people of color. Over three-quarters of those imprisoned for drug offenses
are African Americans, even though there is no difference in drug use across
races. Meanwhile, the corporate prison-industrial complex profits from
the building and operating new prisons. Who will end this war against poor,
young Americans of color, and order the release of 400,000 nonviolent drug
offenders from U.S. prison?&nbsp; Who will stop building prisons and invest
in a massive expansion of drug rehabilitation programs?
<p>&middot; Two-thirds of death row inmates who are eventually found innocent
are African Americans. People of color are the primary victims of police
abuse. Meanwhile corporately-funded candidates manipulate fears of crime
and racial stereotypes for political gain. Who will call for the complete
overhaul of this racist criminal justice system that has been condemned
by human rights group and democracies around the world?&nbsp; Who will
call for the abolition of the death penalty?
<p>&middot; Millions of African-Americans continue to suffer economic disadvantages
as the result of over 300 years of legalized slavery and segregation in
the U.S. Today the average assets of white U.S. families are $60,000 while
the assets of the average African American family are $8,000. Meanwhile
corporations continue to benefit from the wealth produced by that legacy
of slavery and continued discrimination .&nbsp; Who will support John Conyers’
House Resolution which seeks official acknowledgment of these long-standing
inequities and establishes a commission to explore remedies?
<p>Where is the debate on economic injustices…
<br>
&middot; Forty-five million are without health care insurance, while
corporations privatize and consolidate their control over health care delivery.&nbsp;
Who will call for a universal single-payer health-care system, guaranteeing
equal access to all?
<p>&middot; Tens of millions work in factories and fields for wages that
don’t pay the bills, while global corporations authorized by free trade
agreements and World Trade Organization rules roam the world in search
of the lowest possible wages, working conditions and environmental standards.
Who will call for a living wage at home and challenge sweatshops abroad?
Who will allow the workers and indigenous people to control the impact
of globalization on their lives? Who will link trade to human rights compliance?
<p>&middot; Dozens of poor countries spend more money servicing their debts
to banks than they spend on education and health, while global corporations
benefit from conditions placed on these debtor nations by the IMF or World
Bank. Who will call for debt relief for the world’s poorest countries?
Who will insist that any conditions attached to new loans be designed to
break the cycle of poverty, not perpetuate it?
<p>Where is the debate on just foreign and military policies…
<br>
&middot; Over 500,000 children have died of malnutrition and curable
diseases as a result of a decade of economic sanctions on Iraq, while U.S.
corporations continue to enjoy favorable access to Middle Eastern oil.&nbsp;
Who will lift economic sanctions on Iraq?
<p>&middot; In the past five years, over 3,000 civilians, many from indigenous
communities, have been killed by paramilitary forces linked to the Colombian
military, while U.S. corporations drill for oil on indigenous land throughout
Colombia. Who will halt all U.S. aid to the Colombian military and its
paramilitary collaborators?
<p>&middot; A proposed U.S. missile defense system increases the likelihood
of a new nuclear arms race.&nbsp; The U.S. continues to be the world’s
largest arms merchant, while corporate military contractors vie for lucrative
deals to develop and build new weapons. Who will halt research and production
of missile defense programs and suspend foreign military sales?
<p>Where is the debate on environmental threats…
<br>
&middot; Our food, air and water is endangered by genetic engineering,
environmentally reckless trade polices, and the building of new highways,
while corporations profit from patents on seeds, the absence of environmental
standards in global trade, and the heavy reliance on automobiles.&nbsp;
Who will stand against genetic engineering of food, crops, and seeds, insist
on global clean air and water standards, and devote more resources to mass
transit?
