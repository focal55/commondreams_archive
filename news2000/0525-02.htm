- May 25 - A fact formerly heard only in stuffy civics classes has suddenly become, for the NRA and the likes of Pat Robertson, the "right" stuff of year-2000 political motivational speeches: The President appoints justices to the Supreme Court, and the next President may well get the chance to appoint 2,3 or even 4. Not only are three of the Justices 70 or older, but with Court vacancies occurring, on average, once every two years, and with none on the current Court since 1994, we’re statistically overdue.
    </font>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      The NRA, Pat Robertson, and others on the far right are direct about what they want &#150; more justices like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas &#150; the same justices who have been identified by Governor George W. Bush, in a broad wink toward his party’s right flank, as the kind he would seek to put on the Court.
    </font></p>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The radical right is right about one thing &#150; the Supreme Court holds the key to the future of many of the freedoms that Americans have come to take for granted over the past half century," said Ralph G. Neas, President of People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF). "With the Court just one or two votes away from curtailing or abolishing many of those rights, the stakes couldn’t be higher."
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      A new report released today by PFAWF details what the far right’s "dream team" for the Supreme Court would mean &#150; and the picture it paints is chilling. "Courting Disaster: How a Scalia-Thomas Supreme Court Would Endanger our Rights and Freedoms," documents the devastating impact that a further rightward shift on the U.S. Supreme Court would have.
    </font></p>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Courting Disaster" reports on PFAWF’s six-month-long examination of the concurring and dissenting opinions of the Supreme Court’s two most right-wing justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, on civil rights, reproductive rights, privacy, separation of church and state, worker and consumer rights, environmental protection, and other issues. The 80-page report concludes that a Scalia-Thomas majority on the Court would overturn decades of established precedent, sharply curtailing or abolishing rights and freedoms that many Americans have come to count on.
    </font></p>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We want all Americans, regardless of party affiliation, liberal or conservative, to understand what is at stake," said Neas. "We want all Americans to know that many freedoms they take for granted are being eroded, or are protected by fragile one- or two- vote majorities on the Supreme Court. We want them to know that as a country we are courting constitutional catastrophe."
    </font></p>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the far right succeeds in remaking the Court in the image of Scalia and Thomas, the result would be a disaster for millions of Americans," said Neas. "Everyone understands that a Scalia-Thomas Supreme Court would roll back abortion rights, but this report also shows many more danger areas that have until now been under the radar &#150; voting rights, sex discrimination and sexual harassment, religious liberty, workplace rights, environmental protection, campaign finance reform &#150; all the rules could be rewritten by a Supreme Court hostile to these rights and issues."
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      It wouldn’t take four or even three Supreme Court appointments for the far right’s wish list to be reflected in the Court’s rulings. The report documents how adding just one or two Justices who share Scalia’s and Thomas’ far-right legal philosophy to an already conservative Court could tip the balance on the Court for decades to come by overruling important Court precedents, in whole or in part. For example:
    </font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Privacy:</b> If the Court overturns <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, thus ending abortion rights, it could also endanger other rights that depend on the right to privacy, including the most intensely personal health care decisions ranging from contraception to "living wills" that people create to have their wishes carried out in the event of incapacitation.
        </font></li>
<li>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Civil Rights:</b> In their written opinions Scalia and Thomas have advocated extreme positions such as that the Voting Rights Act shouldn’t apply to elections for state judges, prohibitions on sex discrimination shouldn’t apply to jury selection, and disabled persons shouldn’t be protected from unnecessary institutionalization under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
        </font></li>
<li>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Religious Liberty:</b> Scalia and Thomas would hand the far right a victory they have sought for the past two decades and more &#150; by dismantling the wall between church and state. A Court with just one or two more far right justices would allow government-sponsored prayer at school events and in other settings, and would even allow school district lines to be drawn so as to make one religious sect dominant.
        </font></li>
<li>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Workers’ Rights:</b> A Scalia-Thomas Court would sharply reduce workers’ rights by, for example, eliminating protections against firing for such offenses as belonging to the wrong political party or for a private comment to a co-worker.
        </font></li>
<li>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Campaign Finance Reform:</b> A Scalia-Thomas Court would overturn the part of the 1976 <i>Buckley v. Valeo</i> ruling that the far right opposes, thus eliminating limits on contributions to campaigns.
        </font></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Judicial Veto</b>
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      The report also analyzes a troubling trend toward on the current Court to use 5-4 rulings as a veto to overturn acts of Congress on "federalism" or states’ rights grounds. Such decisions by the Court have advanced the NRA’s interests by striking down parts of the Brady Bill and the Gun Free School Zones Act. The judicial veto has been used to limit Congress’ ability to protect people from age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment act. On May 15, the Court again wielded the judicial veto to strike down the part of the Violence Against Women Act that provides federal protections against sexual assault and violence.
    </font></p>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The judicial veto is being used to limit Americans’ fundamental freedoms by restricting Congress’ power to pass certain kinds of legislation, much as the Court did in the period leading up to the constitutional crisis of 1937, when the Court was overturning New Deal legislation," said Neas. "A Scalia-Thomas majority would take this dangerous trend to even greater extremes and lock up Congress’ ability to protect Americans rights and freedoms for decades to come."
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      At the news conference, PFAWF also discussed information learned about the public’s views of the Court from some recent focus groups conducted by Lake, Snell, Perry &amp; Associates and overseen by Celinda Lake. Focus group participants said that the Supreme Court is important enough that they wanted to understand its role in greater depth. That interest was heightened when they learned that three of the nine justices may be replaced by the next U.S. President, and that those three justices could swing the court’s rulings in key areas, including reproductive choice, civil rights, privacy, and gun control.
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      Focus group participants were concerned about the potential for a Court that is thrown out of balance by extremist appointments. They were aware, even without knowing details about the nomination process, that the Court is linked to the President. They wanted to be presented with clear, factual information about the link between the Court and the issues they cared about.
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      PFAWF announced that it is launching a massive national public education campaign around the information in "Courting Disaster." This effort will include wide distribution of this information to PFAWF members, allies, and to the public through our website. Town meetings, public forums and debates are being planned around the country to raise public awareness about the importance of the Court.
    </font></p>
<p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Elections always provide us with a teachable moment," said Neas. "This year, thanks to the right-wing’s very visible attempted takeover of the Supreme Court, we have an opportunity to have a real conversation with the American people about the importance of the Court and how an out-of-control Court could affect the daily lives of all of us, our children and our grandchildren."
