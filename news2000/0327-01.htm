- March 27 -  What goes into garbage cans is 
just the tip of a giant mountain of wasted 
resources piling up everyday, according to a 
new study released today.  While Americans are 
setting new recycling records, product and 
packaging waste is increasing at the same time.

<p>At a news conference at Los Angeles City Hall, 
a coalition of recycling experts was joined by 
Councilmembers Ruth Galanter and Mark Ridley-
Thomas to announce that while Los Angeles has 
achieved a 47 percent reduction in the City's 
waste-stream, a lot more can be done to reduce 
the ever-growing mountain of trash produced 
nationwide.

<p>"By practicing the 3 R's - Reduce, Reuse, 
Recycle - Americans kept 28 percent of 
municipal refuse out of landfills and 
incinerators in 1997, nearly triple the 
recycling rate in 1980.  The biggest benefits 
from keeping these materials out of landfills 
comes from reduced pollution, energy saved, 
reduced habitat destruction and sustainable 
jobs," Rick Best, president of the GrassRoots 
Recycling Network, said.

<p>"Paper recycled by Americans since 1990 saved 
more than 3 billion trees, the equivalent of a 
forest 16 times the size of Yosemite National 
Park," said Best.  "Local government led the 
way, which is the reason for releasing our 
report here today.  Nationally, we spent $43.5 
billion on garbage disposal last year, burying 
or burning vast amounts of resources that could 
be reused or recycled.  Many cutting edge 
businesses and communities are already cutting 
their waste in half," Best said.

<p>The GrassRoots Recycling Network (GRRN) 
released Wasting and Recycling in the United 
States 2000 today.  The report provides a 
comprehensive review of progress in recycling 
and environmental impacts of wasting resources, 
and presents a strategy for eliminating waste.  
It was researched and written by the Washington 
DC-based Institute for Local Self-Reliance 
(ILSR).

<p>"Los Angeles expects to meet California's goal 
of keeping 50 percent of waste out of landfills 
in 2000 through waste prevention, reuse and 
recycling," Los Angeles Mayor Richard J. 
Riordan said in a statement issued by his 
office today.  "By the year 2020 we plan to 
reach a 70 percent waste reduction goal," said 
Riordan.

<p>"It makes economic and environmental sense, 
saving millions of dollars for taxpayers, 
creating good paying jobs in the City of Los 
Angeles and assuring a healthy future for our 
children," Riordan said.

<p>"Unfortunately, our recycling efforts 
nationally have been one step forward, one step 
back," Brenda Platt, lead author of the report 
and Director of Materials Recovery at the 
Institute for Local Self-Reliance, said in an 
interview from her office.

<p>"More than 9,300 communities provided curbside 
recycling by 1998, compared to a handful in the 
1970s.  An estimated 150 million Americans 
recycle," Platt said.

<p>"While recycling increased, wasting in 
landfills and incinerators is much greater and 
increased by 4.4 million tons between 1996 and 
1997," Platt said.  The analysis was based on 
data from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency and other published sources.

<p>"Waste generated from residential and 
commercial sources is just the tip of the 
'wasteburg.'  For every garbage can placed at 
the curb, the equivalent of another 71 garbage 
cans worth of waste is created in mining, 
logging, agriculture, oil and gas exploration, 
and the industrial processes converting raw 
materials into finished products and 
packaging," GRRN Network Coordinator Bill 
Sheehan said.

<p>Dr. Sheehan, a biologist, leads the 4-year-old 
national nonprofit organization based in 
Athens, Georgia.  GRRN's report and programs 
are funded by the Turner Foundation, the Merck 
Family Fund, The Florence and John Schumann 
Foundation, and individual gifts.

<p>"One of the key findings of our research is 
that the benefits of recycling are also far 
greater than previously thought and go far 
beyond keeping materials from landfill disposal 
or incineration," Dr. Neil Seldman, co-author 
of the report and president of the ILSR, said 
from Washington DC.  Seldman is a co-founder of 
GRRN and a member of its board of directors.

<p>Key benefits of recycling identified in the 
report include:

<p>* Reducing greenhouse gases.  Reaching a 35 
percent recycling rate and reducing wasting to 
1990 levels would eliminate 11.4 million metric 
tons of carbon equivalent (MTCE).  This is 
equivalent to taking nearly 7 million cars off 
the road.

<p>* Reducing reliance on virgin resources 
protects habitats and eliminates pollution from 
extracting resources, processing and 
manufacturing.  Producing aluminum from bauxite 
is highly energy intensive and generates a ton 
of caustic waste for every ton of bauxite 
mined.  Recovering the more than 45 billion 
aluminum cans wasted in 1998 in the U.S. would 
conserve enough energy to supply the 
electricity needed by the city of Atlanta for 
two years.

<p>* Creating sustainable jobs and businesses.  A 
survey by ten northeastern states found that 
industries manufacturing with recycled 
materials employ 103,413 people in the region.  
North Carolina recycling industries employ over 
8,700 people.  California is expected to create 
45,000 recycling jobs when it reaches 50 
percent waste reduction and recycling goal.

<p>Wasting and Recycling in the United States 2000 
identifies several factors adversely affecting 
recycling and waste reduction, including:

<p>* Corporations backing away from commitments to 
use recycled materials in products and 
packaging.

<p>* Subsidies for virgin resource extraction and 
waste disposal which put recycling at a 
competitive disadvantage, including $2.6 
billion annually in federal taxpayer subsidies 
and billions more spent by local governments 
supporting landfills and incinerators.

<p>* Products and packaging are often made with 
little regard for recycling and waste 
prevention.  For example, new plastic beverage 
containers are made with colored resins or 
labels and caps making recycling technically 
more difficult and expensive.

<p>Los Angeles City Council Member Ruth Galanter 
said "Local governments and taxpayers are being 
confronted with wasteful new packaging which 
costs more to recycle.  The trend toward 
plastics is a real problem because the cost of 
collecting and recycling the containers is 
often more than what companies pay us for the 
plastic, and our taxpayers end up with the 
bill."

<p>"I am introducing a resolution tomorrow calling 
on Coca-Cola to take back its plastic bottles 
and use them to make new bottles.  Coke and 
other beverage companies that fail to use 
significant amounts of recycled plastic in 
their bottles, burden local government and 
taxpayers who pay for litter clean-up, landfill 
disposal or subsidize the cost of recycling 
their bottles," Galanter said.

<p>Wasting and Recycling in the United States 2000 
documents that many businesses and communities 
are setting records in recycling and waste 
reduction.  "Fifteen years ago, 25 percent 
recycling was thought to be the limit or to 
reach higher would mean astronomical costs.  
Today we know otherwise.  Hundreds of 
businesses and communities have cut their waste 
in half and saved money," said ILSR's Platt.

<p>"Fetzer Vineyards is one California business 
that has cut its waste by more than 80 
percent," she said.

<p>GRRN lays out a new approach based upon 
eliminating rather than managing waste.   "Zero 
waste is our goal.  Cutting edge businesses and 
communities are already pursuing innovative 
'zero waste' strategies in the United States 
and half way around the world in Australia and 
New Zealand," said Bill Sheehan.

<p>"We have only scratched the surface of 
recycling's potential in the United States.  
Every day another city achieves cost effective 
diversion rates well above the national average 
and new markets, program and processing 
strategies demonstrate success," Joan Edwards 
said at the Los Angeles news conference.  
Edwards, a private consultant, is the former 
director of recycling programs for the cities 
of Los Angeles and New York.  

<p>GRRN's report shows that keys to successful 
waste reduction and recycling are setting 
public policy goals, backed by mandates or 
incentives like beverage container deposits, 
and creating incentives for market-based 
solutions.

<p>"The heart of the zero waste strategy is based 
on the old adage that 'an ounce of prevention 
is worth a pound of cure,'" said Sheehan.

<p>The GrassRoots Recycling Network is a North 
American network of recycling and community-
based activists who advocate policies and 
practices to achieve zero waste, to end 
corporate welfare for waste, and to create 
sustainable jobs from discards.  GRRN was 
founded in 1995 by members of the Sierra Club 
Solid Waste Committee, the Institute for Local 
Self-Reliance and the California Resource 
Recovery Association.

<p>Copies of Wasting and Recycling in the United 
States 2000 are available for $25.00 postpaid.
