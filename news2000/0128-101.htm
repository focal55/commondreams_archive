- January 28 - Television preacher D. James Kennedy
          aired a nationwide television special Jan. 23, 2000, that attacked the
          separation of church and state. During the hour-long edition of his
          &quot;Coral Ridge Hour,&quot; Kennedy maligned the concept of
          church-state separation numerous times, calling it, among other
          things, &quot;one of the greatest deceptions of the 20th
          century.&quot;          </font>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kennedy's analysis was full of
          standard Religious Right distortions about the separation of church
          and state and contained numerous inaccuracies. This document, prepared
          by Americans United for Separation of Church and State looks at some
          of Kennedy's biggest mistakes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><span style="font-weight:normal">Kennedy
          asserted that the separation of church and state was intended to bar
          only the establishment of a national church.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: No serious scholar of the
          Constitution or the Bill of Right believes this. The historical record
          and the debate over the wording of the First Amendment show clearly
          that the amendment was intended to prevent government from endorsing
          or promoting specific religious denominations or religion generally.
          Early drafts of the First Amendment that specifically barred only the
          establishment of a national church were rejected as too weak. Clearly,
          the Founding Fathers had something more far-reaching in mind, which is
          why the First Amendment says in part, &quot;Congress shall make no law
          respecting an establishment of religion....&quot;<br style="mso-special-character:
line-break">
          <br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
          <i><span style="font-weight:normal">Kennedy said that James Madison,
          the acknowledged Father of the Constitution, believed the First
          Amendment was designed only to bar a national church.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: This claim is false, as
          Madison's actions and writings prove. As president, Madison vetoed two
          bills that he said would violate the First Amendment--a measure giving
          federal land to a church and a proposal to officially incorporate an
          Episcopal church in Washington. In his veto messages, Madison
          specifically stated that he believed both bills would run afoul of the
          First Amendment. Madison would not have made these statements if he
          believed all the First Amendment did was bar the establishment of a
          national church. In writings after he left office, Madison made clear
          his support for church-state separation and an expansive
          interpretation of the First Amendment.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kennedy stated that,
          &quot;Nowhere does the Constitution mention a separation of church and
          state.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: The literal words
          &quot;separation of church and state&quot; do not appear in the
          Constitution, but the concept is firmly ingrained therein. Thomas
          Jefferson spoke of the First Amendment as creating a &quot;wall of
          separation between church and state.&quot; James Madison wrote that
          the First Amendment created the &quot;total separation of the church
          from the state.&quot; The phrase &quot;religious freedom&quot; appears
          nowhere in the Constitution, yet the document surely grants that
          concept. So it is with separation of church and state.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kennedy said that Thomas
          Jefferson's views on the First Amendment are not important since he
          was in France when the Bill of Rights was drafted.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: The First Amendment was
          clearly influenced by Jefferson's &quot;Statute for Religious
          Liberty,&quot; which he wrote and helped make law in Virginia. James
          Madison, who was Jefferson's protégé, took Jefferson's ideas of
          religious liberty nationwide through the First Amendment. Jefferson's
          ideas were so powerful that he did not need to be in the room during
          the debate over the First Amendment. In fact, Jefferson's ideas and
          beliefs still influence America today, more than 170 years after his
          death.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kennedy said that the U.S.
          Supreme Court applied the doctrine of separation of church and state
          for the first time in 1947.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: This is simply incorrect.
          There were other church-state cases at the high court before 1947. In
          one of them, 1879's <i>Reynolds v. United States</i>, the court spoke
          favorably of Jefferson's &quot;wall of separation&quot; metaphor,
          saying it &quot;may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration
          of the scope and effect of the amendment....&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kennedy interviewed David
          Barton, who stated that Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Danbury (Conn.)
          Baptists, which contains the famous &quot;wall&quot; metaphor, was
          intended only to state Jefferson's belief that the church should be
          protected from the state.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: David Barton is a
          &quot;Christian nation&quot; propagandist whose fallacious view of
          early U.S. history has been definitively debunked by several
          legitimate scholars. The Danbury Baptists wrote to Jefferson because
          they were angry that they still had to pay taxes to support the
          Congregational Church in Connecticut. It is clear from the context of Jefferson's reply that he wrote to agree with their concerns and
          to state his belief that government had no business promoting religion
          or taxing citizens to pay for religion. Jefferson frequently used
          letters to make policy statements, and he told his attorney general
          that he planned to use the response to the Danbury Baptists to make a
          major statement of his views on church-state relations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kennedy insisted that the
          Founding Fathers wanted the Ten Commandments to be the foundation of
          our government.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: If this is what the
          Founders wanted, why isn't it in the Constitution? The Ten
          Commandments tell believers, among other things, not to worship false
          gods, not to make graven images, not to take the Lord's name in vain
          and to keep the Sabbath holy. However, the Constitution includes none
          of these provisions. Instead, the Constitution guarantees religious
          freedom to everyone--Christian and non-Christian--and bars all
          &quot;religious tests&quot; for public office. Claims that the
          Founders based our government on the Ten Commandments are commonly
          heard from Religious Right leaders, but they are based on inaccurate
          history. (For example, many in the Religious Right point to an alleged
          quotation from Madison that says, &quot;We have staked the future of
          all of our political institutions upon the capacity...to control
          ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of
          God.&quot; This quote is false. Madison scholars agree that it is
          completely unsubstantiated by the historical record.) The Founders
          gave us a secular republic, not an officially &quot;Christian
          nation,&quot; as even a casual reading of the Constitution and the
          debate surrounding the Bill of Rights proves.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kennedy asserted that the
          Supreme Court's decisions have removed God from public schools.
          &quot;God was removed and metal detectors were brought in,&quot; he
          said.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RESPONSE: Kennedy is ill-informed
          about the long history of religion in public schools and the conflict
          mandatory prayer and worship sparked in many states. Nor does he seem
          to be aware of the string of state courts that struck down coercive
          school devotions in the 19th century, holding that they were
          incompatible with state constitutions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kennedy seems to believe that public
          schools were better in the 1940s and '50s when mandatory prayer
          existed in many states. Yet graduation rates for those periods were
          dismal, the number of students who went on to college was a fraction
          of what it is today. Furthermore, public education at that time was
          racially segregated in many states. It certainly was no golden age.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* * * * *</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">D. James Kennedy is a Religious
          Right propagandist, not a scholar. While Kennedy holds several
          degrees, they are from seminaries and religious institutions and do
          not qualify him as an expert on U.S. history or constitutional law.
          His analysis should be viewed with extreme skepticism.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also worth noting that Kennedy
          uses attacks on church-state separation to raise money. Three times
          during his Jan. 23 broadcast he appeared on camera to appeal for
          donations. His Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based Coral Ridge Ministries Media
          is a successful fund-raising operation, taking in $28.3 million in
          1997.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kennedy also urged his viewers to
          sign a petition asking the Supreme Court to reverse course on the
          separation of church and state. He did not tell his flock that such
          petition drives are a waste of time, as the high court is required to
          make its decisions on the basis of what the Constitution says, not
          what one group of people may want or even demand. If our civil
          liberties were left up to the whims of mobs, we would have few rights
          indeed.</font></p>
