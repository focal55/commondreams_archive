- June 9 -  The following was

released today by Environmental Defense, National Environmental

Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Union of Concerned

Scientists and World Wildlife Fund:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading science and environmental groups today lauded the

draft of Climate Change and Our Nation, which will be

released for public review on Monday, June 12, as a balanced

assessment of the potential impacts of climate variability and change

on the United States. At the same time, the groups warned that the

country should view the report as a wake-up call for Americans to

take climate change seriously, and to launch significant efforts to

reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to hedge against possible

negative impacts and surprises.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Places that Americans love like Florida's coral reefs and the

alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains could suffer greatly from

global warming, according to the report. America's alarm bells

should go off today," said Jennifer Morgan, director of the

World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Campaign. "The National

Assessment shows that now more than ever the U.S. must act to

protect its national treasures."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft report, which should be released on June 12 for public

comment, reveals that natural ecosystems are the most vulnerable to

the harmful effects of climate change because they have very limited

options to adapt to these changes and because they are already

stressed through air and water pollution, habitat fragmentation, and

overuse.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Major alteration of natural ecosystems due to a changing climate

is particularly significant because our lives and our economy depend

on the sustained bounty of our Nation's lands, waters, and native

plant and animal communities," the report stated.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the key findings of the report are:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- According to the climate models used in the assessments,

temperatures will rise 5-10 degrees F on average in the next

100 years if trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue, but

increases will vary somewhat from one U.S. region to the next.

It is also very likely that more rain will come in heavy downpours,

increasing the risk of floods.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ecosystems are highly vulnerable to the projected rate and

magnitude of climate change. The goods and services lost through the

disappearance or fragmentation of certain ecosystems are likely to
be

costly or impossible to replace.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Throughout the U.S., water is likely to become one of the key

concerns in coming decades: droughts, floods, declining snow packs

and water quality, and possibly greater water use conflicts could

become even more common problems than they are today.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Climate change and the resulting rise in sea level are likely

to worsen threats to buildings, roads, powerlines and other

infrastructure along the coast. Sea-level rise is very likely to

cause the loss of some barrier beaches, islands, and wetlands, and

worsen storm surges and flooding during storms.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Overall, U.S. crop productivity is likely to increase over the

next few decades, but the gains will not be uniform across the

nation. Falling prices and competition are likely to stress some

farmers. And pests, droughts and floods could reduce some of the

benefits from higher temperatures, precipitation and carbon dioxide.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Similarly, forest productivity is likely to increase in some

areas over the next few decades, but fires, insects, droughts and

diseases will possibly decrease productivity. Climate change will

cause long-term shifts in forest species, such as sugar maples moving

north out of the Northeast or economically important soft wood

species moving from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report covers all regions of the country, and assesses the

potential impacts of climate variability and change on water,

agriculture, human health, forests, coastal areas, and marine

resources.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This report brings the meaning of global climate change home to

every American," said Dr. Susanne Moser of the Union of Concerned

Scientists. "Even if the impacts ultimately manifest differently from

what the report projects, everyone will experience some changes, and

everyone should know that climate change is not science fiction. In

some regions, like Alaska, the impacts of warming are here, now."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report consists of an overview and a much longer foundation

document, and is a snapshot of the current state of knowledge

produced through a series of regional and sectoral assessments,

supplemented through the peer-reviewed literature. The report release

was preceded by an extensive, multistage peer-review process

involving more than 300 scientific and technical experts throughout

the country, and overseen by a Blue Ribbon Panel of renowned

scientists.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The so-called National Assessment Synthesis Team, a group of

14 climate change impacts experts, who authored the report,

was convened by the President's Council of Advisors on Science

and Technology. Federal agencies, under the guidance of the

Office of Science and Technology Policy, also reviewed the report.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Climate change is already happening," said Dr. Janine Bloomfield,

senior scientist at Environmental Defense, "Because greenhouse gasses

stay in the earth's atmosphere for decades, the time for action is

now. Reducing emissions is the most important action we can take now

to minimize damage to people, ecosystems, and economies."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report does not cover the current state of climate science,

the question of human causation, or how heat-trapping gases can be

reduced but instead focuses exclusively on the potential impacts of

global warming, given selected climate change scenarios. It

identifies regions and sectors most vulnerable to climate change,

opportunities to adapt to likely changes, and the most critical

information needs for the U.S. to be better positioned to predict

climate change impacts. "No matter how aggressively emissions are

reduced, the world will still experience some climate change," the

report stated. This is because elevated concentrations of greenhouse

gases will remain in the atmosphere for decades as the climate system

responds only slowly to changes in human inputs.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The assessment shows that many of the country's distinct natural

features could deteriorate as a result of changing climate," said Dr.

Susan Subak, a senior research associate at the Natural Resources

Defense Council. "Whether we're talking about fisheries and

recreational areas on the coasts, or the habitats of America's

mountains and deserts, rising temperatures will put further stress
on

our natural areas."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This report is yet another blow to the global warming naysayers.

It confirms the validity of the science and the seriousness of the

impacts on human health, our economy and our environment," said

Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust. "And

it demonstrates that the current international negotiations in Bonn

and the November negotiations in The Hague are critical."
