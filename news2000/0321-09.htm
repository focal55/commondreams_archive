-  March 21 - Calling the situation of  East Timorese refugees in Indonesia "a criminal 
matter," East Timorese Nobel Laureate Jose Ramos-Horta urged their speedy 
return. He said that all but the commanders responsible for ongoing 
military and militia terror are welcome to return. These leaders must be 
called to account, and the international community "must take strong 
measures at all levels to put the Indonesian military in check."

<p>In a statement issued today, Ramos-Horta also praised Indonesian President 
Abdurrahman Wahid's efforts at reconciliation with East Timor and urged the 
international community to support democracy in Indonesia. "By suspending 
all military ties with that brutal military, the ... world will not only 
help stop the terror in West Timor, they will also strengthen the civilian 
government... [and] bring closer the day when the people of Indonesia can 
finally live in peace, free from military repression."

<p>Ramos-Horta called on the international community to push forward with its 
own tribunal, while supporting Indonesia's efforts to investigate and 
prosecute some of those responsible "for the nightmare of destruction East 
Timor has witnessed since 1975." He said, "such a tribunal would guarantee 
justice is served against the masterminds of genocide in the Indonesian 
military high command if Indonesia cannot meet standard international norms 
of due process." He urged the international community to clarify the 
standards that Indonesia must satisfy for credible prosecutions.

<p>Ramos-Horta, vice president of the National Council of Timorese Resistance 
(CNRT), said East Timorese are welcome to return "including those who 
collaborated with Indonesia... The CNRT will accept no reprisals against 
any of them. This is their country."

<p>He urged an intensive short-term increase in personnel in West Timor "to 
help with accompaniment of civilians. International aid workers must be 
sent in to the camps, to shine the light of international attention on what 
our people are
facing on a daily basis."

<p>Jose Ramos-Horta shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.

Statement by<br>
1996 Nobel Peace Prize Co-Laureate<br>
José Ramos-Horta<br><br>

The National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) is deeply concerned 
about the dire situation still facing those East Timorese in militia and 
military-controlled camps in West Timor.<br><br>

More than a month ago, West Timor officials stated that nearly 500 East 
Timorese, including 310 children, have died due to inadequate sanitation 
and medical care in the camps. Sanitation and access to medical treatment 
in the camps is practically nonexistent. Attacks and intimidation by 
militia and military are an ongoing reality. Access by international aid 
groups to the refugees is extremely limited, and there have been many 
militia attacks on aid workers. That this situation continues six months 
after these East Timorese were driven into forced exile is a criminal 
matter that must be remedied immediately.<br><br>

The propaganda being spread through the camps by hard liners in the 
Indonesian military and their militia lackeys about violence in East Timor 
is making repatriation efforts much more difficult. We are committed to 
working together with the Indonesian government to explain to our East 
Timorese brothers and sisters that they can return safely, including those 
who collaborated with Indonesia.<br><br>

Those thousands who voted for autonomy with Indonesia and those militia 
members who collaborated with the Indonesian Army can feel safe returning 
to their homeland. The CNRT will accept no reprisals against any of them. 
This is their country, they belong here and all of us -- the resistance, 
the pro-autonomy groups -- must meet halfway, bury the past, consolidate 
peace and rebuild this country.<br><br>

However, there can be no tolerance for militia leadership that continues to 
oversee terror campaigns in West Timor, or cross-border and against Oecussi 
in East Timor. Those responsible for such premeditated savagery must be 
arrested immediately. Very recently, international peacekeepers near the 
border between East and West Timor came under fire from Indonesian 
military-backed militias four times in 24 hours. More recently, a 
cross-border raid into East Timor by either militias or military (in too 
many cases they are one and the same) killed one East Timorese civilian; a 
UN military spokesman said, "further harassment and killing of innocent 
locals could very well take place."<br><br>

We are relieved that at long last a militia boss in West Timor, Moko 
Soares, was arrested, but we are concerned over the nature of and authority 
over his pending trial in West Timor. More of those in the militia 
leadership that are still ordering attacks must be brought to trial, and 
their bosses in the Indonesian military should be called to account as 
well. If the Indonesian authorities in West Timor can, in the arrogant 
double speak of the Suharto era, say our people in the camps need to decide 
whether or not they will come home by the end of March, certainly the rest 
of the world can tell those authorities that the military thugs calling the 
shots need to decide to cut loose the militias this week.<br><br>

In East Timor we are beginning, with UNTAET, to establish our own judicial 
system, which will soon be ready to try those in East Timor arrested for 
militia or criminal violence.  But, our brothers and sisters will have a 
harder time practicing forgiveness here in East Timor if they know justice 
is not being served at the highest levels of power, through trials of those 
in the Indonesian military who are responsible for the nightmare of 
destruction East Timor has witnessed since 1975. This is also the only way 
to send a signal once and for all that the international community will not 
tolerate ongoing military aggression against innocent East Timorese 
civilians. For this reason, while we support the process of investigation 
and trials underway in Indonesia we also encourage the international 
community to push forward with support for a tribunal. Such a tribunal 
would guarantee justice served against the masterminds of genocide in the 
Indonesian military high command if Indonesia cannot meet standard 
international norms of due process.  The international community should 
clarify these standards now, and focus particular attention on the 
credibility of judicial personnel, witness protection, and military 
cooperation, and it should not allow selective immunity from prosecution.<br><br>

We were extremely grateful that President Wahid took the bold step of 
coming to East Timor and reaching out his hand in reconciliation. This 
gesture of goodwill, in which he acknowledged with regret the destruction 
of our country by the Indonesian military, was not taken lightly by the

East Timorese people. Nor will we forget that President Wahid supported our 
right to self-determination in the Suharto years. We are also grateful for 
his promise that Indonesian military support for the militia in West Timor 
will end, and look forward to seeing it fulfilled.<br><br>

The international community must support the pro-democracy movement and the 
civilian government in Indonesia by taking strong measures at all levels to 
put the Indonesian military in check. By suspending all military ties with 
that brutal military, the great countries of the world not only help stop 
the terror in West Timor, they also strengthen the civilian government of 
our friend Abdurrahman Wahid, and bring closer the day when the people of 
Indonesia can finally live in peace, free from military repression and the 
draconian "dual-function" that maintains it.  We are grateful for current 
restrictions and call for their continuation, until Indonesia is truly 
under civilian control, as well as fulfilling its commitments to legal 
accountability and the return of our people.<br><br>

To help speed the return home of our fellow East Timorese still in West 
Timor, we ask for an intensive short-term increase in personnel to help 
with accompaniment of civilians. International aid workers must be sent 
into the camps, to shine the light of international attention once more on 
what our people are facing on a daily basis.<br><br>

I thank you for your urgent attention to these vital matters.<br><br>
