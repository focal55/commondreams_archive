- January 26 - Four weeks ago, Internet toy giant eToys announced to the press that it 
was "moving away" from its lawsuit against European art group etoy in 
response to the torrent of public outrage. As the weeks went by without 
further action, however, many activists decided that eToys' words had 
represented a typical corporate ploy to derail opposition, and that the 
company had no intention of actually dropping the suit.
<p>
Activists quickly renewed their campaigns against eToys. RTMark 
initiated two new campaigns to drive eToys' stock price yet further 
down (it has now sunk well below its opening value of $20 per share, 
after a high of $67 reached the day the protests began), and a new 
community platform, <a href="http://www.toywar.com" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://www.toywar.com</a>, gathered a "toy army" of 
1400 activists poised to perform "operations" on command.
<p>
The strongest attack to date was scheduled to coincide with eToys' 
earnings announcement on Thursday. Today, just in time, eToys 
formally dropped its case against etoy "without prejudice"--a phrase 
that means either party is still free to attack the other. eToys has 
also formally agreed to pay etoy's court costs and other expenses 
incurred as a result of the lawsuit.
<p>
"A precedent has now finally been set in stone," said RTMark 
spokesperson Ray Thomas. "eToys thought it could act like corporations 
typically do, but it had no idea how the Internet works. Now e-commerce 
corporations have a choice: either obtain a legal stranglehold on the 
Internet, so that this kind of defensive reaction is no longer possible, 
or behave decently towards the humans who use this medium for purposes 
other than profit."
<p>
"This is the Brent Spar of e-commerce," said Reinhold Grether, an 
Internet researcher and a mastermind of the anti-eToys campaigns. "Just 
as the petroleum industry learned it had to listen to environmentalists, 
so e-commerce companies have now learned that the Internet doesn't 
belong to them, and they can't do whatever they want with it." (See 
<a href="http://rtmark.com/shell" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://rtmark.com/shell</a> for more about the Brent Spar, and 
<a href="http://www.hygrid.de/etoyrhiz.html" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://www.hygrid.de/etoyrhiz.html</a> for more comments by Grether.)
<p>
"eToys will try to paint this as a misunderstanding, as just a simple 
error that has now been corrected," wrote etoy in a prepared statement. 
"But this is not what happened. They tried to destroy us, and that got 
them into very big trouble. They wanted to drop their case 'with 
prejudice,' because they fear further attacks and trademark battles, 
but now they see they have no choice at all in the matter. It is a 
total victory."
<p>
WHAT NOW?
<p>
Even though etoy has recovered its domain, the etoy Fund will not be 
retired, said RTMark spokesperson Thomas. Each project's discussion 
board will continue to function, and the resources of the etoy Fund 
pages will continue to be accessible for use and research.
<p>
"We hope that this campaign continues to serve as a reminder to people 
of what corporations do when left to their own devices, and as a 
reminder to corporations of what they cannot do, at least on the 
Internet," said Thomas. "We also hope people continue expressing their 
anger at eToys, if they so choose. There are many ways to embarrass and 
further damage this company--the Nazi figurine eToys advertises could lead 
to a boycott by Jewish groups, for example."
<p>
Another immediate option would be a class-action lawsuit by eToys 
investors, said lawyer and RTMark member Rita Mae Rakoczi. "It could 
convincingly be argued that eToys, being an Internet company, should 
have known what it was getting into, and has seriously mismanaged its 
stockholders' money. If etoy's possession of etoy.com is so dangerous--
as perhaps it really is--why didn't eToys choose a different name for 
the company when they had the chance? And why did they choose to pursue 
in an openly hostile manner an art group best known for a piece called 
the 'Digital Hijack,' which made sophisticated use of technology to 
playfully attack users' browsers? It wouldn't take an Einstein to 
predict trouble."
<p>
"If eToys stumbled into this through sheer stupidity and negligence," 
Rakoczi continued, "it could be liable to investors for part of the $4 
billion in value that's been lost as a consequence. A successful 
lawsuit could even entail eToys losing its own trademark, which would 
likely mean the end of the company." RTMark has set up a page 
containing links to resources on class action lawsuits against 
corporate managements (http://rtmark.com/etoysclassaction.html).
<p>
"Things on the Internet don't go away," said etoy in its statement. 
"'Brick and mortar' corporations do this sort of thing and then bury 
it--but this will always be there when you search for information on 
eToys. It will always be very visible what bastards they were. They can 
never recover from this." The 1400 "Toywar soldiers" mustered by 
<a href="http://www.toywar.com" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://www.toywar.com</a> will remain on high alert, according to the 
platform's operators, and are prepared to spring into action at the 
slightest indication of further aggression by eToys.
<p>
"And Network Solutions had better be careful, too," etoy said. "We will 
not tolerate any delay in the reinstallation of the etoy.com DNS 
entries." Network Solutions, the company in charge of Internet domains, 
illegally terminated etoy's e-mail shortly after the November 29 
injunction, although no such move was required by the order. (See 
http://rtmark.com/etoyvaticano.html for another example of illegal 
behavior by Network Solutions.)
<p>
BACKGROUND AND TIMELINE (see also http://rtmark.com/etoyline.html)
<p>
Late last year, eToys attempted to buy etoy.com from European art group 
etoy, and offered upwards of $500,000 in cash and stock options for 
the domain. etoy turned down the offer, so on November 29, 1999, eToys 
obtained a court injunction preventing etoy from operating a website at
www.etoy.com, which had been registered before eToys even existed. To 
obtain the injunction eToys told the judge that etoy.com was confusing 
customers, and furthermore that it contained pornography and calls to 
violence. etoy.com had never made any reference to eToys or toys, nor 
featured anything resembling pornography or calls to violence.
<p>
During the subsequent weeks, activists attacked eToys by a variety of 
means that have been widely credited with contributing to the 70% 
decline in the value of eToys stock--a decline that began the same day 
as the protests.
<p>
The Dec. 15-25 Virtual Sit-in crippled the eToys servers, as <a href="http://cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/9912/17/mlld.00.html" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">CNN 
reported</a>, and 
prompted eToys to file a restraining order against one of the 
organizations responsible for it, and to threaten another activist 
anonymously.
<p>
Simultaneously, the Disinvest! campaign filled eToys investment boards 
and other outlets with messages about the situation. Many investors 
responded by dumping their eToys stock. Even those who refused to see 
a link between activist attacks and the eToys stock fall were at a loss 
to explain how it could lose so much money, so consistently, on 
consistently good financial news. Some suspected foul play by eToys 
management, and the possibility of a class-action lawsuit was raised.
<p>
Finally, on December 29, eToys announced it was "moving away" from its 
lawsuit in response to public outrage. At first, etoy and the activists 
were delighted, and a formal counterpart to the statement was expected 
from hour to hour. Then, when nothing happened for days and then weeks, 
it became clear that eToys' announcement had been an empty verbal 
concession it had no intention of making concrete--a typical corporate 
ploy to derail activist momentum.
<p>
Activists quickly renewed their campaign to damage eToys. Perhaps 
startled by the endurance of its opponents, and nervous about further 
attacks and proof of instability during the week it is to announce its 
quarterly earnings, eToys today--at 15:20 Pacific Standard Time, to be
exact--finally backed down on paper, ceding full rights to etoy.com on
etoy's terms, without precondition and with payment of court costs and 
other expenses.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
RTMark, which is in no way associated with etoy, aims to publicize the 
widespread corporate abuse of democratic institutions like courts and 
elections. To this end it solicits and distributes funding for 
"sabotage projects." Groups of such projects are called "mutual funds" 
in order to call attention to one way in which large numbers of people 
come to identify corporate needs as their own. RTMark projects do not 
normally target specific companies; the etoy Fund projects are an 
exception.
