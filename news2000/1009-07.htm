- October 9 - "Since 29 September, Israeli security forces have frequently
used excessive force on demonstrators when lives were not in
immediate danger," Amnesty International said today.

<p>In  preliminary conclusions from Amnesty International's
delegation in Israel and the Occupied Territories the human
rights organization reiterated its condemnation of the excessive
use of force by law enforcement officials.

<p>"In many cases the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the
Israel Police and the Border Police have apparently breached
their own internal regulations on the use of force, as well as
international human rights standards on the use of force and
firearms," Amnesty International said.

<p>More than 80 people, including children, nearly all of
them Palestinians from the Occupied Territories and Israel, have
died since clashes began on 29 September 2000 between Israeli
security forces and Palestinian demonstrators all over the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as in Israel. There have also
been armed confrontations between the Israeli and Palestinian
security forces.

<p>An Amnesty International delegation is currently in
Israel and the Occupied Territories, including the areas under
the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, to examine
policing of demonstrations in view of the loss of life. The
delegation is composed of  Dr. Stephen Males, a former senior
Police officer of the UK police with special expertise in
sensitive public order policing, and Dr Elizabeth Hodgkin, a
researcher from the International Secretariat of Amnesty
International.

<p>The delegates have met NGOs, doctors and over 50
witnesses to the events. They have visited to sites in Ramallah,
Nablus, East Jerusalem, Nazareth, Arabah and other parts of
northern Israel, places where demonstrators have died after the
Israeli security forces fired on demonstrators and rioters. The
delegates have seen large quantities of expended and some live
ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets, CS grenades and
projectiles, during visits to sites of demonstrations, as well as
bullets embedded in surrounding homes and much bullet damage.
<p>Amnesty International has compiled the following
preliminary conclusions:

<p>- In many cases security forces apparently used firearms when
their lives and the lives of others were not in imminent danger.
However, according to internationally adopted principles, law
enforcement officials shall only use firearms, if other means
remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the
intended result. Firearms may be used against people, after
appropriate warnings are given, only to prevent death or serious
injury where less extreme  means are insufficient to achieve
these objectives. The standards underscore that law enforcement
officials may resort to the intentional lethal use of firearms
only when strictly unavoidable to protect life.

<p>- In some instances, Israeli security forces impeded wounded
persons from receiving access to medical assistance. Security
forces also reportedly fired on people helping to remove the
wounded, in two cases killing ambulance men. The International
Committee of the Red Cross has publicly appealed to all parties
to protect and assist the injured and all medical personnel in
their vital life-saving operations.

<p>- In instances where the security forces have not been deployed
against demonstrators, riots have generally not evolved and
crowds have dispersed. For example, after two days in which two
Palestinians were killed in demonstrations in Um al-Fahm in
Israel on 1 and 2 October, on 3 October security forces did not
arrive to police a demonstration and demonstrators dispersed
peacefully.

<p>Two Palestinian refugees were also reported killed in
south Lebanon on 7 October when Israeli troops opened fire across
the Lebanese-Israeli border on demonstrators protesting against
Israel.

<p>On 7 October, three Israeli soldiers were captured at
about noon by the Lebanese armed group Hizbullah. Amnesty
International calls on Hizbullah to accord the three soldiers
prisoner of war status and to allow them immediate access to the
International Committee of the Red Cross.  Amnesty International
notes that Hizbullah has publicly stated its intention to use the
three Israeli soldiers to secure the release of Lebanese and
other Arab prisoners held in Israel.

<p>Amnesty International reminds Hizbullah that
hostage-taking is prohibited by international law and is
inconsistent with fundamental principles of international
humanitarian law. Amnesty International has long called for the
release of Lebanese detainees held in Israel as hostages,
including Shaykh 'Abd al-Karim al-'Ubayd and Mustafa al-Dirani.

<p>A national commission established by the Israeli
government will investigate killings which occurred in Israel.
However, it is important that all killings are investigated which
occurred in circumstances suggesting that they violated
international law and standards. Investigations should be
conducted by an independent and impartial body and by one which,
in the current highly-charged political atmosphere, is perceived
as such.

<p>Amnesty International is therefore calling on the United
Nations to establish urgently an independent international
investigation, to include criminal justice experts known for
their impartiality and integrity, to investigate all killings of
civilians that took place since 29 September in Israel, the
Occupied Territories and south Lebanon.

<p>"To ensure independence and impartiality of the
international investigation, its members should exclude persons
whose background could appear to lack impartiality," Amnesty
International said.

<p>"The investigation should be properly resourced and
include ballistic, forensic or other technical experts that may
be required. It should report to the Commission on Human Rights,
the General Assembly and the Security Council, and the
authorities concerned should be obliged to cooperate fully with
the investigation."
