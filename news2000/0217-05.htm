- February 17 - Citing compelling

     evidence that top McCain campaign advisor Richard Quinn has

     espoused and promoted deeply troubling, racially insensitive views

     for at least two decades, People For the American Way today called

     on Sen. John McCain both to publicly disavow Quinn's views and to

     terminate Quinn's involvement with his presidential campaign.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter delivered this morning to McCain's Senate office and

      campaign headquarters, PFAW President Ralph G. Neas detailed

      concerns about a variety of troubling writings both by Quinn and by

      others published in the magazine Southern Partisan, where Quinn has

      exercised significant editorial control as executive editor and editor-in-chief since 1981.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAW undertook a search of PFAW Foundation's archives and of the

      Internet after several news reports raised alarming questions about

      Quinn's views and those espoused by the magazine he edits. Among

      the material PFAW uncovered are columns written by Quinn attacking

      Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela, discounting the evils

      of slavery, and commending those who voted for former Ku Klux Klan

      leader David Duke.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas also sent McCain copies of two stories that the letter

      describes as "material of a most offensive and divisive nature."

      The stories, which portray enslaved Africans or ex-slaves as crude

      stereotypes are "insulting and disrespectful of African-Americans'

      struggle for equality," the letter says.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A President must be President to all the people," Neas wrote.

      "To tie your campaign for the highest office in the land to such

      views would give them a legitimacy that is very troubling."
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While you are to be commended for your criticism of George W.

      Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University," Neas continued, "you

      would do well to be sure that your own house is in order."
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following is the full text of the letter from PFAW President

      Ralph G. Neas. Materials referred to in the letter are available by

      fax on request.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO SENATOR JOHN McCAIN,
<br>
      FEBRUARY 17, 2000
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator McCain:
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am writing to express deep concern over information that has

      come to light over the past ten days regarding one of your top

      campaign advisors, Richard M. Quinn.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York Times, Newsday, and The New Republic have raised

      serious questions about deeply disturbing views expressed by Mr.

      Quinn and others in the Southern Partisan, a magazine over which

      Mr. Quinn has presided as Executive Editor or Editor-in-Chief since

      1981. As you may know, People For the American Way Foundation

      maintains one of the nation's most extensive archives on extremist

      groups. We have used these resources and those available on the

      Internet to follow up on those troubling news reports.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The material we found in the past 48 hours is, if anything, even

      more appalling than that reported by the news media. Mr. Quinn

      used his editorial platform at the Southern Partisan to personally

      espouse views that place him far outside the political mainstream.

      He has repeatedly used his column to attack heroes of the struggle

      for equality including Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela.

      At the same time, he has discounted the evils of slavery by

      suggesting that it was not as bad as it has been portrayed and that

      slaves were better off in slavery than out of it. (Copies of all

      articles referenced in this letter and other similar ones are

      attached.)
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As recently as 1996, a Southern Partisan reviewer wrote of a

      book on slavery, "The greatest contribution of this work is that it

      exonerates slave owners by stating that they did not have a

      practice of breaking up slave families. If anything, they

      encouraged strong slave families to further the slaves' peace and

      happiness in order to promote efficient work."
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1983, in a column arguing against the recognition of Martin

      Luther King Day, Mr. Quinn wrote:
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- "King Day should have been rejected because its purpose is

      vitriolic and profane."
<br>
      -- "The black leaders who lobbied so furiously for King Day

      confirmed another unpleasant reality. By celebrating King as the

      incarnation of all they admire, they have chosen to glorify the

      histrionic rather than the heroic and by inference they spurned the

      brightest and the best among their own race."
<br>
      -- "Ignoring the real heroes in our nation's life, the blacks

      have chosen a man who represents not their emancipation, not their

      sacrifices and bravery in service to their country; rather, they

      have chosen a man whose role in history was to lead his people into

      a perpetual dependence on the welfare state, a terrible bondage of

      body and soul."
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1990, the world hailed Nelson Mandela as a hero, but Mr.

      Quinn went on the attack. He wrote:
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- "After all, Mr. Mandela was put in jail 27 years ago -- not

      because of his humanitarian philosophy -- but because he was a

      terrorist who openly advocated (and personally committed) violence

      against the government."
<br>
      -- "How many people out there across the face of America are

      well aware that Mandela is a bad egg, maybe even say so in the

      comfort and security of their homes, but are afraid to express

      their real opinions publicly?"
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The year before he attacked Mandela in print, Mr. Quinn wrote an

      article about former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's bid for

      public office. Although he made a point of claiming that his

      article should not be construed as a defense of Duke, his own words

      supporting those who voted for Duke don't square with that

      disclaimer. He wrote:
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- "What better way to reject politics as usual than to elect a

      maverick like David Duke? What better way to tweak the nose of the

      establishment?"
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even more jarring than Quinn's soft words for David Duke is the

      harsh attitude conveyed toward another Republican: Abraham Lincoln.

      The Southern Partisan's merchandising operation, the "Southern

      Partisan General Store" includes a T-shirt bearing Lincoln's

      likeness and the legend "Sic Semper Tyrannis," the phrase shouted

      by John Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln. Among the materials

      attached to this letter is a December 1995 form letter on Southern

      Partisan letterhead, listing Quinn as Editor-in-Chief, apologizing

      that the "anti-Lincoln T-shirt" has sold out in all but odd sizes.

      The letter offers, "If the enclosed shirt will not suffice, we will

      be glad to refund your money or immediately ship you another

      equally militant shirt from our catalog."
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other offensive and divisive materials have appeared in the

      Southern Partisan throughout Mr. Quinn's tenure. Although other

      writers' bylines appear on some of these materials, as Executive

      Editor and then as Editor-in-Chief Mr. Quinn certainly bears

      responsibility for the editorial content of the magazine. Among

      the most offensive materials in this category are two stories from

      1989, which I've enclosed. One, entitled "Popo," tells a story

      about an enslaved African who saved his master from being lynched

      by northern soldiers by dancing. A second story in a similar vein

      tells about a female ex-slave, "Old Aunt Mary." Senator McCain, I

      rarely use the word "racist" - but there is no other word

      appropriate for stories as insulting and disrespectful of African

      Americans' struggle for equality as these stories are.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I do not -- and would not -- suggest that Mr. Quinn does not

      have the right to hold such views. If the First Amendment means

      anything, it means that each person has a right to his own views,

      no matter how offensive or extreme.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it does our country -- and the Republican Party -- a great

      disservice to lend credibility to such views by placing their

      proponent in a position of such high authority. A President must

      be President to all the people. To tie your campaign for the

      highest office in the land to such views would give them a

      legitimacy that is very troubling.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While you are to be commended for your criticism of George W.

      Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University, you would do well to be

      sure that your own house is in order. Therefore, I urge you to

      immediately repudiate the views of race expressed by Mr. Quinn in

      his own writings and in the magazine he heads and to terminate his

      involvement in your campaign.
</font>
     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,
