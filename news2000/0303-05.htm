- March 3 - The following was

released today by Handgun Control Inc.:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent shootings in Michigan and Pennsylvania have again

thrust the issue of gun safety into the national spotlight --

much to the dismay of the National Rifle Association and the

pro-gun presidential candidates, who are now being forced to

deal with a problem which they don't want to talk about.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, the NRA, Gov. George Bush and Sen. John McCain

are in full "spin cycle," using smoke-and-mirrors public relations
to

claim to be championing gun safety legislation to deflect their poor

records on the issue of gun safety. At the same time, what the NRA

and these pro-gun candidates say and do on the issue of gun control

are two completely different things entirely.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to the heavy media coverage of the shootings in

Michigan and Pennsylvania, the NRA has toned down its typical

anti-gun control rhetoric and has now expressed its alleged support

for reasonable gun control laws designed to keep firearms out of the

hands of children. Ironically, the NRA's new public relations

campaign follows eight months of aggressive lobbying Congress to

defeat the package of common-sense gun control amendments to the

juvenile justice bill, including proposals closing the gun show

loophole, requiring mandatory safety locks for all new guns sold, and

banning the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons for

juveniles under age 18.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the "new" NRA and recent gun control converts George W.

Bush and John McCain have belatedly come out in support of stronger

gun control laws to help protect children, they've got a short memory

about their long-standing positions on the proposals they are now

claiming to support.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same NRA that now proclaims that they "support and encourage

the distribution of safety locks," last year opposed a Senate floor

amendment that simply would have required the sale of a safety lock

with every handgun sold by a licensed dealer. Believe it, or not,

only a few months ago NRA top lobbyist James J. Baker called the

defeat of the safety lock amendment, "a great victory for public

safety." In arguing against this common-sense proposal, the NRA uses

its familiar scare tactics to convince gun owners that these laws

will lead to house-by-house inspections.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This irresponsible and dishonest talk mirrors the misinformed talk

of the "trigger lock police" from Governor George W. Bush in last

night's Republican presidential debate. While our children continue

to be killed by guns that are improperly stored, both the Texas

Governor and the NRA continue to use a message of fear to scare the

public into believing that these laws are enforced on the gun owner

rather than on the gun manufacturer, which is the intent of the

proposal.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, while it now claims to want to do more to protect children

from firearms, the NRA has consistently dismissed, and even actively

lobbied against, efforts to make guns "childproof," or "smart guns"

that cannot be fired by unauthorized users. To underscore its

opposition to this innovative safety proposal, it recently launched
a

radio ad campaign in Washington, D.C. and several other media markets

mocking President Clinton's call to provide funding to expand

research and development efforts for "smart gun" technologies. The

ad, which features a President Clinton impersonator, parodies the

television show "Get Smart," with a fake agent saying the "smart gun"

proposal "doesn't sound very smart to me."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just this morning on the Today Show, NRA Executive Vice President

Wayne LaPierre said that, "if you have young children in the house,

you better lock up your guns and you better make them inaccessible.

And if you're criminally negligent, you should be charged and we

support that."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe Wayne ought to inform his lobbyists in Washington about

the NRA's "new" position. For many years, the NRA has fought

laws to hold adults criminally responsible for improperly storing

of firearms so that they are not accessible to children, called

Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws. Right now in Ohio, in fact,

the NRA is fighting a CAP bill that would make it a crime for

an adult to leave a loaded firearm where it is accessible by

children, even going as far as calling the legislation the

"(Governor) Taft Burglar Protection Act."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their efforts haven't been limited to Ohio. The NRA has

lobbied against CAP legislation across the country. Just this

year, they have fought it in New Hampshire. They have fought

CAP in Rhode Island, Washington and Indiana too. Here again,

the powerful gun lobby uses dishonest rhetoric to imply that

these laws would require people to lock up their guns all of

time, even if there were no children in the house, and would also

make families vulnerable to crime. A 1997 study published in the

Journal of American Medical Association found that state safe storage

laws are particularly effective at reducing gun injuries and deaths

among children.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRA came to the Today Show to promote its message of

enforcement over stronger laws and express its newfound interest in

the safety of our children, but it failed to mention that, in its

zeal to defeat all new gun control laws, no matter how reasonable,

they have helped to make it easier for children and criminals to get

guns. In December, the NRA led the fight in Illinois to reduce the

penalty for illegally carrying a gun from a felony to a misdemeanor,

and recently defeated a proposal in Utah that would have strengthened

penalties for violent gun misdemeanants. Last April in Missouri, the

NRA spent more than $4 million in an unsuccessful attempt to pass a

referendum that would have allowed people convicted of violent

misdemeanors, including stalking and child molestation, to carry a

hidden handgun almost anywhere in the state.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Talk is cheap. After each horrible shooting in America, the NRA

talks about its support for laws making it more difficult for

children and criminals to get guns. Then they fight them when

lawmakers try to pass these laws.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When John McCain talks about his support for new gun safety laws,

he doesn't mention that he voted against the Brady bill, the assault

weapons ban, mandatory background checks for all sales at gun shows,

even legislation banning the manufacture, sale and importation of

undetectable plastic guns. When George W. Bush talks about

protecting children from guns, he doesn't want to tell people that
he

opposed closing the gun show loophole in his state that still allow

children and criminals to easily access guns, and signed into law one

of the nation's most lax concealed-carry laws that allow permit

holders to carry hidden handguns into most public places, even

churches and amusement parks in Texas. Governor Bush also won't tell

you how, in June 1999, he signed into law a bill that preempts Texas

cities and counties from suing the gun industry to recover damages.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until the "Johnny-come-lately's" on gun control -- NRA, Governor

Bush and Senator McCain -- put their money where their mouths are,

the American people can expect nothing less than business-as-usual

from our pro-gun "friends."
</font>

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's largest

citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington,

D.C., HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun

control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in

1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works

with local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable

gun control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated

organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be
