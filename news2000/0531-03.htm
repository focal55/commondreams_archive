- May 31 - While the Sierra Club is never opposed to good manners, Texas
     Governor George W. Bush's solution to curbing pollution -- `Just Say
     Please' -- just doesn't work.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
     To shine a spotlight on the Bush failure of Bush's "Just Say Please"
     policy, the Sierra Club launched a new radio ad in Nevada today,
     coinciding with a visit in which the Governor is expected to wrap
     himself in the green flag.
</font>
<p>
     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"George Bush's `just say please' approach has been a failure for
     Texas," said Ellen Pillard, Chair of the Toiyabe Chapter of the Sierra
     Club.  "Gov. Bush hasn't listened when Texans asked him to clean the
     air and water, but we hope he'll be more receptive to Nevadans during
     his visit.  That's why the Sierra Club is urging Nevadans to call
     Governor Bush and tell him to oppose legislation in Congress that
     weakens penalties for clean air and water violators."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
     Despite Bush's attempts to get business to voluntarily reduce
     emissions, Texas has continued to lead the nation in industrial air
     emissions, which increased in the U.S. Environmental Protection
     Agency's most recent Toxic Release Inventory. The state's toxic
     pollution discharged into surface waters jumped nearly 20 percent, to
     approximately 25 million pounds.  And for the first time in history,
     Houston topped Los Angeles as the nation's smog capital in 1999.
</font>
<p>
     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Bush has shown more concern with giving polluters options
     than with protecting families who breathe the nation's dirtiest air,"
     Pillard said.
</font>
<p>
     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Just Say Please," is the latest ad in the Sierra Club's campaign to
     educate voters about George W. Bush's environmental record.  With over
     600,000 members, the Sierra Club is the nation's oldest and largest
     grassroots environmental organization.  It first ran ads about
     Governor Bush's record in November in New Hampshire and has since
     aired ads in six other states.

     * "Bush let industry write an anti-pollution measure, and believes
     voluntary plans, not regulation, can clean up the air and water.  No
     wonder Texas has a world-class pollution problem."

     SCRIPT
     Problem is, that hasn't worked in Texas. For the last four years,
     George Bush has been asking power plants to voluntarily clean up their
     act.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
     DOCUMENTATION
     * Rather than adopting tough laws to reduce pollution from aging
     facilities, Bush asked industry to draft their own regulations to
     pre-empt legislative action.  After a briefing by the industry
     insiders who wrote the plan, DuPont official Jim Kennedy noted the
     voluntary industry proposal, had "no `meat' with respect to actual
     emissions reductions.  One of the [business] leaders actually stated
     that emissions reductions was not a primary driver for the program."

     Today, Environmental Protection Agency's latest data shows Texas leads
     the nation in industrial toxic air pollution and Houston has surpassed
     Los Angeles as America's smoggiest city.

     * The emission of toxic air pollutants emissions rose from 108 million
     pounds in 1997 to approximately 110 million pounds in 1998.  Keeping
     Texas at No. 1 in this category.
     -1998 TRI, Environmental Protection Agency, released May 11, 2000
     * In 1999 this pollution led to Houston passing Los Angeles to claim
     the dubious title as the nation's smoggiest city.  And it's not just
     the number of days-- it's also the intensity.  On Houston's smoggiest
     day, the air was nearly 50 percent dirtier than the air on Los
     Angeles' smoggiest day.

     Truth is, the air and water are cleaner in many places only because of
     tough laws like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.  But George Bush
     has worked to weaken water quality standards for Texas' lakes and

     DOCUMENTATION
     * "More than a third of Texas' industrial air pollution comes from
     so-called grandfathered power plants and other facilities exempt from
     state controls since 1971. Mr. Bush has resisted efforts to force
     cutbacks on these facilities. But more than two years ago, he won
     commitments from dozens of companies to curb pollution
     voluntarily...So far, little of the promised improvement has
     materialized. In 28 months, grandfathered emissions have dropped only
     about 2.4 percent, state records show."

     DOCUMENTATION
     * There is currently legislation in Congress, S. 1053 and H.R. 3507,
     which threaten clean air and clean water.
     * H.R. 3507 is sponsored by Rep. Steve LaTourette R-OH.  It would
     delay and weaken Clean Water Act enforcement against municipal waste
     treatment facilities that. allow the discharge of raw sewage into
     rivers and lakes.  This bill would create an incentive for communities
     to ignore their sanitary sewer overflow problems.  These overflows
     threaten human health and the environment.
     * S. 1053 is sponsored by Sens. Kit Bond R-MO, Gramm R-TX, Hutchinson
     R-TX.  This bill would weaken the sanctions provisions of the Clean
     Air Act of 1990 (signed into law by President George Bush).  Under
     existing law, communities suffering from unhealthful levels of air
     pollution cannot receive federal highways funds for new  highway
     construction that would add to congestion, sprawl and smog until they
     had taken steps to reduce existing levels of air pollution, and
     account for the increase of new pollution caused by the new highways.
     (Federal funding for highway safety measures are exempt from this
     sanction.)  If this sanction is lifted, it would remove incentives for
     cities to adopt clean air plans, and encourage them to build highways
     that make problems worse.
     * Last year, Texas state officials lobbied the Texas Congressional
     delegation to support this bill.
