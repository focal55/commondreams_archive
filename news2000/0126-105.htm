- January 26 - After spending $30
million in 1999 on ads intended to undermine support for an outpatient prescription drug
benefit for Medicare recipients, two spokesman for the prescription drug industry's main
trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), recently
told <i>The New York Times</i> that they would accept legislation to provide Medicare drug
benefits this year (&quot;Drug Makers Drop Their Opposition to Medicare Plan,&quot; Jan.
14).
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just five days after the article
was published, on Jan. 19, PhRMA&#146;s &quot;Public Affairs Section&quot; held a strategy
meeting with industry allies to detail plans that appear designed to undermine support for
a Medicare prescription drug bill. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It&#146;s clear that the
pharmaceutical industry is talking out of both sides of its mouth and is prepared to spend
tens of millions of dollars to ensure that elderly citizens continue to get gouged at the
drug store so that wealthy pharmaceutical executives can keep raking in outrageous
profits,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PhRMA's battle plan includes a calendar of
events for January and February, as well as other documents, revealing that the
industry&#146;s strategy is to work in a highly coordinated way with allied organizations
and front groups. The activities include releasing reports, conducting a major grassroots
public relations and lobbying campaign, initiating state media tours to challenge
increased publicity about how much cheaper drugs are in Canada, and opposing the
&quot;Allen&quot; bill (H.R. 664/S. 731), which is the most popular Medicare prescription
drug bill pending in Congress. Specifically, PhRMA and its allies will: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Undertake a Major Grassroots Public Relations and Lobbying Campaig</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In mid-January PhRMA was to begin running ads on television. And Citizens for
    Better Medicare (CBM), a front group formed and funded largely if not exclusively by PhRMA
    to lobby on the prescription drug issue, also was to begin running ads again after letting
    up at the end of last year. (Trade publications previously reported that up to $35 million
    in additional ads were to run in 2000.) Moreover, a major direct mail and phone bank
    operations were to begin, polls were to be released and extensive lobbying of Capitol Hill
    was to occur</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conduct State Media Tours to Challenge Lower Canadian Drug Prices</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To counter the growing wave of Americans traveling across the border into
    Canada to buy the same drugs at a 25 percent to 50 percent discount from the prices they
    pay in the United States, PhRMA planned to begin state media tours in key border states in
    late January. Targeted states were Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,
    Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. In early February, state media tours on &quot;price
    controls&quot; are also planned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intensify Opposition to the Allen Bill</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act (H.R. 664/S. 731), sponsored by
    Reps. Tom Allen (D-Maine) and Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) in the House and Sens. Tim Johnson
    (D-S.D.) and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) in the Senate, is the most popular Medicare
    prescription drug bill in Congress with 138 House co-sponsors and 12 Senate co-sponsors as
    of Jan. 24, 2000. The Allen bill would allow 39 million Medicare beneficiaries to buy
    prescription drugs at up to 40 percent off current retail prices. A June 1999 Merrill
    Lynch report found that, at most, the impact of the legislation would be to cut drug
    company revenues by 3.3 percent &#151; a modest cut given the enormous profits generated
    by the industry. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Release reports by allies and front groups to bolster the industry&#146;s
    position</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As revealed by the trade association&#146;s calendar of events, the reach of
    PhRMA is substantial when it comes to working with some of Washington&#146;s most
    well-funded conservative think tanks and lobbying organizations, many of whom receive
    substantial financial support from PhRMA and allied corporate patrons. Here is a list of
    scheduled activities on the PhRMA calendar. (An asterisk * indicates membership in
    Citizens for Better Medicare): </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan. 10 &#151; &quot;Goldberg study: Canada access; HIAA [Health Insurance Association

    Goldberg, whose Jan. 17 communication with PhRMA seeking financial support is discussed

    Feb. 27 - &quot;HIMA [Health Industry Manufacturers Association] Studies: Value of Tech;

    Feb. 28 - &quot;Tozzi Study.&quot; This reference appears to be Jim Tozzi, who was listed
    as a lobbyist for the Health Benefits Coalition in 1998, the most recent year for which
    online records are available on the Center for Responsive Politics&#146; Web site.
    According to its mission statement, the HBC was &quot;formed out of concern that federal
    health care mandates proposed in Congress under the guise of &#145;patient
    protections&#146; would increase health care costs .&#133;&quot; Tozzi, a former senior
    official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the Reagan and Carter
    administrations, previously has worked to discredit the risk of second hand smoke on
    behalf of Phillip Morris and its allies. </font></p>
<font FACE="Times New">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, two communications contained in the PhRMA meeting
    documents shed some light on how PhRMA sponsors, or considers sponsoring, supposedly
    objective researchers and commentators:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan. 7, 2000 &#151; Betsey McCaughey Ross, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote
    a letter to Alan Holmer, PhRMA president and CEO, in advance of a scheduled meeting
    &quot;asking PhRMA to support my work at the Hudson Institute, because my writings on
    health care policy can make a substantial difference in public opinion and in the
    nation&#146;s capitol. My track record proves it.&quot; McCaughey is the former Lieutenant
    Governor of New York State under Governor George Pataki. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan. 17, 2000 &#151; Dr. Robert Goldberg, senior research fellow at the Ethics and
    Public Policy Center, sent a memorandum to Alixe Mattingly, PhRMA&#146;s senior vice
    president for public affairs, noting that &quot;last year I put out a steady stream of
    articles (see attached samples), did dozens of radio interviews and participated in a
    number of live and televised forums on the issue of prescription drug
    coverage...Ironically I have been so busy that I have not had time to reach out to the
    right people for such additional funding. So now I am asking your help to help me contact
    the appropriate individuals in various companies to support my research and writing.&quot;
