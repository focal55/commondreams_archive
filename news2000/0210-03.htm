<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  
- February 10 - Human Rights Watch today accused the
Democratic Republic of Congo of violating its promise to the United
Nations not to carry out the death penalty on convicted criminals.
Nineteen people have been executed since January 28, and another
sixty-one people on death row face imminent execution.

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a letter to Congo President Laurent Kabila, Human Rights Watch urged
him to abide by his own government's pledges and immediately suspend any
further executions ordered by the Court of Military Order.

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"These kinds of wholesale executions should not go forward under any
circumstances," said Peter Takirambudde, the Director for Africa at
Human Rights Watch, "but they should certainly not go forward in light
of President Kabila's repeated promises to suspend the death penalty."

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND REPORT ON THE COURT OF MILITARY ORDER IN THE DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Court of Military Order was established in 1997 by presidential
decree law No. 019 shortly after President Laurent Kabila's government
seized power in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Court
initially had a narrow mandate of restoring military discipline in the
capital Kinshasa and its area at a time when criminality and dissent
were on the rise in the army. Following the outbreak of war against the
rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy and its foreign backers in August
1998, the Congolese government expanded both the geographic coverage and
legal mandate of the court with the addition of new chambers at Katanga,
Kasai, and Bas Congo regions, and the establishment of roving courts.
The jurisdiction of the Military Court was further expanded on January
2, 1999 by Decree Law 171, which declared a state of emergency in
regions then controlled by the rebels and their foreign backers. While
the decree law has drawn little international attention, it granted the
military sweeping powers over civilian administration by giving the
military the authority to replace civilian authorities, appropriate
private property, and to forcibly recruit civilians for the "benefit,
directly or indirectly, of national defense and the safeguarding of
public security and interest."


 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The president appoints the judges of the Court of Military Order, and
their decisions could only be reversed by him as the supreme holder of
executive, legislative, and judicial powers in the country. In
contravention of international law, Decree Law 019 establishing the
court does not provide for appeal to a higher jurisdiction. However, the
decree leaves the door open for pleas for presidential pardon in the
case of death sentences. Despite this, many executions were carried out
the same day as sentencing or shortly after, raising doubts as to
whether requests for presidential pardon have been given due
consideration. Since the clemency procedure is secret, it is difficult
to know in how many cases pardon was actually requested and denied.
President Kabila, who alone is empowered to commute the death sentences,
is known to have granted only one pardon: a thirteen-year-old soldier
who had been sentenced to death in late March 1998 for killing a Red
Cross worker in Kinshasa was granted clemency on April 18, 1998. The
second president of the Military Court told Human Rights Watch in a late
1998 interview that under the decree law establishing the court those
condemned to death could be legally executed immediately following
judgment. This violates principles both of the Congolese code of
criminal justice and international norms.   Since its establishment, the
functioning of this court has been marked by prolonged delays, a lack of
due process, and a propensity to impose and execute the death penalty.
In interviews with Human Rights Watch conducted in late 1998, court
officials, including the then acting commander president of the court
and a military public prosecutor, expressed their strong support for
death sentences in order to eliminate "suspected rebels, common
criminals, ill-disciplined military, and collaborators with the enemy."
According to reliable sources on the ground, more than 250 executions
have been carried out by the Court of Military Order since its
inception.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Court has increasingly been used for political repression, notably
to punish nonviolent opposition and to muzzle outspoken critics of the
government in the media and NGO sectors. Authorities have also used the
court to punish civilians accused of economic crimes such as illicit
dealings in foreign currency.

<br>
Your excellency:

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch is writing to you to express its alarm at the
executions in three groups since January 28 of nineteen people condemned
to death by the special Court of Military Order. We are also deeply
concerned about the fate of another sixty-one death row inmates
currently held at Pavilion 2 in the Reeducation and Penitentiary Center
of Kinshasa (former Makala central prison) whose execution appears
imminent according to reports. Your government carried out the recent
executions despite its pledges to suspend capital punishment, conveyed
in a July 1999 letter from the Minister of Human Rights to Mary
Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, and most recently
reiterated by the same minister in his December 10 speech marking the
annual anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We
urge your government to abide by its own pledges and immediately suspend
any further executions ordered by the Court of Military Order pending
the review of that institution.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch fears that the execution of the sixty-one death row
inmate presently held at Kinshasa's central prison is imminent. A total
of nineteen civilians and military personnel were executed in three
groups: on January 28 and 31, and on February 2.  Executions took place
at the Provincial Inspectorate of Police and at Tshatshi military camp
in Kinshasa, and at Maluku, about 60 km from the capital.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your government established the Court of Military Order by presidential
decree in August 1997, shortly after it seized power. The Court
initially had a narrow mandate of trying soldiers accused of
disciplinary and other offences in the capital Kinshasa and its area in
a drive to suppress an upsurge in criminality and dissent in the ranks.
Following the outbreak of war in August 1998 against the rebel Congolese
Rally for Democracy and its foreign backers, your government expanded
both the geographic coverage and legal mandate of the court with the
addition of new chambers at several centers in Katanga, Kasai, and Bas
Congo regions, and the establishment of roving courts. Since its
establishment, the functioning of this court has been marked by
prolonged delays, a lack of due process, and a propensity to apply and
execute the death sentence. The Court has increasingly been used for
political repression, notably to punish nonviolent opposition and to
muzzle outspoken critics of the government in the media and NGO sectors.
Authorities have also used the court to punish civilians accused of
economic crimes such as illicit dealings in foreign currency. Human
Rights Watch urges your government to abolish the special Military Court
and establish an independent judiciary that respects due process.
Regular military courts should only handle cases of military personnel
who are accused of committing military crimes. Trials in military courts
should afford the accused all gaurentees of fair trial enshrined in
international standards and Congolese justice codes, including the right
to appeal and the right to counsel. The government should guarantee the
competence, independence, and impartiality of all tribunals to ensure
that civilians are not tried before military courts. Civilian and
military judges, prosecutors, and other court officials should not be
subject to intimidation or harassment related to their duties.


 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More specifically, we urge your government to abide by the "Safeguards
guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death
penalty," adopted by Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of
25 May 1984, that are representing a broad level of consensus by the
international community. The Safeguards provide guidance for those
countries that have not abolished the death penalty. The following
Safeguards are of particular relevance to the aforementioned cases:

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the
crime shall not be sentenced to death, nor shall the death sentence be
carried out on pregnant women, or on new mothers, or on persons who have
become insane.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Capital punishment may only be carried out pursuant to a final
judgement rendered by a competent court after legal process which gives
all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial, at least equal to those
contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, including the right of anyone suspected of or charged
with a crime for which capital punishment may be imposed to adequate
legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to appeal to a court
of higher jurisdiction, and steps should be taken to ensure that such
appeals shall become mandatory.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon, or
commutation of sentence; pardon or commutation of sentence may be
granted in all cases of capital punishment.

 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Capital punishment shall not be carried out pending any appeal or
other recourse procedure or other proceeding relating to pardon or
commutation of the sentence.


</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanking you in advance for your urgent action on this matter, we
remain,

<br>
Sincerely Yours,<br>
