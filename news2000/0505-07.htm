- May 5 - On May 22, The Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious 
Understanding will recognize Bishop Basilio do Nascimento, an East Timorese 
Catholic bishop, with its Peace Activist Award for his work in preserving 
peace amongst his fellow East Timorese, despite a quarter of a century of 
bloody, civil conflict between East Timor and occupying armed forces from 
neighboring Indonesia. Fellow countryman and  1996 Nobel laureate Dr. José 
Ramos-Horta will accompany Father Filomeno Jacob, a priest who led the 
resistance campaign against the Indonesian militia in East Timor, to the 
Tanenbaum Center's Sixth Annual Award Ceremony and Memorial Lecture, 6-7:30 
PM at the Park Avenue Synagogue (50 East 87th Street, NYC). The annual 
awards recognize the outstanding contributions of individuals to the cause 
of interreligious understanding around the world.

<p>The Tanenbaum Center's Peace Activist Award recognizes religious leaders 
whose lives and freedom are at risk because of their efforts to promote 
peace and reconciliation in the face of violent conflicts. Through it, the 
Tanenbaum Center works to assist religiously-motivated individuals to 
prevent, ameliorate or resolve conflicts around the world, whether they are 
in Northern Ireland, Bosnia or East Timor. In this respect the Center's 
objectives are fourfold:

<ul>
<li>To provide a degree of international recognition to individuals who are 
risking their lives and their freedom in the cause of peace;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To create a measurable degree of impact on the ground of the recipients' 
home countries through case studies which should help not only our 
activists but others striving for peace to better understand when and how 
to intervene to resolve conflict;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To inspire activists in other hotspots to follow the example of the Peace 
Activists and to assist these other peacemakers in adapting to use in their 
own countries the techniques which our Awardees have applied;</li>
</ul>
<p><ul>
<li>To provide visibility to the Tanenbaum Center which could make a future 
channel for assistance and aid from international donors and other NGOs to 
these hotspots</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tanenbaum Center plans to identify ten additional Peace Activists each 
year to help form a global network of religiously-motivated leaders who can 
consult each other in a time of crisis. A Tanenbaum Center-coordinated 
website (to be established) will also help develop, maintain and inform 
this network of activists.

  
<p>"Bishop do Nascimento, East Timorese parish priests like Father Jacob, 
and the other individuals recognized by the Tanenbaum Center at this year's 
Award Ceremony have been instrumental, via their words and their 
conscientious actions, in healing the wounds of interreligious strife in 
their communities and countries," said Dr. Georgette Bennett, President of 
the Tanenbaum Center. "The past year has witnessed religion as a decisive 
factor in a number of ongoing conflicts-from a slow rebuilding of an entire 
nation in East Timor to continuing efforts at a lasting peace in Northern 
Ireland, and as an element in the Presidential elections here in the 
U.S.  The Tanenbaum Center intends to play a vital role in organizing and 
assisting these peace activists to overcome religious differences and 
resolve the national struggles they embody."

<p>It is especially appropriate and poignant that this year-in the wake of the 
Pope's recent visit to the Holy Land and his formal apologies to Jews for 
persecution by Christians-that Dr. Eugene Fisher is recognized for his 
efforts with the Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum Award for the Advancement of 
Interreligious Understanding. His writings have helped clarify areas of 
prejudice and misunderstanding between Catholics and Jews. Dr. Fisher is 
Director for Catholic-Jewish Relations of the Commission on Ecumenical and 
Interreligious Affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and 
the only American Consultor to the Vatican Commission for Religious 
Relations with the Jews (appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1981). William 
Cardinal Keeler, Archbishop of Balitmore will be presenting Dr. Fisher's award.

<p>Among the other honored guests and award recipients attending this year's 
ceremonies will be advertising guru Jerry Della Femina, principal of the 
advertising firm Della Femina/Jeary and Partners and a respected innovator 
in creative advertising since the 1960s. Mr. Della Femina will be honored 
with the Tanenbaum Center's Media Bridge Builder Award for his 
philanthropic work in building bridges of communication between 
communities. Mr. Della Femina has long used his eminence in advertising for 
philanthropic purposes and was recently named by Advertising Age as one of 
the 100 most influential advertising people of the century.

<p>Actor James Earl Jones will take a key role in the ceremony, and Felicia 
Rashad will serve as Master of Ceremonies. Entertainment will be provided 
by the Boys Choir of Harlem.
<p>


For interested media, if you would like to speak with Father Jacob, Dr. 
Ramos-Horta, Dr. Bennett, or any of the other award recipients please 
contact John Showalter (x. 511) or Kona Luseni (x. 531), at (212) 780-1900. 
The Father's and Dr. Ramos-Horta's New York visit is extremely brief, and 
advanced, scheduled, interviews are strongly recommended.


<p>The Tanenbaum Center is a nonsectarian organization whose sole purpose is 
to apply interreligious understanding as a tool to prevent and resolve 
intergroup conflicts in the workplace, classroom, and the public arena. Our 
namesake, Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, was a world-renowned leader in 
ecumenism, human rights, and social justice.  The Center was established 
shortly after his death in 1992 to carry on his life's work to promote 
interfaith understanding and take action against the divisive and 
destructive effects of religious and ethnic hatred.
