<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- October 5 - Ralph Nader today sent a letter to the
co-chairmen of the Commission on Presidential Debates demanding an
apology for his exclusion from a viewing room, separate from the
presidential debate auditorium, at UMass Boston Oct. 3. Nader had a
ticket to attend.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader was prevented from entering the viewing room by a security guard
and three state troopers. “One of the police officers told me that I
would face arrest if I continued to remain on the premises,” Nader wrote
in the letter. Nader was also prevented from appearing at a pre-arranged
live broadcast at the Fox News trailer, which was located at the site
with the full permission of the CPD.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The Commission’s decision to deploy public officers at a public
university to bar me from viewing the presidential debates and
participating at a subsequent onsite newscast because of my political
viewpoints and affiliation with the Green Party violates both
Massachusetts State and federal civil rights laws.”

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader called the CPD’s actions “outrageous and unlawful behavior” and,
in the spirit of a settlement, proposed that by Oct. 10 he receive a
written apology, that a contribution of $25,000 be sent to the nonprofit
Appleseed Center for Electoral Reform at Harvard Law School, and that he
receive assurance that he will not be barred from attending any other
CPD presidential debate venues for which he has an invitation from the
press or a ticket.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Should you not respond by Tuesday morning to these three requests, the
Nader 2000 Campaign will pursue its legal remedies on Tuesday, October
10th,” Nader wrote.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader had been given the transferable ticket to access the debate
viewing room by a student of Northeastern University.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also today in Boston, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
reviewed a case brought by Nader and voters challenging the corporate
funding of the CPD. If successful, the case could have a dramatic impact
on the structure of the remaining presidential debates this month,
according to attorney John Bonifaz of the National Voting Rights
Institute.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 5, 2000

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr.<br>
Mr. Paul G. Kirk, Jr.<br>
Co-Chairmen<br>
Commission on Presidential Debates

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mssrs. Fahrenkopf and Kirk:

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday night October 3, 2000, I attempted to view the first
presidential debate hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates
(CPD) at the University of Massachusetts.   Though I have been
excluded from participating in the debates by the arbitrary and unfair
standards set by your private, bi-partisan company, I was given a
transferable ticket by a university student to observe the debates in
a separate auditorium reserved apart from the corporate-sponsored
audience in attendance for the two-party show.  I planned to view the
debates so that I could appear as a guest to comment on the debates
later that evening on a live broadcast by Fox News Channel from a
trailer occupied by them, at the debate site, with the full permission
of the CPD.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">En route to the event, ticket in hand, and members of the press
present and recording everything at my side, I was met by a security
consultant, Mr. John Vezeris, who was flanked by three uniformed state
troopers.  The security consultant, while declining to present any
credentials, told me that he was “instructed by the Commission” to
advise me that “it’s already been decided that, whether or not you
have a ticket, you are not invited.”  One of the police officers told
me that I would face arrest if I continued to remain on the premises.
The security consultant repeatedly refused to divulge who from the CPD
ordered this action and subsequent attempts by my campaign to
establish who ordered this coercive expulsion with the aid of police
officers have not resulted in any names.  I was stopped a second time
by the same police when I attempted to visit the news trailer for a
broadcast I was formally invited to do by Fox News Chief Executive
Roger Ailes and which had been arranged from the premises.   According
to today’s media reports, Mr. Kirk claims I was excluded as a “point
man for the protests,” when I took no part in those protests and when
demonstrations by pro-Gore supporters did not result in similar
exclusionary treatment for Vice-President Gore.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Green Party candidate for the office of President, I am not
used to being barred by police officers from attending public events
for which I hold a ticket.  Nor am I accustomed to being physically
prevented from attending approved on-site newscasts and reaching
national audiences from venues where I am invited to appear.  Indeed,
the Commission’s decision to deploy public officers at a public
university to bar me from viewing the presidential debates and
participating at a subsequent onsite newscast because of my political
viewpoints and affiliation with the Green Party violates both
Massachusetts State and federal civil rights laws.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accordingly, in the spirit of a proposed settlement offer for this
outrageous and unlawful behavior, I am seeking the following by 10
a.m.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tuesday morning October 10th:<br>
1) An official, written apology from both of you, on behalf of
Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Albert Gore, Jr.<br>
2) A contribution of $25,000 to the nonprofit The Appleseed Center for
Electoral Reform at Harvard Law School.<br>
3) An assurance that I will not be barred from attending any other CPD
presidential debate venues for which I have an invitation from the
press or a ticket.


</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should you not respond by Tuesday morning to these three requests, the
Nader 2000 Campaign will pursue its legal remedies on Tuesday, October
10th.

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely yours,

<br>
Ralph Nader


<br>

Cc: Ms. Janet H. Brown, Executive Director
 <br>
Vice-President Albert Gore, Jr.
 <br>
Governor George W. Bush
