- April 25 - The "limited" national

missile defense system proposed by President Clinton fails to meet

the four criteria that the President has outlined as the basis for

the deployment decision later this year, concludes a new study

released today in Washington.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The broadest and most in-depth study on the subject to date,

"Pushing the Limits: The Decision on National Missile Defense," was

produced by the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers and the Council

for a Livable World Education Fund. The 57-page report presents a

comprehensive analysis of each of the criteria, examines the history

of national missile defense in U.S. politics, and warns of the impact

employing such a faulty system would have on the future of U.S.

security.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report finds that a precipitous decision to deploy unproven

and very costly missile defenses later this year "will diminish

overall U.S. and international security, increasing rather than

reducing nuclear dangers."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Clinton has said he will decide later this year whether

to endorse deployment of a national missile defense that is designed

to detect, intercept, and destroy a small number of long-range

missiles that might be fired at the U.S. He has said his decision

will be based on four criteria: the readiness of the technology, the

impact on arms control and international relations, the cost, and the

nature of the missile threat.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Estimates of the cost of the proposed, ground-based national

anti-missile system have increased dramatically beyond early

estimates, according to "Pushing the Limits."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The public and the policy makers may soon feel NMD 'sticker

shock,'" warns report author and deputy director of the Coalition,

Stephen Young. "It is unwise to commit to deploy and invest tens of

billions of dollars on national missile defense when the technology

remains unproven and appears unlikely to work against even a minimal

threat."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new cost estimate released today by the non-partisan

Congressional Budget Office (CBO) puts the total cost of building and

deploying the three phases of Clinton's proposed "limited" national

missile defense system at $59.4 billion from 1996 through 2015. The

new CBO estimate raises the cost projection for the first phase of

the system by over 15%, to $29.5 billion. Until now the Pentagon had

projected the cost of building and running a single site of 100

interceptors at $25.6 billion through from 1996 through 2015.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also points out that the proposed system does not meet

the "technical readiness" criteria. With only three of 19 scheduled

tests performed, it has not been shown to work under real-world

conditions. A sound decision on technical readiness for deployment

cannot be made this year, according to the report. Other anti-

missile systems have been put through far more rigorous testing. The

"Safeguard" missile defense system, deployed in 1975 and canceled

after one day of operation, was put through 165 missile flight tests.

The "Patriot" theater missile defense system was tested 114 times.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The operational effectiveness of the system cannot be

demonstrated by the end of this year, even if the third test is

successful because the system will not have been tested against

realistic countermeasures," says Young.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some officials maintain that a new missile threat to the U.S.

might potentially emerge by 2005, but the joint Coalition/Council

study points out that the maturation of the threat is not certain.

North Korea has agreed to freeze its missile flight test program and

may improve relations with the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. Rather

than deploying an unproven missile defense, the United States can and

should pursue diplomatic, political, and economic tools to prevent
or

delay the maturation of any new missile threats, according to the

report.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new "Pushing the Limits" report points out that it would be

far cheaper, even for countries like North Korea, to develop

countermeasures that could overwhelm or confuse the proposed system

than it would be for the U.S. to increase the capabilities of its

missile defense.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clinton administration insists the proposed system should not

affect arms control goals. It seeks modifications to the 1972

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow for the system. Russia has

rejected proposals to modify the ABM Treaty. On April 14, President

Putin warned that if the U.S. withdraws from the ABM Treaty, "...we

will have the chance and we will withdraw not only from the START II

treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and

control of strategic and conventional weapons."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Authorizing deployment could put at serious risk the nuclear

non-proliferation regime and efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons,"

said Young. This week, many of the 180+ nations at the

Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference will express concern

about the negative impact of national missile defense.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Pushing the Limits" report notes that in response to

deployment, China is likely to expand its relatively small strategic

nuclear arsenal, increasing tensions across Asia. In addition, the

report also emphasizes that America's NATO allies have all expressed

concerns about U.S. plans for missile defense.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A precipitous decision to deploy would strain relations with our

allies, ignite a new nuclear arms race, encourage a stronger

Russian-Chinese strategic partnership, hurt international efforts to

address ballistic missile threats, and severely weaken the global

nuclear non-proliferation regime," warns Young.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Pushing the Limits" report recommends that the president

should allow the time necessary to reach an understanding with Russia

on how best to reduce potential new missile threats while

simultaneously achieving verifiable reductions in existing nuclear

arsenals and reducing the risk of accidental nuclear war.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 17, a group of 25 senators, including Senate Majority

Leader Lott (R-MS), wrote President Clinton that they will reject a

U.S.-Russian agreement to further reduce nuclear arsenals and

modification of the ABM Treaty if it does not allow the U.S. to

develop even more expensive -- and as yet unproven and unworkable --

sea- and space-based national missile defenses. In 1996, the Senate

Budget Committee conservatively estimated that such a layered system

would cost $124 billion to build and maintain through 2015.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the most extreme supporters of missile defense are allowed to

have their way, the United States would throw away the historic

opportunity to reduce verifiably the real threat of thousands of

Russian nuclear-armed missiles for the sake of trying to build a

fantastical 'Star Wars' defense system that will cost taxpayers over

$100 billion and take many more years to develop," notes John Isaacs

of the Council for a Livable World.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers is an alliance of 17

nuclear non-proliferation and arms control organizations committed
to

a practical, step-by-step program of action to reduce nuclear

dangers. The report, "Pushing the Limits," is available on the Web
