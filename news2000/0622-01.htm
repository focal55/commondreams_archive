- June 22 - Human Rights Watch condemned today Israel's
introduction of legislation permitting the holding of hostages, a war
crime.  The draft "Imprisonment of Combatants not Entitled to Prisoner
of War Status Law" passed its first reading in Israel's Knesset
yesterday by a vote of 22 to 6.

<p>Human Rights Watch criticized the legislation in letters on Wednesday to
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin,
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg, and
Knesset committee chairs Amnon Rubinstein and Dan Meridor.  While
sharing concern over the fate of Israelis missing in Lebanon, the
organization said that there is no acceptable justification for
committing war crimes.

<p>In a case in April involving Lebanese detained as hostages, Israel's
Supreme Court ruled that administrative detention cannot be used to hold
individuals as "bargaining chips."  Lower courts have since ordered the
release of all but two of the hostages, Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and
Mustafa al-Dirani.  A ruling on their case has been postponed until July
12, apparently to allow the introduction of yesterday's legislation.

<p>"Israel's highest courts have acknowledged that the Lebanese hostages
are held illegally,"  said Hanny Megally, the executive director of
Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. "The Knesset
should not attempt to sidestep the courts."

<p>Israel kidnaped Lebanese nationals `Obeid and al-Dirani from Lebanon in
1989 and 1994, respectively.  Israeli officials admit that the two are
being held for future use in negotiations to gain the release of Israeli
nationals gone missing in Lebanon.  As such, their detention is both a
grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a violation of Israel's
legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.  They should be immediately released.

<p>Human Rights Watch also criticized the sweeping language of the
legislation, which provides almost unlimited powers to the military to
detain civilians arbitrarily and indefinitely.  This raises serious
concerns that the legislation could be used to detain persons based on
their political beliefs, and not for any actual acts they have
committed.


<p>A backgrounder with Human Rights Watch's analysis of the draft
legislation is attached.

<p>Human Rights Watch Backgrounder

<p>Israel's Proposed "Imprisonment of Combatants not Entitled to Prisoner
of War Status Law, 5760-2000"<br>
June 2000


<p>International humanitarian law categorically prohibits hostage-taking.
On April 12, 2000 Israel's highest court ruled that the administrative
detention of Lebanese nationals as "bargaining chips" -- hostages -- was
illegal under Israeli domestic law, making Israel's continued detention
of Lebanese nationals Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid (held since 1989)  and
Mustafa al-Dirani (held since 1994) as hostages a violation of Israeli
domestic law as well. On June 11, 2000, in a transparent attempt to
legitimize an illegal situation,  the Israeli Cabinet unanimously
approved draft legislation entitled "Imprisonment of Combatants not
Entitled to Prisoner-of-War Status Law, 5760-2000". The legislation
passed its first reading in Israel's Knesset on June 21, 2000. The draft
legislation not only fails to end `Obeid and al-Dirani's  illegal
detention, it opens the way to sweeping human rights violations against
them and others by appearing to legitimize prolonged, arbitrary
detention.

<p>Article 1 of the draft law declares the law to be consistent with the
Geneva Conventions, while Article 2 gives the Commander of the General
Staff of the Israel Defense Force powers to detain indefinitely, without
charge or trial, "a person who belongs to a force fighting against
Israel or a person taking part, directly or indirectly, in hostile
activities of the said force," but who is not a prisoner of war under
the Third Geneva Convention.

<p>However, under international humanitarian law, all detainees who are not
entitled to protection as prisoners of war are nevertheless protected
under the Fourth Geneva Convention (Relative to the Protection of
Civilian Persons in Time of War).  Those protections include the
prohibition of hostage-taking (Article 34), the prohibition against
individual or mass forcible transfer (Article 49), and the requirement
that internment (detention without charge or trial) "may be ordered only
if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary"
(Articles 42 and 78).

<p>Hostage-taking is unacceptable under any interpretation of international
humanitarian law, and like the prohibition of torture,  is never subject
to derogation.  Human Rights Watch views with alarm Prime Minister Barak
statements that the draft legislation is "aimed at ensuring that we can
detain people from organizations fighting us for as long as our people
are held by those groups,' and more specifically, is intended to
continue Israel's illegal detention of Lebanese nationals Sheikh `Abd
al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani. This intention is borne out in
Article 13(A) of the legislation, which includes "transitional
provisions" that extend its application to "a combatant who is not a
prisoner of war who is held by state authorities on the date of its
commencement."

<p>Similarly disturbing is the sweeping language of the draft legislation,
which may permit the indefinite internment of persons who pose no threat
to state security, a violation of both international humanitarian law
and international human rights law.  For example, Articles 2 and 3(A)
allow imprisonment based on the IDF Chief of Staff's  assertion that an
individual "belongs to a force combating Israel or [is] a person taking
part, directly or indirectly, in hostile activities of the said
force."   Judicial review is limited to determining whether a detainee
"is a combatant who is not a prisoner of war." (Article 4)  The
legislation fails to provide the Minister of Defense with guidelines for
determining that a particular force is hostile, is engaged in hostile
activities, that hostile activities have not ended, or even that it is a
force.  This raises serious concerns that the legislation could be used
to detain individuals based on their political beliefs, and not for any
actual acts they have committed.  The draft law provides no mechanism
for  reviewing or challenging such decisions, as the Minister of
Defense's determination "shall serve as decisive proof in this matter."
(Article 9)

<p>Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani are protected persons
under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and subject to the protections of
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  Their
kidnaping from Lebanon and prolonged incommunicado detention, including
periods of prolonged solitary confinement, violate both the ICCPR's
prohibition of arbitrary detention and the Fourth Geneva Convention's
prohibition of hostage-taking and forcible transfer.    Hostage-taking,
unlawful transfer, and unlawful confinement are also grave breaches of
the Fourth Geneva Convention, that is to say, war crimes.

<p>Human Rights Watch calls on the Israeli government to immediately
release Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani, and to
publicly commit not to use any other individuals as hostages.  Israel
has a legal obligation to ensure that no one in its custody is deprived
of rights guaranteed them under international humanitarian law and
international human rights law. Legislation like the "Imprisonment of
Combatants no Entitled to Prisoner of War Status Law" are concessions to
political expediency that undermine both the rule of law in Israel and
the integrity of international  law, and should not be allowed to stand.
