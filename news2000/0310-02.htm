- March 10 - Nearly three-quarters

of a century after science teacher John Scopes was found guilty

of breaking Tennessee law for teaching evolution, most Americans

have a strong opinion about what should be taught in America's

science classes.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a new nationwide poll on the subject, conducted by DYG

Inc., the polling firm headed by Daniel Yankelovich, and commissioned

by People For the American Way Foundation, 83 percent of Americans

say Darwin's theory of evolution belongs in the nation's science

classes.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the public dispute is most often portrayed as an "either-or"

choice -- evolution vs. creation -- most Americans don't see it that

way, the poll shows. About 70 percent of Americans don't see

any conflict at all between the two explanations for how life

came to be. The majority of the public clearly does not buy

the notion put forward by the creationists that you must choose

between the Bible and evolution.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most Americans see evolution as scientific theory and creation

as a matter of belief, and believe that the two are not mutually

exclusive. While they want schools to acknowledge that many people

have religious beliefs concerning the beginning of life, they do not

want evolution to be replaced by creationism, nor do they want the

two taught side-by-side as equal but competing scientific theories.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To put it simply, this poll shows that most Americans believe

that God created evolution," said Ralph G. Neas, president of

People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF), which commissioned

the poll in the wake of public outcry over last year's decision

by the Kansas Board of Education to drop evolution from its

statewide science standards.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike previous polls that touch on the dispute over evolution vs.

creationism, this one focused exclusively on this topic, producing
an

in-depth, nationwide look, for the first time, at how Americans see

both subjects and how they want schools to handle them. Many

Americans say schools should teach about creationism, but only a

small fraction (less than 3 in 10) want it to be taught about in

science class as science, either alongside evolution (13 percent)

or exclusively, in its place (16 percent).
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Earlier polls have really only scratched the surface of this very

complex and nuanced issue," said Daniel Yankelovich, president of the

polling firm DYG Inc. "Three or four survey items are not enough to

understand how the public really thinks about evolution and

creationism in the classroom. We developed an entire, comprehensive

survey to exploring the numerous and critically important facets

involved in public opinion on this issue."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the majority of Americans favoring evolution, 20 percent

say schools should teach only evolution, with no mention of

creationism; 17 percent say schools should teach only evolution

in science class, but would permit religious explanations for

the origins of humankind to be covered in another, non-science

class; and 29 percent would allow creationism to be discussed

along with evolution in science class, but it should be made

clear that evolution is scientific theory while creationism

is a belief, not science.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public is clearly not supportive of attempts by a small,

extreme minority to force their religious beliefs into science

classrooms either as "Creation Science," (which almost half of

Americans have never heard of) or by stripping the teaching of

evolution from the curriculum. The poll shows that the majority of

Americans (60 percent) reject the Kansas Board of Education's

1999 decision to delete Evolution from its state science standards.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"One of the most remarkable things this poll shows us is

that, with this kind of broad public support, there shouldn't

be any controversy at all about teaching evolution," said Neas.

"The fact that there is a debate shows us how effective a very

small but very vocal group has been in imposing their views

on our schools."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The poll should also be a warning to public officials and

schools," Neas continued. "If they cave in to pressure to eliminate

evolution or to force creationism into the science classroom, they

will be acting against the views and wishes of most Americans."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The polling was carried out by DYG Inc., the opinion research

firm founded and still headed by Daniel Yankelovich and Madelyn

Hochstein. PFAWF's purpose in commissioning the poll was to

inform the public debate over the issue by letting the American

people's views be known and understood.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In all the media debate over the Kansas Board's decision to drop

evolution, the one missing ingredient was what the people thought,"

said Neas. "We conducted this poll to complete the picture."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evolution vs. creation is a perennial hot topic, one that is sure

to heat up in Kansas again with state education board elections on

the horizon and half of the seats up for grabs. Recent disputes over

a textbook disclaimer in Oklahoma and a charter school that wanted
to

teach creationism in Rochester, N.Y., are just a few recent

examples of the perpetually simmering debate started when Charles

Darwin published his revolutionary theory a century and a half

ago.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes to how schools should handle what has been portrayed

as a conflict between evolution and creation, the public agrees on
a

number of basic principles, although they haven't formulated a

detailed idea of precisely how schools can resolve the matter in

practice. There is broad agreement that schools should acknowledge

that some people have creationist beliefs and even teach about those

beliefs -- but not as science. There is also a strong consensus not

only that schools should teach evolution, but that how they handle

the subject along with creationist beliefs should be a matter of
national policy, not just a local matter to be decided by each state

or school district.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll results also suggest that, while the public is

overwhelmingly supportive of teaching evolution, their knowledge is

quite limited about the details of evolutionary theory, pointing to
a

need for greater efforts to inform and educate the public about

evolution. At today's news conference in Washington, PFAWF announced

that it has begun planning such a campaign to coincide with the 75th

Anniversary this year of the Scopes Trial.
