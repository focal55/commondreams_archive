- May 22 - The Sierra Club today released a new TV ad running in key
     states that examines Texas Governor George W. Bush's record on
     fighting air and water pollution.  The ad includes testimony from a
     mother from suburban Houston and an angler from rural Texas.
</font>
<p>
     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have too many children on breathing machines, too many people with
     asthma.  We are in a crisis situation," said Tamaro Maschino from
     Seabrook.  She opposes granting a permit to a new chemical plant that
     would add more pollution to Houston's already smoggy skies.  She has
     joined with other Republican mother from Seabrook to oppose the
     permit.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
     The ad will run in St. Louis, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Lansing this
     week.  And in Ohio next week.  The ad asks viewers to contact Texas
     Gov. George W. Bush to urge him to oppose Federal legislation to
     weaken penalties for clean air and water violations.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
     Ed Parten, an avid angler from Kingwood, Texas is also featured.  He
     and other anglers have become increasingly concerned about Texas'
     increasing water pollution and the effect it's having on their sport.

     emissions in the Houston area by   issuing three new emissions permits
     to American Acryl, a new chemical plant located in Pasadena, Texas, a
     suburb of southwest Houston.  The permits are expected to allow the
     plant to emit about fifty toxic chemicals into the air, which would
     add pollution equal to 9000 cars.  Local residents called on Gov. Bush
     and the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission to conduct a
     study of the cumulative effects of this additional toxic pollution.
     So far, the government has refused to do so.

     Documentation: S. 1053 is sponsored by Sens. Kit Bond R-MO, Gramm
     R-TX, Hutchinson R-TX.  This bill would weaken the sanctions
     provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990 (signed into law by President
     George Bush).  Under existing law, communities suffering from
     unhealthful levels of air pollution cannot receive federal highways
     funds for new  highway construction that would add to congestion,
     sprawl and smog until they had taken steps to reduce existing levels
     of air pollution, and account for the increase of new pollution caused
     by the new highways.  (Federal funding for highway safety measures are
     exempt from this sanction.)  If this sanction is lifted, it would
     remove incentives for cities to adopt clean air plans, and encourage
     them to build highways that make problems worse.
