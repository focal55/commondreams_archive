- March 29 - National interest for removing four dams on the Lower Snake River has reached an all-time high, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent budget watchdog which supports removal of these dams. 

<p>Today TCS released a list of over 1,000 endorsers.  These organizations, businesses, and prominent individuals all agree that retiring the four Lower Snake River dams is the best option for salmon and federal taxpayers.  

<p>“Support for dam removal has escalated within the past months.  With thousands turning out for hearings, and organizations and interests representing millions signing on, momentum has reached an all-time high,” said Kathleen McNeilly, Director of the Snake River Campaign at Taxpayers for Common Sense. 

<p>A national endorsement drive effort, led by Taxpayers for Common Sense and several conservation organizations today released a list of over 1,000 endorsers of removing the four Lower Snake River dams.  The list includes hundreds of national and regional organizations, over 500 Alaska commercial fishermen, businesses, Native American Tribes, scientists, and others from 49 states, Australia and Japan.  The list also includes prominent individuals such as singer-songwriter Carole King, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and actor Adam West. 

<p>“This is a national, not just regional, concern.  The nation is engaged in this debate because it wants to preserve this national treasure, but also because endangered or extinct fish could cost U.S. taxpayers billions,” said McNeilly. 

<p>Several stocks of Lower Snake River salmon and steelhead are already extinct or headed towards extinction.  Removing the four hydroelectric dams on the Lower Snake River in eastern Washington State is the best way to save the fish.  Even such removal is not a silver bullet that will fully solve the problem, but rather the cornerstone of a multi-faceted, long-term effort that will have the best chance of success. 

<p>Taxpayers could be liable for billions to tens of billions of dollars in compensation payments to Columbia River Basin tribes if the fish go extinct.  In exchange for the land of what is now the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, the U.S., through 

<p>Governor Isaac Stevens of the Washington Territory assured Columbia River Basin tribes there would be no threat to their fish-dependent economy.  He guaranteed their fishing rights “as long as the sun shall shine.”  

<p>Fortunately, the tribes do not want taxpayer money, and do not want to sue.  They want the fish they were promised, that are an integral part of their spiritual, cultural, and economic way of life.  But if the fish go extinct, there won’t be many options left.  

<p>Compensation to several other tribes from similar treaty violations is being paid right now, including $53 million, plus an additional $15 million per year, to the Colville tribes for violations from the construction of the Grand Coulee dam.  And, $39 million to the Nez Perce tribe for compensation for two dams constructed in the Clearwater River drainage.

<p>An additional, smaller cost to federal taxpayers is that they subsidize the full cost of operating and maintaining the navigation waterway on the Lower Snake River, an estimated $35 million per year.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, barge navigation receives the highest percentage of subsidy of any form of freight transportation in the U.S., including rail and highway.  

<p>“On the Lower Snake River, waterway users pay none of the navigation costs, even though they are loud voices for keeping the dams.  This is not fair to federal taxpayers,” said McNeilly. 

<p>More than $3 billion has already been spent on failing fish mitigation programs in the Columbia River Basin, according to an April 1998 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO).  Most of this comes from Northwest electricity ratepayers, but a smaller amount comes from federal taxpayers.  Much of this money has been spent on increasingly elaborate and impractical “techno-fixes”, including loading juvenile fish onto barges and trucks to carry them around the dams.  

<p>“It simply doesn’t make sense to give boat rides to fish, and then subsidize a costly barge system to move goods up and down the river,” said McNeilly.  

<p>In Washington, DC, it’s no secret that these salmon mitigation programs are costly and ultimately won’t prevent extinction.  The Republican-majority House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water stated in 1998:  “The Committee has previously expressed its deep concerns regarding the vast sums of taxpayer dollars pouring into this project with little apparent effect.  For all its reliance on technological fixes and fish barging, there is no clear evidence that the salmon recovery efforts in the Northwest are, or will become, successful.”    

<p>Many opponents of dam removal argue that it’s too expensive to remove the dams,
which only generate around 5% of the region’s electricity.  But, removing these dams would only add a few dollars each month to regional electric bills, which would still remain the lowest in the nation.  Meanwhile, taxpayers from every state, from Alaska to Florida, would be liable for the costs of fish extinction.  These same taxpayers have electric bills significantly higher than those in the Pacific Northwest. 

<p>Federal agencies and Congress must stop their footdragging and order the dams removed, before it is too late.  When the government fails in its duty as a trustee, it is the taxpayers who often must pay.  Taxpayers and tribes have a mutual interest in preventing another costly tragedy on the Snake River.  The government must take action to keep its treaty, save the salmon and save the taxpayers. 

<p>For the complete list of almost 1,000 endorsers is available on the TCS web site at <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/snake">www.taxpayer.net/snake</a> in both <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/snake/groups2.html">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/snake/endorselist.pdf">PDF</a> formats.  Or call TCS at 202-546-8500 x112 to have the list faxed.
