- June 27 - By relying on an inappropriate test to award state college scholarships,
Michigan is denying deserving students whose race, ethnicity, and educational
disadvantages are factors in lower test scores, a coalition of civil rights organizations
charged today in a federal lawsuit. </font>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition, which includes the American Civil Liberties of Michigan, represents five
graduating seniors and the Michigan State Conference of the NAACP.  They are calling for
the State of Michigan to revise its selection criteria, allowing for a fairer method that
considers grade point average and other measures of achievement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The State of Michigan has a chance here to fix or compensate for some of the problems in
our educational system," said Kary L. Moss, Executive Director of the ACLU of Michigan.
"Instead, officials are making it worse by using a selection criteria that everyone knows will
help least those who need it the most." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's lawsuit is only the second such action in the nation challenging the use of
standardized tests as the sole criterion for making scholarship awards, Moss noted. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moss said the coalition is seeking an injunction requiring the state to immediately discontinue
use of the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) High School Test as the
sole criterion for awarding Michigan Merit Award Scholarships.  Others in the coalition are
the state NAACP, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit charges that the use of MEAP test scores discriminates against high school
students on the basis of race, ethnicity, and educational disadvantage.  The MEAP test has
never been validated as a means of assessing individual student achievement but rather was
designed to measure school performance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By relying on the MEAP test to award scholarships, the state of Michigan is misusing the
test," Moss said. "All students should be judged fairly, by looking at the range of their
accomplishments as individuals, in the same way that college and universities evaluate
applicants." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 34 percent of eligible white students qualified for scholarships in 1999, only 7 percent
of African American students, 20 percent of Hispanic students, and 19 percent of Native
American students taking all four MEAP tests qualified. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That is, 1 in 3 white test takers received a scholarship, whereas only 1 in 14 African
American test takers, 1 in 5 Hispanic test takers, and 1 in 5 Native American test takers
received a scholarship. Disparities also occurred among the state's school districts, with
students of wealthy suburban school districts consistently reporting higher test scores than
those in large urban or smaller rural districts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first lawsuit to bring such charges, <i>Sharif v. New York State</i>, challenged New York's
practice of using the Scholastic Achievement Test scores to grant the prestigious Regents
and Empire awards.  A federal court agreed that the practice violated Title IX of the 1964
Civil Rights Act because it had a discriminatory effect on girls and directed the state to
devise a non- discriminatory method of selection. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In today's case, <i>White v. Engler</i>, the groups are charging that the selection process violates
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funding from
engaging in race discrimination, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups are asking a federal district court to order the State to discontinue use of the
MEAP test to award merit scholarships, adopt new procedures for selection, and
reevaluate the scholarship eligibility of those students denied scholarships this year. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They emphasized that they are not asking for those students who have been announced as
winners to lose those scholarships.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anita White, who lives in Ypsilanti, attends Belleville High School, and was denied a merit
scholarship, said that she wants all kids who deserve it to get scholarships to attend college.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A scholarship would have made a big difference in my choice of a college," said Ms.
White.  She  has a grade point average of 3.4, ranked 53 out of a class of 345, is a member
of the National Honor Society, and will be attending Central Michigan University in the fall. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Donald E. Heller, Assistant Professor of Education at the University of
Michigan, and an expert witness in the case, "The evidence is clear that the Michigan Merit
Award Scholarship program will do little to further the legislation's stated goal of increasing
access to higher education in Michigan." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Based on what we know from existing research," he added, "a great number of these
awards are likely to go to students who will attend college anyway.  Many of these students
come from relatively wealthy school districts that already send a large percentage of their
high school graduates on to college." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Michigan Merit Award Scholarship Program was created by the Legislature in 1999
and is funded by the state's share of revenues from the multi-state settlement agreement with
tobacco manufacturers.  Scholarship awards of $2,500 are available to graduating seniors
attending in-state colleges, and $1,000 to students attending out-of-state colleges.  Winners
are selected on the basis of obtaining minimum scores on the MEAP test.  The first
Michigan Merit Award Scholarships were based on the MEAP High School Tests
administered in Spring 1999; scholarship awards were announced last month for students
who will begin their post-secondary education in the Fall of 2000. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students in the case are represented by Kary Moss, Executive Director, and Michael
Steinberg, Legal Director, of the ACLU of Michigan; Leonard Mungo, of the Michigan
State Conference of the NAACP; Pat Mendoza and Marta Delgado of the Mexican
American Legal Defense & Educational Fund; Michael Pitt, Peggy Goldberg Pitt, and Judy
Martin, as Cooperating Attorneys for the ACLU of Michigan, and Adele P. Kimmel of
Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, P.C. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copies of the complaint will be available on the ACLU of Michigan Web site at <a href="http://www.aclumich.org" target="new">www.aclumich.org</a>. </font></p>
