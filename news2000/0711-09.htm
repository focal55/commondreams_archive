- July 11 - As the Republican National

Convention approaches, the Legal Action Project of the Center to

Prevent Handgun Violence has served notice to the gun industry that

the industry's high hopes of a George W. Bush presidency are in

vain. The Legal Action Project is stepping up its efforts to

represent gun violence victims in lawsuits against the industry.

Since 1989, the Legal Action Project has pioneered innovative

theories of gun industry liability against gun manufacturers and

sellers in an attempt to hold the gun industry accountable for

dangerous and irresponsible practices. The Legal Action Project's

legal theories have been used in the past to bring claims on behalf

of individual victims of gun violence and are now being used by the

cities and counties suing the gun industry. The Center represents

over two dozen of the cities and counties that have filed suits

against the industry.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By intensifying its pro bono work for victims, the Center is

sending a message to gun manufacturers and dealers that relying on

the possibility that Governor George W. Bush will be elected

President of the United States will not insulate the industry from

legal accountability for its misconduct. The gun industry recently

broke off settlement talks with the Department of Housing and Urban

Development over threatened public housing authority lawsuits in

the hopes that a George W. Bush presidency will result in federal

legislation to prohibit municipal lawsuits. As Governor, Bush

signed legislation banning local government lawsuits against the

gun industry in Texas last year.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The gun industry seems to be forgetting that even if Bush is

elected President and even if he manages to push legislation

shielding the gun industry from municipal lawsuits through the new

Congress, victims of gun violence still can and will file private

lawsuits against the gun industry," said Dennis Henigan, Director

of the Legal Action Project. "Innocent victims of gun industry

misconduct will continue to assert their legal rights and we are

ready to help them."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 29, the Center announced a significant new lawsuit

brought on behalf of victims of a series of racially-motivated

shootings on July 4 weekend of last year. African-American, Asian

American and Jewish victims of violent white supremacist Benjamin

Nathaniel Smith brought suit in Chicago against the gun trafficker,

gun dealer and gun manufacturers whose conduct allowed Smith easy

access to handguns in the illegal market. The defendant dealer,

Old Prairie Trading Post, sold over sixty handguns over a two-year

period to trafficker Donald Feissinger, who then sold two handguns

-- one a Bryco Arms .380, the other a .22 caliber Ruger, to Smith.

Smith had tried to buy a gun from a legitimate dealer, but was

turned away because a background check revealed he was under a

domestic restraining order. The suit charges that Old Prairie

knew, or should have known, that it was dealing with a gun

trafficker who was buying such a large volume of handguns to sell

them into the illegal market. The suit also names Bryco Arms and

Sturm, Ruger, charging that the gun makers failed to set standards

for the retail sale of their firearms that would prevent such

large-volume sales.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May, the Center also brought suit in Michigan for shooting

victim Ronald Rissman, who was shot by a mentally disturbed

individual in June of last year. The suit was brought against gun

dealer Target Sports, Inc., which sold a handgun to the shooter

even thought the store had been warned of his mental instability.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the California Court of Appeals recently opened the

door to a possible new trial in Dix v. Beretta, the first case ever

brought against a gun maker for failure to "personalize" guns to

prevent their use by children and other unauthorized users. Center

lawyers had filed this case against gun manufacturer Beretta for

the parents of a teenage boy who was accidentally killed by his

friend with a gun the friend thought was unloaded. A jury had

ruled 9-3 against the parents, but the appeals court found there

was reason to believe that at least one of the jurors was biased in

favor of Beretta. A new trial may be ordered in the case.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These cases demonstrate our determination to hold the gun

industry accountable to innocent victims for its choices that

increase the risk of violence," said Mr. Henigan. "The gun

industry may be counting on George W. Bush and a future pro-gun

Congress to rescue it from the city cases, but the industry will

always be vulnerable to courageous victims willing to assert their

rights. Smith &amp; Wesson finally concluded that the only way to

truly protect itself from liability for irresponsible conduct is to

act responsibly. Eventually, that simple truth will dawn on the

rest of the gun industry as well."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence was founded in 1983 to

reduce gun violence through education, legal advocacy, research,

and outreach to the entertainment community. Chaired by Sarah

Brady, the Center's national initiatives include violence

prevention programs for youth, education programs on the risks

associated with guns, legal representation for gun violence

victims, reform of the gun industry, and research on the risks

associated with guns and on the efficacy of gun control laws. More

Control, can be found on our website at <a href="http://www.cphv.org">www.cphv.org</a>.</i></font>
