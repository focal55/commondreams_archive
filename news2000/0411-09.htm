- April 11 - At a press conference 
here today, Defenders of Wildlife, the National Family Farm 
Coalition, Friends of the Earth, GREEN and an alliance of more than 
180 other groups called for a congressional investigation of the 
American Farm Bureau Federation, saying that the organization does 
more to hurt than to help family farmers. 

<p>A new Defenders report, Amber Waves of Gain, highlights many 
areas of Farm Bureau operations and gives numerous examples of how 
the Farm Bureau is an organization that may have financial 
interests in mind rather than the interests of family farmers. The 
groups also staged press conferences in seven other cities across 
the country. 

<p>"We started taking a close look at the Farm Bureau when it 
threatened the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction program," said 
Rodger Schlickeisen, Defenders of Wildlife president. "We found 
out that the Farm Bureau not only fights every imaginable 
conservation measure, but it often advocates policies that are 
detrimental to family farmers. It pushes an extremist right-wing 
agenda that has nothing to do with farming and it benefits unfairly 
from its nonprofit tax status. Farm Bureau membership is mostly 
people who have little to do with agriculture." 

<p>Amber Waves of Gain demonstrates that the Farm Bureau 
is an intricate web of interconnecting business interests, 
including insurance companies, agribusiness giants and banks, 
linked with the national federation, the 50 state bureaus and more 
than 2,800 county bureaus. 

<p>During today's press conference, Schlickeisen said the Farm 
Bureau should be investigated for unfair business practices and for 
deceptive representation to its own membership. The Farm Bureau 
avoids paying nearly $61million annually in taxes on unrelated 
business income, he said. 

<p>"In 1996, Congress slipped into law a gift for the Farm Bureau," 
said Schlickeisen. "It exempted the bureau from paying taxes on 
virtually any kind of membership dues. Since the Farm Bureau 
collects membership dues from millions of people who aren't 
involved in agriculture, this translates into tens of millions of 
tax-free dollars from these unrelated business activities." 

<p>Although the bureau claims to be the "voice of agriculture," 
many of its activities support factory farm operations that are 
putting family farmers out of business. 

<p>"Dean Kleckner, the former president of Farm Bureau, gave us a 
formula to survive," said Chris Petersen, a county Farm Bureau 
board member from Iowa. "He told us to adopt new technologies, put 
our families to work in town and raise more crops and livestock. 
We've done all this and we're still losing thousands of family 
farmers each year while Farm Bureau and agribusiness giants team up 
to make billions of dollars." 

<p>Bill Christison, president of the National Family Farm 
Coalition, said the Farm Bureau is rampant with conflicts of 
interest and misrepresentation in developing its farm policy. In 
addition to unwavering support for Freedom to Farm and unfair trade 
policy, "Farm Bureau thinks crop insurance is the fix for our 
failed farm policy," said Christison. "The truth is that crop 
insurance is currently not working for the family farmer, the 
taxpayer or the environment. But it does yield excessive profit for 
Farm Bureau insurance companies." 

<p>Frank Kloucek, a South Dakota state senator, said the Farm 
Bureau facilitates market concentration through its alliances and 
corporate partnerships, and this is crushing family farmers. 
"Family farmers and ranchers have been robbed by the corporate 
raiders long enough," said Kloucek. "Farm Bureau must be held 
accountable for its misrepresentation of independent agriculture 
producers." 

<p>"These are just a few of the reasons all of the groups 
represented today believe Farm Bureau needs to be closely 
examined," said Schlickeisen. "Additionally, Farm Bureau pushes 
agendas to control markets and pushes corporate-friendly 
legislation, both of which eliminates family farmers' ability to 
compete. All the while, Farm Bureau leadership is profiting from 
the suffering of rural America." 

<p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth declared, 
"Over the past 30 years the Farm Bureau has consistently opposed 
sound environmental positions to protect the health of our land, 
air and water. The Farm Bureau has been overtly hostile towards a 
safe and healthy environment for the American people. The Farm 
Bureau is not protecting the family farm, the Farm Bureau is 
presiding over the destruction of the family farm and the 
destruction of the American environment." 

<p>The first county farm bureau was founded in 1911 by the Chamber 
of Commerce in Binghamton, N.Y. Today, the Farm Bureau has grown 
into one of the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington, 
recently listed by Fortune Magazine as the 14th most powerful. 
Because of the Farm Bureau's intricate web of nonprofit and 
for-profit businesses, it is hard to estimate the organization's 
total worth. However, it takes in more than $200 million annually 
from membership dues, more than $12 billion in revenue from its 
cooperatives and more than $6.5 billion annually in net insurance 
premiums.
