- July 4 - Over 50 East Timorese held a peaceful demonstration today outside the
      entrance of the U.S. Mission in Dili, East Timor from 5pm to 7:30pm.
      Participants sang and lit candles along the street in front of the
      American diplomatic installation in memory of the more than 200,000 East
      Timorese who died as a result of the Indonesian invasion and
      occupation.&nbsp;</font>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main purpose of the gathering was to recall the supporting role the
      United States government played in what many observers have classified as
      a genocide in East Timor, and to demand justice and accountability for
      U.S. actions. In doing so, the demonstrators distributed pamphlets to all
      the attendees of the U.S. independence day party. Titled <i>Honoring
      the 224th Anniversary of American Independence, 1776-2000 . . . by
      Remembering 24 Years of U.S. Support for Indonesia's Crimes in East Timor</i>,
      the pamphlets detailed the complicity of the United States in Indonesia's
      illegal war and occupation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The demonstrators made five demands of Washington:&nbsp;<br>
      1) a release of all U.S. government documents relating to East
      Timor;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) the establishment of an independent commission in the United States
      to investigate the nature and extent of U.S. complicity with Indonesia's
      crimes in East Timor;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) an apology for the U.S. role;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) reparations from the U.S. to the people of East Timor; and&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) active U.S. support for an international tribunal to investigate and
      prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in East Timor
      from 1975-1999. (See the text of the pamphlet below.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1975-1999 Alliance for Justice is made up of human rights
      activists, women's rights advocates, students, members of families
      victimized by Indonesia's war, and others. It works to ensure justice and
      accountability for the suffering and the destruction that took place in
      East Timor during the Indonesian invasion and occupation.</font></p>

</center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page 2:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 4, the people of the United States of America celebrate the
      anniversary of the country's declaration of independence, and their
      commitment to the principles of democracy and justice for all. It is in
      this spirit that we congratulate the American people and, at the same
      time, raise the issue of U.S. complicity in East Timor's suffering. As
      Ambassador Holbrooke contends, democracy and accountability must go
      hand-in-hand. While an honest assessment of history and a process of
      accountability are sometimes uncomfortable, they are vital for the health
      of all societies. Such a process will help facilitate socio-political
      healing in East Timor, strengthen American democratic values and
      institutions, and ensure good future relations between our two countries.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="US Policy"></a>U.S. Policy Toward East Timor, 1975-1999</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Americans of good will, including some government officials, made
      important contributions to East Timor's freedom struggle. And today,
      numerous Americans are helping to rebuild East Timor. While we appreciate
      such solidarity, we cannot ignore the fact that the overall U.S. policy
      toward East Timor from 1975 until Sept. 1999 was one of complicity.
      Indonesia could not have carried out its December 7, 1975 invasion and
      brutal war of conquest, maintained its almost 24-year-long occupation of
      East Timor, and waged its final campaign of terror and destruction last
      September without significant military, economic, and diplomatic backing
      from the U.S. government. From 1975-1999, the U.S. sold approximately
      US$1.2 billion worth of weapons to Indonesia, and trained well over 2,600
      Indonesian soldiers trained in the U.S., and countless more in
      Indonesia--including the notorious Kopassus troops. The U.S. also provided
      over $2 billion in economic aid to Jakarta. Below are some highlights.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>December 1975</b>: Only hours after U.S. President Gerald Ford and
      Secretary of State Henry Kissinger leave Jakarta, the Indonesian military
      launches a full-scale invasion of East Timor. According to diplomats and
      CIA officials, Ford and Kissinger gave Indonesian dictator Suharto the
      green light to invade. During a press conference in Hawaii while returning
      from Jakarta, Kissinger states that, given a choice between East Timor and
      Indonesia, the U.S. &quot;had to be on the side of Indonesia.&quot; The
      State Department later reports that 90 percent of the weapons used during
      the invasion are from the U.S.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page 3:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>December 7, 1975-1976</b>: The U.S. prevents effective United
      Nations action to end Indonesia's invasion and occupation. As Ford 's U.N.
      Ambassador, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, later writes, regarding East Timor,
      &quot;The [US] Department of State desired that the United Nations prove
      utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given
      to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>January 1976</b>: A U.S. State Department official states that
      &quot;In terms of the bilateral relations between the U.S. and Indonesia,
      we are more or less condoning the incursion into East Timor. . . . The
      United States wants to keep its relations with Indonesia close and
      friendly. [It's] a nation we do a lot of business with.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1977</b>: President Jimmy Carter increases military aid to
      Indonesia, authorizing the sale of US$112 million worth of weaponry.
      Beginning in late 1977, the Indonesian military uses newly-acquired,
      U.S.-made aircraft to bomb and napalm the East Timorese in refuge in the
      mountains. Tens of thousands die as a result. An Australian government
      report describes the period as one of &quot;indiscriminate killing on a
      scale unprecedented in post-World War II history.''</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nov.-Dec. 1991</b>: On Nov. 12, Indonesian troops fire on an unarmed
      crowd at Dili's Santa Cruz Cemetery and kill hundreds. On Dec. 10, Bush
      administration envoys meet with embattled Indonesian military leaders in
      Java, telling them &quot;we do not believe that friends should abandon
      friends in times of adversity.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1993-1999</b>: Although pressure grows from the American public and
      from many in Congress, President Bill Clinton largely continues the
      policies of his predecessors. His administration authorizes hundreds of
      millions of dollars in weapons sales, provides more than US$500 million in
      economic aid, and ignores the intent of Congress by providing training to
      the Indonesian military.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Early Sept. 1999</b>: Despite countless killings and massive
      destruction by the Indonesian military and their militia, the Clinton
      administration refuses to end military and economic support for Indonesia.
      U.S. Ambassador to Jakarta, Stapleton Roy, tells reporters that
      &quot;Indonesia matters, East Timor does not.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sept. 10, 1999</b>: In the face of rapidly intensifying public
      pressure and Congressional outrage, U.S. President Bill Clinton announces

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) Create an independent commission composed of academic experts on
      U.S. foreign policy, East Timor and Indonesia, human rights advocates, and
      international legal specialists with full subpoena power to investigate,
      analyze, and report on U.S. involvement in Indonesia's 1975 invasion of
      East Timor and the subsequent occupation;</font></p>

      destruction that took place during Indonesia's invasion and occupation;
      and, on this basis,</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) Begin discussions with representatives from the various sectors of

      Government to the people of East Timor; and</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) Actively support the establishment of an international war crimes
