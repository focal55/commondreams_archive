- October 3 - The following was released

today by Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun

Violence:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the first pieces of legislation signed by George W. Bush

as Governor, which allows the carrying of concealed handguns in

public, came under fire today from the Los Angeles Times. Today's

Times story, "Felons Get Concealed Gun Licenses under Bush's

'Tough' Law," again demonstrates the serious problems created by

the carrying concealed handgun legislation in Texas. According to

the Times' in-depth research, Texas has licensed more than 400

criminals with prior convictions since the inception of the

concealed-handgun program, and more than 3,000 other licensees have

since been arrested. Governor Bush signed the law permitting

concealed-carry in 1995, and in 1997 signed another law removing

churches, hospitals, nursing homes and amusement parks from the

list of places where carrying concealed handguns was prohibited.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Jim Brady in 1995, the Governor wrote that "(he)

does not believe allowing responsible, law abiding citizens who are

trained and licensed to carry weapons for their personal protection

will lead to an increase in crime." Despite the Governor's hopes,

a recently released report from the Violence Policy Center

demonstrated that Texans with concealed-carry licenses were 66

percent more likely to be arrested for firearms violations than

Texans who did not have licenses.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The LA Times has now demonstrated conclusively what other

research has suggested," said Sarah Brady, Chair of Handgun

Control. "Lax laws that do not permit the police to exercise

discretion about who can carry hidden handguns let criminals

through the cracks. And even citizens without prior convictions

carrying handguns in their waistbands and purses are tempted to

misuse them in the heat of the moment."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Bush has allowed dangerous criminals to carry

concealed handguns, and put his own state's citizens at risk,"

Mrs. Brady said.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 1999 form letter sent out by the Bush campaign in response

to inquiries on the gun issue, the Governor echoes the gun lobby's

mantra of 'tough laws and long sentences' for those who use guns to

commit crimes. In the letter from the campaign, Bush also wrote

about the carrying concealed handgun law, "I believe this

legislation is helping make Texas a safer place to live."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, as pointed out by both the Houston Chronicle

(12/8/99) and The Wall Street Journal (3/29/00), more than

700 criminals who were known to possess guns -- because they

used them to pass the training standards for concealed handgun

licenses -- were not prosecuted by state authorities, despite

the applicants' failure of the background check process and

prohibition from gun ownership.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Concealed Truth," a report released by the Center to Prevent

Handgun Violence this year, demonstrated that since peaking in

1992, the violent crime rate dropped 30 percent (through 1998) in

states that restrict or prohibit carrying concealed handguns

compared to a decline of less than 20 percent in states that eased

restrictions on carrying hidden guns in public as a way to attack

crime in their communities. The disparity in crime reduction is

even greater for robbery -- the crime theoretically most affected

by changes in carry laws similar to those implemented in Texas. In

states that only issue concealed carry permits to individuals who

can demonstrate the need to carry a concealed handgun or prohibit

the practice altogether, the robbery rate declined 44 percent --

nearly twice as much as the decline in states with Texas-style

laws.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's no wonder that the NRA's chief lobbyist has said publicly

that Governor Bush has never denied them any part of their

legislative agenda," Mrs. Brady said. "Concealed-carry of hidden

handguns was at the top of the NRA's wish list throughout the '90s.

The danger it presented was always clear. Now that the danger is

objectively verified, we urge Governor Bush to reconsider his

support for the dangerously permissive carrying of concealed

handguns."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by

Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun

violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law

enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across

the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun

control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than

500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it the nation's

largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More

information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to

Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our website at
