- October 3 - Ralph Nader today called his exclusion from the
presidential debates an “affront to democracy,” and cited a long list of
Americans from all points in the political spectrum who have said that
he should be given the chance to debate the major party candidates.
This list includes: Senators Russ Feingold, Paul Wellstone and Barbara
Boxer, former Senator Howard Baker, Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.,
Governors Jesse Ventura and Gary Johnson, former Governor Mario Cuomo,
former third-party presidential candidates John Anderson and Barry
Commoner, and media figures Brian Lamm, John McLaughlin, Don Imus, Phil
Donahue, and William F. Buckley.

<p>Polls have consistently shown support for having Nader and Pat Buchanan
in the debates. A September 13 Zogby poll showed that 58.7 percent want
Nader to participate in the presidential debates, while only 34.2
percent agree with the decision of the Commission on Presidential
Debates and major party campaigns to exclude him. A FoxNews/Opinion
Dynamics Poll from July showed that 64 percent of the American people
want to see Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan in the debates, a number that
was duplicated in many informal polls, including an NBC News Today Show
Poll.  Numerous polls have also shown that the public disagrees with the
15 percent threshold set by the CPD for including candidates in the
debates.

<p>Additionally, many newspapers have editorialized in favor of including
Ralph Nader in at least one presidential debate.  These include the
Washington Post, the Seattle Times, the Houston Chronicle, the L.A.
Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, The (St. Paul) Pioneer Press, The
Christian Science Monitor, and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette.

<p>NARROW SCOPE OF PARTY-CONTROLLED DEBATES THWARTS DEMOCRACY

Bush, Gore allowed to ignore important issues due to Nader lock out

<p>BOSTON, MASS. – The first presidential debates at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston will bring to light a democracy that has been
weakened by the great concentration of corporate power over our society,

<p>Ralph Nader said today.

<p>“On a campus closed even to its own students, before an audience and
moderator handpicked by the Democrats and Republicans, Al Gore and
George W. Bush will discuss a narrow set of issues and avoid proposing
serious ways to shift power from big business to workers, consumers,
taxpayers and voters. Both men do not want to step on the toes of their
major corporate paymasters,” Nader said.

<p>Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, has been barred from
participation in the debates despite polls showing that he has the
support of millions of voters and that the majority of Americans want to

see him in the debates.  Nader was excluded by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a private company created and controlled by the
two major parties and funded by many of the same corporations –
including beer, auto and tobacco firms – that contribute to both the
parties.

<p>“Commanding the money, the media and the access to both the ballots and
debates, the Republican and Democratic parties have designed and
enforced a closed system that largely shuts out significant new parties
and old and new ways to strengthen our democracy,” Nader said. “It is
the citizenry who will lose out Tuesday night as Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore
are allowed to sidestep subject matters that are important to millions
of Americans and the solutions that would improve their lives.”

<p>Important issues that will be avoided by Bush and Gore at Tuesday’s
debate include:

<p>Universal, Accessible Health Insurance for All Americans Now

<p>More than 45 million Americans lack basic health insurance, and one
third of seniors have no prescription drug coverage. Nader promises to
ensure single-payer, universal, accessible health care for all Americans

now. He also proposes to negotiate patient-affordable prices of all
prescription drugs developed with taxpayer money.  However, in the
interim there should be a liberal benefit for all elderly accompanied by

government-negotiated prices so that they are affordable to the
government that pays for these medicines just the way the Veterans
Administration and the Department of Defense do now.  Generic drug
company competition should also be encouraged. Both Gore and Bush oppose

controlling any prices of prescription drugs developed with taxpayer
money. Gore supports only gradual steps on health care and Bush opposes
universal health care.

<p>Ending Corporate Welfare

<p>Massive federal and state corporate welfare giveaways, through
subsidies, handouts and bailouts for almost every major industry in our
country, result in the loss of hundreds of billions annually.* Those
billions could be used back in communities and neighborhoods to repair
and expand schools, clinics, libraries, public transit systems, drinking

water plants and many other public works in gross disrepair. These
monies can also be used to abolish child poverty and fund universal
health insurance. Nader proposes to end these corporate welfare
giveaways, while Bush and Gore both support corporate giveaways and
never raise the issue between them.

<p>Empowering Working People

<p>One third of U.S. workers make less than $10 per hour, hardly enough for

even two workers to support a family in today’s “new economy;” and less
than 10 percent of American workers in the private sector are unionized.
<p>
Nader advocates a repeal of the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act, which is
keeping tens of millions of low-wage workers from forming trade unions.
He would renegotiate international trade agreements to fully protect
labor rights and American jobs, and institute environmental and
consumer-rights standards. Nader also advocates a living wage of $10 per

hour, which will allow all working people to stay above poverty. Bush
and Gore do not support a living wage or the repeal of the Taft-Hartley
Act and are both strong supporters of NAFTA and the World Trade
Organization opposed by labor.

<p>Ending Cash Register Politics

<p>Year after year, big business invests in politicians and political
parties by giving them millions of dollars, and in return, those
businesses get corporate welfare, weak law enforcement and tax breaks
worth billions of dollars. The biggest single obstacle to honest, just
government action – government of, by and for the people – is the
corruption of special-interest money in our election campaigns. Nader
accepts no corporate or any other kind of soft money or PAC
contributions, and would end cash register politics with full public
financing of public campaigns, believing public elections should be
financed just like public libraries and parks. Bush and Gore, who both
benefit from hundreds of millions in corporate soft money and PAC
contributions, oppose public financing of elections.

<p>Other important decisions that will be avoided by Bush and Gore on
Tuesday include: media concentration; racism; renewable energy; criminal

justice systems; environmental protections such as solar power and
fuel-efficiency standards; consumer justice; weak enforcement against
corporate crime, fraud and abuse; and the disastrous war on drugs, Nader

said.

<p>“Democracy is in a serious crisis when more than 94 million voters –
more than half of all eligible voters – stay at home and turn their
backs on the precious right to select the people who will lead the
nation. Debates controlled by the two major parties about a narrow set
of issues that do not present solutions to our most pressing problems
further thwart voter interest and participation,” Nader said.

<p>“Throwing away your vote is throwing it in the direction of the two
major parties who have wasted democracy in this country.”
