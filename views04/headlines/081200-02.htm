A federal judge on Friday barred the Los Angeles Police Department
from using some of the proactive tactics that police in Philadelphia
employed against protesters during the Republican National Convention.
<p>U.S. District Judge Dean E. Pregerson ordered the LAPD not to seize
any puppets or written material from the headquarters building used by
people planning protests at the Democratic National Convention.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font>The judge also ruled that the police cannot enter the protest center
to investigate alleged building and safety or fire code violations
without a federal court order, unless there is an emergency.
<p>However, Pregerson denied the protesters' request that he order the
police to halt their surveillance at the protesters' MacArthur Park-area
Convergence Center.
<p>Though they did not obtain as broad a ruling as they sought, attorneys
for the activists said they were very pleased with Pregerson's order.
<p>"We're delighted with the judge's injunction. It is critical to our
client's interests," said attorney Carol A. Sobel.
<p>"It also sends a message that the Constitution won't be suspended
during the convention," said her co-counsel, Daniel P. Tokaji, a staff
lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
<p>Deputy City Atty. Debra Gonzales said the restrictions imposed by the
judge present no problems for the police. "He still gives us the ability
to get search warrants, make arrests" and conduct surveillance, she said.
"He hasn't tied our hands."
<p>And Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, who heads the LAPD's convention planning unit,
said he was not alarmed by Pregerson's decision. He would not say,
however, whether police ever intended to search the Convergence Center or
whether officers had planned to target the group's organizers for arrests
before protest marches begin.
<p>Earlier, LAPD officials expressed admiration for the tactics used by
the Philadelphia Police Department, which they watched firsthand as part
of their preparation for the Democratic convention. Some of those
tactics--including raids, seizure of protest materials and the arrests of
leading activists--precipitated the filing of federal civil rights
lawsuits now pending.
<p>Pregerson acted in response to a suit filed Thursday, alleging that
the LAPD had violated activists' 1st Amendment rights and conducted a
campaign of "unlawful harassment" of individuals gathered at the
Convergence Center to plan protests during the upcoming convention.
<p>Indeed, Pregerson said in court that the plaintiffs' attorneys had
produced evidence that, if true, showed that civil rights violations
already have occurred.
<p>In addition, LAPD Capt. Michael R. Moore, the new commander of the
Rampart Division, said in a sworn declaration filed Friday that if one of
the allegations made in the plaintiffs' suit was accurate it represented
police misconduct. And Moore said he already has ordered an internal
affairs investigation of the incident, which involved LAPD officers'
temporarily taking into custody two women after they left the Convergence
Center on Wednesday night.
<p>One of the women was cited for jaywalking, even though, according to
her account, she only stepped off a curb and then immediately returned to
the sidewalk. The other woman was released without any charges being
filed against her. Both women were handcuffed. They said they had been
treated abusively by the officers who took them to the Rampart station.
<p>In a court declaration filed Thursday, protest organizer Lisa Fithian
expressed particular concern that the LAPD might seize puppets from the
center, just as the Philadelphia police confiscated and destroyed puppets
at a similar protest center during the Republican National Convention
earlier this month.
<p>Colorful handmade puppets have become ubiquitous props in
demonstrations around the country. They first drew wide notice during the
anti-globalization protests at the World Trade Organization conference in
Seattle last year.
<p>Gonzales, the deputy city attorney, said in court Friday that the
police had no intention of seizing any puppets, as long as they were just
that--puppets and not illegal weapons in disguise.
<p>Sobel reiterated in court Friday a point that the plaintiffs stressed
in their papers: that people making puppets at the center had been given
a copy of the Los Angeles Municipal Code regulating the thickness of wood
that can be used in any object displayed during a demonstration.
<p>Pregerson said that if the city had no intention of confiscating any
puppets, he could see no reason why the city would object to an order
prohibiting police from doing so.
<p>At that point, Gonzales said the city had no problem with such an
order "if the puppet is a puppet and not something illegal."
<p>Pregerson responded: "If there's something criminal, you can apply for
a search warrant."
<p>The plaintiffs also objected to a July 15 search of the center by
police and fire officials, claiming that it was meant to interfere with
the protest activities taking place there. But Gonzales said the officers
went to the center for a trespassing investigation.
<p>The deputy city attorney said that an LAPD officer had thought it was
suspicious that there were people in the building because it had been
vacant for several years. "She also saw several cars with out-of-state
license plates parked near the building, which caused her to believe that
the people she saw in the building might be trespassing."
<p>Sobel took issue with that statement, contending that by the time the
officers entered the building, they knew that the protesters were
lawfully occupying it.
<p>In any case, Pregerson ultimately ruled that Los Angeles officials
cannot enter the center "on the basis of purported administrative
violations, including building and safety, zoning and fire code
violations, in the absence of a prior order issued by this court."
<p>He also said, "nothing in this order is intended to preclude [police]
from entering the Convergence Center or conducting any other activity
pursuant to a warrant . . . or through other legal means."
<p>At one point, Pregerson said that the plaintiffs had asked for a very
broad injunction, which also would have prohibited any police
surveillance of the center, including photographing, videotaping and
viewing with binoculars.
<p>Before issuing his rulings, Judge Pregerson said that "this city has a
history of unfortunate riots. I can understand why the LAPD feels on a
hot summer day it wants to effectively protect citizens, the people here
for the Democratic National Convention and people coming to lawfully
protest."
<p>The judge said the LAPD's obligations include reasonably investigating
situations "that might lend themselves to violence."
<p>He said that in the current "pressure cooker" environment, "tensions
run high and some officers may have behaved inappropriately." Pregerson
said he was making no judgments about that, but added that if some of the
activists' allegations were true, then the police had misbehaved. "That's
disturbing," he said.
