<p>ATLANTA  --        Lisa Fair, a top executive in consulting firm 
Arthur Andersen's tax division, was pleased to learn that Georgia was 
rolling out a pioneering plan to provide free preschool to 4-year-olds from 
lower-income families. ``I feel like you should give each kid some equal 
opportunity,'' said the mother of three.	 
</P>
<P>  Her interest soared, though, when she learned a few years ago that the 
program was being expanded to all families, regardless of income, paid for 
with proceeds from a state lottery. Her daughter, Rachel, 4, now attends a 
free 6 1/2-hour program daily, where she has learned her ABCs, plays in the 
sandbox and does simple science experiments.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I'm really blown away,'' said Fair, 38, as Rachel and her classmates 
excitedly shouted out answers to questions about the stars and planets one 
day recently. ``I believe so much that this is the right answer to 
quick-start our educational system. We haven't done everything in Georgia we 
should -- by far -- but this program is so valuable.''	 
</P>
<P>  Georgia's ambitious undertaking -- more than 70 percent of the state's 
4-year-olds are now enrolled -- is but one indicator of the growing interest 
among states to offer extensive preschool programs to prepare youngsters for 
the demands of kindergarten and beyond.	 
</P>
<P>  The preschool movement is spreading across the country, much as the 
kindergarten concept caught fire in the United States at the turn of the 
century.	 
</P>
<P>  Forty-two states offer free or subsidized preschool, and enrollment has 
swelled to 750,000 children, according to a recent study by the Children's 
Defense Fund, an advocacy group. State spending on prekindergarten programs 
topped $1.5 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, up from $180 million in 1987.	 
</P>
<P>  While many of these programs are designed for poor children, a few states 
are following Georgia's lead, opening them to all children, regardless of 
income or neighborhood.	 
</P>
<P>  Oklahoma and New York are among those starting to make preschool 
universal. New Jersey has the ambitious goal of enrolling 44,000 of its 
poorest children in preschools, and state officials say the program will 
continue to grow.	 
</P>
<P>  Connecticut is at the midpoint of a five-year ``school readiness'' plan 
that has enrolled 6,500 children in all-day programs so far; officials hope 
to include all 3- and 4-year-olds eventually.	 
</P>
<P>  Delaine Eastin, state superintendent of public instruction for 
California, has proposed spending $5 billion to offer preschool for the 
state's 1.1 million 3- and 4-year-olds.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Universal preschool is one of the most important things that our nation 
can do for our children,'' Eastin said. ``It will give them a firm 
foundation that allows them to be successful in school and, ultimately, in 
life.''	 
</P>
<P>  Optional preschool is on the table in several states, including Maryland, 
which already has a state-funded program for 11,000 low-income 4-year-olds. 
A coalition of legislators and state officials proposes to expand it to 
cover all 4-year-olds.	 
</P>
<P>  Supporters acknowledge little chance of approval for the $75 million 
initiative this year, but say they hope to spark discussion of the idea to 
gain support down the road.	 
</P>
<P>  Virginia has 6,100 children enrolled in a 5-year-old preschool initiative 
designed for at-risk children. The program, which costs about $18 million a 
year, takes place in Head Start centers, private schools and child care 
centers.	 
</P>
<P>  For years, the federal government has subsidized prekindergarten 
education for economically disadvantaged children through programs such as 
Head Start. But the funding covers only a portion of those eligible, and 
parents with moderate or above-average incomes have had to pay for private 
preschools or keep their children home until kindergarten.	 
</P>
<P>  Some studies suggest that disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds who 
participate in good preschool programs reap the benefits for years.	 
</P>
<P>  A study at the University of North Carolina that for two decades tracked 
disadvantaged children -- some who attended an intensive child care program 
and others from a regular program -- found that those in the former group 
were more likely to attend college, hold jobs and delay parenthood.	 
</P>
<P>  Another study, started in Michigan in the 1960s with 3-year-olds, 
obtained similar results.	 
</P>
<P>  The preschool issue has caught the attention of the presidential 
candidates. A cornerstone of Vice President Al Gore's campaign is a proposal 
to spend $50 billion on free preschool for all of the country's 4-year-olds. 
On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose state increased 
prekindergarten spending 30 percent in the 1990s to $235 million, has 
proposed revamping Head Start to emphasize academics.	 
</P>
<P>  Preschool programs are costly, as even their supporters admit. Thus far, 
only Georgia has a fully funded program for all 4-year-olds whose families 
want them to go.	 
</P>
<P>  Some critics say the programs force taxpayers to foot the bill for 
working parents to have free child care, while others point to research 
suggesting that benefits of preschool fade in a few years.	 
</P>
<P>  Darcy Olsen, director of education and child policy at the Cato 
Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, said most children do not 
need preschool.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I question the premise that there is an overwhelming unpreparedness -- 
that kids are spending the ages of 0 through 5 doing nothing, and then go 
through some sort of shock when they get to kindergarten,'' she said. ``I 
just don't see the evidence for that at all.''
