BOGOTA  - Colombia's most-feared death squad
leader has alleged that U.S. anti-narcotics agents sought to
enlist his outlaw paramilitary gang to combat drug traffickers,
raising fresh fears of U.S. covert operations in this war-torn
Andean nation.
<p>In a television interview late Wednesday, Carlos Castano,
leader of the 5,000-member, ultra-right United Self-Defense
Forces of Colombia (AUC), said the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) asked him to force Colombian drug
traffickers to surrender to U.S. justice.<p>The plan, he said, was also a way of eroding the economic
mainstay of powerful Marxist rebel factions, whom U.S. and
Colombian authorities accuse of funding a long-running uprising
with proceeds from the booming cocaine and heroin trade.<p>In Washington on Thursday, the DEA declined to comment on
the allegations, which came less than two months after U.S.
Congress approved a record $1.3 billion package of mostly
military aid to help Colombia fight the drug trade and
guerrillas.<p>``The (U.S.) DEA...sent me a message and through that there
was a possibility of ending narco-trafficking in Colombia,''
Castano said Wednesday, speaking with RCN television in his
stronghold in northern Cordoba province.<p>``I received a call saying the DEA was opening the doors so
that Colombian drug traffickers could surrender to U.S. justice
and ... it needed a significant force in Colombia that would
induce these people to take that decision,'' added the
ultra-right warlord, who swapped his trademark combat fatigues
for a white knitted sweater and drab green pants.<p>At a news conference in Washington, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said State Department officials had
''no intention of soliciting his (Castano's) help'' but did not
address claims against the DEA.

<p>Some U.S. officials have accused Castano of funding his
anti-guerrilla crusade with drug money and insist he has heavy
backing from the military in his ``dirty war'' against suspected
leftist sympathizers. In practice, however, President Andres
Pastrana has done little to track him down.<p>The RCN interview with Castano coincided with a visit to
Colombia by a high-level U.S. delegation, including White House
anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey and Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering. President Clinton plans to visit Colombia on
Aug. 30.<p>The U.S. aid package has fueled fears that Washington
could be dragged deep into Colombia's civil conflict that has
cost 35,000 lives in just the last 10 years. Castano's comments
renewed suspicion that U.S. agencies have been carrying out
secret operations behind the back of the Colombian government
and the U.S. Congress.<p>``There are serious concerns about the nature of the U.S.
engagement and fears about covert operations and escalating
paramilitary activity,'' said Winifred Tate, Colombia specialist
at the non-governmental Washington Office on Latin America
(WOLA).<p>Allegations, though hard to prove, about U.S. covert
operations in Colombia are not new.<p>DEA agents were suspected of forging a covert alliance
linking the Cali drug cartel, Castano's paramilitary gunmen and
Colombian security forces to combat Pablo Escobar's Medellin
cocaine cartel in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<p>Washington-based Human Rights Watch has also accused U.S.
military intelligence officials of helping Colombia set up the
forerunners of today's illegal paramilitary groups in the late
1960s and early 1970s.
