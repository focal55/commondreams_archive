Durban, South Africa  --        At the International AIDS Conference 
in Geneva two years ago, they talked about ``The Gap'' between rich nations 
and poor, and the contrasting consequences it had on care and treatment of 
the sick.	 

<P>  Here, at the first of the group's meetings to be held on the African 
continent, they are calling it ``The Gulf.''	 
</P>
<P>  The gross discrepancies in the abilities of rich and poor nations to cope 
with the spread of HIV have become glaringly apparent at the 13th 
International AIDS Conference, where statistics released yesterday show that 
the average life expectancy in some African countries will soon drop to 33 
years or less.	 
</P>
<P>  Moreover, the population in some nations in southern Africa will actually 
decline as a result of AIDS, according to the estimates of population 
experts.	 
</P>
<P>  Amid those gloomy projections, the burgeoning movement to bring less 
expensive AIDS drugs to Africa has come to dominate conversation here, from 
the lecture hall to the coffee counter.	 
</P>
<P>  Following the path blazed by Pfizer Inc. and Boehringer- Ingelheim this 
year, American pharmaceutical powerhouse Merck & Co. announced plans 
yesterday to contribute free AIDS drugs -- this time in a deal with 
Botswana. The $100 million cost will be split between the company and the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.	 
</P>
<P>  ``This is going to make a world of difference for people living with HIV 
in Botswana, and that is something that cannot be ignored,'' said Merck 
spokesman Jeffrey Turchio.	 
</P>
<P>  Just before the opening of the conference, Boehringer-Ingelheim said it 
will provide free access to its antiviral drug nevirapine to HIV-
positive pregnant women and their newborn children -- a regime shown to cut 
by more than half the number of babies born infected with HIV.	 
</P>
<P>  But the gestures may have been lost the growing clamor for wealthy 
industrialized nations to do much more to forestall the predicted deaths of 
nearly 25 million Africans.	 
</P>
<P>  South African High Court Justice Edwin Cameron, a former labor lawyer and 
a white anti-apartheid activist, set the tone at a morning lecture named for 
Dr. Jonathan Mann, the passionate founder of the World Health Organization's 
Global Program on AIDS, who was killed with his wife in a Swissair plane 
crash off Nova Scotia in 1998.	 
</P>
<P>  A gay man with AIDS, Cameron mesmerized the 10,000 delegates at the 
opening lecture as he declared himself ``the living embodiment of the 
inequity of drug availability and access in Africa.''	 
</P>
<P>  He described how, on the brink of death three years ago, he was brought 
back to health by four pills a day of antiretroviral drugs he could 
purchase, on his salary as a judge, for about $400 a month.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Amidst the poverty of Africa, I stand before you because I able to 
purchase health and vigor,'' he said. ``I am here because I can afford to 
pay for life itself.''	 
</P>
<P>  Cameron left no doubt that he believes HIV is the cause of AIDS and that 
the costly drugs that quell replication of the virus are the key to his 
survival.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I should be dead approximately now,'' he said. `Instead, I am more 
healthy, more vigorous, more energetic, and more full of purposeful joy than 
at any time in my life.''	 
</P>
<P>  Cameron went on to lacerate his government's response to the crisis. ``A 
government that in its commitment to human rights and democracy has been a 
shining example to Africa and the world has at almost every conceivable turn 
mismanaged the epidemic,'' he said.	 
</P>
<P>  The response to an epidemic that is now estimated to have infected 20 
percent of South African adults, said Cameron, is ``a cacophony of task 
groups, workshops, committees, councils, policies, drafts proposals 
statements, and pledges.''	 
</P>
<P>  Turning his attention to drug companies, he chastised them for pledging 
to cut costs eight weeks ago but failing to follow through. The AIDS 
conference, he said, ``can demand urgent and immediate price reductions for 
resource-poor countries.'' He also called on drug companies to permit makers 
of generic drugs to set up shop in poor countries and make low-cost versions 
of the antiretroviral drugs, or let poor nations import them from low-cost 
producers abroad.	 
</P>
<P>  Nearly three-quarters of the 34 million people living with AIDS reside in 
sub-Saharan Africa, and as the death rate rises, the average life expectancy 
will fall sharply, said epidemiologist Karen Stanecki of the Census Bureau.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It's hard to comprehend the amount of mortality we will see in those 
countries,'' she said.	 
</P>
<P>  She projected that, by 2010, life expectancy will be 29 in Botswana, 30 
in Swaziland and 33 in Namibia and Zimbabwe. A recent report by the World 
Health Organization estimated that 35.8 percent of the population of 
Botswana is now HIV-positive. Without AIDS, life expectancy would be near 
70.
