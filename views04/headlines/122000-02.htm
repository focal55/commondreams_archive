WASHINGTON  - Hopes that economic globalisation will
bring
material well-being to all are likely to be frustrated as gaps
between the
haves and have-nots both between and within countries are likely
to grow wider
over the next 15 years, according to a new US intelligence report
released
here Monday. 
<P>
The 68-page report, 'Global Trends 2015', predicts that most of
Africa,
much of
the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South, Central and Southeast
Asia, and South
America, especially the Andean countries, could well be left far
behind the
wealthier and more technologically advanced countries, led by the
United
States. 
<P>
''(Globalisation's) evolution will be rocky, marked by chronic
financial
volatility and a widening economic divide,'' according to the
report, which
resulted from 18 months of consultations between the official
intelligence
community and non-governmental experts. 
<P>
''Regions, countries, and groups feeling left behind will face
deepening
economic stagnation, political instability, and cultural
alienation,'' the
report said. ''They will foster political, ethnic, ideological,
and religious
extremism, along with the violence that often accompanies it.'' 
<P>
Much of that violence could be directed against the United States
whose
''global economic, technological, military and diplomatic
influence will be
unparalleled among nations as well as regional and international
organisations
in 2015,'' according to the report. ''This power not only will
ensure
America's
pre-eminence, but also will cast the United States as key driver
of the
international system.'' 
<P>
That pre-eminence will undoubtedly attract opposition, and not
just from
discontented groups and individuals who could use anticipated
advances
information, communications, and weapons technology to mount
terrorist
attacks,
or ''information warfare'', against US territory and interests - a
major
concern of the incoming administration of President-elect George
W. Bush. 
<P>
States, including both adversaries and allies, may ''try at times
to check
what
they see as American 'hegemony,' according to the report, which
notes,
however,
that such efforts are unlikely to be translated into ''strategic,
broad-based,
and enduring anti-US coalitions,'' but rather ''tactical
alignments on
specific policies and demands for a greater role in international
political
and
economic institutions''. 
<P>
Under some more pessimistic scenarios developed by the report's
authors, the
United States could face a ''de facto geo-strategic alliance''
between
China, Russia, and India to counter Washington's dominance,
increased tensions
with Europe leading to a breakdown in the NATO alliance, or, in a
worst-case
scenario, growing regional tensions in Asia fuelled by rivalry
between Japan
and China that risks the outbreak of a major war in which the
United States is
pressed by Japan to come to its aid under their bilateral  defence
treaty. 
<P>
Eight key uncertainties in the national-security area cloud
prospects over the
coming 15 years, according to the report, which called on
Washington to
subject
these to periodic policy reviews. 
<P>
The first two involve the evolution of science and technology
(S&T) and how
they will be used by key actors.  
<P>
''What we do not know about the S&T revolution is staggering,''
according to
the report, which cites the growing reliance of US infrastructure
on computer
networks that may be vulnerable to attack by adversaries.
Similarly,
''asymmetric warfare'' - efforts by adversaries to circumvent or
minimise
hi-tech US strengths - will pose an increased threat to the United
States over
the 15 years. 
<P>
Another unknown is the sustainability of high levels of global
economic growth
in the coming years, according to the report, which cites a number
of
threats -
including a sustained downturn in the US economy; failure of
Europe, Japan,
China, and/or India to maintain healthy growth rates; and a major
new
financial
or energy crisis - could also derail more optimistic  scenarios. 
<P>
Adverse developments in the Middle East, China, Russia, Japan, and
India could
also disrupt more positive trends in the coming years, according
to the
report,
which notes that the dangerous mix of ethnic conflict in all of
these
countries, except Japan, and the existence there of well-armed
military
establishments could prove combustible. 
<P>
Among the great challenges facing the world over the next 15
years, however,
will be related to globalisation and its impact on population and
the
environment, according to the report. 
<P>
Demographically, wealthy countries will see tensions arising from
the growing
proportion of their retired populations, a trend which will result
in
inter-generational tensions and possibly in increased reliance on
migrant
workers. At the same time, ''youth bulges'' in poorer developing
countries,
especially in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, could
become
increasingly de-stabilising, especially given anticipated high
levels of
unemployment or communal tensions. 
<P>
Urbanisation and cross-migration will also continue to grow over
the next 15
years, while the HIV/AIDS crisis, as well as other infectious
diseases
plaguing
poor countries, will spread from their African epicentre at the
moment to
India, Southeast Asia, several countries of the former Soviet
Union, and possibly China. 
<P>
Water and food shortages, despite advancements in bio-technology,
could also
prove major problems for poorer, or drought-stricken countries.
The number of
chronically malnourished people in sub-Saharan Africa, for
example, will
likely
increase by more than 20 percent by 2015; while the chances for
war to break
out over competition for water resources is certain to rise,
particularly in
the Near East area. 
<P>
Demand for energy, including oil and other sources which
contribute to global
warming, is expected to increase by 50 percent over the next 15
years, making
it unlikely that the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse emissions
will take
effect.  
<P>
China, and to a lesser extent India, will see sharp increases in
energy
consumption, while the world oil and gas market will break down
into
essentially two different hemispheric sections: resources from
Central Asia -
which is vulnerable to regional-power competition and communal and
religious
conflict - and the Gulf will go mainly to East Asia, while western
Europe and
the Americas will rely increasingly on the Atlantic basin, from
the North Sea
to West Africa to Venezuela and Mexico. 
<P>
Each of the developing-country regions is certain to experience
serious
stresses resulting from uneven economic development - ''both
between and
within
states'', according to the report. 
<P>
In East Asia, Japan, Korea, and other economic ''tigers'' will
tend to get
richer, while Indochina, parts of western China, and possibly
Indonesia, will
tend to fall behind. Nationalism is likely to be a stronger force
in the
region
which could see the rise or revival of great-power rivalries, such
as
US-China,
China-Japan, and China-India, as well as power realignments
resulting from
political instability, such as in Indonesia, North Korea, and
possibly China. 
<P>
In South Asia, the dominant regional trend will be ''the widening
strategic
and
economic gaps between India and Pakistan,'' while Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, and
Nepal will become steadily more dependent on India. 
<P>
In Eurasia, ''the centrality of Russia will continue to diminish''
and the
weak
successor-states of the former Soviet Union, many of which already
are torn by
communal conflicts, will be subject to increased competition from
the
surrounding powers. 
<P>
The Middle East and North Africa are likely to remain relatively
insulated
from globalisation but without any more unity than exists today.
By 2015,
Israel will have attained a ''cold peace'' with its neighbours,
including a
Palestinian state, but demographic trends throughout the region
could
result in
''significantly larger, poorer, more urban, and more
disillusioned''
populations. 
<P>
Apart from South Africa and the oil-exporting countries of West
Africa, the
outlook for most of sub-Saharan Africa is ''bleak,'' according to
the report.
South Africa and Nigeria will remain the dominant powers, but
their own
domestic problems will make it difficult for them to act as
economic
locomotives for the rest of the region. 
<P>
Meanwhile, ''the atrophy of special relationships between European
powers and
their former colonies in Africa will be virtually complete by
2015'' and the
resulting void will be filled by ''international organisations and
non-state
actors of all types: transnational religious institutions,
international
non-profit organisations, international crime syndicates and drug
traffickers,
foreign mercenaries; and international terrorists seeking safe-
havens.'' 
<P>
In Latin America, Brazil and Mexico ''will be increasingly
confident and
capable actors'', but the gap between them, along with other
relatively
prosperous states in the southern cone, and the rest of the region
will widen.
Threats to stability and democratic government will be greatest in
the Andes
region, as well as the poorer countries in Central America,
according to the
report. The result will be the steady increase in migration from
those regions
to the United States.
