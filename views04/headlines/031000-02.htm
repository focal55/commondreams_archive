<p>Pollutants that waft from major industries are stifling
precipitation in many regions of the world, in some cases eliminating
almost all rain and snow produced by clouds, according to a new,
multinational study by atmospheric scientists published today.
<p>For decades, scientists have debated whether urban air pollution can
alter a region's rainfall. The new study, for the first time, seems to
provide direct evidence that tiny particles in industrial pollution cause
physical changes in clouds that prevent water from condensing into
raindrops and snowflakes,
<p>Daniel Rosenfeld, an atmospheric scientist at Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, said his research "shows unambiguously that air pollution can
shut off precipitation completely from certain types of clouds." The
results, reported in the journal Science, "might indicate that human
activity may be altering clouds and natural precipitation on a global
scale," he said.
<p>Because numerous factors can influence precipitation, documenting
pollution's effect on overall rainfall levels remains difficult. But
Rosenfeld said he has shown that weather changes can spread hundreds of
miles downwind of a large industry's plume of pollution.
<p>The scientist tracked pollutants from a coal-burning power plant in
remote Australia, factories in Turkey and a smelter in Canada.
<p>Many questions remain about how pollution affects rain and snow around
the globe, especially because some previous studies have indicated that
it might have the opposite effect of increasing rainfall. But Owen Toon,
a University of Colorado scientist, wrote in an accompanying article in
Science that the pollution plumes in the study will "serve as a Rosetta
stone for the potential impact" in more urbanized and industrialized
areas, where pollution sources are ubiquitous.
<p>In the study, satellite images were used for the first time to
simultaneously track pollution and measure the precipitation and
structure of clouds over large expanses of sky. In the past, scientists
used airplanes to probe individual clouds.
<p>Rosenfeld reported that it is a physical process, rather than a
chemical one, that blocks formation of rain and snow. Industrial plants
spew particles, formed by fuel combustion, that are much smaller than the
water droplets normally found in clouds.
<p>The small pollution particles inhibit the cloud's water droplets from
coalescing into larger drops to create rain. Smaller water droplets are
also slower to freeze, reducing the ice particles in clouds.
<p>In types of clouds that are short-lived, the lack of larger droplets
reduces or even eliminates precipitation, the report says.
<p>"Since the 1970s, people have been looking for the smoking gun to back
up this theory, and it sounds like he may have found it," said Stephen E.
Schwartz, an atmospheric scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York. "It sounds like [Rosenfeld] has a nice, clean case."
<p>Experts do not know what, if any, impact pollution is having on rain
and snow in the United States or other urbanized countries, where most
clouds are polluted to some degree. If there is an impact, it could have
serious consequences in Southern California, where the air contains high
levels of particulate pollution, and water derived from rain and snow is
scarce.
<p>In the Los Angeles area, the types of clouds likely to be altered by
pollution are ones of "modest depth," Rosenfeld said, "that come from the
west in typical winter days characterized by intermittent, moderate rain
showers."
<p>Rosenfeld said he cannot speculate on what his findings may mean for
areas like California, where there are no large smelters or coal-burning
plants. But he said: "It does not take a very large level of pollution,
by health standards, to affect the clouds to producing smaller droplets."
<p>The tiny size of the particles in the pollution seems to be the most
important factor in inhibiting rain and snow. Most of the fine particles
in the Los Angeles region's air come from trucks and cars, not heavy
industries.
<p>The most striking plumes of pollution in the study were in southern
Australia, home to the world's largest lead smelter, mineral-processing
plants and a large coal-burning power plant. The pollutants there were
easy to track because the area has fairly pristine, blue skies. Rosenfeld
found that polluted clouds were producing hardly any raindrops and ice
crystals, while unpolluted clouds did produce them.
<p>Scientists have long speculated about the impact of urban and
industrial air pollution on rainfall and snow patterns. Some had thought
particle pollution inhibits precipitation, similar to what happens with
smoke from forest fires. But some scientists recently have reported the
opposite--increased rainfall--downwind of some paper mills and over some
urban areas.
<p>Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, an atmospheric chemist at UC Irvine, was
surprised by Rosenfeld's findings. She said nearly all evidence recently
has indicated that pollution from ships and other sources could increase
precipitation.
<p>The new study differs, though, because it actually tracked pollutants
and studied clouds over large areas.
<p>If pollution is actually stifling rainfall, why have scientists
studying specific areas been unable to document any correlations between
urban pollution and overall precipitation? Rosenfeld said it may be
because urban areas are inflicting other changes in clouds, too, that
could offset the effects of pollution. For example, a power plant
generates heat that could make clouds grow larger in the immediate area
than they would naturally.
<p>"There are a lot of subtleties responsible for whether we get rain or
not," Schwartz said.
<p>Rosenfeld said the rain-reducing effects of pollutants are often
strongest many miles downwind of industries, so it has been difficult to
pinpoint a cause and effect.
<p>"At least now," with the new satellite images, he said, "we have
evidence that pollution can suppress precipitation." The next step, he
said, is quantifying how big of an effect the pollution is having.
<p>Environmental regulators, especially in California, have recently
begun focusing on cleaning up particle pollution, which in the Los
Angeles Basin comes largely from diesel vehicles. The push for new
regulations, which has been controversial because of the high cost, has
been driven by concerns about lung disease and public health, not
weather.
