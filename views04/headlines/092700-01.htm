UNITED NATIONS  - The 10-year-old UN embargo on Iraq,
which has devastated that country's economy and caused the deaths
of hundreds of children, is threatening to unravel. 
<P>
France and Russia, two veto-wielding permanent members of the
Security Council, have challenged the embargo arguing that it does
not apply to civilian flights carrying humanitarian aid.

</TABLE></font>Both Russian and French planes have, over the weekend, flown to
Iraq carrying not only doctors and medical supplies but also
business executives and soccer players. But the United States and
Britain, also permanent members of the Council, insist that these
flights are a violation of the embargo which was imposed on Iraq
just after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. 
<P>
China, the fifth veto-wielding member of the Council, has
expressed its strong opposition to the continued sanctions on
Iraq, but has not given any indication of ferrying relief supplies
to Baghdad. 
<P>
India, which has signed an economic co-operation agreement with
Iraq, has indicated it will probably follow the French and the
Russians with its own humanitarian flight into Baghdad. Jordan and
Syria may be next in line. 
<P>
The United States and Britain maintain that all flights into Iraq
have to be authorised by the UN Sanctions Committee which has, on
previous occasions, approved civilian flights, including flights
out of Baghdad for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.  
<P>
According to a news report from Baghdad, the Russians informed the
committee of its proposed flight but did not seek permission to
land in Iraq. The government of France, on the other hand, also
notified the committee but did not wait for approval. 
<P>
UN spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters that the United States
and Britain had asked for a delay in the departure of the flight
from Paris ''pending more information on the exact humanitarian
nature of the flight.'' But the plane departed Paris without
having received the committee's approval, Eckhard added. 
<P>
Britain and the United States interpret this as a clear violation
of the embargo. 
<P>
Addressing reporters at the United Nations two weeks ago, US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pointed out that it was very
hard to figure out what ''humanitarian'' means these days. ''The
United States disagreed with those who wished to fly into Iraq,''
she warned. 
<P>
Early this year, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the
humanitarian crisis in Iraq - where hundreds of children have been
dying of ill-health and malnutrition - posed ''a serious moral
dilemma for the United Nations.'' 
<P>
''The UN has always been on the side of the vulnerable and the
weak, and has always sought to relieve suffering,'' he told the
Security Council, ''Yet we are accused of causing suffering to an
entire population.''  
<P>
Annan said the United Nations was in danger of losing the argument
or the propaganda war - ''if we haven't already lost it'' - about
who is responsible for this situation. ''Is it (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein or the United Nations?'' he asked. 
<P>
The Secretary-General said he was particularly concerned about the
situation of Iraqi children whose suffering and, in all too many
cases, untimely deaths, were documented in a report prepared by
the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Iraqi Health Ministry last
year. ''We cannot in all conscience ignore such reports, and
assume that they are wrong,'' he told the Council. 
<P>
As a result of the human suffering in Iraq, the world body decided
to set up an ''oil for food'' programme about three years ago. 
<P>
Under this programme, Iraq is permitted to export limited
quantities of petroleum in order to finance food, medicine and
relief supplies - all of which were intended to alleviate the
impact of sanctions on the Iraqi people. But the United States has
said that even this programme is being abused by the Iraqi
government. 
<P>
Albright told reporters that the Iraqis will be pumping between 16
billion and 20 billion dollars'worth of oil this year. ''They were
also importing 12,000 cases per month of scotch whisky,'' she
charged. 
<P>
She said she was not sure if this was food or medicine, but it was
proof that there was plenty of money for President Saddam Hussein
to provide for his people. ''The elite was living very well,'' she
added. 
<P>
Albright said the United States would not agree to lift sanctions
until Iraq was relieved of all its weapons of mass destruction and
deprived of the military capability to produce such weapons in the
future. 
<P>
''Saddam Hussein was not invented. He had crossed an international
boundary, invaded another country, raped and pillaged and helped
destroy the way that country operated,'' she added. 
<P>
''He had lied about the fact that he had weapons of mass
destruction. He had prevented the United Nations (arms) inspectors
from entering Iraq. He had refused to abide by the will of the
international community. This was not an issue that was based on
her tenure. It was one that was American policy,'' Albright
asserted. 
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the 15-member European Union (EU), French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told a UN news conference early
this month that France continued to believe that the UN embargo on
Iraq should be lifted. 
<P>
But action on this, he pointed out, should be taken within the
framework of Security Council resolutions which ensured the
security of countries neighbouring Iraq. 
<P>
''France believed that the sanctions had become primitive,
outdated and economically absurd,'' he added. 
<P>
However, that was not a view shared by all 15 countries of the EU,
and it appeared that Iraq was still not prepared to accept the
provisions of UN resolutions, he added.
