UNITED NATIONS  - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said on Monday the threat of nuclear war ``remains a very real,
and very terrifying possibility'' at the beginning of the 21st
century.
<p>Without mentioning Washington by name, he also cautioned
against plans to develop a ``star wars''-type National Missile
Defense (NMD), saying this could lead to a new arms race.<p>Annan was welcoming delegates at the start of a month-long
conference to review implementation of the key Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).<p>Under the treaty, which entered into force in 1970, the five
original nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, Britain,
China and France -- are permitted to retain their nuclear
weapons in exchange for a pledge to move toward nuclear
disarmament.<p>The other 182 parties to the treaty have renounced any
ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons, while being assured access
to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.<p>But their resentment at what they regard as the big powers'
foot-dragging on disarmament will be highlighted during the
conference, held every five years.<p>Another focus is likely to be the four countries that have
so far refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
They are India and Pakistan, which carried out tit-for-tat
underground tests in 1998; Cuba; and Israel, certain to be
targeted by Arab states as possessing nuclear weapons.
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="3">Tests By India And Pakistan</font></b></font>
<p>Annan said the tests carried out by India and Pakistan were
''a serious setback against the global norms against nuclear
testing and nuclear proliferation.''<p>Welcoming what he called ``an unmistakable record of
achievement and hard-won progress'' in the disarmament field,
Annan said this was ``no time for complacency when it comes to
the threat of nuclear war.''<p>``Nuclear conflict remains a very real, and very terrifying
possibility at the beginning of the 21st century. This is the
stark reality confronting you today,'' Annan said.<p>Apparently alluding to weapons searches in Iraq after the
Gulf war, he added: ``We need look no further than the discovery
of clandestine nuclear-weapons development programs to realize
the magnitude of this (non-proliferation) challenge.''<p>Annan said the most recent challenge in the area of nuclear
disarmament was ``the growing pressure to deploy national
missile defenses.''<p>``This pressure is jeopardizing the ABM (anti-ballistic
missile) Treaty ... and could well lead to a new arms race,
setbacks for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and
create new incentives for missile proliferation,'' he said.<p>``It is my hope that all states will take great care to
weigh these dangers and challenges before embarking on a process
which may well reduce, rather than enhance, global security,''
Annan said.
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="3">Russia, China Warn On Changes In Abm Treaty</font></b></font>
<p>Russia and China have repeatedly said any tampering with the
1972 ABM treaty would destroy the entire edifice of nuclear
disarmament. The treaty is based on the theory that anti-missile
systems would only tempt the other side to build more missiles
to overwhelm the defenses.<p>Washington is to decide this summer whether to move ahead
with a limited defense against missiles launched by what it
regards as ``rogue states'' or terrorists.<p>Annan said that, on the positive side, former nuclear rivals
were ``now cooperating to reduce threats posed by their
weapons;'' nuclear safeguards had been strengthened; and
membership in nuclear-weapon-free zones in several parts of the
world had grown.<p>A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty had been negotiated, Annan
said, though it was not yet in force, and this month the Russian
Parliament had ratified the START II (Strategic Arms Reduction)
Treaty and the test ban treaty.<p>START II, reducing nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more
than 3,500 on each side by 2007, was ratified by the U.S. Senate
in 1996. But the Senate's rejection last October of the test ban
treaty, against the wishes of President Clinton, is certain to
provide ammunition for Washington's critics during the
conference.<p>Citing ``major challenges in fulfilling the disarmament
aims'' of the non-proliferation treaty, Annan said: ``Some
35,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nuclear
powers, with thousands still deployed on hair-trigger alert.''<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, among the first
speakers on Monday afternoon, intends to defend the extent of
U.S. disarmament since the end of the Cold War.
