<p>Riots erupted in Prague yesterday as thousands of anti-globalisation protesters attacked police with Molotov cocktails, cobbles and paving slabs ripped from the streets. Cars were set alight, and a dense fog of tear gas hung over parts of the city.

</TABLE></font>The annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, which protestors had vowed to blockade, went ahead. 
<p>
But 14,000 delegates and staff, bussed in at 5am to avoid the protests, were stranded inside the conference centre. Some were reportedly smuggled out of the building on an underground train. Only 5,000 protesters turned up, well short of the 20,000 predicted, but they were enough to turn areas of Prague into a battleground. 
<p>
Terrified residents watched as the police used water cannon, tear gas and percussion grenades. Repeatedly, armed riot officers charged the protesters, driving them further from the site of the IMF and World Bank meetings.
<p>
At least 69 people were injured, said police. They included 51 officers, several burned by a Molotov cocktail. One protester was knocked unconscious by a cobblestone. Demonstrators said another of their number was severely beaten by police. 
<p>
All access roads to the conference roads were closed to traffic. In a massive operation across the city, 11,000 police successfully blocked most of the protesters from the conference centre. 
<p>
But infuriated demonstrators brandishing wooden clubs attacked the police, at one point tearing an iron gate from its hinges to hurl at them.
<p>
The violence followed repeated pledges by campaigners that their demonstrations would be non-violent. Independent witnesses said the worst violence was initiated by the protestors.
<p>
Three separate marches set off from the central Peace Square in the morning. Their aim was to surround the congress centre from different sides, and blockade it until delegates agreed to dissolve the IMF and World Bank. Some activists hoped to break in and disrupt the meetings.
<p>
The most trouble was expected from the Italian Ya Basta group, who marched with a vanguard of heavily padded activists, equipped to break a police line. 
<p>
But officers were ready for them, and used several tanks to block a motorway bridge the marchers planned to cross. Ya Basta tried to force their way through, but failed. At one point the battle for the bridge turned surreal as Ya Basta threw coloured balloons at police, who popped them.
<p>
But the trouble came from a group of anarchists marching to the congress centre by a different route, across the floor of the valley below. When they found their path blocked, they attacked police.
<p>
The protesters had brought their wrath to the streets of Prague three days late. 
<p>
The men who make the real decisions in the IMF and World Bank, the finance ministers of the G7 group of industrialised nations, who met here on Saturday, had flown safely home long before violence started.
