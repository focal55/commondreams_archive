The thick ice that has for ages 
covered the Arctic Ocean at the 
pole has turned to water, recent 
visitors there reported yesterday. 
At least for the time being, an ice-free patch of ocean about a mile 
wide has opened at the very top of 
the world, something that has 
presumably never before been 
seen by humans and is more evidence that global warming may 
be real and already affecting climate.

<p> The last time scientists can be 
certain the pole was awash in 
water was more than 50 million 
years ago.

<p> "It was totally unexpected," 
said Dr. James J. McCarthy, an 
oceanographer, director of the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology 
at Harvard University and the co-leader of a group working for the 
 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sponsored 
by the United Nations. The panel 
is studying the potential environmental and economic consequences of marked climate 
change.

<p> Dr. McCarthy was a lecturer on 
a tourist cruise in the Arctic 
aboard a Russian icebreaker earlier this month. On a similar 
cruise six years ago, he recalled, 
the icebreaker plowed through an 
icecap six to nine feet thick at the 
North Pole.

<p> This time, ice was generally so 
thin that sunlight could penetrate 
and support concentrations of 
plankton growing under the ice. 
Dr. McCarthy said the icebreaker's Russian captain, who has 
made the voyage 10 times in recent years, said he had never 
before encountered open water at 
the pole.

<p> Another lecturer, Dr. Malcolm 
C. McKenna, a paleontologist at 
the American Museum of Natural 
History, said the ship, the Yamal, 
crunched through miles of unusually thin ice and intermittent open 
water on the approach from Spitsbergen, Norway, to the pole. When 
the ship reached the pole -- which 
Dr. McKenna and his wife, Priscilla, confirmed with a hand-held 
Global Positioning System  Priscilla, confirmed with a hand-held 
Global Positioning System  navigation device -- water lapped its 
bow.

<p> "I don't know if anybody in 
history ever got to 90 degrees 
north to be greeted by water, not 
ice," Dr. McKenna said in an interview. He instantly snapped pictures to document the phenomenon in photographs.

<p> The Yamal eventually had to 
steam six miles away to find ice 
thick enough for the 100 passengers to get out and be able to say 
they had stood on the North Pole, 
or close to it. They saw ivory gulls 
flying overhead, the first time ornithologists said they had ever 
been sighted at the pole.

<p>    Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the 
globe has risen by about 1 degree 
Fahrenheit, and the rate of warming has accelerated in the last 
quarter century. (That's a significant amount, considering that the 
world is only 5 to 9 degrees warmer 
now than it was in the last ice age, 
18,000 to 20,000 years ago.) Scientists 
and policy makers are still arguing 
about whether this is a natural fluctuation or an effect of industrial society's releasing heat-trapping gasses 
into the atmosphere.

<p> "Some folks who pooh-pooh global 
warming might wake up if shown 
that even the pole is beginning to 
melt at least sometimes, as in the 
Eocene," Dr. McKenna added.

<p> The Eocene was the geological period when the world's climate grew 
significantly warmer. Around 55 million years ago, according to sedimentary and fossil evidence, tropical 
vegetation spread inside the Arctic 
and Antarctic circles. Water and jungles dominated the polar environments, and in the generally warm 
world, mammals for the first time 
grew in number, size and diversity.

<p> Previous studies of satellite and 
submarine observations have 
seemed to establish a warming trend 
in the northern polar region and 
raise the possibility of a melting icecap.

<p> Scientists at the Goddard Space 
Science Institute, a NASA research 
center in Manhattan, compared data 
from submarines in the 1950's and 
60's with 90's observations, demonstrating that the ice cover over the 
entire Arctic basin has thinned by 45 
percent. Satellite images have revealed that the extent of ice coverage 
has significantly shrunk in recent 
years.

<p> Dr. McCarthy said he would report 
the encounter with open polar water 
to environmental scientists and consult other scientists to see if new 
satellite remote-sensing data have 
detected the extent of the melting.

<p> Recalling the reaction of passengers when they saw an iceless North 
Pole, he said: "There was a sense of 
alarm. Global warming was real, 
and we were seeing its effects for the 
first time that far north."

<p> In their models of climate patterns, scientists have long suggested 
that the northern polar region would 
be affected earlier and more seriously than the southern region.

<p> They said the greater expanse of 
land in the northern hemisphere 
should respond more rapidly to temperature change, presumably leading to marked climate change.
