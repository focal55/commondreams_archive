The massive U.S.-backed anti-drug offensive in Colombia is hitting
major funding roadblocks, with European countries refusing to ante up
more than $2 billion, and the Colombians themselves unsure they have the
means to put up an additional $4 billion.
<p>The reluctance of international donors, and the seeming inability of
the Colombians, to fund the $7.5-billion aid effort "leaves the Americans
stepping up to the plate and everybody else walking away from it," said a
senior Clinton administration official who requested anonymity for fear
of endangering sensitive diplomatic relationships.
<p>If the Colombians and others don't come up with the money soon, the
ambitious program could be limited to $1.3 billion in largely military
assistance from the U.S., which administration officials say cannot put
more than a dent in the country's powerful drug trade.
<p>The U.S. aid, approved by Congress in June, is the centerpiece of a
broader plan to fight the drug scourge in a country that is the source of
90% of the cocaine sold on U.S. streets. It is more money than the U.S.
has invested in a Latin American military effort since the Central
American conflicts of the 1980s.
<p>But the effort, dubbed "Plan Colombia" by Colombian President Andres
Pastrana, also would rely heavily on European and Colombian money to fund
much of what a Clinton administration official calls its "soft
side"--programs to help refugees, bolster the administration of justice
and human rights, and find ways for peasants to make a living without
joining guerrilla forces or planting illicit crops. The U.S. contribution
includes $238 million for that effort, a small percentage of the total
U.S. package but a tenfold increase in the money now being spent by the
U.S. on such programs in Colombia.
<p>Many of the intended recipients of the money--among them the
International Committee of the Red Cross, World Vision and 36 other aid
groups with programs in Colombia--have balked at accepting it. They say
they have doubts that the plan can work and are concerned that their
employees in Colombia will be targeted by rebels and drug traffickers if
they are associated with it.
<p>Officials of the Red Cross and other aid groups brought those concerns
to a meeting in Geneva in late September with Julia Taft, head of the
State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, said
Daniel Augstburger, deputy head of the Red Cross operation in North
America.
<p>"The groups are mainly concerned about the direction of the plan, also
about the security of their people." said Robin Kirk, Colombia researcher
for Human Rights Watch. "People see it as a cosmetic maneuver that the
U.S. has made to convert an essentially military operation into something
that's more palatable."
<p>It has been unclear from the plan's inception how Colombia would come
up with the $4 billion Pastrana pledged to the effort. The Colombian
economy is in shambles, with unemployment topping 20%.
<p>To date, the Colombian congress has voted to allocate just $15 million
to the plan. While more is said to be in the pipeline, the congress is
now largely out of Pastrana's control, and more than half the nation's
territory is in the hands of insurgents and drug traffickers. It appears
increasingly unlikely that Colombia's portion of the funding will
approach Pastrana's promise.
<p>As for the proposed European contributions, they have never been
certain. Neither the Colombians nor the Clinton administration has gotten
assurances of money from individual European countries or the European
Union. Many European leaders have openly expressed skepticism about a
plan they complain relies too heavily on military means, and on
cooperation with Colombian security forces with questionable human rights
records.
<p>Nevertheless, Clinton administration officials had been confident that
once the U.S. committed itself, the Europeans would follow suit. More
than a third of the cocaine produced in Colombia goes to Europe.
<p>But only Spain, with $100 million, Norway, with $20 million, and
Japan, with $70 million in loans, have pledged funds. The European Union
has made no commitment to the plan at all. The United Nations has pledged
$131 million, and international financial institutions say they will
grant loans of up to $300 million.
<p>"The attitude of the Europeans on this is really discouraging," the
senior administration official said. "The way this thing was designed,
the U.S. money was to fund the military component, and the Europeans were
going to come up with more of the economic and social support funds.
That's an important component, because you need to give people legitimate
alternatives to drug trafficking to make them think twice before joining
up with the guerrillas or the traffickers."
<p>The Colombian government is inviting European representatives to a
meeting in Bogota, the capital, on Oct. 24 at which Pastrana's government
will make another pitch.
<p>"In order to do what Europe wants and what we want, we need to have
the funds," said Jaime Ruiz, Pastrana's top advisor on drug policy.
<p>While the Colombians and their Clinton administration advisors have
established no deadline for securing European donations, administration
officials acknowledge that time is running short. Pastrana's term ends in
2002, and there is no assurance that his successor will be equally
committed to the plan.
<p>Administration officials had hoped to have many of the plan's programs
up and running by early next year to give them the chance to prove their
effectiveness before power changes hands in Colombia.
<p>"There is going to be considerably more work to do after 2002. It will
have to become more of a state program that carries over into the next
administration," said a State Department official who helps manage
humanitarian programs in Colombia. "We'd very much like to see some
European contributions by early next year."
<p>The most recent statement from a European official, British Cabinet
Office Minister Marjorie "Mo" Mowlam, was not optimistic.
<p>"For us to feel easy about putting more money in social and economic
programs, we need to see more progress" on human rights, Mowlam said last
month after leading a high-level delegation to Colombia.
<p>Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, said that without help from the Europeans, "Plan
Colombia" is in trouble.
<p>"For years, I have urged our European friends to help with the
emerging narco state in Colombia," Gilman said. "I was hopeful that with
the latest White House drug czar data showing that up to one-third of the
cocaine from Colombia is now going to Europe, that they would finally do
their share."
