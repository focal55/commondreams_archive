<p>PHILADELPHIA -  Republican officials insist that their financial base is primarily small donors, but the party has received 
more than $90 million from a relatively small pool of wealthy individuals and corporations, some of whom 
have shielded their generosity from 
public view.

<p> An elite cadre of 739 contributors, 
writing larger checks than in the 
past, has provided two-thirds of the 
party's $137 million in so-called soft 
money, the unrestricted party gifts. 
Some donors have been directed by 
party officials to make their gifts in 
ways that disguise their identity and 
the degree of their largess, according to a top Republican fund-raiser.

<p> The party's platinum-level sponsors are the Republican Regents, a 
group of 139 people and corporations 
that party officials say have each 
given at least $250,000 in soft money 
since January 1999. Two-thirds of the 
Regents are individuals, the rest are 
corporations. According to Federal 
Election Commission records, the select membership includes Lawrence 
Kadish, a New York real estate developer; Kenneth W. Lay, the chairman of Enron Corporation; Jerrold 
Perenchio, the chairman of the Univision television network; and Alex 
Spanos, a developer and investor 
based in Stockton, Calif.

<p> But Federal Election Commission 
records show only 54 corporations 
and individuals as having given the 
large donations to the party because 
some donors have split them into 
smaller checks, at the suggestion of 
party officials. That effectively 
makes the donors' contribution totals harder to trace.

<p> Some donors have also written 
checks to state party committees, 
whose records are not filed with the 
Federal Election Commission and 
are hard to obtain. Several party 
fund-raisers acknowledged that 
some donors have been told by finance officials to make contributions 
in the name of more obscure corporate subsidiaries that cannot always 
be easily linked to individuals.

<p> Bill Pascoe, the Republican Party 
press secretary, said he was not 
aware of a deliberate plan to direct 
large contributors to send checks to 
state party committees as a way of 
disguising the size of their gifts.

<p> But fund-raisers said big-dollar donors were willing to write numerous 
checks to different party committees 
to try to preserve their privacy. 
Some have even asked for suggestions from party officials for ways to 
disguise  their contribution levels.

<p>       "It's broken up," said a longtime 
Republican fund-raiser who declined 
to be named. "A man gives some, a 
spouse gives, an investment company gives, a subsidiary gives. People 
want anonymity. The party doesn't 
care; they're getting their money."

<p> Behind closed doors here this 
week, the Regents are getting suitably royal treatment.

<p> At 4 p.m. on Monday, Tiffany & 
Company closed early so it could 
hold a private reception for 200  Regents and their spouses. They sipped 
soup from mock Faberg&#0233; eggs as a 
string quartet played. Joan Specter, 
the wife of  Senator Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania,  designed the table arrangements, which included rare orange Gerber daisies and matching 
roses. Each Regent was given a 
trademark blue Tiffany box containing a crystal bowl, inscribed with 
George W. Bush's signature.

<p> Some Regents played golf this 
morning with Republican elected officials and former cabinet members 
at the White Marsh Valley Country 
Club in Lafayette Hills, Pa.

<p> These events have been strictly off 
limits to reporters, and credentials 
are carefully checked at the door. 
Several Regents asked the Republican National Committee to send extra party workers to guard their 
events from the media. (Party officials refused,  suggesting the club 
hire its own security guards.)

<p>Party officials declined to disclose 
the Regents' membership list or a 
complete convention agenda, but The 
New York Times obtained a carefully guarded list of the Regents' Philadelphia itinerary from a member. On 
the calendar, the events are listed 
"REGENTS ONLY."

<p> In previous years, the donor elite 
was Team 100, a group of $100,000 
contributors that began in 1988 to 
help elect President George Bush. 
The club, now dedicated to the election of his son George W., the governor of Texas, has grown to 600 members and accounts for more than $60 
million of the party's $137 million  in 
soft money. In Philadelphia, some 
Team 100 members have complained that their events are too 
crowded. One Regent crowed that 
Team 100 members were packed like 
sardines in their party suite, while 
the $250,000 club members had 
"room to stretch our legs."

<p> "You pay a little more, you get a 
little more," Mel Sembler,  finance 
chairman of the Republican National 
Committee, said the other day.

<p> Party officials said that while they 
were grateful for the support of big 
donors, the core of the party was its 
600,000 small contributors, whose  average donation  is $99.63, they said.

<p> "We are the party of small donors 
who represent grass-roots America," said Jim Nicholson, the party 
chairman. "We're pleased with the 
outpouring of support we've seen in 
recent weeks, particularly since 
Governor Bush announced his selection of Dick Cheney."

<p> Some of the party's biggest donors 
have also written large checks to 
state Republican Party chapters. 
For example, 17 top donors to the 
national party also appear as donors 
to the Indiana party, according to the 
National Institute on Money in State 
Politics. Sam Fox, the chairman of 
the Harbour Group, a Missouri manufacturing company, and the party's 
largest individual donor, is credited 
in state records  with having given 
the Indiana party $275,000. But Mr. 
Fox said in an interview today that 
he had not written a check to the 
state party. A Republican National 
Committee official said he could not 
explain the discrepancy.

<p> The institute  found that 10 top national party contributors also gave a 
total of $367,000 to the New York 
party. A  fund-raiser said that contributors were given credit for contributions to state parties when determining their qualifications for the 
Regents and Team 100 clubs.

<p> Campaign finance experts  criticized the Republican Party today for 
what they said appeared to be efforts 
 to hide large contributions.

<p>  "This is an extraordinary development," said Fred Wertheimer, an 
advocate of revisions in federal campaign finance law  and the president 
of Democracy 21, a group that works 
toward that end. "These efforts to 
raise soft money secretly are an outrageous evasion of disclosure laws. 
Large soft-money contributions are 
disappearing underground."

<p>  Since March 1999, Governor Bush 
has raised $93.2 million in checks of 
$1,000 or less, much of it raised by a 
network of fund-raisers called the 
Pioneers. He has promptly listed his 
donors and the amounts they have 
contributed on his  Web  site.

<p>  "I have always supported rapid 
public disclosure of campaign contributions as a healthy campaign finance reform," Mr. Bush said in 
September.

<p> Mr. Sembler, a Florida shopping 
center magnate  and former ambassador to Australia, created the Regents last year,  coining the name. 

<p> "I thought it had a lofty sound to 
it," Mr. Sembler said in an interview 
earlier this year. But some Republicans do not like the name, saying it 
hardly hides the fact that a small 
donor group gets royal treatment 
from the party.
 This week's highlight event is a 
"Regents only" reception that precedes Wednesday's Republican gala 
lunch to be held at the Philadelphia 
Marriott. The Regents will get  to 
meet privately with Governor  Bush 
and his wife, Laura; Mr. Cheney; 
and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.

<p> When asked if he would allow a 
reporter to attend a Regents event, 
Mr. Sembler laughed. "Write me a 
$250,000 check," he said, "and I'll 
open the door for you."
