WASHINGTON -- It's not so odd that a graduate 
of the 80's with a master's 
degree in economics and 
some supply-side credentials 
should now find himself  negotiating a big merger.

<p> But in this case, the merger 
would combine Ozone Action and 
Greenpeace U.S.A., one of the 
more obscure and one of the 
more famous of environmental 
organizations. The buzzwords 
might be the same as in the 
world of corporate combinations 
-- "synergy" comes to mind -- 
but the objectives could not be 
more different.

</TABLE>
</font></font>Whether or not the merger 
succeeds (the two groups' 
boards are still thinking it over), 
John Passacantando, co-founder 
and executive director of Ozone 
Action, has agreed to move to 
Greenpeace U.S.A. as its executive director. At age 38, he will take charge of 
one of the best-known franchises in environmentalism after years of upheaval in the group. 
Greenpeace U.S.A.'s entire board resigned several months ago amid disputes over the group's 
internal organization, staffing and overall direction.

<p>  Greenpeace U.S.A.'s membership is  about 
300,000, down from the  million members it 
reported several years ago. It has a budget of 
about $20 million a year, raised mostly by 
costly direct mail. Its staff numbers about five 
dozen, after reductions under its former director, Kristen Engberg.

<p>   Ozone Action is built quite differently. It  has 
no members, but a network of a few thousand 
volunteers; its budget of $1.3 million comes 
mostly from family foundations, and its staff 
numbers about a dozen.

<p>  Both groups are based in Washington, but 
Greenpeace U.S.A. reports to Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. Ozone Action focuses narrowly on  pollution that causes global 
warming or  thins the earth's protective ozone 
layer. Greenpeace's agenda is much broader, 
taking in everything, including  saving whales 
and opposing genetically modified crops.

<p> But the groups share something important, 
Mr. Passacantando said: an appreciation for 
attention-grabbing theatrics, on the streets or 
on the high seas,  in support of their  policy 
objectives.

<p> And for this sincere son of the suburbs, the 
trip to the helm of Greenpeace U.S.A.'s  ship 
meant getting used to the ruckus-raising tactics 
known in the trade as "direct action."



<p> Usually, Ozone Action's events are moderate 
in tone, like bringing ambassadors from small 
island states to seashore town meetings on 
rising ocean levels from global warming, or 
building Web pages that use government data 
to illustrate  increases in heat waves. But a few 
months ago, Mr. Passacantando,  the president 
of Friends of the Earth and a few others were 
arrested at the headquarters of the World Bank 
in Washington during protests of the April 
meetings of the international monetary organizations. They tried to hang a banner denouncing 
energy development and to disrupt traffic with 
a disabled truck.

<p> "Somehow you can find a way that is outrageous and fun, but still fair and ethical, to 
speak the truth to power," he says of such 
tactics. "That's a fun job to go to every morning."

<p> He was not  always like this. Growing up 
in Whippany, N.J., the son of a father 
who sold insurance and a mother who 
left a research job to rear him and his younger 
brother and sister, Mr. Passacantando liked to 
camp, hike and fish with his dad but was not 
 preoccupied by the environment.

<p> "I was under the false conviction, well conveyed to me during the Reagan years, that the 
era of movements was over," he said. "I had 
missed the civil rights movement, and I 
thought, 'What a shame.' "

<p>   He sold computer systems, then was hired by 
Jude Wanniski's Polyconomics Inc. to sell economic research to Wall Street. "In fact, very 
conservative research, supply-side research," 
he recalled. "It was pro-development, without any regard for 
sustainability."   

<p> Meanwhile he got a master's 
degree in economics at New 
York University. But  his world 
view was starting to change.

<p> He was reading John Muir and 
Rachel Carson, the farmer-philosopher Wendell Berry and the 
eco-spiritualist Thomas Berry. 
And he became involved "as a 
minor player" in a local development dispute in Morristown, N.J.

<p> Then Bill Moyers, the head of 
the Florence and John Schumann Foundation in Montclair, 
N.J., who is the father of Mr. 
Passacantando's first wife, took 
him aboard with the assignment 
of encouraging  "a grass-roots 
renewal of democracy." 

<p> (His current wife works on 
environmental policy in the Clinton administration.)

<p> The work brought him into 
contact with environmental advocates, people 
like Michael Clark, who was building a coalition 
to protect the Yellowstone ecosystem, and Jeff 
DeBonis, who was organizing green-leaning 
professionals in the Forest Service. 

<p> "I saw that there was, after all, a movement 
of activists all over the country; it just did not 
get through the veil," he says. "There was a 
wonderful buzz in our democracy, which I had 
not been seeing, which I did not see in college. 
This is my generation's great battle, and I 
wanted to be in the trenches."

<p> In July 1993, he co-founded Ozone Action, 
taking the name from the crisis over the ozone 
hole caused by emissions of chlorofluorocarbons. His co-founder was Karen Lohr, a Greenpeace veteran.

<p> The two groups' styles still differ considerably. Ozone Action has been training 200 students 
to  report on corporate efforts to influence the 
global warming negotiations in The Hague. 

<p>Greenpeace, meanwhile, has been driving its 
boats obstreperously into the path of a test of a 
missile defense system.

<p>  But there is  no real culture gap, says Mr. 
Passacantando, who hopes his team will fit 
right in after a merger.

<p> "Greenpeace took what the American colonists did at the Tea Party and really did develop 
it to an art form," he said. "And what you have 
now is an organization that is stabilized, that 
came out of a steep fall for the last decade, and 
really wants its leadership to get its creative 
work going again."
