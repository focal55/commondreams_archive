<p>A scientific research expedition to the Mexican coast by 20 
University of California at Davis students, scholars and environmentalists 
turned tragic when one of their boats capsized, leaving at least three 
people dead and two missing.	 
</P>
<P> Authorities said yesterday that the research party was returning to the 
remote fishing village of Bahia de los Angeles late Monday when its 22-foot 
inflatable boat capsized off the coast of Baja California about 300 miles 
south of the U.S. border.	 
</P>
<P>  Four survivors clung to the overturned boat for two hours, then spent 
three hours swimming through swells reaching six feet before reaching two 
small islands late Monday. They were rescued yesterday.	 
</P>
<P>  UC Davis administrators identified one of the dead as Michael Rose, a 
28-year-old researcher at the university's Department of Environmental 
Science and Policy. He also was a project director for <a href="http://earthwatch.org/index.html">Earthwatch Institute</a>, 
an international environmental group that works closely with UC Davis 
researchers in Mexico.	 
</P>
<P>  University officials withheld the name of the second victim, a visiting 
Japanese scholar, pending notification of relatives. A third victim, whose 
name was not released, was found later yesterday.	 
</p>
SPIDER EXPERT MISSING
<P>  One of those missing was <a href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Polis/Polis.HTM">Gary Polis</a>, the 53-year-old chairman of the 
Department of Environmental Science and Policy. He is considered one of the 
world's foremost authorities on spiders. His work has appeared in forums 
ranging from national television to children's books, and Polis himself was 
the topic of the 1994 book ``Scorpion Man.''	 
</P>
<P>  ``He's a renowned expert in the field,'' said Dr. Charles Griswold of the 
California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. ``If he is lost, it will be 
a huge loss to the field.''	 
</P>
<P>  The identity the other person who remained missing was not released.	 
</P>
<P>  The researchers were returning to Bahia de los Angeles from Isla Cabeza 
de Caballo, where they were studying spiders and scorpions. They boarded two 
inflatable Zodiac boats at midday for the four-mile trip back to the Baja 
peninsula.	 
</p>
WAVES FILLED BOATS WITH WATER
<P>  Winds gusting to 30 mph churned the sea, kicking up four-
foot to six-foot swells that caused one of the boats to fill with water and 
capsize.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It all happened within a matter of minutes. There was a big wave every 
two minutes that pounded us,'' said survivor Gary Huxel, 38, a 
post-doctorate ecology researcher at Davis.	 
</P>
<P>  After clinging to the capsized vessel for two hours, Huxel and two others 
set off for shore with life jackets and seat cushions. Huxel said Polis was 
still hanging onto the boat when he swam off.	 
</P>
<P>  Those who left the boat were soon separated by the punishing waves; Huxel 
drifted to one nearby island while the others wound up on another.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It was a long, brutal swim,'' said Rob German, whose girlfriend, 
Rebecca Lawson, survived the ordeal and recounted it to him in a phone call 
yesterday. ``(Rebecca) was pretty beat up.''	 
</P>
<P>     The other rescued survivors are UC Davis students Sarah Ratay and 
Ralph Haygood. All were found sunburned and exhausted but otherwise 
uninjured.	 
</p>
SEARCH TO RESUME TODAY
<P>  Mexican naval authorities and the Coast Guard called off their search 
last night but planned to resume this morning..	 
</P>
<P>  ``It's impossible to speculate what has happened to them,'' said Shannon 
Knight, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. ``The good news is that they're young and 
probably healthy and could have possibly swum to land. The other good thing 
is the weather has been calm.''	 
</P>
<P>  Water temperatures in the area ranged from 60 to 65 degrees. An 
average-sized person could last up to eight hours in those conditions, Coast 
Guard officials said. A person with more body fat and in good health could 
last longer.	 
</P>
<P>  Friends and colleagues remained hopeful last night that the missing would 
turn up safely.	 
</P>
<P>  ``For all we know they could be holed up on an island somewhere,'' said 
Roger V.D. Bergen, president and CEO of Earthwatch Institute.	 
</P>
<P>  Six members of Earthwatch were on the ill-fated expedition but occupied 
the boat that made it back.	 
</p>
HELICOPTER SENT TO SEARCH
<P>  The Mexican Navy had been searching for Polis and two others since 
daybreak yesterday. A body was found later in the day but no identification 
was made public. A Coast Guard helicopter arrived at the scene from San 
Diego at about 4 p.m. to assist in finding the missing pair but returned to 
Southern California as darkness fell on the Sea of Cortez.	 
</P>
<P> Polis' work has appeared in publications such as Nature, Smithsonian 
Magazine, and National Geographic Explorer. He has been hailed by 
conservationists as ``a hero to the environment.''	 
</P>
<P>  He came to UC Davis two years ago from Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville, Tenn., where he taught from 1979 until 1998.	 
</P>
<P>  Colleagues called Polis a warm, outgoing man who loved cooking Italian 
meals. His fascination with scorpions began in 1972, when he spotted one of 
the venomous creatures during a camping trip in the Santa Monica Mountains.	 
</P>
<P>  Polis began his research in Baja in the late 1980s and travelled there 
three or four times a year, university officials said. This time the 
researchers concentrated on an island off the coast of Bahia de los Angeles, 
a tourist spot and popular destination for sports fishermen and wildlife 
biologists drawn by the region's rich array of wildlife.	 
</P>
<P>  Bahia de los Angeles is so remote the town has just one telephone and 
electrical service is shut off at 10 p.m. each night.	 
</P>
<P> Rose, who died in the mishap, had helped Polis in the laboratory and in 
the field. Colleagues said Rose enjoyed playing soccer and possessed a keen 
sense of humor.	 
</P>
<P>  ``He was a great guy to be around,'' said Paul Sabatier, vice chairman of 
the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at UC Davis.	 
</P>
<P>  Bergen said Rose had gone to Mexico early to prepare for the expedition 
because of his organizational skills.	 
</P>
<P> ``He was a very detail-oriented person,'' he said. ``We had tremendous 
confidence in him -- this is the last thing anybody would have thought would 
have happened. We just felt this guy had everything down pat.''
