<p>MADISON, Wis.--In an era when many students are heading for college to prepare for lucrative jobs in a booming economy, Hailey Fasse of Elgin has come to the University of Wisconsin looking for something else.
<P>"I was looking for activism," said the 18-year-old, snapping out the words as she stiffened in the damp chill on the steps of the school's ornately classical Bascom Hall administration building.
<P>She had been standing for almost two hours Monday evening with hundreds of students who gathered for the latest chapter in the most concerted student activism across the country in decades: protest against alleged sweatshop conditions in factories around the world that make apparel emblazoned with school logos.
<P>The movement has also seen protests at several other Big 10 universities and is drawing students from major Chicago campuses, including Northwestern and Loyola Universities and the University of Chicago.
<P>The scene in Madison recalled the 1960s, when the University of Wisconsin was a hotbed of student radicalism over the Vietnam war, culminating in the bombing of a university building in 1970 that killed a young physicist.
<P>But in this case the protest is against a more subtle, largely behind-the-scenes conflict.
<P> The students also denounced Chancellor David Ward for his reaction to a protest sit-in that led to about 50 arrests over the weekend.
<P>After most of the crowd had dispersed, Fasse remained with a few students, one wearing a sign reading "Jailed For Protesting Sweatshops." A seated statue of Abraham Lincoln was clad in a sackcloth vest bearing an anti-sweatshop slogan sprayed in red paint.
<P>For all of the '60s flavor, however, the Madison sit-in displayed elements that give the 2000 version of student protest a distinctive edge: tighter focus, more professionalism and a strong tinge of the Internet influence.
<P>Fasse had gotten her first taste of activism when she joined the sit-in at the chancellor's office that ended last weekend with police in riot gear arresting students who burst out with the civil-rights anthem "We Shall Overcome."
<P>The resurging campus ferment is gaining adherents in part because college logo apparel has sales estimated at $2.5 billion annually and brings in substantial sums--sometimes millions of dollars--to higher-education institutions, which get royalties for use of the logos.
<P>The student leaders say the movement includes chapters of a national organization called United Students Against Sweatshops on at least 200 college and university campuses across the nation.
<P>Unlike many 1960s protesters, who targeted the Vietnam War but often seemed filled with a generalized rage about U.S. society, many of today's demonstrators are homing in on a single issue with a laser intensity.
<P>"I think this issue on campuses is easy to relate to . . .," said Brendan O'Sullivan, a Wisconsin senior and one of the protest leaders. "It's sold in their shops . . . and they're wearing the logos. It's close to home, that what they're wearing is being produced in sweatshops."
<P>The leaders add that part of the energy of the protest comes from the high-tech world, as e-mails, Web sites and cell phones speed communication within and between campus groups.
<P>The students are demanding that the universities join a nascent student-founded group called the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), whose code calls for aggressive disclosure and monitoring of sweatshop locations in countries from Indonesia to the Dominican Republic, as well as the United States.
<P>The recent protests seemingly have met with some success, though not always enough to satisfy the students. Last week the University of Wisconsin joined the University of Michigan and Indiana University in agreeing to join the WRC on a provisional basis, pending clarification of the terms of membership.
<P>Indiana announced its agreement after negotiations with students but without any protest action. At the University of Michigan, students staged a three-day sit-in at a dean's office.
<P>At Wisconsin, however, militant students continued to occupy the offices of the chancellor, demanding a firmer commitment to the WRC and an apology for the use of pepper spray by campus police when the sit-in began Feb. 16.
<P>Just before dawn on Sunday, police in riot gear ordered the students out and, when most refused to go, police dragged them away, according to witnesses and media accounts. Some 54 students were jailed, but all were bailed out by Sunday night.
<P>The story spread like wildfire, and a volley of e-mails expressing outrage over the arrests hit the campus from students in schools all over the map.
<P>Meanwhile, the same speedy communication was churning through Northwestern's campus in Evanston, where students prompted by an e-mail account of the Wisconsin arrests shot off their own electronic missives to President Henry Bienen, asking him to contact Wisconsin's chancellor to urge him to drop charges against the arrested students. University spokesman Alan Cubbage said, "As a matter of professional courtesy, we don't tell other college administrations how to handle their affairs."
<P>The Wisconsin situation has galvanized the normally low-key Northwestern campus.
<P>Desiree Evans, a 19-year-old freshman journalism student from Lafayette, La., who was involved in the e-mail campaign, said several groups on campus, including a recently organized chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society--the long-dormant SDS of '60s notoriety--were planning to turn up the heat on the administration over the sweatshop issue.
<P>Cubbage said he hadn't heard of any student action yet and noted that the university is a member of the Fair Labor Association, a group that came out of a Clinton administration initiative on sweatshop issues in the mid-1990s.
<P>The United Students Against Sweatshops activists have been denouncing the FLA as toothless and are demanding that the schools abandon it for the WRC, which has detailed provisions for implementation and funding by member schools. Wisconsin and other schools have agreed to withdraw from the FLA.
<P>Elsewhere in the area, Loyola students at the Lake Shore campus on Monday sneaked into a closed-off part of a building called the Skyscraper on Sheridan Road and draped a banner from the 11th floor expressing support of the Wisconsin students. University of Chicago students said they were planning a similar action.
<P> DePaul students said that later in the week they will stage a "guerrilla theater" performance featuring a male student stripping off brand-name clothing while another student speaks about the connection between the brand and sweatshops.
<P>A recent study suggests the student activism should not come as a complete surprise.
<P> A survey of freshmen by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles reported that the proportion who had been involved in protests or demonstrations reached 45.9 percent in the last two years, the highest since the survey began in 1966.
