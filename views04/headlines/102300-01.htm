MARIN, CALIFORNIA --    Environmental waste has put the life support system of 
the planet on Red Alert, and ``human rights'' in the 21st century 
means the right to be born free of toxins, experts said over the 
weekend at a conference for environmental solutions.
<P>  ``If Thomas Jefferson were here today, he'd be calling for a Bill 
of Responsibilities,'' said environmental architect and designer 
William McDonough, who called for a new Industrial Revolution in 
which ecology, accountability and profit are siblings on equal 
footing in the global economy. ``When the Exxon Valdez spills, the 
(gross domestic product) of Alaska goes way up because everyone's at 
work on the cleanup. Our activity is not our legacy.''	 
</P>
<P>  The speeches were given at the 10th annual <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers</a> conference, 
held in San Rafael. The word bioneers means ``biological pioneers,'' 
and the yearly conference featured an eclectic group of speakers from 
around the country -- scientists, doctors, businesspeople, authors, 
academics and artists -- who subscribe to a ``Declaration of 
Interdependence'' that says humans 
and nature are inextricably linked. Over 2,000 attendees came to the 
Marin Center meeting.	 
</P>
<P>  McDonough, who won a presidential award for sustainable 
development, discussed projects such as developing ``infinitely 
recyclable'' polyester for Nike's running shoes and his current work 
on redesigning the Ford Motor Co. facility in Michigan. The Virginia 
resident also designed the Gap office complex in San Bruno, which is 
30 percent more energy efficient than California law requires.	 
</P>
<P>   Author Alice Walker said one of the nation's most critical 
restoration projects is creating a culture that respects elders and 
connects them with youth -- most likely through cyberspace. She told 
the audience it was time to grow up -- and that she didn't even hit 
her stride till her 50s.	 
</P>
<P>  ``By not growing up, we miss out on ever becoming adults,'' she 
said. ``Elders are a government soon to be in exile.''	 
</P>
<P>  The conference was founded by Santa Fe resident Kenny Ausubel in 
1990. ``One of the problems for the public with the environmental 
movement is the gloom and doom scenario,'' said Ausubel, who now runs 
<a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers</a> with his wife, Nina Simons. ``The conversation changes 
radically when people realize there are solutions.''	 
Many of those solutions were offered by presenters from the Bay Area, 
such as Dr. Michael Lerner of Bolinas' Commonweal, a health and 
environmental institute that has attracted attention for its 
innovative programs for cancer patients. Lerner spoke on his newest 
campaign, Health Care Without Harm, an organization working with 
hospitals to stop the incineration of medical waste containing dioxin 
and mercury. In four years, it has grown from 30 people to 300 member 
organizations in 30 countries.	 
</P>
<P>  ``We're living in an epidemic of chronic health problems (such as) 
cancer and learning disorders due to chemical exposure,'' said 
Lerner, who equated the right of a fetus to be born free of toxins to 
labor rights, civil rights and women's rights.	 
</P>
<P>   Although <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers</a> began in Santa Fe, it outgrew the city in its 
third year, and Ausubel and Simons moved the meeting to the Bay Area 
because of its progressive environmental community. Bioneers has 
evolved into a national public radio series, and Simon and Ausubel 
are also exploring the possibility of a TV show.	 
</P>
<P>  Bioneers was born out of Ausubel's work in the 1980s producing a 
documentary on Harry Hoxsey, a former coal miner who in the 1950s 
created the world's largest privately owned cancer clinic using 
herbal therapy, and his co-founding of Seeds of Change, the organic 
seed firm dedicated to ``backyard biodiversity.'' (Ausubel has since 
parted ways with the company.)	 
</P>
<P>  Ausubel and Simon both say they see the conference not just as a 
forum for eco-visionaries, but as a way for them to cross-pollinate. 
British biologist Dr. Mae-Wan Ho, for example, is collaborating with 
Chicago cancer prevention expert Dr. Samuel Epstein on a book on 
genetic engineering, after meeting at a previous Bioneers conference.	 
</P>
<P>   ``Part of the solution is in these ecological technologies,'' 
says Ausubel, ``But another part is a change of heart.'' In the hard 
drive of humanity, there is a fundamental systems error, says 
Ausubel, and that is ``thinking we're apart from -- rather than a 
part of -- nature.''	 
</P>
<P>  Among the most popular speakers were mycologist Paul Stamets of 
Washington state, who has done scientifically documented work 
breaking down hazardous waste with fungi, and the Body Shop's Anita 
Roddick, whose projects include sending employees of her cosmetics 
company to postwar Kosovo to help with rebuilding efforts.	 
</P>
<P>  About 60 percent of the people who came to Bioneers this year were 
from California, the rest from other parts of the United States and 
from around the globe. The crowd was diverse -- moms with babies and 
toddlers in tow; architects, activists, doctors and dot-commers; 
aging hippies clad in hemp. Law student Glen Banfield of Oregon came 
because he wanted to get ideas for an environmental justice 
conference he's organizing himself.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It makes no sense to blame anyone about the environment at this 
point,'' said Banfield. ``It's better to be proactive and do 
something about it.''	 
</P>
<P>  Jeanne Besanceney, a 34-year-old San Franciscan attending the 
conference Saturday, recently quit a lucrative job at a Silicon 
Valley dot-com to volunteer for Ralph Nader's Green Party campaign. 
She came to Bioneers, she said, because ``I think the lifestyle of 
the boom economy is alienating us from nature. Endless amounts of 
hours in front of the computers . . . the emphasis on the machine 
world. It's a false sense of community.	 
</P>
<P>  ``To come here and to stay in touch with the people I meet 
afterward -- it's the best natural antidepressant there is.''
