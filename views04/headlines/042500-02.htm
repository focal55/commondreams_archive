Janitors overwhelmingly approved a new contract Monday, ending an
imaginative and colorful three-week strike that is likely to be
remembered as a watershed moment for Los Angeles labor.
<p>Wearing their signature red strike T-shirts, the janitors celebrated
with dancing and spritzes from water bottles in the union parking lot
where nearly 2,000 cast ballots. With a county supervisor holding a mop,
a state assemblyman holding a broom and a prominent downtown building
owner donning a strike cap, the scene was a reminder of how much the
political and economic landscape has changed in recent years.
<p>The successful strike gave a shot of energy to dozens of Los Angeles
unions as they enter a summer of contract negotiations that will affect
300,000 workers, from teachers to bus drivers. It also helped galvanize
immigrant workers across the nation, who are increasingly demanding
better wages and working conditions.
<p>"This is the beginning of a new era for organized labor," declared
Mike Garcia, president of the Service Employees International Union,
Local 1877, which represents 8,500 janitors in Los Angeles County. "This
fight wasn't just about us. That's why we got such tremendous community
and political support. We were at the right place at the right time.
People were looking for an underdog to root for."
<p>While far from the $1-per-hour annual increase the union originally
sought, the contract does raise wages by more than 25% over the next
three years--more than any janitorial settlement in the past 20 years,
Garcia said.
<p>All janitors will receive an immediate $500 bonus. Those in outlying
areas will get a 30-cent raise the first year, while those in more highly
unionized downtown and Century City will get a 70-cent boost. Wages for
all janitors will increase by 60 cents a year the next two years.
<p>Contractors also will absorb any increases in health insurance costs.
And by the end of the contract, all janitors will have five days of sick
leave a year.
<p>Dick Davis, chief negotiator for the janitorial contractors, said he
would not characterize the settlement as a union victory. He said the
final numbers were "within our original parameters. It was a win for both
sides. They're happy, and we're happy."
<p>In outlying areas, which include Glendale, Pasadena, Santa Monica and
Beverly Hills, contractors had just absorbed the equivalent of a
$2-per-hour wage hike in January, when they added full medical insurance.
Davis said some were concerned that the additional raise would cause
building owners to drop their firms in favor of nonunion companies that
generally pay the minimum wage of $5.75 per hour.
<p>First-year raises for those areas were the main sticking point in the
final week of negotiations.
<p>Although the settlement was ratified with 88% of the vote, not all
janitors saw it as a clear success. "I'm medio feliz, half-happy, because
I thought we would get more," said Jose Chias, a shop steward in Woodland
Hills who was a member of the negotiating committee. "Even as united as
we were, every nickel was difficult."
<p>In the final days of negotiations, both sides were only cents apart.
Yet, at several points, it took the intervention of Mayor Richard
Riordan, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, and downtown building owner Roger
Maguire to get them back to the table.
<p>Maguire, one of the largest building owners in the county, said he
spent part of each day in the last three weeks trying to work out a deal
between the contractors and the union. On Friday, he threatened to make
his own deal with the union if the contractors didn't meet the final
union demand.
<p>To janitors, he has emerged as a near hero. Maguire appeared at the
union lot Monday after the vote to wild cheers, put a red strike-cap on
his head, and began signing strikers' T-shirts. "You do a terrific job.
You're very productive and you deserve to be supported," he told the
crowd. "I was happy to have done it, and I look forward to seeing you all
back at work in my buildings."
<p>In an interview, Maguire said the difficult negotiations had made him
reconsider the role of building owners, who typically outsource
janitorial work and have not been involved in setting wages for janitors.
"In the future, we will be involved," he said.
<p>Geoff Ely, president of the Building Owners and Managers Assn.,
however, said that was not a universal position.
<p>"The union has tried to paint with a very broad brush the entire
industry of owners and mangers of property. The fact of the matter is it
is not a homogenous group, and that's why owners don't take a role in
those negotiations."
<p>Some janitors returned to work Monday night, but most, exhausted by
weeks of marches and rallies, said they planned to return today.
<p>Every day during the three-week work stoppage, the strikers pounded
away at one simple message: Low-wage immigrant workers deserve to share
in the region's prosperity. That message resonated, not only in Los
Angeles but also across the nation.
<p>The strike drew a series of national political figures, including Vice
President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass). Scores of local and state lawmakers and religious leaders,
including Mahony, backed the janitors, some making numerous phone calls
on the union's behalf.
<p>That so many were willing to align themselves with the janitors at an
early stage in a labor dispute was in itself significant, said Daniel
Mitchell, a labor economist at UCLA. "There is an increasing public
awareness of low-wage workers, [unequal] income distribution. The issues
of poverty are beginning to resonate. And it's easier for them to
resonate in a period of general economic prosperity."
<p>Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa (D-Los Angeles) took the stage at a
post-vote rally with a broom in hand, joining a mop-wielding county
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. He said the janitors strike was likely to
inspire other unions to consider more aggressive actions, such as
strikes.
<p>"There's a feeling now that with unity and organization, they can take
on some of the most powerful individuals and win," said Villaraigosa, who
contrasted the support for immigrant workers today with the strong
opposition to undocumented immigrants evidenced by passage of Proposition
187 just six years ago.
<p>That new militancy, combined with increasing cooperation among labor,
environmental groups and others, comes as the city is gearing up for the
Democratic National Convention in August.
<p>Scores of unions supported the strikers by honoring picket lines,
staffing food banks and raising money. About $118,000 was raised from 76
union leaders at an emergency meeting called by the county Federation of
Labor last week.
<p>Janitors unions are now striking in downtown San Diego and suburban
Chicago, and strikes are possible soon in the Silicon Valley, Cleveland,
Seattle and Milwaukee, said Stephen Lerner, who directs the building
services division for the SEIU.
<p>"Part of the reason the whole labor movement rallied around this
strike is that it was a taste of what labor can and will look like as it
rejuvenates itself," Lerner said. "Many of our battles over the last 10
years have been defensive battles. This was 100% offensive.
