ROME<wbr> - <wbr>Breaking ranks with its wealthy peers, Italy pledged Friday to
forgive $4 billion to $6 billion in debt owed by 62 impoverished
countries over the next three years under easier terms than those set by
other leading industrial democracies.
<p>The initiative, approved by Parliament without dissent, was meant to
strengthen Italy's proposal at a summit next week for a similar write-off
by its rich European neighbors, plus Japan, Canada and the United States.
<p>Debt relief is the goal of a growing worldwide movement that includes
Pope John Paul II, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and an array of star
entertainers. President Clinton and other leaders endorsed the idea at
their summit a year ago but it has been slow to take effect.
<p>Under the plan, 41 heavily indebted Third World countries designated
by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are eligible for about
$100 billion in debt relief. To qualify, they must adopt free-market
reforms prescribed by those agencies, such as privatizing state property
and maximizing exports of marketable commodities.
<p>Annan complained in a letter this week that just five debtor countries
in Africa and South America had qualified for relief and that the
reduction of their financial obligations, an average of 35% each, was not
enough to pull them out of poverty. He called for "urgent action" to ease
the conditions.
<p>Italy became the first of the group to support him with action.
Instead of insisting on free-market reforms, the new Italian law offers
debt relief to poor countries that agree only to respect civil liberties,
renounce war as a means of resolving conflict, and use their freed-up
resources on health, education and reducing poverty.
<p>"This is a seismic shift," said Jamie Drummond, spokesman in London
for Jubilee 2000, a worldwide debt relief advocacy group that includes
labor unions, religious groups and economists. Until now, he said,
international debt relief policy "was made by a cartel, and now the
Italians are breaking the cartel."
<p>While Britain has been calling for a similar change of conditions,
Drummond added, Italy's "is the first piece of [debt relief] legislation
by a major creditor that makes humanitarian considerations paramount."
<p>Italy will write off all development and commercial debt owed it by 34
countries on the IMF and World Bank list and about two-thirds of the
debts owed by 28 other poor Third World nations, the Foreign Ministry
said.
<p>By obliging Italy to write off at least $4 billion in debt by
mid-2003, the law appears to accelerate a process that until now has been
moving at a snail's pace.
<p>A Foreign Ministry statement Friday called the government-sponsored
law, passed late Thursday, "an essential contribution to a broader
strategy in the struggle against poverty, in which the international
community should assume a heavier burden."
<p>Prime Minister Giuliano Amato will take that message to the summit in
Okinawa, Japan, hoping to sway the United States, Britain and Germany,
whose leaders have been particularly eager to show leadership on the
issue, Italian officials said.
<p>Amato's predecessor, Massimo D'Alema, began pushing the initiative in
January after opera singer Luciano Pavarotti and rock star Jovanotti used
Italy's biggest music festival to popularize the debt relief cause. On
stage in San Remo before 17 million TV viewers, Jovanotti chanted in rap
cadence: "Cancel the debt! One billion people on the planet live on less
than a dollar a day."
<p>Parliament also was influenced by the pope's calls for debt relief
during this Roman Catholic Holy Year, which is dedicated to forgiveness
and redemption. And the center-left government is seeking reengagement in
the world after a sharp decline in foreign assistance during the 1990s.
<p>The law includes as much as $2 billion in aid that will be combined
with partial debt relief to some countries.
<p>"This is one of the only foreign policy issues that united our
Parliament this year," Sen. Tana de Zulueta said. Debt relief terms being
offered, she said, "proved so restrictive that most countries were unable
to benefit. We were failing in our intent to allow the development of
those countries."
