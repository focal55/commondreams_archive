BERKELEY -     When thousands of activists converge later this month in 
Washington, D.C., to fray nerves and wreak havoc at the annual meeting of 
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, they will be riding a 
wave that began during the World Trade Organization riots last year in 
Seattle.
<P>  The protesters will be a diverse group of labor, environmental and social 
justice activists, but many will have one thing in common -- training from 
the Ruckus Society in Berkeley.	 
</P>
<P>  A sort of graduate school for the protest movement, the Ruckus Society is 
one of the few organizations devoted to teaching the fine art of 
demonstration tactics.	 
</P>
<P>  Working out of a bare-bones office in downtown Berkeley, the group plays 
a part in just about every major nonviolent direct action event in the 
United States and Canada, helping turn grassroots protesting into a newly 
chic movement using high-tech gear and high-visibility tactics.	 
</P>
<P>  Actor Woody Harrelson dangling from the Golden Gate Bridge in the name of 
old-growth forests? Brought to you by the Ruckus Society. Hanging a giant 
``Buy Nothing'' banner at the Mall of America in Minnesota during the 
Christmas shopping rush? Ruckus-inspired. Lock down at a San Francisco 
school to protest the Proposition 21 juvenile crime bill? Ruckus again.	 
</P>
<P>  The group, started by Earth First founder Mike Roselle, moved from 
Bozeman, Mont., to Berkeley three years ago. Director John Sellers became 
one of three paid staff members, helping propel Ruckus into a surprisingly 
well-financed force of activism, with a $370,000 budget provided by 
foundation grants and public and private donations.	 
</P>
<P>  Sellers hopes to raise $600,000 this year and open a training center in 
Oakland with a climbing wall to demonstrate how to scale buildings, welding 
equipment to show pupils how to chain themselves together and workshop space 
to make giant banners, enormous puppets and other protest props.	 
<P>  Outdoor clothing manufacturer Patagonia is so impressed by Ruckus' 
program that the company has offered to post bail for any Ruckus-
trained employee who is arrested in a nonviolent action.	 
</P>
<P>  ``They are just a great organization,'' said company spokeswoman Lu 
Setnicka. ``It's a very personal choice whether or not you're going to 
participate in an action. We want to make sure that our employees have all 
the tools at hand, so they are safe.''	 
</P>
<P>  Last year, a paltry 25 people attended a demonstration at the spring 
meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington. This year, tens of 
thousands are expected to descend on the city to demand everything from 
cancellation of foreign debts owed by poor countries to Starbucks paying 
more for its coffee beans.	 
</P>
<P>  ``We have 2,000 grads and 120 trainers,'' said Sellers, 33, who started 
his protest career working with Greenpeace, cutting 20-kilometer-
long drift nets and climbing the 110-
story Sears Tower in Chicago. ``We don't sign our actions, but it's likely 
that our alums are in there.''	 
<P>  The Ruckus Society is one of more than 400 organizations in the nation's 
capital to attend a week of teach-ins and rallies leading up to what 
organizers hope will be huge disruptions of the meetings on April 16 and 17.	 
</P>
<P>  A cadre of Ruckus staff and volunteer instructors have been there for a 
week, doing what they do best: training other people to be what Sellers 
calls ``some of the biggest troublemakers in the country.''	 
</P>
<P>  At Ruckus' annual Alternative Spring Break Camp last month in Arcadia, 
Fla., 150 budding activists -- including several members of the United 
Steelworkers of America -- attended workshops covering such eclectic topics 
as ascending buildings with climbing and cave gear, forming blockades with a 
human chain, hanging from billboards, spouting sound bites for the media and 
how to interact with police.	 
</P>
<P>  The Ruckus Society is riding high on the success of the Seattle WTO 
riots, when throngs of protesters converged on downtown Seattle, 
overwhelming police and disrupting traffic and delaying several WTO 
sessions.	 
</P>
<P>  When vandals shattered store and hotel windows and set small fires, the 
city declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew. Police used tear 
gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to restore order. Some 600 people were 
arrested.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Their egos were so jeopardized by what we had done that they swung back 
hard,'' Sellers said of the Seattle police. ``Their reaction was a huge part 
of the protest momentum.''	 
</p>
<P>  Sellers expects a very different scene this week in the capital, where 
mass protests are old hat. But the Washington, D.C., Police Department is 
not being cavalier. The department did its homework, watching videos of the 
chaos in Seattle, and will have 1,500 officers trained for civil 
disturbances in time for the demonstrations and the entire force of 3,500 
officers will be on active duty for the week, said Sgt. Joe Gentile.	 
</P>
<P>  In addition, the department spent $500,000 on new riot gear, including 
helmets and shin and glove guards. Some officers also will apparently be 
equipped with shotguns capable of firing rubber bullets.	 
</P>
<P>  ``These guys in Washington are so good. They are unbelievable with crowd 
control,'' Sellers said. ``They have a sense of how to fall back and let a 
crowd lose its own momentum.''	 
</P>
<P>  Sellers hopes that a prepared police force will make things safer for the 
protesters -- but he also concedes that it will make their job tougher.	 
</P>
<P>  ``We'll have to upgrade our tactics. We have to really be radically 
nonviolent and radically confrontational at the same time,'' he said. ``It's 
going to be a chess match out on the streets.''
