PARIS  - Greenpeace refused on Tuesday to comply
with French government orders to move away from La Hague, where
the environmental pressure group has installed a camera on an
underwater pipe discharging radioactive waste into the sea.
<p>Greenpeace used the camera to <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/%7Enuclear/ospar2000/livecamconf.html">broadcast on the internet live</a>
footage of the discharge from the nuclear reprocessing plant at
La Hague, northern France. It wants to persuade an international
panel to ban sea dumping of radioactive waste from land pipes.
<p>Greenpeace campaigner Mike Townsley said French coastguards
had ordered the group to move its ships the Twister and MV
Greenpeace, its dinghies, divers and the webcam from the area by
0800 local time on Tuesday, saying the vessels no longer had
''innocent right of passage'' in French waters.
<p>
''We've moved the Twister into UK territorial waters, but we
haven't and won't move the MV Greenpeace, and we certainly won't
move the web camera,'' Townsley told Reuters by telephone from
the MV Greenpeace.
<p>``We're just making a peaceful protest. We haven't impeded
anything. We're just showing the delegates at the OSPAR meeting
the discharge they're supposed to ban,'' he said.
<p>Ministers from the 15 countries in the OSPAR Commission, set
up to protect the environment of the North Atlantic ocean, are
meeting in Copenhagen this week to discuss a proposal by Denmark
to ban sea dumping of radioactive waste from land pipes.
<p>OSPAR has already banned other forms of sea dumping of
nuclear waste -- from ships, platforms and aircraft.
<p>Townsley said Greenpeace could face a one million franc
($142,300) fine for defying the authorities while MV Greenpeace
captain John Castle might face up to six months in prison.
<p>Maritime officials, who sent a patrol boat to investigate,
said Greenpeace was breaking international and French law by
stopping, anchoring and diving near the pipe outlet.
<p>They said they would ``not start a naval battle'' but would
report back to the public prosecutor, who could impose a fine or
order the seizure of the Greenpeace boats.
<p>State-run nuclear fuels group Cogema, which owns the nuclear
fuel reprocessing plant at La Hague, said the radioactive waste
leaving the pipe was monitored before being dumped and met
existing standards on health and environmental impact.
<p>In a bid to dispel its secretive image, Cogema installed 10
permanent web cameras at its reprocessing site seven months ago
but it has not fixed a camera to the discharge pipe, located 30
meters under the sea in an area of fierce currents.
<p>``You can't see a lot because its deep under water and
changes in tides and currents make installing that kind of
material under water very difficult,'' a press official at the
company told Reuters, adding that photos of the discharge pipe
could be consulted on the company's internet site.
<p>Townsley said some eight OSPAR states favored a ban on all
sea dumping of nuclear waste but France and Britain, the only
countries outside Russia which still reprocess spent nuclear
fuel, were opposed. Twelve votes are needed to approve the ban.
<p>Cogema press officials were not immediately able to answer
allegations by Greenpeace that the plant had ignored a legally-
binding OSPAR commitment to significantly reduce the volume and
concentration of nuclear waste dumped in the sea by 2000.
<p>Greenpeace said on Saturday independent surveys showed 80
percent of Europeans opposed dumping nuclear waste in the sea.
