Anyone who thinks the world has heard
the end of U.S. arguments for a National Missile Defense (NMD)
because President Clinton said on Friday he would leave the
issue to his successor should think again.
<p>His announcement reflected a realization that months of
trying to persuade Russia to amend a Soviet-era pact not to
build a system to shoot down each other's missiles had failed --
but only for this administration, analysts said.

<font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A payload launch vehicle carrying an anti-missile interceptor is launched from Meck Island in the Kwajalein Missile Range for a planned intercept of a ballistic missile target over the central Pacific Ocean in this Jan. 18, 2000 file photo. The target vehicle was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., and was not destroyed after the "kill vehicle" failed to separate from the booster rocket. President Clinton has decided to leave to his successor the tough decision on beginning deployment of a national defense against ballistic missile attack, two senior administration officials said. The president  announced his decision in a speech Friday, Sept. 1, 2000, at Georgetown University. (AP Photo/Department of Defense, file) <br>

</TABLE></font></font>``In essence, what he has done is bought time to discuss with
the allies and with the Russians and the Chinese how one ought
to proceed, and that's significant,'' said Ivo Daalder, senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.
<p>``On the other hand, it would be a mistake to believe that
this is the end of the NMD saga. The proverbial can has been
kicked down the road,'' he said.
<p>He said he expected whoever took over from Clinton in
January to ``proceed with a vigorous development and possible
deployment'' of NMD, a system to shoot down missiles. Its
creation was prompted by concerns about programs in North Korea,
Iran and Iraq.
<p>Democratic candidate Vice-President Al Gore  said he would
try to build a consensus abroad on a limited system to shield
U.S. territory -- though like Clinton, he said failure to do so
would not stop him if the threat required it.
<p>This would mean getting Russian agreement to update the
U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty of 1972, which is seen
as the cornerstone of arms accords.
<p>It was designed to stop precisely this kind of system being
built for fear it would encourage the other side to build more
missiles to overcome the shield.
<p>Clinton and Gore argue their NMD is not aimed against Russia
and that it is necessary because of the new threats emerging in
other countries in the post-Soviet era.
<p>Republican contender George W. Bush , who favors a much
broader land- and sea-based system, said he welcomed the
opportunity to act where Clinton and Gore had failed to lead by
''developing and deploying effective missile defenses to protect
all 50 states and our friends and allies.''
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="2">Europeans Relieved, Russia And China Cautious</font></b></font>
<p>European allies were clearly relieved at Clinton's decision
after months of worrying about what might happen if Clinton
decided to go ahead with the shield without Moscow's consent.
<p>NATO called it ``prudent.'' Germany said it was ``wise.''
<p>Analysts said Clinton opened the door to months of talks
with Moscow and Beijing, which have always been vociferously
against NMD for fear it would neutralize their defenses.
<p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian
defense ministry official as saying his announcement showed
''elements of a constructive approach.''
Press Counselor Zhang Yuanyuan at the Chinese embassy welcomed
the chance for Washington to ``listen to the views from other
countries, including from U.S. allies in Europe, to arrive at a
wise decision and not deploy NMD.''
<p>Russia and China tapped into European fears that it could
destabilize the delicate balance of arms control agreements to
push their argument against NMD.
<p>``But they would be mistaken to believe that they have won''
in their campaign to stop NMD altogether, Daalder said.
<p>In the short-term, the Clinton announcement should take the
heat out of bilateral meetings at the United Nations Millennium
Summit in New York next week, where he is due to meet Russian
President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday and is likely to see
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
<p>The issue will also be the theme of discussions between
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov in New York on Monday.
<p>It will also feature in Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
also at the U.N., on Tuesday.
