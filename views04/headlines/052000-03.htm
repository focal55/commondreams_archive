The Pentagon has classified as secret an antimissile critic's letter to 
the White House, and the censored 
expert is crying foul.

<p>      The critic, Theodore A. Postol, professor of science and national security studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, first wrote the 
White House on May 11 to report 
what he described as a major flaw in 
the Pentagon's antimissile plan and 
efforts to cover it up.

<p>      Yesterday, Dr. Postol wrote the 
White House again, this time to say 
that the Pentagon had classified his 
letter secret  and to condemn what he 
said was probably a bid to curb the 
high-stakes dispute. The antimissile 
system under consideration is estimated to cost as much as $60 billion. 

<p>      In his latest letter, Dr. Postol said 
the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which ordered 
the imposition of secrecy, "is most 
likely attempting to illegally use the 
security and classification system to 
hide waste, fraud, and abuse."

<p>      If secrets were inadvertantly released in his earlier letter, he added, 
it was because his analysis was 
based on Pentagon documents that 
the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization had improperly declassified.

<p>      In his letter, which he made available to The New York Times, Dr. 
Postol asked John D. Podesta, the 
White House chief of staff, to alert 
his colleagues of the "claimed status" of the May 11 letter and to 
"refer this matter to the Department 
of Defense inspector general for immediate investigation."

<p>      Yesterday, the White House referred requests for comment to the 
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.

<p>      Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air 
Force, a spokesman for the organization, said that no one was accusing 
Dr. Postol of releasing secrets but 
that the antimissile office was taking 
steps to classify the letter and its 
appended reports.

<p>      Colonel Lehner said that one of the 
reports Dr. Postol had sent to the 
White House apparently contained 
three or four charts of secret data 
that declassification officers had 
failed to delete.

<p>      "If even one word is classified, 
then the whole thing is classified 
until the secret part is removed," the 
colonel said, describing  the usual 
federal policy concerning secret documents.

<p>      Still, the Pentagon's move to classify is unlikely to have much practical effect because the letter  has circulated widely throughout the administration, Congress and the 
world, with hundreds, if not thousands, of electronic copies speeding 
across the Internet.

<p>  It even appears on the Web site of 
the Institute of Physics and Technology in Moscow.

<p>      Dr. Postol's May 11 letter was 
three pages long and had four reports attached to it that were meant 
to back up his technical claims. 

<p>      His criticism of the proposed antimissile system centers on the most 
technically difficult part of the system's goal -- enabling a speeding 
interceptor to distinguish incoming 
weapons from clouds of decoys.

<p>  Dr. Postol contended that a pivotal 
flight test in June 1997 showed that 
the objective  was impossible to 
achieve, and that the Pentagon then 
conspired to hide this surprising discovery.

<p>      His accusations are based partly 
on antimissile criticism by Nira 
Schwartz, a former senior engineer 
at the TRW Corporation, a top military contractor.

<p>  In a lawsuit against the company, 
Dr. Schwartz said that TRW had 
faked results of antimissile tests and 
evaluations of computer programs 
for the interceptor's sensor and fired 
her when she protested. The company has denied her accusations.

<p>      Through her litigation with TRW 
as well as an inquiry by the Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Dr. Schwartz obtained 
many antimissile reports and data, 
some of which she shared with Dr. 
Postol. 

<p>      Such documents and data from 
them presumably lie at the heart of 
any Pentagon concerns about leaked 
secrets.
