WASHINGTON  - In light of a proposed merger of two
multinational
oil companies announced this week, consumer and environmental
groups  are
warning that the growing concentration of power and wealth of the
oil  industry
is unsafe for the environment, communities, and consumers
worldwide. 
<P>
On Oct. 15, California-based Chevron Corporation agreed to acquire
Texaco Inc.
for about 36 billion dollars in stock, creating the world's fourth-largest oil
company. The acquisition comes at a time when crude oil prices
have hit their
highest in a decade, while oil company profits have skyrocketed. 
<P>
Both companies are expected to be forced to sell off some of their
as sets in
order to win approval by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Regardless of the
long road before the acquisition is approved, the merger will
likely  go ahead
relatively smoothly since the green-light has already been given
recently to
several even larger oil mergers. 
<P>
In April, British Petroleum (BP) Amoco and ARCO (Atlantic
Richfield C ompany)
received clearance from the US FTC for the combination of their
companies.
The union will create a corporate group worth some 200 billion
dollars.  
<P>
And in late 1999, the regulatory agency approved the 82 billion
dollar merger
of Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation. 
<P>
Consumer and environmental groups alike are concerned that the
recent  spate of
mergers will lead to an unhealthy concentration of power. They say
the mergers
are unmaking history by putting back some of the pieces of the
Standard Oil
empire that was broken up into 34 companies by the US Supreme
Court i n 1911. 
<P>
Exxon was originally Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was
once  Standard
Oil of New York. Atlantic Refining was one of the Standard Oil
companies
and in
1965 was later named ARCO. Standard Oil of California was renamed
Chevron,
while Standard Oil of Indiana was renamed Amoco. Standard Oil of
Ohio  was
bought out in 1987 by British Petroleum. 
<P>
Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy
Project says
that this trend toward more consolidation is bad for consumers in
the  long run
and has the added impact of increasing the political power of
these larger
companies to influence environmental and energy policy. 
<P>
Most of these recently merged oil companies have been involved in
campaigns
against an international agreement on climate change, known as the
Kyoto
Protocol. The treaty requires industrialised countries to reduce
their
heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, caused by the burning of
coal, oil,
and
petrol. 
<P>
The influence of the oil companies on US lawmakers, through
campaign
contributions and lobbying, has already thwarted ratification of
the  Protocol.
As they merge, their views become even more commanding. 
<P>
Rather than moving away from the use of oil, these larger, more
politically
powerful companies, says Hauter, ''can influence public policy and
th is
results
in more subsidies, more tax breaks for the oil industry and
increased  pressure
to drill in environmentally sensitive areas''. 
<P>
James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, an
advocacy group
based in Washington, says that worldwide consolidation of the oil
industry
makes it easier for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries
(OPEC) to
keep prices high. 
<P>
''OPEC benefits from increased oil company concentration, which
makes  it much
easier to monitor private actions and even to solicit co-operation
fr om the
leading private actors,'' he told reporters. 
<P>
Some politicians have also voiced concern about the mergers. Upon
announcement
of the Chevron-Texaco merger, Chris Lehane, a spokesman for
Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore told reporters: ''Given the fact
that  oil
companies saw their profits rise by more than 300 percent in the
past  year, it
raises the question whether big oil is getting too big.'' 
<P>
Despite Vice President Gore's family connection to Occidental
Petroleum, the
Presidential candidate has donned a populist hat. He said various
times while
on the campaign trail that ''big oil'' was getting too powerful.  
<P>
Environmental groups are campaigning against California-based
Occidental to
stop drilling for oil on land claimed by an indigenous tribe in
Colombia. 
<P>
Environmentalists say that the Chevron-Texaco merger unites two
''corporate
criminals'' which have troubled records on the environment and
human  rights.
Both companies are currently being sued in US court for their
operations
abroad
which allegedly have led to environmental and human rights
violations. 
<P>
''These facts are rarely considered by the regulators when looking
at  mergers
and acquisitions, but they should be,'' says Danny Kennedy,
executive  director
of Project Underground, a California-based environmental watchdog. 
<P>
Chevron is facing a lawsuit in Federal Court for its alleged role
in
providing the Nigerian military with equipment that was used to
attack
people protesting the oil companies in 1998. The company is also
accused
of aiding the military in an attack on the villages of Opia and
Ikenyan
in the Niger Delta region. 
<P>
New York-based Texaco is facing a billion-dollar class action
lawsuit  filed by
people in Ecuador, including several indigenous tribes, charging
the  company
deliberately polluted the environment. 
<P>
According to Judith Kimerling, a lawyer who first documented the
impact of oil
development on the Ecuadorian Amazon in the 1991 book 'Amazon
Crude',  Texaco
discharged an estimated 4.3 million gallons of highly toxic
''produced'' water
per day into the rain forest, as it pumped billions of gallons of
crude out of
Ecuador. 
<P>
The plaintiffs claim that the company - which denies all charges -  
ignored oil 
industry standards and instead of re-injecting the waste into the  
ground, 
Texaco dumped its toxic cocktail of chemicals into unlined pits  
that 
eventually 
leached into streams and rivers. 
<P>
Paulina Garzon with the Center for Economic and Social Rights in  
Quito, 
Ecuador 
has worked with indigenous communities in documenting the impact  
of pollution 
allegedly caused by Texaco's past operations. 
<P>
''Now, we find that the first thing (oil) companies say when they  
come to 
Ecuador is that they are not like Texaco,'' says Garzon.
