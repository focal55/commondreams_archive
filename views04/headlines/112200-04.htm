THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Demonstrators disrupted a major
conference on global warming Wednesday with dozens of protesters
staging a sit-in and a cake thrower targeting the top U.S.
negotiator.
<p>The uproar came as discussion at the U.N. climate conference
focused on how to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases,
blamed by much of the scientific community for global warming.

<font size="1">U.S. chief negotiator Frank Loy is hit in the face with a custard pie by a protester angry at what activists say is U.S. reluctance to do anything meaningful to fight global warming at United Nations climate talks in the Hague November 22, 2000. The United States and the European Union dug deeper into opposing positions amid raucous scenes at U.N. climate talks as efforts to agree ways to fight global warming appeared stuck in low gear.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font>Key contentious issues include how far countries should be able
to use the carbon dioxide absorbed by forests and agricultural
lands against emission reductions targets and to what extent
nations should be able to buy their way into complying with their
targets.
<p>But the high-level talks were disrupted when several dozen
environmental activists entered the high security building, broke
into a committee meeting and staged a sit-in. Conference President
Jan Pronk said equipment was damaged and small fires were set in
the building.
<p>In an apparently unrelated incident, a woman pressed a chocolate
cream cake into the face of the chief U.S. negotiator, Under
Secretary of State Frank E. Loy as the American delegation gave its
daily press briefing. The woman then calmly walked out of the room.
<p>A second woman then stood up on a chair and screamed at the
delegates before being escorted out by a conference technician. Her
words were indecipherable. Conference officials said the identity
of the women were unknown.
<p>``On the eve of Thanksgiving, pumpkin pie would have been a more
traditional choice, but what I really want is a strong agreement to
fight global warming. I'm headed back to the negotiating table
right now with that aim,'' Loy said after the incident.
<p>He then excused himself and the briefing was called off.
<p>Environmental activists sitting outside the meeting room told
The Associated Press they sneaked into the building to disrupt
proceedings because they believed the goal of the meeting had
betrayed the spirit of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The protocol
committed the developing world to reduce their greenhouse gas
emissions by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels.
<p>The U.N. conference, which involves delegates from more than 180
countries, has two days left to decide how to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, according to the Kyoto agreement.
<p>They environmental activists said they were not connected with
the women who disrupted Loy's briefing, nor with any environmental
organization.
<p>Dutch police said they had arrested around 100 protesters
Wednesday near The Hague's central train station. The activists
were planning to march to a number of embassies to protest against
nuclear energy, but did not have a permit.
<p>Protesters in the conference building said they believed the
negotiations were watering down environmental protection.
<p>Conferees are debating different ways that nations can use to
meet their emission reductions targets.
<p>One strategy includes the idea of international trading of
emissions credits, where countries who will have no trouble meeting
their goal could sell their surplus credits to those who are
struggling to meet the target. The United States wants unlimited
trading in credits.
<p>Another mechanism involves a voluntary compliance fund, where
parties can pay into a fund that will act as an agent to buy
foreign credits to help them meet their emissions targets.
<p>``They are woefully inadequate at addressing the issues,'' said
Kim Webster, one of the group's protesters from England. Webster
accused delegates of avoiding the ``real'' issues and called on
them to increase spending on renewable energy sources.
<p>``They need to stop talking about how to make money from climate
change,'' she said.
