ST. PAUL, Minn.  -- As the office of president hangs in the
balance a week after Election Day, Ralph Nader brushed off his role
as a spoiler.
<p>
   The Green Party candidate on Tuesday blamed Democratic Vice
President Al Gore for not inspiring more people to vote for him.
<p>
   ''There aren't many presidential candidates who can't carry
their own state,'' he said.
<p>
   Nader, who has been criticized in recent weeks by some for
taking votes from Gore, showed no remorse.

</TABLE></font>''Third parties are considered relevant only if they tip the
ballot,'' he said before speaking to hundreds gathered the
University of St. Thomas about ''the corporatization of America.''
<p>
   The battle continues between Gore and Republican George W. Bush
over Florida's 25 electoral votes, reinforcing how important those
Nader votes were.
<p>
   Nader carried about 3 percent of the vote nationally, including
5 percent in Minnesota and 1 percent (or 97,421 votes) in Florida,
the state likely to decide the presidential race.
<p>
   Exit polls suggested that nearly half the Nader voters would
have voted for Gore if it had been a two-way race and about
one-fifth would have voted for Bush.
<p>
   Bush's lead in Florida dwindled to 300 votes after a week of
recounts, hand counts and numerous legal challenges.
<p>
   ''Because of the closeness of the vote tally, I don't think it
will ever be truly known who won Florida. ... It's going to
probably be decided in the courts,'' Nader said.
<p>
   The longtime consumer advocate said he opposed hand counts to
determine a winner unless it were done in every county. Whatever
method is used to determine a winner, it should be uniform, he
said.
<p>
   ''I'd be against a hand count in four counties. ... It certainly
calls for a change in the future,'' he said.
<p>
   Despite the possibility of one presidential candidate receiving
the popular vote and one receiving the electoral college vote,
Nader said it was unlikely that the Electoral College would be
abolished.
<p>
   ''The small states like the Electoral College,'' he said, adding
that ''there's no period in our history that provoked the need to
look at change like the last week.''
<p>
   Nader remained unapologetic, urging people to support a ''viable
third party'' that would serve as a watchdog for Republicans and
Democrats after Election Day.
<p>
   ''We're going into more of a lobbying mode,'' he said. ''The
Green Party has to play a watchdog role ... to hold the two
parties' feet to the fire.''
<p>
   No matter who ultimately is named president, Nader said, the
winner isn't likely to get much done due to the closeness of the
race and the makeup of Congress.
<p>
   ''There's not going to be anything bold ... accomplished in the
next four years,'' he said.
<p>
   Nader's long-shot campaign emphasized his criticism of big
business and the two-party political system. He has long insisted
that no major differences exist between the Democrats and the
Republicans -- or their presidential candidates.
<p>
   ''The presidential elections are too much about horse races and
not enough about serious proposals,'' he said.
<p>
   He said it was too early to say whether he would run again in
2004.
<p>
   ''The Green Party effort this year, which will build to
thousands of state, local and federal candidates in the year 2002,
will spell the end of the two-party grip on our political system,''
he said.
<p>
   He said he disagreed with the notion that the Green Party should
build itself from the bottom up.
<p>
   ''I don't buy this start at one end or the other,'' he said.
''We should start at all ends.''
