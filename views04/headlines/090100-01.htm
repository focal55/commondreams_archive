Ralph Nader, running for president as the Green Party nominee, 
railed against big business from the 
heart of corporate America yesterday, crisscrossing Manhattan to condemn environmental pollution, the 
exploitation of workers and the 
abuse of taxpayer dollars through 
"corporate welfare."

<p> He also dismissed his opponents, 
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. 
George W. Bush of Texas, as candidates whose similarities (favoring 
businesses over workers, in Mr. Nader's view, and taking millions from 
corporate donors) outweighed their 
differences.

</TABLE>Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate 
whose long-shot candidacy has received comparatively little national 
media attention, began his salvos 
from a prominent platform: a morning interview with Matt Lauer on 
NBC's "Today" show.

<p>  "They are different in a few areas, 
but the rhetoric is more different 
than the reality," Mr. Nader said of 
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore on "Today," 
as about 300 people milled about on a 
Rockefeller Center sidewalk outside 
the studio. Some held signs demanding that the major candidates open 
the presidential debates to Mr. Nader and one of the Reform Party 
candidates, Patrick J. Buchanan. 
Two men made the point  by wearing 
chicken suits to represent Mr. Bush 
and Mr. Gore.

<p>    After "Today," Mr. Nader gave  a 
separate interview on NBC's cable 
cousin, MSNBC, then crossed the 
street to the headquarters of the network's corporate parent, General 
Electric,  where he criticized the 
company for polluting the Hudson 
River.   
<p>He also attacked Mr. Gore 
and Mr. Bush for taking contributions from the company.

<p> "It is time for General Electric to 
obey the law and pay for its poisoning of the Hudson River and stop 
lying and deceiving the public about 
the dangers," Mr. Nader said, referring to G.E.'s legal discharge of 
PCB's  into the Hudson until 1977, 
when the chemicals were banned by 
the federal government.   
<p>He called 
for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to give 
back the money their campaigns had 
received from General Electric.

<p> From there, Mr. Nader went to the 
Bowery, where he protested with 
union workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim sum 
parlor and banquet hall that once 
was the only unionized restaurant in 
Chinatown. Former employees have 
waged a three-year battle with the 
restaurant's management, which 
has been accused by federal labor 
officials of antiunion hiring practices.

<p> Mr. Nader finished his campaign 
day on Wall Street, where he criticized the City and State of New York 
for offering multimillion-dollar tax 
breaks and other incentives to persuade companies like the New York 
Stock Exchange  to stay in Manhattan.

<p> "Here is this bastion of global capitalism on welfare," Mr. Nader said, 
after taking a private tour of the New 
York Stock Exchange. "It will take 
hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in order to build them a new 
building. At the same time, hundreds 
of neighborhoods are suffering from 
inadequate funding of their vital 
needs."

<p> Mr. Nader said that such "corporate welfare" was emblematic of the 
problems of America's current two-party political system. Mr. Nader's 
candidacy is widely seen less as an 
attempt to capture the White House 
in November than an effort to influence the public debate.

<p>  At various points since announcing 
his candidacy, it appeared as if Mr. 
Nader could garner a high enough 
percentage of the vote -- mostly 
from Mr. Gore -- in several important states, including California and 
Michigan, to push Mr. Bush ahead.

<p> But recent polls have suggested 
that Mr. Nader's moment appears to 
be fading, given Mr. Gore's surge  in 
the polls after the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.

<p> For example, a Field poll released 
last week showed that Mr. Nader 
was supported by 4 percent of California voters, compared with 7 percent in a similar survey in June.

<p> Mr. Nader's swing through New 
York City yesterday followed a series of fund-raisers and appearances 
on the East End of Long Island on 
Wednesday. Earlier in the week, he 
and his running mate, Winona LaDuke, staged a boisterous rally in 
Portland, Ore., that drew more than 
10,000 people.

<p> At his Manhattan appearances, 
Mr. Nader was trailed by small but 
loyal bands of supporters: college 
and high school students, environmentalists and those who said they 
were concerned about the influence 
of large corporations.

<p>   "I don't care how much of a threat 
he is to Bush and Gore," said David 
Joseph, 33, a graduate  student in 
French at Hunter College,  outside 
the NBC studios yesterday morning. 
"I want to see something new, something fresh in the debates."

<p> Steve Rogovin, 59, of River Vale, 
N.J., who moved off the steps of a 
building for Mr. Nader's Wall Street 
news conference, said he would probably not vote for Mr. Nader, but was 
happy to see him in the race.

<p> "He is man for the people," Mr. 
Rogovin said. "I don't believe he will 
get elected or get a chance to debate 
the two power brokers. Think, he 
would act as devil's advocate."

<p> That is why, Mr. Rogovin said, he 
answered, "By all means" when Mr. 
Nader asked if he could use the steps.
