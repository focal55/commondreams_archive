<p>In a major boost for the forces of
economic globalisation, US President Bill Clinton has decided to
back multinational corporations in a key court challenge to a
Massachusetts law designed to promote democracy in Burma.
<P>
   In a brief quietly filed with the Supreme Court Tuesday,
Clinton's Justice Department charged that cities and states which
make it more difficult for companies doing business in repressive
countries to win procurement contracts "impermissibly intrude into
the national government's exclusive authority over foreign
affairs." 
<P>
   Joining a coalition of some 600 major multinational
corporations, the European Union (EU) and Japan, the
administration
asked the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments on the
case
March 22, to declare the Massachusetts law unconstitutional. A
final judgment by the nine-member court is expected in June. 
<P>
   The case, called "Natsios versus the National Foreign Trade
Council (NFTC)," has major implications for grassroots human
rights
and other US activist groups, which over the past 25 years have
used state and local "selective-purchasing" laws to influence the
behaviour of multi-national corporations abroad. 
<P>
   Selective-purchasing laws are designed to force companies to
choose between continuing to do business with repressive foreign
governments and bidding on often-lucrative state or local
government contracts. The Massachusetts law, for example, adds 10
percent to any bid by a target companies - foreign and domestic -
on a state procurement contract. 
<P>
   Such laws were used most successfully during the late 1970s and
1980s to force scores of US multinationals - including such giants
as Coca-Cola, IBM, and General Motors - to withdraw from South
Africa because of apartheid. The resulting divestment, according
to most experts, played a crucial role in bringing about majority
rule. 
<P>
   Similar laws in New York, California, Pennsylvania and other
states and cities targeting Swiss banks and insurance companies
which had failed to adequately account to Nazi Holocaust victims
and their families helped prompt a settlement of outstanding
claims
in 1998. 
<P>
   Some two dozen states and cities, including New York, Los
Angeles, and San Francisco - which each year put hundreds of
millions of dollars in contracts up for bids - have enacted
selective-purchasing laws against companies doing business in
Burma, where a military junta has repressed the democratic
opposition led by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. 
<P>
   Multinationals naturally oppose these initiatives because they
curb their freedom to do business where they like. But until now,
they were reluctant to challenge the laws in court due to the
negative publicity that could result from a company claiming a
right to do business with abusive governments. 
<P>
   In 1998, however, the NFTC filed a case in federal court
challenging the 1996 Massachusetts law on the grounds that it
violated US constitutional provisions which gave the federal
government the power to regulate foreign commerce and foreign
policy. In an unprecedented step, the EU and Japan filed amicus
curiae (friend of the court) briefs on the NFTC's behalf. 
<P>
   At the same time, Brussels and Tokyo also filed their own
challenges to the law with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in
Geneva. They claimed that Massachusetts, by enacting the law, had
violated the WTO's 1995 Government Procurement Agreement (GPA),
which forbids states from using non-economic criteria in deciding
contract bids. 
<P>
   The Clinton administration, deeply split on the issue, stayed
out of the case. While strong supporters of globalisation, like
the
Treasury and Commerce Departments, argued for backing the NFTC,
other offices, especially in the State Department and the National
Security Council, opposed taking any position. 
<P>
   In a letter to state officials in April 1998, Secretary of
State
Madeleine Albright expressed the administration's deep
ambivalence. 
<P>
   "Our challenge," she wrote, "is to ensure that America speaks
with a single voice." She also noted, however, that "President
Clinton and I recognise the authority of state and local officials
to determine their own investment and procurement policies, and
the
right - indeed their responsibility - to take moral considerations
into account as they do so." 
<P>
   The latter position is the one taken by Massachusetts in the
case. "The states should be free...to apply a moral standard to
their spending decisions," according to a brief filed by the
state,
which, in a rare breach of legal protocol, was not informed in
advance by the administration - apparently to avoid publicity - of
its own submission. 
<P>
   "Nothing in the federal Constitution...requires the states to
trade with dictators," argues the Massachusetts brief, which is
supported by amicus briefs from more than two dozen states and
cities, some 24 members of Congress, and a plethora of human
rights
and labour groups. 
<P>
   The Clinton administration brief stresses that it, too,
strongly
opposes the current government in Burma and has imposed trade and
other sanctions against it. 
<P>
   "The disagreement," according to the brief, "is only over
whether the State could permissibly take the sort of action
reflected in the Massachusetts Burma Act." 
<P>
   Citing complaints against the law by the EU, Japan, and the
Association for Southeast Asian Nations, the administration goes
onto argue that it has "complicated (US) efforts to develop a
multilateral strategy" and thus "impermissibly infringe(s) upon
the
national government's exclusive authority to conduct foreign
affairs." 
<P>
   "Indeed, if the (Act) were sustained, a multitude of different,
and differing state and local measures sanctioning foreign
governments could be expected," the brief states, adding that
similar selective-purchasing statutes have been or adopted or
considered against companies doing business in China, Cuba, Egypt,
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Morocco, Nigeria, North Korea,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Switzerland, Tibet, Turkey, and
Vietnam. 
<P>
   The administration's arguments echo those made by the two
courts
which have considered the case to date. In November 1998, US
federal court judge Joseph Tauro ruled that "State interests, no
matter how noble, do not trump the federal government's exclusive
foreign affairs power." 
<P>
   Last June, in a more sweeping decision, a three-judge federal
appeals court in Boston found that "the conduct of this nation's
foreign affairs cannot be effectively managed on behalf of all the
nation's citizens if each of the many state and local governments
pursues its own foreign policy." 
<P>
   But supporters of the Act remain confident. "This could
actually
backfire against the administration," noted Robert Stumberg, a
professor at Georgetown Law Centre. "Some justices who might have
been more sympathetic to the administration's case may now be more
inclined to see in this a major extension of federal power at the
expense of state and local authorities." 
<P>
   The Court's majority consists of justices appointed by
Republican presidents, who generally have been more solicitous of
state and local rights. Ironically, President Ronald Reagan's
attorney-general, a strong supporter of apartheid South Africa,
opposed a constitutional challenge to the selective-purchasing
laws
against Pretoria for precisely that reason. 
<P>
   "The administration's brief amounts to an unparalleled attack
by the federal government on state sovereignty and local democracy
and really makes a sharp contrast with even the Reagan
administration's view that selective-purchasing laws were
constitutional," says Simon Billeness, a financial analyst in
Boston who has led the anti-Burma campaign there. 
<P>
   Whatever the Supreme Court decides, however, the case's main
impact may actually work against the WTO, which was already badly 
wounded by the debacle of its Seattle meeting last December, 
according to Stumberg. 
<P>
   In 1994, when the administration was negotiating with Congress 
over Washington's membership in the WTO, it offered assurances to 
the attorneys-general of all 50 US states that private  
corporations 
could not sue states in connection with WTO agreements, including 
any constitution-based challenges to state laws. 
<P>
   "To get it through Congress, that's what the US Trade 
Representative agreed to," said Stumberg. "Now the fact that the 
administration is lining up with the corporations will not help  
the 
USTR's credibility when new trade agreements come up."
