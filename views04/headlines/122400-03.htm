DAVID LANDAU: Pacifica Radio has struck with full force at 
Pacifica station WBAI. At about midnight last night, under 
instructions from Pacifica Executive Director Bessie Wash, 
locksmiths changed the locks at WBAI and security guards began 
barring entrance to all except hosts and guests of regularly 
scheduled shows. No other staff members were being admitted 
into the station, and that includes, Amy Goodman, whose national 
show on Pacifica, Democracy Now!,  is produced at WBAI.  

<p>AMY GOODMAN: Last night, as the locks were being changed on 
the doors, I called into the station. I spoke with the operations 
director, Sidney Smith. I asked him if I could come into the station. 
And Utrice Leid, the new Pacifica-appointed general manager ,  
was standing next to him. Sidney asked her if I could come in and 
she said no. I saw her today, uh, there was a protest, uh, of more 
than 100 people outside the station that was just ad hoc pulled 
together...I wanted to go up. She wouldn't let me go into the station. 
It's an illegal lockout of union workers, both UE, United 
Electrical...I'm AFTRA...  

<p>We were not able to go in. When we attempted to go in, as 
workers, as producers, the security prevented us from going up and 
they called in police and they pushed us out of the building. And 
so, we were outside, as Bessie Wash and Utrice Leid were 
upstairs.  


<p>LANDAU: Besides hosting Democracy Now! Goodman also co-
hosts WBAI's three-hour morning show, Wake Up Call. The crisis 
at WBAI has been brewing since October, when Pacifica 
management gave Goodman a new set of guidelines for 
Democracy Now! and threatened to fire her if she failed to obey.  

<p>Then, last month,  Pacifica Executive Director Wash, informed 
WBAI general manager Valerie van Isler that she would no longer 
be serving in that position. Van Isler said she would not observe the 
termination date of December 31st and would appeal the decision. 
WBAI staff announced that they would not cooperate with the 
Pacifica -imposed regime at the station. At least one staff member 
decided not to accept appointment as van Isler's successor.  

<p>Then last night, Wash appointed programmer Utrice Leid, whom 
van Isler had earlier passed over for the program director;s position, 
as interim station manager. Early this morning, Pacifica fired WBAI 
Program Director Bernard White who also co-hosts the morning 
drive show, Wale Up Call, as well as Sharan Louise Harper,  who 
produces the morning drive show.  

<p>Harper told KPFA about receiving Pacifica's notice of dismissal at 
her home, early this morning.  

<p>SHARAN HARPER: There was a knock at my door. And there was 
a messenger who had an envelope with a Pacifica logo on it and 
said,"This is for you. You have to sign for it. I opened the envelope 
and inside was a letter that said that effective immediately, I had 
been...I'm paraphrasing because I don't have the letter...It said that 
I had been terminated, that I was being given a check that was 
equivalent to two weeks severance...if I thought I was owed further 
compensation, then I would have to notify the the signer and 
explain why, and the signer was Bessie Wash. It said that my 
personal belongings would be sent to me, and that I was no longer 
considered staff and if I should enter the premises, that it would be 
considered trespass.
<p>LANDAU: An identical procedure was also taking place at the 
home of program director Bernard White. Neither staff member was 
given an explanation for the dismissal. Both refused to sign 
Pacifica's letter. Both declined to take their severance checks. 
Both later found their checks under their door.  

<p>White said a key question now is whether the remaining on-air staff 
at WBAI will cooperate with Pacifica's new regime.  

<p>BERNARD WHITE: We have had people on the inside...quislings 
on the inside who have collaborated with Pacifica National and it 
becomes somewhat confusing to our audience because the person 
who has collaborated is very popular a person. I don't know how 
popular she'll be once people find out what she has done to the 
station, There is definitely going to be..as she was on the air 
saying there would be no changes in programming..everything 
would go pretty much the same.  

<p>LANDAU: In spite of what interim manager Utrice Led said, 
however, program changes have already begun. The new interim 
manager will reportedly take over the morning show and will give her 
afternoon show to someone else. An on-air WBAI tech-in earlier 
today included many outspoken comments about the station 
situation, while about 150 listeners demonstrated for several hours 
in freezing cold outside the station.  

<p>Neither WBAI interim manager Leid nor Pacifica Executive Director 
Wash could be reached for comment about this situation. Fired 
WBAI staffer Sharan Harper:  

<p>HARPER: My biggest concern is not for my employment but for 
the continuance of free speech radio. I think this issue is far bigger 
than my termination or Valerie's or Bernard's . The biggest 
termination we have to be concerned with is the termination of free 
speech.  

<p>LANDAU: For KPFA news, this is David Landau.
