<p>LONDON - Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet was free to go home Thursday as Britain halted extradition proceedings after more than 16 months of legal wrangling.</p>
<p>Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw said he had decided to release Pinochet, 84, wanted in Spain to face torture charges relating to his 1973-1990 military regime, as he was mentally unfit to stand trial.</p>
<p>Within two hours of Straw's ruling, a six-vehicle convoy led by two police motorcycles left the luxury residence southwest of London where Pinochet has been under house arrest.</p>
<p>Police confirmed Pinochet and his entourage were in the convoy, but refused to disclose his destination.</p>
<p>Straw said independent medical tests had shown Pinochet was unfit mentally to stand trial, and last-minute representations from Spain and three other countries seeking his extradition had failed to convince him otherwise.</p>
<p>Extradition requests from Belgium, France and Switzerland would not be allowed to proceed, he said.</p>
<p>As the decision was announced, supporters reacted with delight and opponents with anger, while human rights groups said the case had at least made the world a more uncomfortable place for rights abusers.</p>
<p>Madrid immediately signalled that it would not appeal Straw's decision, while Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said Pinochet would not be tried here.</p>
<p>In a written parliamentary statement, Straw said: "The principle that an accused person should be mentally capable of following the proceedings, instructing his lawyers and giving coherent evidence is fundamental to the idea of a fair trial.</p>
<p>"An attempted trial of an accused in the condition diagnosed in Senator Pinochet would not be a fair trial in any country and would violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights."</p>
<p>Protesters gathered outside the luxury mansion where Pinochet had been in detention since his arrest in October 1998 on a Spanish warrant.</p>
<p>Journalists and protesters were also camped outside RAF Brize Norton, an air base in Oxfordshire, southern England, where a Chilean air force plane had been on standby for the past month to whisk Pinochet home.</p>
<p>But the plane left the air base shortly after 5:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) Thursday for an unknown destination.</p>
<p>A defence ministry spokesman said: "The plane will be leaving the UK from somewhere else. I cannot tell you from where for security reasons."</p>
<p>Henrika Harkko, a 24-year-old student from Santiago, studying in London, who took part in a candlelit vigil outside Pinochet's villa overnight, said: "We have demonstrated in vain and now he shall never be brought to trial for the torture and murder of our people.</p>
<p>"It's a terrible disappointment for Pinochet's thousands of victims that he will not face trial in Spain," said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>But he added: "The fact that four countries have sought his extradition and that his claim of immunity has been rejected has made the world a smaller place for people who commit atrocities."
