<p><font color="#000099">May 2, 2000<br>
<i>Editors Note:</i><br>
Bert DeLeeuw was killed on May 2, 1990. He was a friend, a co-worker and a kindred spirit. Our lives remain entwined - my wife Lina was married to Bert when he was killed and he is the father of our daughter Chloe.

Bert's passion for life and his commitment to fighting for social and economic justice lives on as inspiration to us all. We wanted to share this article from the Washington Post's archives with you.<br>

<p> 

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He was the essential Washington activist, organizing everything from welfare 
rights protests to the Barry Commoner campaign. Then, still trying to change the 
world, he headed back to the land - and toward a fate no idealism could prepare 
him for.
<p> The pathologist testified that the blast entered at the victim's right posterior 
flank, not dead center in his back, as was commonly thought by the people of Walker 
Township. The weapon was an "over-and-under." Over-and-under is gun lingo for 
a rifle-shotgun combination, which is to say a .222 rifle mounted atop a 20-gauge. 
Hunters often use this model when going for turkey, although some like it for 
deer. The targetlike wound, measuring roughly 14 centimeters in diameter, formed 
a very distinctive pattern of concentric circles -- a kind of smooth, horrid pebbling. 
Although there was probably never any real chance of survival, surgeons at J.C. 
Blair Memorial Hospital labored furiously to remove the pellets for close to two 
hours.
<p> Bert Jay DeLeeuw was pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m.
<p> A life was gone at 44.
<p> It was an explosion that still reverberates, and not just in the closed-in 
blue-green and whale-humped valleys of Huntingdon County, Pa.
<p> It's a tale about dogs, only it's not about dogs.
<p> It's about a person's lifelong 
search for meaning and community, and the place where that search finally led 
him. It's about how we take our fate with us. It's about changing the externals 
of your life without perhaps changing the essentials of your life. It's about 
neighbors in bucolic America gone fatally wrong. It's about urban values against 
rural values. It's about the left against the right. It's about lives seeming 
to go somewhere and other lives (right across the macadam) seeming to go nowhere. 
It's about all those unexplained or unknown or too-complicated forces in the dark 
tunnels of a human heart that can suddenly, on the wrong day in the wrong rage 
in the wrong solstice, take an ugly turn into homicide.
<p> But this is trying to tell the thing in the abstract.
<p> Let it start with the shattering sound itself.
<p> Which happened right about here, on the other side of this leaning fence post, 
in this narrow patch of green along this bowered lane, where the squash and zucchini 
have now long since passed their summer fulfillment. Last May 2, when Bert DeLeeuw was shot in the back by his neighbor, shot in the back at close range by 
a man who'd attended his wedding a year before, who'd been a guest in his home 
the previous New Year's, there was no squash or zucchini or any other kind of 
organic fulfillment in this boxlike strip of rich Pennsylvania earth, only the 
promise of it, just the freshly worked loamy soil of Blue Moon Farm off the Hartslog 
Valley Road.
<p> Setting out new plants in mud-luscious spring, after winter has been wrestled 
to the ground, is one of a farmer's nearly indescribable joys. In this case the 
farmer had been a farmer only five seasons. Once, he'd been a city man, a Washington, 
D.C., man, known not for the beauty of his lettuce but for the zeal of his political 
organizing.
<p> But we'll come to that.
<p> The skeleton of the shooting, according to state police records and court 
transcripts and interviews and other sources, is as follows: About 5:30 on the 
afternoon of the 2nd, 68-year-old Bill Robb -- whose house is just across the 
road from the DeLeeuw place -- eased up in a burgundy sedan. Three other people 
were on their knees, working in the field with DeLeeuw -- his wife, Lina, and 
two out-of-state college-age farmhands named Sally White and Bob Weinswig. Bill 
Robb, native to these environs, had been on the DeLeeuw (pronounced de-LOO) property 
earlier that day, shortly before lunch. He'd been complaining once again and making 
not-so-veiled threats about the seven or eight loose-running dogs the DeLeeuws 
owned. He'd been glowering about how these dogs were running in packs onto his 
land, were scaring his grandchildren, were spooking his horses, were causing a 
total distraction and disruption in his life. He had a book about state game laws, 
and he'd been waving it. He'd been mumbling many things. He hadn't spoken to Bert 
DeLeeuw on that earlier visit, but had instructed one of the young farmhands 
to pass along a message to DeLeeuw that he had just 48 hours to do something.
<p> Before he'd left, Robb had told the farmhand that he'd served his country, 
and that Bert DeLeeuw had done everything not to serve his country. He'd also 
said something about "maybe shooting the dogs too."
<p> Now, though, it was late afternoon that same day, May 2, and the neighbor 
had shown up again at Blue Moon Farm.
<p> On the stand at the preliminary hearing (it was held three weeks later), one 
of the three eyewitnesses testified that, in the penultimate seconds before the 
gun went off, he heard Robb -- who had the weapon up to his shoulder and was squinting 
down its barrel for maybe as much as 10 beats -- say, "I'm really sorry I have 
to make Chloe fatherless."
<p> Chloe DeLeeuw, Bert DeLeeuw and Lina Newhouser's only child, was not quite 
7 months old at that moment. She was up in the main house being tended to by a 
grandparent. The crack from Bill Robb's .222-20 gauge wasn't heard up there.
<p> "He was just pointing it at Bert," testified Bob Weinswig. "And then Bert 
just kind of -- Bert turned around, sort of turned, and just as he turned, not 
to walk away or anything. It was just like he kind of knew. Like just as he turned 
around, Bill shot him in the back and Bert kind of went, you know, down . . ."
<p> Many weeks later, the defendant himself, held in the county jail without bail, 
would vehemently insist to this reporter that the whole thing had been an accident, 
that there had been lots of arguing back and forth about the dogs in those final 
minutes, and that he, Robb, had fired off to the side to scare hell out of his 
neighbor, who'd been making his own threats and threatening moves, and that DeLeeuw just stepped into the shot.
<p> This is known: Lina Newhouser is the one who careened her husband to town 
in their white Datsun pickup, a pickup still bearing a blue sticker on its dented 
bumper: "FARMS NOT ARMS." Lina Newhouser is the one who was standing perhaps four 
or five feet away when her husband -- he was on his feet by then -- turned and 
took a sidelong step or maybe two steps and then seemed to go lurching downward, 
almost in slow motion, into the squash plantings.
<p> Lina Newhouser -- who is from New Orleans, and is 39, and is a single parent 
now -- is the one who screamed in the aftermath for George William Robb to get 
the hell off her property; who ran to the truck and got the watering tank off; 
who pulled and dragged and tried to lift the crumpled, bleeding form; who, along 
with one of the two farmhands, got Bert -- upside down, as it turned out -- into 
the cab of the pickup; who kept repeating, like a mantra in some fantastic dream, 
"This is really a bad joke. This is really a bad joke."
<p> The funeral service was held at Blue Moon Farm four days later. By then most 
of the obituaries, local and otherwise, had appeared. Many made mention of the 
victim's well-to-do beginnings in suburban New Jersey; of his thoughts of the 
ministry during college in Michigan; of his turn toward social work and community 
organizing in graduate school in the late '60s; of his decade and a half spent 
in Washington working for such causes and minority groups as the National Welfare 
Rights Organization and the Movement for Economic Justice. There was mention of 
DeLeeuw's several marriages; of his three or four years as a self-employed carpenter 
after he'd given up working in electoral politics but before he'd left Washington; 
of his earlier roles in three presidential campaigns: George McGovern's ('72), 
Fred Harris's ('76), Barry Commoner's ('80). There was mention of some of the 
more celebrated demonstrations and protests and "actions" he'd participated in 
in his time -- that May 1970 sit-in at the office of Health, Education and Welfare 
Secretary Robert Finch, for instance. That had been one of Bert's best arrests. 
Photos had gone out on all the national wires.
<p> "When you go to jail, it's such a clear, crisp definition of your belief in 
the issue," Bert DeLeeuw told a Washington interviewer in 1984, though that quote 
didn't appear in the death stories.
<p> Actually, the people of Walker Township in Huntingdon County, Pa., were a 
little stunned to learn how their neighbor had done so many things in so short 
a life. They'd known him in an entirely different context.
<p align="center">* * *
<p>The Robin Hood Hotel.
<p>It was a brick row house and it stood at 1735 T St. NW above Dupont Circle 
and there were roses growing in the front yard, and in its own way in its own 
day to its own kind of '70s Washington player it was as famous a place as 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p> It was a haven for anyone to the left who had a cause, the farther to the 
left the better.
<p> New Year's parties there were legend. Didn't need a tie, didn't need a fixed 
address: Come to the Robin Hood Hotel, where Bert and Madeleine lived, where a 
movement kicked off its shoes. Come at 11 and go home at 11 a day later if you 
like.
<p> The place took its name from one of the great welfare rights slogans of the 
early '70s: "Robin Hood was right." There always seemed to be somebody sleeping 
on the sofa who was just in from Berkeley or Ann Arbor or Little Rock.
<p> "He used to make us omelets when we came over -- and hamburger pies," remembers 
one old couch-sleeper at the Robin Hood. "The hamburger pies took up the entire 
skillet and had cheese and peppers and raisins and cashew nuts. He'd bring the 
frying pan over to the table and cut you up a wedge. I think sometimes I remember 
him more for food than I do for causes. The man loved a party."
<p> There was good classical piano in this house. There was good marijuana in 
this house. There was good Ping-Pong in the basement of this house.
<p> Bert DeLeeuw and Madeleine Adamson -- who was his second wife and today lives 
in Baltimore and who is still an organizer for causes on the left -- played host 
to parties at the Robin Hood Hotel from the mid-'70s to the mid-'80s. When they 
bought the house, the price was $29,500. When they put it up for sale, their lives 
and mutual love having gone separate ways, the asking price was $175,000. The 
space between those two figures seems almost a time line between what a city was, 
when an activist felt at home here, and what a city became, or seemed to become, 
when an activist called the town quits and sought to reinvent his life, though 
not his values, in the shadow of Tussey Mountain in rural Pennsylvania on a broken-down 
piece of property that offered 100 acres of woods, 50 acres of tillable fields, 
good pasture land, two cold streams and some very promising structures.
<p> All you had to have was the zeal. That's one of the things people always tell 
you now about Bert DeLeeuw: He could go at a new idea like a man killing snakes. 
Once he'd refound the dream, there was one gear: fast forward.
<p> When the Robin Hood Hotel closed its doors in early 1984, when two people 
were closing up their marriage as well, a party was held. Champagne was uncorked. 
The food, as always, was something. The printed invitations had proclaimed the 
event "The end of an era," and maybe it was. The specially made buttons announced 
that it was the end of an era too. What would the protest movement of the '60s 
and '70s have been without buttons? Every action always had to have a button. 
Not to mention media: The Post's Style section did a major story.

<p> Bert DeLeeuw made a fine toast at the close-down of the Robin Hood and of 
his second marriage. He was already with his new love, Lina, just as Madeleine, 
his ex, was already with hers. There was a sense of separate peace that day, and 
maybe not just among the divorcing two.
<p> "Living stripped of all its facets . . . reduces down to relationships," he 
said in his toast. "That's why this house has been so important to me. We've had 
parties, we've had meetings, we've had block associations." And then he said, 
"I am a socialist. It's because society is based on collectivity and interpersonal 
relationships that capitalism will fail."
<p> Two years later, almost to the day, Bert DeLeeuw and Lina Newhouser, proprietors 
of a struggling organic farm in central Pennsylvania, wrote a holiday letter to 
their family and friends and old common causers back in Washington. It was supposed 
to be a New Year's message, but characteristically got sent out a bit late -- 
near the end of January.
<p> "Our life here as producers -- getting our hands dirty and our backs tired 
-- is one we look forward to, as it places us squarely in the heart of our new 
community and provides a context for our political, cultural, and intellectual 
aspirations and activities," the pilgrim farmers wrote. "We especially hope that, 
over the distances that separate us, we will be able to share in the struggle 
to create societies that honor peace over militarism, liberation over oppression, 
collective enterprise over greed."
<p> One of the co-signers of the letter would have a little over four years and 
four months to pursue that dream . . . From court transcripts at the preliminary 
hearing:
<p> Q. I'm curious. You heard a horse. Did you see a horse?
<p> A. No, no, no. And Bert said that Mr. Robb has a tape recording of his horse 
which he plays down the road just to bother the dogs. They were all barking and 
we told them to calm down and stop. We kept working and we heard a car coming 
down the road and it was Mr. Robb's red Oldsmobile. And he said to me, he said, 
did you give Mr. DeLeeuw my message. I said -- I mean, Mr. DeLeeuw was, you 
know, 20 feet away from me. Heard him say this. I just didn't really understand 
the point of responding. And so he pulled up his car a little more and he was 
still in it and he's like, Mr. DeLeeuw, and he said that a couple times, you 
know, Mr. DeLeeuw. And, you know, Bert's sitting there trying to work because 
I guess Mr. Robb would come by quite often. We're all sitting there trying to 
work and he's saying stuff like, you don't respect me. You don't respect anyone. 
He's like, that's not true, Bert said. You know, I do respect you, you know, and 
he's still working in the ground and --
<p> Q. Is Mr. Robb still in the car?
<p> A. Yeah. Mr. Robb's still in the car. And then he said stuff like, about the 
dogs; said you made a big mistake. And he started getting out of the car and he 
pulled out this big shotgun, and he was holding it down at his waist and he was 
pointing it at him.
<p> Q. Pointing it at who?
<p> A. It was just kind of down there. He was standing out overlooking the field 
and he says some stuff about making a big mistake and he just kept kind of say- 
ing the same stuff over. Bert and Lina were like, Bill, put the gun away. He {DeLeeuw} kind of stood up now because he {Robb} pulled out this gun. He kept saying, 
Bill, put the gun away. Put the gun away, Bill.
<p align="center">* * *
<p> "He was dead already," the small, 
muscular woman is saying.
<p>"I think he died immediately, within seconds. They spent 
a long time trying to revive him, you know."
<p> And then, with a kind of perfect empty brightness, as if to cover all the 
horror she is feeling, Lina Newhouser says, "I said to myself, 'Gee, I've got 
to hurry and get Bert to the hospital.' So I just stuffed him in and drove away."
<p> She's bouncing her sleepy-eyed yellow-haired baby daughter on her knee. Chloe 
DeLeeuw's just up from a nap.
<p> A moment ago she had said, "Well, in a sense, I think his parents are surviving 
in the same way I am, by keeping extremely busy. Just bring it up and watch them, 
you know, shatter before your eyes."
<p> She has tawny skin and short-cropped black hair. There seems something impish 
and elfin and ingenue-ish about her -- for all her toughness and pain and savvy, 
for all the bloodshot in her eyes this afternoon. She's an artist by education 
and sensibility, though it was always art that sought to intersect at the angle 
of radical, or at least liberal, politics. She once worked, in Washington and 
other places, for an activist group known as ACORN: the Association of Community 
Organizations for Reform Now.
<p> She once opened an exhibit in a laundromat in Hoboken, N.J. It was a series 
of pieces about clothes on clotheslines.
<p> People tell you now that Lina Newhouser expanded Bert's horizons, made him 
less inclined to see the world through political eyeglasses. People also tell 
you she made the last several years of his life among the happiest he'd ever known. 
Fatherhood must have helped in this too, though the fatherhood was so short-lived.
<p> "I started spending time with him in 1980," she is saying. "We were both coming 
out of other relationships. His second marriage was starting to break up. He hired 
me to work at Citizens' Party."
<p> On the wall behind her head in this messy but still somehow elegant Civil 
War-era split-log farmhouse is a large poster. It says "VOTE CITIZENS' PARTY 1980" 
and it's inscribed, "For Bert -- who made the obviously impossible not only possible 
but worth doing." Barry Commoner wrote the words. Bert DeLeeuw managed the Commoner 
campaign on the road, disastrous as that campaign was, at least at the polling 
booth. Bert was the keeper of the body, was the one you had to talk to first. 
For the last weeks of the campaign, when everybody seemed mostly to be going through 
motions, the campaign manager had gone out and bought a cream-colored linen suit: 
class. He may have never had any money in his life, but DeLeeuw had style and 
class. People say he knew wines the way baseball people know box scores. He was 
the original counterculture man with the gourmet's palate.
<p> Today Lina Newhouser is wearing khaki shorts, with woolen sweat socks rolled 
down around her ankles. The measure of her anger seems the precise measure of 
her fragility. This is the second visit to the farm by a reporter in a week's 
time, and in the first, Lina -- you pronounce it Line-uh -- had been able to speak 
only around the events of May 2, 1990, not really of them. This visit you get 
a sense of her odd eggshell toughness just in the way she shakes hands: When it's 
time to let go, she doesn't. And yet in her need to hang on, there also seems 
a great strength.
<p> "We bought it on the summer solstice," she is saying. "There was a blue moon 
that year. We just liked the name. It makes you think of different things. 'Blue 
Moon . . . ' " She breaks off the tiniest hum.
<p> On the inside of a cabinet on the far wall are some 8x10 photos: of a shag-haired 
and wire-rimmed youthful-looking man being dragged toward a District of Columbia 
paddy wagon; of a brown-lung protest, complete with signs and bullhorns; of a 
clean-cut Jersey kid from the '50s getting a ballplayer's autograph in Yankee 
Stadium. There's also a picture of a former president with this under it: "Best 
wishes to Bert DeLeeuw. Jimmy Carter."
<p> All of it must be so long ago -- anything past May 2, 1990, must be so long 
ago. Today, Lina and the help were out in the fields picking by 7:30. They used 
baskets and boxes and got lettuce, eggplant, onions, kale, collard greens. They 
worked straight through till lunch at 2. Some of the harvested produce will be 
sold Friday at the Huntingdon farmers market (which Bert and Lina helped establish); 
other of it will be put on a co-op truck and taken down to Washington, 3 1/2 hours 
distant, and delivered to tony restaurants and to organically minded Georgetowners. 
The DeLeeuw farm is part of a co-op called the Tuscarora Organic Growers.
<p> "We're having, ironically, a good season," she says. "The weather has been 
very cooperative. That's one of the sad, sad ironies. We were getting everything 
in place without any more . . . large capital expenditures."
<p> This is the least reference to a hard ongoing fact: She and her husband always 
had to scrabble for seed money -- literally for seed money. Everything was on 
the come. That's how farming is, especially when you're doing it organically and 
just starting out and have put nearly everything you have into the purchase of 
the property. Bert and Lina borrowed from banks, from family, from farm credit 
unions. The question was always: Can we last another two or three or four seasons 
until we turn the corner?
<p> "We would have turned the corner," she says.
<p> Her head is wrapped in a faded pink kerchief. On the back of her T-shirt is 
the word "Unbelizable," which has something to do with the Central American country 
bordering the Caribbean where two people fast in love once spent six months, bronzing 
their bodies, snorkeling and fishing for snappers and grunts. The Belize interlude 
was shortly before the flight from urbanity, when Bert DeLeeuw and Lina Newhouser 
were thinking hard about what the next step would be. Ronald Reagan's America 
wasn't their America. There didn't seem to be much point anymore to the kind of 
work they'd been doing, at least no longer any point to doing it in Washington. 
"Whither the left?" you might describe their mind-set then. Whither Bert and Lina? 
The answer turned out to be Blue Moon Farm, which wasn't even a name, just a gleam, 
sitting across from the rolling property of Bill Robb, a onetime letter carrier 
they would end up knowing well, and being quite neighborly with, for a time.
<p> Again, quoting from that first New Year's letter in the proud, new, dilapidated 
home: "Here on the farm we've been busy fixing the barn, rebuilding the spring 
house, canning fruits and vegetables, painting, clearing the pear orchard, weeding 
the garden, installing a heating system (wood furnace), and tearing down old plaster 
walls to expose the log walls of our house."
<p> "We weren't dropping out," Lina is saying now. "It's much more complex than 
that. Bert wasn't burned out. He was definitely shifting gears, that's true. He 
was definitely tired. He didn't want to do electoral politics anymore. I think 
he was trying to rethink the whole idea of community. What we wanted in a community. 
In all his organizing, he was working on the same idea. Empowering people."
<p> If he'd left the old life with any sense of embitterment, she never knew it, 
she says.
<p> Bert loved taking first-time visitors from the city out into the fields. He'd 
rhapsodize on his plantings, hell, he'd practically bore people to tears with 
the minutiae of his new life. It was the same as organizing, he'd tell his friends: 
impossible hours, endless lists, a need to stay on top of a thousand details. 
Only here you got tangible results.
<p> Sometimes, when guests from Manhattan or Washington were at the farm and had 
met the neighbor from across the road, they'd ask Bert after the old guy was gone, 
"What's his problem, exactly?" And Bert's answer would surprisingly be something 
like this: "Don't be fooled. He's a lot smarter than you think. He went to college. 
He'll quote you the Constitution."
<p> Bert enjoyed having Bill Robb over, Lina says. That's what you do with neighbors. 
Sure, the guy talked a lot. For that matter, Bert talked a lot.
<p> They dug their compost. They recycled their glass. They refused plastic bags 
at the supermarket. They joined a film series at the local college. A season later, 
Lina, without her husband knowing it, took small amounts from their market cash 
box each week, and when November came round, she took the money into town and 
bought two tickets on Amtrak for a Christmastime tour across the country.
<p> Why weren't we always living this life? two people asked themselves. In almost 
no time, it seemed, Bert had become a kind of spokesperson for the township. Once, 
when someone asked Bert, the city boy, how it was he thought he could turn himself 
into an organic farmer, he replied, "Why, it never really occurred to us we couldn't 
do this."
<p> "Bert served as a township supervisor here," she is saying. "He was very proud 
of that. I think it paid a hundred and twenty-five a month."
<p> And then: "He liked being a leader up here. He was accepted here. We were 
accepted here."
<p> Although they were together on and off for about the last 10 years of Bert's 
life, and together permanently from the middle of the decade, the two decided 
to marry only at the end of the '80s. The wedding date was May 28, 1989.
<p> "Partly, I suppose, because we were going to have a baby," she says. "It's 
hard to put into words. Partly because it was right for this time in our lives. 
And then, too, right for our place in this community."
<p> It was an outdoor wedding, with a pitched tent and wonderful food. There was 
an air of community picnic. The groom was open-collared and had his hair neatly 
brushed and he wore a batik patchwork vest. His bride looked like the prettiest 
girl in some hilltop Mexican village. One of the guests who made a toast that 
day -- it rambled on, something to do with the pleasures of taking drink on the 
occasion of two people getting hitched -- was the neighbor from across the road. 
Bill Robb came to the party with a suit and a cane. He was very jovial. He danced 
with several young female guests up from the city. "Oh, are you one of their commie 
friends?" he joshed to one of his dance partners, trying to waltz.
<p> Blue veins are sawing brightly up Lina Newhouser's neck. She is bobbing her 
child. Her face is cracking.
<p> And she says: "These dogs never attacked a person. Yes, they could attack 
other dogs if they came up, or could bark like crazy at people riding horses. 
Dogs do that. We had dogs in the first place to keep off the deer from eating 
our vegetables."
<p> And she says: "I mean, why didn't he shoot the dogs if he had to shoot something? 
Of course. That would have been too rational."
<p> And she says: "We cut Bill Robb a lot of slack over the years. We tried to 
respect what there was to respect about Bill Robb."
<p> And she says, still bobbing her child, chewing at her lip, nodding tightly, 
crying now in spite of herself: "Yes. Yes. Pretty angry, I'm pretty damn angry."
<p> The last thing Lina Newhouser says she can remember hearing the neighbor man 
say before he pulled the trigger was, "Sorry about that, old buddy."
<p> Old buddy. People in this township and in this county tell you that is a pure 
Robbism . . . Bill Robb had been drinking that day, though how hard isn't precisely 
known. Before the shooting, according to a state trooper's lengthy reports, Robb 
said to his wife, Vera, "I guess I'll have to go up there and shoot either Bert 
or the dogs." When Vera tried to remonstrate with him, she later told authorities, 
he pointed a revolver at her head.
<p> After the shooting, the state troopers came for him at his place. Vera was 
out in the yard, hiding behind a tree. The accused man emerged, with small unsteadiness, 
in his suspenders and baggy pants and slight growth of Wednesday whisker and said, 
according to arresting officer Wayne Gibson, "I shot him. I killed Bert." Bill 
Robb would spout many things in the next several hours. Robb's affect seemed all 
wrong that night, bizarrely out of place -- in the squad car on the way to the 
arraignment before the district magistrate; in the fingerprinting session; during 
the alcohol testing period. According to the troopers and the district attorney 
and even the man appointed public defender in this case, Robb just gibbered on. 
They couldn't shut him up. It almost seemed as if he loved the attention he was 
suddenly getting. Far from showing remorse or fear or confusion, Robb appeared 
wholly satisfied with what his over-and-under had accomplished. That, or not really 
comprehending of it. At one point, he said to the arresting officer, "I wanted 
to shoot him with something that would do the job."

<p>Snapshots Of A Life:
<p>Bert 
Jay DeLeeuw is born on August 16, 1945, in a Hackensack, N.J., hospital. His 
parents, Bert Sr. and Evelyn -- thrifty, hard-working, churchgoing, Dutch-descended 
-- derive his middle name from the just-celebrated V-J Day. He is the firstborn 
in a family of four children, each child with a distinctly -- almost radically 
-- different personality. For instance, the next to come along in this family 
is Bill. Bert and Bill are just 17 months apart. Bill DeLeeuw grows up with the 
strangest knack for being able to rub 50 cents in his palms and make it come out 
5 bucks -- while his older brother always has trouble just finding the 50 cents. 
Bill DeLeeuw becomes a Nixon Republican, a San Diego real estate baron, a sailing 
partner of Dennis Conner, a mogul estimated to be worth $30-odd million -- conservatively 
speaking.
<p> These two oldest boys will never be close -- and for a time will seem to despise 
each other's values -- but they are always fierce tennis and Ping-Pong rivals. 
(In the early evening hours of May 2, Bill DeLeeuw is the one who must break 
the news to his aging parents. The parents are in Las Vegas, making their way 
back across the country after a winter in California. The second son flies to 
Nevada, finds his folks in the lobby of Circus Circus. "Let's go upstairs, I have 
something to tell you," he says.)
<p> The head of this nuclear Jersey family of six, Bert DeLeeuw Sr., is a small, 
practical, modest, affable and self-taught American businessman. Later in life 
he will be known as "Mr. Fixit" for his willingness to help repair his neighbors' 
leaky faucets and fouled spark plugs. Bert Sr. is co-owner of a Bergen County 
machine plant. After the war, he and a few friends buy an old building and fill 
it with junk parts. Over the next decade they turn a shop into a plant. Rochelle 
Plastic Mold Co. makes precision steel molds for plastic parts. Bert Sr. works 
at the plant six days a week, but never on Sunday. Sunday is the Lord's day. This 
is a Christian Reformed family, and that is sacred.
<p> A reporter brings up the word "community." Evelyn DeLeeuw says, "Yes, and 
I can tell you where it came from. It came from an organized family that always 
had their meals together. And, by the way, anybody was welcome in this house."
<p> Starting out in Rochelle Park, a less affluent area of Bergen County, the 
DeLeeuws move to Wyckoff, more upscale. The DeLeeuws never flaunt what they 
have; that wouldn't conform to their religious principles. Bert Jr. attends Passaic 
Christian School, Eastern Christian Junior High, Eastern Christian High. At all 
of these he is a leader and achiever, especially at the last: captain of the tennis 
team, member of the student council, runner on the cross-country squad. He seems 
singularly uninterested in the world of commerce, in fact, seems uninterested 
in money at all except as you must have it to live. This seems not a rejection 
of his father so much as an embrace of his paternal grandfather. Peter DeLeeuw, 
who'd arrived in America from Holland at age 12 and never got higher than a school 
janitor, was known all over this part of Jersey for his Christian humanitarian 
work. Peter DeLeeuw, the old impecunious Dutchman, had a nonsensical rhyme: "There 
was a man, they called him mad/ The more he gave, the more he had."
<p> Summers, the DeLeeuws go to Green Pond, 50 minutes west of exurbia. Green 
Pond is a long and skinny and crystal-clear spring-fed lake where old wooden Chris-Crafts 
and Republican money lie at anchor. Originally a Methodist camp, the pond has 
turned itself into a summer colony for doctors and  lawyers 
and wealthy funeral parlor owners. It's not the richness or exclusivity of, say, 
Upper Saddle River, but it's private and beautiful and family-oriented.
<p> There are four red clay tennis courts at the Green Pond Yacht Club. During 
summers, Bert Jr. gets a job as the club's teaching pro. Part of his responsibility 
is maintaining the courts; he embraces this duty almost religiously. Some days 
he's out as early as 6 a.m., rolling and sweeping and putting the calcium down. 
Some nights he's still out at 10, shining headlights on the playing surface to 
see what he's doing.
<p> In 1963, which of course is the year JFK is assassinated in Dallas, the eldest 
DeLeeuw son enrolls as a pre-seminarian at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
He is thinking of going into the service of the church, but by his second year 
he has decided that community organizing, not the ministry, is his real vocation. 
"That's what I got out of my religious back- ground," he'll tell a reporter profiling 
him in 1984. " 'The least of those among you.' That was the notion of what Christianity 
was supposed to be about -- helping other people."
<p> He majors in sociology, marries his high school sweetheart, relocates to Ann 
Arbor. It's the fall of 1967, and Vietnam is no longer that tidy little one-column 
firefight most of the early New Frontiersmen figured it for. He enters the University 
of Michigan's graduate School of Social Work. By now he has adopted his life's 
uniform: denim shirts and pants, wire-rims, semi-disheveled hair, the occasional 
wrinkled corduroy coat. His marriage is fraying at the edges, though his parents 
don't know this.
<p> He gets arrested in a campus protest -- the cause is long forgotten -- and 
mails the gang in Jersey a picture of it. A pattern is forming. Years hence this 
pattern will be defined by his second wife as "the agitational response." Which 
is to say: Bert DeLeeuw enjoyed putting it in their faces, whoever they were, 
letting them deal with it, whatever it was. Not necessarily to be mean, mind you. 
But to get their attention.
<p> And yet this wasn't a loud or demonstrative or hubristic or showy person, 
certainly not in these years.
<p> Evelyn DeLeeuw: "I guess we could never really understand his political thinking. 
We couldn't understand, for instance, why he wanted to go off and get arrested. 
That seemed so foreign to us. After he was living in Washington and working for 
the causes of civil rights and so forth, he told us he couldn't really come up 
here anymore, that people up here didn't understand him. But, you know, now I 
think that just about everything he was doing down there in those years was religious."
<p> Bert DeLeeuw Sr.: "He was certainly doing good work and all. But, I don't 
know, it was as if he was doing the opposite of what we thought he should be doing. 
I guess we just thought he'd never be able to make a living at it. I guess it 
made us mad. I guess it made us anxious. I guess we felt that Bert's work was, 
you know, kind of driving a wedge in his marriage."
<p> In 1968, the eldest son arranges to work as an intern in Washington, D.C. 
It's the summer of Resurrection City and the Poor People's Campaign, of Grant 
Park in Chicago. Bert meets a charismatic black man named George Wiley. Wiley, 
head of the fledgling welfare rights movement in America, is a world-class chemistry 
professor turned advocate of the lowest sector of poor. He sees economic issues 
as the key to all civil rights. He has one blinding insight: Bring the "ladies," 
which is to say the welfare mothers themselves, smack into the middle of the movement. 
That is, put up front what other black civil rights leaders think of as absolutely 
the wrong images.
<p> It's not altogether inaccurate to say that the tennis-playing upper-middle-class 
kid from conservative white Bergen County, who has somehow grafted onto himself 
his grandfather's conscience, fairly comes to worship the black Washington laureate 
of mothers on welfare.
<p> "We all wanted to raise hell," Bert will say in that same 1984 profile, looking 
back on the time when he first found his activist fire. "There was just something 
about the times, I guess. We wanted to go out and organize! We wanted to feel 
that we were going to do something about the massive inequality in poor people 
versus non-poor people in society."
<p> Anyway, he returns to Michigan, completes his master's, comes back to Washington 
the following summer to begin working full time for George Wiley and the movement. 
Over the next years, there are many protests. All those hard-to-describe organizing 
skills are being deftly acquired. There's an extensive protest in Las Vegas that 
lasts six weeks; Sammy Davis Jr. and Ralph Abernathy and Jane Fonda and other 
celebrities arrive to help. Bert gets his pic in Life magazine.
<p> Bert DeLeeuw, now George Wiley's most trusted aide, his second in command, 
a kind of chief of staff to a movement, is becoming known far and wide as the 
guy with the phone numbers. He can get Gloria Steinem. If you have to get through 
to Jane Fonda, that's Bert. He can work Washington. He can talk to the Hill, to 
lawyers, to the ladies. It's all behind the scenes, which is not to say he's not 
capable of getting out front with the bullhorn.
<p> The first marriage dissolves. Madeleine Adamson, a beautiful student at American 
University, has entered the picture. Madeleine turns up at the National Welfare 
Rights Organization offices at 14th and H NW to answer telephones and run a mimeo 
copier, and, well, love just follows.
<p> In 1972, Bert takes time off from welfare rights work to help with George 
McGovern's run for the presidency. Ever the idealist and optimist, he writes long 
impassioned letters to his beloved -- who's sojourning in Europe that fall -- 
telling her that McGovern is going to get elected. "My batting average is not 
too good on these political campaigns," DeLeeuw will say years later, "but my 
conscience is clear."
<p> The marriage of Madeleine and Bert comes shortly after the '72 election. It's 
held at the AU chapel. The printed-up buttons proclaim: "Legalize Madeleine and 
Bert." There's a big dinner at the Yenching Palace on Connecticut Avenue. The 
house on T Street becomes the Robin Hood Hotel. Bert always seems to be talking 
about "CDBGs": Community Development Block Grants. That's the key, he thinks. 
He loves going to Childe Harold and the Admiral Benbow and Food for Thought. One 
night, at one or another of these places, he bulbs with another kind of CDBG: 
Block T Street off so that the Metrobuses can't come down. Metrobuses are an intrusion 
on his sense of community. His idea is that everybody on his block will get out 
and human-barricade the street. It'll be a kind of party. At length, there's a 
peaceful rerouting of the buses, which is a disappointment in its own way.
<p> Well, you get the picture: other causes, other electoral battles, other jailings, 
other alienations, other protests -- by the score. Many of these causes fail, 
at least if you're trying to tabulate results in a won-lost column. A decade swims 
on. A man still has the capacity to work like he's killing snakes. The charismatic 
George Wiley has now drowned in a terrible accident on the Chesapeake Bay. Bert 
and Madeleine, in their grief, throw themselves into a new organization called 
the Movement for Economic Justice. The MEJ was George Wiley's last dream. Bert 
tries to carry on Wiley's idea of an umbrella organization that will bring together 
all the various strains and subshoots of community groups working for the poor 
across America.
<p> MEJ folds its tent in 1976. It's not so much a lack of funds as a lack of 
harmony. Political organizing, especially on the left, is a very egotistical business, 
and much of the ego and infighting seems to arise from one cold fact: You're always 
dealing with an intangibility of product. And besides, down deep, lefties know 
they're never going to win. There are too many on the other side. Hence the internal 
turf wars.
<p> Actually, the rise of ego is one of the things in these later years of the 
'70s that people seem to be noticing about Bert DeLeeuw. But he is far from an 
egomaniac. And he still keeps the old dreams intact, more than you can say for 
some. They haven't made "The Big Chill" in Hollywood yet, but the Big Chill tenor 
of the times is coming fast on the inside.
<p> Bert had been so certain that Fred Harris of Oklahoma had a real chance at 
the presidency in '76. People say his defeat slowed him up only momentarily.
<p> The Commoner campaign of '80 comes and goes. Before the infighting gets too 
unbearable, Bert serves as director of the Citizens' Party. He isn't averse to 
stopping in at Green Pond with a klatch of Commoner advance types who spill drinks 
on his parents' rug and run up large cross-country bills on Bert and Evelyn's 
phone. This angers Bert and Evelyn, but characteristically they never say enough's 
enough. He is their son, maybe they don't really understand him, but he will always 
be welcome.
<p> After the Commoner campaign, exhausted, the eldest son turns to self-employed 
carpentry. He's still living at the Robin Hood Hotel, but he and Madeleine have 
drawn apart. It turns out that an apprentice carpenter has amazing hand skills 
-- anybody who ever played across a tennis net from him might have told you this. 
But now Bert puts in kitchens with wondrous dexterity, builds beautiful cabinets, 
does the grunt work of roofing. He has never made more than $12,000 in a single 
year, and these days his political arguments come while he's waiting for materials 
at the discount lumber yards. You wouldn't call him unhappy. What you'd probably 
call him is in between. Waiting for the next step.
<p> "It's all honest work," he'll later say of this period. "The one thing I didn't 
want to do, and don't ever want to do, is sell my soul for the sake of doing something."
<p> In the early '80s, about to come over the top of 40 years old, Bert Jay DeLeeuw eyes paper napkins with loathing, loves the LL Bean catalogue, can still 
turn a piece of salmon into an eating experience. And perhaps this could be said 
as well: A committed and perhaps too idealistic son of the torn '60s has spent 
most of his grown-up life trying to replicate -- possibly without even knowing 
-- the fundamental decency and bonding of the home he had no other choice but 
to leave behind . . . Bill Robb was still standing with his gun above the patch 
alongside the lane as Lina and one of the farmhands tried to get Bert into the 
pickup. Then the neighbor went over to his car and started up the engine and drove 
down the lane, not toward his own house but toward the DeLeeuw barns and farmhouse. 
He made a U-turn. He was on his way back down the lane, still driving slowly, 
just as Lina pulled out across the field. You could have almost called it comical: 
the two vehicles meeting at that second. Robb slowed down even more, as if to 
give a lady the right of way. Lina gunned the pickup on down the lane while Robb 
went across the pavement to his own place. 
<p align="center">* * *
<p>Something people in Huntindon County 
and elsewhere are very curious about now is the extent of the dog squabble: How 
long did it go on? Lina Newhouser says she isn't really sure herself, though she 
thinks several weeks. For much of that time, she stresses, she was in the house, 
tending Chloe. She didn't take part in this year's planting season nearly as much 
as in other years. But in any case, the dog issue was never something she and 
Bert were taking very seriously, she says. Yes, it's true her husband had put 
shock collars on several of the dogs to try to keep them on his property. He was 
aware there was a potential problem. But, really, wasn't all this fuss and feather 
about the dogs just Bill, his latest kick, blowing hard about something?
<p> Bill Robb tested legally drunk the night he was picked up. But this fact, 
when it got out, wasn't very surprising to to a lot of people in Walker Township. 
There is one DWI conviction on Robb's record, though people tell you now -- heck, 
the district attorney tells you -- it's a little hard to believe there's only 
the one. What is absolutely flattening to the people of the township is that this 
garrulous old man, this former rural postman who had been in their midst all their 
lives, this harmless blowhard whom you'd generally prefer to step across the street 
from rather than having to stop and listen to, would have ever turned up as a 
defendant in a criminal homicide case. Nobody pegged Bill Robb for that role.
<p> The district attorney of Huntingdon County, after studying the case, thinks 
it's pretty much an open and shut instance of the ravages of alcohol. His name 
is Stewart Kurtz. He's a lifelong Huntingdon boy -- and nobody's fool. He's lived 
in cities and likes the country better. He's known Bill Robb practically as far 
back as he can remember. His cousin Butch used to hunt out at Robb's place.
<p> Kurtz believes the case is purely the result of Robb's drinking. "Bill Robb 
is a drinker, and . . . he killed," Kurtz says. "I don't know if atrophy applies. 
I do have indications of a personality change in the previous six months leading 
up to this. He'd been behaving badly; his personality seemed to be shifting to 
a semi-violent state. He was a character, you know. Everybody knew him. He was 
a mail carrier. People know mail carriers."
<p> Kurtz doesn't particularly want to try this case; it involves a native son, 
after all. But he'll try it, that is, if it should actually come to trial, which 
is still something of an open question. A plea to a lesser charge, say, murder 
in the third degree, may be worked out between all parties -- which might also, 
as a side benefit, enable Lina Newhouser to go forward with a wrongful death civil 
suit against the Robb family. (Robb is reported to be holding a huge homeowner's 
insurance policy; if he should be found guilty of premeditated first-degree murder, 
the insurance company would in all probability balk at paying.) Psychiatric evaluations 
of the defendant are now being conducted by a doctor in Pittsburgh, although Kurtz 
emphasizes that under Pennsylvania legal codes it would seem next to impossible 
for Robb to be judged insane. Right now Robb is charged with criminal homicide, 
an umbrella term in Pennsylvania that covers everything from murder one down to 
involuntary manslaughter. The trial is currently scheduled for the court term 
opening January 7.
<p> Stew Kurtz feels that if his jury were being made up of people in Walker Township, 
he could probably get a conviction inside of 30 minutes. The jury, however, will 
be drawn from other parts of the county.
<p> From a strictly courtroom standpoint, the DA feels this isn't a tough case 
at all. "We have these eyewitnesses. Hell, you see him arrive. You see him pull 
the gun, testify to his statements, you see him pull the trigger." The outcome 
of the trial may turn on the question of specific intent. Kurtz is a little concerned 
right now that the public defender in the case might try to mount some kind of 
self-defense argument.
<p> One of the explanations on the streets of Huntingdon -- "Welcome to Huntingdon, 
Our Home, Our Town," says the sign when you come in -- is that an old embittered 
man, a local butt, had gone off his cracker, and that if it hadn't been Bert, 
it might have been his own wife or son or daughter-in-law, and that indeed maybe 
Bert DeLeeuw became the victim by proxy. It's as if in the absence of more hard 
fact, speculation has become the form of solace.
<p> Fred Gutshall, the public defender, is another home-grown boy, down Mount 
Union way, also nobody's fool, and also a man who'd probably rather have another 
assignment but isn't shrinking from this one. "I am a little old-fashioned in 
that I believe a person is innocent until proven guilty," he says. "Everyone has 
prejudged Mr. Robb. But he has his right to his day in court like anybody else. 
You talk to Robb, you'll hear a different story. Bert DeLeeuw had these dogs. 
There was a conflict there."
<p> Asked about all the talking Robb did after the shooting, Gutshall says, "I 
personally feel he was in shock that night." Asked whether he might use alcohol 
im- pairment as a defense, Gutshall replies, "That's certainly possible. But alcohol 
itself is not a defense, never has been. You can't say, 'My client was drunk.' 

That's just not a defense in Pennsylvania."
<p> There are 136 churches in Huntingdon County, and homicide isn't a regular 
subject of the Sunday homily. And yet this oddity: Four homicide cases, Robb's 
being the most celebrated, are now awaiting disposition in the county. You'd have 
to go back to 1830 to beat that record, the locals say . . . As soon as Robb got 
out of his car, Sally White, the other young farmhand who'd come to Blue Moon 
for the '90 growing and harvest season, began walking away. Sally got behind a 
tree. The dogs surrounded her, wagging their tails. Going down, Bert fell on his 
side. His hands went up to his chest. He turned over. He seemed to be digging 
with his feet in a kind of half-circle. "Oh oh oh," he cried, little toots of 
breath blowing out of him.
<p> Then, nothing.
<p align="center">* * *
<p>Three Voices For A Victim:
<p> Wretha Hanson, proprietor of the Franz Bader Gallery, former wife of George 
Wiley, someone who knew Bert DeLeeuw almost from the first day he arrived in 
Washington in the summer of 1968: "He was unusual for the movement, really. Activists 
tend to be opinionated. Assertive, if not outright aggressive. They love to argue, 
they have high energy. Bert had all the commitment of the classic activist but 
not the classic temperament. I think of him essentially in those early years as 
quiet. That's the word that most sticks. He was capable of the kind of consuming 
attention the movement required . . . Whatever expressions of ego and assertiveness 
you get in the later Bert DeLeeuw, I still say -- compared to what? I do think 
that as these losses mounted, then the personal needs increased. You see, as long 
as things in the movement were going reasonably well and you could take some measure 
of satisfaction in what you were doing -- certainly not a payoff in terms of money 
or influence -- you didn't need the 'I.' But as the movement fails, as there doesn't 
really seem a place for you here anymore, the needs for personal assertiveness 
seem to grow larger. At least this is what makes sense to me. And it may not be 
that at all. I'm just making this up, really. I never saw Bert behave in ways 
I couldn't understand. And I miss him terribly."
<p> Randall DeLeeuw, Manhattan graphic artist, third of the four DeLeeuw children, 
the sibling closest in spirit and companionship to the eldest child: "Actually, 
I was more counterculture than he was. I came along four years later. With us, 
it was lifestyle, not political stance. With Bert's generation, it was counterculture 
with the strong political orientation . . . I remember there was this loft in 
New York. It belonged to a woman friend of Bert's. He was between marriages, I 
guess. We all used to stay there, and in this one period he'd been staying there 
for a couple weeks or longer, and anyway he came out to Green Pond, and, well, 
this loft was absolutely crawling with cockroaches, and here's my mother, Evelyn, 
just aghast that he'd brought home all these damn roaches . . . I think it's true 
Bert sometimes lost his peripheral vision. Maybe he could be a little self-righteous 
at times. I think sometimes his idealism just got in the way of -- what? Life. 
But then, after the argument was over, there'd be Ping-Pong down in the basement, 
the breaking out of the beers. That was one of the best things about him. He could 
get over it."
<p> Jim Crawford, organic guru of a group of Washingtonians who've gone to Pennsylvania 
to work the earth. Crawford's been farming without pesticides since the early 
'70s. He only knew the later Bert, the more aggressive Bert: "If he grew lettuce 
one time, then he was the definitive lettuce grower. That was definitely one of 
his prime traits. Acting and being an expert on whatever he was involved in. Really, 
he was an expert. He could pull it off. Yeah, you could resent his confidence 
at times. Yeah, you could sometimes think he was an egomaniac. But, I don't know, 
it was . . . forgivable. You just liked the guy. Despite the ego, he was always 
willing to change his opinion. Making a consensus, that was Bert. It's hard to 
explain somebody like that. Because he had this big ego and was very opinionated, 
but, I don't know, he had a way of not confronting you at the same time. So, okay, 
here's this young guy with so much talent who comes into this abandoned old
place that had never been anything, and he starts to improve it. And this 
other guy has to watch all this success, watch him get elected to the township, 
people loving him and praising him. This guy across the road is filled with resentment 
against everyone. And here your neighbor's just gotten married and has this beautiful 
child and here are all these beautiful crops coming in. And he just can't stand 
it. You know, I think the dog thing just focused Robb." At the end of last May, 
right after the preliminary hearing, a letter was received at the offices of the 
Altoona Mirror, the region's largest newspaper. It was an odd letter, and you 
would have sworn it was written by an illiterate person. There were half-sentences 
and unfinished thoughts. The letter was sent to a reporter who'd been making inquiries 
into the story.
<p> "As you may have heard, I killed a man accidental as he ran into where I was 
shooting to scare hell out of him," the letter writer said. "This is unbelievable 
I could walk or Vera on the back fields and woods, which regularly did, till this 
pack became killers . . ." The letter went on for a while in this vein, and included 
talk about a person "who flies the red flag in May."
<p> It was signed George W. Robb. 
<p align="center">* * *
<p>He has thin dark wet hair combed straight back. 
He has thick greasy spectacles. He has pale hands, with slender and almost ladylike 
fingers that you might guess once held bundles of letters, but certainly not post-hole 
diggers. He has on white tennies, no socks, loose-fitting trousers, a blue prison 
shirt ripped open at one shoulder. He's wearing a hear- ing aid.
<p> A while ago, when the guard frisked him, this bulky and sickly seeming old 
man, who has a shaving cut on his cheek, who has a shuffle to his walk, turned 
and obediently spread his hands against the wall while the guard began going up 
and down his pant legs.
<p> On the way into the interview, Fred Schnarrs, the warden at the Huntingdon 
County Jail, had mentioned how much the prisoner loves to talk. "Half the time 
it's way above my head," the warden had said. "Law, politics, Constitution, whatever. 
Scholarly." But oddest thing, when things are put in writing, it's almost as if 
a third-grader were at work.
<p> Bill Robb is seated at a table, hands folded. He's been using words like "disallow" 
and "knowingly." In the beginning he'd seemed quite neighborly, polite, evenhanded, 
fair-minded. It's true that it had been pretty much of a monologue at the beginning, 
with the prisoner seeming to be covering the entire history of game laws and dog 
control in the state of Pennsylvania.
<p> A reporter had scribbled, choosing not to interrupt.
<p> "We got along," Robb had said at the start. "We did everything possible for 
them. We loaned him a car. He used our deepfreeze for three years. He'd go to 
the shore in Jersey and catch a lot of blues -- I don't care for them. I think 
somebody gave him a piece of venison once, and he put it our deepfreeze. That 
sort of thing."
<p> Later: "He broke all the dog laws and all the game laws in the state of Pennsylvania. 
I talked to numerous game wardens. {Bert} said, 'I don't give a damn if they run 
all over the valley.' Being a man of civil rights as he was, he violated everybody 
else's civil rights. They had to shout at them anytime anybody pulled up. I said, 
'Bert, these dogs are getting out of control.' "
<p> Increasingly now, a mood is turning. There is a hard set to a man's jaw, some- 
thing alarming in his eyes. All the talk is now about Bert DeLeeuw's "violent 
anger."
<p> DeLeeuw's dogs once attacked him, the prisoner says. Nobody knows this. They 
went after the quail he was trying to raise.
<p> Bert's reply? "So what, Bill?"
<p> A reporter, trying to edge it toward May 2, asks him if he said before the 
gun went off, "I'm really sorry I have to make Chloe fatherless."
<p> He removes his glasses, leans across the table, studies the transcript of 
the preliminary hearing.
<p> "That's an entirely false statement." The paper in his hand is trembling.
<p> A reporter informs him that Lina says she heard him say, "Sorry about that, 
old buddy."
<p> "Oh, my God, no. No no no. If you wouldn't shoot a man's dogs, why would you 
shoot the man?"
<p> Then: "I fired to the side of the man to scare him because he was attacking 
me. That's all I did. He ran into the shot."
<p> Robb now says that Bert had a weapon that day.
<p> A reporter asks him what weapon.
<p> "Some kind of digging weapon."
<p> A reporter asks him what happened to this weapon.
<p> Robb says, "Where is it? Where do you think it is? They got rid of it."
<p> A reporter asks about the night of the arrest, all the things that were reportedly 
said at the state police barracks. What about "I shot Bert"?
<p> The interview is over. A trembling man is trying to get to his feet. The table 
is pushed back. The answer to the last question is essentially this, though the 
reporter doesn't get it verbatim: "They're lying. Any cop lies. You know that."
<p> Shuffling off, face deeply crimson, George William Robb, late of the Hartslog 
Valley Road, seems no more, no less, than some old, tired, bent, sockless man 
consumed by his rage and with nowhere to dump it . . . 
<p align="center">* * *
<p>Bert DeLeeuw's funeral service was held on a Sunday afternoon in May. The weather was tumultuous. Blue 
Moon Farm had almost never looked so groomed. The family dogs -- Emma and Sailor 
and the others -- lay quiet, dozing on top of one another, until the service started. 
Then, oddly, they began barking.
<p> Bert's brother Randy read a moving eulogy. There were psalters and meditations 
and prayers and hymns. A picture was handed out of the deceased in his straw hat 
and plaid shirt on his blistered Farmall. Under the photo of the bespec- tacled 
man on the tractor, who had seemed to so alter his life from the old days on Dupont 
Circle when he'd work half the night and then gobble pizzas at the Trio restaurant, 
was a poem by Wendell Berry titled "The Wish to Be Generous." The last line speaks 
of "a patient willing descent into the grass."
<p> It was many weeks after that funeral service, after the pesticide-free squash 
and peppers and kale and fennel were coming up just fine at Blue Moon, that Lina 
Newhouser could force herself to turn out any of the lights before going to bed. 
And every time she drove the half-mile down the bowered lane toward the macadam, 
Lina had to pass the spot where it happened. And every time she pulled out onto 
the main road, Lina had to notice, at least peripherally, the handsome red brick 
colonial house of Bill Robb sitting right across the way.
<p> One night in late summer, Bob Weinswig, the young farmhand from Wisconsin 
who'll be a key witness in the case should there be a trial, woke up cold from 
his sleep and said to his girlfriend, Sally, something close to these words:
<p> "He did it on purpose, Sal. Bert did it on purpose, don't you see? He knew 
in those last seconds. He turned around on purpose. He started to turn around 
so he wouldn't have to see Bill shoot him. And so there'd be no way Bill could 
ever say it was an accident."
<p> In the first weeks and months following the shooting, family and friends were 
at the farm around the clock. That has tapered off; people finally have to take 
care of their own lives. Locally, however, the response to what happened on this 
property on May 2 is still amazing. A dentist has been coming out evenings to 
help. He just shows up and works for several hours and sometimes doesn't even 
run into Lina. People from all over the valley have come out to volunteer their 
time -- to pick, to mow, to paint, to mind Chloe. In the first hours after the 
shooting, people were already coming down the lane with groceries, covered dishes, 
blankets. In some cases they drove in, put the goods on the table, left without 
saying a word.
<p> This past August an auction was held at the local fire hall. Close to $12,000 
was netted. People brought their castoff weed eaters, ice buckets, their new 8x12 
aluminum storage buildings. "People just wanted to do something," Lina says. 
"I think the community felt devastated. Something like this hadn't happened before."
<p> One night toward the end of summer a solicitor from the valley drove out and 
said to Lina, "We're all responsible." He didn't elaborate.
<p> And why did the shooting happen at all? It seems impossible to know.
<p> So let a story end like this:
<p> On September 23 of this year, a perfect sky-blue Indian summer day, about 
100 adults and children came together at the Friends meetinghouse on Florida Avenue 
in Washington to talk not about the bad dying but the decent living of Bert Jay 
DeLeeuw. Bill Robb's name floated into the room just once, and then only for 
seconds. The service, which lasted until long shadows fell on pale windows, brought 
together people who in some instances hadn't been in each other's company since 
the old days of the movement. To an outsider, it seemed entirely fitting that 
such a memorial service, originally planned for the main rooms, had to be transferred 
to the basement: The upstairs part of the meetinghouse, where there is such fine 
old wood, wasn't available that day. But why not the basement? This was a group 
that had fought its battles from literal and figurative basements. This was a 
group that had hardly ever come in first in the race, though what did that matter.
<p> One saw tears, Earth Shoes, babies in backpacks, moldy ties, old protest buttons: 
Cotton Dust Kills. Adequate Income Now. Freeze Profits Not People.
<p> Bert Sr. and Evelyn of Green Pond sat in a front row. So did Lina and Chloe.
<p> Tim Sampson, who'd thought up the phrase "Robin Hood was right" and who'd 
come in from California, led the service. He said: "Death in our culture is never 
a natural event even when it's natural. And when it's unnatural, it accentuates 
the mystery, the anger, the hurt."
<p> Barry Commoner, down from Brooklyn, spoke next. His hair is completely white. 
It's possible to hear voices in your mind, he said, and for some reason the only 
voice he can hear from 1980 is Bert DeLeeuw's. "The reason, for me, I think, 
is that Bert was an antidote for everything about that campaign that was inhuman. 
Bert was the one who in the midst of the frenzy was calm. I hear Bert's voice 
as the theme of that year." A social scientist hardly known for his emotion then 
bit his lip. Commoner said he is lucky enough to have a constant reminder in his 
home of DeLeeuw's life. "Bookshelves. And I want you to know they're damn good 
bookshelves."
<p> Somebody else got up. "Truth is, a lot of the stuff we worked on, about half 
of it, was crazy. But it was the other half that was near-brilliant that made 
it worth doing."
<p> Somebody told a story about the tent stakes Bert DeLeeuw once set out for 
an encampment "behind the Reagan ranch."
<p> It was as if, through its self-conscious laughing and outright crying, a people 
was seeking clues to the meaning of its own life.
<p> "I've spent the summer missing him," somebody said.
<p> "What I like to think about his farming is that it gave him yet another chance 
to shake the status quo," somebody said.
<p> At the end there was a tune with rollicky gospel in it. This is the refrain: 
"Soon and very soon/ We are going to change this world."
