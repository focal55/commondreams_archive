WASHINGTON -  International arms sales surged last 
year to nearly $30.3 billion, the 
highest level since 1996, and the 
United States solidified its position 
as the world's biggest arms dealer, 
according to an authoritative government report.

<p> The report by Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, showed that 
 American contractors sold nearly 
$11.8 billion in weapons in 1999 -- 
more than a third of the world's 
total and more than all European 
countries combined.

<p> American arms sales, like those 
worldwide, were still far below the 
peaks reached in the aftermath of 
the Persian Gulf war in 1991, but 
the United States has steadily increased its sales in the last few 
years, from $7.7 billion in 1997 and 
$10.3 billion in 1998, the report 
found.

<p> "Obviously the United States' 
position has been consolidated as 
the leading weapons supplier -- 
both for the world as a whole and 
for the developing countries," said 
Richard F. Grimmett, an analyst 
who wrote the report, which is 
delivered every year   to Congress.

<p> While the United States remained the largest supplier, Russia vastly expanded its weapons 
sales in 1999 -- to $4.8 billion, nearly double the $2.6 billion in deals it 
made the year before. With the 
impoverished Russian military 
proving a meager customer, Russia's military-industrial complex 
has begun a major effort to market its wares to Asia, the Middle 
East and Africa.

<p> Nearly half of Russian sales last 
year came from an agreement to 
sell China 40 to 60 Su-30 fighter 
jets, while Russia also provided a 
number of advanced weapons to 
India. With many Western nations 
more willing to buy weapons from 
the United States or other NATO 
nations, China and India are likely 
to remain Russia's most lucrative 
customers in the years to come, 
Dr. Grimmett said.

<p> "The Indians are building up 
their military and the Chinese are 
trying to modernize their force 
structure," he said. "And the Russians are their major supplier. As 
long as those two countries continue to build up, the Russians are 
likely to increase their sales in the 
future."

<p> China also emerged in 1999 as a 
major weapons supplier, reaching 
agreements to sell $1.9 billion 
worth of weapons. That was more 
than double the $925 million it sold 
the year before and the most since 
the Congressional Research Service began compiling its report in 
1992. 

<p> The report attributed most of 
China's increase to relatively 
small weapons deals in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, with 
Pakistan "a key Chinese client." 

<p> The report did not give details of 
China's sales to Pakistan, but a 
separate report sent to Congress 
by the Central Intelligence Agency 
earlier this month said that China 
had increased its efforts to provide 
Pakistan with "missile-related 
technical assistance" last year. It 
also said China had provided similar assistance to Iran, North Korea 
and Libya.

<p> As in the past, roughly two-thirds of all arms were sold to 
developing nations -- and again 
the United States, with $8.1 billion 
in sales, led the way, followed by 
Russia, with $4.1 billion. 

<p> In recent years, the hungriest 
buyers have been countries in the 
Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, 
the United Arab Emirates, Egypt 
and Israel.

<p> In 1999, however, South Africa 
emerged as the leading buyer in 
the developing world, reaching 
agreement for $3.3 billion in weapons purchases, according to the 
report. Much of that was driven by 
the government's  agreement with 
Germany to buy four patrol corvettes and three diesel-electric 
submarines, the report said, a purchase that was criticized by some 
South Africans as too costly.

<p> The report predicted intensifying competition among arms supplies in the years ahead. Many 
countries, eager to protect their 
own defense industries, are less 
likely to turn to the international 
market, while the lingering impacts of the Asia financial crisis of 
1997 could mean still fewer buyers.

<p> The report said, however, that 
those trends enhanced the United 
States' advantage over other international sellers, since previous 
American sales resulted in new 
ones.

<p> "There are very few big sales 
out there," Dr. Grimmett said, 
"but for the last 25 years, we've 
developed relationships with so 
many countries that now, even 
though it's a very difficult market, 
we have a competitive advantage 
in selling spare parts and support 
services."
