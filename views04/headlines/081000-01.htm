 Plutonium contamination in the highest levels detected so far has been found in air samples collected in a 10-day period after a fire in June scorched nearly half the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, the U.S. Department of Energy announced yesterday.
<P>
     In a related development, a second radioactive isotope -- strontium-90 -- has been found at elevated levels in sagebrush across the Columbia River from Hanford, according to results from the State Department of Health. The sample also was collected immediately after the fire.
<P>
     Both radioactive materials were detected at levels below the threshold deemed hazardous to human health and below levels that would have triggered an emergency response, said Debra McBaugh of the state Health Department.
<P>
     "It means it was correct not to evacuate people (from Hanford) . . . and it was correct to let those firefighters fight that fire," she said, responding to concerns that the firefighters were put at risk.
<P>
     The detection of elevated levels of strontium-90 -- a byproduct of the production of nuclear fuel -- was a first.  Strontium poses a health risk to humans because it is deposited in bones, where it can replace calcium and cause cancer.
<P>
     Despite the elevated level of strontium-90, it's still "not a number that's a significant health risk," McBaugh said.
<P>
     The Department of Energy has offered free testing to 700 firefighters who worked in areas where they might have been exposed to strontium-90. No results are available yet.
<P>
     McBaugh said it's still unclear whether the strontium was dispersed in the fire or if it's fallout from weapons testing at Hanford in the 1960s and 1970s. 
<P>
     Plutonium was previously detected in air samples taken during and after the wildfire that burned nearly half of the 560-square-mile reservation in late June. The radioactive material has been found at multiple sites on the reservation and in neighboring cities.
<P>
     The level of plutonium contamination announced yesterday was 0.0016 picocuries per cubic meter of air, which is 100 times higher than the annual average level of plutonium found in the area called 200 West. The site is where some of Hanford's most dangerous radioactive waste is stored underground.
<P>
     Hanford was established during World War II to make plutonium for the atomic bomb and continued to do so for nuclear weapons until the 1980s. The Energy Department has said it expected some dispersal of radioactive material when wind, the fire, and firefighters and equipment stirred up surface contamination at Hanford, the nation's most-contaminated nuclear site.
<P>
     But Gerald Pollet, director of Heart of America Northwest, a Hanford watchdog group in Seattle, contends the Energy Department is using sampling methods that dilute its findings of post-wildfire contamination and that it failed to properly warn firefighters and others of the radiation risks inherent in fighting the fire.
<P>
