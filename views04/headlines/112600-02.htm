LONDON  - The collapse of U.N. climate talks
triggered a blizzard of charges and countercharges on Sunday
over who was responsible for the latest failure to reach a pact
on global warming.
<p>World economic powers hurled blame at each other for the
two-week Hague summit's ending without a plan to coordinate
cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
<p>In developing nations, considered most at risk from higher
temperatures, scorn was poured on the failure of the gas-
guzzling rich to stop squabbling over the cost and unite to
tackle climate change.
<p>``The United States remains obsessed with the idea that it
can use the dollar to buy itself out of trouble'' said a
commentary in South Africa's Daily Mail & Guardian under the
headline ``U.S. plays dirty at climate summit.''
<p>The United States, the world's top polluter, pushed a plan
to allow nations to count carbon dioxide soaked up by forests,
so-called carbon sinks, against emissions targets.
<p>``The reason why they (talks) ultimately collapsed was that
U.S. insisted that grasslands and forests should count in
carbon sequestration (limiting),'' an expert associated with the
independent Tata Energy Research Institute said in New Delhi.
<p>``These are natural processes. And they just happen. It is
not fair for the U.S. to count these as additional activities,''
he said. ``The U.S. intransigence is what led to the breakdown.''
<p>The Hague conference had sought agreement on implementing a
pact reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, which called for a five
percent average cut in developed nations' 1990 levels of
emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide by 2010.
<p>Washington, backed by Australia, Canada and Japan, said it
could not reach its targets without such methods. Opponents
said the plan might actually lead to an increase in global
emissions.
<p>``The refusal of some industrial nations to give climate
protection priority at home caused the failure. It also failed
because industrial countries wanted to count too much their
natural forests as a source of man-made reduction rather than
actually cutting greenhouse gases,'' German Environment Minister
Juergen Tritten, a member of the Greens party, said.
<p><font size=+1><b>Flood, Disease And Fury</b></font>
<p>Scientists say gases like carbon dioxide threaten
potentially disastrous effects on weather, sea levels and the
spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever.
<p>French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, whose country
holds the EU's rotating presidency, said U.S. proposals had
been unacceptable but held out hope for the Kyoto process.
<p>``It would have been a failure not to wage a battle, to keep
posturing on principles or sign a bad climate agreement,'' she
told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in an interview.
<p>``If despite everything there was a failure, it was in the
sense that we have not finished our work.''
<p>She said she hoped the United States would see reason.
<p>``Maybe they'll realize in the end that a resident of
Houston, Texas, emits five times as much global warming gas as
someone who lives in the Paris region,'' she said.
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard defended his
country's backing of the U.S. plan.
<p>``It's very important for Australia that that be kept in the
package,'' he told Nine Network television on Sunday.
<p>``It's all right for the Europeans who get the fortuitous
benefits, in the case of Britain for example, in (mining) pit
closures in the 1980s which, ironically enough, the present
British government, then in opposition, bitterly opposed.
<p>``In Australia's case, the way the rules are written, if
those sinks are out, we carry a disproportionate burden.''
