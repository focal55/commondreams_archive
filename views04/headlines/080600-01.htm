The deep, flat blistered land stretches out across the Southern basin. Mississippi makes for brutally beautiful country - a state haunted by the spectre of racial intolerance and economic dilapidation. 
<P>A three-year drought has ravaged the land, ruining the yield of corn by up to 50 per cent. Driving past the Jackson city limits, farmer Ben Burkett looks enviously at the corn stalks, their golden ears drooping earthwards. 'They is ready for the picking,' he says.  
<P>Black farmers in the US are facing their worst crisis in almost 50 years. Decades of federal funding shortfalls, racism and harvests undercut by imports have seen their agrarian tradition decline to an imperilled profession.  
<P>In January 1999, the US government agreed to pay $375 million to more than 20,000 farmers who alleged years of racial discrimination in loans and subsidies. A class action filed in 1997 by the National Black Farmers' Association was settled after the Department of Agriculture admitted, not racism, but bureaucratic delay. And a report, published last February by the Farm Service Agency, revealed farmers over the past 20 years had applied for loans well in advance of the planting season, to be told no funds were available.  
<P>To date, only 61 per cent of the claims have been settled - with a maximum payment of $50,000. And, like other farmers in the region, Burkett has had to diversify his crops to keep his farm from foreclosure: he now plants soya beans as well as cotton. He is state director at the Federation of Southern Co-operatives Land Assistance Fund - a local outreach programme.  
<P>His family has been farming in the region since 1886 - and Burkett hopes his daughter will strengthen the family's ties to the land. 'But the kids don't wanna work on the farms. The few that don't end up in jail or on drugs get jobs in the North.'   
<P>Migration to cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York is not the only cause of Mississippi's black brain drain. The state penitentiary system houses 19,000 prisoners - 80 per cent of them black.  
<P>The marginalisation of a generation has had a catastrophic effect on agriculture in the area: on average, the black farmer is now 70 years old. The number of black farms has declined from 926,000 in 1920 to 19,000 today.  
<P>Black farmers have had the civil rights clock go back on them by around 100 years,' says Gerald Jaynes, author of  Branches Without Roots: Genesis of the Black Working Class in the American South. 'If anyone needs to subscribe to a conspiracy theory - that the South is intent on ridding itself of black farmers - you needn't go far. Mississippi shows all the proof of black agrarian destruction.'  
<P>Burkett, unlike most local farmers who now have to sell their crops at local markets, has found himself a new client. Each month, he dispatches a truckload of freshly frozen vegetables to Chicago - to Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. The vegetables are regenerated as pies and pastries sold in the Nation's bakeries.  
<P>'It's a good deal, and it helps me move my stock,' says Burkett. Raised as a southern Baptist, he sees no irony in transferring his yield to a Muslim organisation known for pillorying black Christians. 'At least they pay - and they pay me on time. And I sometimes question my own faith: so would it be fair for me to question anyone else's? Every man has to find his own faith.'  
<P>Back in Jackson, Melbah Smith, project-coordinator at the Federation of Southern Co-operatives Land Assistance Fund, walks up East Hamilton Street. It is almost devoid of commerce - empty and peeling wooden houses line neighbouring streets. Smith says: 'We call them shotgun homes - you could fire a shotgun through the front door and not hit anything as it passes out the back.'  
<P>She crosses the street and makes her way towards the Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Centre, once a blacks-only school. It now commemorates black southern agrarian history. A painting upstairs shows Eli Whitney's cotton gin, invented in 1795 - the machine was pirated before the inventor got patent protection.  
<P>The museum proudly parades the black contribution to the Southern farming economy with some hellish facts. When the French introduced African labour to the region in 1719, the Mississippi Delta was worked by 3,500 slaves; by 1865 that number had swollen to 437,000.  
<P>Burkett is driving north, out of Jackson, and towards Yazoo, a tiny farming town 50 miles upstate. Winding through Yazoo, he turns off the road and points his truck towards a dirt driveway. Stopping outside a mobile home, he knocks at the door.  
<P>Lloyd Shaffer, 45, drives into his driveway minutes later. A stocky man with mournful eyes, he was one of an original set of six farmers to sue the Department of Agriculture in 1997 and has yet to receive any more than 60 per cent of his compensation award. Since 1988, he has juggled his role as farmer with the duties of president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People in Yazoo County. In the summer of 1994, racists planted a burning cross opposite his house.  
<P>Shaffer sold his 1,700 acres in April, three months after he was denied another federal loan. Until 1972, his family owned 3,200 acres. His wife, Linda, quotes an old field spiritual: 'They walked the rows to save the land/ They walked the rows, always racing the sun/ But falling behind everyday/ Breaking backs to break crops/ to break cycles.' 'People here thought segregation was bad,' she says. 'Well, this is just as bad. The racism is just as apparent.'  
<P>Lloyd Shaffer, in March, was arrested in Washington for trying to enter the Department of Agriculture. Tomorrow, he hopes to return to the capital, with 2,000 other black farmers. 'Would I be a farmer again?' he asks.  
<P>'I dunno. I regret it. But I don't know how to do anything else.'
