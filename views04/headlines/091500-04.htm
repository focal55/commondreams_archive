Ancient ice drilled from deep inside a glacier
shows that the past century has been the hottest period in 1,000
years in the high Himalayan Mountains.
<p>Researchers said the new finding is yet another indication the
Earth is warming and supports other studies that show a rapid
melting of mountain ice fields is under way on three continents.
<p>``We think this is alarming,'' says Ellen Mosley-Thompson of
Ohio State University, the co-author of a study appearing Friday in
the journal Science.

</font>Mosley-Thompson is a member of a team, led by Lonnie G. Thompson
of Ohio State, that has analyzed ice cores from some of the most
remote mountains in the world. The new cores, cylindrical specimens
of ice, came from a glacier more than 20,000 feet high in the
Himalayas.
<p>``This is the highest climate record ever retrieved,'' Thompson
said in a statement. ``It clearly shows a serious warming during
the late 20th century, one that was caused, at least in part, by
human activity.''
<p>Herman Zimmerman, director of the National Science Foundation's
earth sciences division, said the new studies ``leave little doubt
that the Earth is warming and that all characteristics of our
climate can change rapidly.''
<p>``This is something that needs to be taken quite seriously by
all the peoples of the world,'' Zimmerman said. The NSF sponsored
the 1997 expedition that extracted the Himalayan ice cores.
<p>Mosley-Thompson said the team has the ice cores record chemical
clues of the climatic conditions that existed when the ice was
deposited.
<p>The most recent core, from the Dasuopu Glacier on the flank of
the 26,293-foot Mt. Xixabangma, included ice that was laid down
more than 12,000 years ago.
<p>An analysis of the Dasuopu ice deposited during the last 1,000
years shows a dramatic trend of warming, Mosley-Thompson said.
<p>``The last century has been warmer than the previous nine
centuries,'' Mosley-Thompson said, while the last decade has been
the warmest period of all.
<p>Other studies, based largely on surface temperature readings,
have found a global average warming of almost one degree over the
last century, but the effect may be even more dramatic in the
world's mountains, she said.
<p>``These high elevation ice fields seem to be warming more
strongly than what you could call the global average,''
Mosley-Thompson said.
<p>She said there has been a significant shrinkage of permanent ice
fields in Asia, South America and Africa that provide a significant
part of the flow in major rivers. Many such rivers are in areas
with monsoon weather patterns, where there usually is little rain
for six months of the year. Ice melt from the rivers has become an
increasingly important source of water for cities and farms,
Mosley-Thompson said.
<p>``For these rivers to continue to flow year-round, they have to
be fed by ice in the high mountains,'' Mosley-Thompson said. If the
ice fields continue to shrink, she said, ``the question then is
where will the river flow come from during the dry season.''
<p>Mosley-Thompson said the mountain warming effect seems to be
worldwide.
<p>``Everywhere we go, we get the same picture'' of shrinking ice
fields and increasing high altitude warming, she said.
<p>In northern Peru, there is a marked shrinkage of ice fields in
the Andes and a dry season reduction in flow of up to 70 percent in
the Rimac River which supplies water to Lima, Mosley-Thompson said.
In Africa, aerial photos taken of Mt. Kilimanjaro and checked
against 1912 maps found a 75 percent loss of ice mass, she said.
<p>There are no records to give a historic comparison for the Mt.
Xixabangma ice fields, but she said that Indian scientists have
found rapid shrinkage of ice fields around nearby Mt. Everest and
tentative findings of a reduced dry season flow in rivers draining
the Tibetan plateau.
