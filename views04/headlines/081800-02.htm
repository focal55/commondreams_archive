LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Police Department calls them "scouts," and they are so good
at their job that, during this week's protests, some were shot at and others
were arrested--by their own colleagues.
<P>
   The LAPD undercover officers assigned to join the crowds of demonstrators
drawn by the Democratic National Convention are a young, purposefully rag-tag
group that has blended easily and invisibly into the sea of young protesters.
<P>

   Throughout the week, they have provided a key element in the police
intelligence gathering network, as they circulated unnoticed within crowds
across the city.
<P>
   The LAPD's undercover operation was "an extremely critical part of the
&#091;department's&#093; plan," said Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, who oversees the Police
Department's convention planning unit. "Without good intelligence, we would
not be as efficient as we are."
<P>
   One morning this week, some of these undercover officers met before going
out on the streets in their work clothes: T-shirts and shorts, bandannas,
flip-flops and sneakers. They are allowed to break department policy by
wearing beards and keeping their hair long. One even wore a "Free Mumia"
bandanna.
<P>
   When asked if they were worried about getting swept up in trouble, they
shrugged. It's all in a day's work for these officers. One, however, said,
smiling, that he was a little worried about being shot "by one of those,"
pointing to fellow officers in uniform checking out shotguns.
<P>
   In fact, a few were shot at by their colleagues using stinger rounds and
bean bag projectiles during Monday's melee in which hundreds of police
attempted to move the large crowd that lingered after a concert by the rock
group Rage Against the Machine, police sources said. A day later, a couple of
these undercover officers were arrested in a bicycle protest in which about
100 cyclists tried to block city streets, these sources said.
<P>
   The arrests of 42 animal-rights activists Tuesday, allegedly while in
possession of materials authorities said could be made into homemade flame
throwers, came from information supplied by undercover officers, police said
Thursday.
<P>
   Federal and other local agencies also had undercover officers working
inside the demonstrations this week, police sources said.
<P>
   But the LAPD has a particularly long and rich history of spying on
political dissenters dating back to the "Red Squad" of the 1930s that
regularly broke up union and leftist meetings, hustling protesters to jail.
Then, in the late 1970s and 1980s, it was learned that officers from the
Public Disorder Intelligence Division had infiltrated left-wing groups and
that others had spied on local politicians and critics of the department.
<P>
   Because of the LAPD's dubious history of political spying, this week's
activities have lead some to wonder whether the officers are observers or
provocateurs.
<P>
   "The concern always is the chilling effect it would have on protected
speech activities," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a professor of constitutional law
at University of Southern California. "Even if we're doing nothing wrong as a
group we still might talk differently if we know there is an uninvited police
officer among us."
<P>
   Lisa Fithian, an organizer with D2KLA and the Direct Action Network, said
members of her group saw people dressed as protesters sitting in a police car
after last Sunday's anti-police rally.
<P>
   "It's standard operating procedure: infiltrate and disrupt," Fithian said.
"They are potentially trying to incite problems in the midst of our
demonstrations. We're not doing anything illegal, we're not doing anything
wrong. The question is do they create problems in the midst of our meetings or
actions?"
<P>
   LAPD officials say the information gathered this week was invaluable. And
the use of technology such as cell phones has vastly improved the undercover
operation.
<P>
   That intelligence has improved the department's ability to more quickly
move officers to specific areas of trouble, officials said.
