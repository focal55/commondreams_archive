UNITED NATIONS  - The 189-member General Assembly,
the highest
policy making body at the United Nations, will hold an emergency
special
session Wednesday to discuss the continuing violence in the West
Bank and
Gaza. 
<P>
The move for a special session has been prompted primarily by US
threats to
block all attempts to take the issue - for a second time in less
than two
weeks
- to the 15-member Security Council. 
<P>
The United States abstained on a resolution adopted by the
Security Council on
Oct. 7 that stressed the importance of establishing a mechanism
''for a speedy
and objective inquiry'' into the violence which has claimed the
lives of over
100 Palestinians over a three-week period. 
<P>
US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said last week that in the
unlikely event that
the Security Council agrees to debate the issue a second time,
Washington will
veto any resolution on the subject. 
<P>
''We have made this abundantly clear to our friends and colleagues
in the
Security Council,'' he warned. 
<P>
The discussion on Israeli-occupied territories - which originated
with the
10th
emergency Special Session of the General Assembly in 1997 - has
continued
through February 1999. Since the sessions have never been
adjourned - to
ensure
that the issue remains on the agenda - they have been resumed on
four
different
occasions.  
<P>
On Wednesday, the emergency Special Session will be resumed for
the fifth time
to discuss once again ''the illegal Israeli actions in Occupied
East Jerusalem
and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory''. 
<P>
A resolution drafted by the Permanent Observer Mission of
Palestine to the
United Nations - and backed by the 114-member Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) - is
expected to be adopted by an overwhelming majority of member
states, probably
before Friday. 
<P>
The speculation is that the only opposition to the draft
resolution may come
from the United States and Israel. On Tuesday, Holbrooke was
quoted as saying
that the General Assembly was an ineffective body and its
decisions would not
have a bearing on the crisis.  
<P>
But a UN spokesman told IPS that it was surprising that Holbrooke
should have
made those comments particularly at a time when he is pleading
with the same
Assembly to approve a reduction in US assessments for the UN's
regular and
peacekeeping budgets. 
<P>
The draft resolution condemns the ''acts of violence and the
excessive use of
force by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian
civilians resulting
in injury and loss of human life''. 
<P>
The Assembly will also demand the immediate cessation of violence
arguing that
Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including
Jerusalem, ''are
illegal and an obstacle to peace''. 
<P>
The resolution also ''strongly supports the establishment of a
mechanism of
inquiry'' to probe the violence. 
<P>
On Tuesday, at a summit meeting in the Egyptian Red Sea port of
Sharm
el-Sheikh, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser
Arafat agreed to a cease-fire and the appointment of a commission
to
investigate the violence. But the United States, not the United
Nations, will
play a key role in setting up this proposed commission.  
<P>
Among the participants in the summit were US President Bill
Clinton and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) released
Tuesday the
results of a week-long investigation that condemns Israeli police
and security
forces for ''a pattern of using excessive, lethal force in clashes
with
demonstrators over the past two weeks''. 
<P>
In a report released here, HRW called on both the Palestinian and
Israeli
authorities to take urgent steps to stop their own civilians from
using lethal
force against other civilians - an increasingly serious problem. 
<P>
''Civilians should not be dying in this conflict,'' Hanny Megally
of HRW said
Tuesday. ''The Israelis should use lethal force only when it is
strictly
unavoidable to protect lives, and both sides need to rein in
anyone attacking
or endangering civilians.'' 
<P>
Megally said the results of HRW's investigations showed a
compelling need
for a
credible and independent investigation into serious human rights
violations in
these clashes. 
<P>
He said that under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs
military
occupations, Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and
East Jerusalem,
are internationally protected persons, and signatory states have
an obligation
to respect and ensure respect for rights and guarantees of the
Convention.
