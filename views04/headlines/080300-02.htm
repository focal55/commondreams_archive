San Francisco - A San Francisco jury yesterday punished the nation's 
largest wholesale baker with a staggering $120 million racial 
discrimination judgment for oppressing and denying promotions to 17 
of its black workers.	 
<P>When Ray Dunhams heard the award, the shipping clerk at the San 
Francisco bakery that makes Twinkies, HoHos, Dingdongs and Wonder 
Bread rested his face in his hands and wept.	 
</P>
<P>``Hopefully, it will send a message to large corporations all over 
America to treat all people equally,'' said Dunhams, who was awarded 
$2.1 million of the total punitive damages.	 
</P>
<P>Dunhams and the other 20 plaintiffs in the case rose from their 
seats after the verdict was read in Superior Court and applauded the 
jurors, who also had tears in their eyes. 	 
</P>
<P>The award fell slightly short of the landmark $176 million Texaco 
Inc. discrimination settlement four years ago.	 
</P>
<P>``This shouldn't be happening in the 21st century,'' said jury 
foreman Francisco Ortiz. ``I have to stop talking now because I'm 
about to break down.''	 
</P>
<P>The lawsuit, filed in 1998, alleged that black employees at 
Interstate Brands Corp. -- the Kansas City, Mo., parent company of 
Hostess, Home Pride and Dolly Madison -- were denied promotions, 
given the most labor-intensive and monotonous jobs and treated with 
hostility in the company's San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Clara 
plants.	 
</P>
<P>On Monday, the jury awarded 21 of the plaintiffs in the case more 
than $11 million for lost wages, pain and suffering caused by the 
company's discrimination. The judge, however, reduced the general 
damages by $5.5 million, according to attorneys representing IBC.	 
</P>
<P>Seventeen of those workers, according to the jurors, were treated 
with ``malice and oppression'' and by legal definition were entitled 
to ask for punitive damages.	 
</P>
<P>COMPANY PLANS APPEAL
</P>
<P>Mark Klein, a spokesman for IBC, said the company was disappointed 
that punitive damages were awarded and plans to appeal.	 
</P>
<P>``The facts of the case do not support awarding any damages, much 
less punitive damages,'' he wrote in a statement. ``The verdict was 
not supported by the company's record. We continue to believe that 
these allegations are unsubstantiated and that extensive legal errors 
were committed in this trial.''	 
</P>
<P>But Gerald Brown, the company's first black truck driver who was 
awarded $17.9 million yesterday, says the judgment was well deserved. 
For four years, Brown said, he was subjected to racial jokes and 
abuse.	 
</P>
<P>``My shop steward told me this one: `How do you tell if a black man 
is well hung? When he stops kicking.' ''	 
</P>
<P>FIRED AFTER MAKING COMPLAINT	
</P>
<P> Brown said he helped train white employees who quickly went on to be 
promoted while he stayed in the same job position. When he filed a 
formal complaint he was fired.	 
</P>
<P>``The hardest thing I've ever done in this world was bringing my 
boss to court,'' he said. ``But I'm glad I did it.''	 
</P>
<P>Harold Jones Jr. was awarded $13.9 million during yesterday's 
punitive phase but said nothing could compensate him for the 
degradation he endured at IBC's Oakland plant, where he worked as a 
route salesman.	 
</P>
<P>``I hope the company finally sees what's going on,'' he said.	 
</P>
<P>Jones said that when he was hit by a drunken driver in a Wonder 
Bread delivery trunk in 1996 he was put on light duty. But unlike the 
white employees who answered the phone and did paperwork, Jones was 
forced to sweep the driveway.	 
</P>
<P> ``The white workers got cots so they could rest when they needed 
to,'' he said. ``But they wanted to humiliate me.''	 
</P>
<P> He said his supervisor told the human resources department not to 
worry about Jones quickly returning to his sales job because ``they'' 
heal fast.	 
</P>
<P> Jones said he was forced to go back to regular duty before he had 
healed from his two operations and as a result was forced out of his 
job.	 
</P>
<P>SLURS HURLED DAILY
</P>
<P>Charles Wright said he believes the jury gave him $15.5 million 
because of the emotional stress he suffered at the hands of IBC 
supervisors. He says he lost clumps of hair and broke out in rashes 
because of the racial slurs that were hurled at him on an almost 
daily basis. He said he watched as black employees were forbidden to 
use the same bathroom as white workers.	 
</P>
<P>``Today was a fatal blow to racism in this country,'' he said. ``I'm 
totally overwhelmed.''	 
</P>
<P>Judge Stuart Pollack, who presided over the case, indicated late 
yesterday that he is considering postponing collection of the 
judgment until he resolves other legal matters in the case.	 
</P>
<P> The majority of all punitive awards amounts to less than $40,000 a 
person, according to a study by the U.S. Justice Department.	 
</P>
<P> ``The jurors today told corporate America don't even try it,'' said 
Angela Alioto, who represented 18 of the plaintiffs in the case. 
``You treat all people equally or you will get hit with a Wonder 
Bread verdict.''
