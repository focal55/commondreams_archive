WASHINGTON - The World Bank's funding of projects in
Russia is undermining environmental protection and the rule of
law, charge environmental organisations. 
<P>
Environmental activists have been protesting the Bank's lending to
Russia since President Vladimir Putin acted by decree last May and
abolished two federal environmental protection bodies. 
<P>
Putin placed the responsibilities of the Committee on Ecology and
the Forest Service under the Ministry of Natural Resources, an
agency in charge of resource extraction, not protection. 
<P>
Environmentalists warned that without independent environmental
enforcement agencies, the World Bank cannot guarantee that its
projects will comply with Russia's environmental law. 
<P>
The financial institution angered environmentalists when just five
days after Putin's decree the World Bank approved a 60 million
dollar loan to Russia's Forest Service, which had just been
abolished. 
<P>
''If the World Bank does not have the sense not to lend money to
abolished agencies, the overall veracity of its overall portfolio
in Russia must be questioned,'' said Doug Norlen, policy director
of the California-based Pacific Environment and Resources Center. 
<P>
Following protests from Russian and international environmental
groups, the institution subsequently halted disbursement of the
loan. 
<P>
Environmentalists are increasing their call against lending to
Russia this week since the Bank is expected to discuss loans and
guarantees for Russia's forestry and mining sectors at a board
meeting Sep. 12. 
<P>
Russia's only public interest law organisation, Ecojuris, says
Putin's move is illegal and is suing the government for abolishing
the two agencies. 
<P>
''By approving these projects in the face of, and even in defence
of the illegal abolition of the environmental protection agency,
the World Bank is undermining the rule of law in Russia,'' added
Norlen. 
<P>
On Friday, James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank again
defended the institution's position with Russia. 
<P>
''We said (to Russia) ... Look, you've collapsed the environment
ministry ... and we're prepared to make a loan, but only, only pay
you when you have re-established conditions under which the
environmental conditions can be monitored and supervised and
supported,'' he told reporters. 
<P>
These conditions for receiving the loan, said Wolfensohn, include
public debate.  He said this would involve establishing a way that
the public could comment on projects in Russia via the Internet. 
<P>
The forestry loan, added Wolfensohn, is ''subject to the Russians
doing all these things, and that is a function that the Bank can
perform far more effectively than anybody else because we've tied
it to lending.'' 
<P>
Bank officials are bracing for expected protests later this month
against the institution's overall lending policies when the
institution meets in Prague for its annual meetings. 
<P>
''Approval of projects that harm the environment and undermine the
rule of law just fuels the sort of folly the World Bank is famous
for,'' said Norlen. 
<P>
Outrage over Putin's decree among Russian citizens is growing, he
added. In a recent poll, 87 percent of Russian citizens condemned
Putin's decision.  
<P>
Groups in Russia are currently organising a citizen's referendum
that would allow the entire nation to vote on whether the two
protection bodies should remain. Russian environmentalists said
they have already noticed a negative impact on environmental
protection as a result of Putin's decree. 
<P>
In one case, a regional head of the State Committee on Ecology in
the Russian Far East region of Kamchatka recently abandoned his
support for a UN programme protecting two key salmon watersheds
that are also coveted by the Ministry of Natural Resources for
their gold and gas deposits. 
<P>
Environmentalists with Baikal Wave, a group that aims to protect
Lake Baikal - the world's oldest and deepest lake - said that
since the termination of the agencies, they are not sure how to go
about their previous efforts to monitor the ecology of the lake. 
<P>
Before Putin's decree they received certification from the State
Committee on Ecology that would allow them to monitor pollution,
hunting and fishing near the lake. 
<P>
''Maybe (because of the decree), these certificates will be just a
piece of paper and nothing more,'' says Vyacheslav Kudryavtsev,
who works with Baikal Wave. 
<P>
Putin's decree amounts to more than just another restructuring of
Russian bureaucracy, according to Dmitry Lisitsyn of Sakhalin
Environment Watch, an advocacy group on Sakhalin Island in the
Russian Far East. 
<P>
''The abolished committee on environmental protection was one of
the major achievements of the democratic movement in Russia
following the collapse of the Soviet Union,'' said Lisitsyn. 
<P>
Putin's decree, he said, amounts to a ''wholesale attempt by the
government to turn Russia into a natural resource colony.''
