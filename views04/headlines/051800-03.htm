LONDON  - France called Thursday for the
destruction of rapeseed crops contaminated by genetically
modified material as environmentalist fury swept across Europe
over how farmers had been sold ``Frankenstein seed.''
<p>The controversy erupted when the Advanta company, which
imported the seed from Canada, disclosed that farmers in
Britain, France, Germany and Sweden were unwittingly growing
oilseed rape contaminated with genetically modified (GM)
material.<p>Environmental pressure groups warned the contamination could
spread to other crops through wind-blown pollination and said
there was a risk to public health. They demanded compensation
for farmers.<p>France's Environment Minister Dominique Voynet called for
the destruction of about 1,500 acres of rapeseed grown from
seeds contaminated by GM material and demanded an inquiry into
how GM seeds had been mixed with normal ones.<p>``Dominique Voynet calls for ... the identification of plots
where these seeds were planted in order to destroy the rapeseed
in question, accompanied of course by compensation for the
affected farmers,'' the Environment Ministry said in a
statement.<p><font size=+1><b>Italian Fraud Probe</b></font><p>Italian Farm Minister Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio said he was
ordering anti-fraud checks.<p>``I have asked the anti-fraud inspectorate to verify whether
transgenic seeds have been sold to (Italian) farmers without
their knowledge,'' Pecoraro Scanio told Reuters.<p>British officials, conscious of growing public opposition to
GM foods, rushed to minimize the problem and offer health
assurances.<p>``We believe there is no threat to the environment because
the GM variety is sterile and it is difficult to see how it
could cross-pollinate with other plants,'' Agriculture Minister
Nick Browne told parliament.<p>In Stockholm, the Agriculture Department said 14 tons of
seeds imported into Sweden in 1999 from Canada contained 0.4
percent of genetically modified rapeseed.<p>Germany said it would not destroy up to 740 acres of
rapeseed being grown from seeds contaminated by GM material.<p>``Our experts say there are no rules that would compel us by
law to destroy it,'' an Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman told
Reuters.<p>Advanta spokesman David Buckeridge said the areas sown with
GM-contaminated seed were small and that there was no risk to
health. He also said that no laws had been broken.<p><font size=+1><b>Environmentalists Unconvinced</b></font><p>Environmentalists were not convinced.<p>``These trials have now gone beyond farce,'' said Peter
Riley, of Friends of the Earth, a leading environmental group.<p>``The only sensible course of action must be for the
government to order the abandonment of these trials before any
more GM pollution is released into the environment.''<p>A clutch of farm-scale government-backed trials of GM crops
are currently operating across Britain. Green activists have
been arrested after trashing the crops in well-publicized
demonstrations.<p>Organic farmers fear their crops will be tainted by GM
material even it is grown some distance from their own farms.<p>Used in foods ranging from chocolate to ice cream, the rape
could be sold to consumers as a GM-free product, despite strict
rules on food labeling and uncertainty about possible hazards
associated with the technology.<p>The Soil Association, the organic farmers' mouthpiece,
demanded action by the British government.<p>``We believe it's the government's responsibility to track
down the 600 farms involved and destroy the crop,'' the group's
director Patrick Holden told Reuters.<p>Environmental group Greenpeace called on the British
government to recall and destroy GM oilseed rape mistakenly
planted in Britain and said Advanta should compensate farmers.<p>``This fiasco will affect farmers, animal feed mills and
honey producers who are faced with a contaminated product that
is both illegal and potentially unsafe,'' the group said.<p>Advanta Seeds UK, part of a 50-50 venture between
Anglo-Swedish group AstraZeneca Plc and the Dutch cooperative
Cosun that imported the seeds to Europe, said it told the
British government about them last month.<p>British farmers sowed about 22,240 acres with the affected
stocks last year, and about 11,610 acres in spring 2000.
