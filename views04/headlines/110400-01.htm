LONDON - The British government illegally expelled nearly 2,000 inhabitants
of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean at the height of the Cold War
to make way for a strategic U.S. military base on Diego Garcia, the High
Court ruled here Friday.
<p>The judges overturned a 1971 immigration order banning the Ilois
islanders from their native lands and decided that the exiles--now
numbering about 4,500 with descendants, according to their attorneys, and
living in Mauritius and the Seychelles--have a right to return to the
65-island archipelago.
<p>"For us, it is a historical day to win this fight. It seems like David
and Goliath," said Olivier Bancoult, chairman of the Chagos Refugee Group
in Mauritius, who was exiled in 1968 at the age of 4. "We all think about
returning, and we want compensation for all we have been suffering."
<p>The British government said it will not appeal the decision and will
complete an ongoing feasibility study on resettling the exiles.
<p>The U.S. government is not party to the suit. In Washington, the
Pentagon reacted warily to the ruling.
<p>"The United States does have a strategic interest on Diego Garcia,"
said a Defense Department official who asked not to be named because of
the sensitivity of the case. "But this is a matter between the British
authorities and the individuals who brought the case. We have no comment
on the merits of the case."
<p>The official added, however, that Diego Garcia "has played a primary
role in the support of naval and Air Force units operating in the Indian
Ocean and the Persian Gulf."
<p>U.S. units responding to Middle East crises have used the base to
refuel. The Air Force and Marine Corps store heavy equipment on Diego
Garcia for use in the event of a Middle East emergency. U.S. warplanes
based on the island flew missions during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
<p>"It's one of the two or three single most important U.S. military
bases in the world," said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense policy expert at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
<p>Bancoult's attorney, Richard Gifford, said the U.S. government filed a
statement during the hearing opposing the islanders' return to the
archipelago on the grounds that it would be a "threat to national
security," despite a distance of more than 130 miles between the air base
and the nearest island.
<p>The case of the exiled islanders is seen by many here as a sad chapter
of Britain's colonial past and Cold War history. It has been an
embarrassment for British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who expressed
outrage at the eviction as a young member of Parliament when the story
first came to light in 1975--then had to send attorneys to defend the
action in the High Court hearing in July.
<p>The Foreign Office said after the decision that "the government has
not defended what was done or said 30 years ago" and, as the court
recognized, "made no attempt to conceal the gravity of what happened."
<p>The Chagos islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965 and became a
new colony called the British Indian Ocean Territory. The deal with
then-Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson led to Mauritius' independence
three years later.
<p>About 1,500 miles south of India, in a region of interest to China and
the Soviet Union, the territory was leased in 1966 to the United States
for use as an air and naval base for 50 years.
<p>The U.S. government reportedly gave Britain a multimillion-dollar
discount on its U.S.-made Polaris nuclear weapons system as payment for
use of the islands. A memo from Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart to
Wilson in 1969 admitted that the U.S. payment for use of the islands was
kept secret from Parliament and the U.S. Congress.
<p>But the United States wanted a land without people, and the islands
were depopulated by stealth between 1967 and 1973, according to
information revealed in a U.S. congressional investigation in 1975 and in
Foreign Office documents declassified after 30 years and introduced in
the case.
<p>Although some of the islanders--descendants of African and Indian
plantation workers--had lived there for generations, Britain asserted
that they were temporary migrants and therefore could be removed without
concern for their rights.
<p>Paul Gore-Booth, a senior Foreign Office official in 1966, wrote to a
diplomat, "We must surely be very tough about this. The object of the
exercise is to get some rocks which will remain ours. . . . There will be
no indigenous population except sea gulls. . . ."
<p>Residents who left the island for any reason were prevented from
returning. The remaining inhabitants eventually were evicted to Mauritius
and the Seychelles, where they failed to adjust to city life. Most
remained on the fringes of society, poor and uneducated.
<p>Bancoult recounted how his 11-member family went to Mauritius in 1968
so that his ill sister could see a doctor.
<p>After she died, the family tried to return home, "but we were told the
land had been given to the Americans for a U.S. military base."
<p>He recalled wanting to take to Mauritius a drum that his grandfather
had given him but was told to leave it behind. "We couldn't carry all of
our belongings, and we were thinking we would go back," he said.
<p>An electrician with three children of his own now, Bancoult said he
hopes he will be allowed to go home "and put flowers on my grandparents'
graves."
<p>In the decision, Lord Justice John Laws told the court that banishing
the islanders had been an "abject legal failure" by the British
government. The court said the government had used excessive zeal in
removing the population, even when judged by the standards of the
colonial times.
<p>Gifford, Bancoult's attorney, said he was uncertain how the government
ultimately would comply with the court ruling, whether the exiles would
be allowed to return to their native islands or be relocated on the
islands farthest from Diego Garcia, or whether they ultimately would be
asked to remain abroad and receive compensation.
<p>"We are ready to negotiate," Gifford said.
<p>O'Hanlon, the U.S. defense expert, said the impact of the decision
will depend on whether returning islanders are allowed to live anywhere
they wish. He said it appears possible that restrictions could be applied
to residents to prevent them from interfering with operations at the
military base.
<p>In the absence of such restrictions, O'Hanlon said, the ruling could
limit future military operations at Diego Garcia.
<p>"It could be a major hindrance," he said.
