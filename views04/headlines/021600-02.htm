<p>BRUSSELS - A newly released report on biopatenting
and food security has called on Europe to ensure that food
security and the protection of biodiversity take precedence over
commercial interests.
<P>
   The report, 'Biopatenting and the Threat to Food Security - A
Christian and Development Perspective,' was published by
International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity (CIDSE). <P>
   The CIDSE is a Catholic development alliance of 15
organisations from Europe, North America and New Zealand. <P>
   The report suggests that patents on genetically modified crops,
enforced by current world trade rules and pushed by its
supporters, such as the European Union (EU), enables major Trans-
National Corporations (TNCs) to exploit crops at the expense of
farmers in poor countries. <P>
   Jef Felix, CIDSE's Secretary General, said in a statement that
the EU was currently supporting global trade rules on patents that
permit huge life science companies to gain control over the
earth's genetic resources. <P>
   "These rules result in the marginalisation and impoverishment
of poor farmers and communities in the developing world. This
contradicts and undermines the EU's own development policy which
is aimed at the eradication of poverty and the promotion of food
security," he said. <P>
   "Europe must ensure that international development commitments,
made at various UN conferences over the past decade, including
those dealing with food security and the protection of
biodiversity, take precedence over commercial interests," he
added. <P>
   The report will be sent to key officials in the Trade and
Development Directorates of the EU's executive body, the European
Commission, to members of the European Parliament and to EU member
states' governments. <P>
   It also urges the international community at large to review
the multilateral trade rules in order to ban patenting of life
forms. This is a stance advocated by a large number of Third World
nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America and by many development
organisations. <P>
   "Opposition (to the ban proposal) has come from, amongst
others, the European Commission and EU Member States," says CIDSE,
adding that there is a fundamental inequity in the formulation and
revision of trade rules. <P>
   The development network says that the existing patent system
does not compensate indigenous peoples for their accumulated
knowledge and expertise. In its report it denounces the present
tendency to patent products based on traditional knowledge 'as
this may curtail the rights of indigenous peoples to trade these
products to countries where the patent was granted'. <P>
   It also says that the commercialisation of farming leads to
traditional varieties being pushed out of the market and farmers
becoming dependent on uniform commercial varieties. This, the
report states, undermines small-scale mixed subsistence and local
market-based production systems. <P>
   "This is a huge threat to small-scale agriculture with its
multiple roles as it could dramatically reduce the food security
of millions of poor people," says the report.  <P>
   It warns that important stakeholders, such as poor farmers, the
majority of whom are women, are systematically excluded from trade
talks, while TNCs have little difficulty in gaining access to
trade negotiators. <P>
   "At the moment, TNCs have the means to set prices, apply for
patents anywhere they want (the costs of which are too high for
small farmers), fight legal battles using teams of lawyers and
steer privately funded research and development in their
commercially oriented direction," notes the CIDSE report. <P>
   According to CIDSE, 80 percent of patents on genetically
modified foods are owned by just 13 TNCs and the top five
agrochemical companies control 'almost the entire global seed
market'. <P>
   "What is unacceptable is the growing concentration of control
of the world's food supply in fewer and fewer corporate hands,"
say Jef Felix and Justin Kilcullen, President of CIDSE, in the
preface of the report. <P>
   Under the so-called Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPS)
agreement, the United States and some European countries have been
pushing for stronger intellectual property protection, including
genetically modified crops. <P>
   TRIPS is one of the agreements of the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), negotiated under the Uruguay Round and signed by more than
130 countries in Marrakesh, Morrocco, in 1994. <P>
   Over the last few years, several developing countries have
increasingly voiced the concern that powerful corporations from
the North are 'stealing' their genetic resources and patenting
them, and some of them want the patenting of life forms removed
from the agreement entirely. <P>
   But the poorest countries in the South account for only a tiny
fraction of world trade and can hardly engage effectively in
multilateral negotiations on trade because they often lack
resources.   <P>
   Also, aid conditionality can require changes in their trade
policies. <P>
   "Some (poor countries) do not have representation in Geneva
(WTO Headquarters), and may have to rely on aid money to attend
meetings," says CIDSE. <P>
   A significant number of non-governmental groups have disputed
at least five areas of the TRIPS agreement that, in their view,
are in conflict with other international agreements. These include
the Convention on Biodiversity, which grants local communities
rights to manage their resources and genetic materials such as
crops and seeds.   <P>
   Under the TRIPS agreement, countries must grant patents for a
minimum of 20 years to any inventions, including genetically
modified crops, and other manufacturers can be granted licences to
reproduce the product. 
<P>
   TRIPS allows developing countries a period of 10 years (up to
2005) to amend their patent legislation and be TRIPS compliant.
