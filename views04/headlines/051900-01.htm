For years, the Paramount Television studio has been left out of the 
riches of daytime talk television as 
shows starring Oprah Winfrey and 
Rosie O'Donnell became wildly popular.

<p> So, last spring, top Paramount executives jumped at a chance to 
produce a talk show starring Dr. 
Laura Schlessinger, the conservative 
advice-giver whose radio show is the 
second-highest-rated talk show in the 
nation. They scheduled it for September and sold it to stations covering 96 
percent of the country.

<p>  But now they are facing an increasingly vociferous protest by gay 
advocacy groups, who are angered 
by what they say is Dr. Schlessinger's anti-gay message. And the 
protests are getting results.

<p>  This week, the nation's second-largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, announced that it was dropping 
plans to sponsor the TV show and 
would stop advertising on her radio 
program because of the controversy 
generated by the protests.

<p>  Yesterday, United Airlines, a unit 
of UAL, said it would not run any 
more advertisements for the radio 
show in its in-flight magazine. A 
week ago,  the Canadian Broadcast 
Standards Council issued a condemnation of Dr. Schlessinger's radio 
commentary and recommended that 
stations censor any anti-gay remarks by her.

<p>     Gay activists have complained 
about her descriptions of  homosexuality  as "deviant" and derivative of 
"biological error."

<p>  Dr. Schlessinger, who declined to 
be interviewed about the protest, has 
said in  articles and broadcast commentaries that her statements are 
being taken out of context. She has 
said that while she opposes homosexuality and a "gay activist agenda," 
she does not oppose gays.

<p> Paramount executives said they 
were standing behind the program, 
which they maintained would carry 
positive messages about family values and would not promote "hate, 
hurt or intolerance." 

<p> The reactions to the protests  reflect the growing political and economic clout of gays.

<p>      It has been far more common for 
mainstream marketers to listen to 
groups on the right like the American Family Association, which assert that they represent millions of 
consumers, than to those representing gays, a smaller segment.

<p> About the only time that advocates 
for gays have won a big, visible victory was two decades ago when their 
protests and boycott led Florida citrus commissioners to end an endorsement contract with the singer 
Anita Bryant.

<p> Boycott threats from conservatives have proved mostly powerless 
-- as when the sales of the Clorox 
Company a decade ago were unaffected by a boycott called by the 
family association for sponsoring 
shows with content it viewed as objectionable. 

<p> But the conservative organizations 
have achieved results by generating 
controversy about a TV series or 
individual episode that dissuaded 
marketers from buying commercial 
time in the first place, rather than 
withdrawing commercials they had 
already agreed to run. 

<p> That worked for two years to keep 
most mainstream advertisers off 
"N.Y.P.D. Blue" despite strong ratings in the initial two seasons; only 
after seeing how that large viewership kept watching the series week 
after week did large advertisers 
climb aboard.

<p> "Controversy is in general something advertisers want to avoid," 
said Howard Buford, president and 
chief executive at Prime Access in 
New York, an agency specializing in 
campaigns directed toward gays. 
"The idea of advertising is to pull 
people in, not drive people away, so 
when a topic is divisive or polarizing, 
you want to stay away."

<p> The reason advertisers would begin to listen to gays about what upsets them is a result, Mr. Buford 
said, of "the fact that there's a very 
different picture now of who is gay 
and what it means."

<p>       Robin Tyler, a gay who co-founded 
a Web site that has rallied opposition 
to the Dr. Schlessinger TV show 
(www.stopdrlaura.com), said one 
reason the anti-Schlessinger forces 
were gaining momentum so quickly 
 was that the Internet was enabling 
the organizers "to get out our messages instantly, reaching millions of 
us in our own communities."

<p>  Stopdrlaura.com was the brainchild of a small group of activists. 
But now, established gay and lesbian 
organizations like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation are 
marshaling their forces to join the 
fight.

<p>   Dr. Schlessinger has  said that 
while gays are "entitled to love and 
respect as are all human beings," 
homosexual activity is incompatible 
with Scripture. She has said she supports the concept of  therapy for gays 
who wish to change their sexual orientation. She supported a ballot  proposition in California that outlawed 
same-sex marriages.

<p>   The decision by Procter & Gamble, 
which  spends more than $2.6 billion a 
year in advertising for brands like 
Tide, Pampers and Crest, could lead 
to defections by other advertisers 
because the company is a pacesetter 
among the mass market advertisers 
that buy most of the commercial 
time during syndicated talk shows.

<p>  Paramount executives said yesterday that no other sponsors had pulled 
out. Despite trepidation expressed by 
some station managers, the executives said no local stations had 
moved to drop the show.

<p> The show is said to have offended 
employees at all levels of Paramount, and some of the studio's executives want it dropped. 

<p> The producer of "Frasier," David 
Lee, who is openly gay, said yesterday that he had repeatedly asked his 
studio to call off the show, but to no 
avail.
