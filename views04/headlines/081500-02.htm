LOS ANGELES - At 
Democratic conventions past, the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson wrote  a compelling piece of the story line. The 1988 
convention in Atlanta, for instance, 
was consumed with the question of 
how warmly Mr. Jackson would embrace Michael S. Dukakis, who had 
defeated him in the primaries.

<p>    At this year's convention, however, Mr. Jackson's son Representative 
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. is the one making waves by giving voice to the 
concerns within the party's left wing 
about its centrist ticket.

<p>

</TABLE>
</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>It began on Saturday, at a forum at 
the University of Southern California, when Mr. Jackson, a third-term 
Democrat from Chicago, was asked 
whether people should vote for Vice 
President Al Gore and his running 
mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman.

<p>  "The only option is Al Gore," he 
responded. "But if there was another 
campaign that was speaking to our 
issues that had the possibility and 
plausibility of winning, we should 
support that campaign."

<p>  Today, at another forum, this one 
part of a shadow convention organized by a coalition of left-leaning 
groups, Mr. Jackson made it clear 
that he would aggressively campaign for the Gore-Lieberman ticket. 
But he continued to cast his decision 
as one driven more by his fear of the 
alternative: electing George W. Bush 
and Dick Cheney.

<p> At a news conference after the 
speech, Mr. Jackson said: "I am 
supporting Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman, and I'm doing it as enthusiastically as I can. But Jackie Wilson is 
not on the ticket, and Elvis Presley is 
not on the ticket, so Mr. Excitement 
is not running for president. This is 
about pragmatism."

<p>    Indeed, there has been low-level 
tension among Democrats, tension 
that has surfaced anew since Mr. 
Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. 
Lieberman as his running mate -- 
that pits centrists against  Democratic liberals. While a moderate message is seen as necessary to win 
undecided independent voters, the 
party's left wing argues that a more 
traditional agenda is needed to excite minorities and other voters from 
the Demcrats' base.   
<p>Some liberals 
have complained about Mr. Lieberman's support for federal vouchers 
to pay for private school tuition and 
about his statements in opposition to 
affirmative action.

<p>  On Tuesday, Mr. Lieberman is expected to address some of those concerns at a meeting of black delegates 
here, and several Gore campaign 
officials have been acting as ambassadors to concerned black Democrats, assuring them that Mr. Lieberman's record is acceptable.

<p>Such concerns are something the 
Gore campaign could do without as it 
tries to generate enthusiasm for its 
candidate, and seeks to motivate a 
traditional base that include minorities, women and union members.

<p>     Mr. Jackson said he would try to 
persuade disillusioned liberal Democrats against defecting to  Ralph Nader and the Green Party. And he 
criticized the Gore campaign's recent emphasis on restoring the country's sense of morality, something 
Mr. Lieberman has emphasized 
throughout his career.   
<p>"When we 
start getting into this personal-life 
litmus test we are deep in Jerry 
Falwell and Pat Robertson territory," the younger Mr. Jackson said, 
"and that is unfamiliar Democratic 
real estate."

<p>  Mr. Jackson's father has not 
stayed silent, and today made essentially the same point.   
<p>"If it means we 
have to hold our noses and take castor oil, do it," the elder Mr. Jackson 
urged a group of voters today. 

<p>The elder Mr. Jackson is scheduled to speak at the convention on 
Tuesday night. Though he has had 
starring roles at past conventions, he 
said he was not bothered by the fact 
that he was slated to appear this 
year before network television coverage begins. 

<p>  "Whenever I speak," he said, "it's 
prime time."
