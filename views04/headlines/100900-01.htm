NEW DELHI  - India and Pakistan could still lose a
fight over
the ownership of 'Basmati' rice to a U.S.-based company, which has
been
forced to withdraw patent claims on the fragrant rice that has
been grown
for centuries in the central Indian Himalayan foothills. 
<P>
   Food security experts say celebrations by the Indian
government's
Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development
Authority
(APEDA), which filed for revocation of the patents granted in
September
1997 to 'Rice Tec' by the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO), may be
early.  
<P>
   ''We have succeeded in forcing Rice Tec to withdraw four out of
20
claims. The claims now withdrawn would have adversely affected
India's
commercial interests in future exports of Basmati rice,'' said an
APEDA
statement. 
<P>
   But leading food security activist Devinder Sharma argues that
by
withdrawing four of its crucial claims, Rice Tec has foiled
India's
attempts to strike down the patent. 
<P>
   According to Sharma, Rice Tec withdrew these because it
realised its
claims pertaining to 'novel rice grains' would not hold in the
light of the
re-examination sought by APEDA with the USPTO. 
<P>
   ''Of the 20 claims, only four are specific to the
characteristics of the
rice grain while the remaining 16 claims are more or less
concerned with
'novel rice lines', which details breeding techniques,
characteristics and
properties for cultivation outside the Indian sub-continent,'' he
says. 
<P>
    APEDA's strategy was to contest the claims made on novel rice
grains on
the premise that that the rest of Rice Tec's claims would then
automatically fall flat. But Rice Tec's lawyers, apparently
sensing the
strategy, deftly withdrew the clearly untenable claims.  
<P>
   ''Instead of celebrating and putting on a brave front in
public, APEDA
must quickly challenge the withdrawal and force the USPTO to
either accept
the entire patent application for re-examination or direct Rice
Tec to
withdraw its patent,'' says Sharma. 
<P>
   Rice Tec's claim on Basmati rice is said to be the most
audacious
instance of 'biopiracy' by Western transnational corporations
(TNCs). The
Indian government has successfully contested in the United States,
the
grant of a patent on the commercial use of the traditional
medicinal
properties of turmeric. 
<P>
   Another well-known example of biopiracy is the patent on the
herbicidal
properties of the 'neem' tree.  
<P>
   The Indian government was successful in the turmeric patent
case because
it could produce documented evidence, from ancient Indian texts,
showing
that turmeric's medicinal use was well known in the country for
centuries. 
<P>
   ''The Basmati case is tricky techno-legal business and once we
take up a
position we cannot easily withdraw it,'' explains Raghunath
Mashelkar,
director general of the Council of
Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).  
<P>
   But leading Indian anti-biopiracy campaigner, Vandana Shiva,
who
successfully challenged patents on neem granted to 'W.R. Grace' by
the
Munich-based European Patent office, accuses the government of
''lethargy,
indifference and collusion'' with Western interests. 
<P>
   According to Shiva, the Indian government is actually helping
biopirates. She has challenged in India's Supreme Court, a
biodiveristy law
enacted by Parliament last year, which allows TNCs exclusive
marketing
rights (EMRs) for traditional medicines that are used by the bulk
of the
one billion Indians. 
<P>
   ''The implication of the (biodiversity) bill is that the global
seed
industry can freely take seeds, claim patents or breeder's rights
by
tinkering with them and not be regulated,'' she explains. 
<P>
   In contesting the neem patents, Shiva too cited ancient texts
to show
that neem products have been used in India for centuries for
medicinal and
agricultural purposes. Earlier, the
Indian government lost its challenge to the neem patents in the
United States. 
<P>
   Pakistani anti-biopiracy campaigner, Uzma Jamil describes the
Basmati
and turmeric patents as ''manifestations of the increasing
infringement of
the economic and national sovereignty of the South by the North.''  
<P>
   According to Jamil, who is with the 'South Asia Commission on
Environmental, Economic and Social Policy, Rice Tec's claims are
clear
violations of the Convention on Biodiveristy (CBD), which
recognises the
sovereignty of a state over its natural genetic resources. 
<P>
''The manner in which Rice Tec established its patent,
demonstrates that it
has ignored the contributions of local communities in the
production of
Basmati and that it does not intend to share the benefits,'' says
Jamil. 
<P>
    Rice Tec's Basmati patent also violates provisions of the
Trade Related
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement concerning
'geographical
indications', say anti-biopiracy activists. 
<P>
   Under this, for example, the term 'champagne' can only be used
to
describe wine that has been produced in the Champagne region of
France and
'Scotch' whisky can only be applied to the spirit produced in the
Scottish
highlands. 
<P>
   Basmati rice is also governed by this rule since it is has a
''closely
linked, exclusive relationship with its place of origin on the
Indian
sub-continent,'' says Sharma. 
<P>
   But, India has failed to claim TRIPs protection for Basmati
rice,
Darjeeling tea and other products, he says.
