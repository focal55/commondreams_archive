PORTLAND, Ore.<wbr>--<wbr>The Willamette River, whose citizen-led cleanup in the 1960s
inspired the nation to reclaim its waterways, has become so tainted by
sewage and industrial waste that it faces being listed as a federal
Superfund site--the roster of the country's most polluted places.
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency's Northwest region this week said
it would recommend federal cleanup along a 5.5-mile stretch near Portland
Harbor because Oregon officials had failed to develop an adequate
recovery plan for the nation's 10th-largest river. The announcement was a
stunning blow to a state that prides itself on its ecological conscience.
<p>The designation, if approved by officials in Washington, threatens
Portland Harbor's competitiveness as a major shipping port. And it
virtually guarantees years of litigation over who must pay the cleanup
costs. But some environmental groups hailed the decision, saying it would
push local officials to get on with the job of removing deadly
contaminants from the riverbed.
<p>With the recommended listing, the Willamette joins a growing number of
rivers and harbors to be added to the EPA's 1,226 active Superfund sites.
Many of the new additions were not originally designated because of the
enormous complexity of cleaning them up.
<p>In 1989, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers called the Willamette a
restoration success story, "one of the cleanest streams of comparable
size in the nation." Now, the river that meanders through downtown
Portland is the most polluted waterway in the West in terms of toxic
industrial pollutants, environmental groups said.
<p>"People look at Oregon as the big green state. We've got growth
management, we've got environmental controls. We cleaned up the
Willamette. They're using us in many ways as a prototype. Well, the
prototype's not working," said Joe Coffman of the Willamette Riverkeeper
group.
<b><br>
<p>Amount of Toxins Greatly Increased
</b>
<p>The Willamette flows 187 miles, from the Cascade Mountains above
Eugene to Portland--some of the most pastoral countryside in the nation.
<p>But in a report released this week, Willamette Riverkeeper showed the
amount of toxic chemicals dumped in the river had doubled from 1995 to
1997, to 4.1 million pounds. That includes more than 10,000 pounds of
known carcinogens. A yet-to-be-released report on health risks shows that
Native Americans who daily eat fish from the river stand a 1 in 10 chance
of getting cancer.
<p>What has happened to the Willamette reflects the nature of invisible
chemical pollution--some of it due to the clean, high-tech industries
Portland invited in as antidotes to dirty polluters of the past.
<p>Since the 1930s, Portlanders had railed about the growing filth of the
Willamette, where pulp and steel mills sent globs of sludge floating
downriver and raw sewage left fish unable to breathe. Film shot in the
1960s showed healthy fish dropped into the river flailed and died within
minutes.
<p>Journalist Tom McCall produced a television documentary on the river
so compelling that it helped propel him to the governorship in 1966.
Under his administration, Oregon built sewage treatment plants and
imposed controls on industrial polluters that became models for the 1972
Clean Water Act.
<p>A National Geographic cover story in 1972 celebrated the Willamette's
journey "From Shame to Showcase: A River Restored."
<p>The problem, Oregon officials say, is that decades of pollutants from
old shipbuilding yards, wood creosote factories, coal gasification plants
and oil terminals in the harbor area had settled down into sediment on
the river floor.
<b><br>
<p>Effects of Pollution Found in Wildlife
</b>
<p>In 1987, the EPA did its first major sampling of possible pollution
effects and found high toxicity levels in crayfish. About the same time,
there was a growing awareness that fish in the river were showing
elevated levels of dioxin, one of the Earth's deadliest carcinogens,
produced by pulp mills.
<p>The effects were already showing up in the environment, said Nina
Bell, a lawyer for Northwest Environmental Advocates, who for years has
tried to force the city to halt sewage discharges into the river.
Biologists documented growing reproductive problems in bald eagles, mink
and river otter on the Willamette and the Columbia, which join a few
miles downstream from Portland. There were skeleton deformities in fish.
<p>Regulations were adopted in the late 1980s under which mills cut back
their discharge of dioxin by as much as 95%. State and federal law also
required Oregon's cleaner industries to treat their chemical discharges
before pumping them into the river.
<p>But the EPA does permit release of a certain level of industrial
pollutants into the river. According to the Riverkeeper's report,
semiconductor and related high-tech industries were the second-largest
toxic polluters of the Willamette in 1997.
<p>Widespread farming on the upper Willamette has continued to flood the
river with pesticide and fertilizer residues. And Portland's antiquated
sewer system results in the release of an estimated 3 billion gallons of
untreated sewage into the river each year.
<p>"Everybody thought the river had been recovered. And in certain
respects it had," said Dean Marriott, Portland's director of
environmental services. "What was left were some of the intractable
problems: non-point-source pollution, pollution caused by population
growth, things that are just harder to get your hands around."
<p>Lending urgency to pollution control efforts was the federal
government's announcement last year that every species of salmon and
steelhead native to the Willamette was being listed as threatened.
<p>It is that listing, in part, that has prompted Portland officials to
seek a delay in their plan to build a new sewage system that by 2011 will
nearly eliminate rain-induced overflows into the river. The city already
has reduced overflow 50% since 1991, but officials say that delaying
completion of the project an additional nine years would also allow them
to address the wide variety of urban pollutants that are washing into the
river from streets, lawns, parking lots and agricultural areas.
Environmentalists are bitterly opposed to any delay.
<p>Meanwhile, there is the issue of cleaning up sediment long ago
deposited in the riverbed around Portland Harbor, the subject of the
present Superfund action.
<p>Gov. John Kitzhaber and the city of Portland tried to avoid the
Superfund designation--and the potential bureaucratic nightmare of
federal intervention--by organizing a state-led cleanup effort.
<p>But with about 70 potential polluters involved, the effort foundered.
Companies were reluctant to waive the statute of limitations for paying
some share of cleanup costs when not every firm was willing to make such
a guarantee.
<b><br>
<p>Port of Portland Fears Economic Harm
</b>
<p>The Port of Portland now fears that shipping companies may pass by the
harbor out of worry that a small spill could leave them potentially
liable as partners in a massive cleanup bill.
<p>Moreover, a Superfund designation would threaten the port's plan to
dredge and deepen the river channel to remain viable for increasingly
large commercial ships. The Corps of Engineers under current policy does
not dredge at Superfund sites. Environmental groups have opposed the
dredging of the Willamette and Columbia because of concerns it would stir
up toxic sediments and threaten juvenile salmon.
<p>"We're a niche port now. Our niche could get smaller, and that's at a
time when we expect a tripling of cargo on the West Coast," said David
Lohman, director of policy and planning for the port. "Whenever there's a
Superfund designation, the fear factor of anybody thinking about using
the river goes up."
<p>But Don Francis of the Sierra Club's Portland chapter, a longtime
activist on behalf of the Willamette, said Superfund cleanup could
provide Oregon with the money--and the will--to get the job done.
<p>"The Willamette is kind of the nation's Every River. Virtually every
problem that's affecting rivers in the U.S. is present in the Willamette
watershed," he said. "If Oregon is the environmental leader in the U.S.,
and the environmental leader in the world is the U.S., in a lot of ways,
a lot of hope for what happens in the world is the Willamette. . . . In
the end, there may be no other watershed that has more hope for it."
