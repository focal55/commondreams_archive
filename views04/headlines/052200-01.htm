WASHINGTON  - Forced labour and other human rights
abuses
associated with building natural gas pipelines in Myanmar
(formerly known as
Burma) continue with the knowledge of US and European corporations
which
partially own and manage the projects, according to a new report
released  here
Monday by Earthrights International (ERI).
<P>
''The abuses are not incidental or unrelated to the pipelines -
they are a
direct result of western companies' investments,'' says the
report, 'Total
Denial Continues.' 
<P>
Three prominent companies have invested in the region to construct
pipelines:
Union Oil of California (UNOCAL), and Total, a French company are
involved  in
the Yadana pipeline. And the British company, Premier Oil, is part
of a
consortium building the Yetagun pipeline. 
<P>
The 180-page report is based on first-hand testimony gathered
between 1995  and
2000 from several hundred villagers who claim to either be victims
or
witnesses
- including Burmese army deserters - to recent abuse. 
<P>
Ka Hsaw Wa, a member of Burma's Karen ethnic minority, who is co-
director of
ERI, gathered the interviews which document hundreds of recent
cases of  rape,
execution and confiscation of property carried out by the
military. 
<P>
Most of the testimony revolves around the Yadana pipeline which
was  completed
early this year and has already begun operations.  
<P>
The 1 billion dollar project, operated by a consortium that
includes UNOCAL,
Total and the government of Myanmar, carries natural gas through
Burma to
Thailand. 
<P>
Many people interviewed from Karen, Tavoyan and Mon villages in
the pipeline
regions say the area was never heavily militarised before
construction  began.
Now they claim they are victimised by an army which has been
condemned for  its
abuses by the US State Department, the United Nations, and many
other
organisations. 
<P>
''I wish the foreign companies would go back to their country ...
so the
troops
will go back to Rangoon,'' says one Tavoyan villager interviewed
in 1999. 
<P>
The report also examines reports of forced labour and other rights
abuses
surrounding the 70 million dollar Yetagun gas pipeline. Premier
Oil, acting  as
operator of the project, is part of a consortium currently
developing
off-shore
gas reserves in the Yetagun field in the Gulf of Martaban.á
Yetagun ''is  as
much a problem as the Yadana project, and Premier has surely
benefited as  much
from these crimes as have Total and UNOCAL,'' says the report.  
<P>
"Total Denial Continues" also includes company documents never
before made
public that ERI says prove that corporations knew that forced
labour was  being
employed on their projects. 
<P>
''The companies knew from their own consultants that abuses were
occurring
surrounding their projects, yet they continued involvement,''
according to  the
report.  
<P>
All three companies strongly deny accusations of complicity in
rights  abuses.  
<P>
Charles Jamieson, the Chief Executive of Premier Oil, says he
disagrees with
activists who want to isolate Myanmar.á ''We believe in
constructive
engagement
rather than closing the country off to the world,'' he says.  
<P>
John Imle, former president of UNOCAL, admits that when the
project was  first
being constructed, the military used conscripted labour for
porterage. 
<P>
''I know that in the early days of this project, military units in
the
areas of
the project were using conscripted labour,'' he said. But he says
this does
not
happen anymore. 
<P>
''When I'm visiting these people in these villagers they say,
'We're glad
you're here, please stay,'' says Imle, referring to health and
education
facilities provided by the company.  
<P>
In 1997, United States federal court agreed to hear a lawsuit
brought  against
Unocal and Total by 14 victims for alleged human rights abuses
associated  with
the Yadana project. 
<P>
Federal Judge Richard A. Paez declared that transnational
corporations and
their executive officers can be held legally responsible for
violations of
international human rights law in foreign countries, and that US
courts have
the authority to adjudicate such claims.  
<P>
The decision, contained in a 38-page written order, calls some of
Unocal's
arguments ''inexplicable'' and ''hard to imagine.'' 
<P>
Plaintiffs in the case are represented by a team of lawyers from
ERI, the  New
York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, Hadsell & Stormer and
the Law
offices of Paul Hoffman. The case is seen as ground breaking since
it lays  the
foundation for victims in other countries to sue US corporations
for human
rights violations.  
<P>
Since 1994 activists have been trying to get company shareholders
to approve
resolutions that would force UNOCAL to review its operations in
Myanmar.
But at
each shareholder meeting, the proposals have only received a small
percentage
of the vote.  
<P>
With their protest outside UNOCAL's shareholder meeting near Los
Angeles
Monday, human rights and religious groups, and pro-democracy
Burmese
organisations hope to again draw attention to the issue.
