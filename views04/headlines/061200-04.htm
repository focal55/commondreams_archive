CALGARY, ALBERTA - Protesters streamed through Calgary's downtown yesterday as a meeting of the world's top petroleum power brokers began.
<P>Dozens of police officers kept close watch on the afternoon parade as more than 2,000 marchers snaked through the city's core in an attempt to drive home their opposition to energy-sector practices as World Petroleum Congress delegates gathered.</P>
<P>A police perimeter, enforced by 2.4-metre high fences, was set up early yesterday, which made the area where delegates gathered seem more like a ghost town than the core of a large city. Police officials were tight-lipped about how many officers are involved in security, but their ranks are bolstered by municipal forces within Alberta and by Mounties from all four western provinces.</P>
<P>Some protesters thought the heavy police presence -- there seemed to be a group of officers on every corner in the city's hub -- was oppressive and an attempt at intimidation.</P>
<P>&#34;This is really an overkill,&#34; said Sandy Ervin, a 57-year-old anthropology professor at the University of Saskatchewan, who came for a sustainable-alternatives teach-in held on Friday and Saturday. &#34;Here we've got all these bigwigs coming from all over the world and we're being squelched.&#34;</P>
<P>Police Chief Christine Silverberg, said her officers would use force appropriate to whatever circumstances they encounter.</P>
<P>&#34;When public safety is at risk we will take firm and professional action,&#34; she said.</P>
<P>While the situation was largely calm yesterday, police seized at least three &#34;weapons&#34; -- a squeegee-type stick with blades on the ends, a railway-type spike and a baseball bat.</P>
<P>Last evening a few hundred people gathered at the security fence and chanted at a line of police officers. Some rattled the fence as the officers looked on.</P>
<P>Demonstrators said they purposefully tried to keep the tone calm in the face of local media coverage that seemed to whip up fear that the disaffected would cause riots. That restraint may change today as several protesters vowed to make a splash with various forms of civil disobedience.</P>
<P>Calgary's police force has spent months planning for the mass street gatherings that have become regular fixtures on the international meeting circuit and have studied the strategies recently used in Seattle, Washington and Windsor, Ont.</P>
<P>For days, protesters have been making placards and developing strategies at a camp in abandoned buildings near the city's Stampede grounds. Some, who are veterans of rallies in Seattle, Washington and Windsor, gave lessons on what to do during an arrest and how to minimize the effects of pepper spray.</P>
<P>Congress organizers and delegates were supportive of the rights of individuals to demonstrate peacefully. But they underline that delegates also should be free to go about their business without interruption.</P>
<P>&#34;Freedom of speech is something that I believe in personally,&#34; said Jim Gray, chairman of the Canadian organizing committee for the WPC. &#34;My only concern is that the magnet of what might or might not happen and the excitement of it and the dynamics of it seems to override some of the marvelous things that are going to happen here.&#34;</P>
<P>Mr. Gray, a leading figure in the province's oil patch, said no delegates have cancelled because of security anxieties or even expressed concern about the issue.</P>
<P>Prime Minister Jean Chr&#233;tien said he was not bothered by the protesters.</P>
<P>&#34;You know freedom of speech exists, they have the right to protest,&#34; he told reporters after a private meeting yesterday afternoon with Alberta Premier Ralph Klein.</P>
<P>&#34;I organized some of that when I was a kid but we have to do it in the respect of the law and the freedom of others.&#34;</P>
<P>Mr. Klein cautioned the protesters not to disrupt the daily routine of the city.</P>
<P>&#34;Make your point -- fine that's what it's all about,&#34; Mr. Klein said. &#34;But don't get in the way of people doing their day-to-day business and what they want to do.&#34;</P>
<P>The 16th World Petroleum Congress officially opened last night with a ceremony and remarks by Mr. Chr&#233;tien and Mr. Klein.</P>
<P>The conference is an international gathering of top-ranking officials from the global oil-and-gas industry who meet every three years to discuss related issues and do business. There are 2,850 delegates, plus about 500 spouses, hailing from 95 countries. The numbers are boosted by 300 media and hundreds more exhibitors in a concurrent trade show, for a total of about 4,300 participants.</P>
<P>The meeting, which runs until Thursday, has never been held in Canada before.
