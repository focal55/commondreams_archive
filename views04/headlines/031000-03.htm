Dear [Corporate Client]:<br>
<br>

Enclosed is our "Guide to the Seattle Meltdown: A Compendium of
Activists at the WTO Ministerial". The "Guide" is a comprehensive
listing of the activist groups which protested against the WTO
Ministerial in Seattle this past November. It lists the groups and their
leaders we were able to identify, descriptions of their ethos (largely
in their own words), as well as web site addresses and other useful
information. We wanted to share this "Guide" with you, not so much as a
retrospective on the past, but as an alarming window on the future.<br>
<br>

The spectacle created in Seattle during the WTO Ministerial meeting by a
diverse collection of activists may have significant short-term
ramifications for the business community. The perceived success of these
groups in disrupting Seattle and in contributing to the failure of the
WTO meeting will be a dramatic boon to them in several ways. First,
their victory and heightened visibility will lead to substantially
enhanced fundraising capability. Second, the smell of victory will lead
to a deepening of already existing coalitions and will strengthen the
recognition that broadening such coalitions to include non-traditional
allies exponentially increases effectiveness. Third, the Presidential
election campaign and several likely trade votes in Congress this year
will give activists golden opportunities to seek wider recognition and
gain additional strength. These high profile battles will allow
activists to further institutionalize and consolidate their gains,
increase coordination, gamier greater media attention and expand their
targeting of business interests.<br>
<br>

What is less understood -- but perhaps more significant -- is the
potential ability of the emerging coalition of these groups to seriously
impact broader, longer-term corporate interests. Seattle was not an
anomaly and the consistent anti-corporate message of virtually all the
groups who participated there in November is not a temporary phenomenon.
Many have traditionally highlighted alleged corporate misconduct in mass
mail fund raising campaigns. More recently, some environmental groups
have resorted to targeting corporations for contributions in return for
suspending their public ire.<br>
<br>

At Black, Kelly, Scruggs & Healey, we have developed a capability
direction of these groups, as well as to defend clients against their
attacks. I hope you find the enclosed "Guide" useful and if you have any
questions, please call me at: (202) 530-4805.<br>
<br>

Sincerely,<br>
<br>

<i>"Many of the groups that helped organize the anti-WTO victories in
Seattle are already preparing for days of protest, education, training,
and direct action during the week of April 9-16 in Washington. The week
begins on Sunday, April 9th with a Jubilee 2000/USA mobilization for
cancellation of the debts of African, Latin American, Asia-Pacific, and
Caribbean countries, and continuing with teach-ins and trainings on the
global economy. It will culminate with a massive rally at IMF
Headquarters on Sunday, April 16th 
2000."</i><br>

<i>"Leaders of the peaceful demonstrations have lashed out at the
anarchists, accusing them of undermining their anti-globalism message by
breaking windows and destroying property. The anarchists in turn accused
the Seattle protesters of protecting the same private-property interests
that the WTO represents.&quot;</i><br>
