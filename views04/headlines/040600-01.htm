MUENSTER, Germany<wbr>--<wbr>If character can be judged by the company one keeps, Americans are
running with what Europeans see as a dangerously rough crowd that still
practices capital punishment.
<P>Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and China are among the few
countries that still invoke the death penalty to punish those deemed of
no further social value.
<P>Especially in this U.S. election year, when the pace of executions has
accelerated and even liberal candidates fear to criticize what Europeans
see as a policy of "kill to win," disgust with the Americans'
eye-for-an-eye approach is not only growing but moving from ethical
upbraids to economic interventions.
<P>But the more strident protests have mostly given rise to greater
frustration, as those morally opposed to the taking of life as a form of
state punishment find their actions are not only ineffective but often
counterproductive.
<P>When a women's group in Sweden last fall called for a boycott of
California wines in protest of the state's corrections and execution
policies, the show of outrage was headline news in Stockholm but only
hardened Sacramento's resolve to prevent the transfer of a Swedish
prisoner to her homeland. Swedes gave up the attack on their country's
$770 million in trade with the Golden State because it was undermining
bilateral negotiations, says Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Monica
Lundquist.
<P>In Italy, a campaign by the Benetton fashion empire featuring
condemned U.S. murderers on advertising billboards cost the company a
lucrative marketing deal with 400 stores of Sears, Roebuck & Co. Sears,
the Italian company's biggest foothold in the U.S. market, canceled its
retail agreement with Benetton after weeping relatives of victims of the
profiled death-row inmates picketed stores in New York and Houston.
<P>German intellectuals convinced that racism underlies the death
sentence against former Black Panthers activist Mumia Abu-Jamal in
Pennsylvania have been urging--to no avail--German businesses such as the
Haribo candy company that makes Gummi Bears to pull their investments out
of the state.
<P>French and German opponents of capital punishment, which is outlawed
throughout the 41 countries in the Council of Europe, have sought to
exert pressure with fund-raising drives to finance appeals for condemned
prisoners and with petitions demanding an end to what they deem a
barbaric practice.
<P>In this university town in northwestern Germany, politicians and
academics have joined forces to mobilize churches and human rights groups
to come up with more effective measures for convincing U.S. citizens that
they shalt not kill.
<P>"This is baffling for us. While countries like Russia and Turkey are
agreeing to abolish the death penalty, the United States, which has
always claimed to stand for democracy, freedom and morality, still
refuses to do so," says Klaus Langmann, a Muenster University mathematics
professor and co-founder of Amnesty International in Germany. Russia and
Turkey, widely criticized for their human rights records, have agreed to
cease executions in return for inclusion in European alliances.
<P>Ruprecht Polenz, a conservative who represents Muenster in the federal
parliament in Berlin, attributes the ideological gulf between the United
States and Western Europe on capital punishment to their dramatically
different histories over the past century.
<P>"Our views have been shaped by the experience of the Third Reich, when
the potential for abuse was so horribly apparent in the state's right to
decide matters of life and death," says the Christian Democrat, who sits
on the foreign policy committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament.
<P>German distress over U.S. executions hit a high point last year when
two German-born brothers, Karl and Walter LaGrand, were put to death for
a 1982 murder in Arizona. Three other Germans also await execution in
Arizona and Florida, but the cause here transcends national interests. In
Germany, as throughout Europe, groups dedicated to fighting racism and
injustice have made household names of condemned Americans such as Andrea
Hicks Jackson, who is awaiting execution in Florida, and Abu-Jamal, both
convicted in the slayings of police officers.
<P>When U.S. presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush of Texas refused
to stay the execution of 31-year-old Odell Barnes in early March--the
122nd execution he authorized since becoming governor--European anger
soared. Influential leaders from Pope John Paul II to French President
Jacques Chirac had urged Bush to cease what many of their followers see
as a campaign tactic to cast himself as tough on crime.
<P>"This is one of the most disturbing aspects of legalized executions:
the potential for misuse, this kill-to-win strategy that has every
candidate too afraid of losing votes to speak out on humanitarian
grounds," says Swiss sociologist Margrit Sprecher.
<P>Sprecher, who spent months interviewing condemned inmates in
Huntsville, Texas, for a book published in German last year, "Living and
Dying on Death Row," ties the strong support among Americans for capital
punishment--more than 70% by most measures--to their concept of victims'
rights and indulgence of revenge.
<P>Italians have turned to efforts at positive reinforcement in their
campaign against the death penalty, bolstered by both the overwhelming
adherence to Catholicism and a deep distrust of the state. Rome lights up
the Colosseum for 48 hours each time an execution is commuted or
postponed anywhere in the world. Only two of the dozen illuminations over
the past three months have been in celebration of U.S. actions--one a
stay of execution in North Carolina and the other for Illinois' decision
to suspend the death penalty pending review of numerous suspect
convictions.
<P>Although popular revulsion escalates in Europe with each U.S.
execution, politicians across the spectrum contend that their instruments
for affecting American public opinion are few and mostly ineffective.
<P>"We have to agree to disagree. There's nothing else on the table,"
says Gert Weisskirchen, foreign policy spokesman for legislators from
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party.
<P>Greens legislator Claudia Roth, who chairs the human rights and
humanitarian support committee of the Bundestag, says she is proud of the
democratic evolution of her country to a point where the majority of
Germans define the death penalty as abhorrent.
<P>"I spoke with a woman whose son had been murdered, and she told me she
wanted to see his killer die, that she wanted revenge, but that she was
later glad the law prevented her from succumbing to those crude
instincts," Roth recalls. "I think we are better people when we give
every person the chance to redeem himself."
<P>Conservatives such as Karl Lamers, foreign policy point man for the
Christian Democratic Union, say they see little short-term hope of
persuading the U.S. to abolish the death penalty despite the
embarrassing, dictatorial company that Americans are forced to keep on
the subject.
<P>"The United States is the spiritual father of Europe. Its forces
defended us for decades against the Russian threat. There's only so far
we can go in criticizing the country that brought us back into the
democratic fold after 1945," Lamers says. "But for a country with the
cultural credentials of the United States, this is behavior that the rest
of the civilized world considers inappropriate."
