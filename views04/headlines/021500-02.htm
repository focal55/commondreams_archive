<p>PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - U.S. doctors who once believed that
sterilization could help rid society of mental illness and crime
launched a 20th century eugenics movement that in some ways
paralleled the policies of Nazi Germany, researchers said on
Monday.
<p>A Yale study tracing a once-popular movement aimed at
improving society through selective breeding, indicates that
state-authorized sterilizations were carried out longer and on a
larger scale in the United States than previously believed,
beginning with the first state eugenics law in Indiana in 1907.
<p>Despite modern assumptions that American interest in
eugenics waned during the 1920s, researchers said sterilization
laws had authorized the neutering of more than 40,000 people
classed as insane or ``feebleminded'' in 30 states by 1944.
<p>Another 22,000 underwent sterilization from the mid-1940s to
1963, despite weakening public support and revelations of Nazi
atrocities, according to the study, funded by the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Merck Co. Foundation.
<p>Forced sterilization was legal in 18 U.S. states, and most
states with eugenics laws allowed people to be sterilized
without their consent by leaving the decision to a third party.
<p>``The comparative histories of the eugenical sterilization
campaigns in the United States and Nazi Germany reveal important
similarities of motivation, intent and strategy,'' the study's
authors wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a journal
published by the American College of Physicians-American Society
of Internal Medicine.
<p>Eugenics sprang from the philosophy of social Darwinism,
which envisioned human society in terms of natural selection and
suggested that science could engineer progress by attacking
supposedly hereditary problems including moral decadence, crime,
venereal disease, tuberculosis and alcoholism.
<p>``The eugenics laws in the United States were virulent, just
as they were in Sweden, France and Australia,'' said Art Caplan,
head of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics.
<p>The U.S. practice ended in the 1960s after being overwhelmed
by court challenges and the civil rights movement.
<p>German and American eugenics advocates both believed science
could solve social problems, tended to measure the worth of the
individual in economic terms and felt mental illness a threat to
society grave enough to warrant compulsive sterilization.
<p>And while Nazi claims of Aryan superiority are well known,
researchers said U.S. advocates of sterilization worried that
the survival of old-stock America was being threatened by the
influx of ``lower races'' from southern and eastern Europe.
<p>There was also mutual admiration, with early U.S. policies
drawing glowing reviews from authorities in pre-Nazi Germany.
<p>``Germany is perhaps the most progressive nation in
restricting fecundity among the unfit,'' editors of the New
England Journal of Medicine wrote in 1934, a year after Hitler
became chancellor.
<p><font size=+1><font size="3">U.S. Eugenics Movement Waned</font></font>
<p>But the study, based partly on old editorials from the New
England journal and the Journal of the American Medical
Association, also demonstrated how the U.S. eugenics movement
gradually waned while its Nazi counterpart carried out 360,000
to 375,000 sterilizations during the 1930s and grew to encompass
so-called ``mercy'' killings.
<p>``In the United States, a combination of public unease,
Roman Catholic opposition, federal democracy, judicial review
and critical scrutiny by the medical profession reversed the
momentum,'' the article said.
<p>The U.S. practice of neutering ``mentally defective''
individuals was backed by most leading geneticists and often
justified on grounds that it would relieve the public of the
cost of caring for future generations of the mentally ill.
<p>Sterilizations also took place mainly in public mental
institutions, where the poor and ethnic or racial minorities
were housed in disproportionately high numbers.
<p>``It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to
execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve
for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are
manifestly unfit from continuing their kind,'' Supreme Court
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in the majority opinion of a
landmark eugenics case in 1926.
