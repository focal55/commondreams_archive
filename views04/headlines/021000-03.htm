<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent executions of three juvenile offenders is a stunning indication
of how far America has fallen from its position as the world's champion of
children's and human rights. For years, the United States has been using
economic sanctions and incentives to force other countries to comply with
established standards of human decency; so shouldn't these executions trigger
similar domestic and international action against the U.S. and the states that
continue to execute juvenile offenders?</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   The State of Virginia executed Douglas Christopher Thomas and Steven Roach
on January 10th and 13th, and Texas executed Glen McGinnis on January 25th.
The executions were carried out despite appeals from the European Union, the
American Bar Association and even Pope John Paul II, who asked Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas to commute McGinnis' sentence to life in prison. Waiting in the
wings are approximately 70 other juvenile offenders on Death Rows across the
country.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One hundred years ago, America led the international community in its
thinking about how to treat children in trouble with the law, creating the
world's first juvenile court. Outraged by the treatment of children in prisons
and following the lessons of the nascent human sciences, reformers created a
system based on the notion that children were developmentally different than
adults. They recognized that adolescence is a transitional period of life
where cognitive abilities, judgment, impulse control and identity are still
being developed.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   In creating juvenile courts, Americans recognized the simple truth that
adolescents are simply less culpable than adults for their misdeeds while
being more amenable to rehabilitative treatment. By 1925, 46 states had
created separate courts for children as did many other countries, including
most of Europe as well as Canada, Argentina, India, Madagascar, Japan and
Brazil.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Fifty years later, in the wake of the Nazi atrocities, this country once
again led the international community, this time in the field of human rights.
The United States was instrumental in drafting the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the bedrock document articulating the most fundamental
principles of human rights.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   But America has become increasingly out of step with the rest of the world
in its policies with regard to human rights and in particular, its treatment
of troubled children. Nothing demonstrates this more than the atavistic and
barbaric policy of executing juvenile offenders.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   The United States is in the company of only six other countries known to
have executed juvenile offenders in the last decade--Yemen, China, Iran,
Nigeria, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. China and Yemen have recently outlawed the
practice. In the 1990s, Amnesty International documented 19 cases of child
offenders who were executed. Ten were executed in the United States--more than
all of the other countries combined.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   The United States has had many opportunities to join the global consensus
against executing juveniles. A total of 191 countries--all but the United
States and the collapsed state of Somalia--have ratified the 10-year-old
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which forbids the death
penalty against persons under the age of 18. The U.S. also has specifically
reserved its right to ignore the ban on executing juveniles contained in the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   It is indeed ironic that a country that views itself as the human rights
champion of the world--a country that leads international efforts to ban child
labor abuses and to promote child health--nevertheless retains the practice of
executing juvenile offenders. Yet the U.S. government refuses to take a stand
against the execution of juveniles in deference to the right of individual
states to set the minimum age for execution. Out of 38 death penalty states,
23 allow the death penalty for children under 18.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   What will it take to get these states to stop executing minors? Appealing
to the hearts and minds of state legislators and governors doesn't seem to
work in an age when getting "tough on crime" is more politically expedient.
Such efforts have failed to stop the executions of children and mentally
retarded adults in the past.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Perhaps the only road to change is to borrow a page from the United States'
playbook when it comes to human rights violators--exert economic pressure.
Domestic and international corporations might want to reconsider relocating or
investing in states that execute adolescent offenders. Investors and consumers
might add this factor into their decision making. Indeed, an organized
economic boycott of South Carolina is forcing that state to seriously
reconsider flying the Confederate flag at its state capitol.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Already, the 15 countries of the European Union, all of which have outlawed
the death penalty, have begun to exert some pressure. In July 1998, in a
letter to Gov. Bush of Texas, the chairman of the European Parliament's
Delegation for Relations warned that many European companies, under pressure
from their shareholders, were considering restricting their investments in
states that apply the death penalty. The European Parliament, which ratifies
foreign trade accords and has final authority over the European Union's
budget, controls billions of dollars in foreign investment.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   In the new "global economy," where economic interdependence is critical,
the United States, and its individual states, will need to compete more
aggressively for more investment and trade from both domestic and
international sources. This reliance could give consumers, investors,
corporations and foreign governments greater leverage in influencing human
rights policies within the United States. There can be no better place to
start exercising this economic muscle than in persuading the states to cease
executing juvenile offenders.</font>
