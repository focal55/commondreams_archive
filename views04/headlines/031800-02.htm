<p>Many people remember reading George Orwell's 
"Animal Farm" in high school or college, with its 
chilling finale in which the farm animals looked back and 
forth at the tyrannical pigs and the exploitative human 
farmers but found it "impossible to say which was 
which."

<p> That ending was altered in the 1955 animated version, which removed the humans, leaving only the nasty pigs. Another example of 
Hollywood butchering great 
literature? Yes, but in this 
case the film's secret producer was the Central Intelligence Agency.

<p> The C.I.A., it seems, 
was worried that the public 
might be too influenced by 
Orwell's pox-on-both-their-houses critique of the capitalist humans and Communist pigs. So after his death 
in 1950, agents were dispatched (by none other than E. 
Howard Hunt, later of Watergate fame) to buy the film 
rights to "Animal Farm" from his widow to make its 
message more overtly anti-Communist.

<p> Rewriting the end of "Animal Farm" is just one 
example of the often absurd lengths to which the C.I.A. 
went, as recounted in a new book, "The Cultural Cold 
War: The C.I.A. and the World of Arts and Letters" (The 
New Press) by Frances Stonor Saunders, a British 
journalist. Published in Britain last summer, the book 
will appear here next month.

<p> Much of what Ms. Stonor Saunders writes about, 
including the C.I.A.'s covert sponsorship of the Paris-based Congress for Cultural Freedom and the British 
opinion magazine Encounter, was exposed in the late 
1960's, generating a wave of indignation. But by combing 
through archives and unpublished manuscripts and interviewing several of the principal actors, Ms. Stonor 
Saunders has uncovered many new details and gives the 
most comprehensive account yet of the agency's activities  between 1947 and 1967.

<p> This picture of the C.I.A.'s secret war of ideas has 
cameo appearances by scores of intellectual celebrities 
like the critics Dwight Macdonald and Lionel Trilling, the 
poets Ted Hughes and Derek Walcott and the novelists 
James Michener and Mary McCarthy, all of whom 
directly or indirectly benefited from the C.I.A.'s largesse. There are also bundles of cash that were funneled 
through C.I.A. fronts and several hilarious schemes that 
resemble  a "Spy vs. Spy" cartoon more than a serious  
defense against Communism.

<p> Traveling first class all the way, 
the C.I.A. and its counterparts in 
other Western European nations 
sponsored art exhibitions, intellectual conferences, concerts and magazines to press their larger anti-Soviet 
agenda. Ms. Stonor Saunders provides ample evidence, for example, 
that the editors at Encounter and 
other agency-sponsored magazines 
were ordered not to publish articles 
directly critical of Washington's foreign policy. She also shows how the 
C.I.A. bankrolled some of the earliest 
exhibitions of Abstract Expressionist painting outside of the United 
States to counter the Socialist Realism being advanced by Moscow.

<p> In one memorable episode, the 
British Foreign Office subsidized the 
distribution of 50,000 copies of 
"Darkness at Noon," Arthur Koestler's anti-Communist classic. But at 
the same time, the French Communist Party ordered its operatives to 
buy up every copy of the book. Koestler received a windfall in royalties 
courtesy of his Communist adversaries.

<p> As it turns out, "Animal Farm" 
was not the only instance of the 
C.I.A.'s  dabbling in Hollywood. Ms. 
Stonor Saunders reports that one operative who was a producer and talent agent slipped affluent-looking African-Americans into several films 
as extras to try to counter Soviet 
criticism of the American race problem.

<p> The agency also changed the ending of the movie version of "1984," 
disregarding Orwell's specific instructions that the story not be altered. In the book, the protagonist, 
Winston Smith, is entirely defeated 
by the nightmarish totalitarian regime. In the very last line, Orwell 
writes of Winston, "He loved Big 
Brother." In the movie, Winston and 
his lover, Julia, are gunned down 
after Winston defiantly shouts: 
"Down with Big Brother!"

<p> Such changes came from the agency's obsession with snuffing out a 
notion then popular among many European intellectuals: that East and 
West were morally equivalent. But 
instead of illustrating the differences 
between the two competing systems 
by taking the high road, the agency 
justified its covert activities by referring to the unethical tactics of the 
Soviets.

<p> "If the other side can use ideas 
that are camouflaged as being local 
rather than Soviet-supported or -stimulated, then we ought to be able 
to use ideas camouflaged as local 
ideas,"  Tom Braden, who ran the 
C.I.A.'s covert cultural division in the 
early 1950's, explained years later. 
(In one of the book's many  amusing 
codas, Mr. Braden goes on in the 
1980's to become the leftist foil to 
Patrick Buchanan on the CNN program "Crossfire.")

<p> The cultural cold war began in 
postwar Europe, with the fraying of 
the wartime alliance between Washington and Moscow. Officials in the 
West believed they had to counter 
Soviet propaganda and undermine 
the wide sympathy for Communism 
in France and Italy.

<p> An odd alliance was struck between the C.I.A. leaders, most of 
them wealthy Ivy League veterans 
of the wartime Office of Strategic 
Services and a corps of largely Jewish ex-Communists who had broken 
with Moscow to become virulently 
anti-Communist. Acting as intermediaries between the agency and the 
intellectual community were three 
colorful agents who included Vladimir Nabokov's much less talented  
cousin, Nicholas, a composer.

<p> The C.I.A. recognized from the beginning that it could not openly sponsor artists and intellectuals in Europe because there was so much 
anti-American feeling there. Instead, 
it decided to woo intellectuals out of 
the Soviet orbit by secretly promoting a non-Communist left of democratic socialists disillusioned with 
Moscow.

<p> Ms. Stonor Saunders describes 
how the C.I.A. cleverly skimmed 
hundreds of millions of dollars from 
the Marshall Plan to finance its activities, funneling the money through 
fake philanthropies it created or real 
ones like the Ford Foundation.

<p> "We couldn't spend it all," Gilbert 
Greenway, a former C.I.A. agent, recalled. "There were no limits, and 
nobody had to account for it. It was 
amazing."

<p> When some of the C.I.A.'s activities were exposed in the late 1960's, 
many artists and intellectuals 
claimed ignorance. But Ms. Stonor 
Saunders makes a strong case that 
several people, including the philosopher Isaiah Berlin and the poet Stephen Spender, who was co-editor of 
Encounter, knew about the C.I.A.'s 
role.

<p> "She has made it very difficult 
now to deny that some of these things 
happened," said Norman Birnbaum, 
a professor at the Georgetown University Law School who was a university professor in Europe in the 
1950's and early 1960's. "And she has 
placed a lot of people living and dead 
in embarrassing situations."

<p> Still unresolved is what impact the 
campaign had and whether it was 
worth it. Some of the participants, 
like Arthur M.   
<p>Schlesinger Jr., who 
was in the O.S.S. and knew about 
some of the C.I.A.'s cultural activities, argue that the agency's role was 
benign, even necessary. Compared 
with the coups the C.I.A. sponsored in 
Guatemala, Iran and elsewhere, he 
said, its support of the arts was some 
of its best work. "It enabled people to 
publish what they already believed," 
he added. "It didn't change anyone's 
course of action or thought."

<p> But Diana Josselson, whose husband, Michael, ran the Congress for 
Cultural Freedom, told Ms. Stonor 
Saunders that there were real human costs among those around the 
world who innocently cooperated 
with the agency's front organizations 
only to be tarred with a C.I.A. affiliation when the truth came out. The 
author and other critics argue that 
by using government money covertly to promote such American 
ideals as democracy and freedom of 
expression, the agency ultimately 
stepped on its own message.

<p> "Obviously it was an error, and a 
rather serious error, to allow intellectuals to be subsidized by the government," said Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University. "And when it was revealed, it did 
undermine their credibility seriously."
