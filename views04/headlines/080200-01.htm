PHILADELPHIA - Scores 
of protesters were arrested in a running cat-and-mouse contest with the 
police across downtown thoroughfares today as they sought to disrupt 
the Republican National Convention 
with illegal hit-and-run demonstrations. 

<p>  The evening rush-hour traffic was 
turned into gridlock around City Hall 
as hundreds of young demonstrators, 
some of them masked with bandannas, blocked a main entrance of the 
interstate highway and strutted as 
they pleased at key points in the city, 
clogging intersections with only selective interference from the police.

</TABLE></font>With the city intent on maintaining 
an upbeat convention gleam, the police clearly worked to avoid the sort 
of full-scale, baton-wielding clashes 
with street demonstrators that occurred last winter at the World 
Trade Organization conference and 
damaged Seattle's reputation. Demonstrators, on the other hand, clearly 
worked to steal the media spotlight 
and create street scenes of nonstop 
political protest as the focus for the 
15,000 news workers here covering 
the Republican convention. 

<p>      The convention, three miles away, 
remained unfazed. But delegates increasingly watched the local television coverage of protests out beyond 
their meeting through the slower 
parts of their agenda. Some delegates reported inconvenience in journeying around protest-clogged 
streets to reach the convention arena 
in South Philadelphia. But none were 
heard demanding a more hard-edged 
response from city authorities.

<p>      The Associated Press reported 
that at least 280 people had been 
taken into custody last night. The 
police said that  four officers were 
injured and 20 patrol car windows 
smashed across the day of increasing disruption. A score of demonstrators, chanting denunciations of capital punishment, were arrested after 
blocking the westbound entrance to 
the interstate Vine Street Expressway north of City Hall.

<p>      "The whole world is watching!" 
they screamed, echoing the protest 
of the 1968 anti-war demonstrators 
on the chaotic streets around the 
Democratic convention in Chicago.

<p>      And, indeed, the police seemed 
well aware of who was watching. 
They carefully read arrest warnings 
three times, then gingerly arrested 
the sit-in demonstrators while five 
news helicopters hovered  and a platoon of reporters and photographers 
stood within a few feet.

<p>      Protesters representing a score of 
causes seemed energized by the day, 
the most tense and chaotic thus far in 
the convention week. They vowed to 
deploy their darting street tactics 
further over  the next two days.

<p>      "Ridiculous," one delegate angrily 
muttered outside the Doubletree Hotel south of City Hall as his path was 
momentarily blocked by a swirl of 
demonstrators, police officers and 
news workers tying up Broad Street.

<p>                  "They're just rebels without a 
cause," declared Erik Lipson, a 38-year-old resident with tickets for the 
evening convention session. He 
watched a two-hour standoff between the police and protesters and 
was ultimately branded "bourgeoisie" by one demonstrator. "A bunch 
of spoiled suburban kids," Mr. Lipson continued as demonstrators attracted more and more attention. 

<p>          The American Civil Liberties 
Union accused  the police of precipitating the uglier street mood today 
by raiding a West Philadelphia warehouse where protesters were preparing props and puppets for passive-resistance demonstrations. 

<p>      The police, to the contrary, said 
the warehouse was raided  because it 
was being used as the planning headquarters for illegal disruptions of the 
convention week.

<p>          Late tonight, the best evidence police could cite was that chicken wire 
and plastic tubing were found in the 
warehouse, which they contended 
were the ingredients of illegal protest material. Civil rights critics 
seized upon this as evidence only of 
gross over-reaction.

<p>      "Police Commissioner John Timoney has taken off the velvet gloves to 
show the iron fist," said Stefan 
Presser, legal director of the state 
A.C.L.U.

<p>  Mr. Presser referred to the contrast between the increasing tensions of today and the scene on Monday when the police chose to escort, 
rather than confront, welfare protesters in an illegal march for three 
miles down Broad Street. 

<p>      Mr. Presser insisted the warehouse raid was provocative while the 
police said it was necessary. At the 
same time he deplored reports of 
some demonstrators resorting to 
vandalism and setting trash fires as 
they raced through the streets.

<p>   "The whole city loses if this situation deteriorates," he warned.   
<p> 

<p>       Commissioner Timoney has repeatedly said that the police will be 
flexible in their response to unexpected protests and provocations. 
But the city has also emphasized that 
it must protect public safety and the 
conventioneers' peace. It has made 
provisions for thousands of arrests 
and detentions. Thousands of police 
officers were at the ready, with bike 
squads closely tailing most of the 
demonstrators but not arresting 
them as they impulsively went off on 
fresh tangents in their protests.
