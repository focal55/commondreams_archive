<p>A respected creator of the Information Age has written an 
extraordinary critique of accelerating technological change in which 
he suggests that new technologies could cause &quot;something like 
extinction'' of humankind within the next two generations.	 
</P>
<P>  The alarming prediction, intended to be provocative, is striking 
because it comes not from a critic of technology but rather from a 
man who invented much of it: Bill Joy, chief scientist and co-founder 
of Sun Microsystems Inc., the leading Web technology manufacturer.	 
</P>
<P>  Joy was an original co-chairman of a presidential commission on 
the future of information technology. His warning, he said in a 
telephone interview, is meant to be reminiscent of Albert Einstein's 
famous 1939 letter to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt alerting 
him to the possibility of an atomic bomb.	 
</P>
<P>  In a 24-page article in the Wired magazine that will appear on the 
Web tomorrow, Joy says he finds himself essentially agreeing, to his 
horror, with a core argument of the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski -- 
that advanced technology poses a threat to the human species.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I have always believed that making software more reliable, given 
its many uses, will make the world a safer and better place,'' Joy 
wrote in the article, which he worked on for six months. ``If I were 
to come to believe the opposite, then I would be morally obligated to 
stop this work. I can now imagine that such a day may come.''	 
</P>
<P>  Joy enjoys a level-headed reputation in the industry. ``Nobody is 
more phlegmatic than Bill,'' said Stewart Brand, an Internet pioneer. 
``He is the adult in the room.''	 
</P>
<P>  Joy is disturbed by a suite of advances. He views as credible the 
prediction that by 2030, computers will be a million times more 
powerful than they are today. He respects the possibility that robots 
may exceed humans in intelligence, while being able to replicate 
themselves.	 
</p>
<b>INEXPENSIVE SMART MACHINES</b>
<P>  He points to nanotechnology -- the emerging science that attempts 
to create any desired object on an atom-by-atom basis -- and agrees 
that it has the potential to allow inexpensive production of smart 
machines so small they could fit inside a blood vessel. Genetic 
technology, meanwhile, is inexorably generating the power to create 
new forms of life that could reproduce.	 
</P>
<P>  What deeply worries him is that these technologies collectively 
create the ability to unleash self-replicating, mutating, mechanical 
or biological plagues. These would be ``a replication attack in the 
physical world'' comparable to the replication attack in the virtual 
world that recently caused the shutdowns of major commercial Web 
sites.	 
</P>
<P>  ``If you can let something loose that can make more copies of 
itself,'' Joy said in a telephone interview, ``it is very difficult 
to recall. It is as easy as eradicating all the mosquitoes: They are 
everywhere and make more of themselves. If attacked, they mutate and 
become immune. . . . That creates the possibility of empowering 
individuals for extreme evil. If we don't do anything, the risk is 
very high of one crazy person doing something very bad.''	 
</P>
<P>  What further concerns him is the huge profits from any single 
advance that may seem beneficial in itself.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It is always hard to see the bigger impact while you are in the 
vortex of a change,'' Joy wrote. ``We have long been driven by the 
overarching desire to know that is the nature of science's quest, not 
stopping to notice that the progress to newer and more powerful 
technologies can take on a life of its own.''	 
</P>
<P>  Finally, he argues, this threat to humanity is much greater than 
that of nuclear weapons because those are hard to build. By contrast, 
he says, these new technologies are not hard to come by. Therefore, 
he reasons, the problem will not be ``rogue states, but rogue 
individuals.''	 
</P>
<P>  Joy acknowledges that to some people, this may all sound like 
science fiction. ``After Y2K didn't happen,'' he said, ``some people 
will feel free to dismiss this, saying everything will work out.''	 
</P>
<P>  Joy is less clear on how such a scenario could be prevented. When 
asked how he personally would stop this progression, he stumbled. 
``Sun has always struggled with being an ethical innovator,'' he 
said. ``We are tool builders. I'm trailing off here.''
