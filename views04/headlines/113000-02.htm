RIO DE JANEIRO  - The international trafficking of
human beings, especially of women who are then forced into
prostitution, represents the world's third largest area of
organised crime, and a business that produces seven billion
dollars annually.
<P>
   Greater illegal profits are found only in the drugs and arms
trades, according to data from the United Nations Office for Drug
Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP), released during the
International Seminar on Trafficking in Human Beings, in the
Brazilian capital this week. 
<P>
   Every year, nearly one million women worldwide are victims of
the activity - which amounts to slavery -, says the ODCCP, whose
executive director, Pino Arlacchi, took part in the two-day
seminar ended Wednesday. 
<P>
   Brazil's role in the phenomenon can be seen in the 75,000 women
currently involved in the sex trade in the European Union,
according to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, a non-
governmental organisation in Finland. 
<P>
   Spain is the top destination for such women, who are usually
attracted by offers of employment, good wages and other benefits.
Once they arrive, the smugglers confiscate their passports and
force them to pay back the airline ticket, and other supposed
''travel expenses,'' through prostitution. 
<P>
   Nearly all women - 95 percent - are tricked in similar ways and
subjected to degrading living conditions, according to the Finnish
study. 
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics available to give a precise
idea of the scope of the problem, acknowledged police agents, UN
experts and diplomats participating in the conference. In addition
to being illegal and clandestine, the practice of smuggling
migrants benefits from scant investigation and lack of information
exchanged by authorities on the issue. 
<P>
   Arlacchi, who won fame for his efforts against the Mafia in
Italy, commented that the magnitude of international trafficking
in human beings approaches that of narcotics, but presents greater
difficulties for authorities attempting to fight it. 
<P>
   The Helsinki Foundation points to Brazil as the largest Latin
American source of women engaged in the sex trade in Europe, as
the country is responsible for 15 percent of the region's ''human
exports.'' 
<P>
   Brazil's Foreign Ministry has some idea of the problem's
gravity due to the number of Brazilian women deported back home,
especially from Spain. In 1998 alone, the Spanish authorities
returned 461 women of ''irregular legal status ''to Brazil,
according to consular information. 
<P>
   Portugal, Belgium, France and the Netherlands are other
countries where there are many Brazilian women forced into
prostitution. Brazil's border with Suriname is one of the major
routes for such trafficking in human beings, according to the
International Police (Interpol). 
<P>
   In Portugal, in addition to Brazilians, there are many
Colombian and Eastern European women in prostitution, according to
that country's Assistant Attorney General, Euclides Simaes. 
<P>
   The phenomenon of smuggling emigrant women is most evident in
countries facing war or prolonged economic crisis, which explains
the wave of women coming from countries such as Russia, Ukraine,
Hungary and Romania, pointed out Brazil's Human Rights Secretary
of State, ambassador Gilberto Saboia. 
<P>
   Brazil, he acknowledged, also faces intense internal
trafficking, as young people are forced into prostitution in
''remote areas of the country,'' such as the 'garimpo' zones of
informal gold mining, and along the nation's borders. There are
also reports of many Brazilian women sex workers in Paraguay. 
<P>
   Trafficking in children for illegal adoptions, and workers who
emigrate, fooled by intermediaries who offer nonexistent jobs,
were some of the other concerns addressed by the experts in
Brasilia. 
<P>
   In the case of smuggling children, Saboia stressed that The
Hague Convention, which regulates international adoption, must by
ratified in order to better combat illegal adoptions. 
<P>
   Justice Minister José Gregori signed an accord with Arlacchi
which establishes that the ODCCP is to assist the Brazilian
government in its fight against trafficking in women and children. 
<P>
   In mid-December, Brazil is also to sign the Convention against
Organised Crime, in Palermo, Italy, during an international
meeting to further define mechanisms to combat trafficking of
human beings.
