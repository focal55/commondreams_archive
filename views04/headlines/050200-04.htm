The air is crisp, the couple's footsteps purposeful in the snow. They have
the jaunty air of friends who have savored good times, endured the bad and
come through it bruised but wiser, resigned to what was lost between them,
content with what was found.<p>
   They are discussing the party to celebrate their divorce.<p>

	   "Have you thought about your toast?" Bert DeLeeuw, clad in jeans-jacket and
denim cap, asks his former wife.<p>
   "I have to make a toast?" Madeleine Adamson asks. She is cloaked in a long
wool coat with a cloche hat pulled low over her head.<p>
   "My problem is that I can't figure out how to keep my toast under 30
minutes," he says, chuckling.<p>
   "Oh, Bert," she sighs. "Please do."<p>
   "The end of an era," proclaimed the invitations. It was a spectacular end:
With the For Sale sign on the front lawn of their T Street house, DeLeeuw and
Adamson brought together friends and neighbors, former colleagues and former
lovers, set out food, beer and wine, uncorked champagne, hooked up Adamson's
tape machine to DeLeeuw's stereo and celebrated.<p>
   But what happened at this house was more than good times among friends. It
was a sanctuary for people with causes--social and political activists. People
like Madeleine Adamson and Bert DeLeeuw, who worked for the National Welfare
Rights Organization (NWRO) and later the Movement for Economic Justice.<p>
   It was a haven for visiting organizers--nearly as poor as the people they
organized--and friends who came for dinner and stayed into the night, drinking
wine and discussing organizing. Their friend and fellow organizer Tim Sampson
created the slogan "Robin Hood was Right"; and after a while, the T Street
house became known as The Robin Hood Hotel.<p>
   Their marriage has ended and so, at least for now, has their professional
relationship. But they are still activists, community organizers. In an age
when college students march off to study law and business, in a time when
sit-ins and demonstrations are relics remembered in faded newspaper
photographs, Adamson, 32, and DeLeeuw, 38, still do what most of the country
thinks has gone out of fashion.<p>
   They organized demonstrations and "actions" and arranged sit-ins at the
offices of state and federal officials. Adamson, as Washington representative
of ACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now),
spearheaded the organizing of the tent city on the Mall in the summer of 1982
to dramatize the housing crisis of the poor.<p>
   They lived frugally together, and when an organization that employed them
couldn't make its payroll, they went on unemployment. Adamson has never made
more than $8,000 a year, DeLeeuw only a little more than $12,000 a year. "I
used to always say that one of the things I wanted in life was to someday own
a sofa," she chuckled.<p>
   But life and work caught up with them. Adamson left ACORN to write a book
about the history of social protest in the United States. DeLeeuw, exhausted
after working for Barry Commoner's 1980 presidential campaign, became a
carpenter and runs his own business. "It's all honest work," he says. "The one
thing I didn't want to do, and don't ever want to do, is sell my soul for the
sake of doing something."<p>
   The house they bought at 17th and T streets NW nearly 10 years ago for
$29,500 is on the market for $175,000. They wince at this seemingly capitalist
venture. "The only way that we can sell it is for this outrageously inflated
market value," he explained, "because if we don't, we'll never be able to have
a house in the District of Columbia."<p>
   And for all their frustrations and annoyance with Washington, they have
stayed, drawn admittedly to the power center of the country, carrying on much
the same love-hate relationship with it that more conventional Washingtonians
do.<p>
   Their friends are still like them, they say. Ask about those who turned
into lawyers and businessmen and Adamson says flatly, "Don't know 'em."<p>
   "The Big Chill" disturbed her; DeLeeuw won't go to see it.<p>
   "It was just disturbing to see a popular film that portrayed these people
who started out activists and became conventional achievers," she says.<p>
   Now they are making longer breaks from Washington--DeLeeuw for a six-month
stay in Belize with his girlfriend; Adamson for a stay with her boyfriend, who
lives in Baltimore.<p>
   But they haven't forgotten the exhilaration they felt when they went to
jail for a cause. DeLeeuw was arrested so often (about 10 times) that his
Selective Service Board ruled him "morally unfit" for military service,
according to DeLeeuw.<p>
   "When you go to jail, it's such a clear, crisp definition of your belief in
the issue," he says quietly. "Civil disobedience is very powerful, because you
feel there's a higher law, a higher right . . . I think of all the times I've
been in jail as great times in my life. And I can't wait for another
opportunity to go to jail."<p>
   The fire for activism may have died on campuses and The Big Chill may have
spread. But not for Madeleine Adamson and Bert DeLeeuw and their close
friends. They are the keepers of the flame.<p>
   Their house is still a mix of the things they have collected: a thick wood
dining room table found in a basement, a softly ticking wall clock from a junk
store. art by friends. There are photographs of DeLeeuw and Adamson in
demonstrations and DeLeeuw with his T Street neighbors. There is a long
horizontal series of mirror artwork done by their friend Marie Ringwald, a
Washington artist.<p>
   On a shelf is a yellowed newspaper photograph of a 1970 sit-in in the
office of Health, Education and Welfare Secretary Robert Finch. In a room full
of welfare mothers and activists, they sit huddled by Finch's desk--DeLeeuw,
studious; Adamson, sober, madonnalike. George Wiley, the black professor of
chemistry turned leader of the welfare rights movement, sits in Finch's chair,
his feet triumphantly resting on the desk. They would all go to jail that day.<p>
   Books and records will be easily divided, but not that picture nor a button
collection (more than 100 on a swatch of burlap), which includes one from V-J
Day and a more contemporary "Vote Commoner." "I think it's going to be on
revolving custody," Adamson said solemnly.<p>
   Posing for pictures, they are a pleasant contrast. She is tall and thin
with long, straight, dark hair, and all edges: narrow direct eyes, high
cheekbones. He is shorter than she, with thick brown hair and mustache, wire
rim glasses. Where he is emotional and descriptive, she is spare and droll.
Where he is poignant, she is matter-of-fact. Particularly when they talk about
themselves.<p>
   The doorbell rang and Adamson returned with a package. "The moment of truth
has arrived," she announced.<p>
   "The buttons!" cried DeLeeuw. They tore off the wrappings to reveal a box
of buttons all proclaiming: "Robin Hood Hotel. The End of An Era. January 21,
1984."<p>
   They arrived by different paths.<p>
   DeLeeuw was raised a Calvinist in a conservative Bergen County, New Jersey,
Christian Reform church and grew up thinking he would be a minister. By his
second year at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., he had decided instead
that community organizing interested him. "That's what I got out of my
religious background: 'The least of those among you.' That was the notion of
what Christianity was supposed to be about--helping other people."<p>
   He majored in sociology, played tennis competitively and was briefly
married to his high school sweetheart. He graduated in 1967 and entered a
program in community organizing at the University of Michigan's School of
Social Work--a disappointment: "Their conception was organize a block to get a
park."<p>
   But things picked up.<p>
   "We all wanted to raise hell," said DeLeeuw. "There was just something
about the times, I guess. We wanted to go out and organize! We wanted to feel
that we were going to do something about the massive inequality in poor people
versus nonpoor people in society."<p>
   A group of them was attracted to the welfare rights movement just beginning
to gather steam at the time, devoted to helping mostly poor women and their
children get the payments they were entitled to by law. DeLeeuw arranged to
work in Washington the following summer, in 1968, for the National Welfare
Rights Organization on a grant. That was the summer of Resurrection City and
the Poor People's Campaign and poor people's marches, including one from the
Ellipse up Connecticut Avenue past the stores to the apartment building of
former House Ways and Means Committee chairman Wilbur Mills, a target of the
activists.<p>
   He got his master's in social work in 1969, and, beckoned by the headiness
of the summer before, returned to Washington to work with George Wiley.
DeLeeuw eventually became one of Wiley's top lieutenants and a good friend.<p>
   "I think I thought I was going to go into the Peace Corps," said Adamson
over dinner at a neighborhood restaurant. DeLeeuw sat at the table, listening.
"I had a teacher in high school who had been in the precursor of the Peace
Corps. She went to Africa. I thought she was the best thing since sliced
bread."<p>
   She grew up in Paramus, N.J., in a middle-class Catholic family, the
valedictorian of her 1969 high school graduating class.<p>
   "Someone told me, 'If you're interested in international relations, you
should go to Washington,' " she recalled. So she went to American University.
"I had some very naive and vague notion about helping people."<p>
   Once in school, she started going to marches. "It seemed to me that
everybody was doing it," she said, "and that's what campus organizing was--it
was all about ending the war. Somehow I decided that I wanted to do something
different . . . I was going to worry about what was happening at home."<p>
   She got out the phone book and searched under "national organizations"
until she came across the National Welfare Rights Organization. "I had no idea
what that was. I don't think I ever heard of it. But it sounded good."<p>
   She said she showed up in a skirt, looking like a member of the Junior
League. They put her to work on the folding machine. "I had to fold these
flyers all night long about school lunch stamps or something like that . . .
It was awful work. But I had already gotten in my head that it was what I
wanted to do, and welfare rights was real and it dealt with poor people and it
was doing exciting things. Even though I was running the folding machine."<p>
   She came in every day at 6 in the evening and stayed until 11.<p>
   DeLeeuw met her the first week. "She was okay," he said. Adamson laughed.<p>
   "She caught my eye," he said. "What can I say. I think I have really good
taste in women and she caught my eye . . ." She laughed louder.<p>
   "We just got to know each other," she said. "I don't think we had much time
to go out."<p>
   He rescued her from the folding machine.<p>
   "I put you on the great banner-making project," he reminded her.<p>
   "That was only a few months after I'd been there," said Adamson. "One day I
went in, and Bert said, 'We're going to make these banners.' They put out on
the floor these huge pieces of canvas and started painting these banners. I
don't know any more what they said."<p>
   " '$5,500 or Fight,' " DeLeeuw said, referring to the income level that
NWRO said, based on Labor Department statistics, a family of four ought to be
guaranteed.<p>
   "So we were painting these banners at night," she said. "Bert wouldn't tell
me why. It was this big secret. There was going to be this action."<p>
   DeLeeuw already was working on the action, "scoping out" the HEW building
and Finch's office before the sit-in. On the morning of May 13, 1970, Wiley
called Adamson: "He tells me, 'Do you want to come and get arrested this
morning? And can you bring some friends?' "<p>
   "He wouldn't tell you where or why," remembered DeLeeuw.<p>
   "It was exciting," Adamson said. "After running the mimeograph machine, to
get to go to jail was a lot more exciting."<p>
   "A big promotion," DeLeeuw said. They both laughed.<p>
   DeLeeuw and Adamson were married in December 1972, six months after Adamson
graduated from college. Her parents were not upset. After all they had worked
for McGovern and had come to Washington for antiwar demonstrations themselves.<p>
   "George Wiley had already left Welfare Rights," Adamson said. "I thought I
would go back to Washington and I would be part of the new venture the
Movement for Economic Justice . But there was some family pressure: 'If you're
going to go back to Washington and live with Bert you ought to get married.' "<p>
   And so they did--with a ceremony in the American University Chapel and a
big Chinese dinner afterward at Yenching Palace.<p>
   They made up buttons to pass out to guests. They read: Legalize Madeleine
and Bert.<p>
   Without really discussing it, they decided not to have children.<p>
   "I think in an implicit way, we both assumed children would interfere with
our work," Adamson said. "To me, now, it seems somewhat naive. I really
somehow had this optimistic view that I needed to be ready to be on the
barricades. Of course, it wasn't that way. I only got arrested once. I wasn't
out there fighting in the streets. But I had this feeling--and I think that
was very widespread among the community organizers--that you couldn't have
children and do the work. It wasn't part of the plan."<p>
   Eight months later, Wiley drowned in a boating accident.<p>
   "I didn't think Bert would recover," said Adamson. "Life without George was
so unimaginable. I remember being very worried about how we were going to
recover from it. We sort of threw ourselves into the organizing of the funeral
and the memorial service . . . We convinced Roberta Flack to sing at the
memorial service by telling her that George always listened to her records."<p>
   They carried on Wiley's fledgling Movement for Economic Justice (MEJ)--a
broad-based coalition of poor and middle-class people. DeLeeuw became director
and Adamson was director of research and publications. During that time she
created, edited and wrote a newsletter for community organizers called "Just
Economics." It kept community organizers abreast of actions around the
country.<p>
   In the fall of 1975, DeLeeuw, still searching for national impact, went to
work for presidential candidate Fred Harris. It was a shock to Adamson, who
had little interest in electoral politics, but DeLeeuw was intrigued: "He was
a good guy, but more importantly, the campaign offered an opportunity to
coalesce a national constituency of people ready to stand out on some
important issues."<p>
   Four months later, Harris was out of contention. "My batting average is not
too good on these political campaigns," said DeLeeuw, "but my conscience is
clear."<p>
   That year, the two closed down MEJ. They moved underground--into the
basement of their house--and continued to produce the newsletter for several
more years. The publication evolved into a journal called "The Organizer" and
still exists.<p>
   "People tend to shy away from conflict," said Adamson, sitting in her
apartment. She has neatly arranged a large desk, a bed and a small round
dining room table into the space. In one area of the wall are old photographs
of grandparents. Pussywillows in a vase are still festooned with Christmas
ornaments.<p>
   "I not only believe that conflict gets more results, it's also a lot more
exhilarating."<p>
   Adamson went to work for ACORN in 1978, and in 1979, DeLeeuw became
director of the Citizens Party. By the time he came back from the Commoner
campaign, exhausted from traveling with the candidate, their marriage was
foundering.<p>
   They keep the details of why it broke up to themselves. However, they both
admit they put their time together into the professional relationship, not
their personal relationship.<p>
   "We worked together, we lived together, at a certain point we did both
things in the same place--our house," said Adamson. "For a while I thought
that was ideal--there's a lot of pressure in the work and it's important if
you're involved in a relationship with someone that they understand why that
is. But at a certain point, it was too insulated."<p>
   Also, DeLeeuw was more the public figure. "I was always the one who kept
the home fires burning workwise," she said. "I would get things done but very
much behind the scenes. I didn't resent that--living in Bert's shadow. But it
was a little frustrating. I was interested in creating a little independence
in my professional life--not having people always say 'Bert and Madeleine.'
Maybe have someone say, 'Madeleine and Bert.' "<p>
   DeLeeuw acknowledges that this was a problem. ". . . everyone who's ever
been associated with us knows that Madeleine is probably the stronger of the
two, the more important . . . I always did as much as I could to recognize and
give her top billing. But it's difficult to do that when you're married to
someone. People mistrust your motives."<p>
   Above all, their relationship became too narrow. "We both ended up with
lovers who are artists," DeLeeuw said. "We were interested in broadening the
kinds of things you deal with in your personal life."<p>
   Still, something remains.<p>
   "What's significant," he said, "is that we've ended up as best friends
which is--"<p>
   "--an accomplishment," she finished.<p>
   "Everyone should be so lucky," he said.<p>
   "I would regret it if we were not close and I would hate to see the day
when we weren't," she said.<p>
   They gathered to celebrate the end of an era, friends from organizing days,
friends from school days: Rafe Pomerance, president of Friends of the Earth
and best man at their wedding; Marie Ringwald and Michael Kerr, the two who
met through DeLeeuw and Adamson and were married in the T Street house. There
was Adamson's college roommate, Arlene Gottlieb, and former welfare rights
organizers from all over the country who now live in Washington. There was
DeLeeuw's T Street neighbor, Emma Crudup, who has lived on the block 40 years.<p>
   Adamson's boyfriend, John Beam, a musician and an artist, watched the group
good-naturedly. "This is interesting for me," said Beam, 39, who wears his
long brown hair in a ponytail. He met Adamson when he did an illustration job
for ACORN in 1979. "I was a goner," he said. "I was here," he grinned,
"putting the hex on Bert."<p>
   DeLeeuw's girlfriend, Lina Newhouser, 32, listened to the tales and
anecdotes and took pictures. "Sure, it's weird," she said. "I'm not part of
this whole past."<p>
   Talk turned to the series of May Day demonstrations in 1971. "We all got
gassed . . ." said Michael Kerr, grinning.<p>
   "I got arrested on the Capitol steps," said Gottlieb. "The only way
Madeleine found out where I was was when she opened The Washington Post and
saw me . . ."<p>
   Seth Borgos, an ACORN organizer who left to write the book with Adamson on
social protest, worked first in Arkansas, the home of ACORN. "Madeleine and
Bert were awesome figures," he said. He remembers passing through town and the
house. There he would get not just a place to sleep and good food but war
stories and a sense of the history of the movement.<p>
   "I don't feel the same way about people going to law school or business
school that Madeleine and Bert probably would," he mused. "I don't see it as
selling out. I see it as a failure of imagination. A lot of people who went to
law school or business school did it because they couldn't think of anything
else to do."<p>
   DeLeeuw and Adamson glided among their guests. Adamson had shed her
"uniform" of corduroys and sweater for a dress she had bought for the
occasion. DeLeeuw was wearing his jeans but added a tie from his unusual
collection.<p>
   "Buttons?" asked one surprised guest as Adamson handed her a Robin Hood
Hotel button.<p>
   "Every action needs a button," said Adamson succinctly.<p>
   They opened the champagne at 9:30 and guests gathered for the toasts. The
living room was all soft light and golden wood floors, with ferns hanging
gracefully over the mantel.<p>
   They filled their glasses and waited for DeLeeuw to start:<p>
   "Living stripped of all of its facets . . . reduces down to relationships,"
he began. "That's why this house has been so important to me. We've had
parties, we've had meetings, we've had block associations."<p>
   He was warming to his subject. "I am a socialist," he pronounced. "It's
because society is based on collectivity and interpersonal relationships that
capitalism will fail."<p>
   "Aw-right!" cried Adamson.<p>
   "Bert comes out of the closet after all these years," observed one guest
with a chuckle.<p>
   "That's why I love this block," he said. "We've shared, there's a sense of
collective responsibility and caring for each other . . ."<p>
   He spoke of his former wife:<p>
   "Some years ago, I inflicted much hurt in the relationship I had with
Madeleine Adamson," he said, "and subsequently I wasn't willing to spend time
to repair that hurt. And Madeleine's response . . . was not to use force or
bring in a pile of lawyers but instead seize on what was good in that
relationship and build a new relationship for us, though lovers we no longer
are . . ."<p>
   There is a little tremor in his voice. "And I learned more from how
Madeleine handled that crisis in our life than anything else and I raise this
glass to you and to Madeleine," he said, his voice quivering. "This is not
ending tonight with any of you."<p>
   Adamson, as planned, had the closing words:<p>
   "We got married. We had to sign some papers. It didn't change anything,"
she said nonchalantly. "And then we got divorced. We signed some papers. It
didn't change anything. We still love each other--in our own way."<p>
   They all raised their glasses to toast.
