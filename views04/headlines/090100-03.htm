WASHINGTON  - President Clinton will announce on
Friday that he will leave a decision on whether to deploy a
national missile defense to his successor, U.S. officials said.
<p>Clinton, who leaves office on Jan. 20, will say in a speech
at Georgetown University that he has decided against taking
steps to begin building an anti-missile radar in Alaska, which
would be the first step in deploying a missile shield, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
<p>At issue is the proposed $60 billion construction of a
high-technology shield against ballistic missiles, which is
designed to be operational by 2005 to protect against the
possibility of missile attacks from states like North Korea,
Iran and Iraq.
<p>Clinton's decision effectively delays the 2005 deployment
date because, to meet the schedule laid out by the Pentagon,
the first contracts for the radar would have to be awarded by
December to allow building to begin next spring.
<p>His action leaves a missile defense system to be debated on
the campaign trail between Vice President Al Gore , the Democrat
who has backed Clinton's decisions on it, and Republican George
W. Bush, who wants to deploy a larger system than contemplated
by Clinton as soon as possible.
<p>Russia and China bitterly oppose a U.S. missile defense.
Moscow has refused to agree to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty and has said it would stop nuclear arms cuts
under other treaties if Washington broke the ABM accord.
<p>A U.S. official said Clinton made his decision after
thoroughly reviewing recommendations from his senior advisers,
including Defense Secretary William Cohen, and took into
account threat, cost, technical feasibility and overall impact
on national security, including arms control.
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="2">Missile Defense Not Dead</font></b></font>
<p>The decision to delay putting out contracts for a radar
station on Alaska's remote Shemy Island does not mean a missile
defense is dead, another official said.
<p>``That doesn't mean we're not going forward. There's going
to be further testing. But it's not beginning (now),'' the
official said.
<p>John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World
and a well-respected arms control expert, said the decision by
Clinton was ``a triumph of prudence over politics.''
<p>Following spectacular test failures and delays with
components of the system, including a booster rocket firing the
interceptor into space, he said: ``It is now clear that the 2005
deadline will slip a couple of years.''
<p>``This technology would not be ready for prime time,'' he
added.
<p>Clinton, who had earlier been cool to the project, signed
Republican-initiated legislation last year making it U.S.
policy to deploy a national missile defense when it was
technically feasible.
<p>In the final days before his decision, sharp differences
had emerged among top officials over how far initial work could
go on a missile defense system before violating a 1972 arms
treaty with Russia.
<p>Clinton said last year he would announce this summer
whether he was going ahead with a plan to deploy a system
including 100 interceptors based in Alaska linked with a
complex land and space-based radar detection system.
<p>But a series of test failures as well as an inability to
persuade Russia to accept changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty and opposition from NATO allies have cast doubt
on the project.
<p>A $100 million test in July failed when a warhead failed to
separate from its booster rocket and intercept a dummy warhead
over the Pacific Ocean.
<p>A previous U.S. test was successful in October 1999, but a
subsequent second test in January failed.
<p>There have been growing calls in Congress and from national
security specialists in Washington for Clinton to delay making
a decision on deploying the controversial system until it had
been more thoroughly tested.
<p>In July, Defense Secretary Cohen confirmed that Clinton has
backed off his commitment last year to make a decision on NMD
deployment and would simply decide whether to keep the
timetable open for possible deployment by 2005.
