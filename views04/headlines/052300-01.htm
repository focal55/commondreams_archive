PRISTINA, Kosovo, May 22 -- One 
boy was killed and two other children 
were seriously wounded by a cluster 
bomb on Sunday, and a United Nations official said today that NATO 
had delayed the marking and removal of its unexploded bombs.

<p>  Since refugees returned to Kosovo 
in June, more than 100 people have 
died in mine and bomb accidents, 
and hundreds have been wounded. 
 An estimated 40 percent have been 
the victims of cluster bombs.

<p>  One cluster bomb releases up to 
200 bomblets that scatter over a wide 
area and should explode on impact. 
But explosives experts have found 
that there is a high failure rate, as 
high as 20 percent in some areas, and 
the bombs lie on the surface or often 
dig into the earth. Children and farmers often find the bright-colored, 
shuttlecock-shaped bombs.

<p> NATO did not provide detailed information on the airstrikes that 
dropped 1,392 cluster bombs on Kosovo until two weeks ago, nearly a year 
after the conflict ended, said John 
Flanagan, program manager of the 
United Nations Mine Action Coordination Center. It coordinates civilian 
organizations clearing mines and unexploded ordinance across Kosovo.

<p>  "It was definitely frustrating," 
Mr. Flanagan said. "Ten months after the conflict finished, we are just 
getting to grips with the information, 
and it shouldn't be like that." 

<p>   Teams that search for unexploded 
mines have been able to mark only 60 
to 70 percent of the cluster bomb 
sites so far. That much  could have 
been accomplished earlier if the 
teams had  the information on the 
airstrikes, he said. 

<p>  The NATO-led peacekeeping force 
in Kosovo has also failed to meet its 
commitments to survey and mark 
the bombed areas, he said. "It became clear that we did not have all 
the information, and the marking 
was not done," Mr. Flanagan said. 
"Sometimes the first we knew of a 
strike area was when there was a 
casualty."  

<p>  Another sore topic has been whether depleted-uranium munitions were 
used in the air campaign in Kosovo. 
NATO finally admitted in February 
that such munitions were used.  Last 
week the United Nations secretary 
general, Kofi Annan, wrote to the 
NATO secretary general, George 
Robertson, asking for detailed maps 
showing where those strikes were 
made in Kosovo.   
<p>           

<p>  Mr. Annan asked for precise areas 
of the strikes and for assistance to 
undertake "systematic radiation 
measurements and sampling." He 
also asked for help in preventing 
damage from the munitions. 

<p>  While there is some debate about 
the danger of depleted-uranium debris, there is no doubt about the 
danger of cluster bombs, which has 
shocked both peacekeeping soldiers 
and civilians  working to render the 
mines harmless. "Cluster bombs almost always cause multiple casualties, and it is nearly always young 
people who get injured," Mr. Flanagan said. "We did not anticipate the 
number of them used and their attractiveness to kids."  

<p>  Refugees in the camps were not 
warned of the dangers of cluster 
bombs, he added, and even soldiers 
under the NATO command were not 
always well-informed.   In the 10 1/2  
months before April this year, there 
were 478 casualties in Kosovo from 
mines or bombs, and 100 of them 
were fatalities, Mr. Flanagan said. 
With the arrival of spring, the casualty figure has climbed again, to 15 
casualties in April. Four  teams are 
concentrating on clearing cluster 
bombs and hope to clear  the 333 
known sites of  bomblets this year.

<p>  But the bomblets from a single 
bomb can scatter over a large area.   
When he applied directly to the United States military, Mr. Flanagan 
said, he finally received vital details 
like the direction of attack of the 
plane and wind conditions.   
<p>

<p>  He blames the structure of NATO 
and of the peacekeeping force as 
much as anything for the delay and 
lack of help.   Under their mandate, 
peacekeepers have restricted themselves to clearance they judged essential to their mission, and they 
have left the mine clearance to civilian teams financed by the United 
Nations. 

<p>  "A lot of work was done, and then 
there was a line drawn in the sand," 
Mr. Flanagan said, alluding to the 
fact that many military explosives 
experts were pulled out, even while 
cluster bomb sites remained unmapped and uncleared. "They could 
have made a significant dent in the 
situation."
