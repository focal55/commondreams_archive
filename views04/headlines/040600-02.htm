A scientific panel that waded into the debate over 
genetically engineered foods yesterday drew fire from environmental 
opponents for taking a narrow, pro-industry view of the possible 
human and environmental risks posed by gene-splicing technology.	 
<P>  In a 261-page report issued yesterday, a 12-person National 
Research Council panel said it ``was not aware of any evidence 
suggesting foods on the market today are unsafe to eat as a result of 
genetic modification.''	 
</P>
<P>  Genetic engineering involves the transfer in a laboratory of genes 
from one plant or animal into a crop. Traditional plant breeding 
tries to introduce new genes through pollen transfer, or sexual 
reproduction, from one plant to another.	 
</P>
<P>  The panelists, who spent a year hammering out a consensus report, 
said the Environmental Protection Agency should revise, and then 
implement, a genetic plant review process that it proposed in 1994 
but has not completed.	 
</P>
<P>   The suggested revision involves EPA's proposed exemption of plant 
breeders who use sexual reproduction to introduce alien genes into a 
crop. The panel questioned why the review process focused solely on 
gene-splicing.	 
</P>
<P>  The panel also said the EPA needed to work more closely with the 
Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, two 
other agencies involved in the review process, to improve safety 
testing and alleviate concerns that genetically modified foods might 
pose health or environmental risks.	 
</P>
<P>  The scientists acknowledged that their report focused on only gene 
modifications that make plants resistant to pests and diseases. It 
did not study other common types of alterations, such as adding genes 
to make plants herbicide-resistant or to improve their vitamin 
content.	 
</P>
<P>  Nor did the report discuss whether genetically modified foods 
should be labeled, a move opponents have demanded to alert people who 
may be afraid of allergic reactions to new genes or who simply do not 
like the technology.	 
</P>
<P>  Even before the report was issued, environmentalists complained 
that the committee was stacked to favor agribusiness. The committee's 
original staff director, for example, is now a lobbyist for the 
Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington, D.C.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Given the conflicts of this study, this is not credible as an 
independent scientific report,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal 
director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, D.C. His group 
has filed federal lawsuits challenging the FDA and other regulatory 
agencies.	 
</P>
<P>   Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., 
co-authors of bills to force the labeling of genetically modified 
foods, also accused the panel of pro-industry ``bias.''	 
</P>
<P>   At the news conference where the report was released, panel 
Chairman Perry Adkisson, an entomologist and chancellor emeritus at 
Texas A&M University, stressed that the report reflects a consensus 
view that included the opinions of Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with 
Environmental Defense in New York.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Given the extraordinarily strong feelings on all sides . . . it's 
not surprising that our work has come under such strong scrutiny,'' 
he said.	 
</P>
<P>  But while Goldburg acknowledged that ``the committee members 
worked hard to get out a consensus recommendation,'' she declined to 
give the report a ringing endorsement.	 
</P>
<P> ``People should look at the criticisms and look at the report and 
draw their own conclusions,'' she said.	 
</P>
<P>  The report is available at <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu">www.nas.edu</A>.
