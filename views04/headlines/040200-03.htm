FLORHAM PARK, N.J., April 1 -- The police brought out 
mounted patrols,  dogs and metal 
barricades  today to  prepare for a 
protest against the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund  by 
many of the same people who led 
destructive demonstrations last year 
at the World Trade Organization 
meetings in Seattle.

<p>  Billed in a news release as  "picking up where Seattle left off," the 
rally outside a World Bank and 
I.M.F. conference here was expected 
to draw several hundred protesters, 
said organizers of the New Jersey/New York Mobilization for Global Justice.

<p>  They said the rally was  a tuneup 
for a  demonstration  at meetings of 
the two economic groups on April 16 
and 17  in Washington, D.C.

<p>  Organizers said they did not plan 
to disrupt the weekend meetings 
sponsored by the two groups and the 
Brookings Institution.

<p>  The protesters planned to rally at 
a barricaded parking lot next to the 
Hamilton Park Conference Center.

<p>  But two women who were part of 
the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in December were 
arrested on Thursday after they  unfurled a 40-foot banner from the top 
of the  center, the police said.

<p>  The women, Lisa Kuhn, 19, of Salt 
Lake City and Judith Karpova, 54, of 
Hoboken, were charged with criminal trespassing, criminal mischief 
and possession of burglary tools, the 
authorities said. The two used bolt 
cutters to cut the chain on a trap door 
to the roof of the hotel before unfurling the banner,  which read "World 
Bank and IMF = Corporate Colonialism," the authorities said.

<p>  A rally organizer, Ted Glick, said 
the coalition did not advocate violence or civil disobedience, but "a 
number of us thought that was a nice 
action."

<p>  "Ultimately, we can't stop them," 
he said of groups who may decide to 
protest more forcefully.

<p>  The coalition blames the W.T.O., 
the World Bank and the I.M.F. for 
globalization of the world economy. 
The protesters  believe that the World 
Bank and the I.M.F., charged with 
using international corporations to 
improve life in developing countries, 
instead throw the countries into debt 
while enriching corporations and degrading the environment.

<p>  About 100 people attending the 
conference are meeting to discuss 
the collapse of economies in Asia and 
its effect on developing countries. A 
World Bank spokesman, Andrew 
Kircher, said the bank had noticed a 
rising level of awareness of the meetings in the United States, especially 
since the Seattle protests.

<p>  More than 100 officers, some with 
horses and dogs, have been patrolling the conference center here since 
the conference began on Thursday, 
said Steven Foley, a spokesman for 
the Morris County prosecutor's office. The police put up barricades 
and first aid tents and videotaped 
protesters from a hotel window.

<p>  Mr. Foley described the police 
presence as precautionary, a reaction to the violence and destruction 
that paralyzed the Seattle sessions of 
the World Trade Organization. Those 
protests led to $2.5 million in damage, a state of emergency in the city 
and the arrests of 500 protesters.

<p>  Four protesters slept by the side of 
the road here on Thursday night, 
surrounded by signs with messages 
like "Break the Boomerang of 
Debt," and "Honk for Global Justice."

<p>  On Friday, mounted police officers 
and officials standing on the hotel 
roof with binoculars outnumbered 
the 20 or so protesters who marched 
from a teach-in on Drew University's 
campus about a mile away.
