A prominent antimissile critic has 
found what he says is a major flaw  in 
the Pentagon's antimissile plan and 
is calling on the White House to appoint a high-level scientific panel to 
investigate what he says were fraudulent efforts to cover it up.

<p>  If the critic is correct, the flaw 
 may cripple or even kill the proposed 
weapon system, the cost of which is 
estimated at up to $60 billion. 

<p>      The critic is Theodore A. Postol, 
professor of science and national security studies at M.I.T., author of 
many reports on antimissile systems 
and in the 1980's a science adviser to 
the chief of naval operations on ballistic missile technologies and potential weapons against them. He made 
his new accusations in a May 11 
letter to John D. Podesta, the White 
House chief of staff, after reviewing 
Pentagon data gathered by an antimissile whistle-blower.

<p> Dr. Postol's critique centers on the 
hardest part of the missile defense 
challenge, distinguishing incoming 
weapons from decoys and destroying 
them.

<p>      In the letter, a copy of which he 
gave to The New York Times, Dr. 
Postol said Pentagon sensor data he 
had obtained from the first antimissile test flight in June 1997 showed 
that the ground-based interceptor 
was inherently unable to make the 
distinction  and that the Pentagon 
and its contractors had tried to hide 
this failure.

<p>      The coverup, he said,  was "like 
rolling a pair of dice and throwing 
away all outcomes that did not give 
snake eyes."

<p>     An inability to tell cheap decoys 
from costly warheads in theory could 
force a defender to fire interceptors 
at every threatening object, which as 
a practical matter could make the 
system useless.

<p>      P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the 
National Security Council, said the 
White House was carefully weighing 
Dr. Postol's appeal but was unlikely 
to move quickly.

<p>      "It's premature to say this merits 
an outside review," Mr. Crowley 
said. "We have to let the Department 
of Defense complete its deployment 
readiness review," which starts in 
late June and  lasts a month.

<p>      A senior federal official, who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity, said 
that if a scheduled antimissile flight 
test failed, that would tend to bolster 
 concerns about the system and probably help prompt an independent investigation.

<p>      Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air 
Force, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, said   a detailed written 
response was being prepared for Dr. 
Postol and the White House.

<p>         "We take allegations of fraud very 
seriously," Colonel Lehner said. "We 
have looked at many of these allegations in the past, and have found 
nothing which supports either the 
scientific criticisms or any fraud."

<p>      But Richard L. Garwin, a top federal science adviser who has expressed doubts about some aspects 
of the missile defense idea, said he 
had seen Dr. Postol's letter and considered his technical points "very 
important."

<p> In a recent New York Times/CBS 
poll, 58 percent of the respondents 
said they favored trying to build an 
antimissile defense. But that figure 
dropped to 25 percent, the poll found, 
when respondents were asked what 
their opinion would be "if many scientists conclude it is unlikely that 
such a system will ever work."

<p>      Testing of the would-be antimissile 
weapon has not gone smoothly. The 
first two flight experiments simply 
gathered sensor data on mock warheads and decoys. The most elaborate of these, in June 1997, is the 
subject of Dr. Postol's attack.

<p>      Last October, the Pentagon hailed 
the first intercept try as a success 
but later conceded that the interceptor  had initially drifted off course 
and picked out the decoy balloon 
rather than the warhead. In a January test, a sensor coolant leak caused 
the interceptor to miss the target. 

<p>      A third intercept test is set for late 
June.   
<p>President Clinton is expected 
to decide afterward whether the 
United States should build a limited 
defense against missile attacks by 
rogue countries.

<p>      To date, targets in the interception 
tests have consisted of a single mock 
warhead and a single decoy balloon. 
The Pentagon says it plans to increase decoy complexity in future 
tests. 

<p>      In his letter to the White House, Dr. 
Postol said the Pentagon's analysis 
of the more elaborate June 1997 sensor test  "urgently needs to be investigated by a team of scientists who 
are recognized for their scientific 
accomplishments and independence 
from the Pentagon." His three-page 
letter had four detailed attachments 
meant to back up his claims. 

<p>      His charges are based partly on an 
antimissile criticism by Nira 
Schwartz, a former senior engineer 
at TRW, a top military contractor. In 
a suit against TRW, Dr. Schwartz 
has accused the company of faking 
antimissile tests and evaluations of 
computer programs for the interceptor's sensor and then firing her when 
she protested. Through her litigation 
and a Pentagon inquiry,  Dr. 
Schwartz obtained many antimissile 
reports and data, some of which she 
has shared with Dr. Postol.

<p>      A nuclear engineer by training, Dr. 
Postol in his analysis of the Pentagon 
reports goes beyond questions of 
computer analysis of data from incoming targets. In fact, he said, the 
test showed that warheads and decoys appear so similar that sensors 
might never be able to tell them 
apart.   
<p>He also says the Pentagon 
conspired to cover up this sensor 
problem.

<p>      The brightness readings from the 
mock warhead and decoys, he told 
the White House, "fluctuated in a 
varied and totally unpredictable 
way," revealing no feature "that 
could be used to distinguish one object from the other."

<p>      Faced with this upset, Dr. Postal 
continued, the analytical team arbitrarily rejected and selected data to 
create an "elaborate hoax" that was 
then hidden in reports by the use of 
"misleading, confusing, and self-contradictory language."
