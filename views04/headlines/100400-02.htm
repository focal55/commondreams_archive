WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (IPS) - Toxic pollution that has mysteriously
entered
Canada's pristine Arctic region has now been linked to air
emissions from
specific municipal waste incinerators, cement kilns and industrial
plants in
the United States, Canada and Mexico, according to a new study
released Tuesday. 
<P>
Although there are few pollution sources in Nunavut, the region of
Arctic
Canada studied, it is on the receiving end of toxic pollutants
known  as dioxin
that have been transported over long distances by the prevailing
air  currents,
says the report by the Center for Biology of Natural Systems of
Queens College
in New York. 
<P>
''Decision makers now have the ability to determine where dioxin
is coming
from
and where it is going,'' says Greg Block with the North American
Commission
for
Environmental Co-operation, a Montreal-based inter-governmental
organisation
set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
<P>
''This will be very helpful in prioritising cost-effective efforts
to  reduce
exposure,'' he says.  
<P>
Block's organisation commissioned the report.  
<P>
Dioxin are one of a dozen types of chemicals known as Persistent
Organic
Pollutants or POPs, which accumulate in the fat of animals.  
<P>
Dioxin, proven to cause cancer, immune deficiency and harmful
reproductive and
developmental effects, are unintentionally produced as by-products
of
incineration and industrial processes. 
<P>
According to scientists, POPs are capable of being transported
long distances
through the environment and end up settling in colder regions
because  of
weather patterns. 
<P>
The study released Tuesday was a response to numerous scientific
reports that
revealed high amounts of dioxin in the food chain in the polar
regions and
blood supply of indigenous people living in the Arctic, known as
the  Inuit. 
<P>
In Nunavut, for example, even thought there are no significant
sources of
dioxin within 500 kilometres, dioxin concentrations in Inuit
mothers  breast
milk are twice the levels observed in southern Quebec. 
<P>
Now for the first time, this study reveals where exactly the
dioxin
originated.
The authors of the study hope this will aid international and
regional efforts
to reduce dioxin at the source so that it never ends up in the
food chain. 
<P>
''The only possible way of dealing with the issue is going to the
source and
preventing or reducing the amount of dioxin that comes out of that
source,''
says Barry Commoner, a scientist at Queens College who headed the
research
study. 
<P>
Using mathematical and meteorological models, the study analyses
1996-1997
data
obtained by Canadian, Mexican and US environmental regulatory
agencies. 
<P>
The model estimated the amount of dioxin emitted by each source in
the three
countries at its geographical location. Using weather and climate
data, the
model then predicted which dioxin would reach various locations in
Nunavut. 
<P>
Overall the greatest contribution, about 70 to 82 percent, of
dioxin  in
Nunavut
is coming from US sources. 
<P>
About two-thirds of the total dioxin emission is caused by
municipal  waste
incinerators, medical waste incinerators, cement kilns burning
hazardous waste
and backyard trash burning. Iron sintering, and copper and
aluminum smelting,
are other major sources of dioxin, according to the report. 
<P>
While the contamination problem can seem overwhelming, the
realistic
possibility of adequately stopping the pollution at specific
sources  is
strengthened by the study's finding that most of the airborne
dioxin deposited
in Nunavut originates from an extremely small number of individual
sources. 
<P>
Six of the total North American sources identified as emitting the
most
dioxin,
for example, are located in the industrialised eastern half of the
United
States. These include three municipal waste incinerators, two iron
sintering
plants and one copper smelter. 
<P>
Canadian sources contribute between 11 and 25 percent of dioxin
reaching
Nunavut, while Mexican sources contribute about five to 11
percent. The
largest
amount of dioxin emitted by a single Canadian source was a
municipal  waste
incinerator in Quebec. 
<P>
No single Mexican source is ranked in the top 35 percent of sites
listed. 
<P>
Since the model used in the study relies on data from 1996 and
1997,  the
current amount of dioxin coming from the reported sources are
likely  to be
much
different because of recent pollution regulations, says Block. 
<P>
''The snapshot could look different today since 1997 air quality
regulations
have come into place,'' he says. 
<P>
Michael McCally, an expert on dioxin who teaches at New York's
Mount Sinai
School of Medicine called the report ''tremendously significant''. 
<P>
''We have known for a long time that native communities living in
the  Arctic
circle thousands of miles from industry had high levels of dioxin
in  their
blood and tissue samples and now we have specified where the
dioxin is
actually
coming from,'' he told IPS in a phone interview. 
<P>
Indigenous leaders are praising the researchers for finally
pinpointing the
exact location of pollution sources that they said have
contaminated  their
communities for decades. 
<P>
''For us, this particular study is very important,'' says Sheila
Watt
Cloutier,
an Inuit leader in Canada. 
<P>
Tens of thousands of Inuit people living in Nunavut territory
depend  on
Caribou 
for food. Past studies have found that Caribou herds in the region  
are 
contaminated by dioxin. 
<P>
''Human exposure to dioxin is almost entirely (98 percent) through  
animal 
foods, especially those that are rich in fat,'' according to the  
report 
released today. 
<P>
In Washington on Tuesday afternoon, indigenous leaders throughout  
North 
America 
held a press conference in front of the US State Department. They  
called for 
lawmakers to take tougher national and international action on  
eliminating 
Persistent Organic Pollutants at the source. 
<P>
''From the Great Lake tribes to the Native villages of Alaska,  
dioxin , DDT, 
PCB 
and other chemicals are in the bodies of our traditional food web -  
from the 
fish we eat - to the bodies of our people,'' says Tom Goldtooth,  
director of 
the Indigenous Environmental Network, an advocacy group based in  
the  state of 
Minnesota. 
<P>
In December in Johannesburg, South Africa, nations will begin the  
fin al 
negotiating session of an international treaty that seeks to  
eliminate POPs. 
Environmentalists and indigenous groups alike have accused the  
United 
States of 
trying to weaken the treaty. 
<P>
Shawn Larson, who works with Alaska Community Action on Toxics, a  
Native 
American advocacy group, says her village is very concerned about  
the  health 
effects - like cancer, diabetes and learning disabilities that she  
says POPs 
are causing. 
<P>
''I have come here on behalf of my people to ask that the United  
States 
government owns up to its responsibility to protect us as a  
people,''  she told 
reporters on Tuesday.
