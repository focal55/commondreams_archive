The 
Clinton administration is opposing a 
World Bank proposal that would increase exports from the world's 
poorest and most indebted nations 
for fear that it would inflame sentiments in Congress against President 
Clinton's efforts to win passage of an 
African trade bill and give China 
permanent normal trading status. 

<p> The proposal, pressed by the leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in preparation for their meetings here next 
week, would allow some of the poorest nations of Africa, Latin America 
and Asia to sell  goods to the United 
States and other Western nations 
without facing any tariffs or import 
quotas. That could provide a huge 
economic advantage for those developing countries, going significantly 
beyond the administration's efforts 
to get Congress to forgive their debts 
as they undergo economic reforms. 
<p>The administration's opposition to 
the proposal comes at an awkward 
moment, as demonstrators critical 
of the international lending institutions assemble for a week of protests 
during their meetings. Many of the 
protesters believe that the financial 
groups do too little on behalf of the 
poorest nations.
<p>    But as the trade proposal was argued out behind the closed doors of 
the World Bank and the I.M.F., the 
administration worked behind the 
scenes to scuttle it, said World Bank 
officials involved in the negotiations. 
Those officials said they believed 
that the White House feared that if 
they made such a commitment, it 
would undercut the delicate support 
for the Africa trade bill, which has 
been stuck in Congress, and that any 
promise of further opening America's markets could undermine the 
huge effort to persuade Congress to 
normalize trade with China.

<p>  "We are really caught in the middle here," one senior administration 
official said on Friday, explaining 
why the White House had refused to 
endorse a plan that would aid some 
of the most struggling nations, including Senegal, Nicaragua, Congo, 
Kenya, Honduras and Nigeria, which 
pose little competitive threat to 
American firms.

<p>  "The best way to lift nations out of 
poverty is through trade," the administration official said. "But doing 
the right thing here is not easy. We 
can't even get far more modest 
measures through the Hill."

<p> Charlene Barshefsky, the United 
States trade representative, said she 
had been unaware of the efforts to 
water down the World Bank effort. 
But she said that "the United States 
has a long record of support for and 
delivery of preferential trade privileges for least-developed countries." 

<p> She said that the United States, 
 working with Europe, Japan and 
Canada, has proposed an initiative 
 within the World Trade Organization 
that would take much the same approach as the principles set out by 
the World Bank.   
<p>

<p> Such a program, however, would 
likely be narrower in scope and be 
enacted only after Congress votes on 
the Africa and China issues.

<p> The administration's quandary underscores the enormous economic 
tensions that will be on display in 
Washington in coming days. Poor 
nations will argue, as they did during 
the Seattle trade meetings three 
months ago, that the United States 
and other rich nations are using their 
enormous prosperity and technology 
to grow rapidly at the expense of 
countries being left far behind by 
economic globalization. 

<p> That view is essentially endorsed 
in several reports prepared for the 
spring meetings of the World Bank, 
which fights poverty, and the I.M.F., 
which intercedes in economic crises.

<p> During his radio address today, 
President Clinton briefly mentioned 
his hope that Congress would agree 
to gradually wipe away the debt of 
the poorest nations. 

<p> But in Congress, where labor 
unions and others have argued 
against further opening of American 
markets at a time of record trade 
deficits, there is enormous resistance to removing tariffs or quotas 
that protect American industries 
from low-cost manufacturing 
abroad. 

<p> For example, the Africa trade bill, 
which passed the Senate last November but never passed the House, now 
includes requirements that African 
nations  hoping to export more clothing to the United States duty free buy 
American fabrics. Few of the countries could afford to do so, making 
the market opening relatively worthless to African weavers or small 
manufacturers. (Africa's trade with 
the United States is comparatively 
small. The entire continent, excluding South Africa, exports about $13 
billion in goods to the United States 
each year, slightly more than  Japan 
exports here in a month.)

<p> But without such trade restrictions, members of Congress from 
textile-producing states say they 
would have to vote against the Africa 
bill. And the World Bank and I.M.F. 
proposals would have essentially undercut the bill's protections for 
American companies, committing 
the United States, Europe and Japan 
to unrestricted import of clothing, 
footwear or other goods from the 
most indebted nations.

<p> Administration officials said that 
any such end run around Congress 
would inflame many members, especially Democrats, thus threatening 
the passage of the Africa bill and 
China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization, two main elements of 
Mr. Clinton's agenda for his last year 
in office. 

<p> Documents being prepared for discussion at next week's Washington 
meetings are implicitly critical of 
how little the world's wealthy nations 
have done to keep the divide between 
rich and poor from increasing.

<p> A draft of one such paper, provided 
to The New York Times by the World 
Bank, notes that during the Seattle 
meetings, the head of the bank, 
James D. Wolfensohn, and the recently retired head of the I.M.F., 
Michel Camdessus, called on major 
nations to spur imports from the 
poorest nations. The paper describes 
the strategy as a way to reverse the 
declining trend in foreign aid flows to 
these countries.

<p>The paper refers to the critical 
importance of matching debt relief 
with efforts to encourage exports 
that earn hard currency.

<p>But diplomats involved in the 
drafting of the reports say that the 
wording was toned down at the insistence of the United States and, to a 
lesser degree, France and Japan. 
They all have a huge sensitivity to 
opening their markets, particularly 
for agricultural goods, and particularly in election years, one senior 
World Bank official said. Instead of 
strongly recommending market 
openings, the report now simply 
notes that ministers may wish to 
comment on the subject.
