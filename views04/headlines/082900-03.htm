UNITED NATIONS  - Heads of state, religious leaders
and civil society will meet in New York within the next two weeks
in a forum designed to air concerns and devise strategies to deal
with globalisation. 
<P>
Forum 2000 is to be hosted by The State of the World Forum, a non-
profit organisation working for sustainable globalisation. It will
bring together the different viewpoints on globalisation ''for the
first time ever, in a global town hall meeting,'' President of the
State of the World Forum, Jim Garrison, told IPS. 
<P>
The meeting is timed to coincide with the United Nations (UN)
Millennium Summit (Sep. 6-8), convened by UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to adopt a global vision for the 21st Century. More
than 150 heads of government will attend the Millennium Summit.  
<P>
''Unlike recent international meetings in Seattle, Davos and
Washington, D.C. - where dissenting views were heard only on the
streets - this meeting will bring all of globalisation's varied
stakeholders to the same table to discuss issues of mutual
concern,'' Nils Hoffman, Press Co-ordinator, said of Forum 2000. 
<P>
''Institutions governing globalisation are all limited to
representatives of sovereign states, but in reality globalisation
affects everyone. As a minimum we need to create a mechanism for
the stakeholders to meet across the table. My instinct, from the
experience of democracy, is how these types of matters can be
solved through diverse discussions,'' Garrison said. 
<P>
''We are taking the creative leadership to break through the
dialectic,'' he added. 
<P>
Former Soviet President and Founding Member of The State of the
World Forum, Mikhail Gorbachev, will chair the initial stages of
Forum 2000 in New York, Sep. 4 - 10. 
<P>
It will include the co-chairs Thabo Mbeki, President of South
Africa, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Prime Minister of Japan (1982-87),
Jehan Sadat, First Lady of Egypt (1970-81), Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, President of Haiti (1991-1996) and Nobel Peace Prize
Laureate, Desmond Tutu. 
<P>
Over 1,000 people from more than 80 countries are expected to
participate. The participants are representing all of
globalisation's key issue areas, from science and technology to
business and spirituality. They include AOL Chairman Steve Case
and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. 
<P>
Over 35 heads of state have been invited to attend the Forum.
Twelve have accepted the invitation. They include heads of
government from South Africa, New Zealand, Senegal, Colombia,
Gambia and Cost Rica. Foreign Ministers from Thailand, Indonesia
and Turkey have said they will attend. 
<P>
A release has been issued in advance of Forum 2000 to brief
participants for a post-Seattle (World Trade Organisation meeting)
dialogue on globalisation. 
<P>
''It is aimed at convincing people that globalisation has really
replaced the Cold War as the organising framework for human
affairs,'' Garrison said. 
<P>
The State of the World Forum analysed trends and projections
compiled by the United Nations and other agencies in economic
development, international trade, communications, culture, labour,
environment, health, human development and religion. The report
concludes that globalisation will change the world as radically in
the 21st Century as democratisation changed it in the 20th
Century. 
<P>
''Globalisation has become a powerful force to be reckoned with.
It has as much power to change lives as the move from monarchy
toward democracy that took place in the 20th Century,'' Garrison
concluded. 
<P>
As a result of globalisation, the report states, the percentage of
people with access to telephones, television, the Internet and
radio is at its highest level ever, empowering many with
information they never had access to before. 
<P>
''Globalisation comes down to much more than just communications
and economics.  We must look at it in terms of workers' rights,
the environment, culture, health, ethics and development as
well,'' Garrison said. 
<P>
In 1900, no country had voting rights for all adults. Today, 70
percent of countries have universal adult franchise. 
<P>
In the developing world, where 80 percent of the world's
population resides, the lack of access to modern communications
systems has contributed to much slower economic growth and the
largest ever income gap between developed and developing nations.
The average GNP per capita in high-income countries is now 25,510
dollars, while it is only 520 dollars on average in all low-income
countries. 
<P>
The report also notes that developing countries that have
attracted jobs from overseas due to low labour rates also have
poor protections for workers. Workers lack pension benefits and
health insurance and some employers force long work hours or
dangerous conditions without ample safety precautions, according
to the report. 
<P>
There is an increasing number of health problems that have only
plagued the development world are now found in the developing
world, the report concludes. 
<P>
In 1990, the most important global health risks were lower
respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases and conditions arising
during perinatal periods.  By 2020, major global health threats
are expected to match those in the United States and other
industrial countries, such as heart disease, major depression,
traffic accidents and cerebrovascular disease, it says. 
<P>
Telecommunications is also considered a key indicator of global
inequality. The average industrial country has 251 fax machines
per 10,000 residents, while the average developing country has
only five per 10,000.  A person in an industrialised country
spends an average of 43 minutes on international calls per year,
while a person in the developing world spends only three minutes,
it is reported. 
<P>
The State of the World Forum is planning to hold a meeting similar
to Forum 2000 in Prague, Czech Republic, from Sep. 26 to 28. This
second forum will coincide with the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, also being
held in Prague. 
<P>
''We need to add a third ingredient to a potentially polarised and
violent situation. Anti-globalisation protestors are gaining more
and more public support and there is no receptivity to this on
behalf of the IMF or World Bank,'' Garrison explained.
