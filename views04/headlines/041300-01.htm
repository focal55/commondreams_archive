WASHINGTON, April 12 -- A coalition of 21 environmental groups 
complained to President Clinton today that the administration was 
about to side with the coal industry 
and undercut a federal court decision 
that would restrict the strip mining 
of Appalachian mountaintops.

<p> "We ask you to ensure that no 
federal agency takes any action that 
would compromise our clean water 
laws by allowing the continuation of 
dumping of millions of tons of mining 
waste into our waterways," the 
group declared in a letter to Mr. 
Clinton after a meeting with administration officials.

<p>   At the meeting, the environmentalists said,  the officials  clearly signaled a threat to the court ruling last 
October.

<p> In that decision, which Senator 
Robert C. Byrd, Democrat  of West 
Virginia,  denounced as the potential 
death knell for the region's mining 
industry, Chief Judge Charles H. Haden II  of  Federal  District Court in 
Charleston, W. Va., found that the 
state had for years violated federal 
mining and clean-water laws by permitting the blockage of hundreds of 
miles of vital valley streams with the 
waste from mountaintop mining.   
<p>

<p> State and industry officials defended the dumping as permissible 
and well controlled under mining and 
clean water laws. But a group of 
West Virginia residents and environmentalists successfully sued by  complaining that communities in the 
mountain hollows were being devastated by the blockage of waterways.

<p> Senator Byrd,   state officials and 
union lobbyists sought to block the 
ruling in a rider to a bill last year. 
The plan  was dropped after  the 
White House warned that the president would veto the bill if it included 
the rider. But now, the environmental groups say,  the administration 
appears on the verge of reversing 
that support of Judge Haden's finding, which is currently under appeal. 

<p> In the critical next step in the 
appeals process, the Clinton administration is scheduled to file a brief on 
Monday. At  a meeting on Tuesday 
with Department of Justice legal 
specialists, the environmental 
groups concluded the brief would undercut the mountaintop decision, the 
environmentalists said.

<p> Administration officials declined 
to discuss the likely contents of the 
appeal brief but contended that the 
issue was more complicated than 
suggested by the warning letter.

<p> "We are considering seriously a 
variety of legal approaches to take to 
this and haven't definitively decided 
yet," Lois J. Schiffer, the assistant 
attorney general for the environment,  who met with the  groups on 
Tuesday, said in an interview. 

<p> Of the letter to the president, Ms. 
Schiffer said, "We think it misses 
that what we are doing is really 
interpreting two complicated and interrelated statutes in a way that protects both the environment and 
jobs." She referred to the laws controlling surface mining and clean 
waters.   
<p>  "We of course would prefer a 
negotiated settlement here and we 
worked very hard at it," Ms. Schiffer 
said,  "but we're not likely to be there 
by Monday."

<p> Environmental groups said Judge 
Haden's ruling covered both laws 
and that talk of a negotiated settlement seemed to be an attempt at 
circumventing the decision or easing 
its effects.

<p> Judge Haden shocked the coal industry in criticizing the "mountaintop removal" technique,  in which 
coal near the surface is scooped up 
by mammoth machines after earth 
and rocks covering it are dynamited 
and bulldozed away.   
<p>      "If there is any 
life form that cannot acclimate to life 
deep in a rubble  pile, it is eliminated," the judge said,  ordering the 
West Virginia authorities to curb 
much of the waste dumping into  waterways. "No  effect on related environmental values is more adverse 
than obliteration."

<p> The environmental groups said 
they feared that the administration, 
in an election-year attempt to protect 
jobs, would revive earlier arguments 
of the Army Corps of Engineers and 
other federal agencies that the the 
waste dumping is  legitimate under 
current law.

<p> "The meeting was very discouraging," said Joan Mulhern, legislative 
director for the Earth Justice Legal 
Defense Fund. "It would be ironic if 
a week before the 30th anniversary 
of Earth Day the administration decides it's O.K. to blow the tops off of 
mountains and bury streams and rivers to get coal."

<p> Courtney Cuff, legislative director 
for Friends of the Earth, said that 
should the administration side with 
the coal industry, environmental 
groups would pursue the issue into 
the presidential campaign and seek a 
firm endorsement of Judge Haden's 
ruling from Vice President Al Gore. 

<p> In the letter to the president, the 
environmentalists declared, "We ask 
that you protect the environment and 
communities in Appalachia, not the 
coal industry."
