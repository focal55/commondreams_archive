WASHINGTON<wbr>--<wbr>The U.S. intelligence community is writing a secret report warning
the Clinton administration that construction of a national missile
defense could trigger a wave of destabilizing events around the world and
possibly endanger relations with European allies, a U.S. intelligence
official said Thursday.
<p>The new National Intelligence Estimate will sketch an unsettling
series of political and military ripple effects from the proposed U.S.
deployment that would include a sharp buildup of strategic and
medium-range nuclear missiles by China, India and Pakistan and the
further spread of missile technology in the Middle East.
<p>A supplement to the highly classified report will also note that the
threat of attack from North Korea has eased since last fall, when
Pyongyang effectively froze its ballistic-missile testing program in
response to U.S. overtures.
<p>Outside critics have long argued that the proposed national missile
defense could backfire and actually diminish national security and global
stability. But the CIA-led analysis and updated threat assessment are the
first official evaluation of how the system could generate new threats.
<p>The administration has pledged to decide this fall whether to proceed
with an initial base of 100 "interceptor" missiles in Alaska, backed by
ground-based phased radar stations and satellite-based infrared sensors,
in a system designed to shield the continental United States from a
limited missile attack.
<p>Proponents of the system argue that North Korea, Iran or Iraq may
threaten U.S. territory with intercontinental ballistic missiles someday.
Critics argue that the threat is exaggerated, that the antimissile
technology is unproved and that deployment would undermine crucial arms
control and nonproliferation regimes.
<p>CIA analysts believe that Russia would accept U.S. arguments that no
system could protect against the number of missiles Moscow could launch
and that its deterrent thus would be preserved. But China has only 20
CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missiles in vulnerable silos, and the
analysts say that, after a U.S. deployment, Beijing would conclude that
it had lost its deterrent force--and act accordingly.
<p>"We can tell the Russians that [the missile defense] won't affect the
viability of their deterrent force," the intelligence official said. "I
don't know how we can say that to the Chinese with a straight face."
<p>If the U.S. system is built, the CIA believes, China would install
multiple independent nuclear warheads on its missiles for the first time
in an effort to overwhelm any missile shield. Beijing has possessed the
technology for more than a decade but has not used it so far.
<p>In addition, Beijing is deemed likely to build several dozen mobile
truck-based DF-31 missiles, which it first tested last year, to create a
more survivable force. It also is likely to add such countermeasures as
booster fragmentation, low-power jammers, chaff and simple decoys to
confuse or evade U.S. interceptors.
<p>The intelligence official said that Russia and China both would
increase proliferation, including "selling countermeasures for sure" to
such nations as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Syria.
<p>Moreover, the official said, India is deemed likely to increase its
nuclear missile force if it detects a sharp buildup by China, its
neighbor and longtime rival. That, in turn, likely would spur Pakistan,
India's archenemy, to increase its own nuclear strike force, the official
said.
<p>Former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft called such a
scenario "plausible" and expressed concern about its possible
implications.
<p>"We ought to think whether we want the Chinese to change their very
minimalist strategy," he said in a telephone interview. "I'm not sure
what the answer is, but this is certainly one of the possible
consequences that, in a sense, is more serious than the Russian reaction
might be."
<b><br>
<p>The Likelihood of a Domino Effect
</b>
<p>Other specialists said that, while it is likely China would move to
increase its intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal--now thought to
be about 20 strong--it is questionable whether India and Pakistan would
follow suit.
<p>"China has had a strategic capability for a long time relative to
India, and India has hardly gone on a missile arms race to counter it,"
noted John E. Peters, an arms control specialist at Rand Corp., a Santa
Monica-based think tank.
<p>Michael O'Hanlin, who tracks the missile defense issue at the
Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, argued
that, however dramatic it may sound, a domino-style nuclear arms buildup
would be a lesser threat to the United States than China's potential
willingness to develop and sell missile defense countermeasures to
countries like North Korea. Arms control specialists have expressed
strong concern that the missile defense system as designed would be
incapable of overcoming relatively cheap and easy-to-deploy
countermeasures, such as clusters of decoys.
<p>"If they do that, it could defeat the entire purpose of the national
missile defense," O'Hanlin said. "That is the scenario that's very
important."
<p>Further afield, the intelligence official who outlined the report
said, America's allies in Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization could be angered if the United States is seen to be walling
itself off from its allies with an antimissile shield.
<b><br>
<p>N. Korea's Test Program Frozen
</b>
<p>The updated threat assessment notes that North Korea has frozen its
program to test an intercontinental ballistic missile--the Taepo-Dong
2--since the administration proposed relaxing economic and diplomatic
sanctions last year.
<p>The missile still could be tested on short notice, the official said,
and related tests of the system's electronics, pumps, tanks and other
equipment are still going on.
<p>CIA analysts, who warned last year that Iran may try to test an
intercontinental ballistic missile by 2010, have detected little progress
in Tehran's program. "We're not seeing some of the things we expected,"
the official said. "We're not seeing the threat advance."
<p>The White House requested the intelligence estimate as part of its
decision-making review.
<p>The analysis, to be delivered next month, presents two different
scenarios of how other nations are likely to react to a U.S. deployment.
<p>The first is based on the premise that Russia agrees to U.S. demands
to amend the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty of 1972 to allow a missile
shield. The second assesses the effect if Russia refuses and Washington
simply abandons the arms control process, as many Republicans have
demanded.
<p>At the moment, Russia and China are the only potential adversaries
capable of hitting the United States with nuclear missiles. Russia has
about 1,000 strategic missiles and 4,500 warheads.
<p>The report pointedly declines to describe North Korea and other
hostile states as "rogue" nations, since the argot suggests that their
leaders are irrational.
<p>"The term rogue state almost predisposes you in favor of" the missile
defense system, the intelligence official said.
<p>Moreover, the report warns that the missile defense shield would not
protect Americans against what the official called "more accurate, more
reliable and much cheaper" ways of delivering chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons. These include ship-launched missiles, suitcase bombs and
other covert means.
<p>"The joke here is, if you want to bring a nuclear weapon into the
United States, just hide it in some drugs," the official said.
