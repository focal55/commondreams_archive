VIEQUES, Puerto Rico - Since U.S. military maneuvers were halted about a year ago, fat sea grape bushes and green vegetation have overtaken the scarred earth--and the spent and unexploded ordnance littering it--that surrounds the Monte David protest camp in the heart of the Navy bombing range here.
<p>
Carlos Zenon, a 60-year-old fisherman who has fought against the Navy presence on Vieques for decades, pointed to the new growth in explaining some of the difficulties federal authorities will have in removing the dozens of protesters camped out on the target range.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p>
"We know where the bombs are," Zenon said, with just a trace of a smile. "They don't."</p>

Some protesters, like Zenon, pledge to scatter into the brush once the impending raid takes place. Most say they will either stand or simply flop over with their wrists held in front of them, while others plan to submerge themselves in the blue Caribbean waters surrounding the Camp Garcia bombing range at the eastern end of this Puerto Rican island town.</p>
<p>
The dozens of protesters camped out in defiance of President Clinton's Jan. 31 order to reopen the range say they are ready for a federal raid. Puerto Rico government sources have indicated that the raid is set for early Tuesday morning. But federal government sources said the raid would happen later in the week.</p>
<p>
The appearance of two Navy warships and a destroyer in the waters surrounding Vieques early Monday increased expectations that a large-scale federal raid to remove the protesters would take place.</p>
<p>
The bombing range encampments were born over a year ago in the wake of the April 19, 1999, death of civilian security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, who was killed by an errant Navy bomb during a botched practice run. The accident unleashed pent-up resentment in Vieques and across Puerto Rico that had been building since land was expropriated from local residents in the 1940s to create the bombing range. Top Navy officials insist there is nowhere else that the Atlantic Fleet can conduct exercises with aircraft dropping bombs, ships firing shells and Marines storming a beach all at once.</p>
<p>
The administration of Gov. Pedro Rossello and the Clinton administration reached an agreement in January that both sides believed would end the impasse.</p>
<p>
In exchange for $40 million up front, Puerto Rican officials agreed to let the Navy conduct exercises this spring with "dummy" bombs containing no explosives. But at a date still to be determined--sometime between this August and February 2002--the people of Vieques will vote in a referendum on whether to permit the Navy to resume using live ammunition. If the voters say yes, the people of Vieques will get an additional $50 million in aid, for a total of $90 million. If they vote "no," the Navy must clean up its practice range and halt all training by May 1, 2003.</p>
<p>
Various local and national news media reports, citing a variety of Pentagon and Clinton administration sources, have said the raid to remove protesters would be led by the FBI and the Justice Department. The Puerto Rico Police Department is expected to provide crowd control in the civilian population center on Vieques, where the island's 9,300 residents live.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Coast Guard is expected to help in patrolling waters off Navy-owned land on Vieques--22,000 of its 33,000 acres--while a contingent of about 1,000 Marines is slated to land once the range is cleared to guard its perimeter from further incursions by protesters.</p>
<p>
Local media also are reporting that ferry and airplane transportation, as well as telephone communications, between Vieques and the main island of Puerto Rico will be interrupted during the operation.</p>
<p>
Mara Benitez, a 35-year-old educator from New York who is spending her vacation at the camps, said the demonstrators have a plan ready when the raid happens. "No one will get hurt," she said, "and the struggle will continue."</p>
<p>
Protest leaders have been keeping a tight rein on the camps as reports of imminent arrests increase. They say they don't want too many people on Navy property when the arrests happen, to avoid violence and avoid jeopardizing what they say is their strategy.</p>
<p>
"The camps are the only thing that has stopped the Navy from bombing," said Luis R. Agosto Rivera, a 22-year-old university student who has been coming to the camps for one-week stretches since November.</p>
<p>
Puerto Rican Independence Party President Ruben Berrios, who has spent the entire year since Sanes Rodriguez's death at a beachfront encampment, said that a federal raid would exact a high "political price" for the Clinton administration, referring to a backlash among Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>
For many protesters, who say Navy helicopters fly low over camps almost daily, the reports of an impending raid are just more of the "psychological warfare" the Navy has been waging against them all year. Others in the camps hold out hope that it will be called off at the last moment.</p>
<p>
"I don't know if they are coming. I know it will be a big mistake for President Clinton if they do," Zenon said. "Who's going to stop all the Puerto Ricans who are going to take our place?"</p>
<p>
Despite reports of the large contingent of Marines en route to protect the bombing range perimeter following the raid, protest leaders say more people will try to infiltrate the base once the arrests begin.</p>
<p>
"This is the first chapter; the second one is going to be better," said Magali Santos, 57, a San Juan restaurateur who has joined the camps. "After they clear us, then the second wave of people will come."</p>
<p>
On Sunday evening, when rumors swept through town that the raid would take place Monday morning rather than Tuesday, a handful of people manned the encampment in front of the main gate to Camp Garcia, which has been controlled by protesters since December.</p>
<p>
The protesters lazily played dominoes and watched the evening news under a wooden shelter they constructed near a large sign that read "377 days of peace, yanked from the oppressor," referring to the number of days that have passed since the bombing range has been closed.</p>
<p>
"No one has pushed the panic button yet, but we're ready for anything," said one protester, 37-year-old Angel de Leon. "We've been ready for 377 days."</p>
