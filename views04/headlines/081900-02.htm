GENEVA  - A U.N. human rights body called on
Friday for the lifting of 10-year-old sanctions on Iraq, saying
they had ``condemned an innocent people to hunger, disease,
ignorance and even death.''
<p>The United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and
Protection of Human Rights also adopted a separate resolution
urging states to reconsider their support for economic
sanctions in general if they failed to bring about the desired
changes in policy.

</TABLE>The sub-commission, composed of 26 human rights experts
named by their respective governments to serve in a personal
capacity, adopted the two resolutions without a vote on the
final day of their annual three-week meeting in Geneva.
<p>It was the fourth year in a row that the body dealt with
the controversial issue of Iraqi sanctions.
<p>This week's debate became heated after Belgian's member
called the sanctions ``unequivocally illegal'' which had caused a
humanitarian disaster ``comparable to the worst catastrophes of
the past decades.''
<p>The resolution proposed by Morocco's representative urged
all governments, including that of Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein, to alleviate the Iraqi people's suffering by
facilitating the delivery of food and medical supplies.
<p>Iraq has been under an international economic and trade
embargo since its August 1990 invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="2">Oil-For-Food Deal Not Meeting All Needs -- Report</font></b></font>
<p>The text said statistics issued by the U.N. oil-for-food
program, which since December 1996 has allowed Iraq to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and other
essentials, showed the deal was meeting ``only part of the vital
needs of the population.''
<p>It noted with concern that ``the standard of living,
nutrition and health of the population were continuing to
deteriorate and that all economic activities were seriously
affected, particularly in the areas of drinking water supply,
electricity and agriculture.''
<p>The Iraq resolution invoked the 1949 Geneva Conventions
which it said ``prohibit the starving of civilian populations
and the destruction of what is indispensable to their
survival.''
<p>In the second resolution, put forward by Norway's member,
the Sub-Commission urged states to reconsider their support for
sanctions ``even when legitimate goals pursued have not yet been
achieved, if, after a reasonable period, the measures have not
brought about the desired changes in policy.''
<p>It urged states to seek ``prompt termination of all aspects
of sanctions regimes that adversely affect human rights.''
<p>On Thursday, the United States hit out angrily at the
Belgian's report. George Moose, U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations in Geneva, told the forum that his claim that the
sanctions were illegal was ``incorrect, biased and
inflammatory.''
<p>``The United States has worked hard to ensure that the
welfare of the Iraqi people is protected, in stark contrast to
the appalling behavior of an Iraqi regime which has shown
itself to be completely insensitive to the suffering of its own
people,'' Moose told the Sub-Commission.
<p>The United States strongly opposes any lifting of the
sanctions which have now entered their 11th year, and maintains
that Saddam is responsible for the suffering of his people.
