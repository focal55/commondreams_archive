Stung by the violent protests that wrecked global trade talks last year, Group of Eight leaders will address AIDS, the environment and food safety in Tokyo this week.
<p>They want to answer people's worries about globalization by confronting their day-to-day problems at a July 21-23 G8 summit in the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.</p>
<p>It will be US President Bill Clinton's last summit before leaving the White House in January, and the big international debut for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Under the theme "Greater Peace of Mind," they will discuss people's daily worries; food security, ageing populations in rich countries, the environment and the future opened up by the mapping of the human genome.</p>
<p>The economic theme, "Greater Prosperity," also tries to stay close to Earth; the core subject is information technology -- the Internet -- and how to close the gap between those who have it and those who don't.</p>
<p>The more classical subject of development is directed at the fight against epidemics; AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; the complaints of the world's poor who see few benefits from globalisation.</p>
<p>The Group of Seven richest nations, now with Russia swelling its ranks, dates back a quarter of a century and realizes it must stay relevant, and up to date.</p>
<p>"How do the decisions taken here affect people on the planet, and in what way are they legitimate?" asked one European diplomat.</p>
<p>That's why this year they want to be "the least abstract possible, and to touch people's lives," he added.</p>
<p>While deploying an overwhelming security force, with 20,000 police from around the country, Japan wants to tread softly in dealing with the crowds of protesters.</p>
<p>Many demonstrators now troop to international gatherings armed with the knowledge that they derailed the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle last December. Incidently, G8 leaders would call in Okinawa for an early launch of multilateral trade talks, to overcome the failure to do so in Seattle.</p>
<p>For domestic political reasons, Japan's goverment chose to organise the summit outside of Tokyo for the first time with the paradoxical result of laying fertile ground for protests, which are rare here.</p>
<p>People in Okinawa are increasingly fed up with the enormous US military bases dotted around the island since the Cold War.</p>
<p>Tensions were aggravated this month when a US marine was arrested for breaking into an unlocked apartment and fondling a 14-year-old Japanese girl in her bed.</p>
<p>A non-governmental organisation centre, set up by the Japanese foreign ministry, will open from July 20-24 in Nago city, the Okinawan city that hosts the summit.</p>
<p>"The goal is to allow the NGOs to hear our reports and to give their own press conferences," said Japanese foreign ministry spokesman Ryuichiro Yamazaki.</p>
<p>With the same motive of allaying any questions about the summit's legitimacy, Japan has helped arrange for the developing world to have a part to play in this meeting of the world's richest nations.</p>
<p>On July 20, the government is organising a Tokyo meeting between at least six of the G8 members and the spokesmen for the poor countries; South African President Thabo Mbeki, now head of the Non Aligned Movement, his Nigerian counterpart, who chairs the Group of 77, and the Thai Prime Minister whose country chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the last session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).</p>
