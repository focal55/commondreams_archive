<p>Sometimes when she was walking by herself, alone beneath her broad-brimmed hat with 90 years of memories, she'd count off her steps, 1,400 to the mile, and add the miles on her fingers, like an abacus.
<p>
She might also recite Robert Frost as she went, or dedicate a stretch of highway to the girls from the Monday morning Scrabble game back in New Hampshire, or think about her late husband, Jim, her companion of 62 years, gone now these last seven.
<p>
Mile after mile, state after state, week after week, Doris Haddock--"like the fish"--spent most of the past 12 months marching east from California, in a classic American 3,200-mile, cross-country pilgrimage of protest.
<p>
Yesterday, bent from arthritis, working on her fourth hat and fourth pair of sneakers since leaving Pasadena and surrounded by a throng of jesters, activists and jostling TV crews, she entered Washington.
<p>
She said her cause is campaign finance reform--which she takes to the steps of the Capitol today.
<p>
"I feel very strongly that democracy is being threatened by the illegal money that is being given to our candidates by corporations and unions and wealthy men," she said. "So that we are shifting from being a country that is a government of the people by the people and for the people . . . [to] an oligarchy or something else, not a democracy. So I'm fighting to get back to that."
<p>
But like so many other grand treks of conscience, her crusade seemed to have evolved beyond finance reform.
<p>
There was talk of Lincoln, and FDR, and the country, and age, and death, as she recounted her walk yesterday, and you could almost hear Woody Guthrie strumming in the background.
<p>
At one point she paused to rest on the warm stone steps of a Georgetown park, sipping water from a plastic cup, and told her story with a broad New Hampshire accent and a face wrinkled as if by a sculptor's knife.
<p>
She looked tanned and exhilarated, surrounded by young people carrying flags that crackled in the wind, and cellular phones to coordinate coverage, telling people to make sure to visit www.grannyD.com. 
<p>
She has false teeth, two hearing aids, arthritis in her back and gnarled hands, pains that go from here to there, and might easily have been folded into a wheelchair someplace.
<p>
"I could fall down dead five minutes from now, and no one would be surprised," she said, chuckling.
<p>
But, by God, she had walked to Washington city and she'd made it.
<p>
"I'm traveling as a pilgrim seeking food and shelter," she said. "I haven't missed a meal, and I haven't slept on the ground. People are very kind in this country."
<p>
A former member of the planning board in rural Dublin--1,400 residents occupying the road that runs between Keene and Nashua--Haddock said she has been a lifelong social activist.
<p>
She and her husband had demonstrated in Alaska in the 1950s against proposed nuclear weapons tests there.
<p>
She'd also worked against domestic abuse, and when Jim came down with Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s, she joined the crusade against that, too.
<p>
"He had a very fine mind, and it was hell to see it deteriorate," she said. "We were married in 1930. He was just out of Amherst College, and I was at Emerson. I had been there three years, and we eloped."
<p>
She started going on about campaign finance reform several years ago, her son Jim, 65, said yesterday. Suddenly, in 1998, she announced she was going to do something about it.
<p>
He was not all that surprised and felt it would do her good.
<p>
"How often do you see a 90-year-old lady who's living at the height of excitement of her life?" he said as he walked with her and about 50 others across the Key Bridge yesterday.
<p>
She had started in Pasadena in January 1999, a kind of protest outrider to the Rose Parade, wearing the garden hat of a dear friend who had just died. Although she is neither a Democrat nor a Republican, she said, they wouldn't let her ride a float because she was "political."
<p>
Watched over and supported by family and friends in a chase car, she struck out across California, got stuck in a sandstorm in the Mojave desert, became dehydrated and was hospitalized for four days.
<p>
Undaunted, she pressed on across Arizona and New Mexico and watched the spring flowers bloom in west Texas. She traversed Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland, where she used cross-country skis to travel the towpath of the C&amp;O Canal.
<p>
She'd count the miles with her steps and fingers and recite Frost's poem, "Mending Wall."
<p>
"Sometimes a mile seems long, and I dedicate it to someone at home," she said. "I have three friends I play Scrabble with every Monday morning, and they all have taken on quite a few miles."
<p>
On she walked.
<p>
"Every single one of the states are beautiful and just a joy to walk through, and every one of the people that I met was very kind," she said.
<p>
She reported that the state of the union is sound. "We cannot be kept down," she said. "Our people love their country. And they hate what is going on.
<p>
"I think the people who did not believe in campaign finance reform stayed away from me, because that's all I got was people who said, 'You are walking for me, Granny. You are my voice. You are my voice. You are my face. And God bless you.'
<p>
"The mission is my passion," she said. "I am a very poor woman. I live on Social Security and a small income. I have 12 great-grandchildren, and I have nothing to leave for them. So I said, 'Well, I can leave the legacy of a democracy. I want them to be brought up in a democracy.
<p>
"So I will walk the walk and see if I can do that."
