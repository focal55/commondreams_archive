WASHINGTON<wbr>--<wbr>A Justice Department study has found that black convicts in the
federal penal system face the death penalty much more often than white
prisoners, confirming the arguments of those who say that capital
punishment is not applied uniformly.
<p>The statistical survey, the first comprehensive study of the federal
death penalty since it was reinstated in 1988, found a wide racial
disparity in recommendations for capital punishment from federal
prosecutors across the country. Roughly three-fourths of federal
defendants recommended for capital punishment over the last five years
were minorities.
<p>President Clinton said that the figures raise concerns "since we're
supposed to have a uniform law of the land." But he added that there had
been "no suggestion, as far as I know, that any of the [federal] cases
where convictions occurred were wrongly decided."
<p>With the fairness of capital punishment figuring in the presidential
campaign, the findings promptly led to renewed calls from some members of
Congress, legal groups and human rights organizations for a federal
moratorium on executions.
<p>Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, however, rejected a moratorium on the federal
death penalty, saying that such a delay "goes to the issue of people who
were wrongfully charged," which the department's survey does not address.
<p>Instead, Reno called for additional research and said that
overrepresentation of minorities on federal death rows reflects racial
and economic disparities throughout the criminal justice system and
points to the connection between crime and higher rates of economic and
social problems in minority communities.
<p>More than anything, Reno said, the survey's findings may reflect that
"our system, our society, is not fair to a large number of minority
children . . . who do not have equal opportunities."
<p>While the figures "should be a concern to us all," she said, so long
as poverty, drug abuse and unequal opportunities continue to take an
especially heavy toll on black youths, "we will continue to see
disparities in the number of minorities in the criminal justice system."
The study found that, of 682 defendants charged with federal crimes
subject to the death penalty, 20% were white and 80% were minorities.
U.S. attorneys recommended that the death penalty be sought for 183 of
them--26% of them white and 74% minorities.
<p>Reno approved seeking death penalties for 159 of those 183
defendants--28% of whom were white and 72% minorities, the majority of
them black.
<p>Deputy Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., who supervised the study, said
that he was "personally and professionally disturbed by the [racial]
disparity," which showed that "minorities are overrepresented" on federal
death rows.
<p>The study also found geographic differences in application of the
federal death penalty. Just nine of the 94 U.S. attorney districts
accounted for 43% of all death penalty recommendations. They are Puerto
Rico, two in the New York region, western Missouri, western Tennessee,
northern Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Virginia and Maryland.
<p>Although state systems were not included in the Justice Department's
survey, Reno said that she believes the racial disparities "may be
roughly the same."
<b><br>
<p>Study Based on Recommendations
</b>
<p>During the latest five-year span, 20 defendants have received death
sentences from federal judges or juries. Only a fifth of them are white.
<p>But the Justice Department study focused on the recommendations of its
own officials in Washington and its top prosecutors in the field, not on
actual death sentences meted out in the federal system.
<p>In the federal system, capital punishment is reserved for such
offenses as terrorist bombings, violence in some drug crimes, violence at
international airports, assassination of government officials and violent
crimes in aid of racketeering activity.
<p>To achieve more uniformity, Reno established a new system in 1995.
U.S. attorneys now must submit cases to a review committee in Washington.
Reno herself then has to approve the death penalty when it is sought for
federal defendants. Neither the review team members nor Reno are told the
race of a defendant.
<p>The report noted that "overall, the federal government continues to
play a relatively small role in administering the death penalty in this
country." From 1930 to 1999, state governments executed 4,400 defendants,
mostly for murder convictions, which generally are state crimes. In the
same period, the federal government put to death only 33 defendants and
has not carried out any executions since 1963.
<b><br>
<p>Leaders Urge Delay of Executions
</b>
<p>The Supreme Court in 1972 struck down state death penalty laws on
grounds that they were being applied unfairly, a ruling that also brought
federal executions to a halt, even though there had been none during the
previous nine years. The court later reinstated the death penalty after
the adoption of new procedures.
<p>The federal government revised its procedures in 1988, when Congress
passed the Drug Kingpin Act, making the death penalty a possible
punishment for some drug-related offenses.
<p>Under the previous system, which was in effect from 1988 to 1994, 52
defendants were submitted by U.S. attorneys to their Justice Department
superiors for approval of death penalty recommendations. In that period,
racial disparities were similar to those of the last five years, the
study showed.
<p>About 13% of those defendants were white, 75% were black, and most of
the remainder were Latino.
<p>Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), a chief sponsor of bipartisan
legislation to guarantee DNA tests to certain federal inmates, called the
Justice Department study "more clear evidence that the death penalty
system is broken" and that "this is a national problem."
<p>Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) renewed his demand and that of five
other members of Congress that Clinton postpone any federal executions
until a commission can study the issue.
<p>Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) called for a moratorium similar to
the one imposed in Illinois last January by Republican Gov. George Ryan.
"We should not have business as usual," Jackson said.
<p>William F. Schulz, executive director of the human rights group
Amnesty International, said that "no one should be surprised that the
federal death penalty is displaying the same lottery-like qualities that
plague capital justice at a state level." He also urged a national
moratorium on executions.
