<p>Buoyed by a string of recent
campaign
successes, consumer groups around the world are now demanding
mandatory
labelling of genetically modified (GM) food as they mark World
Consumer
Rights Day on March 15, reflecting growing concern about the
unregulated
production and trade of GM food crops.
<P>
	Mandatory labelling, insist the groups, would enable consumers to
make
informed choices û a basic consumer right. It would also protect
their  right
to safety by allowing any subsequent health problems to be
properly
identified and traced back to source. 
<P>
	Genetic engineering takes the DNA of genes from one organism
(animals,
plants, bacteria) and inserts them into a completely different
organism
(e.g. food crops) to transfer a desired trait. Plants are
genetically
modified to improve resistance to pests and weed-killers. But
activists
worry about the long-term effects of tampering with nature. 
<P>
	Creating herbicide-tolerant crops is like ''giving one plant a
radiation
suit, then dropping a small nuclear device to wipe out all other
plant life
in the area, as well as the animal life that depends on it, along
with any
hope of sustainable agriculture,'' wrote Andrew Simms of Christian
Aid. 
<P>
	Consumers are reacting with growing concern, says Julian Edwards,
the
director general of <a href="http://www.consumersinternational.org/wcrd/">Consumers International</a>, a federation of over
250
consumers' organisations in 111 countries. 
<P>
	Foremost is the fear that GM crops might be dangerous to eat in
some way,
he points out, saying that consumers face risks from the
unintended effects
of GM foods. 
<P>
	Edwards was speaking here at the launch last week of a CI
campaign kit to
heighten awareness of consumer rights using the theme <a href="http://www.consumersinternational.org/wcrd/">'Our Food,
Whose
Choice? Consumers Take Action on GM Foods'</a>. 
<P>
	Genetic modification can transfer allergies from foods that
people know
they are allergic to to foods they think are safe. About 2 percent
of
adults and 8 percent of children have true food allergies and
about one
quarter have
reacted adversely to some type of food. 
<P>
	''Failure to label GM foods,'' says the CI campaign kit, ''would
mean that
people with allergies have no way of knowing whether they are
eating
potentially risky foods or, in the event of problems, what
ingredient
provoked the reaction.'' 
<P>
	Activists also highlight the uncertain long-term effects on
nutrition and
health posed by GM foods. They point to the use of antibiotic-
resistant
genes as ''markers'' (to track the gene carrying the trait being
transferred)
in GM crops, which, they say, could add to the problem of
antibiotic
resistance. Genetic manipulation, argue the activists, could also
increase
levels of natural plant toxins in foods or create entirely new
toxins in
unexpected ways. 
<P>
	''The testing has not been as rigorous as it is with medicine,''
says
physician Nadine Gusman, a World Health Organisation consultant.
Gusman
wondered who was carrying out the research. Were they the same
firms
developing the technology, she asks. 
<P>
	The other major risk, notes Edward, is the impact GM foods will
have on
the environment: ''Do they support sustainable agriculture in the
long  run?'' 
<P>
	Critics say genes from GM crops could contaminate wild plants,
which could
then become resistant or toxic to certain plant pests. The wind,
birds, and
insects could carry pollen from GM plants and once released may
cause
permanent gene pollution. Crops engineered to resist herbicide and
pesticides may pass their traits on to their wild relatives and
create
pesticide-and herbicide-resistant super-weeds, they say. 
<P>
	GM organisms also threaten to diminish biological diversity, say
the
activists. The cultivation of GM organisms, they add, could lead
to the
wiping out of weeds and insects. If that happens, the species that
depend on
them will also suffer. 
<P>
	There is also the question of seed ownership by big firms through
patenting and terminator technology. ''Farmers in the South are
angry
because they don't feel that anyone should own their seeds,'' says
Jennife r
Mourin, the Safe Food Campaign Coordinator of the Pesticide Action
Network's Asia-Pacific
office in Penang. 
<P>
	The main commercially cultivated GM foods are soya, maize, rape
seed
(canola), potatoes and tomatoes. GM soya is present in about 60
percent of
all soy derivatives, including vegetable oils, soy flour, lecithin
and soy
protein. GM corn can be found in 50 percent of all corn products
and
derivatives, such as corn starch, corn flour and corn syrup. 
<P>
	Over 90 percent of these processed foods are excluded from
European Union
labelling norms, the most stringent in the world. 
<P>
	Other GM foods expected soon include rice, sugar, and beets.
Animal feed
is the principal market for GM crops. Some 98 percent of global
transgenic
crop acreage is accounted for by just three countries: the United
States,
Canada, and Argentina. The US has by far the largest acreage at
20.5
million hectares or 74 percent of the GM fields as of 1998. 
<P>
	The Rio Declaration of the 1992 Earth Summit stated that
governments have
to take a ''better safe than sorry'' approach to potential
environmental
and health risks. This means that the burden of proof for a
product's
long-term
safety falls on its producer. 
<P>
	According to the Rural Advancement Foundation International
(RAFI) in
Canada, the top five Gene Giants account for nearly two thirds of
the global
pesticide market, about a quarter of the commercial seed market,
and
virtually all the GM seed market. The five are AstaZeneca, DuPont,
Monsanto,
Novartis and Aventis. Monsanto alone controls nearly 90 percent of
the GM
seed market in the U.S., where farmers plant roughly half of their
corn,
cotton and soyfields with GM crops. 
<P>
	The biotech industry and many regulatory agencies argue that the
composition of GM food is not chemically different from
conventional ones
in ways that could jeopardise their safety or nutritional value.
Using this
concept of ''substantial equivalence'', they argue that GM foods
require no
special safety testing or labelling. 
<P>
	''This is being strongly resisted by us and other national
governments,''
says Edwards. 
<P>
	Some activist groups would prefer an outright ban on GM foods,
saying that
labelling would be meaningless for illiterate people, especially
in
developing countries. 
<P>
	Although its backers say GM foods are the answer to world hunger
and can
produce more nutritious food, critics feel otherwise. ''Are the
big gains
promised actually there?'' asks Mourin. With GM crops, Mourin
argues that
pesticide use will actually go up with disastrous impact for
consumers and
the environment. 
<P>
	Consumer groups are fighting back. In a David vs Goliath battle
in Brazil,
the 'Instituto de Defesa do Consumidor' (IDEC) and its allies,
using a
campaign slogan 'GM Foods: Don't Swallow that Stuff', stopped the
commercial planting of GM seeds in a country where 25 percent of
the world 's
soya is grown.  The federal court ruled in June 1999 that Monsanto
had to
present an environmental impact assessment before any GM soya
could be
planted and sold commercially. 
<P>
	Although some groups want a total ban on GM foods, most consumer
groups
recognise the strategic value of pressing for mandatory labelling.
''Labelling is the key issue,'' conceded a spokesperson for a
Monsanto
subsidiary to the press. ''If you put a label on genetically
engineered
food, you might as well put a skull and crossbones on it.''
