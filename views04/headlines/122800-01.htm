George W Bush's incoming administration is preparing for a more aggressive onslaught on guerrillas and drug traffickers in Colombia, a confidential speech by a senior adviser reveals.
<P>Robert Zoellick, who is to be appointed to an international policy post in the Republican administration - possibly chief trade representative - said: "If the Colombian people are willing to fight for their own country, then the US should offer serious, sustained and timely financial, material and intelligence support."</P>
<P>His speech, which was delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations a week before the November 7 presidential election, suggests a big shift in Washington's policy on Colombia, just as President Andres Pastrana appears to be on the verge of making peace with the country's second-biggest leftwing rebel force, the National Liberation Army (ELN).</P>
<P>The Clinton administration's tried to stay out of the 36-year civil war while giving multimillion-dollar aid packages intended for action against drugs.</P>
<P>Rightwing critics such as Mr Zoellick say that policy is soft on leftwing guerrilla movements such as the ELN and the larger Farc.</P>
<P>"We cannot continue to make a false distinction between counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics efforts," Mr Zoellick said. "The narco-traffickers and guerrillas compose one dangerous network."</P>
<P>Leftwing critics, on the other hand, say the Clinton policy gives the Colombian armed forces too much leeway to divert US aid to rightwing death squads waging a largely unchecked war against the guerrillas.</P>
<P>Death squads have carried out three-quarters of the 4,000 annual political killings.</P>
<P>One critic, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, said this week that the Clinton administration's refusal to attach human rights guarantees and conditions to Washington's latest $1.3bn (&#163;870m) aid package to Colombia "sent a terrible signal".</P>
<P>When the issue comes up for review next month, Mr Wellstone says, no aid should be given until all human rights terms are met.</P>
<P>But Mr Zoellick's tough speech suggests such that an effort is doomed.</P>
<P>It ignored human rights conditions, and called on the "forces of democracy" to combat "new threats to security" in Colombia.</P>
<P>Such a policy appears to align the new administration with the Colombian military and the death squads against Mr Pastrana and the left.</P>
<P>The prospect of a change in US policy could hardly come at a more delicate time in Colombia's long-running crisis, which has claimed more 
 than 35,000 lives in the past 10 years and creates 300,000 refugees each year.</P>
<P>Thousands of Colombians have also been kidnapped, by both sides.</P>
<P>Last weekend the ELN freed 42 police officers and soldiers, a Christmas gesture which appeared to crown Cuban-brokered talks between Bogota and the ELN aimed at establishing a demilitarised enclave run by the ELN in Bolivar region in the north.</P>
<P>If it is finally agreed, the land-for-peace deal with the 5,000-strong ELN will be similar to a pact two years ago between Mr Pastrana and the Farc.</P>
<P>That deal was criticised because of the continuing claim of human rights abuses by Farc and because the armed forces have never accepted the deal's legitimacy.</P>
<P>That has led Bogota to press for tougher terms in any agreement with the ELN. Residents of Bolivar are demanding such conditions, because they fear a demilitarised zone could lead to increased violence.</P>
<P>The land-for-peace deals with the guerrillas are intended to be a prelude to full-scale peace talks. The deal with Farc laid down two years of peace talks which have not so far led to any hoped-for agreement.</P>
<P>The Farc has until January 31 to return to talks or see the military allowed back into the demilitarised zone.</P>
<P>A deal with the ELN would involve promises by both sides to hold full peace negotiations within nine months, Mr Pastrana said this week.
