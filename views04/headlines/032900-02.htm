<p>In Ottawa, a star hockey player moved to Europe rather than play this season for his $3.6 million salary. Season-ticket holders for Ottawa Senators' games are suing him and his agent for breach of contract.
<P>
<P>When hockey fans on Long Island objected to the New York Islanders changing their traditional uniforms and decided that owners were bleeding the team dry, they began organizing. The old uniforms are back, and the old owners are long gone. But the fans' organization, Save the Islanders Coalition, or STICK, is still at it five years later, trying to use the county government as leverage to clear the way for the new, but still unpopular, owners to sell.
<P>
<P>From a headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., other fans are building a national organization, a veritable fans' union that makes valuable use of the Internet to assert its interests in the front offices of sports leagues and franchises.
<P>
<P>Amid a winter-sports season of deep discontent in Boston, local fans are flooding the talk-radio airwaves with invective. But other fans are discovering that they can do much more. Outraged by their marginalization in the modern sports industry and alienated by owners who enrich themselves at their expense, fans are organizing and fighting back.
<P>
<P>''These efforts are popping up all over the place,'' said David M. Carter, a professor of sports business at the University of Southern California. ''The talk-and-smack shows help blow off steam about Ray Bourque and Rick Pitino, and that's important, but these groups are finding a way to have their voices heard in a different way.
<P>
<P>''People feel they are getting priced out of the sports they want to watch,'' Carter said. ''They feel bitter about player transactions and how their teams are being managed.''
<P>
<P>The fans in Ottawa are certainly being heard - and in a court of law, where hearings can produce tangible results.
<P>
<P>At the beginning of the National Hockey League season, the flashy, popular captain of the Ottawa Senators, Alexei Yashin, walked away from the last year of his contract. His agent, Mark Gandler, a Russian expatriate with a reputation in the NHL for tough bargaining, had sought remuneration beyond the $3.6 million already negotiated for the fourth year of Yashin's deal. What has angered the traditionalist hockey fans of the Canadian capital all the more is that Yashin, 26, spent much of the winter luxuriating in Italy with his fashion model girlfriend, Carol Alt.
<P>
<P>What Yashin and Gandler failed to bargain for is fans finding a legal outlet for their outrage.
<P>
<P>''Four of us had just finished a round of golf at the Ottawa Hunt Club. We were all grandfathers, all with grandkids who play organized hockey,'' said Len Potechin, a prominent businessman and season-ticket holder. ''And it struck all of us that what Yashin is doing is not very pleasant, and it's a real black eye to kids that a star player can take his puck and go home.
<P>
<P>''By the end of the conversation, we had 20 people sitting at a table at the hunt club, and we all agreed that something must be done,'' said Potechin, the lead plaintiff in the case. ''From that conversation among four grandfathers, a group of about 400 of us now represent the 11,000 season-ticket holders in a class action.''
<P>
<P>Gandler has publicly denounced the case as frivolous. Yashin has argued in legal papers that his only responsibility is to himself. But the case continues to wind its way through court, defeating a third motion to dismiss last Thursday  and clearing other legal hurdles along the way. The trial is scheduled for May 5.
<P>
<P>''I don't want the money. I want him to play. I want him to admit he is wrong,'' Potechin said. ''I think that is the message the children ought to get out of this.
<P>
<P>''And we're making some headway. All of a sudden, somebody who said this was frivolous is faced with a major problem.''
<P>
<P>On Long Island, STICK has existed since 1995, and it is still fighting. Its leader, Steven Ellers, is a communications technician for Bell Atlantic and a former season-ticket holder.
<P>
<P>''One thing I am really proud of is growing up one block from the Nassau Coliseum, where the Islanders play, and watching them improve from an expansion franchise to a dynasty in the '80s,'' Ellers said. ''But what has happened out here over the past 10 years is a tragedy.''
<P>
<P>STICK, which includes 3,000 dues-paying members, has organized several demonstrations in front of the Coliseum with hundreds and even thousands of fans participating. It also leads an ongoing boycott of the Coliseum's parking lot, which produces revenue for the current owners, Howard and Edward Milstein and Steven Gluckstern.
<P>
<P>When the team abandoned part of its Stanley Cup-winning tradition and changed its uniform, STICK produced 400 protesters who helped persuade management to restore the old jerseys.
<P>
<P>When various owners refused to pay large salaries to re-sign stars and obtain new ones, more protesters showed up in the parking lot of the Coliseum to vent their rage. Within months, absentee owners sold the team.
<P>
<P>A protest in February over continuing ownership issues drew 2,000 people.
<P>
<P>''We just made the point that we don't like the way things are being done, here. Over the years, ownership has endangered the existence of this franchise,'' Ellers said. ''This is a fan-advocacy group that is an alternative to the single fan's voice.''
<P>
<P>With ownership controversies still swirling around the Islanders and the team locked into a lease on the Nassau Coliseum - acknowledged to be the worst arena in the NHL - through 2015, STICK has helped to force the Nassau County Legislature to hold public hearings, which began last Thursday. 
<P>
<P>''The lease is really preventing the sale of the team by making it unattractive to own the Islanders,'' Ellers said. ''We think that there is a better group of owners out there, willing to sink a lot more money back into the team, and it is important that the issues surrounding a county-owned stadium are being aired publicly.''
<P>
<P>Anyone who logs on to www.usfans.com will discover a nascent movement to organize sports fans nationally.
<P>
<P>''The number one thing fans could and should do is to mobilize themselves into a force and then to bring that force to bear, and that is one of the things we are about,'' said Arthur Bernstein, the vice president for advocacy and chapter development for the for-profit group, called United Sports Fans of America.
<P>
<P>The organization has 17 full-time employees and asserts that it has played a role in both liberalizing the National Football League's blackout policy for televised games and in furthering the dialogue between owners and players during the National Basketball Association lockout last season. 
<P>
<P>Officials of both the NFL and the NBA privately deny that United Sports Fans of America had any significant impact on either issue. But officials for both leagues were careful to say that the NFL and the NBA are always interested in listening to fans and organizations representing fans.
<P>
<P>''Right now, in addition to trying to organize local chapters, we are in the middle of trying to drum up support for parity and revenue sharing in baseball, so that Major League Baseball will become more competitive for all of the fans and the teams,'' Bernstein said. 
<P>
<P>The issue is currently being reviewed by a committee headed by George Mitchell, the former US senator, at the behest of baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, an advocate of measures to enforce parity among franchises in Major League Baseball.
<P>
<P>''When push eventually comes to shove, you know owners like George Steinbrenner are going to be tough to persuade because they are in an advantageous position under the current system,'' Bernstein said. ''But if we have  1 million fans saying we support the commissioner and something must be done, it is going to have an effect.''
<P>
<P>Similar organizations and efforts have been mounted elsewhere, and some observers like Carter see it as a trend that could produce major results. But Carter also advocates slightly different tactics.
<P>
<P>''Until the corporations that use sports as a marketing platform or as content for broadcast networks hear what these fans are saying, their impact will be more limited,'' Carter said. ''They need to inject themselves into the advertiser and sponsor process, to let those corporations know that their money is wasted because their message is being ignored by disenfranchised fans.''
<P>
<P>If that happens, and if the companies start taking that problem to team owners and league officials, Carter said, ''You would begin to see a lot of change.''
