            WASHINGTON - As countries blame each other for last week's collapse 
            of the global talks on climate change, environmental pressure groups 
            are calling on industrialised nations to quickly resume negotiations. 
            <P> While some progress was made to translate an international treaty 
              to reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gases into an enforceable agreement, 
              industrialised nations could not agree on how much credit should 
              be given for using forests and farmland to absorb carbon, the main 
              greenhouse gas. On Saturday in The Hague talks were suspended without 
              resolution. 
            <P> Environmentalists are now urging European and US negotiators to 
              talk frequently between now and the next negotiating session, scheduled 
              for May in Bonn, Germany. 
            <P> ''We hope that the ministers will reconvene, at least informally, 
              as quickly as possible to build on what progress was made in The 
              Hague,'' says Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental 
              Trust, a Washington-based advocacy group. 
            <P> The recent session in the Netherlands was intended to hammer out 
              the details of the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement which requires 
              industrialised countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse 
              gases by an average of five percent below 1990 levels by 2012. 
            <P> The United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, initially 
              sought to get halfway to its Kyoto target by getting credit for 
              its vast forests as a carbon dioxide ''sink''. 
            <P> After the European Union rejected this proposal, the United States 
              reduced the credits it wanted for forests and other so-called ''sinks'' 
              by nearly three-fourths. But Frank Loy, the leading US negotiator, 
              says he never received a response to why the deal fell apart. 
            <P> Some conservationists here, while agreeing with the EU's scepticism 
              about relying on sinks to halt climate change, are criticising the 
              European negotiators. Clapp with the National Environmental Trust 
              says they may have missed their best opportunity for a strong treaty. 
            <P> After January, Europe could face the administration headed by 
              Republican governor of Texas, George W. Bush, who is almost certain 
              to push for sinks and market-based mechanisms that environmentalists 
              call ''loopholes''. 
            <P> ''This was a critical window of opportunity,'' says Clapp. ''To 
              let it close was a monumental miscalculation.'' 
            <P> But with more time to negotiate, conservation groups remain optimistic 
              that an agreement is still attainable. 
            <P> ''With an extra day, I believe a package deal could have been 
              reached,'' says Alden Meyer, director of government relations for 
              the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
            <P> Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate change campaign for the 
              World Wildlife Fund, underscores the need for negotiators to meet 
              again soon before the next formal date in May. ''We all believe 
              they need to reconvene in weeks, not months,'' she says. 
            <P> Meyer adds that now, more than ever before, business is more willing 
              to act on reducing emissions. The shift of business is ''nothing 
              short of amazing'', says Meyers. 
            <P> When the Kyoto Protocol was first written up in 1997, powerful 
              US industries launched a multi-million dollar mass media campaign 
              against the agreement, arguing that it would devastate the US economy. 
              Since then, many corporations have changed their tune. Several companies, 
              including British Petroleum (BP)-Amoco, Shell International, and 
              the chemical company DuPont, have teamed with the advocacy group, 
              Environmental Defense, in setting firm targets for reducing their 
              own emissions. BP-Amoco has even set up its own internal carbon 
              emission trading programme. 
            <P> During The Hague conference, the National Environmental Trust 
              released a poll of Fortune 5000 companies that Clapp says illustrates 
              changing opinions on global warming and the Kyoto Protocol. 
            <P> Thirty-four percent of business executives polled said they support 
              ratification of the agreement by the US Senate. The poll, conducted 
              by American Viewpoint, a Republican polling firm based in Washington, 
              also found that 75 percent of Fortune 5000 executives believe that 
              global warming is a serious problem. 
            <P> ''This view accounts for some of the movement we have seen in 
              the business community in the past two years,'' says Clapp. 
            <P> Some business interests who went to The Hague expressed confusion 
              that the climate talks collapsed. ''We came here expecting a decision 
              which would have clarified rules and guidelines,'' Nick Campbell, 
              of the International Chambers of Commerce, told reporters. 
            <P> Besides a shift in the business community, the US Senate - once 
              unanimously opposed to its ratification - has also begun to change, 
              notes Clapp. Three outspoken opponents to the agreement were defeated 
              in the recent elections: Republicans Spencer Abraham of Michigan, 
              John Ashcroft of Missouri and Rod Grams of Minnesota.
