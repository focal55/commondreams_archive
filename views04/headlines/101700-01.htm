NUEVA LOJA, Ecuador - The military's fumigation of
coca
plantations in Colombia with the herbicide glyphosate, part of the
government's anti-drug trafficking fight, is causing environmental
damage
and health problems in neighbouring Ecuador's border provinces. 
<P>
Residents of General Farfán and Puerto el Carmen, villages in the
Ecuadorian
Amazon province of Sucumbíos, on the banks of the San Miguel
River, told IPS
that in the days after they heard airplanes fumigating in the
nearby
Colombian department of Putumayo, dozens of trees in their towns
began to
die. 
<P>
'The consequences are felt on this side of the border - many
trees dry up
and no one knows why, but it can be explained by the application
of some
herbicides, like those used in the Colombian fumigations,''
commented Tito
Piedra, resident of Puerto el Carmen. 
<P>
Bolívar Botina, mayor of Puerto Guzmán, on the Colombian side,
affirmed
Piedra's information and added that seven people in the area have
died from
intoxication caused by the extensive fumigation over the last four
months. 
<P>
'Last week they stopped fumigating, perhaps because of the
protests by the
people of Putumayo against Plan Colombia,' but we presume they
will be back
soon,'' said Botina. 
<P>
Plan Colombia, which took effect Sep 1, is President Andrés
Pastrana's
seven-billion-dollar initiative to fight drug trafficking and
production.
The United States has already assured 1.3 billion dollars for the
plan û
largely military aid -, Colombia is to provide 4.5 billion, and
Pastrana is
hoping Europe and Asia will put up the rest. 
<P>
But it was the fumigation efforts in an area of the Colombian
department of
Nariño, bordering Ecuador's mountainous province of Carchi, that
caused the
worst impacts on the Ecuadorian population. 
<P>
'Since August the air we breathe hasn't been the same and there
are
neighbours who have had sore eyes and headaches, which isn't
normal,'' said
Juan Cruz, a farmer from Tobar Donoso, a village in Carchi. 
<P>
Arturo Yepez, a doctor from Tulcán, capital of Carchi, said the
zone's
residents come to him with symptoms similar to peasants who have
been '
poisoned from ingesting pesticides.'' 
<P>
Peasant farmers from Tobar Donoso say there have been only low-
level
fumigations in recent weeks, but they fear renewed massive
efforts, like
those in late August intended to destroy 5,000 hectares of coca
fields on
the Colombian side of the border. 
<P>
At that time, Colombian anti-drug forces used three Turbo Thrush
crop-dusting airplanes, guarded by three Black Hawk helicopters
and 200
soldiers, trained and equipped by the United States. 
<P>
The director of the anti-drug police, Gen. Ismael Trujillo, said
that with
the destruction of the coca fields and of the processing
laboratories in
Nariño his force has prevented the production of approximately 29
tonnes of
cocaine destined for the US market. 
<P>
'While planes flew over the plantations, leaving a wake of
glyphosate in
the air, and the helicopters escorted them to prevent guerrilla
attacks, the
soldiers went into the forest to search for peasants who fled,'' a
coca
grower, who requested his name withheld, told IPS. 
<P>
On the Ecuadorian side, farmers reported that approximately six
hours after
the spraying they saw extensive areas of yucca, or manioc, with
burned
leaves. 
<P>
Glyphosate, one of Monsanto's most important chemical herbicides,
was
introduced in Latin America 25 years ago, marketed principally
under the
name Roundup with annual sales of 1.2 billion dollars. 
<P>
It is an herbicide classified as a Category III Toxin, which calls
for
caution in handling because it can cause gastro-intestinal
problems,
vomiting, enlargement of the lungs, pneumonia, mental confusion,
and
destruction of the red corpuscles in mucus membrane tissues. 
<P>
But the Ecuadorians also fear that in the eradication of coca, the
Colombian
military is using the transgenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum.' The
fungus is
an alternative Washington proposed to the Colombian government,
but has been
denounced by scientists and environmentalists around the world
because of
the dangers posed by its release into the environment. 
<P>
Lucía Gallardo, of the Acción Ecológica' organisation, conducted
research
on the potential environmental consequences of Plan Colombia in
Ecuador and
stresses that 'Fusarium oxysporum would threaten the biodiversity
of the
entire Amazon region.'' 
<P>
'It causes damage to various cultivated plants, leading to
different types
of diseases and wilting of the leaves, rotting fruit and even
killing the
plant. It can also cause illness in humans, especially in patients
with
depressed immune systems, with cancer or AIDS,'' she added. 
<P>
Gallardo also says the fungus has the ability to genetically
mutate and
scatter itself, killing other crops - it is an organism that
easily adapts
to its surroundings. 
<P>
'By introducing the fungus into an ecosystem as complex as the
Amazon, it
could attack important crops like manioc, a food on which the
indigenous
peoples of the Amazon basin depend, and it could spread to the
coast,
affecting coffee, citrus, banana and other plantations,'' the
researcher
pointed out. 
<P>
The Amazon could turn into a focal point of contamination, the
effects of
which could last many years as the fungus can live for 20 years
and is
disseminated by air, soil and water. 
<P>
Fusarium oxysporum is categorised in the draft of the Protocol to
the
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention as 'a biological agent
for war,''
that once released into the environment is impossible to withdraw,
such that
'its effects are unpredictable.'' 
<P>
'The fungus can spread without taking into account political
borders,
attacking other crops and the biodiversity of Ecuador, Brazil,
Peru and
Venezuela,'' argues Gallardo. 
<P>
Ecuador's Minister of Environment, Jorge Rendón, issued a decree
prohibiting
the use of Fusarium oxysporum in the country and denied that any
experiments
had been carried out within national borders. 
<P>
According to the New York Times, the Colombian Minister of
Environment, Juan
Myer, under pressure from the United States, agreed to test the
effectiveness of the herbicidal fungus in that country, but he
later refuted
the reports, saying Colombia would not allow experiments with the
fungus
there. 
<P>
The Ecuadorian population living along the border is also
concerned that
there might be a massive influx of Colombians, displaced by the
fumigations
and by the escalation of armed confrontations between the
guerrillas,
paramilitary groups and government forces. 
<P>
Anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 peasants from Putumayo could be
displaced and
seek refuge in Sucumbíos, according to official estimates. Massive
immigration would collapse the Ecuadorian province's
administrative
capacity. 
<P>
Several human rights organisations have reported that Colombian
right-wing
paramilitary groups are buying up farms in Sucumbíos, feeding
fears that
confrontations with Colombia's leftist guerrillas will further
spill over
into Ecuadorian territory. 
<P>
Experts believe that coca plantations could spring up in Ecuador,
as
occurred in the early 1990s when coca eradication plans in Peru
prompted the
expansion of coca fields in Colombia. 
<P>
'If that occurs, the indigenous peoples and peasants in those
regions could
be displaced, and the biodiversity and different ecosystems
threatened with
extinction,'' stated Gallardo. 
<P>
More than 20 communities and of the indigenous Kishwa peoples,
located along
the border, would be at risk, she said. 
<P>
Border authorities and non-governmental organisations have formed
the Amazon
Defence Front to monitor the consequences of Plan Colombia on the
region's
environment. 
<P>
'We will not allow them to contaminate our ecosystem, because
they have
already caused enough damage with their oil spills,'' said Máximo
Abad,
mayor of Nueva Loja, capital of Sucumbíos.
