<p>The pipeline would run 650 miles from Chad's Doba oil field to a planned tanker port on Cameroon's Atlantic coast, carrying crude through lush tropical rainforests and other terrain filled with black rhinos, elephants, antelope and gorillas.
<p>	To the World Bank and the governments of Chad and Cameroon, the pipeline and oil field will pump billions of dollars of cash into one of the poorest regions on Earth. <p>	To Exxon and other multinational companies, it could provide profits for them and 1 billion barrels of oil to an energy-starved world.<p>	And, to thousands of protesters expected here next month, it is yet another symbol of what's wrong with the new global economy.<p>	Building on the sometimes violent protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle last year, activists plan to disrupt the meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the U.S. capital.<p>	Local police, who have experience handling large demonstrations, say they are prepared, but they've gotten extra riot training and, by some accounts, stocking up on tear gas and rubber bullets.<p>	They also say they learned the lessons of the "Battle in Seattle," during which tens of thousands took to the streets, initially overwhelming local police. More than 500 were arrested and property damage was estimated at $2.5 million.<p>	"While we respect the First Amendment rights of demonstrators, we won't tolerate any illegal or disruptive behavior," said Lt. Dan Nichols of the U.S. Capitol Police, which along with the Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Park Police and other law enforcement organizations have formed a task force to prepare.<p>	Many of the same groups from Seattle protests are planning the Washington demonstrations, including Direct Action Network, whose spokesman, Nadine Bloch, calls Seattle "a coming-out party."<p>	While an estimated 40,000 union members marched through the streets of downtown Seattle, organized labor will be missing, for the most part, in Washington.<p>	The AFL-CIO is supporting the so-called Jubilee 2000 movement, which will stage a rally on the Mall April 9 calling for cancellation of billions of dollars in debt owned by the world's poorest countries. But the organization will stay on the sidelines a week later when protests directed at the World Bank and IMF are scheduled.<p>	It's not that organized labor isn't concerned, it's just that it has different priorities. AFL-CIO spokesman Naomi Walker said "our main push" is to defeat legislation to grant China permanent normal trade relations with the United States and clear China's admission to the WTO.<p>	No one knows what to expect in Washington when teach-ins and conferences climax with mass protests April 16 -17 during the World Bank-IMF meetings.<p>	Missing from the list of sponsors are anarchist groups that were blamed for Seattle violence. But that doesn't mean they won't show up.<p>	"These are meant to be peaceful, nonviolent demonstrations," Andrea Durbin of Friends of the Earth said of the Washington, D.C., protests. "But it has the potential to get ugly real quick."<p>	In targeting the World Bank and the IMF, demonstrators picked two organizations that operate in obscurity but have had a vast impact on the world since 1944, when the Allies formed them and the WTO's forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as World War II drew to an end.<p>	GATT established the rules for international trade. The IMF was to stabilize international currencies and to lend money to nations whose economies were in turmoil. The World Bank was to loan money to projects to lift nations out of poverty.<p>	During the recent economic crisis in Asia, the IMF provided loans to a handful of countries while imposing austerity measures to bring their economic houses in order. But critics say those steps strain the social safety net for the poor in those countries.<p>	The World Bank loans more than $30 billion a year, with an emphasis on basic health, education, the environment and encouraging private business. But critics say its loans prop up corrupt governments and benefit banks, rich investors and private corporations more than poor people.<p>	"The record of the IMF and World Bank is one of unmitigated failure," said Njoki Njoroge Njehu, director of the 50 Years Is Enough Network, a sponsor of the upcoming demonstrations. "It is time to shrink these institutions."<p>	The Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline is a perfect example of risky World Bank programs, critics say.<p>	The bank, after five years' study, is on the brink of providing more than $365 million in loans and guarantees for the project. <p>	Opponents say the money will go to two corrupt governments and some of the world's largest oil companies, and there are no guarantees it will trickle down to the poor. They also say it could be an environmental disaster.<p>	Bank officials concede that it is a controversial project but add that, after countless environmental reviews and feasibility studies, it more than meets the standard for loan support.<p>	"What gives the (opponents) the right to block industrial development in these countries and keep them in utter poverty?" said Merrell Tuck, a spokeswoman for the bank. The past five years, Tuck said, the bank has worked to improve its environmental record and to ensure its loans help the poor
<p>Tuck added, however, "In the wake of Seattle, we aren't terribly surprised there will be protests in Washington. Part of it is a globalization backlash, an elemental fear of the future. Those are very potent issues."
