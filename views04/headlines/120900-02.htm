SACRAMENTO, Calif.  - Hoping to ease the state's electricity
crisis, air-quality regulators Friday allowed the restart of
several power plants in southern California that had been shut down
because they had reached air pollution limits.
<p>Later Friday, federal energy regulators lifted price caps on
wholesale California electricity following an emergency request
from the managers of the strapped power grid.
<p>The operators said lifting the caps would give California
greater access to electricity supplies at a time when the power
grid is stressed to capacity.
<p>Gov. Gray Davis suggested the decision would spark new rounds of
price increases and demanded a congressional investigation.
<p>The ruling was ``an outrageous assault on the consumers and
businesses of California by a federal agency answerable to no
one,'' Davis said.
<p>The Folsom-based California Independent System Operator, which
manages the state's power grid, said lifting the price caps was
justified because it has ``become increasingly difficult to manage
these (power) negotiations while at the same time balancing supply
and demand.''
<p>The moves came a day after California encountered an
unprecedented power crunch, with electricity supplies for the
state's 34 million people so perilously low that California only
narrowly avoided blackouts.
<p>The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the
Northwest, the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or
other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in
California.
<p>On Thursday, during the emergency, power plants capable of
producing 2,400 megawatts were off-line because they had exceeded
their pollution limits. One megawatt is sufficient to power about
1,000 homes.
<p>On Friday, the South Coast Air Quality Management District
agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to
operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity.
However, those plants will have to pay daily fines.
<p>``This is an attempt to balance the obvious and immediate need
for power generation with protecting the environment and public
health here in the South Coast Basin,'' said district spokesman Sam
Atwood.
<p>Restarting the over-polluting plants should provide a cushion
for the state, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the ISO.
<p>In addition, hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption
Friday to avoid imposed outages.
<p>``We're still encouraging conservation efforts,'' said Lori
O'Donley, spokeswoman for the ISO. ``We're optimistic that we won't
have to'' impose shutdowns on commercial customers.
<p>Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find
power that can be diverted to California during the crunch, moves
that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of
state.
<p>The power grid's managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday
by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push
water from Northern California to central and southern regions.
<p>The phased-in deregulation of California's $20 billion
electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating
greater competition. But demand for electricity has outstripped
supply, in part because of a growing population and a booming
high-tech economy.
<p>Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies
held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the
planning stages. In addition, deregulation has forced utilities to
sell off their power-generating assets, such as dams and plants,
and import electricity from neighboring states, where power demand
is high right now because of a cold snap.
