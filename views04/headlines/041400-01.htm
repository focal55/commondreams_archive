There  they sat, more than 70 young people in a Boston University classroom with space for half their number: quiet, attentive, intent on learning how to get arrested this weekend.

</table>They jumped up and did role playing to probe how to deal with anger in themselves and others when they protest against the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. They sat again - on the cold stone floor to simulate the cramped discomfort of a holding cell - and talked, and talked, and talked. About Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, about what it means to be nonviolent. 
<P>
<P>The lesson was sophisticated, three hours long, and just one in a series of preparations - ranging from teach-ins at Harvard and BU to street theater - organized for Bostonians heading for the World Bank-IMF demonstrations in Washington. As of yesterday, 11 busloads from the Amherst area - eight from greater Boston, and one from Worcester - were scheduled to leave, starting this morning, for the protests.
<P>
<P>At the Wednesday night session, Jessica Shubow, 40, of Dorchester, a longtime activist and trainer of demonstrators, asked the group, ''what is nonviolent?'' and encouraged them as they shouted one by one: ''Love!''
<P>
<P>''Gandhi!''
<P>
<P>''Children!''
<P>
<P>''Calmness!''
<P>
<P>''Peace!''
<P>
<P>She shot them a knowing look: ''Surely, everyone doesn't think nonviolence is that positive.''
<P>
<P>Different responses came back:
<P>
<P>''Weak.''
<P>
<P>''Passive.''
<P>
<P>''Boring.''
<P>
<P>''Ineffective.''
<P>
<P>The goal of the exercise, Shubow said later, was to help a new generation of activists get past conventional thinking that says force is power and nonviolence is weakness.
<P>
<P>''Just because someone tells you what the rules are doesn't mean those are the rules you are going to play by,'' Shubow told them. ''It has something to do with your consent. You won't believe how much power you get from withholding that consent.''
<P>
<P>For Shubow and other veteran activists, the swelling student interest in the movement against institutions of globalization - which the activists see as agents of wealthy, corporate, undemocratic interests - is an exhilarating revival of politics born in opposition to the Vietnam War and refined in battles during the 1980s against nuclear power and US policy in Central America.
<P>
<P>Roni Krouzman, a 1999 graduate of BU and organizer of the citywide Campus Action Network, which is arranging teach-ins in the Boston area, said the issue of control is at the heart of present-day students' interests.
<P>
<P>''This is what the IMF and the living-wage campaign at Harvard have in common. It's all about who is in control,'' said Krouzman, 22.
<P>
<P>''It has appeal to students because, generally, they have not been in control all their lives. It is about helping other people, but more than that it's about empowering yourself, gaining a voice for yourself and power for yourself.''
<P>
<P>In addition, said Sarah Carrier, who is also 22 and lives in an apartment in Jamaica Plain, ''the sentiment is maybe that our parents' generation sold out, and maybe our generation, Generation X, has learned from their mistakes. People are thinking about big pictures, thinking less simplistically.''
<P>
<P>Carrier's partner, Denis Moynihan, 34, said resentment of corporate arrogance extends from international agribusiness to consumer goods.
<P>
<P>''It irritates younger activists that rebellion has been commodified and associated with product lines'' like Tommy Hilfiger and Mercedes-Benz, Moynihan said.
<P>
<P>''They are using images of the '60s to sell investments and luxury cars. It is a complete perversion.''
<P>
<P>Many of the tactics that have succeeded in fitting so many attitudes and types of people under the umbrella of the anti-globalization movement, and that pulled off the dramatic disruption of the World Trade Organization meeting in December in Seattle, grew out of methods developed in the Clamshell Alliance effort against the Seabrook nuclear-power plant in the 1970s.
<P>
<P>Activists are organized into groups of eight to 20 members and trained in the politics of consensus. This concept was what Shubow was teaching the students Wednesday night.
<P>
<P>''It is very decentralized decision-making,'' said Michael Prokosch, whose first arrest was in 1969 when he joined the Students for a Democratic Society in its watershed occupation of Harvard's University Hall.
<P>
<P>He now works for the labor-backed organization United for a Fair Economy.
<P>
<P>''The affinity groups make their own decisions -  when to stand, when to run, whether there is so much force in front of them that they want to withdraw, whether they want to get arrested,'' Prokosch said.
<P>
<P>''With the new movement, it is even more decentralized'' than during the Seabrook protests, he added.
<P>
<P>In the Seattle protests, a 25-square-block area around the convention center was parceled out to 13 clusters of groups that made plans for blocking the WTO meeting - plans that they did not share with one another. 
<P>
<P>''This made it very difficult to infiltrate, and the Seattle police did not think they were able to plan or coordinate anything,'' Prokosch said. ''Which is a reason they were so ineffective.
<P>
<P>''There is a whole ideology of direct democracy being acted out here,'' he said. The protesters in Seattle, and now again in Washington, organize a direct-democracy structure for a specific action, and ''that government doesn't last longer than the mission for which it was created.''
