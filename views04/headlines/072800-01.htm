Despite 
a policy prohibiting military involvement in partisan politics, congressmen and guests at the Republican 
National Convention will have an exclusive viewing of some of the Pentagon's latest hardware, including an 
aircraft that the expected Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick 
Cheney, tried to kill when he was 
secretary of defense.

<p> Seizing what a spokesman today 
called "a convenient opportunity" to 
display some of its latest equipment, 
the Pentagon asked the armed services to ship -- at taxpayer expense -- 
weapons and other equipment to the 
former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 
for what amounts to a three-day military trade show, beginning Saturday.

<p> Secretary of Defense William S. 
Cohen, the only Republican in President Clinton's cabinet, approved the 
display after receiving a written request earlier this month from Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican 
from suburban Philadelphia and senior member of the House Armed 
Services Committee.

<p> Mr. Cohen did so, officials said, 
only after the Pentagon was assured 
that the hardware -- and more than 
150 service members accompanying 
it -- would not be used for any political activities.

<p> To emphasize the point, the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, John K. Veroneau, sent 
Mr. Weldon a letter outlining certain 
conditions: in short, no photo opportunities.

<p> Even so, the display will be a centerpiece of a series of events organized by Mr. Weldon for about 100 
Republican colleagues and their 
families, who will be staying in old 
Navy billets at the shipyard during 
the convention at the First Union 
Center, less than a mile away. Included in the festivities, closed to the 
public, will be a "block party" fund-raiser by Mr. Weldon on Monday.

<p> "This whole thing is awkward," 
said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, 
a nonprofit group in Washington. 
"All this sexy, multibillion-dollar 
hardware there to impress delegates 
is very smarmy and probably inappropriate. If there isn't a rule 
against this, it seems to me there 
ought to be."

<p> The Pentagon's role has even 
raised hackles among some military 
officers, who complained that, at 
best, it blurs the definition of what 
constitutes political activity. "To say 
this is not a partisan event is borderline absurd," one officer said.

<p> Others at the Pentagon complained that the cost would have to 
come out of their own budgets, at a 
time they face spot shortages of 
money for readiness.

<p> Despite those misgivings, some of 
the services now appear to regard 
the display as a chance to do a little 
lobbying of their own. "There's not a 
lot of enthusiasm for this," another 
official said, "but if they're ordered 
to do it, they want to look good."

<p> Among the aircraft to be displayed 
is the V-22 Osprey, which has 
crashed three times in the past decade. It is a hybrid with rotors that 
swivel so it can take off like a helicopter but cruise like a turboprop 
commuter plane. The Osprey has 
been beset by controversy over cost 
and mission as well as safety, and 
Mr. Cheney  waged a long and unsuccessful battle against it when he was 
in the Bush administration.

<p>  In addition to the V-22, the Marines 
are sending an amphibious vehicle 
and equipment for its chemical- and 
biological-attack response teams. 
The Air Force plans to include an 
unmanned surveillance aircraft 
called the Predator, as well as missiles and bombs and story boards 
promoting its newest fighter, the F-22. 

<p> The Army, not to be outdone, has 
mobilized a virtual armory of equipment, including an Apache attack 
helicopter, its own unmanned aircraft and its troubled theater missile 
defense system.

<p> The Pennsylvania National Guard 
is contributing an M1-A1 tank, an 
armored personnel carrier and two 
more helicopters.

<p> By contrast, the Navy is sending 
only an aging Sea Sprite helicopter 
from a nearby reserve unit, two surveillance vehicles and a small riverine boat. 

<p> Pentagon officials said today that 
it was too soon to put a cost on 
moving all the equipment to Philadelphia, though the Air Force estimated that its share would be at 
least $100,000.

<p> The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, spent much of a news 
conference today defending the display. Mr. Bacon said that the events 
at the shipyard were an opportunity 
to provide what amounted to a briefing to lawmakers -- without mentioning lobbyists and other influential Republicans who might happen 
by -- but maintained that the display 
was not itself partisan. 

<p> "It is something that's contemporaneous with the Republican National Convention," he said. "It's not 
adjacent -- it's not right on the 
grounds where the convention is being held. It's nearby, but not on the 
grounds."

<p> Mr. Bacon also noted that Representative  Robert A. Brady, a Democrat whose district includes the shipyard, supported the request, though 
he did not sign Mr. Weldon's request 
to Secretary Cohen.

<p> Mr. Weldon's spokesman, Pete Peterson, said the congressman saw 
the shipyard, which is in the process 
of being closed and turned over for 
private development, as a convenient and secure location for his colleagues during the convention. Mr. 
Weldon, he said, was also eager to 
promote the shipyard's activities. 

<p> So is Richard A. Goldbach, the 
chairman and chief executive of 
Metro Machines, one of the largest 
military contractors at the shipyard. 
His company is erecting a tent to 
highlight its work, which includes 
ship rebuilding and demolition.

<p>  "It's pure and simple a promotion," Mr. Goldbach said.

<p> So far, there has been no word 
from the Democrats, though Pentagon officials they would certainly 
approve a similar request.
