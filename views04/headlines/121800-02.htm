WALTHAM, Mass. <wbr>-- <wbr>In a season that finds many Americans swimming in holiday excess,
food banks around the country have reported record requests for
assistance. Much of the demand for food comes from people with jobs, and
most from families with children.
<p>So loud was the cry for Thanksgiving meals that some shelters ran out
of turkeys to give away.
<p>"It was incredible," said Nancy Carrington of the Connecticut Food
Bank. Her group distributed 21,000 birds--up from 17,000 the previous
Thanksgiving--and Carrington said Christmas portends a repeat
performance. "Unfortunately," she said, "in the last five years, the
demand for food has been going up every single year."
<p>In Los Angeles, requests for emergency food assistance have increased
22% in the last year. "Our charities tell us it's mostly the increase in
the working poor, people working two or three jobs and yet they still
don't have enough to pay rent and food," said Daren Hoffman, spokesman at
the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.
<p>Amid the nation's unprecedented prosperity, an estimated 31 million
Americans live in households that suffer from hunger.
<p>The problem earns modest public attention during the holidays, when
coins drop freely into charity kettles, said J. Larry Brown, head of the
Center on Hunger and Poverty at Brandeis University here. But he said
hunger looms year-round as a hidden crisis that vexes experts.
<p>Brown has launched a coalition of academics and celebrities intent on
halting hunger in this country in the next five years. "The need for food
in the holidays is a sentinel indicator of need the rest of the time--and
one that's not diminishing when it ought to be," he said.
<p>"In terms of the lives of the poor and the hungry, there's no evidence
that the holiday season is a unique time. Poor people have an odd habit
of getting hungry the next day."
<p>Data released last week by the U.S. Conference of Mayors show that
most people seeking food assistance are employed. Brown's research
indicates that from 1998 to 1999, requests for emergency food aid
increased an average of 18% nationwide--with nearly 60% coming from
families with children.
<p>Federal free breakfast programs reach only 41% of eligible low-income
children, Brown said. Only 22% of eligible kids take part in the federal
summer food program.
<p>Typically, said Brown, about 68% to 72% of eligible families receive
food stamps. But with welfare reform changes, that figure has dropped to
about 60%. The number of poor children whose families receive food stamps
fell from 94% in 1994 to 75% in 1998, he said.
<p>The numbers became achingly real this year as food banks sought to
provide Thanksgiving turkeys for needy clients. Carrington, at the
Connecticut Food Bank, said she calculated that the increased number of
turkeys this year meant her facility was feeding 24,000 more people than
the year before.
<p>"When things are booming--when builders in this area can't keep up
with orders for big new houses--that's a scary thing to contemplate," she
said.
<p>At one Arizona food bank, 60% of requests for Thanksgiving turkeys
came from families where at least one parent was employed. Sandy
Schimmel, director of community relations for St. Mary's Food Bank in
Phoenix, said the demand for emergency food boxes in November soared to
9,000--up from 5,000 the year before.
<p>Contrary to the perception that hunger is predominantly a problem of
the homeless, Schimmel said only about 5% of her clientele are homeless.
And, she said, in a local economy where many people have low-paying jobs
in the service industry, food often becomes a family's luxury item.
<p>"These are people who are hard-working. They pay the rent. They pay
their light bill. They make their car payment," Schimmel said. "But then
they get a flat tire, and it becomes, do I change my tire or do I buy
food for my family?"
<p>At the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Hoffman said that as holiday
demand has increased, a dearth of donations has tightened supplies. "Last
year at this time, we had 2.6 million pounds of inventory. Today [we]
have just under 1 million pounds," he said. "It's almost a 58% reduction.
We're just kind of in this big valley."
<p>Hoffman said the food bank increased the number of children's programs
it assists from 15 in 1999 to 29 this year. In the last 10 months, the
agency has added a total of 60 organizations, bringing the total number
of people they serve from 270,000 to more than 300,000 in Los Angeles
County.
<p>In terms of elementary hunger economics, said Brown--who recently
assessed 50 current studies on hunger--"the short version is that over
the last decade, real wages for entry-level workers have fallen by almost
8% for men and around 6% for women."
<p>The average after-tax income of the middle fifth of the population has
grown by 8% over the last several years. But the bottom fifth has
declined by 10% over the same period, Brown said.
<p>Changes in welfare policy also mean that fewer families than ever get
food stamps, Brown and other experts said, noting that the hunger issue
also is propelled by a minimum wage that since 1970 has not kept pace
with inflation. These factors merge, Brown said, to produce "the strange
situation where we have a strong economy, low unemployment and yet hunger
is almost impervious."
<p>The seeming intractability of the hunger question prompted Brown to
form a nonprofit effort known as Hunger Free America. With a three-year
budget of $3 million, the fledgling project bridges Brown's academic
expertise with the star power of the Hollywood End Hunger Network and the
Entertainment Industry Foundation.
<p>The group has enlisted 50 celebrity volunteers, one for each state,
including Robin Williams, Pierce Brosnan and Quincy Jones. Jeff Bridges
has signed on to head the Hollywood effort beginning next month. "The
celebrities will be used in many ways, not so much only for TV
commercials, but, really to talk about the problem of hunger," Bridges
said Friday. Some stars, he said, will teach a public school program on
hunger.
<p>Hunger Free America (<a href="http://www.hungerfreeamerica.org">http://www.hungerfreeamerica.org</a>) also has taped
a series of public service TV announcements, with narrators ranging from
President Clinton to a 9-year-old girl who offers firsthand advice on
coping with hunger.
<p>"When you come home and there's nothing to eat," the rail-thin child
says, "try eating ice chips. Even though they won't give you energy and
stuff like that, they'll trick your stomach into thinking you've eaten
something."
<p>Using public battles against AIDS and breast cancer as models, retired
Santa Monica businessman Monty Factor said the group's aim is to raise
awareness about hunger.
<p>"What our goal has been and still is, is to allow Americans to see the
actual truth about the issue of hunger, and the fact that we are not the
leading country in the world, feeding people," said Factor, who for 20
years has worked with the End Hunger Network in Los Angeles.
<p>"In terms of childhood hunger, we're the last, actually, among all the
industrialized nations," he said.
