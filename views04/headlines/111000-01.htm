WASHINGTON  - Even as more than 160 nations prepare to  
gather in 
The Hague to hammer out the final details of the international  
treaty to 
reduce 
heat-trapping greenhouse gases, the convention is facing a  
political quagmire 
which could prevent its successful implementation worldwide.
<P>
At issue are ''flexible market mechanisms'' such as emission  
permit trading 
and 
getting credit for planting trees, which absorb the greenhouse gas  
carbon 
dioxide. Most environmentalists view these proposals as loopholes  
that would 
enable countries to get credit for meeting most of their target  
reductions for 
actions that would have happened anyway. 
<P>
Unless countries resolve their differences and make a strong  
commitment to 
reduce their emissions in The Netherlands, Nov. 13-25, scientists  
say the 
consequences could be disastrous. Most climate experts believe  
that global 
warming is caused by mostly carbon-based gases emitted when fossil  
fuels, like 
oil, gas and coal are burned. 
<P>
Already these gases have been blamed for heating the deep oceans,  
fracturing 
Antarctic ice shelves and fuelling more intense El Ninos. Severe  
storms in 
Britain and France last week are the latest weather disruptions  
that are being 
viewed as an early taste of global warming. 
<P>
According to an upcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on  
Climate 
Change, which was leaked to the press, the international committee  
of climate 
experts is expected to say that it is likely that greenhouse gases  
have 
''contributed substantially to the observed warming over the last  
50 years''. 
<P>
To deal with the threats of climate change, industrialised nations -  
despite 
strong opposition from powerful oil, coal and gas industries  
fearing for their 
bottom-line - negotiated an international agreement in 1997, known  
as the 
Kyoto 
Protocol. Named after the Japanese city where it was drawn up, the  
treaty 
requires that industrialised countries reduce their emission by an  
average of 
five percent below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012. 
<P>
The Protocol requires the ratification of at least 55 of the  
countries that 
signed the Convention, including the industrialised countries of  
the 
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  
which in 1990, 
accounted for more than half of carbon dioxide emissions, one of  
the main 
greenhouse gases. 
<P>
Yet the agreement has yet to be ratified by most of its  
signatories. Since its 
inception, the treaty has been plagued by political resistance  
from the United 
States, by far the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. 
<P>
While the administration of US President Bill Clinton signed the  
treaty, 
the US 
Senate refuses to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and has put language  
into 
appropriations bills that forbids the government from spending  
money to comply 
with the Kyoto Protocol. 
<P>
But most of the developing economies of Latin America, Asia and  
Africa argue 
that the wealthy industrialised nations should make the first move  
toward 
reducing emissions since they are responsible for the bulk of the  
emissions 
already in the atmosphere. 
<P>
The contentious issues left to be hammered out in The Hague  
revolve around the 
treaty's so-called market-based ''flexible mechanisms'' such as  
how emissions 
trading will work and whether there should be a limit to the  
extent this 
can be 
used to account for a country's Kyoto target. 
<P>
While the European Union believes there should be a limit to how  
much market 
mechanisms can be used, the US administration argues that it  
should be able to 
use flexible mechanisms to meet all of its reductions. 
<P>
Fourteen Latin American countries recently announced that they  
would back the 
US bid for emissions trading which would allow the United States  
to count the 
reduction of emissions in poorer countries and the use of carbon  
sinks - the 
planting or saving of forests - as part of its own quota under the  
Kyoto 
Protocol. 
<P>
Here in Washington this week, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the  
National 
Environmental Trust, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and  
the Union of 
Concerned Scientists (UCS) released a report saying that these  
mechanisms will 
amount to nothing but loopholes that will allow business to  
continue as usual. 
<P>
Environmentalists argue that international carbon trading - either  
between 
industrialised nations or between industrial and developing  
nations - cannot 
work since carbon is emitted from millions of sources all over the  
world and 
would be impossible to monitor. 
<P>
''Accounting gimmicks may fool bureaucrats, but they will not fool  
Mother 
Nature,'' says Alden Meyer, director of government relations at  
the UCS. ''The 
climate treaty must make real cuts of real pollution or the severe  
storms and 
other impacts that we are already starting to see will only get  
worse..' 
<P>
Further complicating the situation is the variation in emissions  
trends since 
the 1990 base year.  
<P>
Owing to economic collapse, Russia's 1995 emissions were 29  
percent below 1990 
levels, and Ukraine's 1997 emissions were down by 49 percent.  
Meanwhile, in 
1997 the European Union's emissions were only four percent below  
1990 
emissions 
while US emissions were 11 percent above 1990 levels. 
<P>
Because of these discrepancies, countries such as Russia and  
Ukraine under the 
Protocol have been granted carbon emission credits potentially  
worth billions 
of dollars annually. This then would allow the United States and  
other major 
emitters to meet most of their reduction commitment by purchasing  
credits from 
this region for reductions that have already taken place. 
<P>
''Trading of 'hot-air' would undermine the legitimacy of this  
(emission 
trading) system, making it more an arena for political horse- 
trading than a 
market mechanism,'' argues Hillary French, vice president of  
research at the 
Worldwatch Institute in Washington. 
<P>
In The Hague, countries will also debate how to harness the  
ability of forests 
to absorb 'greenhouse' gases. The United States, Japan, Canada and  
Australia 
are pushing for the inclusion of emission credits for tree  
plantations. 
<P>
But a report by Greenpeace and WWF released here this week says  
that rules to 
allow the use of forest plantations to store carbon pollution from  
the 
atmosphere could actually accelerate the destruction of old-growth  
or ancient 
native forests around the world. 
<P>
The environmental groups document how Tokyo Electric Power Company  
(TEPCO), 
Japan's largest power utility, has been implicated in the  
destruction of 
old-growth forest in the Australian state of Tasmania.  
<P>
According to the report, the company cut down native forest and  
replaced it 
with fast-growing eucalyptus plantations intended for 130,000 tons  
of credits 
that could be offset against rising carbon emissions in Japan. 
<P>
''We could see native forest destruction accelerate but still see  
no benefit 
for the global climate if Japan, Australia, Canada and the United  
States get 
their way,'' says Jennifer Morgan, director of WWF's climate  
change campaign. 
<P>
Environmentalists are also worried about that another of the  
flexible 
mechanisms under Kyoto called the Clean Development Mechanism  
(CDM) which will 
permit industrial nations to buy inexpensive reductions in  
developing 
countries. 
<P>
A typical CDM plan might involve selling China technology to make  
its coal 
cleaner, or a US coal-burning utility could pay to expand or  
preserve 
carbon-absorbing forests in Costa Rica. 
<P>
Ross Gelbspan, a long-time US-based author on climate change  
issues, says the 
CDM plan is inequitable since it would allow industrial nations to  
buy 
limitless amounts of cheap emission reductions in poor countries  
and to bank 
them indefinitely into the future. 
<P>
This would mean that when developing nations eventually become  
obligated to 
cut 
their own emissions, they will be left with only the most  
expensive options, 
says Gelbspan. 
<P>
''This clearly constitutes a form of environmental colonialism,''  
he says. 
<P>
In early October, more than 130 environmental organisations also  
criticised 
the 
US proposal for the CDM plan that would allow nuclear power plants  
to receive 
emission credits. 
<P>
Groups, including Public Citizen, Greenpeace and Friends of the  
Earth, say the 
US stance amounts to the transfer of a harmful outdated technology  
to Asia, 
Latin America and Africa. 
<P>
''Western nuclear companies, unable to get contracts at home due  
to safety, 
environmental and cost concerns, would be attempting to dump their  
unwanted 
and 
failing technology on developing countries,'' says a letter the  
organisations 
sent to Clinton.
