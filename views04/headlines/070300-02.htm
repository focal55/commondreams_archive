TORONTO --    With knotted rainbow kerchiefs and maple leaf flag 
patches on their khaki uniforms, members of Scouts Canada's Rover Crew 129 
stepped smartly down the route of this city's annual Gay Pride Parade last 
week, drawing cheers from many of the 800,000 people here for the world's 
first official gay and lesbian scout troop.	 

<P>  ``It's our perspective that sexual orientation has no bearing on the 
ability of a person to participate in or deliver our programs,'' said Andy 
McLaughlin, spokesman for Scouts Canada, the organization that authorized 
the gay troop's investiture two weeks ago. He compared the new unit to other 
specialized troops in Canada, such as those for Mormons or 
Cantonese-speakers.

</font></font></font>In contrast, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the Boy Scouts 
of America has a right to exclude gays from its ranks because opposition to 
homosexuality is part of the organization's ``expressive message.'' In the 
American Scouts pledge, boys promise to be ``morally straight.''	 

<P>  But as the new gay and lesbian troop here indicates, the United States 
shares North America with a country that is one of the world's most tolerant 
regarding homosexuality.	 
</P>
<P>  On Friday, a bill became law in Canada that erases virtually all legal 
distinctions between heterosexual marriages and same-sex unions.	 
</P>
<P>  Changing 68 federal statutes, the new law guarantees equality in areas 
that include income tax filing, bankruptcy protection, alimony, pension and 
veterans benefits for widowed spouses, and prison conjugal visits.	 
</P>
<P>  The bill does this by rewriting the legal definition of ``common law 
marriage'' to include same-sex and heterosexual couples who have lived 
together for more than one year. A separate bill, expected to be passed this 
fall, would extend immigration privileges to same-sex couples and their 
dependents.	 
</P>
<P>  In a concession to conservatives, the new omnibus law defines marriage as 
``the lawful union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others.''	 
</P>
<P>  But today in Canada, the only remaining privileges of marriage appear to 
be the ability to change family names and to get divorced.	 
</P>
<P>  ``This legislation is about tolerance and fairness,'' Justice Minister 
Anne McLellan said when she introduced the bill.	
</P>
<P>  The new laws came after five years of court decisions largely based on a 
clause banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation that is in 
Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.	 
</P>
<P>  Conservative provincial governments, such as Ontario's, have complied 
with these court decisions, erasing virtually all legal distinctions between 
same-sex common law unions and heterosexual marriages.	 
</P>
<P>  According to Scouts Canada and to members of the gay troop, there have 
been few complaints about the new unit. Scouts Canada, which has about 
150,000 members, said it encountered greater negative reaction two years ago 
when it admitted women. The only direct link between the American and 
Canadian groups is their membership in the World Organization of the Scout 
Movement, an umbrella group.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It's a bunch of people getting together to have fun. It's a great way 
to meet new people,'' said Bonte Minnema, a 24-year-old University of 
Toronto women's studies student who leads the Rovers group, which is 
composed of a dozen men and women, ages 18 to 26.	
<P>Other members of the troop, or crew, recalled that when they were teen-agers their scouting units ostracized them for being gay. "After I had been out for a while, I started to feel uncomfortable in Scouting," said Sara Evans, a 20-year-old video documentary maker. 

<P>Her partner, Elaina Evans, agreed, saying she spent 10 years in the Girl Guides movement. "When I was 16 and just coming out, I had some severe homophobic experiences in Guiding," she said. 

<P>The couple have a four-year-old daughter whom they want to start this fall in Scouts Canada's youngest program, Beavers. 

<P>Enthusiastic about Scouts Canada's plans to authorize a Beavers group, known as a "colony," for children of gay parents, Elaina Evans added: "It's important for her to be in contact with other kids who have gay and lesbian parents."
