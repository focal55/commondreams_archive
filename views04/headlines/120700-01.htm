SAVAR, Bangladesh, Dec 7  - The World Bank and its market-
driven health policies are getting the ire of health activists and
experts here, who say the Bank's cures are harming the developing-
country patients they seek to help. 
<P>
   Criticism of the bank and health priorities driven by the
market peaked has been a key theme of the ongoing People's Health
Assembly (PHA) here, but peaked during a stormy face-off
Wednesday. 
<P>
   At that session between the World Bank and health activists,
Bank representative Richard Lee Skolnik was treated to the display
of a giant cloth montage with brightly embroidered newspaper
headlines, which told stories of the harmful effects of the Bank's
structural adjustment programme (SAP) in Zimbabwe. 
<P>
   The headlines spoke of rising food prices, increasing crime,
and labour retrenchment. 
<P>
   These, presenter Mary Sandari said, are the direct result of
the country's acceding to SAP to pay back its debts as directed by
the bank. 
<P>
   Skolnik responded by saying the Bank only asked Zimbabwe to
manage its economy soundly and did not tell it to cut funding to
the social sectors. 
<P>
   Sandasi's presentation was followed by another by Hugo Icu, a
doctor from Guatemala who outlined the collapse of primary health
care in his country as a direct consequence of his government's
following the Bank's prescriptions. 
<P>
   Skolnik said the World Bank's health policies were helping poor
countries like India fight leprosy, polio, tuberculosis and
HIV/AIDS. 
<P>
   But at this remark, angry delegates to the health assembly
shouted ''get out''  and chanted ''no, no,'' until PHA project
coordinator Zafarullah Choudhury threatened to call off the week-
long PHA which ends Friday. 
<P>
   Skolnik was not allowed to finish his presentation, but instead
heard activists telling the Bank about the need to  restore the
primary health care approach promoted since the 1978 ''Health for
all Declaration'' at an global meeting at Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. 
<P>
   Critics say the global pledge set at that meeting -- which
included primary health care for all by 2000 -- have now all but
been scuttled by the Bank's approach which deprives developing-
country budgets of funds for social sectors. 
<P>
   ''We don't want charity but justice,'' said Charles Mutasa, a
panelist from Zimbabwe, adding that the Bank's approach has driven
many African countries into a debt trap as a result of the new
global economic system.  
<P>
   Mutasa spoke of ''exogenous'' factors that made debt repayment
difficult, such as floods, corruption and civil strife, the last
of which ''the west was so good at pioneering.''  
<P>
   To this, Skolnik explained that ''there was no substitute for
good governance'' and that the Bank should indeed be ''hit hard''
for lending money to bad regimes. 
<P>
   But Antonio Tujan, an activist from the Philippines, disputed
the assertion that Bank funds went into social sectors. In his
country, he said, less than three percent of its loans actually
went into public health.  
<P>
   ''Most of the money goes into projects like the Subic
freeport,'' he said, referring to a vast infrastructure project
for business at a former U.S. military bases, north of the capital
Manila. 
<P>
   Looking at the effects of economic 'reforms' on health, Tujan
said there has been ''progressive destruction of the people's
health agenda'' by the private corporatisation of health services,
which has a curative rather than a preventive approach.   
<P>
   As things stand, Tujan said, he wonders if ''no medicine is
better than bad medicine.''    
<P>
    A panelist from Australia, David Leggae, said that although
the Bank's 'Wealth through growth which would trickle down'
approach provided the rationale for neoliberalism and structural
adjustment, it was also responsible for economic polarisation and
increased mortality. 
<P>
   There are too many fundamental flaws in the Bank's approach, he
said, since it is based on the idea that ''consumption could be
maintained by increasing debt'' and that an economic crisis could
thus be deferred.  
<P>
   Basically, Leggae adds, the game is one of maintaining the
stability and wealth of the North at the cost of the well-being
and health of the South. 
<P>
   He said this game is backed by the Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation (WTO), news
corporations, money markets and rating agencies, among others. 
<P>
   Leggae adds that the only counteraction available to the
''unfair'' global trade regime, which transfers wealth to the
North at the cost of social sectors in the South, is popular
mobilisation like the recent ones seen at trade and economic
meetings in Seattle, Geneva, Melbourne and Paris. 
<P>
   He says also that people's understanding of regulatory regimes
and governance structures in the global system is ''essential to
demand a global trading system which discriminates positively in
favour of poor countries.'' 
<P>
   Leggae advised the Bank to ''apologise for deaths and suffering
caused by structural adjustment and stop claiming privileged
access to divine truth, and acknowledge that embedded in its
recommendations were its core constituency -- the privileged
West.''  
<P>
   Interventions from the floor were even more biting. ''There is
an easy way out of all this -- the World Bank and IMF have enough
resources to cancel debts,'' said Robert Weissman, co-director of
the U.S.-based group Essential Action. 
<P>
   ''The World Bank's own case studies showed that in the last 20
years it had made no effect even on a single district in India,''
pointed out Ravi Narayan from India, the Bank's biggest borrower. 
<P>
   Narayan said while the World Bank may not directly ask for cuts
in social sectors, its adjustment programmes inevitably led to
governments to take on adverse fiscal policies, including
inadequate financial allocations for capital and recurrent costs
for the social sectors. 
<P>
   These same policies led to shortages in health equipment, drugs
and facilities, which happened in India, Narayan says.
In turn, deteriorating conditions bring down the performance of
health personnel, said South African David Sanders. 
<P>
   Commenting on the discussion, Halfdan Mahler, the architect of
the primary health care approach as director general of the World
Health Organisation (WHO) from 1973-1988, told IPS that the Bank
was again ''postponing the coming explosion'' through its
untenable positions. 
<P>
   Mahler blamed the World Bank's ''hijacking of health'' from the
WHO in 1993 and the abandonment of the primary health approach for
the crisis in public health management, especially in developing
countries.
