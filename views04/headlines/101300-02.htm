UNITED NATIONS  - The United States Thursday bluntly
ruled out
any
action by the UN Security Council to contain the escalating
violence in the
Middle East which has resulted in the deaths of over 90
Palestinians since
last
week.
<P>
US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told reporters that Washington
will ''strongly
oppose'' any attempts to bring the issue before the 15-member
Security
Council. 
<P>
As one of the five permanent members of the Council - along with
Britain,
France, China and Russia - the United States can not only wield
its influence
to block any meetings, but also veto any resolution brought before
the
15-member Council. 
<P>
Any negative resolution, Holbrooke warned, will have an
''explosive''
effect on
the situation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. ''We
have made this
abundantly clear to our friends and colleagues in the Security
Council,'' he
added. 
<P>

</TABLE></font>The new round of violence Thursday also threatened to derail the
delicate
negotiations being conducted by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
who has
already
met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yassir
Arafat. 
<P>
On Wednesday, Annan announced that Palestinian and Israeli
officials had
assured him that a meeting will be convened at the highest level
of a
trilateral security committee to deal with the current unrest. 
<P>
This committee, which was set up as a result of a US-brokered
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in 1998, is made up of senior
security
officials of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the United
States. 
<P>
But this announcement has been overshadowed by new violence which
could
endanger the negotiations being conducted by Annan. A UN spokesman
said
Thursday that since Annan was travelling there was no immediate
reaction from
him to the new developments on the ground.  
<P>
Ambassador Nasser al-Kidwa, Permanent Observer of Palestine to the
United
Nations, told reporters that he has formally requested ''an
immediate meeting
of the Security Council'' to resolve the spreading crisis in the
Middle East. 
<P>
Al-Kidwa said he was calling for ''immediate action by the Council
to bring an
end to the illegal military actions and the extremely dangerous
situation that
has developed'' in the West Bank and Gaza. 
<P>
Describing the Security Council inaction as ''scandalous'', he
said that the
Council refuses to act ''only when it concerns Palestinians'' -
implying the
heavy political pressure exerted by Israel on the United States. 
<P>
Last Saturday the United States abstained on a resolution which
deplored ''the
provocation carried out at Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem'' where
a visit by
right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon set off riots in the occupied
territories. 
<P>
The original draft resolution, which called for an international
commission of
inquiry to probe the violence, was watered down to avoid a US
veto. 
<P>
The New York Times reported Monday that US President Bill Clinton
had asked to
delay the vote for 24 hours so he could get personally involved. 
<P>
The Times quoted unnamed US officials as saying that only after
the Israelis
gave their blessings to an abstention - following a change in the
language of
the resolution - that Washington went ahead and abstained. 
<P>
Holbrooke described the resolution as ''biased, one-sided and
unhelpful''. 
<P>
''With that resolution, the Security Council effectively ended its
usefulness
in the Middle East crisis,'' he added.  
<P>
While Washington strongly supported Annan's peace efforts, he
said, any
session
of the Security Council will only jeopardise the Secretary-
General's
mission. A
Council session, he said, will not help peace in the region. 
<P>
Phyllis Bennis, Fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies, argues
that the
United Nations is the right venue for resolving the Middle East
crisis - it
always has been. 
<P>
''It is an international crisis that must be resolved by
international law and
the international community. The US should step back and let the
UN do its
job,'' she says. 
<P>
The request for a Council session came following the killings of
two Israeli
soldiers Thursday. As a result of the killings, the Israeli
military deployed
helicopter gunships to attack the headquarters of the Palestine
Authority and
other targets in the West Bank and Gaza strip. 
<P>
Ali Abunimah of the Arab-American Action Network said that ''it
was entirely
predictable that the killing of two Israeli-occupation soldiers
would produce
banner headlines and moral outrage of a kind that has been all but
absent
during two weeks of massacre of unarmed civilians by Israeli
troops''.  
<P>
''Israel, the occupying power, has taken military actions today
tantamount to
the declaration of an overall war against the entire Palestinian
people, which
is already under military occupation,'' Al-Kidwa said. 
<P>
The Israeli occupying forces, he said, have encroached on
Palestinian cities,
''dramatically increasing their presence in the vicinities of
these cities and
fired rockets from helicopter gunships and Israeli military ships
to destroy
several official Palestinian locations in Ramallah and near Gaza
city.  
<P>
''These violent, military actions have resulted in the loss of
Palestinian
lives and the severe destruction of property in wholly civilian
areas in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory,'' he said. 
<P>
If the Security Council refuses to act, Al-Kidwa said he will have
no choice
but to ask for the resumption of the 10th emergency Special
Session of the
189-member General Assembly so as to bring the entire issue before
a wider 
membership of the United Nations. 
<P>
The Assembly has held four rounds of an ongoing 10th emergency  
Special 
Session, 
beginning in 1997 through 1999, all of which focused on the  
situation in the 
occupied Israeli territories, including East Jerusalem.
