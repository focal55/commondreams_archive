TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP)  Though national environmental groups are
&nbsp;embracing Al Gore, some grass-roots conservationists are
&nbsp;contemplating a protest vote for Ralph Nader - a gesture that could
&nbsp;end up helping George W. Bush in Western states.
&nbsp;
<p>   Nader, a Green Party candidate, is winning support from people
&nbsp;who normally vote Democratic by pressing hardline environmental
&nbsp;proposals on forest policy and other subjects.
&nbsp;
<p>   For example, during a campaign stop here along the Sierra
&nbsp;Nevada's eastern front, he won applause when he said, "I don't
&nbsp;believe there should be logging in federal forests, period." He
&nbsp;also advocated sweeping mine reform.
&nbsp;
<p>   The consumer advocate, who got his start taking on the auto
&nbsp;industry, increasingly is taking aim at Gore's environmental record
&nbsp;- an area thought to be a Gore strength.
&nbsp;
<p>   "He wrote a book in 1992 (Earth in the Balance), that he
&nbsp;completely turned his back on," Nader said during a speech at the
&nbsp;University of Nevada, Reno.
&nbsp;
<p>   The message seems to be resonating with some environmental
&nbsp;liberals who view President Clinton and his vice president as
&nbsp;dealmakers too quick to compromise.
&nbsp;
<p>   "Most of my folks are going to vote for Nader. They will never
&nbsp;vote for Al Gore again," said Tim Hermach, executive director of
&nbsp;the Native Forest Council in Eugene, Ore.
&nbsp;
<p>   Sixteen percent of the old-growth forest that existed when
&nbsp;Clinton imposed his Northwest forest plan has now been logged "on
&nbsp;the way to clearcutting 55 percent of the old-growth we had when he
&nbsp;started," Hermach said.
&nbsp;
<p>   "I think the worst, dumbest Republican is better for us because
&nbsp;we don't perceive him to be our friend."
&nbsp;
<p>   While it's hard to measure Nader's impact, a poll last month in
&nbsp;Oregon - a state that has backed the Democratic presidential
&nbsp;candidate in the past three elections - had Bush at 40 percent,
&nbsp;Gore at 37 and Nader at 7, with a margin of error of plus or minus
&nbsp;4.5 points. Gore and Bush are tied in Washington, another
&nbsp;environmentally conscious state that has voted Democratic in the
&nbsp;past three presidential elections.
&nbsp;
<p>   The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters haven't
&nbsp;decided whether to endorse Gore. But they are leaning that way and
&nbsp;doing their best to defend him against detractors.
&nbsp;
<p>   Among the largest national groups, only Friends of the Earth,
&nbsp;which endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primary, appears to
&nbsp;be realistically weighing a Nader endorsement.
&nbsp;
<p>   A national poll by Zogby International last month found Nader
drawing 6 percent - slightly more than Pat Buchanan's 4 percent -&nbsp;in a field with Bush at 43 percent and Gore at 39. The poll had a
&nbsp;margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.
&nbsp;
<p>   One of Nader's goals is to pull 5 percent or more of the
&nbsp;national vote, which would qualify him for millions in federal
&nbsp;campaign funds.
&nbsp;
<p>   The Gore campaign and its mainstream environmental allies argue
&nbsp;that a vote for Nader is ultimately a vote for Bush, whose record
&nbsp;as Texas governor hardly endears him to conservationists.
&nbsp;
<p>   In addition to Bush's ties to the oil industry, critics point to
&nbsp;Texas' bad air quality, and particularly Houston's crown as the
&nbsp;nation's smog capital of 1999. The League of Conservation Voters
&nbsp;argues that Bush opposed the Kyoto treaty on global warming, worked
&nbsp;to make some Texas air pollution regulations voluntary and
&nbsp;generally advocates a reduced role in environmental enforcement and
&nbsp;regulation.
&nbsp;
<p>   "I'm not sure Ralph Nader has been paying too much attention,"
&nbsp;said Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. "The most productive thing
&nbsp;for an environmentalist to do is to support Al Gore."
&nbsp;
<p>   But some activists say they've been taken for granted by a
&nbsp;Clinton-Gore administration too ready to compromise away old-growth
&nbsp;forests and other habitat for endangered wildlife.
&nbsp;
<p>   Environmentalists in the Sierra Nevada, organized under the
&nbsp;national group American Lands, don't endorse candidates. But
&nbsp;leaders say many will vote for Nader.
&nbsp;
<p>   Brian Vincent, California organizer for American Lands, was
&nbsp;among those who had trumpeted Clinton's proposal to protect
&nbsp;roadless areas in national forests. But he's changed his tune.
&nbsp;
<p>   "We think the administration is talking out of both sides of
&nbsp;its mouth," he said.
&nbsp;
<p>   Clinton unveiled the roadless initiative in October not long
&nbsp;after Friends of the Earth endorsed Bradley.
&nbsp;
<p>   "I think it is pretty obvious it is an election-year ploy to
&nbsp;get environmental endorsements," said Fraser Shilling, a Sierra
&nbsp;Club member who coordinates a research program on land use at the
&nbsp;University of California-Davis.
&nbsp;
<p>   The Sierra Club's national board has identified Bush as the
&nbsp;enemy but hasn't decided whether to endorse Gore over Nader.
&nbsp;
<p>   "If they both take us in the right direction, the question
&nbsp;becomes who can excite people and compel people to vote?"
&nbsp;executive director Carl Pope said from San Francisco.
&nbsp;
<p>   Deb Callahan, executive director of the League of Conservation
Voters, said Gore might have been the victim of inflated
&nbsp;expectations.
&nbsp;
<p>   "Sometimes, advocates who don't really understand the stakes in
&nbsp;some of these policy fights don't acknowledge the role a politician
&nbsp;has to play in forging something that can be passed by Congress,"
&nbsp;she said.
