<p>MILLAU, FRANCE - In a festive display of hostility to the the global marketplace, thousands of protesters descended on a southern French market town Friday for the trial of a sheep-farmer accused of criminal damage to a McDonald's.</p>
<p>Jose Bove, a veteran left-wing militant, was driven to the court-house in the town of Millau with his nine co-defendants in a wagon pulled by a tractor, as the  crowd of environmentalists, trade-unionists, students and other campaigners roared and whistled their support.</p>

</font>The defendants appeared relaxed as they entered the courtroom, presided over by Francois Mallet. The trial was due to last until Saturday because of the large number of witnesses -- 17 by the defence alone.
<p>Bove, 47, who produces Roquefort cheese at his farm on the nearby Larzac plateau, was turned into an overnight star of the anti-globalisation campaign last August after he led the attack on a half-built branch of the fast-food chain in retaliation for US trade sanctions.
<p>McDonald's said the damage cost 750,000 francs (115,000 euros), but lawyers for the defendants were expected to tell the court it was a symbolic act, comprehensible in the context of an on-going struggle between agro-industry and the small farmer.</p>
<p>A number of well-known opponents of globalisation were to be called as witnesses inside the court, while outside crowds gathered from across France at the urging of a support committee to turn Millau into a "Seattle-on-the-Tarn."</p>
<p>The streets of the town were Friday morning festooned with banners, crammed with stalls peddling produce and propaganda, and resounding to the noise of drum-bands, as an array of left-wing and alternative causes lined up to join Bove's campaign to outlaw "malbouffe" -- junk food.</p>
<p>"This is not just about food. It is about the struggle of small people, leading simple lives, to free themselves from the dictatorship of the multi-nationals," said Christian Dignac, 55, who drove 200 kilometresmiles) from Montauban to take part.</p>
<p>Displaying their ideological wares in the form of t-shirts and tracts were defenders of the local Occitan language and of the rights of Zapatista rebels in Mexico, a group representing immigrants in poor French city suburbs, the anarchist party, and Christian Rural Youth.</p>
<p>With experience of agitation going back 30 years, Bove turned last August's attack into a media triumph -- posing memorably in handcuffs outside the Millau court -- and has since successfully played on the widespread suspicion in France towards American big business.</p>
<p>He published a book "The World is not for sale," was received by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, took his cause to protests at Seattle and Davos, and has been on the front page of all the main newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>He said Friday that such was the level of public support he did not see how the court could convict him.</p>
<p>"If it finds us guilty -- and I do not think it will -- then there will be trouble. People will go on the streets across France and cause serious damage to the government," he said.</p>
<p>He and the other nine members of the radical union Peasant Confederation face a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a 500,000 franc fine.</p>
<p>The right-wing mayor of Millau Jacques Godfrain sid it was not right that the court should be put under pressure. "Bove has warned that his supporters will vent their anger (if he is convicted). That is not democracy. Justice should be free from intimidation."</p>
<p>The McDonald's restaurant on the outskirts of Millau -- since rebuilt -- was closed Friday to avoid drawing further violence, with about ten vehicles containing CRS riot police parked outside.</p>
