<i>Editor's note: Reporter Bill Lambrecht traveled to four continents this
year to investigate the sudden spread of genetically
engineered crops and food. Monsanto Co., of St. Louis, is the leader in the
drive to sow these modified seeds globally. In
many countries, Lambrecht found a starkly different view of the new
technology than that of accepting Americans. He also
found an embattled Monsanto making some progress thanks to friends in high
places. A summation of those travels
follows.</i>
<P>
WASHINGTON - In the land of the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s, the Irish protesters
of 1998 sabotaged fields of the American company
genetically re-creating the potato.
<P>
In the red soils of India, farmers worried about that same company gaining
control over their lives. And despite a plague of
pests, they distrusted its promises to deliver magical seeds that give
relief. Last month, in a spectacle of fury called
"Operation Cremation Monsanto," they torched Monsanto Co. test plots of
genetically engineered cotton.
<P>
These events half a world apart were acts in a global drama this year that
has featured St. Louis-based Monsanto, the leader
in the drive to bring genetic engineering to crops and food around the
world.
<P>
The year began with hopes by Monsanto of breakthroughs in global acceptance
of gene-splicing technologies. These
revolutionary techniques transfer genes from one plant to another to give
"transgenic" plants new characteristics, such as
resistance to insects.
<P>
The year ends with the realization that a chasm remains between the
attitudes of Americans and people elsewhere.
<P>
Led by Monsanto and with almost no one outside of agriculture paying
attention, American farmers this year planted more
than 50 million acres of gene-altered soybeans, corn, cotton and potatoes.
Four years ago, that acreage was zero.
<P>
Years from now, people may recall the genetic revolution in food and
farming as an epochal change as far-reaching as the
computer revolution. Yet a historic moment may be passing with few
Americans noticing.
<P>
The same can't be said of the rest of the world. In some nations,Monsanto
is a household name. Newspapers spill over
and broadcasts crackle with news of communities' struggles to come to grips
with a technology banging at the door.
People assemble in noisy forums to debate the morality of altering the
building blocks of life.
<P>
Across the Atlantic, what a Monsanto executive calls the "European Wars"
threatens not only Monsanto's plans but also the
exports by Midwestern farmers of DNA-modified grains. In Britain,
Monsanto's own pollster wrote this bleak assessment
in October:
<P>
"The latest survey shows an ongoing collapse of public support for
biotechnology and genetically modified foods." The
author was Stan Greenberg, who was the White House's pollster in this
administration.
 
<P>
Foreign opposition to Monsanto baffles many Americans.

<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI> Why do people elsewhere feel so differently about an issue of elemental
 importance - the food supply?
<LI> Why are farmers and protesters sabotaging croplands? 
<LI> What is Monsanto doing about it?
<LI> How are people making up their minds about this powerful technology
emanating from St. Louis?
</UL>
<P>
These questions and the likelihood of 1998 being a pivotal year for
Monsanto took a Post-Dispatch reporter on a journey to
10 countries.
<P>
Some of the findings were surprising - among them the involvement of the
National Security Council in the international
debate. Some findings - like the sabotage - were disturbing.
<P>
The search also yielded provocative glimpses of how people in other lands
view Americans. That was the case in
Skibbereen, Ireland, near a mass grave of 8,000 people buried during
Ireland's farm disaster of the last century.
<P>
At her cottage, Mairie Cregan, 37, a farmer and the mother of six, observed
that Ireland's long-ago famine lives on in
people's minds. She worried aloud that genetic tinkering might threaten a
food supply that has grown bountiful. And she
asked if Americans talk about Monsanto at their post offices and in their
church groups the way they do in her part of
southern Ireland.
<P>
"This is about our food and what people eat. Americans know that, don't
they?" she wondered.
<P>
"Maybe," she mused, "America has just gotten too big for people to talk to
each other."
 
<P>
<B>Discoveries</B>
<P>
In conversations elsewhere, the fears of an unproved technology are pitted
against the hopes that genetic engineering can be
a powerful tool for good.
<P>
A potent and even violent opposition to genetic engineering has sprouted in
many places. Often, Monsanto stands alone in
these firestorms. Others have invested heavily in genetic engineering and
farming: Novartis, the Swiss company, and the
German company AgrEvo, to name two.
<P>
But around the world, Monsanto is the acknowledged ringmaster of the
genetic change in food:

<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI> In Europe, many people fear experimentation that crosses genes between
 species. In the literary birthplace of
 Frankenstein, a segment of the population does not look fondly on
   scientists and their discoveries. Europeans use a loaded
 term seldom heard in the United States: GMOs, for genetically modified
 organisms.

<LI> In Latin American nations, many indigenous people resent "bioprospectors" mining and patenting their genetic resources as raw materials for drugs and new farm products. 
<LI> In India, farmers fear the power of multinational corporations and the loss of self-sufficiency. 
<LI> Skeptics in many nations worry about the loss in diversity of crops that they see resulting from fewer companies offering fewer varieties of genetically altered seeds. Monsanto counters that there always will be plenty of choices. 
</UL>
<P>
Everywhere, people see an American company stepping in to promote - indeed
force - changes in how their food is grown.
It's as though the Cardinals or Yankees had swaggered across the world's
soccer fields and declared: "We'll be playing
baseball now."
 
<P>
There is acceptance, too.

<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI> In Europe, amid fierce debate and thanks to U.S. government intervention,
Monsanto gained ground for its crops. Many
European politicians are eager to fix their biotechnology regulatory
system, a 15-country maze of kinks and hoops. You
can find European farmers - a minority - who don't share the qualms of
consumers and environmental advocates.

<LI> In China, 600,000 cotton farmers sowed Monsanto's gene-altered seeds thisyear, the first time they could do so.

<LI>In Brazil, Monsanto planted genetically modified soybeans for the first
time after winning a partial court victory in that
farming and economic powerhouse.

<LI> Deep in Amazon outposts, some tribes are willing to cooperate with
scientists' search for genetic materials, both as a way
to help humankind and to make money.
</UL>
<P>
Amid the global turmoil, genetically engineered plants are taking root.
This year, the acreage outside the United States more
than doubled to nearly 23 million - still less than half what is grown in
the United States.
<P>
This year, Monsanto raced between tense showdowns that commanded news
nearly everywhere but in the United States.
Fighting country-by-country for approvals has enmeshed Monsanto in public
policy around the world.
<P>
Often, the company frames its campaign in the rhetoric of a crusade,
trumpeting the potential to protect the environment and
feed the hungry. "Doing well by doing good," is a company catch phrase. Yet
laudable motives in themselves don't inspire
trust.
 
<P>
<B>Regulatory roots</B>
<P>
Europeans ask why there is so little debate in the United States on genetic
change. There are two main answers:
 
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>The public doesn't demand it.

<LI>Even if people did, there are almost no points of entry for Americans
into a regulatory system that took shape long ago.
</OL>
<P>
In 1986, Monsanto and allies persuaded President Ronald Reagan's
administration to adopt a framework that would
operate with no new legislation. This strategy assured that genetic
engineering would, for the most part, remain out of the
domain of the Congress and therefore away from the forum where people sound
their concerns.
<P>
Americans debated human cloning. And this year, organic growers led a
revolt against the Agriculture Department's
allowing modified foods to be labeled organic. Until then, the only issue
of genetics and food to percolate to the surface in
the United States was the Food and Drug Administration's approval four
years ago of a Monsanto-engineered hormone that
induces dairy cattle to produce more milk.
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has been America's most aggressive
regulator, using existing powers to govern
pesticide traits engineered into plants. That is why Monsanto and farm
groups are pressuring the EPA to reject proposals
for larger protective "refuges" around fields of varieties of modified
crops.
<P>
The FDA exercises limited authority because genetic traits are not
considered food additives. Unlike Europe, which has
passed a continentwide labeling regulation, the FDA has made no move to
require labeling in the United States.
<P>
(In Europe, Monsanto supports this labeling; in the United States, the
company says it doesn't support labeling because it
is not an issue.)
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture operates in the dual role as
regulator and ardent booster of biotechnology.
For most field trials in the United States - like those bringing fears in
Europe - companies simply notify the department.
<P>
But the Agriculture Department couldn't have foreseen that one of its
laboratory successes would create such problems for
Monsanto. That success is a genetic technology known as the "Terminator"
because it renders the seeds of crops sterile so
that they can't be collected and saved. It was patented in March by the
Agriculture Department and a Mississippi seed
company, Delta and Pine Land - which Monsanto is acquiring - as a means to
help companies protect their investments in
genetically modified crops.
<P>
Since then, from Ireland to India, Monsanto has been skewered by critics
and mainstream scientists alike who see
Terminator as a blunt weapon to hasten genetic change.
 
<P>
<B>Irish cooking</B>
<P>

Genetic engineering is about more than farming. In Europe, the debate
touches the environment, economics, religion and
the relationship between science and society. Jean-Marie Pelt, director of
the European Institute of Ecology, said in
Brussels that, "Scientifically, we are able to do things. But from an
ethical point of view, we don't have to do them."
<P>
The European backlash against Monsanto has a lot to do with a deteriorating
faith in science. In Europe, an outbreak of a
mysterious brain malady called bovine spongiform encephalopthy - better
known as "Mad Cow Disease" - brought human
deaths, the slaughter of 11 million cattle and a scar on the European
psyche. In hearings this month in Britain, people
continue to ask what went wrong in science and government regulation.
<P>
Europe's skepticism also is connected to attitudes toward food - even
though no dangers from eating modified foods have
been proved.
<P>
Europeans typically worry more than Americans about food: where it comes
from, how it is presented on the table, how it
tastes. Those sensibilities were on display at Ballymaloe Cookery School in
Ireland's County Cork, where Darina Allen
was testing the flakiness of a student's salmon-filled pastry.
<P>
Allen made headlines this year when she denounced Monsanto's plan to
conduct tests in Ireland on genetically engineered
sugar beets. One plot was adjacent to her 100-acre farm with its gardens,
boxwoods and organically grown produce.
<P>
Irish people listen to Allen. She is their foremost chef, a public
personality with her own television program; she is the
author of best-selling cookbooks; and she sits on Ireland's Food Safety
Authority. She's the Irish Julia Child, with more
spice.
<P>
Students who pay upward of $ 3,000 for courses can get gardening and
"lifestyle" tutoring from Allen, as well as lessons
in sumptuous cooking. She takes them to the slaughterhouse to teach them
about meat. They get to know the farmers who
bring around the vegetables, and they meet the salmon fishermen from nearby
Ballycotton Harbor. On her cooking show
she tells viewers that the most important thing they do each week is
grocery shop for their families.
<P>
In the cooking school dining room, Allen, dressed in her white apron, said
she can't fathom why scientists would want to
be "fiddling around with the genes" of foods. Nor, Allen said, can she
understand why Americans would abide a system in
which genetically engineered foods are not so labeled. "It's a basic human
right to be told what's in your food," she said.
<P>
Her views resemble those of another prominent United Kingdom citizen
standing in the way of the transgenic march.
Britain's Prince Charles drew a line in the sands of European public
opinion in June by writing: "I personally have no wish
to eat anything produced by genetic manipulation, nor do I knowingly offer
this sort of produce to my family or guests."
<P>
Back in County Cork, Ireland, farmer Richard Fitzgerald was more concerned
about his fields than about the famous.
Fitzgerald consented this year to turning over a swath of land to Monsanto
to test genetically modified sugar beets, a
softball-size vegetable that provides one-third of the world's sugar.
Gliding along the Irish seacoast in his black BMW,
Fitzgerald seemed nervous about his decision. He had reason to fret.
<P>
Late on a foggy night, an Irish group called the Gaelic Earth Liberation
Front descended on a Monsanto test plot of
genetically engineered sugar beets in County Carnow where, in the words of
one saboteur, we "ripped out, slashed and
beheaded" plants.
<P>
Fitzgerald, a stocky, florid-faced man who had given up his beloved
Guinness for Lent, gazed toward the Irish Sea and
said: "Who is going to feed the burgeoning population? It's not going to be
the environmentalists growing a few potatoes
organically."
<P>
Fitzgerald's farm was spared in 1998 - though a second Monsanto test plot
was destroyed.
<P>
You lose some, you win others: After a fight, Ireland's High Court last
summer upheld Monsanto's planting permits. That
means the Irish might expect modified cotton and other transgenic crops in
their soils - perhaps even the potatoes that loom
large in Ireland's history and that Monsanto is stacking in the United
States with new genetic traits.
<P>
The outcome of the Irish case was a cautionary lesson for genetic
engineering's critics. Clare Watson, the Dubliner who
forced the court test, was socked with court costs of more than $ 400,000.
<P>
Watson, 36, described what the episode means for her in real-life terms.
For the foreseeable future, she will be allowed
only a living wage for food and housing. She can't own property or
accumulate wealth because it would be taken from her.
"I have my moments when I scream and feel like hitting my head against the
wall," she said.
 
<P>
<B>National security</B>
<P>
Monsanto prepares for uprisings. Last fall, when the Irish debate was
brewing, the company flew a group of Irish
journalists to the United States for a tour of its labs. In Washington, the
journalists received a surprise: They were taken to
the White House for a visit to the Oval Office.
<P>
"Our little heads peeked around that historic room," said Vivion
Kilferther, a reporter from the Examiner in Cork,
describing what few White House visitors see.
<P>
How did Monsanto orchestrate that? It helps if you've hired the president's
director of intergovernmental affairs, which
Monsanto did in putting Marcia Hale on the company payroll.
<P>
Monsanto has often displayed its connections while fighting this year for
approval for its products. When Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern arrived in the United States for a St. Patrick's Day
visit, he was greeted by Sandy Berger, director of
the National Security Council.
<P>
The primary topic of their discussion at a lunch in the Capitol wasn't the
Irish peace talks or any of the world flare-ups that
send the rumpled Berger scrambling in front of CNN's cameras. The issue was
Ireland's pivotal vote on a pending
European decision on Monsanto's corn engineered for insect-resistance -
common in the United States but banned, like
most engineered crops, in Europe.
<P>
The 15-member European Community is vital to Monsanto for reasons beyond
its thriving market of 350 million people.
Europe is the gateway for modified foods; life-science companies want a
European imprimatur on products they hope to
sell to former European colonies around the world.
<P>
But Europe also is the center of opposition to a barely understood
technology studded with red-hot buttons getting pushed.
Germany, with its robust Green Party and its lingering memories of Nazi-era
experiments, is strongly opposed. Austria
and Luxembourg want nothing to do with modified crops. Britain and France,
among others, have doubts.
<P>
This is divergent not just from American public opinion but also from
American policy, which explains scurrying at the top
of the U.S. government.
<P>
"In this post-Cold War era, America's national interests have changed, and
crises aren't always military crises," a National
Security Council official said.
<P>
Berger's wasn't the only voice Ahern heard. Sen. Christopher "Kit" Bond,
R-Mo., and several members of Congress
collared Ireland's prime minister, as did others in President Bill
Clinton's administration. <b>Toby Moffett, Monsanto's
Washington-based international business head and a former Democratic
congressman from Connecticut</b>, later marveled at
the smothering of Ireland's prime minister.
<P>
"Everywhere he went, before people said 'Happy St. Patrick's Day,' they
asked him, 'What about that corn vote?' "
<b>Moffett</b> said. "I'm 54 years old and I've been in a lot of coalitions in my
life, but this is one of the most breathtaking I've
seen."
<P>
Successful, too. The next day, the European governing body said yes to
plantings of gene-crossed corn by Monsanto and
two crops of rivals. The decision also meant that American farmers staking
their futures on exporting modified crops could
rest easier.
<P>
Now all eyes turned to the French, who would have the last word for
Monsanto's hopes and for the future of U.S. farm
exports. But American farmers also have something to fear.    In
Switzerland, authorities in March seized grain barges
from the United States laden with a corn product containing what
authorities called "suspicious DNA." The term
"suspicious DNA" is not something you would hear in the United States,
because Americans don't often view science with
suspicion. Especially farmers.
<P>
If there's a gene that promotes trust in technology, American farmers have
it. The drive to do what it takes for better yield -
more fertilizers, more pesticides, more machinery - sets American farmers
apart from counterparts in Europe, where
farmers depends more heavily on subsidies and quotas.
<P>
And many U.S. farmers are reporting savings from genetically modified seeds
- as much as 50 cents for each bushel of
soybeans, said the Agriculture Department's Arnold Foudin.
<P>
One technology American farmers lack is the mechanism to separate
genetically altered grain before exporting. Those bins
on the edges of Midwestern towns hold the harvests from farmers nearby. In
Illinois, about 40 percent of soybeans and 25
percent of corn in those repositories - modified and unmodified mixed
together - will head by truck or rail to the
Mississippi River to begin their voyage to foreign lands.
<P>
The U.S. farm establishment doesn't want the complications of a separate
system. Nor do farmers want to acknowledge
that what they're growing is any different from what always has sprouted -
even though sensors can detect wisps of
"suspicious DNA." But until other nations sort out their concerns, growing
modified crops for international markets could
be risky.
<P>
In Auburn, Ill., Tim Seifert planted 1,300 acres of black, central Illinois
soil with genetically modified soybeans and corn.
He had been hearing plenty about people in other countries concerned about
the modified grains that Americans send them,
and it troubled him. When a Japanese group visited him this year, Seifert
demanded that they explain their country's
qualms.
<P>
"We weren't afraid to try your technology," Seifert said, lecturing his
visitors.
<P>
Meanwhile, in Mississippi, several dozen cotton farmers had their own
worries about genetic engineering: They demanded
damages from Monsanto this year after their 1997 crop of genetically
altered cotton faltered.
<P>
Some of them farm near the intersection of Routes 61 and 49 where, blues
aficionados will tell you, guitar legend Robert
Johnson sold his soul to the devil in return for success. Farmers making
their case against Monsanto sounded as though
they were repenting a Faustian bargain with Monsanto.
<P>
The Mississippi Seed Arbitration Council sided with these farmers, and many
took home handsome settlements from
Monsanto. (The company insists that weather was the culprit.) One farmer,
Randy Talley, of Bobo, Miss., offered a
lesson in the allure of technology. After swearing that engineered crops
had failed him in 1997, he planted 750 acres of a
gene-spliced cotton seed this year.
<P>
But back in Europe, more sabotage had destroyed hopes for a breakthrough
year in genetic farming.
 
<P>
<B>French connection</B>
<P>
By June, the critical approval that Monsanto thought it had won in Europe
for its corn looked shaky. What's more, a plan
for an American shipment of $ 200 million of genetically altered grain to
Spain and Portugal was in jeopardy. In each case,
the problem was the French, who were refusing to sign what the European
Community had agreed to in March.
<P>
Farmer Rene Riesel was part of the reason. Riesel, a grain and sheep farmer
from the south of France, led the raid earlier
this year that destroyed a cache of modified seeds and all but wrecked
France's first commercial planting of modified corn.
This time, the victim was Novartis.
<P>
The diminutive and tightly wound Riesel, 48, smoked non-filters from a pack
he carried in his rust-colored flannel shirt.
Speaking English at the Concorde Cafe near the French National Assembly, he
recalled the procession of trucks and autos,
carrying 120 farmers, that snaked its way to the center of a small town
near Toulouse. Asked to describe what they had
done, Riesel pulled out his knife and slashed at the air. Then they sprayed
the seed with fire extinguishers, he recounted.
Others said that the farmers had urinated on the mess.
<P>
While eating French fries and spiced, raw ground beef, Riesel spoke
defiantly of French farmers' commitment to block
genetic engineering and to "take out" the fields of those who abet the
technology. Riesel was fined $ 80,000 for the raid but
avoided jail. "It will be quite possible for we French to farm without
transgenics," he said confidently.
<P>
Later, in the town of Le Genest Saint Isle in western France, farmers said
they worried that the consolidation of seed
companies by Monsanto and rivals around the world ultimately will diminish
farmer choices and even force them to use
modified seed
s against their will. But one farmer shook his head and
admonished fellow growers that they need to keep an
open mind. "First, there must be a debate, and then we will see," said this
farmer, Denis Boulanger.
<P>
Leave it to France to stage a debate like the country had never seen
before.
 
<P>
<B>Democracy gets tested</B>
<P>
At the same time France was host to - and winning - the World Cup soccer
championship, its Parliament decided to
convene a citizens conference to guide the nation's policies on genetically
modified foods. Soccer won the battle for
attention, but the conference held as many surprises.
<P>
For the French gathering, 14 people were chosen randomly from a population
of 60 million and brought secretly to the
National Assembly in Paris for the proceedings. What happened in Paris
during a public, three-day gathering was stunning
for its tone and its conclusions.
<P>
The initial reaction to Monsanto from people from all walks of life -
housewives, an insurance inspector, a bank clerk and a
librarian - was uniformly negative.
<P>
"They're sorcerer's apprentices," declared Francine Maeght, 50, a
mild-mannered bank employee.
<P>
Three days later, after an all-night argument, the French citizens
presented recommendations with champagne and caviar.
They offered no glowing endorsement. But they declined to endorse a freeze
on genetic testing, the blunt instrument
European critics seek.
<P>
The French offered another lesson in the persuasiveness of this technology.
The citizens' thinking softened as they heard
scientists tell them how, in its next generation, genetic engineering might
put more nutritious vegetables - even
disease-fighting foods - on dinner plates.
<P>
Claire Falhon, 28, an administrator in a suburban Paris medical clinic, had
begun the gathering by lecturing Monsanto for
barging into her country. Her response was reminiscent of the
coca-colonization chants in Paris streets in the 1950s
protesting the introduction of Coca-Cola. The French, like many skeptics of
genetic engineering, see Monsanto influencing
their culture, not just their farming.
<P>
Falhon confided afterward that she had fought against the freeze. She also
warned that her country must have a "great
debate" and a new regimen of rules before saying yes to Monsanto.
<P>
But Monsanto wanted that "yes" right now. And once more, the company turned
to its most powerful ally - the U.S.
government.
 
<P>
<B>Tapping connections</B>
<P>

In late spring, U.S. trade officials complained to the French government
about the refusal to sign the piece of paper
approving Monsanto's genetically engineered corn. Only then could $ 200
million worth of corn head down the
Mississippi River toward European ports.
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright approached the French, as did U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. Both
leveraged their appeals with ultimatums: If the French didn't relent,
President Clinton would have something to say about it
when France's new prime minister, Lionel Jospin, visited the United States
in June. The French didn't budge, and Jospin
got an earful, administration sources said.
<P>
Monsanto had rallied the president of the United States, the secretary of
state, the national security adviser, America's trade
representative and U.S. senators. That left only Vice President Al Gore,
who didn't stay on the sidelines for long.
<P>
In July, Gore telephoned the French prime minister. On July 30, on the eve
of the announcement of plans for the Donald
Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Monsanto received the good
news: the French had said yes. That meant that
Monsanto's modified corn can be planted in France next spring and that
there will be no prohibition against 15 European
countries importing similar corn.
<P>
A $ 7.5 billion company with 25,000 employees needs to be well-connected,
and Monsanto works to keep it that way. The
company plies political parties equally and recruits people with deep ties
in Washington. By virtue of a friendly relationship
between Monsanto chief operating officer Robert B. Shapiro and Clinton,
Monsanto is identified in Washington as "a
Democratic company."
<P>
Monsanto and its employees spread the political contributions. In the last
two years, donations to Democrats totaled about $
100,000; Republicans received $ 140,000. The company invests much more in
bringing aboard influential people.
 
<P>
Among them:

<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI> Monsanto board member Mickey Kantor is a former U.S. trade representative
 and chairman of Clinton's 1992
 presidential campaign.
 
<LI> Marcia Hale, Monsanto's international regulatory director, was a top
 Clinton assistant.
 
<LI> Linda Fisher, Monsanto's vice president for federal government affairs,
 mapped pesticide policy in the Bush
 administration EPA.
 
<LI> Michael R. Taylor, former deputy FDA commissioner, was hired recently to
 look at long-range matters.
 
<LI> Jack Watson, who was chief of staff in Jimmy Carter's presidency, is a
 Monsanto staff lawyer in Washington.
</UL>
<P>
In wielding its clout abroad, Monsanto has been adroit, lucky - or both. At
this juncture, the interests of Monsanto, the
U.S. government and American farmers are much the same: seeing to it that
the world drops its barriers to an
American-hatched technology.
<P>
Government officials feel the heat sizzling around Monsanto. At a World
Food Summit in Rome, Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman was pelted by seeds thrown by naked protesters. "My mother
worried when she saw me on CNN,"
Glickman joked recently.
<P>
Pressing foreign leaders on these matters "is at the top of my agenda,"
Glickman said. "I am not a shill for any company.
Though we're all generally going in the same direction, we're not riding in
the same car."
<P>
U.S. Special Ambassador Peter Scher, the specialist for agriculture and
biotechnology, visited France several times this
year on biotechnology's behalf and leads a brand-new U.S.-European council
trying to head off more trouble.
<P>
"I would define this not only as a trade issue, but as a domestic economic
issue, an environmental issue and, frankly, a
food security issue," he said.
 
<P>
<B>Fires in India
</B>
<P>
In India, Monsanto is moving aggressively - and meeting aggressive
resistance.
<P>
Three decades ago, India was the testing ground of a farm revolution that
promised more food - and delivered. There, in
the 1960s, science and modern farming introduced the "Green Revolution,"
which fought starvation with high-yield grains
and chemical fertilizer. Now, India is debating whether to play host to the
Gene Revolution. In many places, the fear rivals
the need.
<P>
In the central Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, an extraordinary drama is
unfolding: 500 Indian farmers have killed
themselves in a year's time. All told, 700 farmers in the country committed
suicide since last year. Nothing like this has
happened before in India.
<P>
The farmers' preferred way of death is swallowing insecticides and then
dying in fields that failed them. The real reason,
victims' relatives said, was the volatile combination of debt and farm
chemicals that no longer worked to kill pests.
<P>
"He could not bear the burden," said Ileakomru Shanker, whose son, Damera,
28, had swallowed a fatal concoction in
February.
<P>
Monsanto's insect-resistant seeds - engineered to produce their own
insecticide - might help. The company's first field
trials in India with engineered cotton also showed a 20 percent increase in
yield. But even amid such despair, Monsanto is
viewed with hostility.
<P>
In India, opposition to those seeds is fueled not by concerns about the
environment, as in Europe, but by a strain of
dedicated nationalism. Farmers and intellectuals preaching the mantra of
self-sufficiency inveigh that foreign companies
must not gain a foothold on India's farming and food.
<P>
The Terminator - the genetic technique to forestall seed-saving - is not
yet owned by Monsanto and may not be in fields for
years. Yet Monsanto's detractors hold it up as the symbol of the drive by
multinationals to take control.
<P>
A few months ago, Monsanto's strategists saw India as their next
battleground after Europe. What loomed recently in the
smoke wafting from torched fields in southern India was the likelihood of
fighting on two fronts at once.
<P>
In what they described ominously as Operation Cremation Monsanto, 200
farmers of the 10-million member Karnataka
Farmers Association in southern India uprooted and burned cotton plants in
two Monsanto test plots. "We want Monsanto
out of our country," said N. Nanjundaswamy, the leader of the uprising.
 
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
Wherever Monsanto seeks to sow, the U.S. government clears the ground. In
Japan last month, Agriculture Secretary
Glickman and Trade Representative Barshefsky each told their government
hosts that labeling modified foods wouldn't suit
Uncle Sam.
<P>
This month, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley trumpeted biotechnology
at his four-nation trade mission to Africa to
promote U.S. industries. A Monsanto executive was on the plane.
<P>
"We made the case that they (Africans) ought to take a serious look" at
gene-altered crops, said Daley, speaking by phone
from Ivory Coast. "We strongly encouraged them to make sure that any
decision they make is based on science and not on
this hysterical political reaction."
<P>
From the White House and the National Security Council on down, the
apparatus of the U.S. government worked this year
on behalf of biotechnology. For Monsanto, at this moment, it is like having
an Olympic basketball team with several
Michael Jordans. But Monsanto's clout notwithstanding, U.S. leaders are
unlikely to be rushing to the court once corn and
soybean issues get resolved.
<P>
At year's end, saboteurs in India vow more attacks on Monsanto's fields. In
Britain, authorities are preparing to prosecute
Monsanto for a safety violation that happened when a border around a test
plot was accidentally destroyed. The company's
hard-won French approval for corn is in jeopardy. France's highest judicial
authority has suspended planting permission
for rival Novartis at least until 2000, and now Monsanto is being
challenged on the same grounds by Greenpeace.
<P>
Meanwhile, Europeans and Japanese are pushing for a segregated, genetically
pure crop, which neither the U.S.
government nor American farmers want.
<P>
Still, amid the turmoil, Monsanto gained ground in 1998, observed Philip
Angell, Monsanto's Washington-based
corporate communications chief. He is a former political consultant and
waste industry strategist.
<P>
"What you have is slow and steady, ongoing development and product
introduction," Angell said. "Approval by regulatory
agencies. People listening to people better and trying to understand these
concerns."
<P>
<b>Monsanto's Moffett, the former congressman who operates internationally for
the company</b>, said that 1998 will be recalled
as the watershed year.
<P>
"We discovered how big our learning curve is about the world and, to some
extent, we discovered it because of crises that
maybe we should have seen coming," he said.
<P>
It may also be true that even Monsanto's best persuasive tactics and many
friends in high places can't change attitudes
abroad until consumers see benefits in this technology for themselves, not
just for big companies and farmers. For now,
rightly or wrongly, Monsanto remains bedeviled worldwide by the Terminator,
a public relations problem that was on the
agenda of a meeting in St. Louis this month between Shapiro and company
executives.
<P>
In Illinois, genetic farming stalwart Tim Seifert said things are tight
this year because of low prices for corn and soybeans.
He wondered if farmers are, as he put it, backing themselves into a corner
by producing so much. But, said Seifert, his
faith in modified crops hadn't been shaken one iota. "I'm not looking
back," he said.
<P>
Seifert's words reaffirmed basic differences between Americans and people
elsewhere. These differences have a lot to do
with attitudes toward science and government, but they also speak to
outlook on life.
<P>
In many nations, a prime issue in this debate is choice: the right of
consumers to know the nature of their food and the right
of farmers to have plenty of choices in what they grow. In the United
States, people are willing to trust others to make
those choices for us.
<P>
Few Americans draw a distinction between genetic changes in food and the
biomedical research that is yielding insulin and
products for our health. With soybeans in 75 percent of processed foods,
most Americans have eaten altered food recently
whether they know it or not.
<P>
In the United States, consumers' groups are pressing the call for labeling
these foods. They're working for the first time
with environmental groups, organic food growers and farmers' advocates to
generate an American debate. So far,
Americans have been willing to trust science to direct the course of
evolution. That is the difference between us and many
of our neighbors abroad.
<P>
M.S. Swaminathan, one of India's most prominent scientists, observed
recently: "Any technology, you can use it for good
or bad. If I have a knife, I can cut you or I can cut your food."
<P>
As the world sees it, biotechnology at this moment is a knife unsheathed,
able to cut either way.
