President Clinton issued an executive order 
yesterday to make inexpensive drugs more available in AIDS-ravaged Africa, 
rejecting a plea from pharmaceutical companies to protect their profitable 
patents.
<P>  The order would allow countries to produce or import generic AIDS drugs, 
without fear of trade retaliation, in a region that accounts for one-tenth 
of the world's population and more than 70 percent of its AIDS cases.	 
</P>
<P>  The action came after an amendment containing nearly identical language 
was stripped from a larger Africa trade bill that is likely to pass Congress 
this week. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, author of the amendment, 
threatened to filibuster the bill unless steps were taken to make affordable 
medication more available.	 
</P>
<P>  Feinstein applauded the president's action during an emotional speech on 
the Senate floor, in which she detailed the toll of AIDS on Africa, where 
more people have been infected with HIV than reside in the state of 
California.	 
</P>
<P>  ``How can we provide economic growth and opportunity to sub-Saharan 
Africa if we ignore the fact that the region is facing its worst catastrophe 
of this century?'' Feinstein said, tears welling up.	 
</P>
<P>  Pausing periodically to compose herself during a 90-minute address, 
Feinstein recalled San Francisco's tribulations with AIDS from her days as 
mayor and excoriated the drug companies for trying ``to squeeze every last 
drop of profit from the suffering of millions of HIV/AIDS victims in 
sub-Saharan Africa.''	 
</P>
<P>  ``Why, given that it represented a commonsense approach . . . did my 
amendment meet such stiff opposition?'' Feinstein wonderered aloud, before 
placing the blame on drug company lobbyists.	 
</P>
<P>  ``After long and hard consideration, I have concluded that there can be 
only one possible answer to that question -- profits and corporate greed.''	 
</P>
<P>  The high-stakes debate pits the need of poverty-stricken Africans for 
drugs against the entrepreneurial rights of the drugmakers who have spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop them.	 
</P>
<P>  The president's order, which mirrors Feinstein's legislation, states that 
the United States will not seek to overturn ``any intellectual property law 
or policy'' imposed by a sub-
Saharan African government that promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals 
and medical technologies. In other words, a country that seeks to produce or 
import a generic version of a patented AIDS drug will not face trade 
sanctions from the United States.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Given the devastating impact of AIDS, the United States will not 
require or negotiate restrictive rules in the intellectual property rights 
area,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. 	 
</P>
<P>  ``This executive order is intended to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in 
sub-Saharan Africa by making AIDS-related drugs and medical technologies 
more accessible and affordable,'' she said.	 
</P>
<P>  Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers 
of America, criticized the executive order for adopting a ``discriminatory 
approach to intellectual property laws'' and focusing exclusively on 
pharmaceuticals. 	 
</P>
<P>  ``We recognize that AIDS is a major problem,'' Holmer said in comments 
quoted by the Associated Press. ``But weakening intellectual property rights 
is not the solution.''	 
</P>
<P>  Feinstein noted that the $1,000-a-
month cost of AIDS treatment in the United States is many times higher than 
the annual income of many African victims, a problem she said is exacerbated 
by an industry blindly driven by profits.	 
</P>
<P>  She used the example of one drug, fluconazole, used to treat a common 
fungal infection in HIV-
positive people, which is available as a generic drug in Thailand for $1.20 
a day but sold in March for $17.84 a day in Kenya and South Africa, where 
the only supplier is Pfizer. (Pfizer however, she noted, has recently agreed 
to provide free fluconazole to South Africa).	 
</P>
<P>  ``Simply put, the pharmaceutical companies which manufacture HIV/AIDS 
drugs would prefer to be able to sell drugs for $18 a dose rather than $1 
per dose, with the additional $17 going straight to fattening the bottom 
line.''	 
</P>
<P>  Representatives from the pharmaceutical industry did not return phone 
calls to respond to Feinstein's criticisms. But they have previously 
insisted that their intellectual property rights must be protected to 
provide the incentives necessary to encourage costly research and 
development of AIDS-fighting drugs.	 
</P>
<P>  Some drug manufacturers have also maintained that the free distribution 
of drugs will lead to misuse and might spur the growth of a drug-resistant 
strain.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I don't know how they sleep at night, I really don't,'' Feinstein said 
of the drug company lobbyists who blocked her amendment. ``I'm sorry for my 
show of emotion, but I've seen people die of AIDS.''	 
</P>
<P>  ``I remember, as mayor of San Francisco, trying to manage this disease in 
its early days, when cause, let alone treatment, was unclear,'' she said. 
``When HIV/AIDS was devastating our community, and many, many promising 
young people -- many of them my friends -- were struck down in the prime of 
their lives.	 
</P>
<P>  ``So in some small way, I think I understand what policy makers in any 
sub-Suharan African countries are going through now.''
