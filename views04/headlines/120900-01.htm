SACRAMENTO<wbr> - <wbr>It has become one of the most expensive public policy
miscalculations in California history:
<p>A 1996 state deregulation plan that was supposed to make electricity
cheaper instead shifted billions of dollars from utilities and consumers
to energy companies and electricity brokers.
<p>California businesses and residents paid $10.9 billion more for
electricity last summer than the year before, with much of the money
flowing to out-of-state energy firms. One of them, Houston-based Reliant
Energy, saw its wholesale energy profits jump 600% during that time, with
about $100 million coming from California.
<p>The dramatic increases are the result of critical misjudgments by the
California Public Utilities Commission and the state Legislature, the two
main architects of the plan to open the market.
<p>Most serious were:
<p>* A gross underestimation of demand as the state's economy came to
life after years of recession and California's burgeoning computer-based
businesses ate up electricity at rates unheard of in the old economy.
<p>* A failure to anticipate that energy companies could easily exploit a
mechanism designed to ensure the even flow of electricity. By holding
back electricity and selling when the system was desperate, they could
earn double the going rate.
<p>* A faulty assumption that deregulation would prompt more competition
right away: Hundreds of companies were expected to serve homeowners, but
they didn't materialize. At times, a few power plant owners can
effectively control the price of electricity.
<p>In their attempt to foster competition, the designers of deregulation
traded a monopoly in which government set rates for a new marketplace in
which prices can fluctuate.
<p>The first place to suffer the consequences was San Diego, where prices
doubled and tripled. By July, the monthly electric bill for William
Scerni's coin laundry in a poor neighborhood in Oceanside jumped from
$1,100 to $2,600. He raised the cost of a wash on his 30 most popular
washing machines by 25 cents--which generated only $800 more a month.
<p>This week, the panic spread. Officials begged customers to keep
holiday lights off and warned of blackouts in a season when power demands
are relatively low. To avoid blackouts, they bought power at astronomical
prices that will be passed on to debt-burdened utilities.
<p>A few cities--including Los Angeles, Glendale, Burbank, Riverside,
Anaheim and Sacramento--are unaffected, because they own their power
systems and are exempt from deregulation. But rate shock looms for 24
million Californians served by the state's two largest utilities,
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
<p>For the moment, those consumers are protected by a rate freeze. But
the utilities, which serve 5.6 million people in Los Angeles County and
millions more in surrounding areas, have paid $6 billion more for
electricity than they can legally charge customers, and assert that they
will be crippled unless regulators allow them to recover those costs.
<p>"California was hailed as the model for the rest of the nation," said
consumer advocate Harry Snyder. "And it has been a model--on how not to
do it."
<p>The stakes are far-reaching: the political ambitions of California's
governor, the economic future of new industries and old, and the future
of national energy policy.
<p>Price spikes in California last summer drove electricity costs across
the West high enough to trigger the shutdown of mines, aluminum factories
and sawmills.
<p>Nevada's governor, alarmed by California's experience, recently
suspended his state's launch of deregulation. Arkansas is moving to delay
deregulation by at least two years. Twenty-five states moving toward
deregulation could be affected by the outcome in California.
<p>Some fear deregulation was a solution for an old economy that has been
eclipsed. California is now at ground zero of the Internet boom, dotted
with the quiet, cold, computer-filled warehouses that suck up as much
electricity as small cities.
<p>"We put in place an answer to the problems of the steel mills and
cement plants at a time when Cisco and Qualcomm were becoming the growth
sectors of the California economy," said Carl W. Wood, a PUC member. ". .
. . People have been fighting the last war, not the coming war."
<p>Free-market proponents acknowledge massive problems but insist that
California's new electricity market can work--with some tinkering, the
rapid construction of power plants and more time.
<p>"I think we have a problem that is amenable to solutions," said
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy
Institute in Berkeley, "if the politicians are willing to go for
solutions that will cause some pain, because there is going to be some
[consumer] pain."
<p>How to split a monstrous bill between consumers and utilities, how to
bring down prices, how to rapidly boost the state's supply of electricity
and whether to reimpose regulation--these issues have become the biggest
challenge for Gov. Gray Davis in his 2-year-old administration.
<p>Last month's average prices for electricity in California were more
than three times higher than in November 1999. At times, almost one third
of the power is being bought at exorbitant rates by an agency that was
expected to handle only 5% of the energy consumed.
<p>Six investigations by state and federal agencies are underway, seeking
evidence of collusion or other illegal behavior. Multimillion-dollar
lobbying efforts in Sacramento are intensifying. Edison and PG&E are
sinking millions of dollars deeper into debt each day.
<p>And experts say next summer could easily bring blackouts and more
billion-dollar price run-ups.
<p>A Times review of hundreds of documents and interviews with dozens of
people tell the story of the state's miscalculations.
<b><br>
<p>The Roots
</b>
<p>In 1994, California was just emerging from a deep, stubborn recession
and its average electricity prices were topped only in Alaska, Hawaii,
New York, New Jersey and New England.
<p>In the previous three years, California had lost nearly 750,000 jobs.
Major industries warned that the high price of electricity would drive
them out of the state.
<p>There were two forces driving electricity costs here: nuclear power
and green power.
<p>California's two nuclear power plants, which provide about 20% of the
state's electricity, suffered massive cost overruns that were largely
passed on to consumers. PG&E's Diablo Canyon plant in San Luis Obispo
County was estimated in 1965 to cost $400 million, but ended up costing
$5.8 billion. The San Onofre plant in San Diego County, jointly owned by
Edison and SDG&E, was budgeted at $1.3 billion but cost $4.3 billion.
<p>The 1970s energy crisis also contributed. In 1978, frightened by the
nation's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, Congress forced utilities to
buy electricity from companies willing to produce it with solar panels,
windmills, farm waste or factory steam.
<p>California regulators, miscalculating how high oil and natural gas
prices would go, priced that alternative electricity so high that the
state became a mecca for the green energy industry. By 1994, California
was home to 80% of the nation's wind and solar energy sources, and
utilities were locked into long-term contracts.
<p>For example, Southern California Edison estimates that since 1985 it
has paid $25 billion more for electricity under alternative energy
contracts than it would have spent to produce the energy by traditional
means--and has passed those costs on to its customers.
<p>"We said, 'Something's wrong with this picture,' " recalled Earl
Bouse, whose Hanson Permanente Cement plan in Cupertino, Calif., was
paying rates three times what they would have been in Idaho.
<p>What Bouse and other big manufacturers began lobbying for was the
ability to buy their electricity from companies other than SDG&E, PG&E or
Southern California Edison, the three big private utilities regulated out
of San Francisco by the state Public Utilities Commission.
<p>For nearly 100 years, regulators had set rates and guaranteed an
investment return for the utilities' stockholders. Delivering electricity
is a natural monopoly; it makes little sense for companies to string up
thousands of miles of duplicate power lines to win customers. In exchange
for that monopoly, the utilities agreed to government regulation so they
couldn't make exorbitant profits.
<p>Critics said that gave utilities little incentive to trim costs, since
most could be passed on to customers. "Everything the utilities touched
became much more expensive," said D.J. Smith, a Sacramento lobbyist for
the California Large Energy Consumers Assn.
<p>Former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson believed that the state's utilities
had become bloated under regulation.
<p>"It was not ideology that persuaded us to go to deregulation," said
George Dunn, Wilson's deputy chief of staff at the time, now a lobbyist.
"It was an assessment of what was going on."
<p>After declaring the system "fragmented, outdated, arcane and
unjustifiably complex," the PUC voted in December 1995 to open the
state's electricity industry to competition.
<p>The commission's order resembled an agreement that Dunn had brokered
three months earlier, largely behind closed doors, with Southern
California Edison, its biggest industrial customers and an association of
independent power producers. All parties pledged to support legislation
that would create an independent power market.
<p>The parties also agreed that the utilities could pass on an estimated
$28 billion they spent investing in nuclear and alternative energy.
<p>Consumer activists argued that many of those investments were the
result of bad decisions by the utilities and should be absorbed by
shareholders. But consumers were largely shut out of the negotiations.
<p>The deal "was tantamount to the tablets being brought down the
mountain by [Edison chief] John Bryson," said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network. "The governor [Wilson]
. . . wanted to be elected president . . . wanted to make a big splash
that would get him attention and also help him raise money."
<b><br>
<p>The Peace Plan
</b>
<p>The lobbying dollars told the story of just how high the stakes were
during the historic 1996 deregulation debate in Sacramento: The three
utilities spent $4.3 million on lobbyists and pumped more than $1 million
into political campaigns.
<p>The PUC decision alone could have dictated deregulation. But utilities
wanted more certainty for California's $23-billion-a-year electricity
industry than a regulatory order that could be changed by a new governor.
<p>So in the summer of 1996, the Legislature intervened.
<p>Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) chaired the Senate energy committee. He won
the job of guiding the deregulation legislation. Then 43, with 13 years
in the Legislature, Peace had a reputation as a brainy, caustic lawmaker
willing to take on the most complex issues.
<p>He orchestrated endless meetings, sometimes five at once, and kept
people at the table late into the night. In the final weeks of the
session, Peace sometimes ordered lobbyists out of the room, telling them
to return in 15 minutes with their issues resolved.
<p>"The Steve Peace death march," said Bill Leonard, a former Republican
state senator, now an assemblyman from San Bernardino. "It was group
dynamics at its best and worst."
<p>Utilities enjoyed easy access and insider status. David Takashima, for
example, was Peace's chief of staff when the legislator was an
assemblyman in the 1980s. Takashima left to work as a Sacramento lobbyist
for Edison, then returned to Peace's Senate staff in time to help write
the deregulation bill in July 1996. Now Takashima works for PG&E as
director of governmental affairs.
<p>Consumer advocates say they could not match the political firepower or
research capability of big business or the utilities. Each group set out
to protect its interests. Environmentalists won preservation of a
half-billion-dollar annual subsidy for renewable energy. Labor won money
to retrain utility workers.
<p>Several consumer groups grudgingly concluded that the legislation was
an improvement over the PUC plan, and agreed not to oppose it.
<p>"It was not my finest hour," said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for the
Utility Reform Network. "In retrospect, we should have opposed it flat
out."
<p>Not one lawmaker voted against the bill--even though many had only a
dim sense of how they were launching what Peace has called "the most
complex transition of an industry done anywhere in the world."
<p>On Sept. 23, 1996, Wilson signed the bill.
<p>"We've pulled the plug on another outdated monopoly," he said that
day, "and replaced it with the promise of a new era of competition."
<p>Although he was not the bill's final author, Peace became the face and
voice of deregulation.
<p>"This bill would not have passed out of both houses with no negative
votes had it not been for the determination and tenacity of Steve Peace,"
bill author Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) said at the time. Then an
assemblyman, Brulte currently is state Senate minority leader.
<p>Today, Peace is ridiculed for his hubris. Critics gloat that there is
poetic justice in his own San Diego constituents being among those most
hurt by last summer's price spikes.
<p>Peace blamed the summer price surges on the state's shortage of
electricity, greedy power producers and federal regulators who declined
to referee the new market.
<p>Peace is not apologetic. The PUC decision unaltered, he said, would
have been much worse for the state. Peace vigorously defends the
legislative process he guided as fair, honest and open. The deregulation
bill was "a good work product," Peace said recently. "It's not what
caused the problems."
<p>There was another reason, besides Peace's persuasive powers, that the
bill passed unanimously: It included a 10% rate reduction and a rate
freeze.
<p>To make the change politically palatable to consumers, the lawmakers
rolled back electricity rates by 10% for the 27 million people served by
the three big utilities, and froze rates until March 31, 2002, or until
the utilities paid off all of their past investments, whichever came
first.
<p>Consumer groups called the move a political "fig leaf." In fact, the
utilities were allowed to float $7 billion in bonds to pay for the 10%
rate rollback. Because customers are paying off those bonds today, over
10 years, the promised 10% cut amounts to more like 3%.
<b><br>
<p>The Carlsbad Plant
</b>
<p>The power plant in Carlsbad is an ugly landmark. Wrapped in cyclone
fencing, the 46-year-old gas-fired industrial misfit looms over one of
northern San Diego County's most popular beaches.
<p>But it can generate enough electricity to supply nearly 1 million
homes, and SDG&E tended it carefully for decades. Then, in March 1998,
the utility auctioned the plant.
<p>Packaged with 18 small combustion turbines scattered around San Diego
County, it sold for $365 million--nearly four times the book value. That
should have been an early warning.
<p>Selling off the utilities' gas- and oil-fired power plants was key to
deregulation. The idea was to make sure there were so many new power
plant owners that none could single-handedly influence the price of
electricity in California's new marketplace.
<p>But the statewide auctioning of power plants backfired. Private energy
companies from all over the country engaged in bidding wars and paid
higher-than-expected prices--a sign of how profitable new players figured
the California market might be.
<p>A partnership of Houston-based Dynegy and Minneapolis-based NRG Energy
bought the Carlsbad package. Seven other energy companies, all but one
based out of state, purchased the utilities' mainstays, including plants
at Morro Bay, Long Beach, El Segundo and Huntington Beach.
<p>The buyers spent more than $3 billion to take title to power plants
critical to California's trillion-dollar economy.
<p>No other state, in attempting to deregulate, did what California did:
triggered a sweeping divestiture without making certain that the new
owners would have to sell their electricity at a fixed price for a number
of years, said Borenstein, the Berkeley economist.
<p>"To sell the power plants was stupid," said Assemblyman Roderick
Wright (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the lower house's utilities and
commerce committee. "To sell the power plants without contracting for the
electricity borders on criminal."
<p>Having sold its electricity assets, California now has to rent, Wright
said: "And the price of rent is going to be whatever the new guy paid for
your power plant plus the price of electricity."
<p>In San Diego, the auction set the stage for what politicians would
come to call an economic disaster.
<p>SDG&E's earnings from the Carlsbad sale were so much higher than
expected that its $2 billion in debt was quickly wiped out. That
triggered the end of the rate freeze the Legislature had imposed to
protect consumers through a four-year transition to deregulation.
<p>More than 3 million San Diego and southern Orange County residents
became unwitting guinea pigs. On July 1, 1999, they began for the first
time to pay electricity prices determined by a market, not a regulator.
<p>For a while, nobody noticed. The average homeowner's monthly bill had
been $50.60 under the freeze; it averaged $53.60 for the first 10 months
San Diegans paid market prices.
<p>Then the first heat wave of the new millennium hit, in May.
Californians cranked up air-conditioners. Demand for electricity rose.
Prices climbed.
<p>A kilowatt-hour is about enough electricity to operate a computer and
monitor for seven hours. On April 29, it cost 2.7 cents to buy that much
electricity at a time of peak demand. Two weeks later, it cost 3.5 cents,
and two weeks after that it was 5.7 cents. By June 15, it cost 46 cents;
two weeks later, even on a day with less demand, it cost 52 cents.
<p>None of this mattered much to the 24 million Californians served by
PG&E and Edison and still shielded by the rate freeze. But in San Diego,
those prices tugged hard on wallets and checking accounts.
<p>By the end of August, when the Legislature intervened and imposed
price caps, monthly bills had reached an average of $120 for a homeowner.
Some bills began to match monthly rent. Cafes dimmed lights and shut off
air-conditioning in the middle of the afternoon.
<p>In Oceanside, William Scerni couldn't raise prices at his coin laundry
enough to cover his increased costs.
<p>"We're just vending utilities," said Scerni, 64. "We're vending hot
water, heat for dryers and electricity to run washers and dryers."
<b><br>
<p>The Power Markets
</b>
<p>At dawn on March 31, 1998, the largest, most accessible electricity
market in the world was born on the fifth floor of an office building in
Alhambra: the California Power Exchange. This is where the price of
electricity for Scerni's washers and dryers was set--a digital auction
with banks of computers.
<p>Companies that want to buy electricity submit, via computer, the
amount of electricity they will need the next day and the price they are
willing to pay. Those with electricity to sell offer a quantity and a
proposed price.
<p>Once an hour, the Power Exchange computers set the price at the point
where the demand and supply bids meet. Employees later collect checks
from buyers and pay sellers.
<p>Through 1998 and 1999, everything seemed to be working. The price that
utilities paid for electricity in the Power Exchange tended to be
lower--sometimes much lower--than the price they could charge consumers.
<p>By late spring 2000, the gap amounted to $6 billion for PG&E and $5
billion for Edison, according to consumer groups. The companies now raced
to pay off past investments in nuclear and alternative energy before the
freeze expired.
<p>When electricity prices shot up in the summer, most experts patiently
explained: It's supply and demand.
<p>No new major power plants have been built in California in the last 10
years, mostly because no utility or private energy firm wanted to make
such a massive investment without knowing how deregulation would unfold.
<p>But just as California launched deregulation, the state's economy
rebounded. Job growth shot up at least 3% each year. Peak demand for
power began increasing annually by roughly the output of two major power
plants.
<p>California imports 20% of its electricity. Just when the state needed
it most, fast-growing cities such as Phoenix and Las Vegas began sucking
up the West's surplus electricity. And late runoff on the mighty rivers
of the Pacific Northwest meant that turbines there could not deliver
electricity in the quantities California needed to run air-conditioners
on the hottest days last summer.
<p>In one of their major miscalculations, the architects of deregulation
never anticipated this shortfall.
<p>In fact, records from the debate in Peace's legislative committee
hearings show the opposite: concern that a glut of electricity would keep
anybody from making money in the new market. Few people forecast such a
long economic expansion.
<p>"We started out with 30% excess capacity," said P. Gregory Conlon, a
former PUC commissioner. "We thought we had enough time to get this up
and running."
<p>As last summer wore on, prices stayed high even through cooler
weather, on weekends and at night--periods when prices usually drop with
demand. Something was up.
<p>They call it "market power": the ability of a supplier to increase
prices for a sustained period of time. Electricity sellers can do that
by, for example, withholding some of the power they have to sell so
there's less electricity in the market and buyers become willing to pay
more to get what they need.
<p>Frank A. Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the
California electricity market, estimates that average prices last summer
were 37% to 182% higher than would be expected in a perfect competitive
market.
<p>"Why are prices on a Sunday in 1999 seven times lower than prices on a
Sunday in 2000?" asked Bob Foster, an Edison senior vice president. "Same
load [demand], no plants are out or anything like that. What would do
that? . . . As demand started going up, the marketers figured out a way
that they could exercise market power."
<p>The people who make electricity have another answer. They say it costs
more to produce this year than last. The price of natural gas, the main
fuel burned to generate electricity, had tripled in the first 11 months
of this year, and now is at least 16 times as expensive as it was last
year in California.
<p>Smog rules can add 5 cents or more to the price of producing a
kilowatt-hour, and some plants have been run so hard for so long that
they must be shut down to avoid violating those rules. But most
importantly, power producers say, supply is tight.
<p>"The market price reflects the new market reality," said Gary
Ackerman, who represents electricity traders, a relatively new profession
in California, as the director of the Western Power Trading Forum. "The
world has changed. The market reflects that."
<b><br>
<p>Market Marauders
</b>
<p>Anyone can tap into the Internet and learn hourly prices in
California's electricity market. But not until six months later is it
possible to tell the names of bidders, the quantities they bid and the
names of buyers.
<p>That was intended to foster competition, but it can also hide
manipulation.
<p>Authorities say there is no doubt that companies can keep prices high
to make more money.
<p>"We've had hours of true scarcity, where supply just simply isn't
enough to meet demand," said Eric Hildebrandt, who monitors the
electricity market for the agency that oversees transmission. "For every
hour of that, there's many more hours sandwiched around that of
tremendous market power.
<p>"Rising gas prices, higher loads, supply disruptions--all those create
an increase in the underlying cost," he said, "but they also create the
potential for market power."
<p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, national overseer of
wholesale electricity, gave California the authority to sell electricity
at market-based rates only as long as its market proved itself "workably
competitive." Market power means, in effect, that one supplier on its own
can influence the price, in a way akin to a monopoly.
<p>On Nov. 1, FERC commissioners called the California market "seriously
flawed" and said they found clear evidence of market power.
<p>But in a draft order, FERC pinned no blame on specific electricity
producers. And it declined to order rebates on last summer's electricity
bills. A final decision from the commission is expected Wednesday.
<p>How much profit each of the players is making is not public record.
Still, for all of the new power plant owners in California's electricity
market, net income rose at least 75% between the summer of 1999 and that
of 2000, according to company earnings statements.
<p>Reliant Energy, for example, posted a 600% increase in the
third-quarter earnings of its wholesale energy division. California
accounted for about $100 million of the $276-million increase, said
Richard Wheatley, spokesman for the Houston company.
<p>"A blind pig could make money in this market," said S. David Freeman,
general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, one of
the publicly owned agencies that is selling electricity in California and
profiting by it.
<p>In the last 18 months, the DWP has earned more than $200 million
selling electricity, Freeman said.
<b><br>
<p>The Power Play
</b>
<p>The twin phenomena of record profits and power shortages collide in a
powerful agency known by the unassuming acronym of Cal-ISO.
<p>Electricity cannot be stored like wheat or cotton. The stream of
electrons pumped into transmission wires must constantly match the rate
of consumption off that grid by air-conditioners, computers, Christmas
lights. A surge of electricity with nowhere to go or a sudden, heavy draw
on the grid can destabilize hundreds of miles of transmission lines,
causing blackouts to millions of people. On Thursday, California narrowly
averted such a scenario.
<p>To guarantee reliability, the architects of deregulation created a
nonprofit institution, the California Independent System Operator, that
they believed would play a supporting role in fine-tuning the system.
Cal-ISO workers monitor the ebb and flow of electrons on the part of the
grid that serves 75% of the state. (Federal, state and municipal
agencies--including the city of Los Angeles--control the other 25%.)
<p>To avoid blackouts, Cal-ISO workers may make sudden purchases of
electricity at whatever price necessary. "We keep the lights on," they
like to say.
<p>But for sellers, Cal-ISO became a way to bypass the competitive price
set by the electronic auctioning on the Power Exchange. And the more
power that producers reserved to sell through Cal-ISO, the less was
available through the regular market.
<p>In June, during peak demand, California's market meant producers could
earn $1.50 on a kilowatt-hour of electricity that cost no more than 15
cents to generate. Here's how: They got paid 75 cents to be on standby
when a crisis loomed and the grid guardians at Cal-ISO needed the power
most. Then the power plant owners or marketers earned another 75 cents by
actually selling the electricity at the going rate.
<p>"They know to go where the money is," said Gary Stern, chief of market
monitoring for Southern California Edison.
<p>The designers of Cal-ISO figured that at most it would handle 5% of
the electricity consumed in California. But at times this year, the
volume was 30%, according to Cal-ISO.
<p>On certain hot days, Cal-ISO workers, finding the grid strained and
with only hours to spare before a blackout, would desperately call places
ranging from British Columbia to Arizona seeking enough electricity for 6
million homes.
<p>In the summer of 1999, such purchases cost $1 million. A year later,
they totaled more than $100 million.
<p>"When the ISO says we'll do anything to keep the lights on," said
Borenstein, the Berkeley economist, "they're inviting people to bid
whatever they want."
<p>Ackerman, who represents electricity traders and generators, said
sellers are simply bidding to get the best price for their product, "just
like General Motors does for its cars and a Kansas farmer does for his
wheat. . . . Otherwise we're back to that old-time religion--regulation."
<p>Utility executives say that their problem is too much regulation even
now, and that they've got the worst of both worlds.
<p>They say they could have saved billions of dollars last summer if they
had been able to sign long-term deals to buy electricity directly from
suppliers rather than buying at the market rate each day through the
Power Exchange, which has proved volatile and expensive.
<p>The PUC forced the utilities into the marketplace in part to guarantee
the Power Exchange enough business. Commissioners also feared that, given
the chance, utilities would lock up all the cheap electricity and stifle
competition.
<p>In New England, Australia and the linked New
Jersey-Pennsylvania-Maryland markets, at least 80% of the electricity
bought and sold is arranged for in advance. Here, less than half of
trades are "hedged" that way.
<p>Federal energy authorities intend to change that and allow utilities
to buy electricity outside the Power Exchange.
<p>Several producers say they stand ready to sign such deals. The PUC has
hesitated to approve them, fearing that contracts signed now, with prices
exceptionally high, will hurt consumers in a year or two if prices drop.
<p>But "[even] if you lock in a price that isn't the lowest," said
Assemblyman Wright, "you also avoid the highest."
<b><br>
<p>False Choices
</b>
<p>One of the great benefits of deregulation, lawmakers boasted in 1996,
would be choice. Everybody from supermarket owners to apartment dwellers
would be able to pick the company that purchased their electricity and
mailed the monthly bill. Giant utilities that once controlled electricity
from turbine to toaster would do nothing but maintain wires.
<p>The postcards said so. With $87 million set aside in the deregulation
bill for public education, regulators sent postcards to utility
customers, telling them choice was on the way.
<p>Other states deregulated in stages, cutting big industrial customers
free from utilities before putting homeowners into the marketplace.
California opened its doors to everybody from the onset.
<p>The crafters of deregulation figured that entrepreneurs would create
hundreds of new companies to lure customers away from utilities by
offering cheaper electricity or electricity generated in environmentally
friendly ways.
<p>The notion was that these new companies would absorb the risk of
volatile electricity prices, giving customers stable rates. And they
would keep prices low by competing among themselves.
<p>It didn't work out like that.
<p>There was early enthusiasm. More than 300 companies indicated
interest. But they quickly dropped away.
<p>"They couldn't find a source of power cheaper than the Power
Exchange," said Michael Peevey, who retired as president of Southern
California Edison in 1993 and launched his own energy company, New
Energy.
<p>Today fewer than 10 companies offer California homeowners electricity
service.
<p>They're bit players. As of the end of September, less than 2% of
nearly 9 million California homeowners and renters had switched to a new
supplier. Most who did picked Green Mountain Energy, a company that
appeals to those willing to pay a premium to foster clean electricity
generated by renewable resources. Slightly more than 5% of small
businesses have switched, but 13% of energy-intensive industrial
customers changed providers.
<p>"Generally the bigger customers have been able to cut deals to get
discounts of 2% to 5%," said Bill Booth, regulatory attorney for the
California Large Energy Consumers Assn., whose members pushed hard for
deregulation.
<b><br>
<p>The Utility Problem
</b>
<p>To survive as private businesses, utility executives say, they need a
release from the terms of deregulation. If they get what they want, it
could cost consumers billions.
<p>By the end of October, the difference between what the state's two
biggest utilities had paid for electricity and what they were allowed to
pass on to customers had tallied $3.4 billion for PG&E and $2.6 billion
for Edison. Executives are warning of "financial meltdown."
<p>So far the utilities have been able to borrow enough money to cover
their costs, and bankruptcy looks a long way off, said Lori Woodland, who
analyzes the loan worthiness of the utilities for Fitch Inc., a
credit-rating agency. But a resolution must come soon, she said.
<p>"There's an enormous amount of money involved here," she said, "and
it's flowing out of the door of the utilities at an alarming speed."
<p>PG&E and Edison both have asked the PUC to let them boost rates by at
least 10% and collect enough money to pay the debt of last summer over
the next several years. Utility executives say that to force the people
who own stock in Edison and PG&E to absorb the $6 billion loss would
destroy institutions critical to the state's economy.
<p>"We are the only thing standing between the consumer and volatility,"
said Foster, the Edison vice president. ". . . We have to remain
financially healthy."
<p>Consumer advocates argue that the utilities knew electricity prices
could spike during the rate freeze and chose that risk.
<p>A letter from PG&E to Peace, dated July 25, 1996, during negotiations
on the deregulation bill, says: "It is highly uncertain what market
prices will result from the proposed power exchange structure."
<p>Said consumer advocate Snyder: "The marketplace means you win or you
lose. The utility companies that wanted to go to the marketplace lost the
bet."
<b><br>
<p>The Next Hot Summer
</b>
<p>There's no quick fix in sight.
<p>By next summer, experts figure, there will be a gap of at least 1,000
megawatts--what a major power plant produces--between what the state
consumes on its hottest days and what it can generate and import.
<p>Then, most experts agree, the grid guardians at the Cal-ISO will once
again find themselves repeatedly declaring power reserves dangerously
low. They'll scramble to buy electricity and they'll beg Californians to
dim lights and wait until midnight to run the clothes dryer.
<p>Four new power plants are under construction in California, but it
won't be until July, at best, that any of them spins a turbine. Most
likely to be finished first is a 500-megawatt plant owned by Calpine in
the Bay Area city of Pittsburg.
<p>Plans for another major power plant were approved by the California
Energy Commission last week, and 12 more are under review.
<p>But there's no guarantee that they all will get built.
<p>There's no easy answer on the other side of the equation, either.
<p>The Legislature this year earmarked $50 million for electricity
conservation projects, such as helping cities install new traffic light
bulbs and coat office rooftops with heat-reflecting paint. Lawmakers also
extended for another decade a fee on electricity bills that amounts to
roughly a nickel a day per household. The fee generates about half a
billion dollars a year for conservation and "green" energy projects.
<p>But these investments won't soon bring power supply and demand into
line. The imbalance is expected to trigger haywire prices again next
summer. No one, including FERC commissioners, is certain that proposed
fixes will not worsen things.
<p>"Markets are complex, and they move in counterintuitive ways," said
Camden Collins, a former PUC staff member who played a key role in
deregulation. "We've got to steer a straight course, because it's in the
careening that you spend billions of dollars."
<p>As politicians and regulators scramble for solutions, the vast
majority of Californians, numbed by the complexity of the power system
and insulated by rate freezes, are just waking to the aftermath of
deregulation.
<p>A Los Angeles Times poll of nearly 2,000 people in late October found
that 47% disapproved of the Legislature's 1996 passage of deregulation,
while 32% supported it.
<p>"Markets do work," said Judah Rose, senior vice president of ICF
Consulting, a Virginia energy consulting group. "Just give it a chance."
<p>"There is an unbelievable wave of [power plant] construction sweeping
every part of the country," he said. "You guys are a little bit behind. .
. . You've got to have some price spikes to encourage people to build."
<p>But the debate eventually works its way back to the pocketbook, where
regulators and politicians must face the grandmothers who scrimped on
groceries to pay the electricity bill.
<p>"If you believe in markets," said Bill Eastlake, an economist with the
Idaho Public Utilities Commission, "you can't blanch at the sight of
victims."

<p>Before Deregulation
</b>
<p>Before California deregulated its electricity industry in March 1998,
three big privately owned utilities delivered 80% of the electricity
consumed in the state. State regulators set the rates the utilities could
charge.
<br>
<center>
* * *
</center>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After Deregulation
<p>Utilities sold their power plants to private companies. The new
owners, as well as dozens of other electricity producers and brokers, now
sell their electricity in a computer-based marketplace called the
California Power Exchange. Some electricity is also purchased through the
California Independent System Operator, whose primary function is to
stabilize the flow of electricity.
