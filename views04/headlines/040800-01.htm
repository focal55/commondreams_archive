Adam Eidinger is one of those thousands of young politicos who roam Washington, an American University graduate who has worked in Congress and for the last three years at a well-known Democratic consulting firm.

</font>Until last Monday. Eidinger was fired from Rabinowitz Media, where he admits he blurred the lines between his daytime job and his nighttime politics.
<P>"I've been laughed at in the office for so long, with people saying I'm too idealistic, you have to work in the system," said the Pittsburgh native. "But I've tried all that. It's time to try something else."</P>
<P>Eidinger, 26, is one of scores of activists helping to organize a mass protest next weekend aimed at shutting down meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank--demonstrations that take their direct inspiration from last fall's raucous rallies against the World Trade Organization in Seattle.</P>
<P>This movement has many faces. There is the 20-year veteran of ignored leftist causes who is now part of a movement mobilizing thousands on their way to Washington. There is the Kenyan champion of internationalist issues; the Baltimore boy turned Berkeley agitator; the earnest employee of a Washington think tank who got her start organizing Greenpeace meetings in her suburban high school.</P>
<P>All share a passionate contempt for the World Bank, the IMF and other global financial institutions, which they accuse of aiding transnational corporations at the expense of the poor and the environment. And all have spent much of the last three months in basements and meeting rooms throughout the District with one aim: to re-create the triumphant "Battle in Seattle" in the nation's capital.</P>
<P>Caravans of buses, cars and bicycles are expected to start arriving today, carrying thousands of aging hippies, doe-eyed college students, devoted anarchists and myriad other opponents of global capitalism. Organizers have even found some support among area high school students.</P>
<P>Unlike the pivotal rallies in Seattle, which were spearheaded by activists on the West Coast, the Mobilization for Global Justice on April 16 and 17 has in many ways been a Washington affair--drawing key volunteers from the network of leftist think tanks, association headquarters and political consulting firms in and around Capitol Hill.</P>
<P>In a town teeming with climbers and strivers, the organization maintains that no one is in charge. Members take pains to credit others with helping the cause, endorsing a consensus-driven process that includes a dizzying number of committees and subcommittees set up to get things done.</P>
<P>Amy Quinn, who is helping arrange forums and teach-ins for the week leading up to the rally, puts a fine point on it: "There are no leaders; there are people with leadership skills."</P>
<P>Yet there are several dozen activists, most Washington-based, who have played key roles in organizing the demonstrations. They have scheduled scores of meetings, recruited and trained adherents, arranged for food, shelter and medical care, run interference with police and lobbied for news media coverage.</P>
<P>Their roots are in the varied causes and activities of the left, from the nuclear protests of the 1970s to the pro-Sandinista organizing of the 1980s to the counterculture presidential campaign of Ralph Nader. Most share an abiding distrust of corporations, governments and media, and some draw on painful experiences or idealistic parents for inspiration.</P>
<P>Some are like Eidinger, a talkative Adams-Morgan resident who, as a member of the organization's "media working group," serves as a liaison with the press.</P>
<P>His father, an electrician, and his mother, a state government worker, have been active unionists in Pittsburgh, a city buffeted by the steady loss of steel jobs to overseas companies. Eidinger recalls watching from his bedroom window in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood as Homestead, once the world's largest mill, was methodically torn down. He watched the size of his classes dwindle as residents fled; few friends still live in Pittsburgh.</P>
<P>Eidinger sees a clear connection between his home town's troubles and the policies of the IMF and World Bank, which he accuses of encouraging low-wage, nonunion factories in the developing world.</P>
<P>He wears Puma sneakers because they were made in the Czech Republic instead of countries with worse labor records. His first official act of civil disobedience came last year, when he was arrested outside a banquet dressed as an oversized caricature of Bill Clinton. His dream project: to help unionize fast-food workers.</P>
<P>"We want to make sure that before we sell out the American worker, we have global standards for labor and the environment," he said. He sees the upcoming rallies this way: "This is a citizen strike."</P>
<P>His former boss, Steve Rabinowitz, said he admires Eidinger's commitment--if not his beliefs--and both stress that their parting was amicable.</P>
<P>"I tease him that he still thinks he's in college, when we were all more liberal or conservative than we came to be in the real world," said Rabinowitz, a former Clinton aide. "I admire his conviction, and I know this is where his political heart is. But to me, he continues to be extremely, often naively, liberal."</P>
<P>If Eidinger is one of the movement's young Turks, Nadine Bloch is one of its veterans.</P>
<P>A fixture in leftist politics for 20 of her 38 years, the Connecticut native and Takoma Park resident holds a boat captain's license and is an avid climber who has been arrested at numerous protests from Des Moines to New Jersey. While working for Greenpeace in 1994, for example, she and her compatriots scaled Manhattan's 47-story Time-Life skyscraper to protest the firm's use of bleached paper.</P>
<P>In Washington, where she has lived and worked for a decade now, Bloch has become adept at organizing "guerrilla theater," making larger-than-life, Mardi Gras-style puppets of the type that will swarm the capital in coming days. She is also a key instigator behind the Washington Action Group (WAG), which garnered a lot of attention with its "Wag the Dog" drill corps protesting the bombings in Iraq.</P>
<P>"A big visual, a huge evil-looking corporate puppet, can be worth a thousand words," said Bloch, who hasn't let pregnancy slow down her work on the IMF-World Bank protest. "This is all about building a movement. One of the ways you build a movement is to reach out to people in ways they can understand."</P>
<P>Bloch's deep ties to the environmental movement are almost a pedigree for this effort. Groups such as Greenpeace, Earth First! and the Rainforest Action Network figure prominently on the resumes of many organizers. Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University history professor who studies mass protest movements, said environmentalism has become the chief training ground for activists on numerous leftist issues.</P>
<P>"After the 1960s and 1970s, most of the left fragmented into identity movements around sexual identity, feminism and race," Kazin said. "Environmentalism was really the only cause that was still universal, like the early civil rights and anti-war movements."</P>
<P>It was environmentalism that got Quinn started as an activist. As a high school student in suburban Providence, R.I., Quinn often gathered classmates for Greenpeace or Amnesty International meetings, she said.</P>
<P>A decade later, she is still putting together meetings, this time as a field organizer for the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive downtown think tank. For the mobilization event, Quinn has amassed a schedule of more than 40 forums, "teach-ins" and other meetings focused on issues and policy.</P>
<P>Unlike some others in this movement, Quinn's calling is a puzzle to her family. She said that both her brothers are bankers and that neither of her parents was particularly political when she was growing up.</P>
<P>"I can't identify any one particular point where everything clicked or changed for me," she said. "I've just always had a leaning toward it."</P>
<P>For Njoki Njoroge Njehu, though, social causes are a family thing. A feminist and environmentalist, Njehu watched her mother work on numerous issues as a community organizer in her native Kenya, particularly focusing on helping poor women get access to food and education.</P>
<P>Njehu is now director of 50 Years Is Enough, a Capitol Hill group that was formed by various environmental organizations to specifically campaign against the World Bank and IMF. The post gave Njehu an obvious role in the upcoming protest, which she describes as "the point we've always wanted to reach."</P>
<P>"My mother is the one who set me on this path," said Njehu, 34, who came to the United States to attend college in 1986. "Her work on the environment and women's rights is why I'm here today."</P>
<P>Indeed, in the forging of many of these activists, childhood and parents often play a crucial part. Han Shan, 27, grew up in North Baltimore, the son of a men's store employee and a nurse. Neither was particularly political, he said, but their day-to-day struggles to get by set him on the road to the Ruckus Society, a Berkeley, Calif.-based group that offers forest camps to train activists in nonviolent protest.</P>
<P>"I saw my folks struggling and not getting a lot of happiness in what I saw as their main goals in life, which were getting a new car and a nicer house and that sort of thing," said the former art student, who has been in Washington for weeks preparing for the protest. "It made me question very early on the whole American dream and materialism."</P>
<P>The search for answers led first to Chicago, where the avid oil painter graduated from art college, and eventually to Missoula, Mont., where he first attended a Ruckus camp on how to climb trees, blockade roads and engage in sophisticated forms of protest. "I found my home," he said.</P>
<P>A decade after leaving Baltimore, he now has a full-time job at Ruckus and a Chinese name, given to him by his Buddhist teacher. He said his parents, a Quaker and a Catholic in their upbringings, don't entirely understand his lifestyle but are supportive.</P>
<P>"For the most part, what I do is not a part of their world," he said. He declined to reveal his original name. "But they do have a general middle-class understanding that government generally doesn't work for them and that corporations aren't looking out for their interests. I guess they're the kind of people we hope to reach."</P>
<P>There are many in the movement who, like him, are wanderers of a sort, searching for contentment and finding it in the politics of the left. Matthew Smucker, 22, has already gone far in his few years of adulthood, setting out from conservative Lancaster, Pa., and ending up in Minneapolis, where he works the counter at a leftist cooperative restaurant called the Seward Cafe.</P>
<P>His passions are local struggles: While police clashed with protesters and vandals in Seattle, Smucker was participating in rallies against a highway in Minneapolis. But he finds parallels. Much like that highway, he said, the policies of the IMF and World Bank run roughshod over the interests of communities around the world.</P>
<P>So Smucker arrived in Washington six weeks ago to help with the effort as a contracted representative of the Rainforest Action Network.</P>
<P>"There's a general feeling that we're no longer in control of the basic decisions that govern our lives, that corporations are making all the decisions," Smucker said. "There's a hollowness there. . . . I've just been sort of swept up in the movement."</P>
