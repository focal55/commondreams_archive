BARRANCABERMEJA, Colombia (AP) - Hard-eyed men with Uzis stood
guard as Sen. Paul Wellstone stepped out of a helicopter and into a
bulletproof car and drove to a meeting with human rights activists.
Hours earlier, police said they discovered a bomb along the airport
road.
<p>U.S. and Colombian authorities Friday downplayed the possibility
that Wellstone and U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson, who accompanied
the Minnesota Democrat, were the intended targets of the bomb.
Their visit marked the first time a U.S. lawmaker or ambassador had
come to the deadliest town in all the Americas - a sweltering
cluster of cinderblock homes on the banks of the muddy Magdalena
River.
<p>There was heavy security for the U.S. officials during their
three-hour visit Thursday. But Barrancabermeja's 195,000 residents
have no such protection: this year alone, 470 of them have been
slain in politically motivated attacks, human rights workers say.
Massacres are commonplace, and the killers are rarely caught.
<p>Wellstone said he made the perilous journey to show support for
the human rights activists, who face immense risk.
<p>``I don't know whether I was targeted, but I certainly know that
the human rights activists are targeted,'' Wellstone told an
airport news conference on his return to Minneapolis on Friday.
<p>For Wellstone, a former civil rights activist and college
professor, his two-day visit to Colombia also was aimed at making a
stand against Plan Colombia, a drug-eradication effort being funded
by $1.3 billion from Washington. Under the plan, dozens of
U.S.-donated combat helicopters will ferry U.S.-trained Colombian
troops into cocaine-producing plantations to seize them from
insurgents.
<p>But while the military is being strengthened, Wellstone says
there is no firm plan to provide coca farmers with alternative
livelihoods. He fears they will then be driven into the ranks of
leftist guerrillas or the rival right-wing paramilitary group, the
United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC.
<p>Moreover, Wellstone is concerned that President Clinton 
authorized delivery of the aid even though the Colombian government
has not met all the human rights conditions set by Congress. Among
outstanding concerns is that the Colombian military has not severed
its links to the AUC. The paramilitaries, responsible for numerous
massacres of suspected guerrilla sympathizers, remain allied with
the army in the field in anti-guerrilla operations. Many AUC gunmen
are former government soldiers.
<p>``If we continue to waive the (human rights) provisions of the
aid package, then the message we are sending to the paramilitaries
and the military is that human rights is not important to us,''
Wellstone told The Associated Press as he flew to Barrancabermeja.
<p>Wellstone said he asked President Andres Pastrana on Wednesday
for the government to bring paramilitary leaders to trial and
protect human rights workers. Human rights workers whom Wellstone
met with said the AUC was responsible for most of the killings in
Barrancabermeja, 155 miles north of the capital, Bogota.
<p>There were questions, meanwhile, about who was the intended
target of the bomb, and its location. Barrancabermeja's police
commander said the bomb was found on the road from the airport to
the city. However, local journalists who witnessed the device being
dismantled said it was found in a neighborhood far from the
highway. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the two
reports.
<p>The White House said it did not view Wellstone and Patterson as
targets and State Department officials said it wasn't unusual for
such devices to be found in Barrancabermeja. Colombian police said
first that it appeared to be an assassination attempt, and then
later said it did not. Police said a man they arrested in
connection with the case, whom they identified as a member of the
rebel National Liberation Army, was not telling them who the
intended target was. Many residents of Barrancabermeja knew of the planned visit by
the U.S. delegation. But security forces had kept confidential
plans to transfer the party from the airport to the town by
helicopter.
<p>Earlier Thursday, Wellstone and Patterson flew aboard a Black
Hawk combat helicopter to observe a raid by heavily armed Colombian
national police on a plantation near the village of Taraza, 220
miles northwest of Bogota.
<p>Huddled on the mountainside, 32 coca harvesters - itinerant
workers who pull the leaves off the bushes and work in a
rudimentary processing lab for $4 to $5 per day - watched as police
torched the lab. It was quickly enveloped in flames, sending a
plume of black smoke over the jungle-covered mountains and a blast
of intense heat that could be felt 100 yards away.
<p>Jorge Perez, a 24-year-old father of two, took a deep drag off
his cigarette and shook his head.
<p>``Now we'll be without work,'' Perez said. ``Working the coca
fields is the only way to make money around here.''
