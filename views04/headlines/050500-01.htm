WASHINGTON - May 4   - Following the outcries against
genetically engineered crops, environmental groups are beginning
to take aim at plans underway to alter the genes of trees grown
for pulp and paper products. 
<P>
While forest-related biotech research is still in its infancy
compared with that taking place in agriculture, field trials of GM
trees have proliferated around the world during the second half of
the 1990s.  
<P>
Now environmentalists are starting to pay attention to research
links made between large biotechnology companies and the paper and
pulp industry to develop faster growing trees that could be
designed to work together with herbicides. 
<P>
Ecologists worry that the drive for profit is causing these
companies to overlook the overall impact genetically modified
trees could have on the complex workings of ecosystems.  
<P>
The economic incentive for these companies to produce trees more
quickly cannot be overemphasised, say groups which estimate the
value of the world's total annual timber harvest is in excess of
400 billion dollars.  
<P>
Environmentalists fear, for example, that new GM traits - such as
herbicide resistance - could possibly spread to other trees
through
cross fertilisation. This could cause certain trees to take over
ecosystems and cause other native species to go extinct.  
<P>
''We feel that this is a very dangerous trend in industrial
forestry and a real threat to bio-diversity, forest ecosystems and
the planet,'' says Patrick Reinsborough, outreach co-ordinator for
the California-based Rainforest Action Network.  
<P>
Last April, Monsanto Company (expected to merge with Pharmacia
Upjohn), hooked up with International Paper, Westvaco Corporation
(both based in New York) and the New Zealand-based Fletcher
Challenge Forests to form a forestry biotechnology joint venture.  
<P>
The four companies will contribute 60 million dollars over five
years to produce and market tree seedlings that they say will
improve forest health and productivity. 
<P>
Researchers will focus on altering the genetic traits of tree
species commonly planted by the forest industry worldwide, such as
eucalyptus, poplar, radiata pine, loblolly pine and sweetgum
trees, say the companies.  
<P>
Besides increasing the growth rates of tree, they plan to also
focus on making these trees tolerant to certain herbicides, much
like Monsanto's 'Round-up Ready' soy beans which are genetically
designed to survive sprayings of an herbicide it manufactures.  
<P>
They say they will also aim to improve the fibre quality and
uniformity to increase efficiency in paper and wood products
manufacturing processes.  
<P>
''Increasing the productivity of tree plantations safely and
sustainably will help meet the world's wood and fibre needs
without
increasing pressure on native forests,'' says a statement released
by Westvaco.  
<P>
But environmental groups say that just like biologically modified
corn and soy, not all the possible impacts of genetically altering
trees have been adequately studied and tested. 
<P>
''The use of genetically engineered trees intensifies the many
concerns about the use of genetically engineered crops,'' says
Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist with Environmental Defense, a
Washington-based group critical of the technology.  
<P>
Since trees grown uniformly on plantations for paper and pulp are
often nearby natural native forests, environmentalists fear that
cross pollination will be very likely. 
<P>
Goldburg says that pollen from trees are known to travel great
distances by the wind.  
<P>
''Buffer zones'' of 50 or so metres - intended to shield
traditional crops and native trees from genetically modified
pollen - as advocated by biotech companies are inadequate given
that pollen from some pine trees have been known to travel
hundreds of kilometres, she says.  
<P>
One of the proposed gene altering strategies to increase tree
growth rates involves shutting off the tree's ability to reproduce
so that all the organism's energy goes towards development instead
of fertility. If traits affecting reproduction escape to wild
trees whole species could be jeopardised, warn groups. 
<P>
''The risks of genetic pollution in our remaining native forests
are irreversible and potentially one of the greatest threats to
bio-diversity ever,'' says Mick Petrie, a campaigner with the
Native Forest Network (NFN), an advocacy group based in the state
of Vermont.  
<P>
According to NFN, companies can now alter trees to substantially
reduce lignin, a component of the cell walls in trees and other
plants that is essential for the structure of the plant, aiding in
strength and vascular functions.  
<P>
Pulp and paper companies must remove the lignin from wood pulp to
make paper. But now researchers have devised a way to genetically
disrupt a tree's production of lignin.  
<P>
''The actual processes that form lignin are poorly understood, and
how diminished production of essential enzymes within may affect
other functions is unknown,'' says NFN, in a recent newsletter to
its members. Because lignin is essential to a tree's strength,
lowering lignin could adversely affect a tree's ability to
withstand wind without damage, says the group. 
<P>
''Escape of low-lignin genes into the wild is a significant worry,
and could have devastating consequences on native forests,'' it
says.The altering of lignin production underlies that more
research is required to fill gaps in the understanding of tree
biology and ecology, say environmentalists. 
<P>
Trees are very complex organisms. Recent studies, for example,
revealed that some trees, when attacked by caterpillars, release a
chemical warning to surrounding trees, which alter the chemical
structure of their leaves to be unappealing to the caterpillars.  
<P>
''How will altering gene codes affect these and other little
understood behaviours? '' asks NFN.  
<P>
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says that trees - unlike crops - can
take
up to hundreds of years to fully mature and are therefore subject
to a much wider range of environmental stresses, and these
stresses can in turn affect the behaviour of the modified genome. 
<P>
''At present, nobody can confidently quantify the environmental
risks surrounding genetically modified trees,'' the group says in
a report on genetically modified trees published last year.  
<P>
Given all of the unknowns, WWF is urging governments to declare a
moratorium on the commercial release of GM trees and encouraging
the industrial forest sector to do the same voluntarily. 
<P>
While calling for government regulators of biotechnology to better
consult with environmental organisations, WWF is also prodding the
paper and biotechnology industries to redesign field trials to
examine broader environmental impacts.  
<P>
''Any decision as to whether biotechnology has a role in
commercial
forestry should only be made once the risks involved are properly
identified and quantified,'' says WWF.
