WASHINGTON  - Lawyers for victims of human rights
abuses committed
by the military regime in Burma claim that the Republican Party's
vice
presidential nominee was involved in a company that assisted in
energy
projects
in Burma associated with violent human rights abuses.

</font></font></td>

</TABLE></font>Until he was selected as vice presidential candidate for the
Republican
ticket,
Dick Cheney headed the energy giant Halliburton, which activists
say owned a
subsidiary which helped construct two pipelines that involved the
forcible
relocation of villages, forced labour, rape and murder. 
<P>
''Halliburton partners and subsidiaries, both before and during
Dick Cheney's
tenure as CEO, have been contractors for pipeline projects that
have led to
crimes against humanity in Burma,'' says Katie Redford, a human
rights lawyer
with EarthRights. 
<P>
The military government in Burma, also known as Myanmar, has long
been
considered one of the world's most abusive regimes. The United
States and the
European Union have imposed economic sanctions against the country
due to the
military's human rights abuses. 
<P>
The regime is holding Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whose
political
party swept national elections 10 years ago with more than 80
percent of the
vote, under house arrest. 
<P>
With western countries blocking substantial economic assistance
from the World
Bank and other multilateral financial institutions, the regime has
been forced
to rely on foreign investment in order to earn hard currency. 
<P>
Two such investment projects are the Yadana and Yetagun pipelines.
The 1.2
billion-dollar Yadana pipeline will pump natural gas from off-
shore fields in
the Andaman Sea through Burma to Thailand. Construction began in
1992 and was
completed last year. 
<P>
Lawyers with EarthRights have gathered testimony from more than
100 villagers
and several alleged army deserters who claimed to be victims or
witnesses of
abuses related to the army's security operations in the pipeline. 
<P>
Activists are demanding that the consortium operating the
pipeline, including
French oil giant Total, US-based Union Oil of California (Unocal),
and a Thai
state owned company, withdraw from the project and Burma
altogether. 
<P>
Redford and other lawyers for victims of human rights abuses
committed by the
military regime in Burma are appealing a Los Angeles judge's
recent ruling
that they cannot sue California-based Unocal which allegedly knew about
and
benefited directly from the regime's conduct. 
<P>
In the case, 'John Doe et al versus Unocal et al,' the lawyers
argued that the
company should be held liable for abuses committed by the army
which,
according
to their legal theory, acted as paid agents of Unocal and other
members of the
consortium. 
<P>
On Aug. 31, US District Judge Ronald Lew found that evidence had
been
presented
that Unocal knew or should have known about human rights abuses
committed in
connection with the project and that these acts benefited the
project.  
<P>
But, the judge concluded even if that were all proven in court,
the plaintiffs
would have to show that Unocal was much more involved. 
<P>
If the case proceeds, it could have major implications for recent
efforts by
the
United Nations and other international groups to promote codes of
conduct for
companies operating in developing countries. 
<P>
While activists appeal the ruling, Washington-based EarthRights is
now taking
aim at Halliburton whose subsidiary European Marine Contractors,
in a joint
venture with the Italian company Saipem, helped lay the offshore
portion of
the Yadana pipeline in 1996 and 1997, according to a new report by the
advocacy
group. 
<P>
Cheney was CEO of Halliburton during this time. Halliburton Energy
Services
also provided pre-commissioning services to the Yadana pipeline
with the help
of
the British company, Alfred McAlpine, according to the 42-page
report
released
here Wednesday. 
<P>
Human rights activists also connect Halliburton with a second
pipeline, the
Yetagun, which was constructed parallel to the Yadana pipeline.
EarthRights
claims that Bredero-Shaw, a subsidiary for Dresser Industries
manufactured
the
coating for the Yetagun pipeline in 1998. Dresser was purchased by
Halliburton
that same year. 
<P>
EarthRights has documentation that the Yetagun pipeline is
associated with
the
same pattern of human rights abuse as reported against the Yadana
pipeline.
''To be involved in the Yetagun project is to knowingly accept
brutal
violations of human rights as part of doing business,'' says
Redford. 
<P>
In response to criticism, last month Halliburton spokeswoman Wendy
Hall said
''we don't do business in Burma.'' 
<P>
Cheney announced early last month that he would forfeit some
options in
Halliburton if the Republican ticket is elected. He has already
sold a large
part of his holding in the energy company. 
<P>
EarthRights also outlines some of Halliburton's other activities
in Indonesia,
Iran, Iraq, Libya and Nigeria. 
<P>
One of the company's contracts with Indonesia was cancelled by the
government
during a purging of corruptly awarded contracts. An Indonesian
corporate
watchdog organisation called Halliburton's engineering division,
Kellogg Brown
and Root among 59 companies that used ''collusive, corruptive and
nepotistic
practices'' with former president Suharto's family, according to
EarthRights. 
<P>
In Nigeria, Halliburton was accused of complicity in the shooting  
of a 
protestor  
by Nigeria's Mobile Police Unit. 
<P>
EarthRights also documents Halliburton's strong involvement in USA- 
Engage and 
the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), two powerful industry  
groups that 
lobby against US sanctions. 
<P>
Last June, the Supreme Court sided with the NFTC which fought  
against the 
Massachusetts Burma law that prohibited state money from employing  
or 
contracting with companies that work in Burma. 
<P>
Pro-democracy Burmese groups and US human rights activists  
compared the 
selective purchasing law with those laws that helped bring down  
apartheid in 
South Africa in the 1980s.  
<P>
The NFTC argued that states should not be able to steer money away  
from Burma 
dictatorship because the federal government has already enacted  
sanction  
against Burma that pre-empt state laws. 
<P>
Dick Cheney signed an amicus brief against the Massachusetts law,  
according 
to  
the EarthRights report. Like Unocal corporate officers, he argued  
that 
sanctions do not work and that what is needed is so-called  
''constructive 
engagement' with  
governments accused of abuses. 
<P>
But Redford says the term constructive engagement is a smokescreen  
and what  
is really behind Halliburton's and the NFTC's agenda is commercial  
interests. 
<P>
''The real reason is they don't want to lose the business for  
themselves,'' 
she says.
