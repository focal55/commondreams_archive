WASHINGTON, May 23 -- The 
Clinton administration has quietly 
resumed military cooperation with 
Indonesia, senior defense officials 
said today, eight months after cutting off those ties following massacres in East Timor.

<p> The United States broke the freeze 
this month by inviting Indonesian 
military observers to joint exercises 
in Thailand and by completing plans 
this week to hold the first joint exercises between American and Indonesian armed forces in July.

<p> These exercises are a prelude to a 
much larger military-to-military 
program the administration will 
present Congress this month to reward the new, democratically elected Indonesian government for removing some of the senior military 
officers under investigation for the 
East Timor massacres and for imposing civilian control of the military, according to senior administration officials.

<p> Since taking office seven months 
ago, President Abdurrahman Wahid 
has named a civilian minister of defense and removed General Wiranto, 
the powerful chief of the armed 
forces, who is under investigation for 
allowing several army units to orchestrate last year's rampage in 
East Timor, which left hundreds 
dead after the province voted for 
independence from Indonesia.

<p> But some members of Congress 
and human rights groups are critical 
of resuming any relations with the 
military until the current investigations into the massacres and other 
human rights abuses in East Timor 
lead to trials of senior officers.

<p> Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, will propose 
legislation as early as this week to 
prolong the freeze on military relations until the officers are all put on 
trial.

<p> And a group of 29 human rights 
organizations has petitioned Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright 
to prevent any "resumption of military engagement at any level."

<p> "I really do think it is premature 
for the Pentagon to be resuming cooperation when there has been a lack 
of accountability for the senior officers," said Michael Jendrzejczyk of 
Human Rights Watch, which signed 
the letter to Dr. Albright. 

<p> President Clinton suspended all 
military ties with Indonesia in September when General Wiranto failed 
to reign in the local militia as it 
rampaged through East Timor. And 
in its report issued earlier this year, 
the United Nations said its investigation uncovered evidence that special 
forces of the Indonesian army did 
"support the militias in intimidation 
and terror attacks" in East Timor.

<p> To avoid working with those units, 
the Pentagon is renewing its ties first 
with the Indonesia's air force and 
navy. The joint exercises this summer will be held with Indonesian 
marines and will concentrate on humanitarian assistance and disaster 
relief, according to a senior defense 
official.

<p> "What better way than to take 
some first steps towards re-engagement with humanitarian exercises 
and with the  services that don't have 
a cloud over them," said a senior 
official who asked for anonymity.

<p>  After consultations with Congress, 
the administration hopes to begin 
what Dr. Albright described in a letter to the human rights groups as a 
"carefully calibrated" program to 
renew ties with the two militaries.

<p>     "Given where Indonesia was a 
year ago, this government has made 
tremendous progress in asserting civilian control over the military," 
said Adam Schwarz, the author of "A 
Nation in Waiting: Indonesia's 
Search for Stability," (Westview 
Press, 1994).
