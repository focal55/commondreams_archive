Bowing to Japanese concerns about a string
of incidents involving American troops stationed on
Okinawa, United States military authorities on the
Japanese island have this week imposed an indefinite
curfew and alcohol ban on members of all its armed
forces stationed there.

<p>The ban comes less than a week before the three-day
G-7 summit meeting on the island, scheduled to start
on July 12, and less than two weeks ahead of US
President Bill Clinton's visit to the island for the
G-8 international summit on July 21-23. He will be the
first US leader to go to Okinawa since the island,
captured during World War II, was returned to Japan in
1972.

<p>The recent incidents have encouraged opponents of the
American bases on Okinawa, who had been concerned that
a July 20 protest rally would not draw enough people
to circle Kadena Air Base. Until recently, Okinawan
officials were taking great pains to separate the
summit from the base issue.

<p>Last week, a 19-year-old US Marine was arrested on
charges of indecency and unlawful entry after he
allegedly walked into an unlocked apartment in Okinawa
City at night, crawled into the bed of a 14-year-old
girl and fondled her. The unidentified Marine, who was
apparently drunk, was arrested after the girl's mother
discovered her daughter screaming and called police.
The Marine later said he wanted to visit a friend and
entered the wrong house by mistake.

<p>The incident triggered a wave of protest that's hardly
likely to subside before the G-7 and G-8 meetings get
underway. Afterwards, Japan was treated to the sight
of Lieutenant-General Earl Hailston of the United
States Marine Corps, the highest-ranking American
officer on Okinawa, bowing deeply to the prefecture's
governor in a striking display of contrition.

<p>Early Sunday morning, a US Air Force staff sergeant
was involved in a hit-and-run accident at the United
States Air Force's Kadena Air Base that left an
Okinawan pedestrian injured. The sergeant was later
caught. The authorities investigating the accident
said it appeared that alcohol was involved.

<p>The US Ambassador to Japan, Thomas Foley, visited
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in Tokyo on Monday to
offer his regrets for the behaviour of US service
members on Okinawa. "I have come to express to you my
profound regret for the events in Okinawa, and to tell
you that steps have been taken so this won't happen
again," Foley said, according to Japanese news
reports.

<p>After the first incident, the provincial parliament in
Naha, Okinawa's capital, promptly issued a unanimous
protest against "the frequent crimes of the US
soldiers" which "strongly disturb and shock the people
of the prefecture of Okinawa." At a Saturday protest
outside the Marine Corps headquarters, members of a
women's civic group recalled an incident five years
ago in which three US servicemen were convicted of
abducting a 12-year-old girl from a supermarket and
repeatedly raping her. The three were tried by a
Japanese court. Two of them were sentenced to seven
years in prison, the third to six and a half years.

<p>The behaviour of US service members stationed on
Okinawa remains unchanged since that incident, claimed
the group's leader, Naha city assemblywoman Suzuyo
Takazato as cited in the Japan Times, adding, "The
best and only way to solve such a problem is to make
the islands free of military bases." "Okinawa is
sitting atop a pool of molten lava," Governor Keiichi
Inamine told the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper, "and
it can explode at any minute." "I have never before
heard the word bakuhatsu (explosion) as often as I did
during visit ," said Kenzaburo Oe, winner of the Nobel
Prize for literature, in an eight-part series for
Asahi Shimbun. If the authorities take a hard-line
stance, he said, simmering public outrage could boil
over in a number of different forms - in a worst-case
scenario, perhaps even in the form of bloody clashes
between US troops and members of the Japanese
Self-Defence Force.

<p>About 26,000 of the 48,000 American military personnel
in Japan are stationed in Okinawa or elsewhere in the
Ryukyu Islands, along with about an equal number of
American civilian employees - well over 50,000 all
told. The 39 military bases there, which occupy more
than 10 per cent of the island's area, have been bones
of contention since the 1960 signing of a new Japanese
security treaty in Washington.

<p>Minutes and notes also signed at the same time
excluded Ryukyu and Bonin Islands from the area the
new treaty covered. That agreement has been
continuously extended even after the United States
returned the rest of the islands to Japan in 1972.

<p>In 1996, US President Clinton promised to return the
American base at Futenma to Japan, but current plans
just call for relocating the American facility to
Nago, where a new airbase is also planned.

<p>Okinawa's protest movement had an effect on Japan's
parliamentary elections in June. Mitsuku Tomon,
57-year-old former deputy governor of Okinawa and an
outspoken opponent of the American bases, won one of
the island's three seats in parliament. The recent
reduction of tension in Korea, a subject due for
discussion at the G-7 summit, eliminates the need for
stationing US Marines and Air Force planes on Okinawa,
according to the local peace movement. A columnist
writing in the Los Angeles Times recently said that
North Korea is not as big a problem now as the "rogue
superpower America."
