EL SALADO, Colombia -- The armed men, more 
than 300 of them, marched into this tiny village early 
on a Friday. They went straight to the basketball 
court that doubles as the main square, residents said, 
announced themselves as members of Colombia's 
most feared right-wing paramilitary group, and with 
a list of names began summoning residents for 
judgment.

<p>   A table and chairs were taken  from a house, and 
after the death squad leader had made himself 
comfortable, the basketball court was turned into a 
court of execution, villagers said. The paramilitary 
troops ordered liquor and music, and then embarked 
on a calculated rampage of torture, rape and killing.

Pieces of a table used by members of a death squad and other reminders remain scattered on a basketball court where residents of El Salado were summoned, judged and executed. During three days in February, survivors say, members of the right-wing paramilitary group executed people accused of helping left-wing guerrillas.<br>

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>"To them, it was like a big party," said one of a 
dozen survivors who described the scene in interviews this month. "They drank and danced and 
cheered as they butchered us like hogs."

<p>   By the time they left, late the following Sunday 
afternoon, they had killed at least 36 people whom 
they accused of collaborating with the enemy, left-wing guerrillas who have long been a presence in the 
area. The victims, for the most part, were men, but 
others ranged from a 6-year-old girl to an elderly 
woman. As music blared, some of the victims were 
shot after being tortured; others were stabbed or 
beaten to death, and several more were strangled.

<p>   Yet during the three days of killing last February, military and police units just a few miles away 
made no effort to stop the slaughter, witnesses said. 
At one point, they said, the paramilitaries had a 
helicopter flown in to rescue a fighter who had been 
injured trying to drag some victims from their home.

<p> Instead of fighting back, the armed forces set up 
a roadblock on the way to the village shortly after the 
rampage began, and prevented human rights and 
relief groups from entering and rescuing residents.

<p> While the Colombian military has opened three 
investigations into what happened here and has made 
some arrests of paramilitaries, top military officials 
insist that fighting was under way in the village 
between guerrillas and paramilitary forces -- not a 
series of executions. They also insist that the colonel 
in charge of the region has been persecuted by 
government prosecutors and human rights groups. 
Last month he was promoted to general, even though 
examinations of the incidents are pending.

<p>     What happened in El Salado last February -- at 
the same time that President Clinton was pushing an 
aid package to step up antidrug efforts here -- goes to 
the heart of the debate over the growing American 
backing of the Colombian military. For years the 
United States government and human rights groups 
have had reservations about the Colombian military 
leadership, its human rights record and its collaboration with paramilitary units.

<p> The Colombian Armed Forces and police are the 
principal beneficiaries of a new $1.3 billion 
aid package from Washington. The Colombian government says it has been working 
hard to sever the remnants of ties between 
the armed forces and the paramilitaries and 
has been training its soldiers to observe 
international human rights conventions 
even during combat.

<p> "The paramilitaries are some of the 
worst of the terrorists who profit from 
drugs in Colombia, and in no way can anyone justify their human rights violations," 
said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White 
House drug policy director. But he said "the 
Colombian military is making dramatic improvements in its human rights record," 
and noted that the aid package includes 
"significant money, $46 million, for human 
rights training and implementation."

<p>  But human rights groups, pointing to incidents like the massacre here, say these links 
still exist and that mechanisms to monitor 
and punish commanders and units have had 
limited success at best.

<p>   "El Salado was the worst recorded massacre yet this year," said Andrew Miller, a 
Latin American specialist for Amnesty International USA, who spent the past year as 
an observer near here. "The Colombian 
Armed Forces, specifically the marines, 
were at best criminally negligent by not 
responding sooner to the attack. At worst, 
they were knowledgeable and complicit."

<p>   The paramilitary attack on El Salado 
killed more people and lasted longer than 
any other in Colombia this year. But in most 
other respects it was an operation so typical 
of the 5,500-member right-wing death squad 
that goes by the name of the Peasant Self-Defense of Colombia that the Colombian 
press treated it as just another atrocity.

<p> The paramilitary groups were founded in 
the early 1980's, mostly funded by agricultural interests to protect them from extortion and kidnapping by the left-wing guerrillas. The paramilitary groups were declared 
illegal over a decade ago, but have continued to operate, often with clandestine military support and intelligence, and in recent 
years have become increasingly involved in 
drug trafficking.

<p>   Over the past 18 months, more than 2,500 
people, most of them unarmed peasants in 
rural areas like this village in northern 
Colombia, have died in more than 500 attacks by what the Colombian government 
calls "illegal armed groups" involved in the 
country's 35-year-old civil conflict. And according to the government,  right-wing paramilitary groups are responsible for most of 
those killings.

<p>   Since the  El Salado massacre, nearly 
3,000 residents of the area  have fled to 
nearby towns, including El Carmen de Bol&#0237;var and Ovejas, as well as the provincial 
capital, Cartagena. Early this month, more 
than a dozen of the survivors were interviewed in the towns where they have taken 
refuge under the protection of human rights 
groups or the Roman Catholic Church.

<p>   Despite efforts to protect them, however, 
some  have recently been killed in individual 
attacks or have disappeared, actions for 
which the same paramilitary group that 
attacked their village has been blamed. As a 
result, all of the survivors interviewed for 
this story spoke on condition that their 
names not be used.

<p>   Their accounts, however, coincide with 
investigations conducted by the Colombian 
government prosecutor's office and by the 
Colombia office of the United Nations high 
commissioner for human rights.

<p>   Members of a paramilitary unit had attacked this village in 1997, killing five people 
and warning that they would eventually 
come back. Many residents fled then, but 
returned after a few months believing that 
they were safe until the death squad suddenly reappeared on the morning of Feb. 18.

<p>   "I looked up at the hills, and could see 
armed men everywhere, blocking every 
possible exit," a farmer recalled. "They had 
surrounded the town, and almost as soon as 
they came down, they began firing their 
guns and shouting, 'Death to the guerrillas.' "

<p>   The death squad troops, almost all 
dressed in military-style uniforms with a 
blue patch, made their way to the basketball 
court at the center of the village. They took 
tables and chairs from a nearby building, 
pulled out a list of names and began the 
search for victims.

<p>   "Some people were shot, but a lot of them 
were beaten with clubs and then stabbed 
with knives or sliced up with machetes," one 
witness said. "A few people were beheaded, 
or strangled with metal wires, while others 
had their throats cut."

<p>   The list of those to be executed was supplied by two men, one of whom was wearing 
a ski mask. Paramilitary leaders, who have 
acknowledged the attack on El Salado but 
describe it as combat with  the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as 
the  FARC, later said that the two men were 
FARC deserters who had dealt with local 
people and knew who had been guerrilla 
sympathizers.

<p>   "It was all done very methodically," one 
witness said. "Some people were brought to 
the basketball court, but were saved because someone would say, 'Not that one,' 
and they would be allowed to leave. But I 
saw a woman neighbor of mine, who I know 
had nothing at all to do with the guerrillas, 
knocked down with clubs and then stabbed 
to death."

<p>   While some paramilitaries searched for 
people to kill, others were breaking into 
shops and stealing beer, rum and whiskey. 
Before long, a macabre party atmosphere 
prevailed, with the paramilitaries setting up 
radios with dance music and ordering a 
local guitarist and accordionist to play.

<p>   In addition, a young waitress from a cantina adjoining the basketball court was ordered to keep a steady supply of liquor 
flowing. As the armed men grew drunk and 
rowdy, they repeatedly raped her, along 
with several other women, according to 
residents and human rights groups.

<p>   As night fell, some residents fled to the 
wooded hills above town. Others, however, 
stayed in their homes, afraid of being 
caught if they tried to escape, unable to 
move because they had small children, or 
convinced that they would not be harmed.

<p>   Saturday was more of the same. "All day 
long we could hear occasional bursts of 
gunfire, along with the screams and cries of 
those who were being tortured and killed," 
said a woman who had taken refuge in the 
hills with her small children.

<p>   Of the 36 people killed in town, 16 were 
executed at the basketball court. An additional 18 people were killed in the  countryside, residents and human rights workers 
said, and 17 more are still missing, making 
for a death toll that could be as high as 71.

<p>   By Friday afternoon, however, news of 
the slaughter had spread to El Carmen de 
Bol&#0237;var, about 15 miles away. Relatives of 
El Salado residents rushed to local police 
and military posts, but were rebuffed.

<p>   "We made a scandal and nearly caused a 
riot, we were so insistent," said a 40-year-old-man who had left El Salado early on 
Friday because he had business in town. 
"But they did nothing to help us."

<p>   Not only did the armed forces and the 
police not come to the aid of the villagers 
here, but the roadblock they set up prevented humanitarian aid from entering the village. Anyone seeking to enter the area was 
told the road was unsafe because it had been 
mined and that combat was going on between guerrilla and paramilitary units.

<p>      In a telephone interview, three Colombian 
Navy admirals said that residents of El 
Salado were accusing the military of complicity in the massacre because they had 
been coerced by guerrillas."  The roadblock 
was set up, they said, to prevent more 
deaths or injuries to civilians.

<p>   "At no point was there collaboration on 
our part, nor would we have permitted their 
passage" through the area, Adm. William 
Porras, the second in command of the Colombian Navy, said of the death squad unit. 
 "We never at any point were covering up 
for them or helping them, as all the subsequent investigations have shown."

<p>  But local residents, Colombian prosecutors investigating the massacre and human 
rights groups say there was no combat. 
Villagers say that the armed forces had not 
been in the center of El Salado recently, and 
that they had left the outlying areas a day 
before. Residents also say they had passed 
over the dirt road that Friday morning and 
there were no mines.

<p> "The army was on patrol for two or three 
days before the massacre took place, and 
then suddenly they disappeared," recalled a 
43-year-old tobacco farmer. "It can't be 
explained, and it seems very curious to me."

<p>   What has been established is that the 
villagers were simple peasants, and not the 
guerrillas the paramilitary leader says his 
troops were fighting. "It is quite clear that 
these were defenseless people and that what 
they were subjected to was not combat, but 
abuse and torture," said a foreign diplomat 
who has been investigating.

<p>   Residents said the paramilitaries felt so 
certain that government security forces 
would stay away that late on Friday they 
had a helicopter flown in. It landed in front 
of a church and picked up a death squad 
fighter who was injured when a family he 
was trying to drag out of their house to be 
taken to the basketball court resisted.

<p>   In a report published last February, Human Rights Watch found "detailed, abundant and compelling evidence of continuing 
close ties between the Colombian Army and 
paramilitary groups responsible for gross 
human rights violations." All told, "half of 
Colombia's 18  brigade-level units have documented links to paramilitary activity," the 
report concluded.

<p>   "Far from moving decisively to sever ties 
to paramilitaries, Human Rights Watch's 
evidence strongly suggests that Colombia's 
military high command has yet to take the 
necessary steps to accomplish this goal," 
the report stated.

<p>   At the time of the El Salado massacre, the 
senior military officer in this region was 
Col. Rodrigo Qui&#0241;ones C&#0225;rdenas, commander of the First Navy Brigade, who has since 
been promoted to general. As director of 
Naval Intelligence in the early 1990's, he 
was identified by Colombian prosecutors as 
the organizer of a paramilitary network 
responsible for the killings of 57 trade unionists, human rights workers and members of 
a left-wing political party.

<p>   In 1994, Colonel Qui&#0241;ones and seven other 
soldiers were charged with "conspiring to 
form or collaborate with armed groups." 
But after the main witness against him was 
killed in a maximum security prison and the 
case was moved from a civilian court to a 
military tribunal, the colonel was acquitted.

<p>   According to the same investigation by 
Colombian prosecutors, one of Colonel Qui&#0241;ones's closest associates in that paramilitary network was Harold Mantilla, a colonel 
in the Colombian Marines.

<p> Today, Colonel Mantilla is commander of 
the Fifth Marine Battalion, which operates 
in the area around El Salado and is one of 
the units said by residents and human rights 
workers to have failed to respond to appeals 
for help.

<p>   After the paramilitary unit left El Salado, 
the police captured 11 paramilitaries northeast of here on the ranch of a drug trafficker 
who is in prison in Bogot&#0225;. Along with four 
others who were arrested separately, they 
are facing murder charges, but their leaders and most of the others who carried out 
the killings remain free.

<p>   More than four months after the massacre, El Salado is virtually deserted. Only one 
of the town's 1,330 original residents was 
present when a reporter and human rights 
workers visited early this month, and he 
said the village remains as it was the day 
the death squad left, except for the two mass 
graves on a rise near the basketball court 
where the bodies  were buried and later 
exhumed for investigators.

<p>   The tables and chairs used by the paramilitary "judges," smashed or overturned 
as they left, are still strewn across the 
basketball court.

<p>   "I don't know if the people are ever going 
to want to come back again,"  the resident 
said. "What happened here was just too 
terrible to bear, and we didn't deserve it."
