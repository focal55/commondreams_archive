SANTIAGO, CHILE - Rural poverty has grown by 10 to 20
percent in a number of Latin American countries in the past three
years, according to a report released Tuesday in the Chilean
capital by Raquel Peña-Montenegro, regional director for Latin
America and the Caribbean of the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD). 
<P>
   The study reports that more than 90 million Latin American and
Caribbean peasant farmers currently live below the poverty line,
while 47 million live in extreme poverty. 
<P>
   The report was presented at the Catholic University of
Santiago, which hosted an international academic meeting on
''Globalisation and Local Development: Challenges for the Small
Farmer'', running Monday through Wednesday. 
<P>
   More than 300 experts from throughout the world are attending
the gathering, held in the framework of the 16th Symposium of the
International Farming Systems Association and the Fourth Latin
American Farming Systems Research and Extension Symposium. 
<P>
   The report presented by Peña-Montenegro was described as the
most complete study ever carried out on rural poverty in the
region. 
<P>
   The paper gave rise to a book, ''Towards a Region without Rural
Poor'', by Peña-Montenegro, Benjamín Quijandría and Aníbal
Monares. The book, which was also launched Tuesday, details IFAD's
strategy in fighting rural poverty in Latin America and the
Caribbean. 
<P>
   The rural population of Latin America and the Caribbean shrunk
steadily from 1980 to 1997, from a total of 122 million to 111
million, representing an average annual reduction of 0.87 percent. 
<P>
   Despite the positive macroeconomic trends reported in the
region in the first six years of the 1990s, the proportion of
rural poor and indigents remained constant during that period, and
began to swell towards the end of the decade. 
<P>
   Peña-Montenegro pointed out that conceptual and methodological
disparities in measuring poverty in the region have led to
enormous differences in the statistics compiled. 
<P>
   While the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC) reported a total of 204 million poor people in
the region in 1997, the World Bank estimated the total of people
living in extreme poverty at 78.2 million in 1998. 
<P>
   Peña-Montenegro pointed out that the World Bank was referring
to those living in absolute poverty, but she also warned that
methodological choices were coloured by ideological visions. 
<P>
   One important consequence of underrating the number of poor is
that the problem gets pushed down on the list of government policy
priorities, while the image projected of progress being made in
the region can lead to the loss of access to international
development aid, she added. 
<P>
   The Rome-based IFAD was founded in 1977 to help the rural poor
in developing countries help themselves. Since its creation, it
has financed 548 projects in 114 countries with a total of 6.8
billion dollars in loans and donations. However, the agency's
efforts fall short without other sources of cooperation, the
regional director underlined. 
<P>
   In the past decade, IFAD has invested more than 600 million
dollars in 50 projects in 23 countries of Latin America and the
Caribbean. Counting the matching funds from governments and other
donors, total financing amounted to one billion dollars. 
<P>
   According to ECLAC, 78.2 million people lived below the poverty
line in rural areas in the region in 1997, while 47 million lived
in extreme poverty. 
<P>
   Peña-Montenegro pointed out that the data collected since then
indicates that rural poverty has grown between 10 and 20 percent
in Central America, Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil, bringing the
regional total to more than 90 million. 
<P>
   Over 90 percent of the rural poor in Latin America and the
Caribbean are concentrated in areas totalling more than nine
million square kilometres in northeastern Brazil, northern Mexico,
northwestern Venezuela, the Pacific coastlines and central areas
of Honduras and Nicaragua, and the northern parts of Peru and
Chile. 
<P>
   The IFAD official noted that there was structural rural poverty
that affected all ethnic minorities, rural women and landless
peasant farmers in the region, as opposed to transitional poverty
that affected small farmers, share-croppers and tenant farmers. 
<P>
   The rural poor are hit hardest by international crises and
natural disasters. Hurricane Mitch, for example, which claimed
thousands of lives in Central America in 1998, considerably
increased the number of poor in that region, Peña-Montenegro
observed. 
<P>
   There are 26 million rural indigenous people in the region, who
suffer from high levels of poverty as a consequence of social and
cultural exclusion, which also marginalises them from access to
credit and other technical and financial resources. 
<P>
   Peña-Montenegro's report also underscores that women are the
sole heads of eight to 10 million households in the region, two to
three million women work as seasonal wage-labourers, while 30 to
40 million women in stable relationships are partially or totally
responsible for their household's farming activities and small
rural industries. 
<P>
   The study maintains that the adoption of neo-liberal policies
in Latin America and the Caribbean has brought about a 40 percent
reduction in investment in rural and farming areas, another factor
that has contributed to the rise in poverty. 
<P>
   Farming, forestry and stockbreeding systems introduced as a
consequence of the liberalisation of trade and access to external
markets have had a heavy impact on the environment, the report
adds. 
<P>
   The study urges that policies focusing on bandaid or
superficial welfare solutions have failed to make inroads against
rural poverty and should be replaced by agricultural development
policies based on productive investment. 
<P>
   It also recommends safeguarding small farmers from ''premature
exposure'' to international markets, in order to mitigate the
negative impacts of globalisation.
