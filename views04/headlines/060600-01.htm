New York -          The adage that money cannot buy happiness may be 
familiar, but is easily forgotten in a consumer society. A much more 
persistent and seductive message is beamed from every television screen: 
Contentment is available for the price of this car, that computer, a little 
more getting and spending.	 

<P>  Over the last few years, however, psychological researchers have been 
amassing an impressive body of data suggesting that satisfaction simply is 
not for sale. Not only does having more things prove to be unfulfilling, but 
also people for whom affluence is a priority in life tend to experience an 
unusual degree of anxiety and depression as well as a lower overall level of 
well-being. Likewise, those who would like nothing more than to be famous or 
attractive do not fare as well, psychologically speaking, as those who 
primarily want to develop close relationships, become more self-aware or 
contribute to the community.	 
</P>
<P>  Earlier research had demonstrated that neither income nor attractiveness 
is strongly correlated with a sense of well-being. But Dr. Richard Ryan, 
professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, and Dr. Tim Kasser, 
a former student who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Knox 
College in Illinois, have discovered that the news is even worse.	 
</P>
<P>  In three sets of studies published in leading psychology journals since 
1993, with a new article this year in Personality and Social Psychology 
Bulletin and still more papers on the way, the researchers sketch an 
increasingly bleak portrait of people who value ``extrinsic goals'' like 
money, fame and beauty.	 
</P>
<P>  Such people are not only more depressed than others, but also report more 
behavioral problems and physical discomfort, as well as scoring lower on 
measures of vitality and self-actualization. While not every study has 
investigated the full list of effects, the pattern that emerges from the 
research project as a whole is remarkably consistent.	 
</P>
<P>  Ryan and Kasser said their studies provided a look at the ``dark side of 
the American dream,'' noting that the culture in some ways seemed to be 
built on precisely what turned out to be detrimental to mental health. 
Americans are encouraged to try to strike it rich, but, ``the more we seek 
satisfactions in material goods, the less we find them there,'' Ryan said. 
``The satisfaction has a short half-life; it's very fleeting.''	 
</P>
<P>  Moreover, the detrimental effect of extrinsic goals seems to hold 
regardless of age or even level of income: A preoccupation with money bodes 
ill regardless of how much money one already has. The effects also appear 
not to be limited to any one culture. Kasser and his associates have now 
collected data from subjects in 13 countries, including Germany, Russia and 
India. The fact that pursuing wealth is psychologically unhelpful and often 
destructive, he reports, ``comes through very strongly in every culture I've 
looked at.''	 
</P>
<P>  Affluence, per se, does not necessarily result in an unsatisfying life. 
Problems are primarily associated with ``living a life where that's your 
focus,'' Ryan said. Nevertheless, the negative psychological picture does 
seem to be associated with the extent to which people believe that they are 
already on the way to attaining extrinsic goals.	 
</P>
<P>  For example, the paper to be published this year surveyed about 300 
youths, some in the United States and some in Russia. In both countries, 
lower levels of mental health were found not only in people who wanted to 
make a lot of money but also in those who thought they were likely to 
succeed at it.	 
</P>
<P>  Another study by the same researchers, not yet accepted for publication, 
found that college students who were already ``relatively high in the 
attainment of appearance, financial success and popularity'' were 
nevertheless ``lower in well-being and self-esteem.'' Those who aspired to 
affluence also had more transient relationships, watched more television and 
were more likely to use cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs than were those 
who placed less emphasis on extrinsic goals.	 
</P>
<P>  Apart from its obvious implications for a culture that thrives on 
material gain, this whole line of research raises questions about the 
proclivity of some psychologists to analyze the dynamics of what is often 
called goal-directed behavior while, in effect, ignoring the nature of the 
goal. Likewise, it challenges homespun advice to ``follow one's dream,'' 
whatever it may be.	 
</P>
<P>  These data strongly suggest that not all goals or dreams are created 
equal. According to the researchers, pursuing goals that reflect genuine 
human needs, like wanting to feel connected to others, turns out to be more 
psychologically beneficial than spending one's life trying to impress others 
or to accumulate trendy clothes, fancy gizmos and the money to keep buying 
them.	 
</P>
<P>  The latter quest may amount to using compensation to try to compensate 
for something more meaningful. The empirical support for this piece of the 
puzzle comes from a particularly provocative study that Kasser and Ryan 
conducted with Dr. Melvin Zax at the University of Rochester and Dr. Arnold 
Sameroff at the University of Michigan. These researchers discovered that 
18-year-
olds for whom financial success was especially important turned out to be 
disproportionately likely to have mothers who were not very nurturing. When 
parents are ``cold and controlling,'' the researchers wrote, ``their 
children apparently focus on attaining security and a sense of worth through 
external sources.''	 
</P>
<P>  This seems consistent with anecdotal accounts of very wealthy men who 
grew up in troubled homes. Such stories are sometimes cited as evidence that 
they made the best of a bad thing, turning out well despite or because of 
their unhappy childhoods. The problem with this interpretation, according to 
the research, is that they may not have turned out so well after all. They 
just turned out wealthy.
