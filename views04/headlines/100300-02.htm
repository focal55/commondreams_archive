<P>
<P>"We plan to test other processed corn products, though there has been no determination yet exactly which products," an FDA official said. "It's a logical follow-up to the whole incident. We didn't expect to find unapproved pesticide in the taco shells, but we did. So now we'll look to see if it is anywhere else."</P>

The Vermont Public Interest Research Group  demanded that the shells be removed from store shelves. On October 2, 2000 the FDA confirmed that the shells contained a banned biotech pesticide.

</font>In addition, the FDA plans to issue an official recall of the Taco Bell taco shells, marking the first recall of a bioengineered product by the agency. The recall was based on the FDA's determination that the shells posed a potential but limited threat to human health.
<P>
<P>The move will be a technicality since the taco shells were already recalled last month by their distributor, Kraft Foods, which found the corn in its own tests. But the recall underscores the seriousness of the incident for the biotechnology industry, which has been trying to reassure the public that its products are safe and well regulated.</P>
<P>
<P>The corn, known as Starlink, is produced by Aventis CropScience of Research Triangle Park, N.C. The corn won federal approval as an animal feed in 1988, but was not approved for human use because of concerns it may cause allergic reactions in people. The corn is engineered to contain a form of pesticide that combats the destructive European corn borer.</P>
<P>
<P>Discovery of the unapproved biotech corn was initially made in tests for the Genetically Engineered Alert, a coalition of environmental groups opposed to genetically engineered crops.</P>
<P>
<P>The resulting recall raised questions about the federal government's ability to regulate the fast-growing biotechnology industry. A high-level government and industry team was dispatched to Japan last week, for instance, to calm concerns sparked by the incident about engineered crops in general.</P>
<P>
<P>In addition to the still-unknown cost of Kraft's recall, Aventis agreed last week to spend at least $68 million buying back all StarLink corn currently being grown. That buyback will be administered by the federal government, which will oversee collection of StarLink corn now growing on about 315,000 acres. Officials said yesterday, however, that between 10 percent and 20 percent of the corn has probably already been harvested and is in the food chain.</P>
<P>
<P>Aventis said last week it will suspend StarLink sales until the Environmental Protection Agency acts on its application to approve the corn for human consumption. An EPA official said yesterday the agency is still considering what action to take against the company now that the FDA confirmed the contamination. Investigators are trying to determine how the corn got into the human food chain.</P>
<P>
<P>Larry Bohlen of Friends of the Earth, one of the environmental groups that sponsored the initial tests, said that the FDA now knows which farmers have been growing the StarLink corn, but refuses to release the information. "We think the public, and especially farmers, need to know where the corn is growing," he said.</P>
