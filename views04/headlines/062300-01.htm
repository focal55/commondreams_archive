WASHINGTON - Months 
after they dismissed Ralph Nader as 
a fringe third-party candidate who 
would fade quickly, Democratic and 
Republican strategists now say 
he has emerged as more politically 
potent than Patrick J. Buchanan and 
could deeply complicate the candidacy of Vice President Al Gore.

									</table></font></font></font>Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate 
who is expected to capture the Green 
Party's nomination in Denver this 
weekend, is in single digits in most 
polls. No one thinks he has a chance 
of rising to the electoral heights of 
Ross Perot in 1992, who at this point 
in that campaign had the support of 
about a third of the voters in many 
polls.   
<p>And few people predict that he 
will reach the 15 percent threshold 
required to assure a spot in the nationally televised candidate debates 
this fall.

<p> Even so, Mr. Nader is already 
forcing Mr. Gore to compete more 
vigorously for the active support of 
labor and other groups that are reliably Democratic. And many pollsters and analysts said that in a tight 
race with Gov. George W. Bush, a 
few points could make a difference 
-- and force Mr. Gore to reconsider 
his electoral calculations in important states.

<p>  In a close race, Mr. Nader could tip 
the balance in Michigan, Ohio and  
other swing states of the Midwest. In 
California, where Mr. Gore is running comfortably ahead, a Field Poll 
this week showed Mr. Nader drawing 
7 percent. And a  Quinnipiac University poll in Connecticut this week 
showed he had 9 percent. Mr. Nader 
is also showing strength in New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.

<p> More troubling for some Democrats is that Mr. Nader, who has 
ridiculed Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush as 
sounding identical and has emphasized his record as a consumer and 
environmental advocate, is becoming more and more popular with 
organized labor. By campaigning aggressively against the China trade 
deal, which passed in the House last 
month, Mr. Nader has effectively 
capitalized on labor's distress with 
Mr. Gore for his support of the measure.

<p> In doing so, Mr. Nader has made 
Mr. Gore battle for a constituency 
that his campaign thought it could 
count on. In fact, pollsters say most 
of Mr. Nader's backers are not the 
swing voters that Mr. Gore needs to 
win over, but staunch Democrats 
who should already be on his side.

<p> "The Bush people, I'm sure, are 
thrilled about Nader," said one of 
Mr. Gore's most senior aides.

<p> Mr. Nader's potential for trouble 
was on display here today, when 
James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, appeared beside him at a news 
conference and ridiculed the vice 
president.

<p> "There is no distinction between 
Al Gore and George W. Bush when it 
comes to trade," Mr. Hoffa asserted 
after Mr. Nader met privately with 
the Teamsters' 24-member executive board. He added that Mr. Gore 
was "wrong on trade" and said, "We 
agree wholeheartedly with what Mr. 
Nader has said." Mr. Nader won a 
standing ovation from the board.

<p> Imploring the audience to take 
him seriously, Mr. Nader said: "People are always asking, 'Am I worried 
about taking votes away from Gore?' 
No. I'm worried about Gore taking 
votes away from me."

<p> Gore advisers said they had 
moved aggressively behind the 
scenes to try to keep Mr. Hoffa from 
endorsing Mr. Nader, to the point 
where they had directed projects 
through federal agencies that would 
use Teamsters.

<p> Those efforts may be paying off -- 
at least for now. "We're not going to 
hurry to endorse," Mr. Hoffa said 
today. But even Gore aides said a 
Teamsters endorsement of the vice 
president seemed increasingly less 
likely.

<p> "We have options of endorsing or 
not endorsing," Mr. Hoffa added.

<p>    Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the 
assistant Democratic leader who is a 
Gore loyalist, contacted several labor leaders today, discouraging 
them from defecting to Mr. Nader. In 
an interview, he bluntly condemned 
Mr. Nader as a spoiler.

<p> "Ralph Nader is a very selfish 
person and he's on an ego trip," Mr. 
Reid said. "He has no respect for the 
process."

<p>    Mr. Gore had never anticipated 
new headaches with labor, given that 
he had to struggle last fall to win the 
A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement against 
former Senator Bill Bradley. Now, 
not only have the Teamsters not rallied behind Mr. Gore, but he is also 
struggling for backing from the United Automobile Workers. The Teamsters have 1.4 million members; the 
U.A.W. has 800,000.

<p> Earlier this year, most political 
strategists viewed Mr. Buchanan as 
the biggest threat -- and a potentially big problem for Mr. Bush. He has 
run twice for the Republican presidential nomination, even winning the 
critical New Hampshire primary in 
1996. And if he wins the backing of 
the Reform Party, whose nomination 
he is seeking, he would draw $12.6 
million in federal money.

<p> But even if Mr. Buchanan gets that 
money, strategists now say Mr. Nader has a greater potential impact on 
the race because polls show that he 
takes his support almost exclusively 
from Mr. Gore. Mr. Buchanan, with 
backing both from protectionist 
Democrats and conservative Republicans, does not have as much potential to wound Mr. Bush.

<p>      Even with the Reform Party nomination, Mr. Buchanan  would be 
weakened because many in that party do not like him. And despite Mr. 
Buchanan's staunch position against 
free trade, many unions see Mr. Nader as more of a soulmate because, 
unlike Mr. Buchanan, he is not conservative on social issues.

<p>   Over all, Mr. Nader is a far more 
popular figure than the controversial 
Mr. Buchanan. Fifty percent of registered voters have a negative view of 
Mr. Buchanan, while only 15 percent 
have a negative view of Mr. Nader, 
according to an NBC News/Wall 
Street Journal poll taken June 14-18. 
The poll found that 12 percent had a 
positive view of Mr. Buchanan, while 
33 percent had a positive view of Mr. 
Nader.

<p> "I would hate to be Al Gore looking 
at the third-party horizon this  year," 
said J. David Gillespie, a political 
scientist at Presbyterian College in 
Clinton, S.C., who is an authority on 
third-party candidacies. "Nader's 
draw in key states may be very 
crucial in determining the outcome 
of this election."

<p> The strategy of the Gore and Bush 
campaigns thus far has been to ignore Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan, 
and not do anything to raise their 
profiles. 

<p>    Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee, echoing some Gore advisers, insisted that he was not at all 
unsettled by Mr. Nader. "I'm not 
worried about it," he said. "It doesn't 
make much difference if Ralph Nader is an angel or not: people aren't 
going to throw their votes away." 

<p> Most voters, he said, do not know 
much about Mr. Nader -- and his 
backers will sour on him when they 
realize he is just "a human being" 
and not a loftier figure. "He's 
reached his high point right now," 
Mr. Andrew said.

<p> A strategist for Mr. Gore put it this 
way: "In June, you're wasting your 
energy if you worry about these 
things. In October, it would be worrisome."
