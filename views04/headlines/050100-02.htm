Rioblanco de Sotara, Colombia  --        The children and their 
teachers were in the schoolyard, they say, playing soccer and basketball and 
waiting for classes to begin when the crop-duster appeared. At first they 
waved, but as the plane drew closer and a gray mist began to stream from its 
wings, alarmed teachers rushed the pupils to their classrooms.
<P>  Over the next two weeks, a fleet of counternarcotics planes taking part 
in a U.S.-sponsored program to eradicate heroin poppy cultivation returned 
here repeatedly. Time and time again, residents charge, the government 
planes also sprayed buildings and fields that were not supposed to be 
targets, damaging residents' health and crops.	 
</P>
<P>  ``The pilot was flying low, so there is no way he could not have seen 
those children,'' said Nidia Majin, principal of the La Floresta rural 
elementary school, whose 70 pupils were sprayed that Monday morning last 
June. ``We had no way to give them first aid, so I sent them home. But they 
had to cross fields and streams that had also been contaminated, so some of 
them got sick.''	 
</P>
<P>  In fact, say leaders of this Yanacona Indian village high in the Andes, 
dozens of other residents also became ill during the spraying campaign, 
complaining of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, rashes, blurred vision and ear 
and stomachaches. They say the spraying damaged legitimate crops, 
undermining government efforts to support residents who have abandoned poppy 
growing.	 
</P>
<P>  Such incidents are not limited to this village of 5,000, say critics, but 
have occurred in many parts of Colombia and are bound to increase if the 
fumigation program is intensified, as the Clinton administration is 
proposing as part of a $1.6 billion emergency aid package.	 
</P>
<P>  Critics say they frequently receive reports of mistakes and abuses by the 
planes' Colombian pilots that both the U.S. and Colombian governments choose 
to ignore. State Department officials deny indiscriminate spraying takes 
place, with a U.S. Embassy official in Bogota describing the residents' 
claims of illnesses as ``scientifically impossible.''	 
</P>
<P>  But to local leaders, the situation brought on by the spraying remains a 
crisis. ``The fumigation was done in an indiscriminate and irresponsible 
manner, and it did not achieve its objective,'' said Ivan Alberto 
Chicangana, who was the mayor when the spraying occurred.	 
</P>
<P>  ``The damage done to the physical and economic well-being of this 
community has been serious,'' he said, ``and is going to be very difficult 
for us to overcome.''	 
</P>
<P>  He and other local leaders say that people were sick for several weeks 
after the spraying, and in interviews a few residents complained of lasting 
symptoms. Three fish farms with more than 25,000 rainbow trout were 
destroyed, residents said, and numerous farm animals, mostly chickens and 
guinea pigs, died, while others, including some cows and horses, fell ill.	 
</P>
<P>  In addition, fields of beans, onions, garlic, potatoes, corn and other 
traditional crops were sprayed, leaving plants to wither and die. As a 
result, community leaders here say, crop-substitution projects sponsored by 
the Colombian government have been irremediably damaged and their 
participants left impoverished.	 
</P>
<P>  Peasants in the coca-growing region of Caqueta, to the southeast, last 
year complained to a reporter that spray planes had devastated the crops 
they had planted after abandoning coca, and similar reports have emerged 
from Guaviare, another province to the east.	 
</P>
<P>  U.S.-financed aerial spraying campaigns have been the principal means by 
which the Colombian government has sought to reduce coca and opium-poppy 
cultivation for nearly a decade. The government fleet has grown to include 
65 airplanes and helicopters, which fly every day, weather permitting, from 
three bases. Last year, the spraying effort resulted in the fumigation of 
104,000 acres of coca and 20,000 acres of opium poppy.	 
</P>
<P>  Yet despite such efforts, which have been backed by more than $150 
million in U.S. aid, cocaine and heroin production in Colombia has more than 
doubled since 1995.	 
</P>
<P>  In an effort to reverse that trend and weaken left-wing guerrilla and 
right-wing paramilitary groups that are profiting from the drug trade and 
threatening the country's stability, the Clinton administration is now 
urging Congress to approve a new aid package, which calls for increased 
spending on drug eradication as well as a gigantic increase for 
crop-substitution programs, to $127 million from $5 million.	 
</P>
<P>  Critics, like Elsa Nivia, director of the Colombian affiliate of the 
advocacy organization Pesticide Action Network, see the eradication effort 
as dangerous and misguided. ``These pilots don't care if they are fumigating 
over schools, houses, grazing areas or sources of water,'' she said in an 
interview at the group's headquarters in Cali. ``Furthermore, spraying only 
exacerbates the drug problem by destabilizing communities that are trying to 
get out of illicit crops and grow legal alternatives.''	 
The U.S. Embassy official who supervises the spraying program said in an 
interview in Bogota that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the pesticide 
used here, is ``less toxic than table salt or aspirin.'' Calling it ``the 
most studied herbicide in the world,'' he said it was proven to be harmless 
to human and animal life and called the villagers' account ``scientifically 
impossible.''	 
</P>
<P>  But in an out-of-court settlement in New York state in 1996, Monsanto, a 
leading manufacturer of glyphosate-based herbicides, though not necessarily 
identical to those used here, including one called Roundup, agreed to 
withdraw claims that the product is ``safe, nontoxic, harmless or free from 
risk.'' The company signed a statement agreeing that its ``absolute claims 
that Roundup `will not wash or leach in the soil' is not accurate'' because 
glyphosate ``may move through some types of soil under some conditions after 
application.''	 
</P>
<P>  In the United States, the EPA has approved glyphosate for most commercial 
uses.
