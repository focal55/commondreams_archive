CONDEMNATION POURED out from around the
        Middle East Saturday over what Saudi Arabia called
        Israel's &#147;brutal aggression&#148; during clashes
        this week in which 22 Palestinians were killed and nearly
        750 injured. <p>Many focused their condemnation on
        Israeli right-wing leader Ariel Sharon, whose visit
        Thursday to the compound of holy mosques in Jerusalem
        sparked the days of riots. </p>
        <p>The area, known as Haram Al Sharif, is the third most
        sacred site in Islam. Israelis call the site Temple
        Mount. </p>

</TABLE>
</font>A Saudi government spokesman said Sharon's visit was
        &#147;an affront to the feelings of the Palestinian
        people and the Islamic nation and a violation of the
        sacred nature of the Islamic places&#148; in Jerusalem. 
        <p>In Amman, Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib denounced
        the &#147;escalation (of violence) and the provocative
        acts at the sacred Islamic sites of Jerusalem that have
        infuriated the Palestinians and brought about the
        confrontations of the past two days.&#148; </p>
        <p>In a statement carried by the Jordan News Agency,
        Petra, he called on the Israeli government to &#147;take
        the necessary steps to avoid the resumption of the
        provocative acts that complicate the situation even
        more&#148; during the decisive juncture through which the
        peace process is passing<b>.</b> </p>
        <p>The Iranian government, which does not recognise
        Israel and is opposed to the peace process, also reacted
        harshly. </p>
        <p>A foreign ministry spokesman called the latest
        incidents Israel's &#147;new crime,&#148; and lambasted
        what he said was &#147;an attack on the faithful, praying
        and defenceless, martyring several of them, with the sole
        objective of Judaising Al Qods (the Arabic name for
        Jerusalem).&#148; </p>
        <p>Hamid-Reza Assefi went on to say that the
        &#147;permanent crimes of this regime are in complete
        contradiction with the claims of (its) leaders, who
        pretend they want peace.&#148; </p>
        <p>The Arab League meanwhile tried to mobilise support
        for the Palestinians. </p>
        <p>League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguib met with
        Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Cairo and said they
        discused the &#147;situation in the region, particularly
        the bloody incidents at Haram Al Sharif after the visit
        by Ariel Sharon, which profaned the Muslim holy
        sites.&#148; </p>
        <p>Abdel Meguid added that Arab ambassadors had been
        summoned to discuss the crisis at League headquarters
        here on Sunday under the chairmanship of Palestinian
        information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo. </p>

</TABLE>
</font>Later Saturday, Meguid said the League would consider
        calling a special summit to discuss the bloodshed in east
        Jerusalem. 
        <p>Asked on the Qatari-based satellite television channel
        Al Jazeera about a possible summit, Abdel Meguid said:
        &#147;That is effectively what we are hoping. This
        question will no doubt be discussed during the special
        meeting of the Arab League.&#148; </p>
        <p>&#147;We are going to carry out all the necessary
        contacts with the head of the UN Security Council and the
        secretary general of the United Nations. That is what we
        decided during the tripartite meeting held today,&#148;
        Abdel Meguid told the television channel. </p>
        <p>&#147;It is the visit of the criminal Sharon which is
        at the origin of the butchery&#148; in the Palestinian
        territories, which has cost 22 lives in the past two
        days, he said. </p>
        <p>&#147;Sharon, with his dark past, is the criminal of
        Sabra and Shatila. Today, he sullies the sanctuaries of
        Islam,&#148; Abdel Meguid said. </p>
        <p>Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail reacted
        similarly, calling Sharon's visit &#147;provocative&#148;
        and voicing his country's support for the Palestinian
        cause. </p>
        <p>Earlier, the Syrian official newspaper Tishrin called
        Friday's events a &#147;massacre,&#148; claiming that
        Israeli leaders &#147;systematically use massacres and
        assassinations to carry out their expanionist plans. </p>
        <p>&#147;It appears as if the failure of Israeli
        negotiators to persuade the Palestinians to abandon
        Jerusalem has caused Israel's leaders to lose their
        heads,&#148; the newspaper continued. </p>
        <p>Beirut newspapers took a similar line, considering the
        &#147;massacre&#148; a declaration of war against the
        peace process, and condemning Sharon, who led Israel's
        1982 full-scale invasion of Lebanon. </p>
        <p>The front-page editorial of the leading An-Nahar
        newspaper said Sharon's visit &#147;was not just to send
        messages...it was like the bullet that he fired as a
        declaration of war against the peace process and against
        all those promoting it in Israel and abroad.&#148; </p>

</font>Thousands of Palestinian refugees demonstrated in
        south Lebanon on Saturday against the killing of
        Palestinians in three days of clashes with Israeli troops
        and police. 
        <p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Selim Al Hoss urged the
        international community to &#147;act immediately and stop
        the continuous Israeli aggressions.&#148; </p>
        <p>In Lebanon's biggest Palestinian refugee camp, Ain El
        Hilweh, protesters marched in the streets, chanting
        anti-Israeli slogans and burning an effigy of rightwing
        Israeli politician Ariel Sharon. </p>
        <p>&#147;Sharon, we will never forget your massacres in
        Sabra and Shatila. The Aqsa Mosque is Arab and would
        remain Arab,&#148; read one banner. </p>
        <p>Thousands of Palestinians also demonstrated in Bourj
        Al Shimali camp near the port city of Tyre, burning US
        and Israeli flags. </p>
        <p>&#147;We are ready to sacrifice our souls and blood
        for Jerusalem,&#148; chanted the protesters in Bourj Al
        Shimali, carrying pictures of Palestinian President
        Yasser Arafat. </p>
        <p>Fathi Abu Al Audat, a representative of the main
        Palestinian Fatah group at Ain El Hilweh near the
        southern Lebanese city of Sidon, urged Arab countries to
        support the Palestinians. </p>
        <p>&#147;We urge our brothers to stand by the Palestinian
        people in their battle and help them set up their
        independent state,&#148; he said in a speech. </p>
        
<p><b>Thousands of Alexandria students protest </b></p>
        <p>In Alexandria, around 5,000 Egyptian university
        students on Saturday protested the Israeli massacre of
        Palestinians, an AFP correspondent reported. </p>
        <p>The protesters, responding to calls from the banned
        but partly tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, marched at three
        university locations in the Mediterranean city of
        Alexandria. </p>
        <p>The police did not intervene. </p>
        <p>Students called on Arab countries to act rapidly after
        denouncing what it called the Israeli army's
        &#147;massacre at Al Aqsa.&#148; </p>
        <p>Demonstrations are forbidden in Egypt, but are
        tolerated inside university grounds and are kept under
        police surveillance. </p>
        <p>In Tehran, a leader of the Palestinian Islamic
        resistance group Hamas on Saturday called for all Muslims
        to rise up in defence of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>Khaled Mishaal, head of the Hamas political bureau,
        said &#147;the situation is very grave. It means all the
        children of Islam must unite to save Al Qods and Al Aqsa
        (the Jerusalem mosque which is Islam's third holiest
        site).&#148; </p>
        <p>&#147;All the Muslims of the world should rise up to
        strengthen their control over the sacred sites of Al
        Qods,&#148; Mishaal told journalists on arriving in
        Tehran for a visit. </p>
        <p>&#147;The situation in Palestine is extremely
        grave,&#148; he added, referring to clashes with Israeli
        security forces this week that have left eight
        Palestinians dead and hundreds injured. </p>
        
<p><b>US State Department criticises Sharon </b></p>
        <p>On Friday, the US State Department on criticised
        Sharon for visiting Al Haram Al Sharif and said the
        Palestinians also should avoid actions that create
        tension. </p>
        <p>The State Department, which on Thursday called in
        general terms for a lowering of tensions, on Friday got
        specific and pointed an accusing finger at Sharon, a
        former general and Cabinet minister. </p>
        <p>&#147;We were quite concerned that the visit by Sharon
        to this site risked creating tensions,&#148; spokesman
        Richard Boucher said. &#147;And, in fact, it did.&#148; </p>
        <p>&#147;We think it's incumbent upon people on both
        sides to avoid actions that inflame the situation and
        create tension,&#148; he said. </p>
        <p>As for Palestinian demonstrations, Boucher said
        &#147;certainly we don't approve of any violence. We
        don't condone it.&#148; </p>
        <p>In fact, he said, &#147;the two sides should be
        actively working to stop the violence. But also, in the
        meantime, we need to remember how important it is to
        actively work to reach an agreement.&#148;
