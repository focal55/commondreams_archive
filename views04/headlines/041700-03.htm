WASHINGTON - Police
detained
hundreds
of
anti-globalization
demonstrators
Monday
and
hurled
tear
gas
and
sprayed
pepper
to
crush
protests
aimed
at
disrupting
the
final
day
of
talks
between
world
financial
leaders.
<p>About
5,000
protesters
massed
behind
police
barricades
a
block
away
from
the
International
Monetary
Fund
(IMF)
and
World
Bank
buildings,
where
world
financial
leaders
started
talks
two
hours
ahead
of
schedule
to
avoid
the
demonstrators.

<p>There
were
repeated
scuffles
between
protesters
and
police
clad
in
riot
gear
and
gas
masks.
Even
the
city's
police
chief,
Charles
Ramsey,
helped
wrestle
a
demonstrator
to
the
ground.
<p>

``There
have
been
a
couple
of
skirmishes,
officers
being
assaulted
during
these
arrests,
but
it's
nothing
we
can't
handle,''
Ramsey
told
reporters.
<p>Chanting
slogans
such
as
``More
World,
less
Bank,''
the
protesters
claim
the
global
lenders'
policies
hurt
the
economies
of
the
poor
countries
they
are
meant
to
help.
<p>Protesters
lined
up
in
driving
rain
behind
police
barricades
just
one
block
from
the
bank
and
IMF
buildings
and
several
blocks
away
from
the
White
House.
President
Clinton
was
out
of
town.
<p>After
a
tense
stand-off
for
about
an
hour,
police
allowed
small
groups
to
cross
the
barrier
and
then
face
arrest.
Police
could
not
provide
an
exact
figure
but
reporters
on
the
scene
estimated
that
hundreds
were
held.
<p>Washington's
Deputy
Police
Chief
Terrance
Gainer,
who
helped
to
negotiate
the
``peaceful
arrests,''
accepted
a
bunch
of
roses
from
protesters
at
the
barricades.
<p>Protesters
told
Reuters
the
group's
``tactical
committee''
had
originally
voted
to
storm
the
barricades
and
break
into
the
building
where
world
financial
leaders
were
meeting,
but
then
decided
to
opt
for
peaceful
arrests
as
a
sign
of
protest.
<p>Movie
stars
Susan
Sarandon
and
Tim
Robbins
joined
the
demonstrators,
who
caused
traffic
chaos
in
the
city
and
led
the
federal
government
to
order
only
emergency
workers
to
report
for
work
in
a
large
area
surrounding
the
IMF
and
World
Bank.
<p>Robbins
said
he
was
very
impressed
by
the
demonstrations.
''I
think
this
is
exciting
because
it
is
such
a
wide
coalition
of
people.
You
haven't
seen
this
kind
of
unity
before.''
<p>Police
sprayed
pepper
frequently
during
the
day
and
Washington
Mayor
Anthony
Williams
said
tear
gas
was
used
once.
<p>He
denied
accusations
from
protesters
that
the
police
used
heavy-handed
tactics.
``The
police
have
shown
great
poise
and
discipline
throughout
this
episode,''
Williams
told
CNN.
<p>Steve
Kretzmann,
a
spokesman
for
the
Mobilization
for
Global
Justice,
said
the
protests
had
been
a
victory
for
the
organizers
but
that
the
police
had
gone
too
far.
<p>``They
(police)
have
militarized
our
capital.
This
kind
of
force
only
strengthens
our
resolve.
We
will
not
back
down,''
Kretzmann
told
a
news
conference.
<p>Ramsey
said
the
tear
gas
incident
had
been
a
mistake
and
the
police
officer
involved
thought
he
was
throwing
a
smoke
grenade.
<p>He
said
World
Bank
delegates
had
been
surrounded
by
about
200
protesters
who
were
dressed
in
black
and
wearing
masks.
''The
officer
got
out,
thought
he
was
throwing
a
smoke
grenade
to
break
up
the
crowd
and
it
actually
was
tear
gas.''
<p>The
World
Bank's
Development
Committee
--
discussing
debt
relief,
trade
and
the
fight
against
AIDS
--
started
its
meetings
with
a
breakfast
at
6:30
a.m.
(1030
GMT),
moving
on
at
7:30
a.m.
(1130
GMT)
to
the
formal
session.
<p>Early
in
the
day,
police
detained
more
than
35
black-clad
protesters
for
``incommoding,''
which
means
blocking
the
sidewalk.
Police
forced
them
onto
their
knees
and
locked
plastic
handcuffs
onto
them.
<p>Closer
to
the
World
Bank's
glitzy
headquarters,
police
detained
another
18-20
people
and
piled
them
onto
a
school
bus
after
again
putting
handcuffs
on
them.
<p>Ramsey
said
a
search
of
bags
carried
by
those
detained
had
disgorged
nails,
gas
masks,
rocks,
sling
shots
and
what
he
called
``home
made
concoctions,''
including
bottles
of
urine.
<p>One
was
marked
``Seattle
special,''
in
reference
to
last
year's
riots
in
the
port
city
that
sank
global
trade
talks.
<p>Ramsey
said
Monday's
protests
were
less
significant
than
those
at
the
weekend
but
he
did
not
have
complete
figures
yet.
<p>Protest
organizers
claimed
they
had
20,000
demonstrators
on
the
streets
of
the
capital
Sunday.
Police
estimated
10,000
protesters
attended
one
demonstration
on
the
grassy
Ellipse
near
the
White
House,
a
good-humored
rally
that
drew
supporters
from
causes
ranging
from
AIDS
to
Third
World
rights.
<p>As
in
the
anti-trade
protests
in
Seattle
last
December,
the
demonstrators
in
Washington
underwent
weeks
of
training
and
appeared
to
be
highly
organized.
But
unlike
Seattle,
District
police
quickly
responded
to
attempts
by
protesters
to
disrupt
the
meetings
here,
keeping
the
crowds
mostly
under
control.
<p>Sharon
Alexander,
a
49-year-old
from
Boulder,
Co.,
said
she
had
taken
part
in
the
Seattle
protests.
``Seattle
was
a
lot
more
fun,''
she
said,
adding
that
Washington
police
seemed
to be more organized.
