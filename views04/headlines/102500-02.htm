<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 — Concerned that Ralph Nader has become a major threat to Vice President Al Gore's ability to win the presidency, the Democratic Party and its allies in the labor, environmental and women's movements are mounting aggressive campaigns in swing states across the country to dissuade liberal voters from supporting Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate. 
<P> In the Pacific Northwest, the League of Conservation Voters is preparing to run radio advertisements asserting that voting for Mr. Nader would be tantamount to voting for Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican. In Ohio, the state Democratic Party has begun flooding college campuses with leaflets urging students not to waste their ballots on the Green Party. In Wisconsin, the Service Employees International Union has dispatched hundreds of organizers to implore its 12,000 state members to vote Democratic, not Green.</P>

</font>And the Democratic National Committee has organized an array of prominent liberals, including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gloria Steinem and Robert Redford to stump for Mr. Gore in Nader strongholds like Eugene, Ore., Madison, Wis., and Seattle.
<P> Not wanting to offend Mr. Nader or his supporters, those surrogates have been paying homage to his long record of fighting for a cleaner environment, consumer protection and labor rights. But they warn that a strong Nader showing can only help Mr. Bush — with potentially dire consequences for the very causes liberals hold most dear.</P>
<P> "Mr. Nader is a good man, he's raised important issues," said Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager. "But he himself admits that he can't win. What could be lost in this election is a woman's right to choose, what could be lost are tough environmental protections."</P>
<P> Told of the effort to squeeze the air out of his campaign, Mr. Nader said in an interview tonight: "Their policy for six months has been to ignore me. So obviously we welcome this enhanced attention."</P>
<P> He added, "All these good people who have succumbed to the lesser-of- two-evils syndrome are setting themselves up for another cycle of political betrayal."</P>
<P> Indeed, the sudden mobilization against Mr. Nader comes after Gore campaign officials had for months dismissed him as inconsequential. But Mr. Nader has stubbornly continued to hover around 5 percent in polls taken in half a dozen tightly contested states where a shift of just a percentage point or two could determine the winner, including Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and New Mexico. A poll released today even shows Mr. Nader cutting into Mr. Gore's once- substantial lead in California.</P>
<P> Now, with just two weeks left in one of the closest presidential campaigns in decades, Democrats say the last thing Mr. Gore needs is to be forced into a two-front war against both Mr. Bush and Mr. Nader. And while Gore campaign officials continue to express confidence in public that Mr. Nader's support will dwindle by Election Day, they are telling their surrogates in private that they are worried the Green Party candidate has become a real danger. </P>
<P> "Bill Daley is well aware that it's extremely important to deal with Nader voters," Mr. Wellstone said, referring to Mr. Gore's campaign chairman. "He understands this could be the margin of defeat or victory in the battleground states."</P>
<P> Mr. Gore himself has begun addressing Mr. Nader's challenge head on, telling voters in Washington on Monday that his environmental record was as strong as Mr. Nader's.</P>
<P> "I don't want to use the argument that a vote for him is a vote for Bush — that may be true," Mr. Gore told a reporter for KIRO-TV in Seattle. "I prefer to say, `Look, I want you to look at my record and my agenda and my passion for doing the right thing.' And I'll match that against anybody."</P>
<P> But Democratic strategists say they want Mr. Gore to avoid mentioning Mr. Nader, arguing that doing so only elevates the insurgent's profile and draws attention from their real target, Mr. Bush. For that reason, the Democrats are trying to shift the burden of wooing Nader voters to a stable of well-known liberal politicians and advocates.</P>
<P> Ms. Steinem, for example, has been traveling by bus to campuses along the Pacific Coast, reading her list of "the top 10 reasons I'm not voting for Nader." On Sunday, she plans to join Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, Robert Cox, president of the Sierra Club, and the rock singer Melissa Etheridge for a concert and rally in Seattle.</P>
<P> Their roadshow is scheduled to visit Oregon, Wisconsin and New Mexico next week. "Whatever value Nader brings to the public discourse," Ms. Birch said in an interview today, "it pales compared to handing the federal government and Supreme Court over to George Bush. We will do everything we can to peel votes away from Nader and give them back to Gore." </P>
<P> Mr. Nader has tried to argue that he is not likely to hurt Mr. Gore, asserting that many of his supporters are non-Democrats who probably would not vote if he dropped out of the race. Democrats dispute that. He has also said in recent weeks that he would focus his final campaigning on states where either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore holds a substantial lead. But his tentative schedule includes stops in closely contested states like Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. </P>
<P> The Democrats have asked Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, to campaign for Mr. Gore in the Pacific Northwest. And the Sierra Club will begin running television spots next week in five states where Mr. Nader is polling well that carry the message: "Think there's no difference between the candidates? Think again."</P>
<P> Former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Mr. Gore's rival in the Democratic primaries, is being dispatched later this week to campaign in Oregon and Washington, where Democratic strategists are counting on him to woo liberal white men for Mr. Gore. Mr. Jackson has been sent to colleges where Mr. Nader is considered popular, including the University of Wisconsin at Madison. </P>
<P> Because Mr. Nader could also win votes from union members who are angry with Mr. Gore for supporting global trade, the Democrats have organized a list of heavyweight labor leaders to help. Earlier this week, John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., toured the Northwest with other labor officials urging labor activists to stick with Mr. Gore.</P>
<P> Andrew L. Stern, head of the service employees union, said in an interview that he had been telling crowds in the Northwest: "If you can wake up the next morning and live with George Bush as the next president, then I guess you can vote for Nader. This is not a low-risk protest vote."</P>
<P> The Democratic Party has also been asking Gore supporters to flood the Nader campaign with e-mail messages urging him to drop out of the race. It has also been promoting a Web site created by a group of former colleagues of Mr. Nader's called <a href="http://www.nadersraidersforgore.com">nadersraidersforgore.com</a>. </P>
<P> Yet for all those efforts, some Democrats say they think the Gore campaign was slow to respond.</P>
<P> Gary Sellers of Nader's Raiders for Gore, said of Mr. Gore's campaign: "I think they are not taking him as seriously as they should. The Nader people are true believers. It's going to take some time to convince them to vote against him."</P>
