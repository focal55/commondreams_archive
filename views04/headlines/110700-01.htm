BOGOTA, Nov 6   - The candidate who wins the United States
presidential elections Tuesday will maintain that country's
support for 'Plan Colombia' in the US war on the drug trade, which
is based on repression in drug-producing nations, agree Colombian
politicians and experts. 
<P>
   The similar stances held by Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore regarding Plan Colombia, President Andrés
Pastrana's anti-drug and pro-development initiative, indicate that
the US drug-fighting policy will continue its course. 
<P>
   Aid totalling 1.3 billion dollars, approved by the US Congress
with bipartisan support, was finalised in August during President
Bill Clinton's visit to Cartagena, on Colombia's northern coast. 
<P>
   The two presidential candidates, with slight differences, back
the drug policy line the United States has been following for more
than a decade - based on fighting drug trafficking at the source,
in the producing countries, said Luis Valencia, a National
University expert in international relations. 
<P>
   As a result, ''relations with Colombia will continue to be
'drug-based' as long as we remain the leading provider of
narcotics for the US market,'' even though under the Pastrana
administration ''we went from being a pariah country to an ally in
the fight against the drug trade,'' he told IPS. 
<P>
   Valencia believes Gore would continue with the hemispheric
priorities set by Clinton, who considers drug trafficking and
circumstances in Colombian to be a matter of US national security. 
<P>
   Vicente Torrijos, former director of the governmental School
for Advanced Studies, says continued US support for Plan Colombia
is a sure thing, at least for the next two years, but agreed with
Valencia that the bilateral relations ''will continue to be based
on drugs as long as it continues to be the Colombian reality.'' 
<P>
   But the expert forecast sharp differences between the two
candidates as far as their potential reaction to the United
States' first assessment of Plan Colombia, to take place in two
years. 
<P>
   For Gore, the human rights question would weigh upon the
evaluation, while for Bush the essential component would be the
concrete results of the anti-drug programmes, said Torrijos. 
<P>
   The most likely scenario in two years, according to Torrijos,
is that illicit crops, which today cover 120,000 hectares, will
not have diminished despite Plan Colombia, and the peace processes
underway between the government and guerrilla groups will not
achieve major advances. 
<P>
   In assessing such a situation, Gore ''would tend to maintain
the line initiated by Clinton for co-operation,'' while Bush, ''if
the results are unsatisfactory, could turn to a more heavy-handed
approach.'' 
<P>
   During the electoral campaign, Gore has claimed as his own
achievement that under the Clinton administration the US Congress
has approved the largest anti-drug budget, which grew from 12.2
billion to 18.5 billion dollars, including 1.3 billion for
Colombia. 
<P>
   Bush has indicated that the US aid package, largely earmarked
for military expenditures, is essential for the Colombian
government ''to protect is people, fight drug trafficking'' and
halt the insurgent groups, ''which are financed by drug profits.'' 
<P>
   The US policy of a full-out war on drugs, with its current
focus on producing countries, gathered strength in 1989 under the
Republican administration of George Bush, father of that party's
current presidential candidate. 
<P>
   Following the end of the Cold War, the United States needed a
new enemy to replace communism as the threat to its national
security, and that role went to the drug trade, with the Colombian
cartels at the top of the list, say analysts. 
<P>
   In 1989, then-president Bush established an alliance for an
Andean strategy to combat drug trafficking with the Colombian
president at the time, Virgilio Barco, and other presidents of the
region. 
<P>
   In the eight years of the Clinton government, bilateral
relations continued to be marked by the illegal drug issue and
suffered their worst moment under president Ernesto Samper (1994-
1998), due to allegations that his electoral campaign had been
financed by money coming from the drug cartels. 
<P>
   During that period, Washington gave Colombia a negative
evaluation of its fight against drug production and denied US
visas to Samper and several Colombian lawmakers. 
<P>
   Then, in 1998, ''the relations went from hell to heaven, due to
the fact that the US government considered Pastrana to be the
antithesis of Samper,'' said former foreign minister Rodrigo
Pardo. 
<P>
   Since the beginning of his presidential term, Pastrana has met
with Clinton five times, the latest being in Cartagena. The result
of the new phase of bilateral relations was the finalisation of
Plan Colombia, Pardo pointed out. 
<P>
   The Pastrana and Clinton governments define the Plan as ''an
integral strategy to fight drug trafficking, and for social
development, peace and strengthening the State.''
