<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The west's three permanent members of the UN Security Council account for 80% of the world's weapons sales at a time when it is incapable of mounting effective peacekeeping operations, according to a report published yesterday by a London-based thinktank. 
<P>The report, by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), is deeply sceptical about the EU's ability to realise its plans for an independent, 60,000-strong rapid-reaction force.  
<P>"European leaders speak of a European defence capacity but have not voted &#91;for&#93; the funds to finance it," said the IISS director, John Chipman.  
<P>The US increased its share of   the international arms trade last year and now accounts for nearly 50% of the $53.4bn (&#163;37bn) annual market, according to the IISS publication, the Military Balance.  
<P>Britain came second, selling nearly &#163;7bn worth of weapons, while France was third at almost &#163;4.6bn.  
<P>Much of these weapons systems were supplied to the Middle East, the world's biggest arms market. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest arms buyer, purchased more than &#163;4bn worth of weapons last year.  
<P>Taiwan was the largest arms importer in East Asia.  
<P>Middle Eastern countries spent &#163;42bn on defence last year, says the report, which also notes that the Israeli air force had set up its first anti-ballistic missile battery some 30 miles south of Tel Aviv.  
<P>The IISS damned the lack of government commitment to international peacekeeping.  
<P>"It remains the case that the UN continues to overreach, approving ambitious mandates and deploying inadequately supported forces in volatile situations," Mr Chipman said.  
<P>"The long-term aim of the UN operation in Sierra Leone is unclear and the capacity of the UN to make a sensible contribution to what is a hugely unstable situation in the Congo is questionable," he said.  
<P>UN member states were "incapable of producing the sometimes very large contingents that a proper operation would require," he said.   
<P>While defence spending increased in most regions of the world, including the US, spending by Nato's European members other than Britain and the three new entrants - Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic - continued to decline.  
<P>"Nato countries in Europe are feeling the strain of what looks like an increasingly lengthy commitment in Kosovo," the report said. "Even those with all-professional forces are finding they are over-committed in Europe and beyond."  
<P>"It remains doubtful whether the Europeans can realise their ambitions for a credible 60,000-strong independent force," it adds.  
<P>If the continent is unable to muster a credible independent force, Nato will have to remain   strongly involved in EU security. "European defence, in all but the most trivial of cases, will remain a transatlantic affair," Mr Chipman said.  
<P>Britain and France have invested considerable political and diplomatic capital in setting up a joint EU military force, which would conduct peacekeeping operations without US or Nato involvement  
<P>France wants to cap its six-month stint as EU president at the European summit in Nice in December with a firm commitment to set up a credible force with at least 60,000 troops.  
<P>&#149; 100,000 people were killed as a direct result of armed conflicts in the year up to August, 60% of them in sub-Saharan Africa, the IISS says.
