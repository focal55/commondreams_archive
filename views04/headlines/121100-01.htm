STOCKHOLM  - The Indonesian labour lawyer and human
rights
activist
Munir is among the four recipients of the 2000 Right Livelihood
Awards, also referred to as the Alternative Nobel Prize, presented
at a
ceremony in the Swedish parliament Friday.
<P>
Munir is one of the most devoted fighters for civilian control of
the
powerful Indonesian army. In his view, the key to a better
situation for
human rights in Indonesia is to destroy the culture of fear among
the
people. 
<P>
Founder-chairman of the award, Jakob von Uexkull, said at the
ceremony Friday:
''During the decades of authoritarian rule, we were told by
Suharto's Western
friends that different rules, rights and values applied in
Indonesia.'' 
<P>
Uexkull is a Swedish-German philatelic expert, who sold his
valuable postage
stamps to provide the original endowment for the awards. 
<P>
Alfred Nobel, who bestowed the Nobel Prizes, wanted to honour
those whose
work ''brought the greatest benefit to humanity''. But von Uexkull
felt that
Nobel Prizes tended to ignore much work and knowledge vital for
the survival
of humankind. 
<P>
The so-called Asian values were said to put greater emphasis on
community
rather than individual rights. 
<P>
''Add this to the rise of fundamentalism, the search for
scapegoats, the
unwillingness of the military to step back and accept the primacy
of
democracy - and you have an idea of the challenges facing Munir,''
added
Uexkull. 
<P>
As founder of the human rights organisation Kontras, the
Indonesian lawyer has
worked to encourage respect for due process of law and promote
reconciliation. 
<P>
He has developed media education for human rights and teaches
human rights in
police and army training seminars. He is a member of the
Commission to
Investigate Human Rights Violations in Timor and of the drafting
committee
for a law on human rights courts. 
<P>
''The biggest threat against a positive development towards
democracy in
Indonesia, besides the fact that the military still has a lot of
influence
in politics, is the culture of fear among our people,'' said Munir
at a
press conference Wednesday in Stockholm. 
<P>
Like many an Indonesian he only uses one name. 
<P>
''That is why my organisation Kontras' most important task right
now is to
build a network between ordinary individuals to change people's
minds after
years of totalitarianism. Human Rights is not only about law
suits, it's a
mass
movement,'' said Munir. 
<P>
Kontras, which stands for Commission for Disappearance and Victims
of
Violence, is a human rights organisation which focuses on fighting
political
and military violence, giving support to victims of violence to
recover
physically and psychologically and promoting reconciliation and
peace. 
<P>
The Right Livelihood Award was founded in 1980 to ''honour and
support those
offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent
challenges facing
us today''. 
<P>
Munir said: ''This award is very important for Kontras as a motive
to keep on
struggling for a better situation for human rights in Indonesia.
It will also
highlight these issues back home. 
<P>
''Our next goal is to reform the law to stop the impunity that are
now
given to
the military,'' said Munir. 
<P>
Although the power of the military indeed has decreased since the
ousting
of ex-president Suharto in 1998, the armed forces are still trying
to keep
the control of civil society and the bureaucracy on all levels,
according to
Munir. 
<P>
Munir is also the head of the operational division of Indonesian
Legal Aid
Foundation (YLBHI). He played an important part in some well-known
cases in
late 1997 and early 1998, including the one when 24 pro-democracy
activists
were abducted under suspicious circumstances. 
<P>
Thanks to the work of Munir, 11 students were released, but the
rest are still
missing. Eleven military officers were brought to trial in March
1999, as a
result of YLBHI's efforts. 
<P>
In September 1999 Munir was appointed a member of the Commission
to
Investigate Human Rights Violations in East Timor, which later led
to an
investigation into the conduct of six senior army officers,
including the
former chief of staff, General Wiranto. 
<P>
Besides Munir, this year's awards were given to activists from
Ethiopia,
Turkey and the United States. 
<P>
The Ethiopian scientist Tewolde Berhan Gebre Egziabher was awarded
for
''for his exemplary work in representing the Like-Minded Group of
developing
countries at the Biosafety negotiations in Cartagena and Montreal,
and
achieving an outcome that safeguards bio-diversity and the
traditional rights
of farmers and communities to their genetic resources''. 
<P>
The Turkish environmentalist Birsel Lemke was recognised ''for her
long-standing struggle to protect her country from the devastation
of
cyanide-based gold mining and her key role in the international
campaign to
ban
this disastrous technology''. 
<P>
''My work is also about human rights. Therefore I call on all
western
countries
to withdraw their support to the mine enterprises and respect the
Turkish constitution that says the human rights of each individual
must be
respected,'' said Lemke at a press conference Wednesday. 
<P>
The US plant geneticist Wes Jackson was honoured ''for his single-
minded
commitment over more than two decades to developing an agriculture
based on
perennial crops that is both highly productive and truly
ecologically
sustainable''. 
<P>
Together the award winners receive about 200,000 dollars.  
<P>
''All my money will be given to Kontras,'' said Munir. 
<P>
The of the Right Livelihood award are chosen by an international  
jury  
which includes Jakob von Uexkull, founder-chairman of the Right  
Livelihood 
Award. 
<P>
The award winners in the last two decades include Norway's Johann  
Galtung, 
known as the founder-father of research, who bagged the honour in  
1987. 
<P>
Six years later, Vandana Shiva of India was awarded the  
Alternative Nobel  
Prize for placing women and ecology at the heart of modern  
development  
discourse. 
<P>
In 1994, Ken Saro-Wiwa, founder of the MOSOP (Movement for the  
Survival of the 
Ogoni People) in Ogoniland, Nigeria, was decorated for exemplary  
courage in 
striving non-violently for the rights of the Ogoni people. 
<P>
In 1998, the Right Livelihood award was given to the International  
Baby  
Food Action Network (IBFAN), for its campaign for the right of  
mothers to  
breastfeed their babies.
