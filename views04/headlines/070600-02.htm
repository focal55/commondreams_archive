The activists who disrupted meetings of international agencies in
Seattle and Washington plan at least four mass marches, a candlelight
vigil and a bevy of other nonviolent acts during the Democratic National
Convention in August, according to leaders of the involved groups.
<p>The groups are scheduled to discuss their plans during a news
conference today in Washington, detailing their intentions to flood the
streets of Los Angeles with protesters to draw attention to what they see
as the corporate dominance of the economy, both globally and locally.
<p>The plans mark what activists say is a logical shift in the focus of
their protest, from the effects of esoteric global policies to domestic
issues such as police brutality, welfare and gay rights.
<p>"Whether you're looking at the global economy or the American
political system, they're both being controlled by the same people," said
Shawn McDougal, an organizer of the Los Angeles protests. "We need to
make them accountable to the people."
<p>Similar actions are scheduled for the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia.
<p>Despite ambitious plans to draw thousands of demonstrators to each
city, organizers of the effort stress that they expect their protests to
be peaceful and highly coordinated. Although the Seattle demonstrations
last year produced a violent clash in that city, there are no plans to
damage property or to provoke any violent confrontations in Los Angeles,
the organizers said.
<p>That pledge is in marked contrast to warnings issuing lately from the
Los Angeles Police Department. Officials there say they are committed to
protecting peaceful marches and speech, but they irritated some City
Council members last week when they showed a videotape of violent
demonstrations and decried rogue groups of "anarchists" that they said
were laying plans for the Los Angeles convention.
<p>Protest organizers say it is police who are ratcheting up tension, and
insist that they want to focus on their message: that the same forces are
behind the devastation of the Colombian rain forest and the suffering of
poor families in Compton.
<p>In essence, what the demonstration organizers hope to do is link broad
national and international themes with the nitty-gritty of local
politics. That would broaden their coalition and expand their relevance
in Los Angeles, where issues of transportation and police abuse are high
on the local agenda.
<p>It also provides another possible benefit for the organizers: Where
demonstrations against the World Trade Organization and the International
Monetary Fund have largely been the work of white activists, a richer mix
of themes may make the protests more attractive to a broader ethnic
spectrum of demonstrators.
<b><br>
<p>Groups Allege Links to Corporations
</b>
<p>The connections may at first seem nebulous--what exactly do the World
Trade Organization and, say, California's latest crackdown on juvenile
crime, one of the topics of expected protest, have in common?
<p>The WTO, activists assert, is a pawn of giant corporations that want
to boost their profits at the expense of the Third World.
<p>And corporations such as Chevron bankrolled Proposition 21, which
passed overwhelmingly at the polls this spring and made it easier for
youths to be tried as adults for certain crimes. If convicted, the
juveniles would go to state prisons such as San Quentin--where activists
say inmates have done data processing for Chevron for minimum wage.
<p>A Chevron spokesman scoffed at that argument, saying the company gave
money to the effort to place the initiative on the ballot because of a
request from then-Gov. Pete Wilson. "If the assertion is made that
Chevron benefits from prison labor because of this example you've cited
to me, that is ludicrous," said the spokesman, Fred Gorell.
<p>There still will be plenty of talk about international issues when the
Democrats are in town Aug. 14 through 17. But the still-evolving
itinerary for protests leans heavily toward local issues such as police
brutality and education, or global issues with Los Angeles implications,
such as immigration.
<p>Part of the reason for the shift is that demonstrators will be
targeting a domestic event rather than the meetings of the pillars of the
global economy--the WTO in Seattle last year and the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington this spring.
<p>But the change in focus is also part of an attempt to broaden a
movement that members acknowledge has been predominantly white and middle
class.
<p>"There is an activist koan that white people pick their issue and
brown-skinned people have their issue picked for them," said John
Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society, a roving boot-camp for
protesters. "To have the luxury to look at this monster called
globalization is an easy thing to do if you have the time and aren't
worrying about racial profiling" and making ends meet.
<p>Los Angeles organizers will be joined at the news conference today by
their counterparts from Philadelphia, which will host the Republican
National Convention two weeks before the Democrats come to Los Angeles
and is also expected to be the site of numerous protests.
<p>The venue--the National Press Club, where pillars of the establishment
are more frequent guests than maverick leftists--demonstrates both the
increasing interest in the activists and their high level of nationwide
coordination.
<p>Organizers in the two cities have been coordinating their plans since
the spring. Both conventions will feature mass marches the Sunday before
business begins, then "theme days" capped with mass marches during the
convention itself. Neither convention has been overtly targeted for
disruption by these organizers, in contrast to the protests in Seattle
and Washington.
<p>Los Angeles' protests are scheduled to kick off with a march in
support of death row inmate Mumia Abu Jamal, a Philadelphia activist,
journalist and convicted cop killer who supporters contend was framed.
<p>On Monday, as the convention opens, the stated theme is broad--"Human
Needs, not Corporate Greed." On Tuesday, the issues are to be racism, gay
rights and any others covered by the slogan "An injury to one is an
injury to all." Police brutality and the growth of prisons will be the
subject of Wednesday protests.
<p>And on Thursday, as the convention ends, activists are scheduled to
focus on immigration and issues of global justice. A candlelight vigil is
scheduled to coincide with the acceptance speech Thursday night of the
expected Democratic presidential nominee, Al Gore.
<p>It's challenging to itemize all the issues expected to come up in
August protests. The Web page of the group coordinating the
activism--D2kla.org--lists a total of 23 causes, plus "all forms of
oppression that divide people worldwide."
<p>In keeping with the decentralized philosophy of the new protest
movement, organizers say they mainly want to create a framework in which
a variety of groups can express their own issues.
<p>But members of the coordinating group, dubbed the D2K Network, say
there are unifying messages behind the wide range of causes.
<p>"We each have our own particular causes," said activist Mary Kalyna.
"But we are all in the same boat."
<p>Kalyna's causes include gay rights and issues involving the disabled.
She sees them as connecting with issues of globalization through
government's refusal to pay people who care for the disabled a living
wage and the allocation of public money to prison construction and the
military instead of to increasing access.
<p>A growing number of activists in the past year have been drawing such
connections, but the focus so far has been on so-called "structural
adjustment programs" and their effects on the Third World. The term
refers to requirements by the International Monetary Fund that countries
in need of loans privatize some state-owned industries and increase
efficiencies.
<p>But activists say the same dynamics occur in the U.S. and especially
in Los Angeles. "What's happening to the bus system is like structural
adjustment in the U.S.," said Ted Robertson of the Bus Riders Union,
which plans to join in the August protests to voice its long-standing
complaints that the Metropolitan Transportation Agency short-changes
buses for rail construction backed by big business.
<p>Other issues activists cite are welfare reform, immigration and the
increasing numbers of blacks and Latinos incarcerated in a growing number
of prisons--the so-called "prison-industrial complex"--all of which
activists see as methods to increase the supply of cheap labor available
to corporations.
<b><br>
<p>Hoping to Expand Protest Coalition
</b>
<p>In Seattle, unions opposed to jobs being shipped overseas, and
environmentalists dressed as sea turtles protesting the toll of that work
in the Third World, came together to form a memorable coalition. Those
activists succeeded in shutting down the conference and electrifying the
left, but the ensuing clashes with police angered many people and
heightened anxiety about the events planned for this summer.
<p>Activists are hoping to expand that coalition in Los Angeles.
<p>"You will have labor, you will have the turtles and you will have
welfare mothers--that's the new element," said Margaret Prescod, a
veteran activist whose Los Angeles-based organization deals with mothers'
issues.
<p>The activists who have been coordinating the nationwide battle against
globalization have been waiting for that new element--and the diversity
it could bring--for some time.
<p>In Washington, D.C., only a relatively small number of blacks joined
protests against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, even
though the events occurred in a city with an African American majority.
<p>After those April protests, activist Lisa Fithian attended a meeting
of activists in Washington, D.C., planning protests at the conventions
and realized that everyone there was white. This will be different in Los
Angeles, she vowed.
<p>But activists acknowledge that they have an uphill battle to get a
truly representative mix of people on the streets.
<p>They attribute that difficulty partly to the massive police presence
expected at the convention. Prescod, who is black, spoke of the fear many
African Americans have of merely seeing an officer while driving. "Your
heart starts beating faster . . . and that's only one cop, not a wall" of
them, she said.
<p>Michael Zinzun, a longtime local activist against police brutality who
is black, said that he has agreed to speak during the convention protests
and that he agrees with organizers' analysis of how local and global
issues are connected.
<p>While expressing hope for getting police abuse issues out to a
national audience, he had a reminder for the thousands of out-of-town
protesters who are expected to descend on the city.
<p>"They're going to come and they're going to go back, but I'm still
going to be poor, and there's still going to be police brutality," Zinzun
said. "I understand people's inspiration, but they should be inspired for
the long haul and not just jump in the streets."
