<p>After years of dousing mink coats with red paint and clamoring for the release of monkeys from research labs, animal rights advocates are making their case in a far less contentious way -- teaching at some of the country's top law schools.
<p> Students this year at Harvard, Duke and Georgetown universities have begun the first concentrated study of the legal st ruggles for animals.<p> As discoveries in genetics and neuroscience increasingly blur the distinction between animals and humans, lawyers have generated enough precedent-setting judgments to define an entirely new field of study. Animal law has, consequently, taken a large leap forward since 1981 when the national animal rights movement began in earnest after police seized 17 monkeys in a raid at a Silver Spring research lab.<p> "It is timely," explained Alan Ray, assistant dean for academic affairs at Harvard Law School. "We felt the course would respond to a growing student interest and to growing scholarship in the field. We're not making any broader statement of policy about animal rights, but we do believe there are legitimate issues raised that deserve consideration about the legal status of nonhuman animals."<p> Harvard hired Massachusetts attorney Steven Wise to teach its first course. Wise recently published a book arguing for animal legal rights, "Rattling the Cage," which was lauded by primatologist Jane Goodall as "the animals' Magna Carta."<p> A scholarly, self-effacing man, Wise has devoted 20 years as a lawyer to defending dogs, speaking on behalf of chimpanzees, dolphins and parrots and being humiliated by judges who sometimes berate him for bringing animal cases to their courts.<p> Finding that his mission has earned this degree of credibility is satisfying.<p> "The ideas are becoming accepted much quicker than I would have thought," he said.<p> Legal rights expected<p> In the next decade, Wise expects to make a case that chimpanzees and bonobos (a close primate relative) share enough similarities with humans to be be granted fundamental legal rights. This would effectively protect them from hunters and traders, end their use in biomedical research and give their advocates power to sue on their behalf.<p> Critics acknowledge an increase in litigation in the field, but to suggest that animals should have legal rights is more than some can stomach.<p> "I do not regard myself as an `animal-is-a-thing' person," said University of Chicago professor Richard Epstein, who has become one of the few legal scholars to publicly question the law school trend. "That's a grotesque position. But we can't falsify what we know as the truth about evolution and human behavior. Animals aren't human beings."<p> Advocates point to scientific evidence suggesting that chimpanzees and humans diverged from the same evolutionary path and that their DNA is nearly 98.5 percent identical.<p> A recent report assisting their argument appeared last summer in the influential journal Nature showing that chimpanzees in the wild create complex social communities that, like human societies, develop into distinctly different cultures.<p> Other studies describe certain animals' social behaviors such as tool-making, courtship and grooming, and other research suggests that chimps and bonobos can count and communicate with language.<p> Consciousness disputed<p> With so many sophisticated qualities, Wise believes, chimps and bonobos demonstrate they are conscious beings deserving not just human protection, but legal rights.<p> Again, critics disagree.<p> "I think Steve Wise has a great mission," said Harvard's Marc Hauser, an authority in animal cognition and author of the forthcoming book "Wild Minds: What Animals Think." "He wants to make sure animals aren't dismissed as property, and I'm 100 percent behind that. On the other hand, when he crosses disciplines, his reading and understanding of animals is not how I interpret them. He promotes stuff I don't think is easily justified."<p> For example, Hauser said, even though chimps share some cognitive similarities with humans, they do not seem to understand what others know, think, believe and desire -- qualities often listed by researchers as necessary for equating them with humans.<p> "We have to be careful about ascribing human motivations and reactions to animal behaviors," he said, "or suggesting that we know what's going on in their hearts and minds when we just don't have it yet."<p> Nonetheless, public regard for greater legal protections seems to be increasing. Last week in Seattle, after acrimonious debate about mistreatment of elephants and other circus animals, the City Council came very close to endorsing an ordinance banning circus animals from the town. In San Francisco recently, the local animal control commission recommended adding the term "pet guardians" to official documents describing the relationship between pets and their human companions.<p> In the past six years, the number of states with felony violations for animal cruelty has risen from six to 27. A week ago, a teen-ager in Oregon accused of killing a dog by dragging it behind his car was sentenced to up to 10 years at a state training school under a felony anti-cruelty law.<p> "That would have been unthinkable five years ago," said Pamela Frasch, a Portland, Ore., attorney and an author of the field's first case book, "Animal Law." "But it's a step toward legal rights when anti-cruelty laws like that are upgraded to felonies. It increases public awareness that animals are not just things, but creatures that feel pain and have awareness and deserve to be treated like more than inanimate objects."<p> Sympathy from the bench<p> Even in some civil cases, lawyers such as Wise and Frasch see indications that judges are warming to the idea of animal rights.<p> In 1998, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted "standing" -- a legal term that gives an injured person the right to take a grievance to court -- to a man who claimed he suffered "aesthetic injury" after witnessing unsuitable living conditions of monkeys in a Long Island zoo. Although the man lost his case, the fact that the court granted him standing was counted as a major victory.<p> Although observers say these represent incremental change, Wise hopes these discrete successes will embolden judges to accept cases that will create enough common law to build a foundation for a landmark judgment.<p> "As in comedy, timing is everything in the law," Wise said. "I don't think we will see the first successful lawsuit [establishing animal rights] for another eight or 10 years. But in the meantime, we can begin to establish principles in areas of common law, even in cases that don't seem relevant. Once established, they can be tested and eventually applied in a broader sense."<p> In his law practice, Wise files malpractice cases where pets have been killed accidentally by veterinarians so he can establish precedents for awards based on the emotional distress of the animals' "human companions," as in wrongful-death cases of a human family member. With a few cases on record where lawyers have persuaded courts to award such damages, animal rights advocates can point to examples where animals are no longer considered mere property whose loss can be limited to their market value.<p> Promising advances<p> If the crusade sometimes seems little more than quixotic, Wise and his colleagues point to how relatively quickly the sciences and the law have advanced, promising a wholesale change in society's attitudes about animals.<p> Few would understand that evolution as well as Wise, who in 1968 first became conscious of animal rights when he was an 8-year-old boy wandering around a farmers' market off Pulaski Highway in Baltimore. He noticed a cluster of scrawny chicks packed into a box for quick sale and decided to write to his <a href="http://www.co.ha.md.us" target="offsitewindow">Harford County</a> legislator condemning the deplorable treatment.<p> Thirty-two years later, with gathering interest from prominent legal and scientific scholars, he at last has an audience.<p> "Lawyers are coming out of the woodwork to learn about this," Wise said. "With the books and courses out there, they're more comfortable making their interests known. They can't be accused any longer of wasting time on an area that's frivolous."<p><FOOTER> <P><I>Originally published on Feb 25 2000</I>
