The chairman of Nike, Phil Knight, 
will  not make  a planned $30 million 
contribution to help his alma mater, 
the University of Oregon, renovate 
its athletic stadium because the 
university joined a factory monitoring group other than the one he 
supports, a senior Nike official said 
yesterday.

<p> Mr. Knight, a billionaire who heads 
the world's largest footwear company, has given about $30 million to the 
university over the last decade, but 
company officials said he was disturbed that the university joined the 
Workers Rights Consortium, a student-backed  monitoring group.

<p> Nike, which has faced  criticism 
over working conditions in its overseas factories, has often faulted the 
consortium for being unfriendly to 
apparel and footwear manufacturers. Nike is an enthusiastic member 
of another monitoring group, the 
Fair Labor Association, a White 
House-backed organization that, unlike the Workers Rights Consortium, 
has apparel companies on its board.

<p> In a statement, Nike said: "The 
University of Oregon, despite its 
unique relationship with Nike and 
Phil, is free to align itself with the 
Workers Rights Consortium. However, it does not mean that we are 
required to support those efforts 
with which we have fundamental disagreements."

<p> The University of Oregon, based in 
Eugene, has been developing plans to 
renovate and expand Autzen Stadium, a project that is expected to 
cost $80 million. University officials 
said they still 
hoped to  talk 
with Mr. Knight 
to see whether 
he might reconsider  his decision.

<p>  Randy Newnham, a university senior  and a 
coordinator of 
the Survival 
Center, which  supports social justice 
and human rights, criticized Mr. 
Knight's decision. 

<p> "It's kind of amusing, considering 
that he's upset that we joined some 
labor-monitoring body," Mr. Newnham said. "He keeps claiming that 
his company is socially responsible 
and they don't use sweatshop labor. 
If that's the case, why is he so upset 
that we joined this monitoring 
group? It kind of implies that something isn't quite up to par."

<p>  Over the last six months, student 
groups at dozens of campuses have 
held sit-ins and demonstrations to 
pressure their universities to join the 
Workers Rights Consortium, instead 
of the Fair Labor Association. The 
consortium, set up by students with 
the backing of several labor unions, 
now has 45 universities as members. 
It  monitors overseas factories that 
make hats, T-shirts and other apparel that are made under license and 
carry a university's logo.

<p> The students assert that the Fair 
Labor Association is dominated by 
corporations and will not be vigorous 
in its monitoring. Its  members include several consumer groups, human rights groups and 130 colleges.

<p>  Nike officials criticize the consortium's  makeup and its requirement 
for surprise monitoring visits. 

<p>  "We object to the Workers Rights 
Consortium because it does not provide a seat on the table for companies," said Vada Manager, a Nike 
spokesman.   
<p> "Another issue is it has 
a 'gotcha' monitoring system, which 
in our minds is not a serious way to 
achieve the common goal that we all 
want to achieve, which is to eradicate sweatshop conditions."

<p>     To  pressure  Nike, United Students Against Sweatshops, the umbrella group backing the consortium, 
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial 
and Textile Employees and other 
groups issued a report yesterday 
that criticized Nike for using  sweatshops. The report faults Nike for 
doing  much of its production in China, where independent unions are 
prohibited and where, the report 
said, workers are paid at most $1.50 
for a pair of shoes that sells for $100.

<p> Nike officials assert that the company has made great strides in improving its factories,  that they do 
more monitoring than most companies and that their  factories usually 
pay more than other factories in the 
regions where they are situated.

<p> Last month, Nike said it was ending its agreement to supply Brown 
University's hockey teams  after 
Brown joined the consortium. Brown 
officials said Nike's move resulted 
from miscommunication. 

<p> Nicholas Reville, a Brown junior 
active in United Students Against 
Sweatshops, said Nike and Mr. 
Knight moved against Brown and the 
University of Oregon, to warn other 
universities against join the Workers 
Rights Consortium.
