Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader blitzed 
through Northern California yesterday buoyed by polls that indicated 
he could cost Democrat Al Gore as many as 37 electoral votes.	 

<P>  ``If I was worried about that, I wouldn't have run,'' Nader said 
in an interview with The Chronicle last night as he rode from a 
fund-raiser to his rally in Davis. ``I want to defeat him. I want to 
defeat (George W.) Bush. I want to take more votes than I can 
possibly dream of.''	 
</P>
<P>  Nader has amassed enough support in five critical states -- 
Minnesota, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington -- to effect 
races where the Bush-Gore matchup is a statistical dead heat, 
pollsters note. And even where his support is not as strong, in a 
handful of other battleground states such as Florida and 
Pennsylvania, the former consumer advocate now also has strong 
potential to affect Gore's fortunes.

</font>``This seems to be a race where there are going to be anywhere 
from a dozen to 20 states that could be decided on four points or 
less,'' said Gore pollster Paul Maslin. ``And in nearly all of those 
states, Nader could make the difference and could cost Gore a 
victory.''
<P>  News of a Nader surge came as the candidate hopscotched across 
California this weekend, drawing a standing room only crowd of 7,000 
cheering supporters to a rally at the Henry J. Kaiser Center in 
Oakland on Saturday. Yesterday, he hit campaign events in Walnut 
Creek and Davis, and will be in Palo Alto tonight.	 
</P>
<P>  But with just over two weeks before election day, Nader's final 
push has increased the possibility of his campaign, once considered a 
mere political asterisk, swinging the outcome of the battle between 
Bush and Gore.	 
</P>
<P> In Oakland, Nader outright rejected the pleas of a dozen former 
followers calling themselves ``Nader's Raiders for Gore'' who 
released a letter Friday calling on him to reconsider his candidacy 
now that the election has become the closest since 1960 -- when John 
F. Kennedy won by one vote per precinct.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It is now clear that you might well give the White House to 
Bush,'' wrote Nader's former colleagues, who said they worked with 
him between 1969 and 1984. ``As a result, you would set back 
significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your 
entire, astonishing career . . . ''	 
</P>
<P>  In the interview, Nader said his focus is not on the other two 
candidates but on the step-by-step process of creating a third party.	 
</P>
<P>  ``We're building a party,'' he said. ``You don't build it in a 
day. You go to a certain stage on Nov. 7th, with millions of votes, 
then you become a watchdog with the only message that these two 
parties understand. You say we got millions of votes on this round, 
and you guys either shape up with these reforms that the American 
people want, or you're going to lose even more votes to Green Party 
candidates in the next election.''	 
</P>
<P>  Nader also denied accusations by the ``Nader's Raiders'' that he 
assured them he would never campaign in states where he would damage 
a chance for a Gore win.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I never said that,'' Nader said. ``Why would anybody ever run 
for president if they were worried about taking votes away from all 
the other candidates? That's what you do in a presidential run.''	 
</P>
<P>  Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo said yesterday that Nader's 
recent boosts are due to ``a decline for Gore in the last two 
weeks.''	 
</P>
<P>  ``It doesn't look as if Gore rallied the troops,'' DiCamillo said 
of apparent voter sentiment after fact, some of his supporters pulled 
away from him.''	 
</P>
<P>   Still unclear, said Gore pollster Maslin, is how many current 
likely Nader voters would have ever been in Gore's camp.	 
</P>
<P>  ``A good half of Nader's vote . . . is going nowhere else,'' he 
said, but the other half ``could slip back to Gore if they felt the 
need. If they don't, it will hurt Gore.''	 
</P>
<P>   Nader followers at this weekend's energetic Oakland rally, like 
John Vance -- selling popular bumper stickers emblazoned with the 
slogan, ``George W. Bush: Serial Killer'' -- said that progressives 
aren't at all nervous about the possibility of Nader's candidacy 
affecting the major two party candidates.	 
</P>
<P> ``If George Bush is elected, more people will get active in the 
protest movement,'' he said. ``You can count on it.'' 	 
</P>
<P>  Such talk both concerns and infuriates Democrats.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Nader wants to become the No. 1 adversary of the Republican 
Party. . . and he's become a politician who is committed to setting 
back progressive causes for decades for his own gain,'' said state 
Democratic Party campaign chairman Bob Mulholland. 	 
</P>
<P>  But the bottom line is now ``a triple threat,'' for Gore, said 
Maslin. ``(Republicans) have more money, they have more enthusiasm 
and energy in their base, and they don't have a third party drag. So 
it's obviously cause for concern right now.''

NADER COUNTRY<br>
<br>
Battleground states where significant support for Nader is most 
likely to make a difference:	 
<P>   -- Minnesota (10 electoral votes): Nader has doubled his support 
from 4 points to 8 points in the most recent Minneapolis Star-Tribune 
poll, and Bush leads Gore by three points, 44-41.	 
</P>
<P>   -- Oregon (7 votes): The latest American Research poll shows Gore 
besting Bush by a slim 44-43, Nader at 6.	 
</P>
<P>   -- Washington (11 votes): Gore leads Bush 45-43, with Nader at 5.	 
</P>
<P>   -- Maine (4 votes): A Critical Insights poll shows 42 percent for 
Bush, 37 percent for Gore, with 11 percent for ``other.'' Pollsters 
say a significant number are for Nader. 	 
</P>
<P>   -- New Mexico (5 votes): The race is in a dead heat for Bush and 
Gore with Nader at 5 percent.	 
</P>
<P>Other states where the race is close enough that support for 
Nader could affect Gore:	 
</P>
<P>   Florida (25 votes), Michigan (11 votes), Missouri (11 votes), 
Pennsylvania (23 votes).
