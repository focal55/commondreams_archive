Dogged 
by years of controversy over its mission and its graduates, the Army's 
School of the Americas is on the 
verge of getting a new charter, a new 
curriculum and a new name. It appears likely, however, to face the 
same old protests.

<p> The Army's plans to reorganize 
the school, which has trained generations of soldiers from Central America and South America, cleared a 
major hurdle this week when the 
House narrowly rejected an amendment that would have closed it down.

<p> If the Senate goes along, as expected, the school that critics have linked 
to human rights violations  by former 
students will officially "close" and 
"reopen" later this year as the Defense Institute for Hemispheric Security Cooperation.

<p> The Army proposed the changes 
last month, prompted by rising opposition to the school from religious 
groups and, more importantly, from 
some members of Congress, who 
nearly succeeded in cutting off the 
school's financing last year.

<p> Opened in Panama in 1946 and 
moved to its current location at Fort 
Benning, Ga., in 1984, the school has 
been the primary training ground for 
more than 60,000 Latin American 
military and police.   
<p>Some were later 
implicated in the region's most notorious abuses, like the murder of six 
Jesuit priests in El Salvador in 1989.

<p> The secretary of the Army, Louis 
Caldera, said in an interview that 
critics have unfairly tarnished the 
school's reputation because of the 
actions of very few. Nonetheless, he 
said, the changes would give the 
school a focus that was more academic and less strictly military. 

<p> "I thought it would be a mistake to 
close the school down," Mr. Caldera 
said, "because that would be turning 
our backs on the countries of Latin 
America."

<p> Because Congress chartered the 
school, the Army had to seek approval for its changes. 

<p> In addition to having a new name, 
the school would have an advisory 
board to review its curriculum and 
report to Congress. Authority over 
the school would be transferred from 
the Army to the Department of Defense, and students would be required to have at least eight hours of 
instruction in human rights in each 
course.

<p> Mr. Caldera said the Army would 
try to increase the number of civilian 
students, and emphasize training political and military leaders in the 
proper role of the military under the 
region's emerging democratic governments.

<p> The school would remain at Fort 
Benning and still offer courses involving purely military tactics and 
strategies, prompting opponents to 
denounce the changes as cosmetic.

<p> When the Army's proposal came 
before the House on Thursday as 
part of the defense authorization bill, 
four members sponsored an amendment to shut the school and create a 
committee to review military training for Latin Americans.

<p> "Even with a new coat of paint, the 
School of the Americas has trained 
far too many killers of innocent people to remain a part of our foreign 
policy," said one of the sponsors, 
Representative John J. Moakley, 
Democrat of Massachusetts. 

<p> But the amendment lost on a roll-call vote of 214 to 204 after lobbying 
by Army, Pentagon and Clinton administration officials. A day before 
the vote, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Secretary of State 
Madeleine K. Albright sent members 
a joint letter saying the Army's proposal would "allow us to move past 
what had become a contentious annual debate on the school's legacy 
and focus on the question of how best 
to engage militarily our friends and 
allies in the hemisphere."

<p> The Army's proposal won approval when the House overwhelmingly 
approved the larger authorization 
bill late Thursday.

<p> The Rev. Roy L. Bourgeois, a 
priest who has organized protests 
against the school for a decade from 
his apartment at Fort Benning's 
main gate, said the changes would 
not diminish the movement against 
the school. The protests have grown 
from a handful of opponents to a 
crowd in November that was estimated at more than 8,000.

<p> "After thinking this thing out, we 
realized what they're really talking 
about is a name change," he said in a 
telephone interview today. "For us, 
this is the same old school doing 
what it's always been doing."
