<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) has endorsed Vice President
      Al Gore in his bid for the White House, he doesn't hide his enthusiasm
      about the issues raised by Ralph Nader's presidential candidacy.

      
<P>Wellstone told The Hill that he agrees with Nader on almost
      every issue but one.</P>
<P>&quot;The only disagreement is that I'm not supporting a third
      party effort,&quot; he laughed. &quot;I'm just not in the Green
      Party.&quot;</P>
<P>The second-term Minnesota senator explained matter-of-factly
      that his endorsement for president was not a difficult decision.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm supporting the vice president in this race,&quot;
      Wellstone said in the form of a disclaimer. &quot;I've always
      said that I'm a Democrat, and that's who I support.&quot;</P>
<P>Yet, Gore was not Wellstone's first choice. The liberal themes
      of former Sen. Bill Bradley's (D-N.J) campaign mixed nicely with
      the issues Wellstone is most passionate about.</P>
<P>&quot;I thought that Bill's focus on the poverty of children
      was heart and soul,&quot; he said. &quot;I would have supported
      him on that alone.&quot;</P>
<P>But, the crash and burn of the Bradley campaign left the Democrats
      with only one contender. And the vice president was quick to
      court members of Congress who had supported Bradley, and, in
      turn, Wellstone was quick to endorse Gore.</P>
<P>&quot;About two days after Bradley bowed out, the vice president
      came to Minnesota,&quot; Wellstone recalled.</P>
<P>Yet, on many fronts, Nader's campaign follows the liberal
      line of Bradley's much closer to Wellstone's political philosophy
      than Gore's middle-of-the-road stances. Wellstone naturally gravitates
      to the same issues.</P>
<P>&quot;I think Ralph and I are in agreement on the key issues
      in the country - reform to health care, to the education system,
      to the right to organize,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>Labor is one area through which Wellstone and Nader continue
      to walk together, while Gore and the Democratic Party have wandered
      in search of, perhaps, more lucrative pastures.</P>
<P>&quot;The Democrats have institutionalized their indifference
      to organized labor,&quot; Nader recently said. &quot;Instead
      they're taking them for granted, and knowing it! Knowing it.&quot;</P>
<P>Specifically, the Minnesota senator and legendary consumer
      advocate are in agreement in their opposition to granting permanent
      normal trade relations (PNTR) to China. Both are adamant about
      taking human rights issues and the right to organize labor unions
      into account before the thoughts of business deals and economic
      interests.</P>
<P>Yet, while Wellstone shares many of the same ideas with Nader,
      he is careful to not use the words &quot;support&quot; or &quot;endorse&quot;
      when speaking of the man.</P>
<P>&quot;Ralph Nader is someone who I've always admired, and
      I continue to,&quot; Wellstone said. &quot;He continues to command
      my respect. There are a lot of issues that he's talking about
      that are important for the country.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The inequalities in the country - [Nader is] never afraid
      to take on the special interests,&quot; he continued, but was
      quick to promote the Democrat: &quot;The vice president is saying
      some of that stuff, as well.&quot;</P>
<P>Wellstone said that he and Nader are friends, but not in the
      personal sense.</P>
<P>&quot;We've known each other for a long time,&quot; he said.
      &quot;He's not someone who we get together with on the holidays.
      [But] he's a friend.&quot;</P>
<P>Many Democrats have kept their distance from Nader and the
      Green Party for fear of undermining the efforts of their own
      candidate. </P>
<P>However, Wellstone defended his stance on Nader, and didn't
      foresee troubles or criticism from others in the Democratic Party.</P>
<P>&quot;It's not based on any formal support,&quot; he said.
