<p>The Microsoft Corporation has quietly hired Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, to lobby Mr. Bush in opposition to the government's antitrust case against the software giant.
<p>Microsoft's aim, the company says, is to curry favor with the apparent Republican presidential nominee, hoping he will speak out against the government's case -- and, perhaps, take a softer approach toward the company if he is elected president.
<p>Mr. Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition, is well situated to take on the assignment since his firm, Century Strategies, is one of Mr. Bush's top consultants. During the primary campaign, Mr. Reed frequently appeared on television to talk on behalf of the campaign. 
<p>&nbsp;Today, Mr. Reed declined to talk 
about his company's contract with 
Microsoft, saying, "We have a policy 
of not discussing our clients." Another executive of his company, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Microsoft had hired Century 
Strategies to lobby other political 
candidates as well.

<p>

<p> Mark Murray, a spokesman for 
Microsoft, said the company had 
hired Century Strategies to counter 
"a comprehensive lobbying campaign by our competitors" to promote the government's suit. The 
company also said it had been 
"working very hard to get our point 
of view across to all the presidential 
candidates," including Vice President Al Gore. Microsoft has not said 
how it has lobbied Mr. Gore and his 
staff.

<p> Last week, a federal judge found 
Microsoft in wide violation of antitrust laws. And in large part because 
of the government antitrust suit, Microsoft has been trying to make 
friends among the candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike.

<p> An accounting by the Center for 
Responsive Politics shows that, during the current election season, Microsoft and its employees have donated more than $727,000 to political 
parties -- 53 percent of it to the 
Republicans and 47 percent to Democrats.

<p> One obvious goal, while the antitrust case drags through a year or 
more of appeals, is to convince the 
next president, Congress and the 
public that the case should be abandoned. But the current campaign by 
Mr. Reed's company is much more 
closely aimed at the Bush campaign.

<p> A series of e-mail messages from 
John Pudner, senior project manager for Century Strategies, laid out 
a detailed plan by Mr. Reed's staff 
and his contractors to recruit senior 
Bush supporters from around the 
country in an effort to undermine the 
government's suit.

<p> The Bush supporters -- and the e-mail showed that Mr. Pudner is 
screening them carefully to make 
sure they are influential within the 
campaign -- are being asked to write 
letters to Mr. Bush saying they believe the government's case is misguided, and that the American people oppose it.

<p> Mr. Pudner's e-mail messages instruct "state operatives" of the firm 
to send him biographical information 
about Bush supporters who could 
help influence the Bush campaign. 

<p> Only after he has verified that the 
supporters are sufficiently influential are the regional lobbyists, working on contract for Century Strategies, authorized to solicit more letters.

<p> He said that the company intended 
to gather the letters through the end 
of this month. "We will reject letters 
that are not from someone" the company counts as influential, he wrote.

<p> The e-mails were made available 
to The New York Times by a recipient who did not agree with the goals 
of the campaign. One lobbyist said 
Century Strategies was offering the 
regional contractors $300 a letter -- 
a high price for this sort of work.
