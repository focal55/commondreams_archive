A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by
critics of agricultural biotechnology who want the government to
require labels on foods made with genetically engineered crops.
<p>The lawsuit challenged the Food and Drug Administration's
8-year-old policy that considers gene-altered crops to be
essentially the same as those produced by conventional breeding
methods and thus not subject to the same regulatory controls as
food additives.
<p>U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, in a ruling Sept.
29, said the biotech critics failed to prove that FDA violated
procedural and environmental laws in establishing the policy or
that the agency should mandate labeling of the foods.
<p>Unless the agency decides biotech ingredients are materially
different from conventional products, it ``lacks a basis upon which
it can legally mandate labeling, regardless of consumer demand,''
she wrote.
<p>Genetically engineered crops, herbicide-resistant soybeans in
particular, became popular with farmers in the late 1990s and are
found in products throughout supermarkets.
<p>The FDA policy was established in 1992 in the last year of the
Bush administration and has been defended vigorously by the Clinton
administration. FDA officials announced this spring that they would
propose mandatory safety reviews of new gene-altered products but
they insist they still believe the foods are safe. Such reviews are
now on a voluntary basis.
<p>The lawsuit was filed in 1998 by several anti-biotech
organizations, including The Center for Food Safety, and a group of
scientists and religious leaders.
<p>They don't plan to appeal the decision and will instead wait to
see what rules FDA proposes for the mandatory reviews, said Andrew
Kimbrell, an attorney who handled the lawsuit. Industry officials
say the FDA rules are unlikely to make much difference in how foods
are brought to market.
<p>``Genetically engineered foods have gone virtually unregulated
in the United States,'' he said Tuesday.
<p>Anti-biotech groups also are likely to challenge the
Environmental Protection Agency as it decides in coming months
whether to renew registrations for several varieties of corn that
have been genetically modified to resist insect pests, Kimbrell
said.
<p>The biotechnology industry has been on the defensive in recent
weeks because of a nationwide recall by Kraft Foods last month of
taco shells that were found to contain a variety gene-altered corn
that hasn't been approved for human consumption.
<p>The decision ``reinforces the integrity of the system, which is
based on sound science, at a time when this system is under
discussion,'' said Michael Phillips, who directs agricultural
issues for the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
<p>The FDA said this week that its own lab confirmed the corn was
in the taco shells and said it planned to test additional products.
<p>The corn, known as StarLink, is the only biotech crop that is
not approved for food use. Aventis CropScience, which developed the
corn variety, has agreed to reimburse the government for buying all
of this year's crop to ensure that it does not get into the food
supply again. EPA allows the corn to be used only for animal feed
because of unresolved questions about whether it could cause
allergic reactions in people.
