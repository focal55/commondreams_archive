In a victory for multinational
corporations and other forces for economic globalisation, the US
Supreme Court Monday struck down a Massachusetts law that
penalised companies doing business in Burma.
<P>
The case, which took two years to reach the Court, has major
implications for grassroots human-rights and environmental
activism. 
<P>
It puts into question the future of such "selective purchasing"
laws used by state and local governments over 25 years to pressure
companies to withdraw from apartheid South Africa and, more
recently, from Cuba, Nigeria, and Switzerland, among other
countries. 
<P>
"It invalidates all state and local sanctions aimed at Burma and
sends an extremely strong message to states and local governments
that they should not be in the business of making foreign policy,"
said Greg Costanias, the lead attorney for the National Foreign
Trade Council (NFTC), an association of some 600 companies which
brought the lawsuit. 
<P>
Supporters of the Massachusetts law, on the other hand, insisted
that the Court's opinion did not go that far. "It's a yellow
light; not a red light (for selective-purchasing laws)," said
Robert Stumberg, a law professor at Georgetown University who
helped Massachusetts prepare its case.  
<P>
Other Burma campaigners said they will introduce new laws designed
to punish companies doing business in Burma in other ways in
coming months. 
<P>
The case, which was filed by the NFTC in 1998, is based on a law
approved by the Massachusetts legislature in 1996. It required
companies doing business in Burma to add 10 percent to all of its
bids for procurement contracts with the state.  
<P>
Such selective-purchasing laws are designed to force companies to
choose between continuing to do business with repressive
governments abroad and bidding on often-lucrative state or local
governments contracts.  
<P>
Such laws were used most successfully during the late 1970s and
1980s to force scores of US multinationals - including such giants
as Coca-Cola, IBM, and General Motors - to withdraw from South
Africa. According to most experts, the resulting divestment played
a major role in bringing about majority rule there. 
<P>
Some two dozen states and cities, including New York, Los Angeles,
Minneapolis, and San Francisco have enacted similar laws against
companies doing business in Burma, where a military junta has
repressed the democratic opposition led by Nobel Peace Laureate
Aung San Suu Kyi. As a result, some of the country's best-known
companies, including several from the retail apparel industry,
withdrew.  
<P>
Multinationals naturally oppose these initiatives because they
curb companies' freedom to do business where they please. Until
the NFTC lawsuit, however, they were reluctant to challenge these
laws in court due to the negative publicity that would result from
a company claiming a right to do business with abusive
governments. 
<P>
The NFTC was backed by the European Union (EU) and Japan whose
companies were also affected by the Massachusetts law. Claiming
that Massachusetts had violated a multilateral ban on sub-national
governments using non-economic criteria in deciding contract bids,
they also filed challenges to the law in the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) and amicus curiae briefs with the courts here
in support of the NFTC. 
<P>
The Clinton administration, which was deeply split on the issue,
stayed out of the case until last February when it submitted its
own brief arguing that the Massachusetts law had violated the US
constitution by "impermissibly infring(ing) upon the national
government's exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs." 
<P>
That position echoed the judgements of the district court in
Massachusetts and the appeals court both of which decided the case
on sweeping constitutional grounds that appeared to invalidate
acts by state and local governments designed to affect conditions
in foreign countries. 
<P>
For its part, Massachusetts, which was supported by amicus briefs
from more than two dozen states and cities and some 78 members of
Congress and dozens of state attorneys-general, argued that states
"should be free ... to apply a moral standard to their spending
decisions ... Nothing in the federal Constitution ... requires the
states to trade with dictators." 
<P>
Monday's 9-0 decision declined to explicitly endorse the more-
sweeping holdings by two lower courts.  
<P>
Instead, the Court ruled more narrowly that a Congressionally
enacted law directed at specific countries, such as Burma, pre-
empts any action taken by local governments vis-à-vis the same
countries. In Burma's case, it found, Congress had passed a law
that gave President Bill Clinton broad discretion to impose or
lift sanctions directed against the country. 
<P>
"Because the state Act's provisions conflict with Congress's
specific delegation to the President of flexible discretion (on
sanctions) ... and with direction to develop a comprehensive,
multilateral strategy under the federal Act, it is pre-empted, and
its application is unconstitutional," the Court said in a 10-page
opinion by Justice David Souter. 
<P>
By failing to rule explicitly on whether all selective-purchasing
laws - including those which target a country that is not the
subject of Congressional sanctions legislation - violate
constitutional provisions on the president's power, the Court
appeared to invite further debate. 
<P>
"Yes, it's a red light when Congress has specifically delegated
power to the president," said Stumberg, who added that where
Congress has not done so, selective-purchasing laws may still be
permitted. "This was not decided by a sweeping constitutional
theory that says states have no role in adopting standards of
public morality in determining purchasing," he said. 
<P>
But the NFTC's Costanias disagreed. "If there isn't a red light,
then it's an awfully pink one," he told IPS. Citing passages in
the opinion which referred to the president's foreign-policy-
making authority as an "exclusively national power," Costanias
added: "It's hard to read that language as allowing any role for
the states and local governments to conduct their own little
versions of foreign policy." 
<P>
Still, Burma activists said they were undaunted.  
<P>
They said they are currently mulling over several possible
responses: using state and local governments to require companies
bidding on public contracts to disclose where they do business;
using public pension funds and investment agencies more to press
shareholder resolutions requiring divestment or other similar
measures; and persuading local and state legislatures to petition
Congress to explicitly provide the legal authority for selective
purchasing laws, as was done in federal anti-apartheid
legislation. 
<P>
"Over the next six months, we plan to introduce new Free-Burma
laws in several key cities and states in New England," said Simon
Billenness, co-ordinator of the New England Burma Roundtable. "Our
message to corporations is clear: If you do business in Burma,
your business will suffer in New England."
