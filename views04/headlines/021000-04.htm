<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SANTA CLARA -      If the Bay Area is the good life, why does everything seem so 
complicated?	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Relax, Boomers. The land of dot-coms, starter mansions, Porsche 
Boxsters and world-class traffic is getting a visit from envoys of 
simplicity.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  As in voluntary simplicity -- the movement that is still gaining 
converts drawn to what supporters call a ``deliberate, contemplative 
way of living.'' It offers the tantalizing hope of finding a balance 
for those trying to keep up with the relentless pace of cutting-edge 
technology.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Hundreds of Silicon Valley toilers will convene Saturday at the 
Santa Clara Convention Center to look for ways to escape consumerism 
and accumulate more quality time. Although voluntary simplicity has 
been around for awhile, this event is billed as the first of its kind 
in Northern California.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``Silicon Valley is so ripe for something like this,'' said Barney 
Burke, one of the organizers. ``There is so much attention being 
given to all the money being made now that I think a lot of people 
are thinking, `Hey, what else is important in my life?' ''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  As most know by now, voluntary simplicity is about discovering 
what is enough in your life and discarding -- or better yet, 
recycling -- the rest. It is not, its adherents insist, about 
poverty, deprivation or living like Mother Teresa, although she is 
not a bad role model.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  The conference will feature a number of authors considered leaders 
in the voluntary simplicity movement, including Vicki Robin, co-
author of the best-selling book ``Your Money or Your Life.'' Some of 
the ideas developed by Robin and the late Joe Dominguez urge 
Americans disillusioned with owning too much ``stuff'' to escape the 
syndrome of constant working and consuming so that they can pursue 
life on their own terms.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``I think it's perennial wisdom,'' said Robin, 54, who lives in 
Seattle and is proud to say she has no ``regular'' job.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``It is about something everyone knows. Living within your means. 
That the best things in life are free. That it is better to give than 
receive. That the privilege of existence is not consumption but 
self-expression and contribution.''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  But adopting simplicity can apparently be complicated enough to 
warrant a big get-together.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``It will be a participatory conference -- an opportunity to talk 
with kindred spirits about things that matter,'' said Stan King, 
another conference organizer. ``It'll be a forum to help you develop 
your personal plan of action about making a difference and living 
with more joy. We'll discuss how we can reclaim our lives, 
relationships, communities 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and the planet.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``Voluntary simplicity is not about not buying things; it is about 
buying things you really need and enjoy and appreciate, like eating a 
piece of delicious fresh fruit,'' said King, 45, who works for MCI 
WorldCom as director of technical support. ``It is a reaction against 
the clutter problem -- look at all the storage lockers proliferating 
like weeds around Silicon Valley.''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Other conference speakers include Cecile Andrews, author of ``The 
Circle of Simplicity,'' Duane Elgin, author of ``Voluntary 
Simplicity,'' and Ernest Callenbach, who wrote ``Living Cheaply With 
Style.''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  None of the speakers will be paid a fee, and all of them will pay 
their own way to Silicon Valley, the organizers said, because paid 
speakers would be somewhat contradictory to the whole spirit of the 
conference. Most of them will be staying at friends' houses or 
apartments.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``Silicon Valley and the Bay Area is a wonderful entrepreneurial 
place to live, very exciting,'' said Burke, 44, who works for the 
city of Mountain View helping -- ironically, he acknowledges -- to 
improve the town's economic development. ``But a lot of people are 
spending an hour and a half to drive to work. If you can't see your 
house in the daytime or see your children grow up, what is the 
point?''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Those with a house full of kids, however, or those who are in jobs 
they need for complicated reasons, may find voluntary simplicity can 
be tough to achieve. Those struggling to make ends meet may well 
think the idea is simply goofy: Give up your car? Move to a smaller 
house? Work part time or even quit the regular job totally and just 
volunteer, as many in the movement suggest?	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Some believe that voluntary simplicity, while noble in its Thoreau-
like goals, is simply out of sync with the times. Boom times.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``This is a movement that gained strength after the stock market 
crash of 1987, but ever since the stock market began skyrocketing in 
1996, it really has just been floating around,'' said Gerald Celente, 
director of the Trends Research Institute.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``The American psychology has again shifted to `shop until you 
drop,' '' he said. ``God bless the organizers of this convention, and 
I wish them luck, but the big emotional drive in America today is to 
climb the ladder of financial success, build trophy houses and drive 
modern-
day stage coaches.''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Yet the simplicity people are quietly confident that the backlash 
is already well along. Simplicity books are selling better than ever, 
some translated into more than a half-dozen languages. A recent free 
conference in Los Angeles was set up for 300; more than a thousand 
people showed up, organizers said. For Saturday's event, where 
tickets are $10 or $5 for self-described ``low-income'' participants, 
fewer than 100 seats remained at press time out of a total of 450.	 
</font></P>
<P> 
</P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``I think people are beginning to feel so overwhelmed that they 
don't have time to enjoy themselves,'' said Andrews, who, besides 
writing a book on voluntary simplicity also writes a column for the 
Seattle Times on the subject. 	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``Vacations or weekends just become times to either catch up or 
escape. It is not really enjoying the moment.''	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  To show neophytes the way, Andrews and others organize what they 
call simplicity circles, small informal meetings in neighborhood 
houses where friends can discuss ways to simplify lives. There is no 
judging or criticizing, she said, just an exchange of ideas while 
immersing oneself in the community.	 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``We need a return to a cafe society where we can all just hang 
out,'' she said. ``Nobody hangs out anymore.''	 
</font>
<P>
<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEETING SIMPLY	 </font></H3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Voluntary Simplicity conference will be held from 8:30 a.m. until 
5:30 p.m. on Saturday at the Santa Clara Convention Center, 5001 
Great America Parkway, Santa Clara. Admission is $10, $5 for 
low-income participants, but seating is limited. More information is 
available at <A HREF="http://contrib.bdhsw.com/events.html">contrib.bdhsw.com/events.html</A>. The conference is 
sponsored by the nonprofits Seeds of Simplicity, the New Road Map 
Foundation, and the Center for a New American Dream, along with 
Hopedance magazine.
