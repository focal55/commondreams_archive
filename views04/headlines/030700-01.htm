<p>A former senior engineer at TRW, 
a top military contractor, has 
charged the company with faking 
tests and evaluations of a key component for the proposed $27 billion antimissile system and then firing her 
when she protested.

<p>      The engineer, Dr. Nira Schwartz, 
was on the company's antimissile 
team in 1995 and 1996 helping design 
computer programs meant to enable 
interceptors to distinguish between 
incoming warheads and decoys. In 
test after test, the interceptors 
failed, she has alleged, but her superiors insisted that the technology 
performed adequately, refused her 
appeals to tell industrial partners 
and federal patrons of its shortcomings, and then fired her.

<p>      Dr. Schwartz has made her 
charges in interviews and in newly 
unsealed documents filed with a federal district court in Los Angeles, 
where nearly four years ago she sued 
TRW. She seeks to  recover for the 
government more than a half-billion 
dollars, some part of which a judge 
could award her as compensation.

<p>      In interviews and court filings, 
TRW has vigorously denied the 
charges. But citing the pending litigation, it has refused to address 
many details of the accusations.

<p>      Right or wrong, the investigations 
surrounding Dr. Schwartz's claims 
are shedding  light on a contentious 
and secretive program. The Clinton 
administration has said it will decide 
this summer whether to proceed 
with an antimissile system meant to 
defend against warheads from so-called rogue states. Russia and other 
countries warn that such a decision 
could undermine a treaty limiting 
antimissile defenses that has served 
as a pillar of arms control.

<p>    In 1998 the Pentagon rejected the 
TRW interceptor as the leading antimissile candidate in favor of a rival 
design by Raytheon. However, it is 
still a backup and could win the lead 
role since the Raytheon design has 
stumbled in recent flights.

<p>   Dr. Schwartz's charges have split 
the Defense Department. Some top 
officials defend TRW as innocent, 
and the Justice Department has so 
far declined to join her lawsuit. But a 
three-year inquiry by the Pentagon's 
Defense Criminal Investigative 
Service, which ended last August 
with no action, cited in its final report "numerous technical discrepancies" that "appear to warrant further review."  

<p>      Moreover, former TRW employees back 
Dr. Schwartz. In an affidavit filed in connection with her suit, Roy Danchick, a retired 
senior engineer at TRW, said he had firsthand knowledge of TRW's "impermissibly 
manipulating" a study of the antimissile 
technology and "censoring the test data" so 
it appeared more successful than it  was.

<p>      Dr. Schwartz's allegations center on 
TRW's certifying to the government that 
interceptors using its computer programs 
would succeed more than 95 percent of the 
time in picking out enemy warheads, even if 
they were hidden in a confusing blur of 
decoys in space. In fact, Dr. Schwartz said in 
court documents, the interceptors could do 
so only 5 to 15 percent of the time.

<p>       Her charges are coming to light now 
because many secret court filings have been 
unsealed at her request and she is seeking 
public support for her case.

<p>    Dr. Schwartz, 53, a naturalized United 
States citizen from Israel,  has a Ph.D. in 
engineering from Tel Aviv University and 
holds 18 United States  patents, including 
ones involving  computerized image analysis 
and pattern recognition.

<p>      TRW hired her to help develop computerized algorithms that are meant to enable an 
interceptor to differentiate between real 
and fake warheads by matching memories 
of threatening images against a rush of 
incoming sensor data.

<p>       Dr. Schwartz  said in an interview that in 
time she had concluded  that all the current 
discrimination technologies were too feeble 
to work and that at some level the Pentagon 
and its contractors were in collusion.

<p>      "It's not a defense of the United States," 
she said,  eyes flashing. "It's a conspiracy to 
allow them to milk the government. They 
are creating for themselves a job for life."

<p> 

<p>      According to court records, Dr. Schwartz 
was hired as a senior engineer by TRW on 
Sept. 5, 1995, joining the company's space 
group in Redondo Beach, Calif. TRW was 
allied with Rockwell (later bought by 
Boeing amid defense consolidations) in a 
competition to build a "kill vehicle," which 
would zoom into space atop rockets and 
smash enemy warheads to pieces.   
<p>  The work 
for which Dr. Schwartz was hired, enabling 
the kill vehicle to spot enemy targets, represented the soul of the machine.

<p>      "She is almost uniquely qualified to 
strengthen the interplay" among TRW specialists pursuing image analysis and object 
recognition, her boss wrote personnel officials after she was hired. 

<p>      Among her jobs was to help assess a kill-vehicle program called the Kalman Feature 
Extractor. From incoming sensor data, the 
extractor was to find critical characteristics of scanned objects, teasing out familiar 
"signatures" that could separate decoys 
from warheads.

<p>      TRW executives believed the extractor 
offered a competitive edge over the rival 
industrial team (then Hughes, later bought 
by Raytheon), and they told the government 
it was a potential breakthrough.

<p>      Familiar with  the extractor from previous research, including that for her patents 
of 1983 and 1989, Dr. Schwartz proceeded to 
test it  against  nearly 200 types of enemy 
decoys and warheads in computer simulations, using secret intelligence data.

<p>      "The moment I analyzed the signatures," 
she said in an interview, "I saw there was a 
problem." Most of the time, she said, the kill 
vehicle's extractor program  failed to distinguish between warheads and decoys because  their identifying signatures differed 
wildly depending on variables like spin, attitude, temperature, wobble, deployment angle and time of day and year.

<p>      "For every RV there was a decoy" that 
produced an identical signature, Dr. 
Schwartz said, referring to a warhead as a 
reentry vehicle, or RV.

<p>      The variations she used in the tests, she 
added, were not arbitrary but spelled out in 
the Pentagon's antimissile bible, the 1993 
"Technical Requirements Document."

<p>      The results were roughly the same, Dr. 
Schwartz said, with the math tool failing 
about 90 percent of the time, when she 
tested TRW's less sophisticated method for 
separating wheat from chaff, known as the 
baseline algorithm.

<p>      In interviews and court documents, Dr. 
Schwartz said she told her boss and colleagues of her discoveries. "They said not to 
worry," she recalled. Flight tests of mock 
objects, she said she was told, would always 
be arranged so discrimination would be 
relatively easy. 

<p>      When she pressed her superiors to tell 
industrial partners and the military of the 
shortcomings, especially of the extractor, 
the purported star of the show, they refused, 
according to court documents. Days later, in 
late February 1996,  she was fired.

<p>      "If you will not notify the U.S. Government," she warned TRW in a furious letter 
after the firing, "then I will."

<p>      Robert D. Hughes, her former boss, expressed no regrets. In company documents, 
he told colleagues that Dr. Schwartz had 
been completely off target, quick with her 
diatribes yet misreading her own tests and 
TRW's process of product development. The 
extractor was not finished but evolving.

<p>      "Stating that there is a 'defect' that we 
should immediately report to the customer 
makes no sense," Mr. Hughes told his boss 
in a March 1, 1996,   letter. "We continually 
improve and verify system performance."

<p>      Mr. Hughes added that the extractor "appears to perform properly under all conditions that have been specified to us" by the 
government and fails only when flight environments are "highly improbable" and "appear not to be within our requirements."

<p> Dr. Schwartz contacted federal investigators, and on April 29, 1996, filed in federal 
district court in Los Angeles a lawsuit under 
the false claims act that sought to recover 
damages for the government. The suit was 
kept under seal. It alleged that TRW had 
"knowingly and falsely certified" discrimination technology that was "incapable of 
performing its intended purpose."

<p>      By June, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service had opened an inquiry out of its 
 field office in Mission Viejo, Calif. The investigative service, an arm of the Pentagon's 
inspector general, is a federal law enforcement agency that can make arrests and 
subpoena documents.

<p>      The lead investigator, Samuel W. Reed 
Jr., interviewed Dr. Schwartz, military experts, TRW officials   and a network of informers. The Justice Department monitored the case. Under the law, it could 
choose to join Dr. Schwartz's lawsuit, which 
would raise her chances of winning.

<p>      Meanwhile, a $100 million test was nearing; it would help determine whether Dr. 
Schwartz's charges were plausible. For the 
first time, a kill vehicle under development 
in the program would be shot into space to 
see if it could discriminate between a warhead and decoys.

<p>        Despite the long work on  the extractor, 
 TRW decided to abandon  it and rely on the 
backup, the baseline algorithm. TRW told 
the military that the extractor was simply 
too big for the kill vehicle's computer, but 
court documents suggest that by then it was 
widely regarded as a failure.

<p>      On June 23, 1997, the mock enemy missile 
-- containing the cone-shaped target warhead, six  balloons and three decoy warheads 
-- was launched from California and sped 
southwest. Twenty minutes later, the interceptor was fired from a Pacific atoll, its 
computer brain ready to try to discern the 
target warhead. The test was to be a simple 
flyby, with no effort at interception.

<p>      The Pentagon hailed the test publicly as 
an outstanding success, but privately,  analysts were dismayed. Even with all the 
coaching, the computer brain of the kill 
vehicle had selected a decoy, Dr. Schwartz 
and other experts said in interviews.

<p>      Undaunted, TRW found good news, as Mr. 
Danchick, the former senior TRW engineer, 
later told Pentagon investigators, when data 
beamed back from the kill vehicle was later 
reworked. In a postflight analysis meant to 
mimic the real thing, TRW managers interrupted the analysis to select a more favorable stream of data for the baseline algorithm to digest, Mr. Danchick told the investigators. Then, finally, the program zeroed 
in on the warhead -- a point hammered 
home in a vivid company graphic.

<p>      This was what Mr. Danchick later called 
in the affidavit TRW's "impermissibly manipulating" test results. Officials at TRW 
and in the government will not say if the 
government back then learned of these acts, 
though the company in a recent statement 
said it "categorically denies that it misrepresented or improperly manipulated any 
flight test data."

<p>      In any event, Mr. Reed, the Pentagon 
investigator, became convinced that the 
matter warranted close scrutiny, as he detailed in more than a dozen reports and 
letters later filed in the court case. He also 
noted  that TRW was the antimissile program's overall system engineer, with responsibilities to "analyze and validate results" of all flight tests, and thus had a 
potential conflict of interest.

<p>      By this time, Mr. Reed's talks with military officials had produced a scientific analysis of Dr. Schwartz's charges. Nichols Research of Huntsville, Ala., a regular adviser 
to the antimissile program, found in December 1997 that TRW's discrimination work 
was "no Nobel Prize winner" but met contract requirements. It added that TRW had 
failed to answer many questions.

<p>      Mr. Reed then asked Pentagon officials 
for a deeper study, which was done in 1998 
and delivered late that year. The five scientists for the study were drawn from a high-level antimissile advisory board with Pentagon  ties dating back to the Reagan "Star 
Wars" era.

<p>      The   new study team  found the baseline 
algorithm "basically sound" but questioned 
some of its purported  strengths. For instance, it showed that small changes in 
planned sensor data greatly lowered the 
odds of selecting the right target. Importantly, it blessed TRW's manipulating some 
data from the first flight test, saying a 
computer program was being developed 
that, if perfected, would do the same in 
space automatically.

<p>      As for the abandoned extractor, TRW's 
onetime star, the new team said dismissively that its "application to discrimination 
may be limited."

<p>      Though equivocal, that study was enough 
for the Justice Department. Three years 
after Dr. Schwartz's initial charge, it  declined to join her false-claims litigation.

<p>      But it hardly ended the story. In a memorandum dated March 15, Mr. Reed asserted 
that the Army had falsely reported to the 
Justice Department that he was against 
federal intervention. "This statement has no 
factual basis," he seethed.

<p>      Mr. Reed formally closed his investigation of TRW on Aug. 31, 1999, citing numerous "irregularities" and "discrepancies." 
Shortly thereafter, colleagues said, he retired from the Pentagon's police force.

<p>         A federal official unconnected to the Pentagon but familiar with the case, who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity, faulted the 
military's two scientific studies of Dr. 
Schwartz's charges as biased. "They don't 
go biting the hand that feeds them," he said 
of the antimissile advisory groups.   
<p>      He added that the studies had enough of the appearance of  impartiality to dissuade the 
Justice Department from entering her case.

<p>   Meanwhile, Dr. Schwartz has added to her 
antimissile criticism. Her investigations 
had shown that the Pentagon planned to use 
up to nine decoys in interception flight tests. 
But when it actually performed the tests 
last October and this January, each flight 
had but one decoy balloon. In an interview, 
she attributed this simplification to the military's belated discovery of fraud and how 
hard the job actually was.

<p>      TRW, though spared a federal assault by 
the Justice Department's decision, fared 
poorly in the investigations. In May 1998, its 
industrial team lost a bid to become the 
antimissile system's "lead system integrator," a post worth $1.6 billion over three 
years. Simultaneously, the company also 
lost its system engineer status. In December 1998, its team lost the competition to 
build the kill vehicle. The prize was won by 
Raytheon, a relative newcomer to the field 
that developed its own discrimination software and is now struggling with problems 
uncovered in recent flight tests.

<p>      Last October, the Pentagon hailed the 
Raytheon test as an unqualified success. 
But it later acknowledged that the kill vehicle had initially drifted off course and 
picked out a decoy balloon rather than the 
warhead.

<p>      In a January test, the interceptor missed 
the target altogether. 

<p> Dr. Schwartz lives with her husband, an 
aerospace engineer, in a two-bedroom town 
house in a gated community in Torrance, 
Calif., and runs computers  for a plastics 
company.   
<p>After representing herself in her 
case against TRW for years, Dr. Schwartz 
recently retained David W. Affeld, a Los 
Angeles lawyer with a bachelor's degree in 
physics. She has filed a wrongful termination action against TRW. And she still, despite the ups and downs, wants the government to join her false-claims suit.

<p>      Keith Englander, director of system engineering for the Pentagon's antimissile program, echoing TRW, said the two studies 
had discredited Dr. Schwartz. Any problems 
with the company's discrimination work, he 
added, were a normal part of the engineering design process.

<p>      He also defended his program against her 
wider criticisms, saying flight tests were 
never rigged and results never doctored.

<p>      The reduction on interception tests from 
numerous decoys to just one, Mr. Englander 
said, was because the government had cut 
the program's goal from trying to knock out 
advanced warheads from countries like 
Russia and China to more primitive ones 
from rogue states.

<p>      "Another objective," he added, "is to 
walk before we run. When you start, you 
don't go to the most stressing environment."

<p>      The Pentagon is sharply divided on such 
issues. Last month in a public report, Philip 
E. Coyle 3rd, the Defense Department's 
director of testing and evaluation, faulted 
the antimissile tests as insufficiently realistic "to support acquisition decisions."
