<p>DETROIT - After the last 
huge recall of Firestone tires in 1978, 
when tread separation problems resulted in hundreds of crashes and 
dozens of deaths, Congress and regulators made a series of proposals to 
tighten federal tire standards. But 
the standards were not revised, and 
many of the same problems, including some that the proposals were 
designed to address, have arisen 
again in the 14.4 million Firestone 
tires being recalled now.

<p> A Congressional report on the 1978 
recall of 14.5 million Firestone 500 
tires pointed out that the steel-belted 
radial tires had easily passed the 
government's tests -- devised in the 
late 1960's for biased-ply tires, an 
earlier technology -- but still failed 
in large numbers on the road.

<p>  Carter administration officials imposed one new requirement on the 
auto industry in 1980 and began 
drafting new tire regulations, government documents from that period 
show.

<p> But all the moves to tighten tire 
regulation were stopped after Ronald Reagan became president and 
sought to reduce the regulatory burden on the then-beleaguered American auto industry. The only new rule, 
involving the disclosure of tires' capacity to carry weight, was rescinded. Also canceled were plans for 
more stringent tests and for mandatory devices to warn motorists when 
their tires became underinflated.

<p>  Some of the regulatory initiatives 
abandoned in 1981 are likely to come 
up again this week, as Congressional 
committees hold hearings into the 
current recall.

<p> The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration has received 
more than 1,400 complaints about 
Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires, the bulk involving tires 
installed on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The complaints and data 
supplied to the agency by Firestone 
attribute 88 deaths to the tires. Firestone has recalled all ATX and ATX 
II tires of the P235/75R15 size, which 
were made from 1990 to 1996, and has 
recalled Wilderness tires of the same 
size made since 1996 at its factory in 
Decatur, Ill.

<p> The safety agency is also reviewing whether many more Firestone 
tires may need to be recalled. On 
Friday, it issued a consumer advisory suggesting that motorists replace 
another 1.4 million tires that Firestone has refused to recall.

<p> Firestone estimates that 6.5 million of the 14.4 million tires covered 
in the current recall are on the road, 
and fewer than half those covered by 
the advisory.

<p> Two provisions dropped in the early 1980's clearly would have made 
the current episode easier for consumers.   
<p>One would have required 
that identification numbers be printed on exterior rather than interior 
sidewalls, making it simpler for consumers to determine if their tires 
were included in a recall or advisory. 
Another, enacted before the 1978 recall, required that independent tire 
dealers keep track of buyers' addresses, so that those customers 
could be contacted during a recall.

<p>  The year before the huge recall of 
1978, Firestone had recalled 400,000 
similar tires made in Decatur. The 
company insisted then, as it does 
now, that the problem was confined 
to that plant, but company documents obtained by regulators in 1978 
showed that Firestone knew of a 
design defect affecting tires from 
other factories as well.

<p> The 1978 recall and the current one 
are the two largest, by a wide margin, since tire regulation began in the 
1960's. The earlier recall produced 
more than 14,000 complaints to regulators, but those complaints cited 
just 41 deaths. Firestone 500s were 
car tires, and few cars rolled over 
when their tires failed. The current 
recall involves far fewer complaints 
but more deaths, most of which have 
occurred when Explorers and other 
sport utility vehicles rolled over after the tires lost treads.

<p> Even before the recall, House and 
Senate conferees were scheduled to 
decide in the next several weeks 
whether to let regulators proceed 
with plans to provide consumers 
with information on vehicles' tendency to roll over. One of the hearings 
this week will be held by Senator 
Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who has led efforts to block 
the release of the information. Senator Shelby, who has been traveling in 
Africa for the past month, has declined interview requests.

<p> Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice 
president for safety and the environment, said in a recent news conference that Ford would favor any new 
tire regulations that improved safety. Ford opposes regulators' plans to 
rate vehicles' tendency to roll over, 
contending that the proposal does not 
measure this tendency accurately 
enough. Regulators have defended 
their plan, pointing out that automakers have opposed attempts to 
measure rollover propensity.

<p> The government tests tires for endurance by running them for 34 
hours at 50 miles per hour, and for 
speed by running them for 90 minutes at 70 to 85 miles per hour.

<p>   Stephen R. Kratzke, the associate 
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
said regulators were considering 
more stringent tests. Any new rules 
would probably not be limited to tires 
for sport utility vehicles and other 
light trucks, he said, but would also 
extend to car tires.

<p>   In response to disclosures that 
Ford subsidiaries overseas began replacing the tires last year, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said 
today on the ABC program "This 
Week" that the Clinton administration also wanted legislation requiring 
manufacturers to report recalls 
abroad.

<p> Firestone officials declined to 
comment on whether they felt new 
tire regulations were needed. But 
Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for 
Goodyear, the market-share leader, 
said tonight that the company did 
"see a need for change in the regulations" and had been working on this 
even before the current recall. Automakers say that they already demand better-quality tires than the 
regulations require. 

<p> Although the cause of the problems in 1978 was never publicly determined, Firestone did make 
changes to its tires, and the problems 
stopped. But the episode crippled the 
company financially and contributed 
to its takeover in 1988 by the Bridgestone Corporation.

<p> Firestone recovered from the 1978 
recall by replacing virtually all the 
tires itself, which kept customers 
coming back to its dealers. But Ford 
has insisted that Firestone reimburse customers who buy other 
brands this time.

<p> Back in 1981, as the Reagan administration began reviewing its 
predecessor's regulatory backlog, 
the American auto industry had laid 
off 500,000 workers and was close to 
bankruptcy. Chrysler had just been 
rescued with government loan guarantees.

<p> While high interest rates and high 
gasoline prices were partly responsible, auto executives also blamed the 
high cost of government regulation, 
and President Reagan sought to ease 
this burden.

<p>  One tire regulation proposed at the 
end of the Carter administration, and 
canceled by President Reagan, 
would have required that vehicles 
alert their owners to low tire pressure, either with a light on the dashboard or with a  red button that would 
pop up from the tire's valve.

<p> Inflation has been a big issue in the 
current recall. Firestone has recommended that Explorer tires be inflated to 30 pounds per square inch, after 
acquiescing for a decade to Ford's 
recommendation of 26 pounds.

<p>  Tom Baughman, Ford's director 
of light truck engineering, has acknowledged that Explorer tires could 
suffer damage if the pressure fell 
below 20 pounds, but said that 26 
pounds provided an adequate margin 
of safety.
