<p>BEIRUT - More than 10,000 angry demonstrators
                        took to the streets on Friday for a third
                        day of protests against perceived US bias
                        toward Israel, with some students and
                        activists laying siege to the offices of
                        the American television network CNN.
<p>
                        Riot police and troops blockaded the
                        streets leading to CNN&#146;s office in
                        Verdun and beat back some 500 furious
                        demonstrators with tear gas, batons and
                        water cannons. The demonstration came a
                        day after a march on the US Embassy in
                        Awkar also ended in violence.
<p>
                        The protest began peacefully in the
                        afternoon, with thousands marching
                        through Basta to assemble in front of UN
                        House in Riad Solh. The General Labor
                        Confederation, Hizbullah, Amal, the
                        Communist Party and the Syrian Social
                        Nationalist Party joined students from
                        many universities for the protest. Even
                        the Nijmeh and Ansar soccer teams
                        participated in the march.
<p>
                        The crowds waved flags and banners
                        blasting America and Israel. Amid
                        traditional chants of &#147;Death to
                        Israel, Death to America&#148; were more
                        studied insults: &#147;You old woman,
                        take back your owl-faced
                        ambassador,&#148; yelled a group of
                        protesters referring to US Secretary of
                        State Madeleine Albright and US
                        Ambassador David Satterfield.
<p>
                        The procession, which extended for about
                        2 kilometers, rippled with banners:
                        &#147;This land is ours,&#148; (in
                        Hebrew), &#147;America and Israel are two
                        faces of the same enemy,&#148;
                        &#147;Albright, we are now
                        All-dark,&#148; &#147;Israel and America,
                        our enemies forever,&#148; &#147;and
                        &#147;Barak is a good terrorist.&#148;
                        The Israeli premier was also portrayed
                        with donkey&#146;s ears and burned in
                        effigy.
<p>
                        Youngsters leaving school joined the
                        march, as did motorists. &#147;We&#146;ve
                        reached the end of our patience,&#148;
                        said one man as he parked his Mercedes.
                        &#147;We can&#146;t take American-Israeli
                        aggression any longer.&#148;
<p>
                        A group of 500 students raced through the
                        streets toward Ras Beirut ahead of ISF
                        troopers&nbsp; toward the CNN offices in
                        the Concorde complex. Police managed to
                        cut them off less than 50 meters away
                        from the building.
<p>
                        CNN has been accused of pro-Israeli bias
                        in its coverage of the recent Israeli air
                        strikes subsequent fighting. Although
                        CNN&#146;s Brent Sadler broadcast live
                        from the Jamhour power station in the
                        aftermath of the air raids, subsequent
                        footage dwelt more on the residents of
                        northern Israel in their bomb shelters
                        and the Israeli government&#146;s
                        perspective&nbsp; rather than the
                        Lebanese view.
<p>
                        The crowd ran straight into the helmeted
                        and masked policemen, who beat them back
                        with batons, tear gas and water cannons.
                        Two students were injured.
<p>
                        An elderly woman, originally from the
                        south, whose house overlooked the scene
                        applauded the students and threw them
                        onions, lemons and shredded bed sheets,
                        antidotes to the tear gas.
<p>
                        The protesters then stood at the
                        crossroads chanting: &#147;We have to
                        tell the truth: We hate you
                        America,&#148; and &#147;Resistance is
                        our right,&#148; while holding up banners
                        parodying CNN that read: &#147;Q and A:
                        Where is the other side of the
                        story?&#148; and &#147;CNN where is your
                        Insight?&#148;
<p>
                        When a CNN cameraman appeared on the roof
                        of the building to film the
                        photographers, the crowd shouted
                        &#147;Zionist Journalism,&#148; and
                        directed obscene finger gestures at him.
<p>
                        Sadler could not be reached for comment
                        on Friday.
<p>
                        The demonstrators then proceeded toward
                        the home of Prime Minister Salim Hoss in
                        Aisha Bakar. Hoss, with a small police
                        escort, came out of his house to meet the
                        excited crowd. &#147;We&#146;re all
                        resistance,&#148; he replied to the
                        cheers of the crowd. &#147;We will not
                        surrender.&#148;
<p>
                        Raghid Adhami, an Arab University student
                        activist, noted that &#147;it&#146;s
                        ironic that there were more policemen
                        guarding the CNN offices than there were
                        guarding the prime minister.
