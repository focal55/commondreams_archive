<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->A state judge in New Orleans has 
removed six teenage boys from a 
juvenile prison after finding they had 
been brutalized by guards, kept in 
solitary confinement for months and 
deprived of shoes, blankets, education and medical care.

<p>  The descriptions of conditions at 
the prison in Jena, in central Louisiana, are stark. But the criticism is 
particularly troubling, federal officials and lawyers for the prisoners 
say, because the prison is run by the 
Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, 
the world's largest for-profit prison 
operator. The judge said the company, which generally has a good reputation in the industry, had treated the 
youths no better than animals.

<p>  The situation raises a fundamental 
question about privately run prisons: Can corporations operate them 
more efficiently than state governments without skimping on essential 
services and proper training?

<p>The teenage inmates were freed or 
transferred to other prisons by 
Judge Mark Doherty of Orleans Parish Juvenile Court, who said that the 
boys had been entrusted to Jena's 
personnel "for the avowed purpose 
of rehabilitation."

<p>  Instead, Judge Doherty said, they 
"wound up in a place that drives and 
treats juveniles as if they walked on 
all fours. These young people deserve to be treated like human beings, not animals." 

<p>      Judge Doherty, a Republican and 
former prosecutor, said  he would devote the next two weeks to hearings 
for 12 other boys he has sentenced 
who are at Jena, to determine whether he can also remove them.

<p>  Justice Department officials and 
others said the problems at Jena 
were at least partly caused by Wackenhut's efforts to cut costs. Consultants for the department and a federal judge found the company had 
stinted on food, clothing, education, 
and medical treatment for 276 inmates, and on training for guards.

<p> The Justice Department sent experts to Jena as a result of an investigation it has mounted in recent years 
into widespread reports of abuses in 
Louisiana's other juvenile prisons. 
Additionally, Judge Frank J. Polozola of Federal District Court in Baton Rouge has overseen conditions in 
jails and prisons throughout the state 
for more than a decade following 
lawsuits on behalf of inmates.   
<p>

<p>  In a statement, Wackenhut said it 
was disappointed by the Justice Department's charges. The criticisms, 
it said, were overstated and ignored 
progress it had made toward resolving problems at the prison. "The 
bottom line is that the juvenile facility at Jena is a well-managed and 
safe facility," Wackenhut said.

<p>   Other private prisons across the 
country have drawn official criticism. But most of those have been 
run by smaller companies set up in 
recent years, as a prison-building 
boom has fostered new industry 
growth.

<p> Wackenhut, based in Palm Beach 
Gardens, Fla., operates 39,308 beds 
in 56 institutions in 13 states and 
seven foreign countries. The reports 
do not make clear whether top company officials knew about the problems at Jena.

<p>   Private prison operators like 
Wackenhut say they can make money by applying better management 
skills than government. On its Web 
site, Wackenhut says it "insists that 
each of its facilities is a model of 
modern correctional management." 

<p>     But a report in February by four 
experts hired by the Justice Department concluded that the problems at 
Jena "seemed to be linked to the 
reluctance of Wackenhut Corrections to spend adequate funds to provide for the care of the youth." 

<p>    And John Whitely, a former warden of the Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola who examined the Jena 
prison for for Judge Polozola, said 
that the pervasive lack of shoes, underwear, blankets and mattresses 
for inmates was "just cheap."  

<p> After reading the reports, Judge 
Doherty went to Jena himself and 
interviewed inmates. He also conducted hearings of his own to determine the facts of cases involving 
youths sentenced in his court.

<p> Judge Doherty said one boy he 
released, a 17-year-old found guilty 
of robbery, had been forced to lie on 
the floor on his stomach with a 
guard's knee in his back, which 
caused excruciating pain since the 
boy had recently had an operation 
for gunshot wounds in his abdomen 
and was wearing a colostomy bag.

<p>      A Justice Department official said 
the government had given Wackenhut and the state Department of Corrections a proposal for improvements at Jena. "We are waiting to 
hear back from them, but the window is short," the official said, indicating that the department was considering a lawsuit against Wackenhut if changes are not made quickly.

<p>    As is often the case in Louisiana, 
the prison is also enmeshed in a 
political corruption scandal.   
<p>A friend 
of former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, 
Cecil Brown, was indicted in New 
Orleans in November on federal 
charges of  funneling $845,000  from 
Fred Hofheinz, a former mayor of 
Houston, to Mr. Edwards for the contract to build the prison at Jena. 

<p>      Mr. Edwards was named as an 
unindicted co-conspirator, said Eddie Jordan Jr., the United States attorney in New Orleans. Mr. Edwards 
is on trial on federal charges of extortion, racketeering and money-laundering in connection with the 
award of a riverboat casino license. 
 Given that case, Mr. Jordan said, it 
would have been superfluous to indict him for the Jena payoffs.

<p>      Though Mr. Hofheinz won the Jena 
contract, he was unable to raise the 
money to build the $12 million prison 
and sold the rights to Wackenhut.

<p>       Before the prison opened 14 
months ago near Jena about 100 
miles northwest of Baton Rouge, 
Wackenhut and state officials said it 
was being built to provide treatment 
for juveniles with drug addictions. 
But the Justice Department experts 
said virtually no drug treatment programs were run at Jena.

<p>      Instead, they found "a dangerous 
place to be," with a quarter of the 
inmates  "traumatically injured" in 
a two-month period, many by untrained guards. Those guards, the 
experts said, routinely threw the inmates against walls, twisted their 
arms or shoved them to the ground 
because they had not been taught 
other ways to control the boys. 

<p>      Dr. Nancy Ray, an author of the 
report, said many boys had no shoes 
or jackets in the winter; some were 
forced to spend the day "huddled 
under a shared sheet or blanket" to 
keep warm, rather than attend classes held in another building.

<p> Inmates often went days without 
clean underwear, she said, and sometimes fought over newly washed 
clothes. Once, she said, inmates 
started a riot by  rushing a food cart 
because of a shortage of food. 

<p> Low pay and poor management at 
Jena, Dr. Ray said, have led to high 
turnover in personnel: five wardens 
since Jena has been open, and 600 
persons have filled its 180 staff positions. Because of Jena's remote location, qualified personnel have been 
difficult to obtain, Dr. Ray said.

<p> She said Wackenhut had skipped 
some elementary procedures like 
background checks on prospective 
employees for criminal records; 
some guards were hired despite having arrest records for assault. 

<p>      In his report, Mr. Whitely found 
some guards who walked off their 
posts, leaving the inmates in control 
of their barracks while the boys frequently slept through what few classes were offered. Even one of the 
wardens told Mr. Whitely that Jena 
was "a comedy of errors." 

<p>      A quarter of the inmates have 
I.Q.'s of less than 70, Dr. Ray said, 
but no special education is provided 
for them. And guards, most of whom 
were white, often used racial epithets 
when talking to the inmates, who 
were predominantly black, the report said.

<p>      A 15-year-old inmate from New 
Orleans also released by Judge Doherty tried to commit suicide 20 
times by swallowing razor blades or 
hanging himself by a sheet, the inmate  said in an interview. David 
Utter, the inmate's lawyer, said Jena's files contained nearly two dozen 
reports that guards had used physical force against the teenager, causing a broken wrist and fingers. 

<p>      The teenager, whose name cannot 
be used because he is a juvenile, said 
he learned about Wackenhut one day 
when he was in the visitors room 
awaiting an appointment with his 
lawyer and read a promotional brochure. "Then I figured out," he said, 
"Wackenhut was using us kids to 
make money."
