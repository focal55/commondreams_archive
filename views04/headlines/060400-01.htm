Fidel Castro has offered to provide free medical training in Cuba for poor American students who could then return home and serve in impoverished areas.
<P>
In a wide&#150;ranging meeting with members of the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus that ended early Sunday morning, the Cuban leader also expressed hope for a weakening of the 38&#150;year old U.S. embargo against his country.
<P>
He voiced support for the work of black Congress members, but said he was disenchanted with elected politics in general and American presidential politics in particular.
<P>
"I really disagree with both candidates for president," Castro said through an interpreter. "I'm going to be among the 50 percent of Americans who will go fishing on Election Day," he joked.
<P>
The offer of the medical training program came after Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who said that parts of his district have an infant mortality rate second in the United States only to Washington D.C. and that the area was medically underserved.
<P>
Castro, who earlier in the meeting described Cuba's program of sending doctors to impoverished areas throughout the Caribbean and Africa, suggested expanding that idea to provide free medical training to 10 to 12 American students.
<P>
Cuba provides such training at the Latin American School of Medicine to premed students from throughout the region.
<P>
"It would be hard for your government to oppose such a program," Castro said. "It would be a trial for them. Morally, how could they refuse?"
<P>
Thompson said he liked the idea and would study it.
<P>
Wearing his trademark olive green uniform, the 73&#150;year&#150;old leader spoke without prepared notes on a wide range of topics during the meeting.
<P>
Castro also said he was hopeful about recent moves in Congress to remove restrictions on American sales of food and medicine to Cuba.
<P>
The Congressional Black Caucus, 36 voting black House members, has long supported lifting the trade sanctions. They have been joined by some Republicans and business groups seeking new markets for their goods.
<P>
Next week, the House is expected to debate an agricultural bill that would license U.S. sales of food and medicine to Cuba as long as they aren't subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.
<P>
"It's interesting that some people on the other side of the aisle are looking at ending the blockade," the gray&#150;bearded leader said. "I find that very significant. I suppose that sometimes some issues wear down. It is a positive."
<P>
Castro expressed gratitude to the black caucus for its stance in support of returning 6&#150;year&#150;old castaway Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
<P>
"We are aware the Congressional Black Caucus has shown great interest in Elian's case. His grandmothers said they were impressed with the attention they were given by the CBC during their visit to the United States," Castro said. "We wish to have more contacts with the Congressional Black Caucus on other issues."
