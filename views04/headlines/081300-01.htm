COPENHAGEN  - A long lost U.S. nuclear bomb
probably lies on the seabed off Greenland near Thule airbase,
which the United States wants to use for its controversial
anti-missile shield, a Danish newspaper reported on Sunday.
<p>Classified documents obtained by a group of former workers
at Thule, an Arctic air and radar base built by the United
States in 1951-52, suggest that one of four hydrogen bombs on a
B-52 bomber that crashed there in 1968 was never found, the
daily Jyllands-Posten said.
<p>``Detective work by a group of former Thule workers
indicates that an unexploded nuclear bomb probably still lies on
the seabed off Thule,'' the right-leaning mass-circulation daily
said.
<p>The crash on January 21, 1968 led to a crisis in relations
between the United States and NATO ally Denmark, which is
responsible for Greenland's foreign, security and defense policy
and at the time prohibited nuclear weapons on its territory,
including Greenland.
<p>Denmark was never informed about the lost bomb, which has
serial number 78252, the paper said.
<p>Footage filmed at the site by a U.S. submarine searching for
remains of the B-52 wreckage in April 1968 contained images of a
bomb-like object, the Danish Ritzau news agency reported.
<p>A U.S. state department document dated August 31, 1968 said
all weapons onboard the crashed aircraft had been accounted for
but did not spell out whether they had been recovered, Ritzau
said.
<p>The United States assured the Danish government in spring
1968 that clean-up work after the B-52 crash had been completed
and gave up searching for the lost bomb in August that year,
Jyllands-Posten said.
<p>``We are not able to comment at this stage,'' Lawrence
Butler, Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. embassy in
Copenhagen, told Reuters by telephone. Danish government
officials were not immediately available for comment.
<p>Senior State Department officials are scheduled to visit
Greenland on August 21 to 24 for talks with Danish and Greenland
officials on Thule's role in the planned National Missile
Defense (NMD) initiative.
<p>According to Senate testimony by Defense Secretary William
Cohen in July, Washington needs a decision on upgrading the
Thule radar next year if the White House makes the political
go-ahead to deploy NMD by 2005.
<p>Home to a ballistic missile early-warning radar station,
Thule sits at the midpoint of a chain of similar sites between
Alaska and the British Isles -- a line along which the United
States may build a shield against missiles from what it calls
states of concern such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya.
<p>Leading politicians in Greenland, which has enjoyed limited
self-determination under the Danish crown since 1979, do not
want Thule to play any role in the NMD.
<p>Denmark has declined to speak out on the issue apart from
saying that the NMD should not go ahead if it breaches the
strategic missile treaty between the United States and Russia.
Moscow opposes the U.S. missile shield plan, and says it does
breach the treaty.
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Denmark and
other U.S. NATO allies that their participation in the NMD could
upset global strategic stability.
