The Israeli-Palestinian conflict could rapidly deteriorate
into a regional war, the United Nations special envoy to
the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, warned yesterday.
<P>He urged Israel to lift its blockade of Palestinian areas.
"The situation as it is now is not tenable," he said. "It
may continue the way it is right now for a few more
weeks ... It could deteriorate sharply, dramatically and
tragically, which may produce regional spillovers, so
we will face a regional war."
<P>Israel imposed the blockade in October, citing security
reasons, but Palestinians say it is a collective
punishment which has put thousands out of work.
<P>Mr Roed-Larsen, a Norwegian, was a key figure in the
secret talks between the PLO and Israel which
produced the Oslo accords in 1993, and is a mediator
whose views are respected by both sides.
<P>"Palestinian living conditions are falling fast, and safety
nets are wearing thin," he said. A "stark increase" in
poverty since the beginning of the intifada had left
almost half the Palestinians living on less than nine
shekels (£1.63) a day, he added. "We need a massive
opening up of the Palestinian territories, and we need it
very quickly."
<P>He said the Palestinians had succeeded in cutting
unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from
30% in 1996 to 12% last year, but it had risen to 40% -
more than 260,000 people - as a result of the
blockade.
<P>"Three years of progress have been wiped out in two
months of conflict."
<P>Because each worker supports several people, Mr
Roed-Larsen estimated that more than 1m
Palestinians had suffered a serious loss of income.
The Palestinian Authority was no longer able to pay
public employees, he added.
<P>He estimated that the Palestinian economy had lost
more than £345m in the first 60 days of the crisis, and
the losses were continuing at £6.8m a day.
<P>The figures do not include the cost of caring for more
than 9,000 wounded Palestinians, nor lost taxes,
which are likely to run into the hundreds of millions of
pounds, nor the damage to infrastructure.
<P>The al-Mazen Centre for Human Rights in Gaza claims
that Israeli heavy weapons partly or totally destroyed
431 houses, 13 public buildings, 10 factories and 14
religious buildings in the first six weeks of the conflict.
<P>The uprooting of trees - which will take years to replace
- will also have a lasting impact on livelihoods. The
Palestinian agriculture ministry estimates that the
Israeli army and settlers have destroyed more than
44,000 trees, mainly grapevines and other agricultural
trees.
<P>The Israelis say such measures are necessary for
security, though they are also a way of pressuring
Palestinians.
<P>Some Israelis want tougher measures, including further
economic isolation. There have also been hints that the
Israel Electric Corporation, which says it is owed
£2.8m by the Palestinian Authority, may cut off power
supplies.
<P>Others, including the Shin Bet intelligence service, say
a tougher line would make people more desperate and
encourage attacks in Israel.
<P>Calling the blockade "completely counter-productive",
Mr Roed-Larsen said yesterday: "This policy is fuelling
anger and is the major instrument for the radicalisation
of the population. The risk here is that one produces
through these policies a new generation of Palestinians
where hatred, anger and resentment will stay for
decades.
<P>"This, in the longer and shorter term, is the greatest
threat to the security situation."
<P>Yesterday, some 30,000 Palestinian mourners
attended a funeral in Gaza City for Awad Selmi, a
senior activist in the armed wing of Hamas who was
killed in an explosion, allegedly while planting a bomb.
Hamas vowed revenge for his death and dismissed
negotiations as an option for peace.
<P>Despite such mass protests, Mr Roed-Larsen believes
it "possible to repair the situation and bring the Oslo
process back by reviving talks."
<P>"The most important steps on the economic front rest
with the Israeli government."
<P>His remarks came after the Israeli group Peace Now

called for the immediate evacuation of the 6,500 Israeli
settlers in Gaza, followed by the gradual, but not
prolonged withdrawal of a further 100,000 settlers from
West Bank areas with a large Palestinian population. It
also proposed a territorial exchange with the
Palestinians of areas in the West Bank with a high
Jewish population, such as Gush Etzion.
<P>The plan, reported yesterday in Ha'aretz, said: "The
evacuation should take place by offering alternative
housing inside Israel, in areas which will be agreed
upon with the settlers."
<P>•Gun battles continued to rage in the West Bank and
Gaza late last night, capping a day in which soldiers
shot dead two Palestinians who took part in
rock-throwing protests.
<P>Meanwhile, in the Jordanian capital, Amman,
unidentified gunmen shot and wounded an Israeli
embassy employee as he left a shop in an upmarket
area of the city last night. The police said he suffered a
gunshot wound to his left foot.
