<p>WASHINGTON - Prodded by the Pentagon, federal authorities are preparing a sea-and-land law 
enforcement operation next week on 
Vieques, a small island off Puerto 
Rico,  to clear demonstrators from a 
Navy bombing range there, government officials said today.

<p> Preparations to move a large 
number of federal special weapons 
and tactics teams to Vieques are 
under way less than a week after 
armed immigration officers stormed 
a house in which the Cuban boy Eli&aacute;n 
Gonz&aacute;lez was staying with his great-uncle in Miami.

<p> As the furor over the Miami operation continues, Attorney General 
Janet Reno has been planning the 
much larger and potentially risky 
operation in Vieques. She has met 
with the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, 
whose agents would play a central 
role in the assault, and with Defense 
Secretary William S. Cohen, the officials said.

<p> The Vieques protesters have been 
demonstrating against an agreement reached on Jan. 31 by President Clinton and  Gov. Pedro J. Rosello<B> </B>of Puerto Rico. The deal allowed the Navy to conduct limited 
exercises on Vieques in exchange for 
an American promise to abide by a 
referendum in Puerto Rico on whether to close the range.

<p> The officials said that most days  
50 to 75 protesters are camped on the 
island in the path of aircraft on 
bombing runs. Their ranks are expected to swell as knowledge of a 
pending  operation spreads. Protesters are expected to arrive by boat 
and congregate at entry gates to the 
base.

<p> Today, a Pentagon spokesman, 
Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said that 
the Pentagon had been consulting 
with other government organizations, but would not discuss the status of the law enforcement operation.

<p>  "We've been in consultation with 
the Puerto Rican government, with 
the Department of Justice, to work 
out a way to clear the range of the 
trespassers," Admiral Quigley said. 
"That process continues, and I am 
just not going to go into any further 
detail on that process at all."

<p> Several civilian federal agencies 
are involved in the law enforcement 
operation, the officials said. Among 
them are the Treasury Department 
and the Transportation Department, 
which has jurisdiction over the Coast 
Guard, which would help block the 
flotillas of demonstrators expected 
to arrive by sea from Puerto Rico.

<p> The officials said that federal authorities are prepared to clear the 
bombing range, but have expressed 
serious reservations about the operation, which is scheduled for next 
week if the White House approves it.

<p>  They said that Pentagon officials 
have been insistent that the Navy 
needed the bombing range for training exercises, even though Justice 
Department officials have said that 
another military-style assault would 
provoke another avalanche of criticism of the Clinton administration.

<p> The officials said they feared that 
neither the F.B.I. nor the federal 
marshals were adequately prepared 
for such a large-scale enforcement 
action so far from the mainland.

<p> The operation would take place 
over a large area in which there 
would be virtually no chance for a 
surprise raid, on beaches and open 
terrain including some areas where 
live munitions are thought to lie.

<p> Moreover, the officials said, they 
feared the law enforcement operation would provoke demonstrations 
in other parts of Puerto Rico, and 
that local authorities were unprepared for large-scale disruptions.

<p> Under the tactical plan, the officials said, marines would arrive 
aboard ships to provide perimeter 
security, but only after the operation, 
and the Puerto Rican police would be 
responsible for crowd control.

<p> When the arrangement between 
the White House and Puerto Rico 
was announced, Mr. Rossello said he 
would help federal efforts to stop 
trespassing at the bombing range, 
but little action has been taken 
against the protesters.

<p> Exercises on Vieques, where the 
Navy maintains a bombing range 
that it  considers essential to the 
training of its Atlantic fleet, were 
suspended last spring after a wayward bomb killed a civilian security 
guard, an accident that  intensified 
longtime protests against the military presence.
 The Pentagon has been putting 
pressure on the Justice Department 
to clear the bombing range of protesters. Earlier this year, an aircraft 
carrier battle group had to conduct 
some training exercises in different 
places, including using a bombing 
range in Scotland. 

<p> The next carrier group, led by the 
George Washington, is headed to sea 
in coming months and the Navy is 
eager to use the range, which officials say offers the ideal location for 
coordinating air-ground-and-sea 
training exercises.
