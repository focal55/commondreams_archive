<p>After 
years of trying to balance its books 
by cutting service, Amtrak has concluded that to succeed it should instead create  routes, offer more frequent service on existing lines and 
organize itself more like the airlines, 
so people can change  trains and get 
to places more efficiently.

<p>     Railroad officials say the railroad 
plans to announce on Tuesday that it 
will run a train from New York to 
California, which it believes is unprecedented. It also plans to expand 
service to Monterrey, Mexico, and 
Toronto, and stretch its Florida-to-New York service  to Boston. It will 
add a third daily train between New 
York and Chicago, in hopes that if it 
gives travelers more schedule 
choices, more people will choose 
trains over cars or planes. And it 
hopes to attract business travelers 
on routes like Washington to Atlanta 
on overnight trains.

<p>      It is a major change of strategy for 
the company, which has  managed to 
sidestep growth since its creation by 
Congress in 1971. 

<p>      "We've been trimming, cutting 
and shrinking up, to save some out-of-pocket cash," said George Warrington, the Amtrak president. "But 
we found out that if you reduce the 
scope of your network, you take out a 
significant percentage of revenue." 

<p>          Governor Thommy G. Thompson 
of Wisconsin, who is chairman of 
Amtrak's board, said in a telephone 
interview, "We're going to grow it 
into profitability."

<p>          Mr. Thompson and Mr. Warrington emphasized, in separate interviews, that part of the strategy was 
to carry more high-value freight. The 
transcontinental train, for example, 
will have refrigerated cars for carrying produce, which the railroad says 
will make it profitable. 

<p> Asked how many people would 
prefer a 58-hour rail trip to a 6-hour 
flight, Mr. Thompson said, "Some 
people will, sure, people that love rail 
passenger service, people who are 
retired and want to see the country 
instead of just flying over it." 

<p>         Cutting trains that did not earn 
back their direct costs and their 
share of overhead costs, Mr. Warrington said, reduced the number of 
passengers fed into the system, some 
of whom would have continued their 
trips on more profitable routes.

<p> Now the railroad wants to add 
trains that can earn back  direct 
costs, and make some contribution, 
even  a small one, to the  overhead.

<p>      "The airlines figured this out a 
long time ago," said Mr. Warrington, 
who plans to imitate the airlines in 
other ways, including offering discounts for tickets sold to leisure travelers weeks in advance, and raising 
the price for last-minute travelers.

<p>      The new schedules, which will be 
in place by 2003, include overhauling 
50 passenger cars and locomotives, 
some of them in storage for years, 
and buying or leasing 2,000 box cars, 
refrigerator cars and "roadrailers," 
which have tires and train wheels.

<p>   Amtrak is negotiating with the 
freight railroads over whose tracks 
it operates, offering them a share of 
the added profits, and hopes to carry 
goods on its passenger trains that 
now move by truck, including  meat 
and poultry and manufactured goods 
like car parts.

<p>      The changes will increase the 
number of miles Amtrak trains travel every year to 38 million from 4 
million and, Amtrak hopes, raise the 
number of passenger-miles  to 6.7 billion from 5.3 billion last year. A passenger mile is one paying passenger 
traveling one mile. 

<p> And the changes will improve the 
bottom line by $65 million a year, 
 company officials say, which is essential because Congress has said it 
will end operating subsidies in 2002.

<p>      The expansion plans require 
agreements with the freight railroads but do not need approval by 
Congress. The changes are big for 
Amtrak but small in the scope of the 
overall transportation picture. The 
railroad is seeking a shift in its share 
of the intercity passenger market, 
which is now less than 1 percent. If it 
gets all the mail and express freight 
business it wants, the total would 
amount to 0.13 percent of that market. For the freight railroads and the 
trucking companies, "that's a rounding error,"  Mr. Warrington said. 

<p>      The Amtrak Reform Council, a 
panel created by Congress in 1997 to 
report on the railroad's progress, 
said recently that from 1989 to  1998, 
while the airlines' passenger miles 
increased by 35.3 percent  and intercity buses' passenger miles increased  by 7.8 percent, Amtrak's 
 shrank by 1.4 percent.
