<p>WASHINGTON - Despite seemingly beneficial new
scientific breakthroughs in the development of biologically
engineered seed, resistance to genetically altered crops is
spreading among farmers, investors and the general public.
<P>
   In a politically diverse panel discussion held here Thursday on
genetically modified organisms (GMOs), farmers, public interest
scientists and environmentalists remained seriously sceptical of
the technology. 
<P>
   Other participants, including government officials,
corporations
and larger research institutions, continued to tout the benefits
of the new technology while downplaying the potential
environmental
and health risks. 
<P>
   Brian Halweil, a staff researcher at the Worldwatch Institute
here, portrayed the biotech companies as "an industry in trouble." 
<P>
   "Stock prices for agricultural biotech companies are falling,
exports of transgenic crops are tumbling, and questions are
mounting about the liability for what is turning into a major
debacle for farmers," he said. 
<P>
   Responding to growing public alarm over the technology and
international efforts to regulate trade in GMOs, share prices for
biotech seed companies - which were Wall Street's rising stars
just
a few years ago - are sinking toward all-time lows. 
<P>
   In May, Europe's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, recommended that
investors sell all holdings in companies involved in GMOs. 
<P>
   Investors in Monsanto Company, the industry leader which has
borne the brunt of public criticism, have watched the
corporation's
share price lose nearly one-third of its value in the last year,
falling from a high of 50 dollars in February 1999 to a recent low
of just 35 dollars per share. 
<P>
   Further complicating the financial picture, said Halweil, are
concerns about uninsured liabilities for farmers and agribusiness
companies. 
<P>
   In November, 30 farm groups, including the National Family Farm
Coalition and the American Corn Growers Association (ACGA), warned
US farmers that "inadequate testing of gene-altered seeds could
make farmers vulnerable to 'massive liability' from damage caused
by...the spreading of biologically modified pollens." 
<P>
   US farmers have been caught in the middle of the biotechnology
debate between seed dealers, chemical companies, grain traders,
consumers abroad, and trade policy, said Gary Goldberg, chief
executive officer of the ACGA, which represents about 14,000
farmers. 
<P>
   The ACGA does not oppose genetically-modified crops and many of
its members plant them. 
<P>
   But as large food companies in Europe, Japan, and Mexico reject
GMOs, US farmers are hurting, said Goldberg. 
<P>
  Because of lost export corn sales, he estimates that last year
farmers lost more than 200 million dollars. 
<P>
   In the United States, Gerber baby foods, Frito-Lay, Seagram's,
IAMS pet foods, and others have also made the decision to purchase
only non-GMOs. 
<P>
   "The question is whether a farmer can afford to plant a crop
this coming spring that may not be marketable in the fall," said
Goldberg. 
<P>
   Acknowledging the controversy, Dan Glickman, the US secretary
of agriculture, recently called for studies assessing the long-
term
ecological effects of these crops. 
<P>
   But Halweil criticised this effort for coming too late, when
already about half the acreage for major commodities like
soybeans,
cotton, corn and canola in the United States, Argentina and Canada
are planted with modified seed. 
<P>
   "Widespread commercialisation of these crops has come before -
not after - thorough examination of the associated risks and
benefits," he said. 
<P>
   Margaret Mellon, director of the sustainable agriculture and
biotechnology programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists here
said she could count on one hand the number of studies examining
the technology's potential risks to human health. 
<P>
   "We have a 'don't look, don't find' regulatory policy," said
Mellon. 
<P>
   She described the health risks, including the development of
possible allergies to GMOs. Scientists do not know the impact of
ingesting food or introducing crops into the environment that are
designed to contain toxic substances to ward off pests, said
Mellon. 
<P>
   Miguel Altieri, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley and an international expert on sustainable agriculture,
described the possible ecological impacts of GMOs. 
<P>
   Massive use of crops altered to contain toxins can dramatically
alter ecological processes and impact non-target organisms,
including beneficial insects and micro-organisms in the soil, he
said. 
<P>
   The transfer of genes through cross-fertilisation could create
super-weeds. And insect pests will quickly develop resistance to
crops modified to contain toxins, since they are constantly
bombarded with the chemical, according to Altieri. 
<P>
   Altered crops on the market are just a continuation of the
"prevailing agricultural model that emphasises chemical-based pest
control" and keep farmers vulnerable to pesticide resistance, he
added. 
<P>
   Concerns over these potential risks recently led countries to
draw up the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety, an international
agreement regulating trade in GMOs. 
<P>
   David Sandalow, US assistant secretary of state for
environmental affairs, said he was pleased with the international
agreement. 
<P>
    While acknowledging the potential risks of GMOs, Sandalow and
a representative for Monsanto discussed the possible ways the
technology could be used as a tool to increase crop yields,
prevent
blights, and even improve nutrition. 
<P>
  For example, last month, researchers at the Institute of Plant
Sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich
announced they had successfully developed a strain of genetically
modified rice capable of eliminating vitamin A deficiency. 
<P>
   This nutritional problem kills up to two million children a
year
and is the world's leading cause of blindness. 
<P>
   "Biotechnology is not going to feed the world," said Robert
Horsch, co-president of Monsanto's sustainable development
programme, contradicting previous advertising slogans of the
company. 
<P>
   "But it is going to be an essential piece of the total
solution," he said. 
<P>
   But despite industry claims, biotech companies have channeled
most of their research to a limited range of products designed for
the capital-intensive farmers of industrialised nations, argued
Halweil of Worldwatch. 
<P>
   Altered seed products, such as Bt corn and Round-up Ready
soybeans, have little relevance to poor, subsistence farmers, who
grow different crops facing other problems, like drought, he said. 
<P>
   "Beyond this obvious disconnect between advertised objectives
and where the money is really going, the search for a biotech fix
for hunger clearly distracts attention from hunger's underlying
causes and other alternative interventions that may prove more
appropriate," said Halweil.
