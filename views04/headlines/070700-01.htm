ST. LOUIS - Al Gore's presidential campaign is brushing aside concerns from the Democratic Party's liberal wing to write a platform affirming centrist stands on trade, education reform, debt reduction and foreign intervention.
<p>
Under the proposed platform to be unveiled here Friday, party officials said, Democrats would affirm the vice president's support of free trade, lifting language from a New York speech declaring that "free and fair trade can help create high-paying jobs for America." That's language that both in content and in tone is deeply opposed by major industrial unions.</p>
<p>
Despite opposition from some teacher organizations, Gore supporters also plan to include in the draft platform a call for federally required teacher certification, for a "rigorous and fair" test for all new teachers, and for "an end to endless delays in removing those teachers who really need to be removed."</p>
<p>
Such positions underscore the Gore campaign's determination to regain the political middle after a primary season in which he moved to the left to beat back a challenge from former senator Bill Bradley. In some ways, the maneuvering by the Gore campaign resembles efforts by Republican George W. Bush to wrest control of his party's platform-writing process from the most ideological elements of the GOP.</p>
<p>
"Much of this [platform] is straight out of what he [Gore] has had to say, what he has already proposed," said North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., chairman of the platform drafting committee. "Being a governor of a centrist state, where you don't win unless you appeal to a lot of Republicans and independents, this is a platform that will be popular and people will respond to it, and I think he can run on it and win."</p>
<p>
During hearings here today by the party's platform-writing committee, one of the few notes of dissent was voiced by Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal advocacy group. Isaacs warned the committee that "liberals in this country are very uneasy" with the party's direction, citing as an example the unwillingness to support cuts in military spending to finance more domestic programs.</p>
<p>
But she declared that there is no chance she will go off the Democratic reservation. In an interview, she said her organization has no serious alternative: "Put it [the Gore campaign] up against what is being offered by the Bush campaign, there is no contest."</p>
<p>
The emerging centrist tenor of the platform is a major legacy of President Clinton's approach to politics. In the 1970s and '80s, Democratic platforms became vehicles for liberal interest groups, which pressed policies on crime, government spending, busing and other controversial matters that made it difficult for the party's presidential candidates to campaign for moderate votes. One of Clinton's major goals has been to end that practice.</p>
<p>
Gore's operatives from the campaign and within the Democratic National Committee have taken firm control of the platform-writing process and are determined to keep the party moving in the same direction. While the exact wording is yet to be determined, officials said the platform would defy key liberal interest groups on several controversial matters beyond trade and education policy.</p>
<p>
The platform, for instance, will follow Gore's stump speech on fiscal responsibility and reject efforts by many advocacy groups to use the growing budget surplus for a major injection of money into existing and new programs. Gore has called for a $500 billion, 10-year tax cut and a new prescription drug program, but he also calls for using other surplus funds on debt reduction.</p>
<p>
Party officials said the platform will offer continued support for the death penalty--but with language added calling for the use of DNA testing whenever appropriate and for the hiring of fully qualified defense lawyers to make sure defendants are adequately represented. Gore has been relatively quiet on this issue despite the national controversy in recent weeks.</p>
<p>
Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), who will become co-chair of the platform committee, acknowledged that there will be differences between the platform writers and some of the ideological groups active in the Democratic Party: "I won't gloss over it, there will be some differences."</p>
<p>
But Gore strategists contend that the major fissures in the party have been generally resolved during Clinton's tenure in the White House.</p>
<p>
"If you think of the last eight years, the party in government worked through all the biggies," a Gore operative said. "It worked through trade; we are a free-trade party. We worked through welfare reform; we are the party that reformed welfare. We worked through fiscal discipline, because we are the party that got rid of this deficit. So a bunch of the cleavages, if you go back to '92, actually have been settled by the process of governing."</p>
<p>
Many Democratic loyalists would disagree with this assessment, particularly organized labor, which unsuccessfully fought the Clinton administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalizing trade relations with China. But labor, which has endorsed Gore, has indicated it is not going to sound a sour note in the platform-writing process.</p>
<p>
The platform writers "will probably follow the vice president's lead. They'll have some statements about worker rights and the environment, but it will also be strongly pro-trade," said Gerald Shea, director of government affairs for the AFL-CIO and a member of the drafting committee. "I guess, if we were of a different frame of mind, we could have a floor fight about it, but we spent a lot of this year battling [the administration]. . . . This is really not the time or place to continue that fight. We don't see this as a forum to settle our differences."</p>
