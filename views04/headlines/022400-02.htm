<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BOGOTA - In his first trip here since the US administration introduced a $1.6 billion plan to bolster the Andean drug war, Barry McCaffrey, the US antidrug coordinator, voiced renewed support yesterday for the Colombian military. The endorsement followed a human rights report that the military is closely linked to rightist paramilitary groups that have committed widespread atrocities.
<P>
<P>While acknowedging ''a huge human rights problem'' in Colombia, McCaffrey said, ''I think the democratic leadership of this country is committed to enforcing the rule of law ... It is clear to me from watching what they do, not what they say, that the armed forces are making an effort to conform to the rule of law.
<P>
<P>''The police and the armed forces now have enormous confidence from the people of Colombia,'' he added. ''Higher than the Catholic church, higher than teachers.''
<P>
<P>McCaffrey was responding to questions raised by a <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0223-02.htm">report</a> released yesterday by the New York-based organization Human Rights Watch, which, with other human rights groups, has accused certain factions within the Colombian military of supporting illegal rightist paramilitary groups in their campaign against leftist guerrillas and their supporters.
<P>
<P>The <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0223-02.htm">new report</a> links three army brigades to paramilitary activity and human-rights abuses. Together with previous accounts, the group has reported ties between the paramilitaries and half of Colombia's 18 army brigades.
<P>
<P>President Andres Pastrana and senior US officials have said they would not tolerate links between the armed forces and the paramilitary groups. Last year, Pastrana forced the resignations of several generals and middle-level officers accused of having ties to the rightwing death squads. 
<P>
<P>But international human rights groups and rights observers say the links are tacitly if not actively  tolerated by high-level officers.
<P>
<P>Among its charges, the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0223-02.htm">Human Rights Watch report</a> said that officers had formed and funded a paramilitary group using active-duty, reserve, and retired officers. 
<P>
<P>The report also alleged that in 1998 and 1999 the army, sometimes with aid from paramilitary groups and hired assassins, had threatened, harassed, and attacked members of groups involved in rights investigations and peace talks. 
<P>
<P>The report was based on evidence gathered by government investigators, as well as interviews with former army personnel, victims, and witnesses. Evidence also included communications between paramilitaries and army officers, the report said.
<P>
<P>''Funding the Colombian military under these conditions will clearly implicate the United States in supporting individuals'' involved in rights violations, said Winifred Tate, of the Washington Office on Latin America, a think tank. ''This report certainly confirms that active collaboration between Colombian paramilitaries and military officers is an ongoing nationwide problem and that the Colombian government has not taken the steps that they have publicly committed themselves to take.''
<P>
<P>Colombia's top generals rejected the findings of the report, saying it was politically motivated and without factual basis.
<P>
<P>McCaffrey said that he had not seen the Human Rights Watch report, but that the problem of rights violations had ''a simple answer: There has to be transparency in government institutions.''
<P>
<P>Although he clarified that the US government wouldn't ''micromanage'' the package once allocated, he said the process would require ''accountability.''
<P>
<P>''The government has to act in accordance with the rule of law, and the government needs to be accountable for its actions,'' he said. ''If there is wrongdoing alleged, it must be investigated.''
<P>
<P>McCaffrey was in Colombia for two days of meetings with government officials, nongovernmental organizations, and the press to lobby for the aid package.
<P>
<P>He has led the administration's push for a military solution to drug production and trafficking in Colombia, which McCaffrey described as ''an emergency problem'' and ''one of the most disgusting, destructive businesses on the face of the earth.'' Colombia is the source of an estimated 85 percent of US cocaine supply and of a growing proportion of its heroin.
<P>
<P>While McCaffrey said his purpose in Colombia was ''to listen, to hear the views'' of top officials, he also used part of yesterday to press the aid plan in interviews with major US broadcast networks.
<P>
