WASHINGTON - The 
Democratic convention starting on 
Monday in Los Angeles will be a 
display of wealth, power and influence as gaudy as the Republican 
show in Philadelphia.

<p> Giving some of the most lavish 
parties will be Hollywood movie moguls, important Democratic sponsors at a time when the Democratic 
National Committee remains heavily 
dependent on its triad  of financial 
support: trial lawyers, trade unions 
and Hollywood.

<p> But the party has aggressively 
courted corporate support in recent 
years   and now counts securities 
firms, real estate investors, telecommunications   giants, software makers and insurance companies among 
its biggest donors. All will be well 
represented in Los Angeles at seven-figure fund-raising events for Democratic candidates and in the skyboxes ringing the Staples Center.

<p> The Democrats have even topped 
the Republican Regents, the elite 
club of $250,000 donors, with a big-dollar cadre of their own, a group of 
18 individuals and corporations 
called Leadership 2000 who have given or raised $350,000 or more. The 
club includes S. Daniel Abraham, 
chairman of Slim-Fast Foods; Peter 
G. Angelos, a trial lawyer and owner 
of the Baltimore Orioles; Peter L. 
Buttenwieser, a liberal Philadelphia 
philanthropist; and Louis Weisbach, 
a former high school football coach 
who is now a multimillionaire marketer of promotional products in 
Niles, Ill.

<p> In the 18 months ending June 30, 
the Democratic National Committee 
had collected $118.6 million in soft-money donations, the unregulated 
gifts from unions, corporations and 
wealthy individuals, nearly erasing 
the traditional Republican advantage in such contributions. The Republican National Committee reported $137 million in soft-money donations over the same period.

<p> The Democrats have raised nearly 
twice as much soft money in the 
current election season as they did at 
this point in 1996, when the party had 
collected $64.1 million. Most of the 
increase, however, is in the party's 
House and Senate campaign accounts, not at the Democratic National Committee, which has raised 
roughly the same amount as in 1996.

<p> While unions are 6 of the party's 10 
top donors, the bulk of the party's 
money is coming from  corporations 
and individuals who are motivated 
both by ideology and an impulse to 
put down a marker on what might be 
a winning ticket.

<p> "Right now the Republicans have 
been more successful with corporate 
money because they're in the lead in 
the presidential race and control the 
House," said Anthony Corrado, a 
campaign finance expert at Colby 
College in Maine. "But I would expect we will see more corporate contributions to the Democrats after the 
convention. When Gore tightens up 
the numbers in the polls and Democrats look like they have a chance to 
take the House, I expect to see corporations hedging their bets."

<p> Each of the three major sources of 
Democratic financing -- lawyers, 
unions and entertainment figures -- 
has increased its giving to the party 
over this point in 1996.   The three 
industries have provided nearly a 
quarter of all soft-money gifts to the 
Democratic National Committee so 
far this election cycle.

<p> The entertainment industry has 
given Democratic Party committees 
$5.8 million this year, compared with 
$5 million in 1996. Labor has contributed $11.3 million so far this year, 
compared with $9.28 million in 1996. 
The biggest increase is in gifts from 
lawyers and lobbyists, who have given the Democrats $11.6 million this 
year, compared with $8 million for 
the 1996 election cycle.

<p> Some of the individual trial lawyers who have donated the biggest 
sums to the Democrats were involved in class-action lawsuits 
against the tobacco industry and received windfall fees. Mr. Angelos, for 
instance, has demanded that the 
state of Maryland pay him more 
than $1.1 billion for his part in negotiating the state's $4.6 billion settlement with cigarette makers. He and 
his law firm have given the Democrats $700,000.

<p> Each constituency of the iron triangle has its reasons to be generous 
to  Democrats.

<p> Hollywood has generally supported the Democrats on social issues 
even as some Hollywood executives 
have expressed skittishness about 
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's condemnation of some movies, television shows and songs, but their jitters have not yet slowed donations. 
In fact, there will be dozens of Democratic fund-raising receptions in Hollywood  next week, including a post-convention party given by the chief 
of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein.

<p> Labor likewise is a longtime stalwart of Democratic politics. And 
while it has had its publicized fights 
with the Clinton administration, notably on trade, it remains ideologically attuned to the Clinton-Gore 
agenda. The administration has supported minimum-wage increases, 
middle-class tax breaks, expanded 
benefits for retirees under Medicare 
and increased spending on child care 
and preschool programs, all policies 
supported by the labor movement.

<p> Organized labor has been highly 
critical of Gov. George W. Bush's 
record in Texas on wages, labor 
rights, immigration, the environment and health care. Teachers 
unions, an important Democratic 
constituency, abhor Mr. Bush's support for school vouchers.

<p> And trial lawyers, put bluntly, despise Mr. Bush, who has made the 
trial bar a favorite whipping boy and 
has moved to limit awards in personal-injury and class-action lawsuits. 
The Clinton administration encouraged plaintiffs' lawyers to pursue 
multibillion-dollar lawsuits against 
cigarette companies which yielded 
huge fees to the lawyers. And Mr. 
Clinton won trial lawyers' undying 
devotion and financial support with 
his 1995 veto of a bill to curb shareholder lawsuits against companies 
with wildly fluctuating stock prices. 
Congress, in a rare act, overrode the 
president's veto, but the trial bar has 
not forgotten the president's act.

<p> Labor is doing more than it ever 
has to support the Democratic ticket, 
according to John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who provided a detailed account of labor's 
plans to help the Democratic ticket 
this fall. Contributions to Democratic 
committees, while significant, are 
but a fraction of the financial and 
shoe-leather efforts that unions are 
planning for the fall, he said.

<p> "The Republicans are going to 
spend more than ever because they 
want that house over there so badly," 
Mr. Sweeney said in an interview in 
his office overlooking Lafayette 
Park and the White House. "We can 
never match them dollar for dollar. 
But we have people power and an 
ability to communicate with people 
one-on-one. They have to try to buy 
that kind of voter contact."

<p> The A.F.L.-C.I.O. expects to spend 
about $48 million in the 2000 campaign, compared with about $35 million in 1996, union officials said. 
Much of the spending in the last 
election cycle was on television advertisements critical of Bob Dole, 
the Republican nominee.

<p> But this year the union is redirecting its efforts away from television 
toward organizing its members to 
get out the vote. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
and its member unions plan to put 
650 full-time workers on the street 
this fall, organizing every local, every factory and workplace, every 
shift to mobilize support and turn out 
union voters,  said Steve Rosenthal, 
the labor federation's political director.

<p> Other unions are planning independent expenditures as well. The 
American Federation of State, County and  Municipal Employees plans to 
spend roughly $3 million on outside 
efforts, including an advertising 
campaign sponsored by a union-created group, American Family 
Voices. The Service Employees International Union will spend as much 
as $5 million, in addition to its hefty 
contributions to Democratic committees and candidates.

<p> "These are the largest contributions that the American labor movement has ever made," said Gerald 
McEntee, president of the 1.3-million-member federation. "Everything is on the table -- the presidency, the leadership in the House and 
now the Senate -- and our members 
understand the stakes."

<p> The Democrats rewarded Mr. 
McEntee and Mr. Sweeney with 
prime-time speaking spots at the 
convention Tuesday and Wednesday 
evenings.

<p> Executives in the entertainment 
industry said that the relatively 
small increase in donations from 
Hollywood this year reflects two factors -- a certain complacency after 
controlling the White House for eight 
years, and a lower level of passion 
for Vice President Al Gore than for 
Mr. Clinton. Mr. Gore's selection of 
Senator Lieberman, an outspoken 
critic of the entertainment industry, 
as his vice-presidential choice has 
also dampened the ardor for the ticket in Tinseltown.

<p> "There's always a different level 
of enthusiasm when you're trying to 
get back something; 1992 was a different dynamic because we were trying to get back the White House after 
12 years," said Donna Bojarsky, a 
political adviser to several major 
Hollywood figures. "Then there's 
Clinton as a phenomenon out here 
that Gore just can't match. He'll 
have the money he needs, but the 
level of enthusiasm is different."

<p> The trial lawyers have been more 
generous in their giving to Democrats and more explicit in the reasons. Governor Bush has harshly 
criticized what he calls the greed of 
the trial bar and tried to limit their 
fees for winning multibillion-dollar 
settlements from the tobacco companies. Mr. Bush's support for tort law 
changes  and limits on settlements 
has made him anathema to plaintiffs' lawyers.

<p> "He has dedicated himself to gutting consumer rights," said Ron Motley, one of the nation's most feared 
trial lawyers and the bane of the 
tobacco industry. "He's for the pharmaceutical industry and the oil industry, and he's going to get a substantial amount of money from the 
tobacco companies."

<p> Senator Lieberman has advocated 
revision of tort law and limits on 
damages that plaintiffs can receive 
in damage suits, a position at variance with Mr. Gore's. Some trial 
lawyers have privately raised concerns about Mr. Lieberman's views, 
but for most plaintiffs' lawyers the 
Democratic ticket remains vastly 
preferable to the Republican alternative.

<p> "As a general rule, his record on 
civil justice issues has not been real 
strong," said Debbie D. Branson, 
chairwoman of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association. But she said Mr. 
Lieberman's presence on the ticket 
would not diminish trial lawyers' 
support for Mr. Gore.

<p> "We know what Gore's commitment is, and we certainly know what 
the Bush agenda is," Ms. Branson 
said. "We're quite confident that a 
Gore administration will support the 
civil justice system and protect 
American families."
