WASHINGTON -- The stakes 
were high on Feb. 2, 1998, when Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals and 
Abbott Laboratories squared off 
here in patent court. For three years, 
the companies had been fighting 
about whether Zenith could market a 
generic version of Hytrin, Abbott's 
$500-million-a-year drug for high 
blood pressure and prostate enlargement. Now a federal appeals judge 
would hear them out.

<p>  "Abbott makes a million dollars a 
day for every day it keeps us off the 
market," Bill Mentlik, Zenith's lawyer, argued in court. Without a 
cheaper generic, he warned, "the 
public is losing."

Trish Vandre, a benefits specialists in Wisconsin, steered Lavera Grosskrueger to a lawyer when they learned Abbot Labs had made deals to keep cheaper versions of Hytrin, a blood pressure treatment, off the market. They are now suing. 

<br>

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>That argument, though, would 
soon give way to more businesslike 
concerns. When the courtroom oratory ended, the two sides headed to 
the elegant Hay-Adams Hotel, a 
block from the White House, for a 
private lunch.

<p>  After small talk about the weather 
and golf, Zenith's lawyers proposed 
an end to the legal wrangles: They 
could become partners in an introduction of a generic drug. Abbott's 
lawyer, Kenneth Greisman, declined, 
court records show. His company, he 
said, preferred "a straight numbers 
deal."

<p> The deal was sealed on March 31, 
1998: Abbott would pay Zenith as 
much as $2 million a month not to 
produce its generic, up to a maximum of $42 million. The next day, 
Abbott agreed to pay another rival, 
Geneva Pharmaceuticals, even 
more: $4.5 million a month, as much 
as $101 million over the life of the 
contract.

<p>  And so it was not until August 1999 
-- when Geneva and Abbott, facing 
an antitrust investigation, scuttled 
their agreement -- that Hytrin's generic equivalent, terazosin, finally 
made its market debut.

<p> That is not what Congress envisioned in 1984 when it passed a law 
intended to keep drug prices down by 
speeding up the entry of generic 
drugs. The Drug Price Competition 
and Patent Term Restoration Act 
was intended to foster competition 
between brand and generic companies, and it has. It was not supposed 
to prompt rivals to join hands in 
keeping drugs off the market.

<p>"The law has been turned on its 
head," said one of its authors, Representative  Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. Referring to Hytrin, he said, "We were trying to 
encourage more generics and 
through different business arrangements, the reverse has happened."

<p> The law was intended to help people like Ewald Grosskrueger, an 80-year-old retired barn builder from 
rural Wisconsin. By the time the 
generic version of Hytrin  became 
available, he had been taking the 
brand-name treatment for more 
than a year.

<p> At $52 a month -- the generic 
version costs $23 -- Hytrin is hardly 
the most expensive prescription 
drug on the market. But it was the 
most expensive in Mr. Grosskrueger's medicine cabinet. He and 
his 81-year-old wife, Lavera, take six prescription drugs between them, and they are 
among nearly one-third of elderly Americans who have no insurance to cover the 
cost.

<p>  The Grosskruegers make ends meet the 
way sturdy, old-fashioned farm couples always have: by growing their own fruits and 
vegetables, burning wood for fuel in the 
winter, clipping grocery coupons. Even after a stroke, Mr. Grosskrueger still mows 
the lawn twice a week. "The medication is 
so very expensive," Mrs. Grosskrueger 
said. "It's a problem, being on a retirement 
income."

<p> The Grosskruegers, now plaintiffs in a 
lawsuit against Abbott, had little idea of the 
company's behind-the-scenes negotiations. 
But the deals Abbott struck are hardly 
unique. Rather, they are part of an increasingly aggressive effort by the industry to 
fend off one of its biggest threats: competition from generics, which in the next five 
years could eat away at tens of billions of 
dollars in sales from brand drugs whose 
patents are about to expire.

<p> To shed light on this trend, The New York 
Times examined hundreds of pages of court 
records and other public documents in 
Washington and various states, and interviewed regulators and drug company executives, with a particular focus on Hytrin. The 
review showed how efforts to extend a profitable drug's monopoly, as much as the 
pursuit of scientific discoveries, drive decisions in one of the world's most lucrative, 
and secretive, industries.

<p> The Hytrin deal has spawned 13 private 
antitrust lawsuits against Abbott, including 
the Grosskruegers' and others filed by 
health maintenance organizations, pharmacies and drug wholesalers. Company officials, citing the suits, declined to be interviewed. But records show Abbott worked 
hard to beat back Hytrin generics.

<p> It filed numerous additional patents on 
the drug's key ingredient, terazosin. It improperly listed a Hytrin patent in the Food 
and Drug Administration's registry, according to a federal appeals court; the move 
would have extended Hytrin's patent life 
had the court not ordered the patent struck 
from the registry. Abbott also filed lawsuits 
against five generic drug manufacturers, 
and countersued a sixth.

<p> No judge ever ruled in Abbott's favor, but 
the maneuvering kept the company's monopoly on Hytrin alive for four years after a 
patent on the key ingredient ran out. During 
that time, Abbott's Hytrin revenues totaled 
roughly $2 billion -- most of it pure profit.

<p> The legal fight to protect Hytrin culminated with the 1998 cash payments. No one 
knows how many similar deals between 
drug makers and their generic rivals exist; 
experts say most are kept confidential. 

<p> But other agreements have recently come 
to light through government investigations 
and private lawsuits; they involve tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug; Cardizem CD, a 
heart medication; K-Dur, a potassium supplement, and Cipro, an antibiotic. And these 
deals, like the Hytrin case, are causing 
consternation among judges and regulators, 
 legislators like Mr. Waxman and Vice President Al Gore, who said in a recent interview 
that such agreements "perpetrate a fraud 
on the American people by denying them the 
benefits of competition."

<p> The Federal Trade Commission is taking 
a hard look; in March, it accused Abbott and 
Geneva (but not Zenith) of violating antitrust laws. The companies defend their 
agreement as proper, but signed a settlement with the F.T.C. agreeing not to make 
any other similar deals. The settlement was 
the first of its kind for the F.T.C.; the agency 
warned that companies might not be treated 
so lightly in the future.

<p> Last month, a federal judge declared the 
Cardizem agreement an illegal restraint of 
trade; in that case, a brand company, 
Hoechst Marion Roussel, paid a generic 
competitor, Andrx Pharmaceuticals, $90 
million not to market a generic alternative. 
The companies have denied wrongdoing.

<p>  The F.D.A. is also stepping in. The agency, 
concerned that deals like the one covering 
Hytrin may be costing the public millions of 
dollars in higher drug prices, is pressing for 
new rules to discourage them -- rules that 
trade groups for both brand and generic 
drug makers oppose.

<p> These regulatory moves come in the middle of one of the election season's most 
closely watched debates: the dispute in Congress about whether to expand Medicare to 
cover prescription drugs. Republicans and 
Democrats are bickering over the size and 
shape of the benefit, which might cost taxpayers more than $200 billion in the next 
decade, but both sides assume generics will 
save money. Yet little attention has been 
paid to how delays in generic competition 
are driving up drug costs.

<p> "Generics have saved the American consumer billions and billions of dollars," said 
Roger L. Williams, who once ran the 
F.D.A.'s office of generic drugs and is now 
chief executive of the U.S. Pharmacopeia, a 
nonprofit standards-setting organization. 
"In an era of soaring costs, and perhaps a 
prescription drug benefit for Medicare, you 
are going to have to have good generics or 
else your system will sink."

<p><b>A Well-Timed Creation</b>


<p> The invention of Hytrin, roughly 20 years 
ago, could not have come at a better time for 
Abbott Laboratories, a company with $13 
billion in sales -- nearly $4 billion coming 
from its prescription drugs division -- that 
is among the most profitable in the nation. 

<p> Abbott has long prided itself on research 
and development, dating to the days of the 
company's founder, Dr. Wallace C. Abbott, 
who tinkered with pill-making in his apartment on Chicago's North Side a century ago. 
But by the early 1980's, when Abbott sought 
F.D.A. approval to sell Hytrin to treat high 
blood pressure, the company was at a tail 
end of a long dry spell.

<p>  "Nothing new had come out of Abbott 
pharmaceutical research in over 20 years, 
until Hytrin came along," said Nelson Levy, 
then the company's director of research and 
development.

<p> Hytrin itself was hardly a breakthrough. 
Dr. Levy said Abbott's chemists "basically 
knocked off" an existing hypertension medicine, changing a few molecules to turn prazosin, a Pfizer drug, into terazosin, a patentable compound that would later take the 
brand name Hytrin. Hytrin did, however, 
have a therapeutic advantage: it was given 
only once a day while prazosin had to be 
taken twice.

<p> In the drug business, such "copycats" are 
not uncommon. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of 
America, the industry trade group,  argues 
that its members spend, on average, $500 
million on research for every new drug -- 
thus justifying their prices. But many of 
today's medicines are, in industry parlance, 
"me-too" drugs. In 1997, according to the 
Boston Consulting Group, which provides 
advice to the industry, 42 of the 100 top-selling medicines were me-too drugs.

<p> Still, the differences between the Abbott 
and Pfizer drugs were significant enough 
for the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office to issue a series of patents on terazosin, the first on May 31, 1977. 

<p> When terazosin was invented, patents 
lasted for 17 years from the date they were 
awarded; under current federal law, the 
term is 20 years from the date the application is filed. Then and now, though, the 
challenge for the drug industry is to maximize the  time its commercial product is 
protected by a patent. 

<p> That would become a problem for Abbott. 
The F.D.A. did not approve Hytrin for high 
blood pressure until 1987, 10 years into the 
life of the original terazosin patent. And it 
was not until 1993 that the agency gave 
Abbott permission to market Hytrin for its 
most lucrative purpose, the treatment of 
enlarged prostate, a condition that affects at 
least half of all men older than 60.

<p> By 1995, Hytrin had become a huge hit; 
the drug generated annual sales of more 
than $500 million, accounting for a fifth of 
Abbott's drug revenue. But a key patent for 
terazosin was due to expire that year, and 
generics were already lining up to compete.

<p> Abbott, though, was prepared. The company had already filed requests for six so-called secondary patents on its compound, 
covering particular crystalline forms of the 
drug, its manufacturing method and a special formula to release the medication in a 
steady, time-delayed dose.

<p> The idea was to lay the groundwork for 
future patent infringement lawsuits against 
generic companies -- suits that could keep 
rivals off the market, or at least delay them. 

<p> In this, Abbott was hardly alone. Most 
drug makers would react the same way, 
said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Chase 
H & Q; some have gone so far as to patent 
the color of the pill, or the shape of the bottle 
the drug comes in.

<p>  "Big drug companies are becoming much 
more aggressive in trying to use secondary 
patents to delay generics," Mr. Zisson said. 
"They're patenting everything they can 
think of, just because the stakes are so 
high."


<p><b> A Bid to Unleash Competition</b>


<p> Just two decades ago, companies like 
Abbott rarely had to worry about generic 
competition. That changed in 1984, when 
Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act.

<p> The legislation, now known as Hatch-Waxman after its sponsors, Senator Orrin G. 
Hatch,  Republican of Utah, and Representative Waxman, was a balancing act. It came 
on the heels of a failed attempt by the 
pharmaceutical industry to persuade Congress to extend the patent life of brand-name drugs.

<p> On the one hand, the law gave the brand 
companies the patent extensions they coveted -- a move that would, in essence, delay 
generic competition. On the other hand, it 
eased the regulatory burden on the generics.

<p> Instead of running costly clinical trials to 
prove their drugs' effectiveness, generic 
companies would now only have to prove 
"bioequivalence,"  that is, that their drugs 
contained the same key ingredients as the 
brand, and worked the same way.

<p> The law also offered the generics a bounty: a 180-day competition-free period -- in 
essence, a six-month monopoly -- for the 
first generic drug maker to seek approval 
for a particular medicine. For a small generic company, that could mean big dollars. 
When Geneva finally began selling terazosin, court records show, it earned as much 
as $11 million a month from the drug, a tidy 
sum for a company whose total sales in 1997 
were about $25 million a month.

<p> At the same time, the law rewarded the 
brand companies by giving them patent 
extensions of up to five years. And there was 
another, little-noticed benefit for the brands 
that would also push back the clock on 
generic competition: once a generic company had requested F.D.A. approval, the brand 
company could sue for patent infringement, 
and the F.D.A. was prohibited from making 
a decision for 30 months while the courts 
weighed the issue.

<p> When the law took effect, the generic 
industry took off, flooding the F.D.A. with 
approval requests: 800 applications in the 
first seven months. Then the lawsuits began.

<p> At the center of some of the earliest 
skirmishes was Albert B. Engelberg, a lawyer and lobbyist who helped write Hatch-Waxman and represented generics manufacturers. In 1988, in one of his first cases, he 
hit the jackpot.

<p> The case involved a popular muscle relaxant, Flexeril, by Merck & Company. Mr. 
Engelberg recalled that a judge ruled in his 
favor, enabling his client,  a division of 
Schein Pharmaceuticals, to sell a generic. 
His fee, a cut of the profits, was $75 million. 
It was an "unexpected bonanza," he said.

<p> The victory changed the legal dynamic 
surrounding Hatch-Waxman, Mr. Engelberg said. Not long after, he said, a brand-name drug company offered to settle a case 
by giving his client cash payments to stay 
off the market, a tactic similar to the one 
Abbott would later try with Hytrin. The 
settlement was kept secret, and Mr. Engelberg would not disclose details. But he said 
the concept caught him by surprise.

<p> "It never occurred to me that you could 
settle a case by paying one of your opponents," he said.

<p>  Hatch-Waxman, he said, was supposed to 
give generic companies an incentive to compete, not to take money in exchange for not 
competing. "It's the evolution," he complained, "of greed versus need."

<p> Now, a decade later, such deals are only 
starting to come to light. In March, protracted delays in marketing a cheaper alternative for tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug 
made by AstraZeneca, prompted sharp criticism from Federal District Judge Ricardo 
M. Urbina for the District of Columbia, who 
said he found the situation absurd.

<p>  "Hatch-Waxman," Judge Urbina wrote, 
"intended to provide an incentive for drug 
companies to explore new drugs, not a market 'windfall' for crafty, albeit industrious 
market players."


<p><b>Expectations of Big Sales</b>


<p> Like Abbott, Geneva was stuck in a dry 
spell when it sought F.D.A. permission to 
market its generic version of terazosin. The 
company, based in Broomfield, Colo., at the 
foot of the Rocky Mountains, had not  introduced a significant new product in years. 
Hytrin, said Charles T. Lay, the company's 
former president and chief executive, 
looked like a good bet.

<p> "It was a $500 million seller," Mr. Lay 
said in a recent interview. "That was certainly attractive."

<p> With 800 employees, Geneva is a relatively small company. But it has a big parent: 
Novartis A.G., the Swiss health and agricultural conglomerate, a company nearly twice 
the size of Abbott. A number of brand-name 
drug makers have entered the generic business, only to abandon it later. Not so Novartis. Mr. Lay said the parent company's 
secret was simple: "They pretty much left 
us alone."

<p> Terazosin would prove an exception to 
that rule.

<p> Geneva set its sights on a Hytrin alternative as early as 1990, court records show. On 
Jan. 12, 1993, the company became the first 
generic maker to file with the F.D.A., angling for the coveted six-month period of 
exclusivity, according to the terms of Hatch-Waxman. Eighteen months later, Zenith 
Goldline Pharmaceuticals filed similar 
plans. Eventually, four other companies 
would do the same.

<p> Abbott responded as the drafters of 
Hatch-Waxman envisioned: it sued. But for 
all its litigiousness, the big drug company 
made a crucial misstep. In filing patent 
infringement claims against Geneva, Abbott's in-house lawyers sought to block only 
a tablet version of Hytrin, neglecting the 
generic maker's plans for a terazosin capsule, the most popular form of Hytrin.

<p> Later, Abbott's outside counsel, Jeffrey I. 
Weinberger, would be called upon to explain 
the omission to Federal District Judge Patricia Seitz in Miami. It was, he said, "a 
botch-up" that the company did not discover 
until two years later, when Geneva received 
F.D.A. approval for terazosin.

<p> The omission was important because it 
meant Geneva would not be tied up in litigation about the capsule when the F.D.A. decided. But it did not leave Geneva completely free of legal liability; Abbott could still 
sue for patent infringement once the generic 
capsules came to market.

<p> By early 1998, according to Mr. Lay, the 
former Geneva president, and F.T.C. documents, Geneva was going ahead with plans 
to make and market a generic Hytrin. On 
Feb. 2 of that year -- the same day lawyers 
for Zenith and Abbott met for lunch at the 
Hay-Adams in Washington -- those plans 
were on the agenda at Geneva's board meeting in Boca Raton, Fla.

<p> Mr. Lay was gung-ho. He wanted to introduce the generic as soon as the F.D.A. 
granted approval. "I was convinced," he 
said, "that we had as strong a case as you 
could want, and that we would not lose in the 
courts."

<p> But the board's new chairman, Jerry Karabelas, the head of the pharmaceutical sector for Novartis, took a different view. Mr. 
Karabelas was new at Novartis; he had 
arrived just six weeks before.   
<p>As an experienced American drug executive, he said, he 
believed that marketing the terazosin capsules was risky. 

<p> With Abbott still suing Geneva over the 
tablet, Mr. Karabelas worried that a loss in 
court could throw its subsidiary, Geneva, 
into a financial tailspin, costing $100 million 
or more -- money that, in the end, Novartis 
might have had to pay. "Nobody," he said, 
"can absorb that kind of loss."

<p> In the end, Mr. Karabelas prevailed. "I 
was overruled," Mr. Lay said.


<p><b>An Alternative to Selling</b>


<p> On March 30, 1998, Geneva got what it 
wanted: F.D.A. approval. While the lawsuits 
about the tablet were continuing, the 30-month waiting period required by Hatch-Waxman had expired, clearing the way for 
the agency to make a decision. Geneva, 
being first in line, was well positioned to go 
to market. But, records show, company officials responded not by shipping the drug, 
but by calling Abbott that same day, to 
inform their counterparts of their intention 
to go to market -- unless they were paid not 
to.

<p> Jeremiah McIntyre, Geneva's general 
counsel, placed the call to Mr. Greisman, a 
senior lawyer for Abbott. Mr. Greisman, 
through an Abbott spokeswoman, declined 
to be interviewed. Mr. McIntyre declined to 
discuss details, except to say what he has 
since said in court:  the demand was a bluff, 
because Geneva was not yet ready to go to 
market, because of technical problems 
manufacturing the drug.

<p> Bluff or not, F.T.C. documents and court 
records, including Mr. Greisman's notes of 
the conversations, show the nitty-gritty calculations that both sides relied on during 
two days of phone discussions between the 
two lawyers and other company executives.

<p> Mr. Greisman was a day away from closing his "straight numbers deal" in which 
Abbott would pay the other generic rival, 
Zenith Goldline, as much as $2 million a 
month not to market its version of terazosin. 
In that deal, Zenith would settle its lawsuit 
with Abbott by agreeing not to contest the 
validity of the Hytrin patent. But the settlement would let Zenith enter the market for 
terazosin if another generic  did.

<p> Knowing that, Mr. Greisman was inclined 
to listen to Geneva's pitch, because Geneva 
held the rights to 180-day exclusivity. Thus, 
Geneva could block other generics, including Zenith, from coming to market simply 
by not introducing  its own product.

<p> And now, for the first time,  Mr. Greisman 
was learning that his and Abbott's negotiating position was even weaker than he had 
thought, because Abbott had neglected to 
sue over the terazosin capsule. It was "a 
total surprise and shock," Abbott's outside 
lawyer, Mr. Weinberger, would later say in 
court, explaining that the company was 
willing to pay because Geneva had such 
powerful negotiating leverage.

<p> For both companies, the negotiations 
hinged on the bottom line: How much would 
Geneva lose if it stayed out of the terazosin 
market, and how much would Abbott lose if 
Geneva entered?

<p> Generic competition would drastically reduce Hytrin's profits. A recent study of 30 
top-selling drugs in the last decade found 
that generic competition would eventually 
reduce their prices by 60 percent to 70 
percent.

<p> That is consistent with Abbott's  internal 
projections about Hytrin; the company forecast losing 70 percent of its market to generics, or $185 million, in just six months.

<p> Geneva, meanwhile, regarded terazosin 
as its own blockbuster, forecasting $84 million in profits before taxes from the drug 
during the first year of sales.

<p> So when the talks began that day, March 
30, 1998, Geneva threw out an opening bid: 
$7 million a month. Too high, Abbott said. It 
had its own projections of Geneva's earnings, suggesting the company would bring in 
no more than $1.5 million a month from 
terasozin, because Geneva would not always 
have the generic market to itself.

<p> Even so, Arthur Higgins, the president of 
Abbott's pharmaceuticals products division, 
was prepared to be generous. When negotiations resumed the next  day, March 31, he 
told Geneva officials that Abbott was willing 
to pay "a premium in the range of $2 million 
to $3 million a month." 

<p> That offer would later raise the eyebrows 
of federal antitrust investigators, who 
viewed the large payments as evidence of 
restraint of trade. "It certainly bore no 
relationship to the money that Geneva could 
have made if they entered the market," the 
F.T.C. chairman, Robert J. Pitofsky, said 
recently.

<p> For the next several hours, the two companies haggled  over the monthly fee. At 
1:45 p.m., Chicago time, they settled on $4.5 
million. "4.5 works!" Mr. Greisman wrote 
in his notes.

<p> The courts were never told; there was no 
need for it, because Geneva, unlike Zenith, 
was not settling its case. Under terms of the 
deal, Abbott would pay Geneva until the 
Supreme Court reached a decision in the 
Hytrin case, or February 2000, when a Hytrin patent was to expire -- whichever came 
sooner. During the life of the contract, Abbott's payments to Geneva would exceed 
$101 million. If Geneva won the suit, its right 
to come to market would be preserved. 

<p> In Switzerland, Mr. Karabelas, the Novartis official who beat back Mr. Lay's efforts 
to go to market, learned of the deal, and sent 
Mr. Lay a congratulatory note.   
<p>Mr. Lay 
himself was apparently satisfied. When the 
deal was signed, according to the F.T.C., he 
proclaimed it "the best of all worlds."

<p> Wall Street was delighted. On April 1, 
1998, Abbott put out a release on both deals, 
announcing "agreements on Hytrin patent 
litigation," but omitting details. The news 
lifted Abbott's stock by about 5 percent, and 
prompted several analysts to issue "buy" 
recommendations for Abbott shares.

<p> "Despite being off patent since 1995, Hytrin ($519 million in 1997 United States 
sales) continues to enjoy market exclusivity 
through successful litigation,"  Hambrecht 
& Quist, the precursor to Chase H & Q, told 
investors in a report written by Mr. Zisson, 
a week after Abbott's announcement. It 
added that "Two settlements last week hold 
the two leading contenders at bay."

<p><b>The Effect of a High Price</b>


<p> The good news for Wall Street was bad 
news on Main Street, where customers without health insurance were paying full 
freight for Hytrin. Among them were Ewald 
and Lavera Grosskrueger. 

<p> For all but one of their 54 married years, 
the Grosskruegers have lived in the same 
house in Loganville, Wis., a picturesque 
town of 228 people and countless big red 
barns, a bank, a gas station, a caf&#0233; and no 
stoplight. The nearest pharmacy is 12 miles 
away in Reedsburg, but until June 1998, the 
Grosskruegers had little need for it. 

<p> A car accident changed that. The Gross
krueger's Buick was hit broadside; Mr. 
Grosskrueger apparently suffered a slight 
heart attack. He spent a week in the hospital, where doctors had trouble keeping his 
blood pressure under control. They prescribed Hytrin; Mr. Grosskrueger was familiar with it, having taken the bright red 
capsules once before to treat an enlarged 
prostate.

<p> Even so,  Mr. Grosskrueger's health began to slide, culminating in a stroke that 
October. Today, husband and wife both require pills to regulate their blood sugar. He 
takes a blood thinner, and medicine for gout. 
Of all the drugs, Hytrin cost the most, 
slightly less than $60 a month at the Reedsburg pharmacy. The price is a bit more than 
some city drug stores charge, which is typical, according to a recent White House report that found that rural Americans often 
pay the most for their prescription drugs.

<p> Neither destitute nor wealthy, the Gross
kruegers are, like many elderly Americans, 
getting by with what they have. Their income is fixed at $1,261 a month in Social 
Security payments and a small pension 
from Mrs. Grosskrueger's 18-year career as 
a cook at the local elementary school. Of 
that, more than a tenth, $148, goes toward 
prescription medicines. It is an expense the 
couple has had trouble absorbing.

<p>   Help arrived in the form of Trish Vandre, 
a benefits specialist for the Sauk County 
Commission on Aging. Like an old-style 
circuit judge, Ms. Vandre travels the little 
towns of Wisconsin's dairy country, working 
as a consumer advocate for the elderly. 
More often than not these days, she said, the 
big problem is prescription drug prices.

<p> In July 1998, when Ms. Vandre was at the 
village hall in Loganville, the Gross
kruegers came out to meet her. She told 
them they might qualify for help from the 
drug makers, which run patient assistance 
programs for people who cannot afford their 
medicine. Typically, companies provide the 
medication for a limited time, with patients 
making a small co-payment to the pharmacist or no co-payment if the drug is sent 
directly to the doctor.

<p>  Abbott runs such a program for Hytrin, 
but the Grosskruegers, with their income of 
slightly more than $15,000 a year, apparently earned too much to qualify. Instead, Abbott enrolled them in a rebate plan that 
offered patients who buy a one-month supply of Hytrin a $10 check and a $10 certificate toward the next purchase.

<p> The arrangement irked Ms. Vandre. "My 
client has to lay out the upfront money, 
which infuriates me," she said. "A $60 medication and a $10 rebate is no great shakes."

<p> The first check came in December 1998. 
By this time, Mr. Grosskrueger had had his 
stroke, and the medicine bills were mounting. His wife appreciated the assistance. 
"Every little bit helps," she said.

<p> It was not until nearly a year later -- 
when Steve Meili, a  lawyer from the nearby 
city of Madision, alerted Ms. Vandre -- that 
the Grosskruegers learned of Abbott's deals 
with its generic rivals. Mr. Meili was considering a lawsuit; Ms. Vandre told the Gross
kruegers to get in touch if they were interested. The usually taciturn Mrs. Gross
krueger summed up their reaction with 
startling bluntness. "We thought we got 
ripped off," she said.

<p> Mr. Meili now represents the Gross
kruegers in their lawsuit against Abbott and 
Geneva. The case, filed in October and seeking certification as a class action, seeks 
damages for patients who bought Hytrin 
when the generic was not available.   
<p>It is 
pending before Judge Seitz in Miami, who is 
also considering other Hytrin-related suits, 
filed mostly by pharmacies and drug wholesalers, some of which have sued Geneva and 
Zenith as well.

<p> The Grosskruegers were not the only ones 
feeling the pinch. As head of drug purchasing for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in 
Oakland, Calif., one of the country's largest 
health maintenance organizations, Dale 
Kramer was counting on a Hytrin generic. 
Kaiser doctors prescribe about 2 percent of 
all prescription drugs in the United States; 
to stock its 300 pharmacies, the H.M.O. buys 
$1.5 billion a year in  medicines. So Mr. 
Kramer keeps  tabs on when patents expire 
and when copycats can hit the market.

<p> By 1997, Mr. Kramer said, it was well 
known among health plan managers that 
Geneva and Zenith Goldline had applied to 
the F.D.A. to sell terazosin. He called officials from both companies, as he often does, 
and said that after those talks, he was 
"pretty well convinced that someone would 
have the product in '98." 

<p> So convinced, in fact, that when he submitted his 1998 budget to state regulators, 
he projected $5 million in annual savings 
from a generic Hytrin. The company, a 
nonprofit corporation, was held to that budget, Mr. Kramer said. In the end, he said, 
such miscalculations inevitably led to higher premiums for patients. Abbott, he complained, took "advantage of the situation" to 
extend its patents "at the expense of individual consumers."

<p><b>The Cost of Doing Business</b>


<p> In August 1999, Abbott lost its monopoly 
on Hytrin's market. Geneva walked away 
from the deal, leaving $45 million on the 
table.

<p> Mr. Lay had already retired from Geneva. But, as he had predicted, the courts 
had ruled in Geneva's favor. In September 
1998, just six months after their deal was 
signed, Geneva beat Abbott in federal district court. In July 1999, an appeals court 
upheld that finding. And there was another 
complication: The F.T.C. was investigating.

<p> With the victories in the lower courts, 
Geneva could no longer justify staying off 
the market. Now that the product was commercially viable, Mr. Karabelas said, the 
company had an obligation "to do the right 
thing." 

<p> Terazosin -- the long-awaited  generic alternative to Hytrin -- hit the marketplace 
on Aug. 13, 1999. That same day, Miles 
White, the chief executive of Abbott, sent a 
note to his subordinates, notifying them of 
the development.

<p> Abbott had made the costly mistake of not 
suing  Geneva, and incurred the losses in 
court, as well as the decision by a panel of 
appeals judges to strike one of its patents 
from the F.D.A. registry. Even so, in Mr. 
White's view, all the company's legal maneuverings  were a smashing success.

<p>  "I'd like to take this opportunity," Mr. 
White wrote, "to recognize the truly outstanding work of our legal team, which 
successfully defended Hytrin's patent protection against challenges for nearly four 
years. This has been one of the most important contributions to Abbott's success in this 
decade."

<p> Mr. Lay, not surprisingly, takes a different view. He is irritated at the brand companies' penchant for filing what he calls "facetious lawsuits," and said the litigation 
drives up the cost of developing a generic 
drug from an average of $500,000  a decade 
ago to more than $5 million today. That, in 
turn, raises the price of generics, he said.

<p> "To the brand companies," Mr. Lay complained, "throwing $10 million or $20 million 
in legal fees at a product is chicken feed, so 
long as they can keep away generic competition."

<p> As for Ewald Grosskrueger, he switched 
to Geneva's generic terazosin last September, a month after it came out. Ms. Vandre, 
the patient benefits specialist, had called 
Abbott asking for another $10 certificate. 
The rebate program for Hytrin, she was 
told, was over.
