UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
denounced
one of the most ''reprehensible'' violations of human rights: the
global trade
in human beings. 
<P>
''I believe the trafficking of persons, particularly women and
children, for
forced and exploitative labour, including for sexual exploitation,
is one of
the most egregious violations of human rights which the United
Nations now
confronts,'' he said in a statement released Wednesday. 
<P>
According to the Geneva-based International Organisation for
Migration (IOM),
human trafficking is a thriving 7-billion-dollar annual global
business with
links to the international arms trade, drugs, prostitution and
child abuse. 
<P>
In the United States alone, an estimated 500,000 women and
children - from
Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe - are trafficked into the
country each
year to work as prostitutes, servants or in sweat shops in the
garment
industry. 
<P>
Addressing a UN conference in Palermo, Italy, Annan said Tuesday
that the
trade
in human beings was both ''widespread and growing''. 
<P>
It is rooted in social and economic conditions in the countries
from which the
victims come, facilitated by practices which discriminate against
women, and
driven by cruel indifference to human suffering on the part of
those who
exploit the services that the victims are forced to provide, he
added. 
<P>
The four-day conference, which is for the signing of a new UN
Convention
Against Transnational Organised Crime, is being attended by
ministers and
delegates from over 120 countries.  
<P>
Urging member states to sign and ratify the Convention, which
includes
provisions against human trafficking and smuggling of migrants,
Annan said the
fate of these most vulnerable people is ''an affront to human
dignity and a
challenge to every state, every people, and every community''. 
<P>
The Convention - the first legally binding UN treaty to fight
organised
crime -
was adopted by the General Assembly last month and will enter into
force after
40 countries have ratified it. 
<P>
For the first time, the convention offers the international
community
universally recognised definitions of several fundamental concepts
of criminal
law linked to organised crime. The 41 articles in the convention
define
concepts such as ''organised criminal group'', ''serious offence''
and
''proceeds of crime''. 
<P>
The new treaty is expected to strengthen governments against all
forms of
serious crimes, including money laundering, arms smuggling,
international
fraud, drug trafficking and corruption. 
<P>
The need for a convention has arisen due to a surge in
transnational crimes
prompted by globalisation. Open borders and advanced technology,
which have
propelled international trade and global commerce, have also led
to an
increase
in cross border crimes. 
<P>
Annan said that criminal groups have wasted no time in embracing
today's
globalised economy and the sophisticated technology that goes with
it. ''But
our efforts to combat them have remained, up to now, very
fragmented, and our
weapons almost obsolete,'' he added. 
<P>
Annan pointed out that the Palermo Convention, however, gives a
new tool to
address the scourge of crime as a global problem.  
<P>
''With enhanced international co-operation, we can have a real
impact on the
ability of international criminals to operate successfully, and
help citizens
everywhere in their struggle for safety and dignity in their homes
and
communities,'' he said. 
<P>
The signing of the Convention, he said, would be a watershed event
in the
reinforcement of the UN fight against organised crime. 
<P>
Addressing delegates, the Italian Minister of Justice Piero
Fassino said: ''We
are no longer citizens of individual countries, but of the world.
Crime is
more
organised at a transnational level while technology has increased
mobility for
all. Both licit and illicit interests have become transnational
and new
figures
of illegality have arisen, as have new forms of crime.'' 
<P>
The Italian government, he said, is supporting a proposal under
which 25
percent of the confiscated proceeds of organised crime will be
paid to the
United Nations to help fight transnational crimes. 
<P>
UN Under-Secretary-General Pino Arlacchi of Italy, executive
director of
the UN
Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, said that until
recently, the
Sicilian city of Palermo was the centre of one of the world's most
notorious
mafias. 
<P>
''Our presence here this week, and adoption of the Convention, is
a potent
symbol of hope. It is a lesson for those who believe that cross-
border
crime is
invincible - too big or too complex to be faced down by the rule
of law,'' he
noted. 
<P>
Arlacchi, who is best known for his relentless battle against
mafia syndicates
in his home country, paid tributes to two judges, Giovanni Falcone
and Paolo
Borsellino, who were killed by the Sicilian mafia back in 1992. 
<P>
''Their deaths remind us that the struggle against organised crime
is never
cost-free. This is the reason why this Convention is a milestone
measure a
living tribute to the thousands of men and women who have lost
their lives in
pursuit of a world free of mafias and criminal violence,'' he
added. 
<P>
''I hope that today will be the beginning of a process - one that
will result
in the reclaiming of many cities around the world - for peace,
justice and the
rule of law.''
