Over the past 500 million years, 
there have been dozens of episodes of 
extinction on the planet, the most 
famous being the titanic event that 
swept away the dinosaurs. Scientists 
have assumed that the time it takes 
for the living world to bounce back is 
proportional to the damage done: 
more time should be required to fill 
all of the earth's empty corners with 
newly evolved life after gargantuan 
extinctions and less time should be 
required after a more minor die-off.

<p>But in an entirely unexpected finding that has gotten the attention of 
both paleontologists and conservationists, researchers reported today 
that it takes a long time to recover 
from these large-scale extinctions -- 
around 10 million years -- and more 
intriguing, the recovery time appears to be the same, whether the 
original destruction was one of the 
grander or one of the more minor 
events.

<p> Many biologists say that by destroying tropical forests and other 
habitats, humans are driving species 
extinct at an accelerating rate that if 
unchecked will result in one of the 
major extinctions in history.

<p>  An ominous implication of the new 
research, some scientists say, is that 
humans may already or will soon 
have destroyed enough species that 
it will require a full 10 million years 
for the planet to recover -- 20 times 
as long as humans have already existed and longer than many scientists predict humanity itself is likely 
to persist into the future. 

<p> Scientists say the new study will 
also prompt paleontologists to rethink how life evolves after major 
extinctions,  events that have played 
a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of life.

<p> The study, by Dr. James W. Kirchner, an earth scientist at the University of California, and Dr. Anne Weil, 
a paleobiologist at Duke University, 
appears today in the journal Nature.

<p> "I think it's a surprise to everyone," said Dr. Douglas Erwin, a paleobiologist at the National Museum 
of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. "We're 
just at the beginning of understanding biotic recoveries following extinctions."

<p> Dr. Mike Foote, a paleobiologist at 
the University of Chicago, said the 
paper would change how people 
looked at the fossil record, adding, 
"It's going to be seminal." 

<p> Borrowing statistical techniques 
from other areas of geology and astrophysics, the researchers examined an enormous set of data gathered by the late Dr. Jack Sepkoski, a 
paleontologist at the University of 
Chicago. The data set documents 
when new kinds of marine animals 
first appear in the fossil record and 
when they disappear or go extinct. 

<p> Scientists expected that with every 
additional species that gets knocked 
out during an extinction, the longer 
the recovery should take. 

<p> What researchers found instead 
was that after extinctions, big and 
small, it took about 10 million years 
for the proliferation of new kinds of 
organisms to peak and then begin to 
tail off. The decrease in the proliferation of new creatures is seen as a 
sign that ecosystems have recovered 
and are so full of diverse life that 
there is little opportunity left for new 
organisms. 

<p> So unexpected was the outcome 
that Dr. Weil said that when Dr. 
Kirchner handed her the results, she 
said, "Did you do that right?" She 
added, "I made him do the analysis 
again while I was looking over his 
shoulder."

<p> Scientists said the new study suggested that the evolutionary rebuilding after an extinction might work 
differently than had been envisioned. 

<p> Many paleontologists had previously pictured extinctions as being 
the equivalent of wiping the pieces 
off a chessboard. In such a situation, 
though the pieces are gone, the 
spaces on the chessboard, the place 
for a queen or rook -- or in nature, 
the niche for an algae-eating fish or a 
long-lived evergreen tree -- are still 
there, each simply needing to be refilled by a newly evolved species.   
<p>

<p> But the new study, Dr. Erwin said, 
suggests instead that "when you 
wipe the pieces off the chessboard, 
the size of the chessboard shrinks." 
That is, with the loss of a species 
comes the loss of opportunities for 
the existence of other organisms as 
well -- like those that would make 
their living by preying upon or parasitizing that organism.

<p>  So when there are few types of 
organisms left after an extinction, 
there are few opportunities for new 
species to evolve. Each new kind of 
organism that does evolve creates 
more opportunities for other species, 
and each of those, in turn, creates 
more opportunities in a kind of  positive feedback loop, the dynamics of 
which may be setting the recovery 
clock at 10 million years.

<p> While some scientists predict that 
humanity will not live to see a recovery from the extinctions it has 
wrought, many questions remain. It 
is difficult to compare modern-day 
extinctions with those viewed 
through the lens of the fossil record.

<p>  As a result, scientists still do not 
agree on whether and when humanity will have destroyed enough species to require a 10 million year 
recovery, with some saying that 
point has already been reached, and 
others predicting it will be anywhere 
from 50 years to a thousand years or 
more in coming. 

<p> But if diversity is what provides 
the fuel for the recovery from any 
extinction, as the new work suggests, 
then in terms of a practical application, Dr. E. O. Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, 
said the message was clear.   
<p>"The 
bottom line," Dr. Wilson said, "is 
that we had better take care to hold 
on to the biodiversity that still exists."
