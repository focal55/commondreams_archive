COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 22 -- 
Ralph Nader was on a tear, railing 
against chief executives' salaries, 
the corporate-dominated campaign 
finance system and cuts in factory 
inspections. Several of the steelworkers seated around him were nodding, 
and then nodding again, in silent approval. 

<p>  For a few minutes at least on 
Friday, it seemed as if the steelworkers' cynicism about politics and politicians had evaporated, and they 
were receiving the truth, or at least a 
truth they rarely hear.

Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, spoke to members of the United Steelworkers of America Saturday in a classroom at Ohio State University in Columbus.

</TABLE>
</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>"You're the guys who work hard," 
said Mr. Nader, the Green Party 
candidate for president. "You're the 
guys who pay the taxes. You're the 
guys who fight the wars, and then 
they say, 'Tough. We're closing the 
factory. It's globalization.' And then 
they use factories overseas where 
dictators repress the wages to compete against you."

<p> Mr. Nader -- whose words, though 
not his speaking style, are laced with 
emotion -- then laid into Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats, 
saying they have done little for labor 
because they have been able to take 
labor's support for granted.

<p> "When you're taken for granted, 
you're taken," he said. "When organized labor can say to these candidates, 'You're not going to take us for 
granted anymore, we have an alternative and the alternative is Nader 
and the Green Party,' then they'll 
start calling."

<p>  Afterward, the 20 steelworkers 
who had gathered in a small Ohio 
State University classroom to hear 
Mr. Nader gave him rave reviews, 
and many of them vowed to vote for 
him this November. Mr. Nader was 
in Columbus for rallies with Green 
Party members, environmentalists 
and steelworkers.

<p>  "I'd say Nader is the best of anyone," said David Cole, an electrician 
at AK Steel's mill in Mansfield, Ohio. 
"I really like him. I haven't seen 
much from anyone else."

<p> His friend and co-worker Larry 
Pugh was just as enthusiastic. "I 
think he has the right answers," said 
Mr. Pugh, a crane operator at the 
plant, where management locked out 
620 workers last September. "He 
gives us a choice because the Democrats and Republicans have sold us 
down the river." 

<p>  This outpouring of enthusiasm for 
Mr. Nader worries many Democrats, who fear that so many steelworkers, auto workers, teamsters 
and other union members will vote 
for him this fall that Mr. Gore could 
lose in Ohio and other Midwestern 
swing states. For the Democrats, an 
added concern is that two of the most 
powerful unions in the Midwest, the 
Teamsters and the United Auto 
Workers, have flirted with Mr. Nader 
and have not endorsed Mr. Gore, 
even though the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is backing the vice president.

<p>  Many steelworkers are still angry 
at Mr. Gore because he backed the 
agreement to normalize trade relations with China, which many union 
members fear will accelerate the 
exodus of American factories to China. Although Mr. Nader is best 
known for his crusading on consumer protection and the environment, 
he has grown closer to labor unions 
in recent years, fighting with them 
against the China trade deal, the 
World Trade Organization and the 
North American Free Trade Agreement.

<p>  All the steelworkers here hailed 
Mr. Nader, but several said they 
would still vote for Mr. Gore because  
they feared Gov. George W. Bush 
would win if Mr. Nader drained too 
many votes from the vice president. 

<p>  "I'd like to thank you for championing our issues," Skip Hall, another 
a steelworker who drove in from 
Mansfield, told Mr. Nader. "You're 
terrifying the Democrats. You know 
this is going to be a very close election. In 1980, I was dissatisfied with 
Jimmy Carter. I backed Ted Kennedy, and we ended up with Ronald 
Reagan. He gave us a bad Supreme 
Court. We're still living with that 
today. That's the dilemma we face 
today. The same thing could happen 
with you."

<p>  The excitement generated by Mr. 
Nader also concerns some labor 
leaders. John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has repeatedly 
urged union members to back Mr. 
Gore, saying it is important to prevent Mr. Bush from winning because 
working with a Republican Congress, 
he might push through legislation to 
weaken unions and job safety laws.

<p>  George Becker, president of the 
United Steelworkers of America, 
was one of labor's most vociferous 
critics of the China deal, but he says 
it is time to line up behind Mr. Gore. 
He said in an interview that labor's 
support for Mr. Nader was modest 
and would grow smaller, and he predicted that many union members 
leaning toward Mr. Nader would ultimately vote for Mr. Gore upon realizing that Mr. Nader cannot win.

<p>  "There are two viable candidates, 
Al Gore and George W. Bush, and 
we're picking the one closest to the 
viewpoints of our members and the 
issues of working people," Mr. 
Becker said. "Nader's a fine man. He 
takes a lot of positions that are near 
and dear to us. But he is not a viable 
candidate. In that regard, anybody 
who would support Ralph Nader we 
think would lessen Al Gore's chances 
of winning."

<p>  David Leland, chairman of the 
Ohio Democratic Party, said that the 
race between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush 
was close in his state, but that he did 
not think Mr. Nader would hurt the 
vice president. Recent polls show Mr. 
Nader getting 4 percent of the vote in 
Ohio, compared with more than 10 
percent in California, but Mr. Leland 
said those were high-water marks 
that were bound to fall.

<p> "Most people know a vote for 
Ralph Nader is a wasted vote at best 
and a vote for George Bush at 
worst," he said.

<p>  Mr. Becker said he hoped Mr. Gore 
would become more outspoken on 
workers' issues to excite union members about his candidacy. Indeed, on 
Monday, Mr. Gore is scheduled to 
hold a town hall meeting in Cleveland with 75 steelworkers from Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Indiana and Illinois. 

<p> The Nader campaign sees this as a 
move to keep union members from 
drifting toward their candidate.

<p>  Mr. Nader said a central purpose 
of his candidacy was to move the 
Democratic Party left on labor and 
other issues. To make it easier for 
unions to organize, Mr. Nader called 
for making it legal for a union to 
boycott not just the company it is 
striking against but other companies 
that do business with it. (Such boycotts were banned by the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.) He also called for 
requiring employers to pay triple 
damages when they illegally fire 
workers for supporting a union. 

<p>  Asserting that he should be included in any presidential debates, Mr. 
Nader said he would seek to force 
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush to address 
work-related issues, like occupational safety, that have been largely ignored during the campaign.

<p>  "Gore will tell you, 'I'm for you. 
I'm going to fight for you. I'm for a 
ban on using replacement workers in 
strikes,' " Mr. Nader said. "But what 
has he done in eight years? I don't 
care what you're for. I want to know 
what you've done. Talk is cheap."
