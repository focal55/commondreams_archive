<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department on
Tuesday was expected to release its new proposals to regulate
the booming organic food industry, easing concerns among organic
farmers and sellers, and potentially defusing some trade
conflicts with Europe.
<p>In late 1997, the U.S. Agriculture Department first proposed
national guidelines for labeling and marketing organic food and
clothing but was deluged with a record 300,000 comments -- most
of them negative.
<p>Environmentalists, farmers, consumers, the entire Vermont
Legislature and celebrities, including musician Willie Nelson,
wrote, mostly in opposition to the regulations as drafted.
<p>Critics objected to putting the ``organic'' label on foods
grown from genetically modified seeds, treated by
disease-killing irradiation and fertilized by sewage sludge
recycled by municipal waste plants.
<p>Agriculture Department officials spent the last two years
reviewing the letters and have rewritten guidelines to finally
govern what exactly can be labeled as ``organic.''
<p>Department officials have said this time around,
biotechnology, sewage sludge and irradiation will not be
considered organic.
<p>``I do believe that USDA really has tried to incorporate
what they received as comments,'' Katherine DiMatteo, head of
the Organic Trade Association, said earlier this year as details
of the government proposals emerged.
<p>In addition to trying to satisfy the industry and the
growing number of American consumers who shop for organic foods,
the rules are also seen as a way to potentially defuse some
trade conflicts with Europe.
<p>When European governments banned some of the same
controversial farming practices that would be banned by the
proposed organic rules, the U.S. government objected, calling
them unfair to trade, and imposed retaliatory trade sanctions.
<p><font size=+1><b>Organic Industry Booming</b></font>
<p>The U.S. organic industry sold more than $4 billion worth of
products, from food to clothing, in 1998. It is estimated that
organic sales grew by more than 20 percent in 1999 and will
increase by another 20 percent this year.
<p>But the industry said it needed standards to maintain the
surge in organic sales. Currently, organic standards vary among
state and private sector certifiers. For example, an orange
labeled ``organic'' in one state may be raised completely
differently than an ``organic'' orange from another state.
<p>The industry has said that without guidelines, there is
nothing to back up the claim that a product is organic, raising
questions among consumers about whether an organic label really
means anything -- and whether it is worth paying more for food
designated as such.
<p>But some farmers expressed concern that the new guidelines
will impose a costly system on organic producers, many of whom
are small farmers who sell close to home.
<p>``I am concerned that the charges connected with this new
system will be so high that small farmers won't be able to
afford it,'' said Elizabeth Henderson, an organic vegetable
farmer in Wayne County, New York.
<p>Organic industry representatives say that this time they are
confident their voices have been heard, largely after the
Agriculture Department hired someone who had been critical of
the initial USDA proposal to head up the task of rewriting the
government organic standards.
<p>Kathleen Merrigan was hired by the USDA in June from the
Henry Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture. After the
initial rules came out, Merrigan wrote a 100-page, single-spaced
response to the USDA on behalf of the Institute, most of it
pointing out flaws in the agency's proposals.
<p>And, when Congress passed a bill a decade ago that ordered
the Agriculture Department to create rules for organic food and
clothing that would be enforced nationwide, Merrigan was working
for Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, who was head of the
Senate Agriculture Committee. Merrigan drafted the legislation
for the organic rules.
<p>Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, who led the
legislation's passage in the House said on Monday he was happy
the USDA had finally completed its second draft.
<p>``I'm pleased to see that the USDA is finally working on a
better deal for the consumers,'' he said.
