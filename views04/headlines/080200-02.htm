LOS POZOS, Colombia<wbr> - <wbr>Using U.S.-donated helicopters to reinforce Colombian police during
guerrilla attacks will escalate this country's prolonged civil conflict
and draw America closer to direct involvement in the fighting, a rebel
spokesman warned Tuesday.
<p>Raul Reyes, spokesman for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, this country's oldest and largest guerrilla force, said
helicopters used to rescue police during attacks will be considered
"military targets," subject to being shot down.
<p>He made the remarks in this rebel-controlled hamlet a day after State
Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said in Washington that the Clinton
administration will not "second-guess" the way Colombian police decide to
use Black Hawk helicopters donated by the United States for the fight
against illegal drugs.
<p>Reeker's statement added fuel to the debate over the U.S. role in
Colombia, a country where a 36-year conflict has been exacerbated in the
past decade by drug money that has left both the rebels and the
right-wing private armies that pursue them better armed than the
military.
<p>The helicopters, piloted by Colombian police, have generally been used
to protect planes that fumigate crops of opium poppies and coca, the raw
material used to make cocaine. Colombia supplies about three-fourths of
the world's cocaine and an increasing share of the heroin sold in the
United States.
<p>After recent guerrilla attacks on police outposts, U.S. congressional
members who support the Colombian police have criticized the Clinton
administration for allegedly preventing use of the helicopters for
reinforcement or rescue operations. When police officers were killed late
last month in a remote area after guerrillas pinned them down and they
ran out of ammunition, the U.S. Embassy released a statement denying that
the ambassador had prohibited the Colombians from sending the helicopters
in for support.
<p>Weather conditions were blamed for grounding the aircraft both then
and over the weekend, when a guerrilla incursion left the northern town
of Arboleda in ruins. Only four of more than two dozen police assigned to
the town are known to have survived the attack, which was carried out
with weapons that included gas cylinders hurled like Molotov cocktails.
<p>On Monday, Reeker said the Black Hawks could be used in such
situations.
<p>"What they are trying to do is intimidate us," said Reyes, the rebel
spokesman. "But all that intimidation and threats will achieve is a more
forceful reply of the Colombians in defense of our national sovereignty.
<p>"This is direct intervention of the United States in the internal
affairs of Colombia," he said.
<p>The helicopters used by police have been donated over the past two
years and are not part of the $1.3-billion anti-narcotics aid package
approved by the U.S. Congress in late June. Reyes called the package "an
attack against the Colombian peace process," whose negotiations are now
entering their 18th month.
<p>Only two of the helicopters to be supplied as part of the new aid
bundle are destined for the police. The rest will go to the army to
support recently formed anti-narcotics battalions.
<p>Both the $289 million in anti-narcotics aid given to Colombia last
year and the new package are restricted to being used in the fight
against drug production and trafficking. However, the line between the
drug war and the guerrilla war in Colombia is often blurred because
rebels collect "taxes" on drug crops grown in areas under their control.
<p>Further, U.S. congressional supporters of the Colombian police have
long urged crossing that line.
<p>The most vocal of those, Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), said during
a conference in Washington last year, "The administration has been so
preoccupied with avoiding being involved in Colombia's counterinsurgency
efforts that it has permitted the situation to erode and deteriorate."
<p>However, Reyes disputed the notion that the United States has been
extra-careful about avoiding counter-guerrilla activities.
<p>"Ever since the Black Hawks arrived, they have been used against us,"
he said. "What [the U.S. is] doing now is publicly recognizing that they
can be used."
<p>Both civilian pilots flying fumigation planes under contract and
helicopter pilots protecting them have reported being fired on by rebels
over the past two years. Guerrillas have said that they fired on the
aircraft to protect civilians from fumigation chemicals.
