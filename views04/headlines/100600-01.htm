UNITED NATIONS, Oct 5  - The widespread belief among Third
World nations
is that the five permanent members of the Security Council - the
United
States,
Britain, France, China and Russia - are not the only ones wielding
veto powers
at the United Nations. 
<P>
Lurking behind the United States is a sixth UN member state, which
for the
last
50 years, has indirectly - and meticulously - exercised its own
brand of veto
through a proxy. 
<P>
''Whenever the US vetoes a Security Council resolution critical of
Israel,''
says one Arab diplomat, ''we always see the hidden hand of the
Israelis.''

</TABLE></font>That hidden hand may be visible once again as the United States is
poised to
cast its veto against a UN draft resolution sponsored by the 114-
member
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) calling for an international inquiry
into the
killings of over 45 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza since
last week. 
<P>
The resolution, which is expected to be taken up later this week,
faces a
possible US veto because Israel has made it clear it will not
permit any
international investigation into the shootings. 
<P>
The proposed investigation is also one of the demands made by
Palestinian
leader Yassir Arafat Wednesday at the Paris talks involving
Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
<P>
Arafat has also demanded an immediate cease-fire and the
withdrawal of all
Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza. 
<P>
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke of the United States has argued that
the first
priority must be to stop the violence. ''Now was not the time to
apportion
blame,'' he told the Council. 
<P>
''Too often in the past, positions taken by this Council, and by
the UN
itself,
had tarnished the Organisation's credibility and undermined its
ability to
play
a constructive role in the peace process,'' he said. 
<P>
The US argument is also that any attempts to probe the killings
will undermine
the ongoing peace process in the Middle East. 
<P>
A Third World diplomat told IPS that he could not understand why
the United
States should oppose such a probe when it has supported several
such
investigations, including visits by members of the Security
Council, into some
of the trouble spots in Africa, including the Democratic Republic
of the Congo
and Sierra Leone. 
<P>
If, however, the resolution is vetoed by the United States, there
is a strong
likelihood that NAM will call for a special session of the UN
Human Rights
Commission (HRC) in Geneva to probe the use of deadly force by the
Israelis.
Two similar special sessions were held earlier in Geneva to
investigate human
rights violations in East Timor and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Security Council Wednesday, the UN
Permanent
Observer for Palestine Nasser al-Kidwa said the way in which
Israel had
reacted
to the Palestinian protest was no surprise. 
<P>
''They had used large amounts of military power, snipers, live
ammunition,
hand
grenades, anti-tank missiles and helicopter gun-ships, moving
battle tanks to
Palestinian towns,'' he said. 
<P>
The Israeli army, he charged, tried to inflict great losses on the
Palestinians, using unprecedented military force. Their actions
were in gross
violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the protection of
civilians in
times
of war. 
<P>
''The perpetrators must be brought to trial and punished,'' he
added.  
<P>
He also asked the Security Council to put an end to ''the brutal
campaign of
Israel and its violation of international law, Council resolutions
and the
peace accords''. 
<P>
Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France said the events of recent
days were
the
result of ''a deliberate provocation'' carried out by rightist
leader Ariel
Sharon. 
<P>
France, he said, condemned his actions and deplored the violence
that grew out
of his visit to the area of the Al Aksa Mosque on the Temple
Mount. That
visit,
he said, was done for reasons of domestic politics. 
<P>
Ambassador Hasmy Agam of Malaysia, who is the primary sponsor of
the NAM
resolution, said the world would never forget the image of the 12-
year-old
child being shot and killed in the arms of his father. 
<P>
Their fates summed up the plight of the Palestinians living in the
occupied
Arab territories: that of vulnerable people who were, from time to
time,
caught
haplessly in situations of violence and subjected to the draconian
policies
and
practices of the army of an occupying power. 
<P>
Malaysia also reaffirms the establishment of an independent state
of
Palestine,
with Al-Quds Al-Sharif, as its capital, along with the
implementation of all
international resolutions on the Palestinian issue, he added.
These were the
only guarantees for lasting peace between Israel and Palestine, he
noted.
