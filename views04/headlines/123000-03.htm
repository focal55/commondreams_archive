WASHINGTON  -- They call him ''traitor,'' ''egomaniac'' and
''fool.'' Some of Ralph Nader's old battle buddies even call him
''politician.''
<p>
   Many of those who fought with Nader on the frontlines for the
environment, consumer rights and other liberal causes now say he
betrayed them by not ending his presidential run in time to save Al
Gore's candidacy. And they say his career as a public advocate is
through.
<p>
   ''Who's going to work with him now?'' snorted Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., a powerful congressman who once worked with Nader on labor
and regulatory issues.
<p>
   The iconoclast's idol is undergoing the kind of beating he once
trademarked, but Nader could care less.
<p>
   ''They were all anesthetized by Clinton, the snake charmer,''
said the man who described Gore and Bush as ''Tweedledum and
Tweedledee.''
<p>
   In an interview in his cramped campaign office -- just blocks
from his cramped Washington bachelor's pad -- Nader sounded the same
themes that informed his campaign: the two major parties are
beholden to corporate interests, and voters lacked choice.
<p>
   ''The Democrats were moving toward the Republican Party,
developing Republican agendas for Republican issues -- to take
Republican voters away,'' he said.
<p>
   That elicits moans from his former allies, who agree with him
that much was wrong with the Democratic Party -- but who say
differences are real, and now very very evident, thanks to the man
they still affectionately call ''Ralph.''
<p>
   Each starts by mentioning Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, whose
controversial civil rights record is already dogging his attorney
general nomination. They also point to Andrew Card, a former
automobile industry lobbyist named as White House chief of staff,
and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney's oil industry past.
<p>
   ''We all complained how Clinton gave a green light to industry,
but it can be greener,'' said Ken Cook, who heads the Environmental
Working Group.
<p>
   Nader now concedes that Bush will cause more damage than Gore.
<p>
   ''Bush is probably going to jettison the tobacco lawsuits, and
he's not good on energy,'' he said.
<p>
   That's a major departure from his insistence that Gore and Bush
were two sides of the same coin. Having made the concession, Nader
-- who avoids eye-contact like an oncoming Ford Pinto -- started
scribbling notes to himself, and said a Bush presidency will at
least galvanize liberals.
<p>
   ''Oh yeah,'' Conyers said scornfully. ''Now that we're not
anesthetized, Ralph, we want to work real close and take
instructions from you.''
<p>
   Not all in the advocacy community blame Nader.
<p>
   Maggie Geist of the Association for the Preservation of Cape Cod
blames Gore for straying from his strong pro-environment record in
a misguided attempt to win the center.
<p>
   ''He will have to explain to himself why he chose not to
highlight that during his campaign,'' she said.
<p>
   Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen, a consumer group, and
once a close Nader ally, is also wary of a Bush presidency -- but
she blames Gore's poor performance.
<p>
   ''You have to ask why he didn't win by a landslide, why he
wouldn't let Clinton campaign in Arkansas,'' she said.
<p>
   Nader's detractors readily agree that Gore misstepped -- but they
say that pales next to Nader's willfulness.
<p>
   ''Nader was never the only factor (in Gore's defeat),'' said
Cook. ''But it was the only factor that was a betrayal.''
<p>
   Nader had his strongest support in a handful of states -- Oregon,
Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan. Gore ultimately won all
five, but only after being forced to spend precious time and money
there. Meanwhile, Nader only took 2 percent in Florida -- a state
that was never considered a Nader stronghold -- but that was enough
to throw the state to Bush.
<p>
   Some say Nader strayed from his original aim of establishing the
Green Party as a national force, and let his personal dislike for
Gore color his judgment.
<p>
   Gary Sellers, a retired activist whose friendship with Nader
dates back to the 1960s -- Nader was the best man at his wedding --
says Nader hinted last summer that he would withdraw if it were
getting close.
<p>
   ''He said, 'Oh, Gary, don't worry about it,'' Sellers said.
<p>
   When it became clear in October that Nader had no such
intention, Sellers established Nader's Raiders for Gore. He now
describes Nader as an ''egomaniac'' seduced by one more stab at the
national spotlight, and says he lied to his constituents about
Gore's record -- just like the establishment politicians he once
reviled.
<p>
   ''You don't throw the country away'' to prove a point, Sellers
said, noting that Bush could appoint as many as 600 federal judges.
<p>
   Peter Petkas, a Houston businessman and a Nader's Raider in the
1970s, said the same single-mindedness that drove Nader to heroic
victories in those days undid the election.
<p>
   ''Ralph didn't see a way out, he locked himself in,'' he said.
Petkas says he suffers the consequences of the ex-Texas governor's
deregulatory fervor on a daily basis -- Houston is the nation's
smoggiest city.
<p>
   Nader says pulling out would have betrayed the Greens. ''The
campaign built the basis for a long-range political reform
movement.''
<p>
   Notably, he does not use the word ''party'' -- the Greens fell
well short of getting the 5 percent needed to qualify for federal
matching funds, and they elected just 20 people to local office,
including a sewage commissioner.
<p>
   For some, those numbers spell the last of Nader. Norm Shiren, a
retiree in Chappaqua, N.Y., modeled his modest local environmental
activism on Nader's. No longer.
<p>
   ''Nader ended up throwing the election to someone who is going
to do everything to ruin his issues,'' he said.
