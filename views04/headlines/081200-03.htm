The energy services company that 
Dick Cheney served for much of the 
last five years as chairman and chief 
executive has agreed to let  Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential 
candidate,  retire  with a  package 
worth an estimated $20 million, according to people who have reviewed 
the deal.

<p> The board of the Halliburton Company, which is based in  Dallas, approved the arrangements on July 20, 
five days before Gov. George W. 
Bush announced his selection of Mr. 
Cheney as his running mate.   
<p>

<p> The board's vote allowed Mr. Cheney to avoid a potentially costly aspect of his employment contract, 
which said he would forfeit some of 
his compensation if he retired before 
age 62 without the board's permission. This provision, known as golden 
handcuffs, is routinely included in 
executives' contracts to give them 
incentives to stay.

<p> Mr. Cheney, who spent much of his 
life as a public official and federal 
employee, became a wealthy man in 
his years with Halliburton. He has 
been paid at least $12.5 million by 
Halliburton since he joined the company in 1995 and has received stock 
and options worth nearly $39 million 
at its current share price.

<p>  By permitting Mr. Cheney, who is 
59, to treat his departure as early 
retirement, the directors allowed 
him to keep $10 million worth of 
stock and options he would have forfeited had he simply resigned, the 
company's public filings show. It was 
not clear whether the $10 million was 
part of the retirement package or in 
addition to it.

<p>  One of those briefed on the  plan 
said that the board was told the 
package totaled about $20 million.

<p>   While not extraordinarily large by 
current corporate standards, Mr. 
Cheney's retirement package solidifies and expands his personal stake 
in the oil industry in general, and 
Halliburton in particular, while he is 
on the campaign trail confronting 
energy policy issues that will affect 
Halliburton's  performance. 

<p> Dirk Vande Beek, Mr. Cheney's 
campaign spokesman, and a spokeswoman for Halliburton both refused 
yesterday to confirm any details 
about the retirement arrangement. 
Mr. Vande Beek said details  were 
 being worked out. Mr. Cheney, he 
said, will remain an employee of 
Halliburton until Aug. 16 with the 
title  "chairman in transition."

<p> The price of Halliburton stock is 
substantially higher than it was 
when Mr. Cheney took over but his 
tenure  was not an unqualified success. The Halliburton board annually 
sets financial goals for the company 
with the understanding that executive bonuses will be withheld if the 
targets are not met. The company 
failed to meet those targets in both 
1998 and 1999, although the board 
decided to pay Mr. Cheney and other 
executives bonuses anyway in 1998 
because they had engineered a major merger with Dresser Industries, 
another oil services company. That 
bonus came to $1.15 million for Mr. 
Cheney, nearly as much as his $1.18 
million salary for the year. In 1999, 
however, the bonus was withheld. 

<p>  Mr. Cheney has said in interviews 
that he will sell off his Halliburton 
stock if the Republican ticket prevails in the fall. It is not yet clear how 
Mr. Cheney might handle his stock 
options, a major part of his wealth, 
which if retained would give him a 
stake in the company's performance 
for years to come.

<p> The options give him the right to 
buy shares at a set price for up to 10 
years. Some of Mr. Cheney's options, 
however, cannot be exercised before 
January, unless the board waives 
restrictions on them. Other options 
give Mr. Cheney the chance to buy 
Halliburton stock at more than its 
current market price of $51 a share, 
worthless today but potentially valuable if he can hold them until the 
company's stock rises.

<p> A spokesman for the company, 
Wendy Hall, declined to discuss Mr. 
Cheney's retirement. Ms. Hall said 
that the company allowed some executives to retire with full benefits 
after age 55 and that details of Mr. 
Cheney's arrangement would be 
made public next week. 

<p> According to one board member, 
the package approved for Mr. Cheney was not discounted to reflect 
either his age or his short tenure. 

<p> "Whatever the contract calls for" 
is what was approved for Mr. Cheney, said W. R. Howell, a Halliburton 
director and  former chairman and 
chief executive of the J. C. Penney 
Company. "He's entitled to full retirement."

<p> Mr. Howell added, "There was 
nothing done at the board level of an 
exceptional nature for Dick Cheney. 
The press release indicated that 
Dick Cheney is retiring and that's 
what he's doing."

<p> According to reports filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Cheney is covered by two 
retirement plans at Halliburton, a 
profit-sharing plan and a second 
plan, intended  to provide a minimum 
pension if the profit-sharing funds 
are inadequate. The company has 
not disclosed how much Mr. Cheney 
stands to receive from those plans.

<p>   Halliburton's financial statements 
do not describe its early retirement 
program, but such  arrangements 
typically involve a substantial reduction in the pension benefits the employee  receives.

<p> In recent years, a number of corporate boards have granted departing chief executives pension benefits 
for which they did not qualify under 
strict terms of their contracts.   
<p>

<p> Mr. Cheney joined the company's 
board on Aug. 10, 1995, and became 
chief executive on Oct. 1, 1995. While 
details of the retirement plans affecting Mr. Cheney are not clear 
from the company's public filings, 
many such plans require an employee to have at least five years of 
service to receive any benefits, a 
milestone Mr. Cheney did not pass 
until Aug. 10 at the earliest, assuming his board service is counted.

<p>       Under his leadership, the company 
has won two important international 
contracts, one with Petr&#0243;leos Brasileiros, or Petrobr&#0225;s,  the Brazilian oil 
giant, the other a Defense Department contract for the reconstruction 
of war-damaged Kosovo.

<p>  Also on Mr. Cheney's watch, to 
save money, Halliburton laid off 
thousands of employees and reduced 
retirees' medical benefits.

<p>       Mr. Cheney's decision not to sell 
his stock until after the election drew 
some criticism. 

<p> "It is a built-in conflict of interest 
throughout the campaign," said 
Chuck Lewis of the Center for Public 
Integrity in Washington.

<p> Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the 
Bush campaign, rejected that view. 
"America is best served when good 
people from the private sector are 
willing to return to the public sector," Mr. Fleischer said.

<p>  "There are many good people like 

<p>former Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin who have done so," he added. 
"Surely we want to encourage their 
return."

<p>          The Halliburton board was well 
within its legal powers in granting 
Mr. Cheney full retirement benefits 
before the date in his contract, said 
John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law 
professor at Columbia Law School.

<p>  "The purpose of such golden handcuffs is to keep an attractive executive from taking a competitive job in 
business," Professor Coffee said, 
adding, "I don't think you need to 
extend that concept to keep someone 
from becoming pope, vice president 
or chief justice."

<p> The decision is certainly a significant one for Mr. Cheney's own financial security, since his tenure at Halliburton came after he had spent 
most of his career in government 
service as a congressman from Wyoming and as secretary of defense  -- 
without amassing significant wealth.

<p>  Now, however, he is wealthy. He 
exercised options on 100,000 shares 
and sold the stock at the end of May, 
earning a profit of $3 million. The 
other options and restricted stock he 
was given are worth $35.7 million at 
current prices. 

<p>    History offers few examples of 
how other candidates in Mr. Cheney's circumstances handled the effect of a campaign on their personal 
financial interests.

<p>   Most candidates on a presidential 
ticket, even those with  business experience,  entered the race from state 
or local political office, said Judge 
Leslie H. Southwick,  author of the 
book  "Presidential Also-Rans and 
Running Mates, 1788-1980." It is far 
less common for a full-time corporate manager to step directly from 
the executive suite onto the campaign trail, where campaign issues 
can affect his personal fortune.

<p>      There have been exceptions, of 
course. For example, Wendell Willkie was president of Commonwealth 
and Southern, a large utility holding 
company, when he made his bid for 
the presidency as a Republican in 
1940 at a time when utilities were 
vehemently opposing New Deal 
projects like  the Tennessee Valley 
Authority, Judge Southwick noted.

<p>   In 1992, H. Ross Perot sought the 
presidency on the Reform Party 
ticket while overseeing Perot Systems, a computer systems company. 
But the company was not publicly 
traded then.

<p>  Jimmy Carter, who had already 
served as governor of Georgia, campaigned for the White House in 1976 
while helping  run his family's struggling peanut business.
