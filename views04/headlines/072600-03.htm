Leading consumer and environmental groups are fuming because the 

Clinton administration has appointed a former Monsanto Corp. lobbyist 

to represent U.S. consumers on a transatlantic committee set up to 

avoid a trade war over genetically engineered foods.	 


<P>  U.S. farmers have planted millions of acres of corn and other 

crops that have been genetically engineered to resist pests, and the 

growers want to export such produce freely. But in Europe, where 

genetically altered crops have been dubbed Frankenfoods, governments 

have imposed labeling rules and safety tests that have restricted 

U.S. imports.	 

</P>
<P> Friction between the United States and Europe over the foods issue 

torpedoed last year's World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle 

and now threaten to erupt into a transatlantic trade war.	 

</P>
<P>  In a last-ditch effort to settle their differences, U.S. and 

European leaders agreed in May to create a 20-person Biotechnology 

Consultative Forum, representing pro and con interests on both sides 

of the Atlantic.	 

</P>
<P>   In a letter appointing the U.S. members of this advisory forum, 

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked them to suggest a 

compromise on labeling, safety testing and other regulatory issues, 

and to present it to the next U.S.-

European economic summit in December.	 

</P>
<P> To build support for this compromise effort, the State Department 

asked environmental and consumer opponents of bioengineered foods to 

nominate their representatives to the biotech powwow.	 

</P>
<P>  But this gesture backfired when the State Department ignored the 

nomination of consumer representative Michael Hansen -- a scientist 

with Consumers Union -- and instead gave the post to Carol Tucker 

Foreman, a Capitol insider who recently took over food issues for the 

Consumer Federation of America after 18 years as a lobbyist.	 

</P>
<P>  What angered critics most is that during her lobbying days, 

Foreman helped Monsanto -- the firm most closely identified with 

genetically engineered foods -- win approval for bovine growth 

hormone, a chemical that stimulates milk production.	 

</P>
<P>  ``We think it's a big mistake to appoint a person to represent 

consumers who's been so closely tied to the biotech industry,'' said 

Dan Seligman, the Sierra Club's representative on trade issues. 	 

</P>
<P>   A U.S. government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, said 

the State Department is aware of the flap created by Foreman's 

appointment but believes the committee -- which includes Norman 

Borlaug, the father of the ``green revolution'' -- represents ``a 

broad range of civil society.''	 

</P>
<P>  Foreman, 62, was on vacation, and associates at the Consumer 

Federation of America said she could not be reached for comment.	 

</P>
<P> But federation Executive Director Stephen Brobeck called it 

``absurd'' to suggest that Foreman, who has worked on Capitol Hill 

for 40 years, would be beholden to 

Monsanto because she did some ``modest consulting'' for the company 

five years ago.	 

</P>
<P>  ``I would challenge anyone to identify any statement or action 

since she's returned to CFA that did not serve the public interest,'' 

Brobeck said. ``People in this town move between the private, public 

and nonprofit sector all the time.''	 

</P>
<P>  Foreman's career exemplifies Capitol Hill's revolving door.	 

</P>
<P>  An Arkansas native, Foreman came to Washington in 1961 as a Senate 

staffer, became executive director of the Consumer Federation of 

America in the early 1970s and was appointed an assistant secretary 

in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Carter 

administration.	 

</P>
<P>  In her government role, Foreman earned praise and criticism from 

consumer colleagues. Foreman helped persuade Congress to eliminate a 

co-payment requirement that had kept millions of people from getting 

food stamps. But she also relaxed poultry inspection rules that 

favored big chicken farmers like Arkansas' Tyson Foods.	 

</P>
<P> But what really irked critics is what Foreman did after she left 

USDA in 1981 to form her own lobbying firm. In addition to helping 

Monsanto get USDA approval for bovine growth hormone, she also 

lobbied for Olestra, Procter & Gamble's fat substitute, and consulted 

with tobacco giant Philip Morris.	 

</P>
<P> Critics concede that Foreman's corporate involvements never damaged 

her Democratic Party credentials and marvel at how her Arkansas roots 

</P>
<P>--her brother is Jim Guy Tucker, the former Arkansas governor and 

Whitewater figure -- enhanced her access in the Clinton 

administration.	 

</P>
<P>  ``It didn't surprise me at all when the White House nominated her 

to this international committee,'' said John Stauber, co-founder of 

the Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison, Wis., nonprofit that 

tracks lobbyists.	 

</P>
<P> ``She's trusted and tight with the Democratic Party, she isn't 

threatening to industry and she has managed to retain consumer 

credentials,'' Stauber said. ``Who better to try to smooth over these 

differences (between Europe and the United States) and make the world 

safe for the export of genetically engineered foods?''	 

</P>
<P> A source close to the transatlantic commission said Foreman was 

chosen because she is a pragmatic dealmaker who is more interested in 

compromise than confrontation.	 

</P>
<P>  Some of Foreman's critics also seem to prefer that the 

transatlantic compromise effort fail. Lori Wallach, a trade 

specialist with Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group in 

Washington, D.C., said if U.S.-European differences over genetically 

engineered foods spark a trade war, it could topple the entire WTO 

framework which, in her view, favors corporate profits over worker 

and consumer interests.	 

</P>
<P>   Meanwhile, those who want the commission to achieve a compromise 

are running out of time. The first meeting of the transatlantic forum 

probably won't occur until September because many of the European 

members are on vacation.	 

</P>
<P>  ``My hope for the forum is to bring the United States around to 

regulatory approval and labeling policies that are more consistent 

with the European policies,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with 

Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group. Goldburg was 

appointed by the State Department to fill the environmental slot on 

the transatlantic committee.	 

</P>
<P>  ``But we have an incredibly broad charge and a limited amount of 

time,'' she said.
