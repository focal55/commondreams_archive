ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA  - Japan and Norway moved a
step closer on Wednesday to lifting a 1986 ban on commercial
whaling, after many of their foes on the issue agreed to press
ahead with drafting new whaling rules.
<p>``It's another step forward toward the resumption of
commercial whaling,'' Campaign Whale spokesman Andy Ottaway
said.
<p>However, Japan faced a fresh wave of criticism after it
confirmed it planned to add two new whale species to its
research hunting program, raising the heckles of
conservationists and those who fear that the whale population is
dwindling too quickly.
<p>``We are appalled at the proposal,'' said UK Fisheries
Minister Elliot Morley after 19 member nations supported his
resolution to the 41-member International Whaling Commission
(IWC) to condemn Japan, with 12 against and two abstaining.
<p>``We feel very strongly about this,'' he said, saying the
U.K would pursue the issue at bilateral and multilateral
meetings.
<p>Japan caught more than 500 minke whales in 1999 for what it
says were scientific purposes and plans to add 50 Bryde's whales
and 10 sperm whales to its new research hunting program.
<p>It and Norway, which plans to kill 655 minkes this year, are
pushing also for a resumption of commercial whaling.
<p>Most members the IWC agreed to a 12-month framework to draft
procedural rules under which commercial whaling would take place
if and when the moratorium was lifted.
<p>But, Britain, which supported the compromise, said it
remained adamantly opposed to commercial whaling but had voted
for the deal to safeguard the work of the IWC.
<p>The compromise reached at the IWC annual meeting in Adelaide
was a bid to end a decade of conflict over the rules for any
future resumption of whaling, amid growing concern about the
commission's future role as a regulatory body.
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="2">Rules For New Whaling</font></b></font>
<p>The IWC backed a proposal by 10 so-called moderate nations,
including Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland, to meet in February
to try to advance agreement on rules for whale-hunting ahead of
the commission's next meeting in London in mid-2001.
<p>The rules of the so-called revised management scheme (RMS)
would not cover quotas, but would spell out inspection and
monitoring procedures for future commercial whaling.
<p>Anti-whaling countries and groups want the rules to also
cover killing methods, domestic market inspections, and wider
environmental issues.
<p>Morley said Britain backed the RMS deal following
allegations that anti-whaling nations were ``deliberately being
obstructive'' but he said it was ``relaxed'' about the move.
<p>``We have not committed ourselves ... apart from agreeing to
a framework to take it forward,'' he told reporters. ``As far as
we're concerned, the procedure agreed today is a framework for
discussion, it doesn't actually fast-track it.''
<p>Environmental groups said they were disappointed with the
decision, warning that the new alignment of moderate nations was
splitting the IWC's anti-whaling block.
<p>But Campaign Whale spokesman Ottaway said Japan and Norway
still faced major hurdles and opposition from staunch
anti-whaling nations.
<p>``What is significant is some traditionally anti-whaling
countries are now looking for a compromise on the whole whaling
issue which has divided the anti-whaling movement,'' Ottaway
said.
<p>``And that is only going to benefit the whalers and not the
whales,'' he said.
<p>The IWC has expressed growing frustration at the deadlock
between whalers, mainly Japan and Norway, and anti-whaling
nations like the United States, Britain and Australia.
<p>Pro-whalers have urged Australia, which opposes outright any
return to commercial whaling, to quit the organization, saying
it is a whaling regulator, not a whale conservation body.
