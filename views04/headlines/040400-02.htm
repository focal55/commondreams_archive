<p>MEXICO CITY  - A coalition of
international  education
activists launched its Global Action Plan for Educationö Monday,
in an  effort
to secure the basic right to quality education for millions of the
world's
children. 
<P>
Led by the Brussels-based Education International (EI), a non-
governmental
organisation (NGO) of teachers unions, the coalition seeks to get
every  child
into primary school by 2015 through its initiative. <P>
The coalition, the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), had
scheduled press
conferences Monday in five cities -- Washington D.C., Sao Paulo,
Brussels,
Durban and New Delhi -- to identify those it hoped to win
endorsements from
for
its plan. <P>
Government leaders will top that list, states the GCE. It aspires
to put
pressureö on them to agree on its global plan before it is taken
up at the
forthcoming World Education Forum, to be held in Dakar, Senegal,
from Apr.
26-28. <P>
The urgency of the GCE's efforts stems from what it sees as the
failure o f
the
world's leaders to achieve the promised education for all,ö made
10 years  ago
at the World Conference on Education for All, held in Jomtien,
Thailand. <P>
A dismal catalogue of facts buttresses GCE's argument. Currently,
over 125
million children, two-thirds of them girls, are out of school.
Furthermore,
millions more drop out of school in the early grades, most of them
before
becoming literate. <P>
According to the GCE's estimates, if the current trend continues,
there
will be
57 million primary school age children out of school in 2015 in
Africa.  These
children will account for about three-quarters of all children in
the world
denied the right to education.ö <P>
In addition, studies conducted by the GCE reveal that the quality
of public
education is abysmal across much of the developing world.ö And
the  present
number of illiterate adults reflects this reality  close to 880
million,  more
than what it was in 1990.  <P>
To rectify this situation, the GCE's plan calls for national
education
policies
that guarantee at least eight years of free access to education
for  children,
whether through formal schooling or through equivalent quality
non-formal
programmes within the public system.ö <P>
To achieve success, furthermore, the plan stresses that education
policies
should pay attention to the following priorities:
7 Improved learning conditions, including properly equipped
classrooms, a
supply
of quality textbooks and fair and regular salaries for teachers.
7 Relevant, realistic and regular curricula.
7 Better student readiness, through early childhood development
programmes.
7 Effective measurement of progress, including monitoring of
indicators of
education quality.
7 Long-term financial stability.
7 Equity in education policy and spending, and the removal of
policies
(such as
cost sharing) which pose a barrier to the education of poor
children, girls
and
women.  
<P>
Such an initiative, states the plan, will require governments to
make a
concerted effort to mobilise political and financial resources.  
<P>
According to current estimates, the global cost of meeting the
GCE's target
works out to eight billion dollars a year. And to facilitate such
an
investment, the plan spells out the manner in which the financial
burden
should
be borne. 
<P>
Developing countries, for instance, are expected to mobilise half
of this
amount through increased resource mobilisation and the
redistribution of
wasteful public spending, such as military expenditure.
<P>
That can be achieved, argues the GCE, if governments give a higher
priority  to
education and strive to increase the total amount of resources
invested to  at
least six percent of a country's gross national product (GNP). 
<P>
As Elie Jouen of EI points out, It is time that  governments and
the
international financial institutions recognise education is a
fundamental
human
right and that provision of quality education for children, young
people and
adults is a core responsibility of the state. 
<P>
The international community, states the plan, will have to
mobilise funds to
meet the remaining half of this global education budget, for which
three  areas
have been identified. <P>
In the GCE's view, increased development assistance will have to
be the  major
contributor, by allocating at least eight percent of aid budgets
to basic
education, which will be a four-fold increase from the current
amount,
estimated at two percent of aid budgets. Through such a measure,
the GCE
expects to raise around three billion dollars of the annual
amount.  
<P>
The plan also intends using the current debt relief initiatives to
Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) to its advantage. What it proposes
is for a
significant slice of debt relief flows to be directed towards
basic  education.
Further, it also recommends that debt swap arrangements could be
developed to
finance education initiatives in middle-income countries. 
<P>
Private capital, according to the plan, will serve as the final
resource.
Here,
the GCE has funding from NGOs, foundations and other private
sources in  mind. 
<P>
Given the dire conditions in Africa, the plan makes a special
appeal for the
continent, under its section, A Compact for Africa.
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa faces particularly severe challenges in
education,ö  the
plan declared. It is now the only part of the developing world in
which  the
number of children out of school is increasing.
<P>
Failure to take cognisance of such needs, admits the GCE, will
only further
delay the provision of the right to education that has already
been denied  to
so many children. Without a concerted international effort, basic
education
for all will continue to elude us beyond 2015, with grave
consequences for  the
world's poorest and most vulnerable people.
