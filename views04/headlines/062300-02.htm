With Gov. George W. Bush's backing and his 
somberly stated conviction that ``justice is being done,'' the state of 
Texas last night executed Gary Graham, who had been convicted for the 1981 
murder of a man outside a Houston supermarket.	 
<P>  The execution was carried out even though five of the 18 members of the 
Bush-appointed parole board argued against it, and the U.S. Supreme Court 
also divided sharply over the issue, declining to review the case by a 5-4 
vote.	 
</P>
<P>  Graham -- exhibiting clear evidence of a struggle before he entered the 
death chamber and declaring, ``This is what happens to black men in 
America'' -- died by lethal injection at 6:49 p.m. after a protracted legal 
battle.	 
</P>
<P>  Observed by supporters of his victim and anti-death penalty activists 
including Jesse Jackson, Graham entered the room bound by black Velcro wrist 
restraints, handcuffed, and with a head restraint that fell loose as he 
spoke.	 
</P>
<P>  Graham gave a final rambling, angry statement, insisting he did not kill 
Bobby Lambert near a Houston supermarket 19 years ago. Facing Lambert's 
grandson from his gurney, he urged supporters to take his case to an 
international tribunal, calling his execution a lynching that is ``part of 
the genocide . . . that we as black people have endured in America.''	 
</P>
<P>  Outside the prison, about 500 protesters received the news as police 
helicopters roared overhead. Although a few members of the group had vowed 
violence if Graham were executed, the crowd instead seemed stunned and 
dejected.	 
</P>
<P>  Eight people were arrested for breaking through police lines and a 
juvenile was arrested for assaulting a prison administrator. Other activists 
burned American flags. Another 150 people protested outside the governor's 
mansion in Austin.	 
</P>
<P>  Protests were also held as far away as Northampton, Mass., and San 
Francisco. In San Francisco, police arrested 18 people after they locked 
arms and stood in the intersection of Seventh and Mission streets, tying up 
traffic for 20 minutes during the evening commute.	 
</P>
<P>  Alicia Jrapko, 47, of Pleasant Hill, said she welcomed arrest despite the 
seeming inevitability that Graham would soon be executed.	 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>``Even if they kill him, this has created a lot of controversy,'' she said. 
Earlier in the day, about 75 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Court of 
Appeals. Carrying signs that read ``Don't Kill Another Person,'' the 
marchers demanded Graham be given a new trial. Protesters distributed fliers 
calling the 131 executions in Texas during Bush's term as governor a 
``killing spree.''	 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> ``There is overwhelming evidence of Gary Graham's innocence,'' said Gloria 
LaRiva, a coordinator at San Francisco's International Action Center, which 
organized the protest. ``George Bush is committing an open, premeditated act 
of murder in order to get himself elected.''	 
</P>
<P>  Maria Harper, 38, came from Oakland in hopes that the protests in San 
Francisco and elsewhere would stop Graham's execution.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I have faith and hope, not in the system but in something higher,'' she 
said. ``Maybe all these protests will be heard.''	 
</P>
<P>  When the moment of Graham's execution arrived, Bush spoke solemnly to 
reporters instead of simply issuing a statement. 	 
</P>
<P>  ``This is a responsibility I take very seriously,'' Bush said, reading 
from a statement, ``because the final determination of innocence or guilt is 
among the most profound and serious decisions a person can make. I recognize 
that there are good people who oppose the death penalty. I have heard their 
message and I respect their heartfelt point of view.'``	 
</P>
<P>  Then he recited a series of heinous crimes attributed to Graham and noted 
that Graham had even confessed to some of them. He said that Graham's case, 
over the 19 years since the murder for which he was executed, had been 
reviewed ``more than 20 times by state and federal courts'' and by 33 
judges.	 
</P>
<P>  And he said he backed the board's vote yesterday afternoon to authorize 
the execution. ``After considering all the facts,'' he said, ``I'm confident 
that justice is being done.''
