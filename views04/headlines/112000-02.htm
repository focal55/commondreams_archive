Columbus, Georgia ---  Despite a steady rain and frigid temperatures 3,500 protesters demanding the closing of the U.S. Army School of the Americas  crossed Sunday into Fort Benning in what has become an annual ritual.
<p>
       By the end of the protest 1,700 people, including actor Martin Sheen, were arrested by military officials and received letters banning them from the post for five years. 
<p>
      At the head of the procession were people dressed in shrouds, wearing white masks and carrying coffins representing Latin Americans they say had been killed by people who had been trained at the school. When the protesters were nearly a half mile into the post, they set the coffins down, poured red paint on themselves and fell to the ground, refusing to get up. 
<p>
      When they refused to get on buses they were put into plastic handcuffs, photographed and placed on canvas litters to be processed.  
<p>
     The protests were led by the Rev. Roy Bourgeois. Military officials said that less than one percent of the students have been linked to any violence.
<p>
       Protesters came from across the country and included college students and Catholic nuns.
<p>
      "I think of this as kind of prayer. By our very presence we are standing for what we believe in," said Sister John Backenstos of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary order of McKenzie Bridge, Ore. The U.S. attorney's office in Macon will determine in the coming days if any of the protesters will be prosecuted on trespassing and other charges. They could be charged with criminal trespass, resisting arrest and assaulting a law enforcement officer.  
<p>
      Last year about 65 people were cited when they entered the post. But this year post commander Maj. Gen. John Le Moyne decided to cite more people because it gives "us an opportunity to engage in a dialogue about the school," Le Moyne said.
<p>
      Le Moyne said that instructors and chaplains at the school talked with protesters about the school's philosophy and curriculum.
<p>
       The school's commander, Col. Glen Weidner, conceded that the protests have had an impact. The school is scheduled to close next month and reopen in January with a new name, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. The school plans to feature more human rights courses and an oversight committee.
<p>
       In all, about 6,500 people, including Buddhist monks who walked from Atlanta, protested, including the 3,500 who went onto the post. Last year's protest drew about 12,000 people. 
<p>
     Hundreds of protesters carried crosses bearing the names of people who they say died at the hands of the military in Mexico and Central and South America. Before boarding the buses to be processed they planted the crosses into the wet ground. 
<p>
     Sheen and others in the front knelt on the pavement, waiting for the military police. When they didn't come, he said, "Let's go to Muhammad" and walked to the waiting buses along with the others. People carrying crosses were asked by police to leave them. Many protesters forced the crosses into the ground before boarding buses. 
<p>
     The protests coincide with the Nov. 16, 1989, murder of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter. A United Nations truth commission found that 19 of the 26 soldiers implicated in the deaths were SOA graduates.
<p>
      Alisa Daubenspeck, a senior at Oberlin College in Ohio, said it was important for her to be at Sunday's protest because "we elect the people that fund this school."
