<p>Even as President Clinton joins the growing call for DNA testing of
inmates--and despite the 64 wrongly convicted U.S. prisoners freed after
testing--only two states give inmates such a right, and many prosecutors
actively resist it.Last week, Clinton, who supports capital punishment, said he is
"favorably disposed" toward legislation recently introduced by Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that would make it easier for inmates to obtain
DNA tests that they believe could prove their innocence.

<p>A similar bill proposed by state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
(D-San Francisco) is before the California Legislature, and measures are
being drafted in Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington.
<p>In the meantime, obtaining a DNA test for an inmate, outside of New
York and Illinois, often "is like a war," said lawyer Barry Scheck,
co-founder of the Innocence Project at New York's Cardozo Law School,
which has led the way in using DNA tests to overturn wrongful
convictions.
<p>For example, Clyde Charles walked out of Louisiana's Angola prison
just before Christmas, having been exonerated of a rape conviction as a
result of DNA tests conducted 18 years after he was sentenced to life
without parole. But Charles, whose conviction rested primarily on
identification by the victim, had to fight a nine-year battle to get the
biological evidence tested. A district attorney agreed to the tests only
after Scheck and Innocence Project co-founder Peter Neufeld filed a
federal civil rights suit challenging Louisiana's refusal to permit the
tests.
<p>The suit asserted that refusing to grant Charles access to evidence
that could prove his innocence violated his constitutional right to due
process of law. In particular, the suit alleged that, under the landmark
1963 Supreme Court decision in Brady vs. Maryland, the prosecution was
obliged to disclose anything that might bear on Charles' guilt or
innocence.
<p>It also contended that continuing to incarcerate Charles for a crime
he did not commit violated the Constitution's prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishment when a "truly persuasive showing of actual
innocence can be made"--and that this could be done with DNA testing.
<p>"The quest for truth does not terminate with a defendant's
conviction," the attorneys said.
<p>The Innocence Project recently filed similar lawsuits in Baton Rouge,
La., and Orlando, Fla. Plans are underway to file others in several
states--including Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and
Pennsylvania--where prosecutors are resisting testing.
<p>These legal challenges come at a time when two conflicting forces are
intersecting. On the one hand, the demonstrated potency of DNA
evidence--which can include semen, blood or even fingernail scrapings--is
growing in importance not only to defense lawyers but also to
prosecutors, who have used it to help secure hundreds of convictions
around the country.
<p>On the other hand, the availability of DNA evidence has precipitated
thorny legal issues because post-conviction testing requests do not fit
neatly into court rules or U.S. legal doctrine, which has made it
increasingly difficult in recent years for inmates to challenge
convictions.
<p>In September, the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence,
appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, said the wave of DNA-based
exonerations over the last decade, including five in Canada, had weakened
"the strong presumption that verdicts are correct." That presumption has
been one of the underpinnings of restrictions on inmates obtaining
post-conviction relief.
<p>The commission recommended that in situations "where DNA can establish
actual innocence," prosecutors should agree "to the pursuit of truth"
rather than invoking laws that prohibit introduction of new evidence
because of the passage of time.
<p>The panel also urged judges to waive statutory time limits for
consideration of newly discovered evidence in such situations.
<p>Additionally, the commission recommended that prosecutors and defense
lawyers try to work cooperatively in situations where DNA may help
determine innocence, although it may not be absolutely conclusive.
Defense lawyers also were urged not to file DNA-based appeals in
situations where it is clear that testing would be of no value in
determining innocence.
<p><b>DNA Tests Expose System's 'Fallibility'
</b>
<p>Leahy's bill, which is expected to face hearings later this year, is
an attempt to put those recommendations into federal law. "Perhaps more
than any other development, improvements in DNA testing have exposed the
fallibility of the legal system," said Leahy, a former prosecutor.
<p>His measure would prohibit the government from destroying biological
evidence from a crime scene without 90 days notice, during which time an
inmate could request DNA testing.
<p>That is important, Scheck said, because in many parts of the country,
evidence is not retained long enough. He said that in 70% of the cases in
which inmates have asked the Innocence Project for help, it turned out
that the biological evidence had been destroyed.
<p>Another impediment to using DNA is that most states have time limits
on when newly discovered evidence can be introduced.
<p>Some judges have cited such laws in refusing to permit post-conviction
testing, but others have ruled that the statutes should not be a bar to
getting at the truth.
<p>New York courts first confronted the issue in 1990 in the case of
Charles Dabbs, who was convicted of rape in 1984--before DNA testing was
available and before New York enacted its post-conviction testing law.
<p>Dabbs sought tests of semen and other bodily secretions recovered from
the victim's panties, a gauze pad and rape test slides. His conviction
was based largely on identification by the victim, who testified that she
had not had sexual relations for at least 24 hours before the attack.
<p>Prosecutors resisted testing on the grounds that there was no
statutory right and that the results were speculative. They also argued
that if the judge granted the motion, it would set a precedent that would
lead other convicted sex offenders to demand DNA testing.
<p>The court disagreed. Judge Nicholas Colabella ruled that a defendant
has a right to be informed of exculpatory information known to the
state--and that the state has a duty to preserve the material.
<p>"To deny [Dabbs] the opportunity to prove his innocence with such
evidence simply to ensure the finality of convictions is untenable," the
judge said. "Mistaken identification probably accounts for more
miscarriages of justice than any other single factor."
<p>The testing was done, and Dabbs was exonerated.
<p>Courts in Indiana, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have issued similar
rulings. But courts in other states, including Florida, have ruled
against testing.
<p>Even in Illinois--which has a statute permitting post-conviction
testing and has had 14 DNA-based exonerations, more than any other
state--judges have differed on the showing a defendant has to make to
qualify for testing.
<p>California, unlike most states, has no law limiting when newly
discovered evidence can be introduced. In theory, that makes it easier
for an inmate to get DNA testing. But the path is not always swift.
<p>In recent years, men convicted of sexual assaults in Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties have been freed as a result of
DNA tests.
<p>Kevin Green was convicted of sexually assaulting his wife in 1980,
before DNA testing was available. He served 17 years before another
prisoner told police that he was the perpetrator. As soon as Gerald
Parker confessed, the Orange County district attorney's office initiated
DNA testing of evidence, which showed Green could not have been the
rapist. He was freed.
<p>But in other cases, it has taken inmates a long time to get testing.
<p>For example, San Diego defense lawyer Carmela Simoncini launched
efforts to get DNA testing for Frederick Daye in 1990, after she learned
that another inmate convicted of the same rape and kidnapping had signed
a sworn affidavit stating that Daye was not his accomplice.
<p>After a lengthy legal battle, Simoncini finally convinced a judge to
permit the DNA testing that cleared Daye in 1994.
<p>And in a case just resolved in Riverside, it took three years after a
Cardozo student working for the Innocence Project discovered that
relevant biological evidence had been preserved to get a judge to release
it for testing.
<p>DNA tests done for the defense late last year showed that Herman
Atkins--who got a 45-year sentence in a 1986 rape case--could not have
been guilty. FBI testing confirmed forensic scientist Edward Blake's
results and, on Thursday, the Riverside district attorney's office asked
a judge to set aside the conviction and order Atkins' release.
<p>Neufeld said that Atkins could have gotten out of prison three years
earlier if prosecutors had agreed to testing when the student learned the
evidence was available.
<p><b>Riverside to Adopt New DNA Policies</b>
<p>Riverside Dist. Atty. Grover Trask said his office would adopt new
policies, in line with the DNA commission recommendations, a change that
should facilitate prompter testing.
<p>Neufeld also stressed that Atkins and Charles, both black men
convicted of raping white women, are typical of the Innocence Project's
clients. Nationally, he said, only 11% of rapes are cross-racial--but
almost half of the individuals the project has helped free were convicted
in cross-racial rape cases that involved mistaken identification.
<p>Assistant Dist. Atty. Norman Gahn of Milwaukee, who serves on the DNA
commission with Scheck, said he and many other prosecutors feel that if
DNA can be used to convict someone "and send him away for life," then
prosecutors should be open to its use to prove innocence.
<p>However, both Gahn and George "Woody" Clarke, a deputy district
attorney in San Diego who also is on the DNA commission, expressed
reservations about enacting a statute that mandates post-conviction DNA
testing according to set criteria. They said they feel it is important
that judges retain the discretion to bar testing based on the
circumstances in a particular case.
<p>Other prosecutors have expressed concern that permitting DNA tests
years after a conviction is upheld on appeal raises the specter that no
verdict will ever be final.
<p>But Scheck and Neufeld maintain that obtaining conclusive scientific
results to establish innocence or guilt should trump other concerns.
<p>"Finality is a doctrine that can be explained in two words when it
comes to innocence tests: 'willful ignorance,' " Scheck and Neufeld
declare in their recently published book, "Actual Innocence."
<p>Myrna Raeder, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles
who closely follows cases involving the use of DNA, offered a similar
assessment.
<p>"When you have a tool like DNA that can render definitive proof of
innocence," invoking finality as the most important goal "is a smoke
screen," Raeder said. Consequently, it would be wise to enact legislation
with clear criteria for testing eligibility so that the decision about
who gets a test "is not left solely to the whim of a prosecutor or
judge."
