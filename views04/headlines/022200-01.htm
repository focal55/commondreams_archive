<p>KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia<wbr>--<wbr>As Serbs sang nationalist songs and cheered on their side of this
divided Kosovo city, NATO troops battled a surging crowd of about 70,000
ethnic Albanians with tear gas Monday to prevent a potential blood bath.
<p>Ethnic Albanian protesters had marched about 25 miles from Pristina,
the provincial capital, to press demands for an end to the division of
Kosovska Mitrovica, which they see as part of an attempt to partition
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
<p>For more than three hours, British and Canadian soldiers, often bent
over and choking in pain from clouds of tear gas fired by French
gendarmes, struggled to hold their front line on a bridge over the Ibar
River, which separates the Serbs from the ethnic Albanians.
<p>Both Serbian and ethnic Albanian extremists have been blamed for
stirring up unrest in Kosovska Mitrovica, and while violence has dropped
sharply in the rest of Kosovo, the city symbolizes one of the main
failures of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission.
<p>Eleven months after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched
its airstrikes to end Serbian repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, the mission seems as far as ever from building a multiethnic
democracy in the province.
<p>The latest violence has left NATO troops in the bizarre, and
dangerous, position of defending an iron wall dividing a strategic town
that the peacekeepers' commanders repeatedly have promised to unite.
<p>Violence erupted Monday when ethnic Albanians from Kosovo's central
Drenica region, the birthplace of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army,
broke through a cordon of NATO armored vehicles and barbed wire.
<p>They tried to storm across the bridge to confront about 4,000 waiting
Serbs but were repeatedly driven back with volleys of tear gas.
Peacekeepers wrestled several ethnic Albanian protesters to the ground
and arrested them.
<p>But the rest of the marchers only regrouped, and several dozen managed
to swarm on top of at least one NATO armored vehicle. Some of the
protesters carried U.S. and U.N. flags in addition to the red-and-black
Albanian flag. Peacekeepers estimated the crowd at about 70,000.
<p>Trouble continued after the 6 p.m. nightly curfew, but the crowd
eventually dispersed.
<p>As the marchers approached the city earlier Monday, Agim Ceku, former
head of the now-disbanded KLA guerrilla force, met with NATO commanders
in Kosovska Mitrovica.
<p>Ceku now commands the Kosovo Protection Corps, which NATO set up as a
civilian force to deal with natural disasters, rescues and other civil
defense in Kosovo. But when NATO called on Ceku to help calm the crowd
Monday, he seemed to have a much more important, political role.
<p>The marchers came to Kosovska Mitrovica to help speed up the process
of finding a solution to the ethnic division and "also as a message to
the whole international community that the division is unacceptable,"
Ceku told reporters as he walked next to British and French officers.
<p>Serbian forces committed widespread atrocities against Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority and drove hundreds of thousands from Kosovo during 11
weeks of NATO airstrikes. When the ethnic Albanians returned, Serbs and
other minorities were attacked and driven from their homes.
<p>Many of the estimated 9,000 Serbs living in the northern part of
Kosovska Mitrovica came from other parts of Kosovo because they didn't
feel safe in their home villages and towns.
<p>On Feb. 2, two elderly Serbs died when an antitank rocket was fired at
a bus clearly marked with the acronym of the Office of the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees and guarded by two French armored vehicles.
<p>No one has been arrested in the attack, which occurred on a foggy
stretch of road in a mainly ethnic Albanian region of Kosovo. When Serbs
sought revenge in Kosovska Mitrovica, nine people died and scores were
injured.
<p>More than 1,000 ethnic Albanians fled the mainly Serbian northern
district of Kosovska Mitrovica. Many of them said Serbs had ordered them
to leave. But the United Nations says at least 2,000 ethnic Albanians
still live under NATO protection in the northern sector.
<p>&#160;In southern Kosovska Mitrovica, where about 9,000 ethnic Albanians
live, there are just seven Serbs left, and they are holed up in an
Orthodox church guarded by French troops.
<p>As violence flared on the main bridge across the Ibar on Monday, about
350 U.S. troops from the 82nd Airborne Division guarded the entrance to a
secondary bridge and did not come under attack.
<p>But at least one U.S. soldier on duty in the southern sector had two
swollen black eyes and dried blood on the bridge of his broken nose,
wounds suffered when Serbs hurled rocks and bottles at American troops
searching for illegal weapons Sunday.
<p>The French commander in Kosovska Mitrovica, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de
Sannes, ordered the U.S. reinforcements to withdraw from the mainly
Serbian district before the weapons search was complete.
<p>By the end of Sunday, NATO troops had confiscated 10 AK-47 assault
rifles, 10 older rifles, one Uzi submachine gun, one heavy machine gun,
seven boxes of plastic explosives and a hand grenade from northern
Kosovska Mitrovica.
<p>The troops reported taking a single handgun from an ethnic Albanian in
the southern sector. On Feb. 15, NATO peacekeepers found 10 rocket
launchers, 180 grenades and thousands of bullets in an Albanian ambulance
abandoned near a NATO roadblock south of the city, leaving little doubt
that Kosovo is still awash in illegal weapons on both sides of the ethnic
divide.
<p>&#160;In the swirl of tear gas Monday, NATO leaflets floated down from
helicopters flying low overhead, to deliver a message in Albanian: "Keep
cool in this situation, so you remain trustworthy cooperators. Be aware:
violence doesn't serve anyone."
