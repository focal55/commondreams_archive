OAKLAND, Calif., June 28 -- It 
was nearing 10 o'clock at night, but 
in the sweltering lecture hall that 
served as the stage for this political 
rally, the Green Party's nominee for 
president of the United States was 
still going strong.

<p>      He sharply criticized an "apartheid economy" that was benefiting 
only the rich, and he bemoaned the 
state of affairs in a country with "far 
more problems than it deserves and 
far more solutions than it applies." 
And he scoffed at the notion that he 
might be a spoiler, drawing enough 
votes away from Al Gore to tip the 
election to George W. Bush.

</font>
</font></td>
</tr>
</TABLE></font></font>"You can't spoil a system," the 
candidate, Ralph Nader, said, "that's 
spoiled to the core."

<p>      The audience of 300 people or so 
loved it, repeatedly breaking into applause and giving the 66-year-old Mr. 
Nader a standing ovation coming in 
and heading out.

<p>      It is impossible to know whether, 
as current polls suggest, Nader's 
Raiders will have more impact on 
the race than the Buchanan Brigades 
of the likely Reform Party nominee, 
Patrick J. Buchanan. But one thing is 
clear on the campaign trail with Mr. 
Nader, the country's best-known consumer advocate: he is running an 
exceedingly more energetic race 
than he did four years ago, when he 
essentially stood in as a protest candidate, spending less than $5,000, 
speaking rarely and taking 1 percent 
of the vote.

<p>      "This is the difference between a 
person running and a person standing still," he said by way of comparison to his 1996 White House bid.

<p>  He has campaigned in every state 
this year -- flying commercial coach 
class, frequently using his senior-citizen's discount -- and appears 
well on his way to his goal of raising 
$5 million, with the help of the direct-mail network he has built over the 
years and plugs from several big 
Hollywood names.

<p>      He may wind up as a passing phenomenon in this campaign, like former Senator Bill Bradley or Senator 
John McCain. But for now, Mr. Nader is attracting a lot of attention -- 
among the news media, among left-leaning voters who see him as a 
more reliably liberal voice than Mr. 
Gore, and among leaders of organized labor, who agree with his stands 
on trade. Mr. Nader is a staunch 
critic of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the World 
Trade Organization, both of which he 
depicts as evidence of a "corporate 
globalization" that harms worker 
rights and the environment.

<p>      Polls in recent weeks have put him 
at 5 percent to 10 percent of the vote.

<p>      It would be a  stretch to call Mr. 
Nader a natural politician, and his 
one-and-three-quarter-hour nomination acceptance speech on Sunday in 
Denver may have been a tad long. 
But he seems highly animated, and 
 has a lot of sound bites down. He 
even claims to be enjoying his life as 
a politician, though he chooses a 
rather grim analogy to explain why.

<p>      "Oh, I have programmed myself 
so that if something is important to 
do, it's enjoyable," he said in an 
interview on Monday, after speaking 
at a women's center in the Mission 
District of San Francisco.

<p>      "I mean, there are some professional people who do that, too," Mr. 
Nader continued. "A good doctor, if 
he believes it's important to treat 
people, he'll enjoy treating people, 
even though outsiders may say, 'Oh, 
my God, what horrible tragedies and 
near misses, what pain you're dealing with.' "

<p>      In Mr. Nader's depiction, most of 
the country is in pain.

<p>  "At no time in our history have the 
children of America been in such 
crisis," he said in San Francisco the 
other day. And most wage earners, 
he told the crowd here, are working 
harder and longer than ever but have 
less purchasing power than they had 
in 1968.

<p>   Mr. Nader sees the West Coast -- 
with its mix of liberals, radicals, 
environmentalists and others who 
lean to the left -- as a fertile ground 
for his campaign. And indeed in California, where Mr. Nader has been 
involved in tort initiatives and has 
campaigned for so-called "patient 
protection" and H.M.O.-reform initiatives, polls show his support in the 
5 percent to 7 percent range.

<p>       Though the number is small, much 
of that support comes at the expense 
of Vice President Gore, who most 
analysts believe has to carry California to win in November. But even 
with Mr. Nader campaigning hard in 
the state, Democrats here profess to 
be little concerned about his impact.

<p>    Rather than reaching out to Mr. 
Nader and his backers, they have so 
far been dismissive.

<p>  "Ralph Nader is a 66-year-old Corvair in this race ready to be rear-ended," said Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the California Democratic Party. "This is the most serious vote of people's lives and they're 
not going to throw it away."

<p>  Mr. Mulholland said his  party 
would not "waste one ad" campaigning against the Green candidate.

<p>     "Nader became famous because 
of the Corvair and he's been doing 
college campuses ever since," he 
 said. "And now he wants to be president? It's a joke; it's ridiculous. Only 
in America can someone completely 
irrelevant run for president."

<p>     Politically, Mr. Nader's message 
is a bit complicated. He says that he 
hopes his candidacy will energize 
turnout for Democratic candidates 
in close races for the House of Representatives, and thus help turn power 
over to House Democratic leaders, 
and away from the Republicans in 
the House leadership whom he calls 
"beyond the pale."

<p>      But at the presidential level, Mr. 
Nader has nothing but venom for Mr. 
Gore and President Clinton, whom 
he accuses of offering "some of the 
most intensive demonstrations of political cowardliness in American  history." He says the race offers voters 
two "Republicrat" candidates, barely distinguishable.

<p>      "The only distinction between 
Bush and Gore is the velocity with 
which their knees hit the floor when 
big corporations knock on the door," 
Mr. Nader said the other day in Los 
Angeles, campaigning outside a public housing project.

<p>      A seasoned political strategist 
might suggest that while Mr. Nader 
remains so hot, he should be barnstorming the country. He did follow 
up his nomination acceptance in 
Denver with the swing here, and he 
said he plans many such swings. But 
afterward, he headed back to Washington, D.C., where aides said he 
planned to spend the rest of the week.

<p>      Here in Oakland, speaking on Monday at a downtown school called the 
University of Creation Spirituality, 
Mr. Nader elicited hisses of agreement from the crowd when he blasted several big-name Democrats in 
California, including Gov. Gray Davis and Senator Dianne Feinstein. 

<p>        Among the central planks of his 
campaign are  pledges to enact universal health insurance, to change 
labor laws to make it easier for 
unions to organize and to eliminate 
corporate welfare.

<p>      If there was any good news for Mr. 
Gore out of the rally here, it would 
seem to be that Mr. Nader's crowd 
was, by and large, so left-leaning that 
many voters there were not even the 
vice president's to lose. Several people in the audience said they had 
voted for Green or Libertarian Party 
candidates in the past.

<p>      What seemed to resonate with 
them most was Mr. Nader's "honesty -- just the sense that nobody is 
going to own him," as Corine Thornton, a 77-year-old retired waitress, 
put it. She voted for Mr. Nader four 
years ago, Ms. Thornton said, because "I just was  no longer satisfied 
with voting for the lesser of two 
evils."

<p>      Mateo Williford, a 28-year-old self-described "traveling activist," rejected the idea that a vote for Mr. 
Nader was a wasted vote.   
<p>"If we're 
ever going to have the possibility of 
three, four, five political parties," he 
said, "we have to make the choice to 
start bringing those in."

<p>      Still, some people were not even 
sure about the whole electoral effort 
on Mr. Nader's  behalf.

<p>      "I'm disappointed that all this energy is being put into the political 
system," said Jonah Zern, 22, a recent Cornell University graduate 
with a degree in environmental policy. "I mean, the idea that one person 
can represent 250 million people is 
absurd."

<p>      Mr. Nader is not without potential 
 vulnerabilities. Eyebrows were 
raised recently when the financial 
disclosure statements of Mr. Nader, 
America's most famous corporation-basher, revealed that he was worth 
nearly $4 million, in large part because of some savvy stock investments in high-technology companies.

<p>      Mr. Nader scoffed at the notion 
that there was anything untoward 
about reaping such gains. He said 
that he lived on about $25,000 a year, 
giving away 80 percent of his after-tax income, and that any of his gains 
represented a "de facto philanthropic fund" for his favorite causes.

<p>      No one really expects it, but what 
if Mr. Nader wound up in "that corporate prison we used to call the 
White House," as he describes it, 
dealing with the lawmakers "who 
have turned Capitol Hill into Withering Heights"?

<p>      Would he find it all daunting? Mr. 
Nader thought about the question for 
a while, and replied no:     "First of all, 
I've been in Washington too long, I've 
seen what kind of characters were in 
power, who should have been daunted but weren't."

<p>  So, no, 'daunting' was not  the right 
word.

<p>      "I would find it challenging to be 
president," he said. " 'Daunting' has 
almost a stuck-in-the-headlights, taken-aback sense, that maybe you're 
surprised by what you find yourself 
having to cope with. I don't think that 
would be the case."
