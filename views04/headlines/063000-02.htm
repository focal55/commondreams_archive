WASHINGTON, June 29 -- Ralph 
Nader, the consumer advocate and 
Green Party candidate for president, 
sharply criticized the Clinton-Gore 
administration's energy policies today, asserting that the administration had set the stage for higher 
gasoline prices this summer by allowing oil company mergers in recent years.

<p> Addressing what has become one 
of the hottest issues in the presidential race, Mr. Nader said the administration was doing "too little, too 
late" about high gasoline prices by 
having the Federal Trade Commission investigate possible price gouging by the oil industry.

<p> He said a much broader investigation by the Justice Department and 
state attorneys general was warranted. He also called for increasing the 
nation's oil reserves and taxing oil 
companies' profits found to be excessive. 

<p> "They massage the public with 
rhetoric and they don't do anything," 
Mr. Nader said of the administration. 

<p> Mr. Nader, who is expected to 
draw most of his support from 
among Democrats, also ridiculed the 
energy proposals unveiled by Vice 
President Al Gore this week. Mr. 
Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, called for tax breaks and other 
financial incentives to encourage 
people to buy, and companies to develop, fuel-efficient cars, solar 
homes and other energy-saving 
products. 

<p> Speaking at a breakfast with reporters, Mr. Nader called the proposals rehashes of wrong-headed ideas. 
He asserted, for instance, the administration's efforts to encourage Detroit to build alternative-fuel cars 
had accomplished very little, at a 
cost of $1 billion to taxpayers.

<p> "This is probably the most one-sided deal ever in Washington history," he said. 

<p> Mr. Nader went on to label Mr. 
Gore "an environmental imposter" 
and a "gee-whiz techno twit" who 
had all but abandoned poor and 
working-class people in favor of corporate America, with its big campaign contributions. 

<p> Despite his attacks on Mr. Gore, 
Mr. Nader argued that his candidacy 
would be good for Democratic Congressional candidates because he 
would draw Democratic-leaning voters to the polls. And he took a few 
shots at Gov. George W. Bush, the 
likely Republican nominee.

<p> "The problem with George W. 
Bush is that he's beyond satire," Mr. 
Nader said. "He's the corporate welfare king of all presidential candidates."

<p> Asked what he says to those who 
consider his positions extreme, Mr. 
Nader replied that it was the corporate "criminals" and "freeloaders" 
who were the extremists. 

<p> "All these positions that I foster 
are just normal, old-fashioned positions," he said. A native of Connecticut, he added, "They are the kind of 
positions that people in New England 
used to take as a matter of course."
