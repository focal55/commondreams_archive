WASHINGTON  - Corporate power keeps growing and
growing. That's
the
message of a new report released here Monday by the left-wing
Institute
for Policy Studies, one year after anti-corporate demonstrators
and
self-described ''anarchists'' stalled World Trade Organisation
(WTO)
negotiations in Seattle.
<P>
The report, the latest in a series of annual studies on corporate
size
produced
by the Institute, notes that, of the world's 100 largest economic
entities, 51 are corporations and only 49 were countries measured
by annual
corporate sales and annual gross domestic product (GDP). 
<P>
Moreover, the world's 200 largest corporations have combined sales
greater
than the combined GDP of all countries but the world's 10 largest
economies
and
18 times greater than the combined annual income of the roughly 25
percent of
the world's population living on less than one dollar per day. 
<P>
Nor does it appear that all of these economic activity necessarily
provide
proportional benefits to these companies' workers. The profits of
the 200
largest companies - 82 of which are US based - grew 362.4 percent
over the
16 years between 1983 and 1999, according to the Institute, while
the
number of
people they employed grew by only 14.4 percent. 
<P>
And while their sales amounted to the equivalent of about 27.5
percent of
global GDP in 1999, the number of people employed by them directly
amounted
to only 14.4 percent of the global workforce, according to the
report. 
<P>
Its publication comes at a time of growing popular concern here
about
corporate power, illustrated most recently by a special feature
appearing in
the Sep. 11 edition of the influential Business Week magazine. The
article,
entitled 'Too Much Corporate Power?', found that, despite the
longest
period of economic expansion in US history, the US public was
increasingly
uneasy about corporate influence on their lives and communities. 
<P>
While almost half of respondents in a major poll sponsored by the
weekly
magazine and conducted by the Louis Harris polling organisation,
agreed with
the notion that what is good for business is good for most of the
citizenry,
two-thirds of those polled thought that large profits were more
important to
big companies than developing safe and reliable, quality products
for
consumers. 
<P>
It also found that the so-called ''New Economy'' of hi-tech and
information
companies - which have recently suffered serious setbacks in the
stock
market - are leaving workers and their families ''feeling
overworked and
stressed out''. 
<P>
And about three out of four respondents agreed that big companies
have too
much influence over ''government policy, politicians, and policy-
makers in
Washington''. 
<P>
''It's no longer a youth or hippie thing,'' the article stated.
''Today,
those angry at business come from all parts of US society.'' 
<P>
That sense helps explain the decision by Vice President Al Gore to
run a
quasi-populist campaign - in which he strongly assailed tobacco,
oil, health
insurance, and pharmaceutical companies - in the presidential
elections, a
decision which caught many by surprise given his own history of
friendliness
both to corporations and their political campaign contributions. 
<P>
For this year's campaign, according to the Institute, the 82 US
companies on
the Top 200 list made direct contributions to candidates through
political
action committees totalling more than 30 million dollars, not
counting many
times more that amount made in so-called ''soft-money'' donations
to parties
or interest groups directly involved in the campaign. 
<P>
Overall, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
corporations
outspent
labour unions 15 to one during this year's campaign. 
<P>
''The growing private power has enormous economic consequences,''
the report
states. ''However, the greatest impact may be political, as
corporations
transform economic clout into political power. As a result,
democracy is
undermined. This threat deserves to be one of the major issues on
the
political agenda.'' 
<P>
At the same time that they wield enormous political power in
Washington,
companies have been successful in resisting government or public-
interest
efforts to make their foreign operations more transparent,
according to the
Institute. Among information that US firms which do business
abroad are not
required to make public are data about the number of workers they
employ in
each country, the amount of toxic gases their plants emit into the
atmosphere;
the location of their plants or contractors; and their wage rates. 
<P>
Their influence is also illustrated by the extent to which they
avoid paying
taxes both here and abroad. One study by the Institute of Taxation
and
Economic Policy found that 44 of the 82 biggest US companies
failed to pay
the full standard 35-percent corporate tax rate during the period
1996-98,
while seven - Texaco, Chevron, PepsiCo, Enron, Worldcom, McKesson,
and
General Motors - of them actually received rebates that exceeded
the amount
of taxes they paid during that time. 
<P>
The liberal use of tax havens abroad has also reduced US corporate
tax
liability for overseas operations far below the rates at which
their foreign
profits have grown, according to the report. 
<P>
The 82 US firms among the world's top 200, as determined by
Fortune Magazine,
represent a substantial increase over 1995, when only 59 of the
top 200 were
US-based. At that time, Japan was a close second with 58, but,
with the
continuing effects of its long recession, Japanese firms now  
account for only 
41 of the 200 largest. 
<P>
The world's six largest companies as defined by 1999 sales are  
General Motors, 
Wal-Mart, Exxon, Mobil, Ford Motor, and the German company Daimler  
Chrysler in that order. As economic entities, they rate, 23, 25,  
26, 27 and  
28, respectively, behind the GDPs of the major western  
industrialised  
powers, China, Brazil, Mexico, India, South Korea, Russia, and  
Argentina. 
<P>
The world's biggest private employer in 1999 was Wal-Mart, whose  
global  
workforce has skyrocketed from 62,000 in 1983 to 1,140,000 last  
year. The  
report notes that while the retail chain, which has been expanding 
aggressively 
in Latin America, has undoubtedly created new-job opportunities  
for tens of 
thousands of workers, it remains ''notorious'' for its anti-union  
efforts and 
heavy reliance on part-time employees to whom it is not required  
to pay health 
or other benefits.
