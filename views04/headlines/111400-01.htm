NEW YORK -  Complaints continue to mount from African-
Americans
around the country who say they were prevented from voting or that
they
observed serious irregularities in last week's poll for the
nation's highest
office.
<P>
Among the obstacles reported were registration challenges,
intimidation,
misleading information, police profiling near predominately Black
polling
stations and ballot tampering.  
<P>
''The system is not working for us - again,'' said Florida
Congresswoman
Carrie
Meek, who added in a published report that she personally was
aware of
hundreds
of complaints from black voters.  
<P>
Reports of alleged voter fraud continue to emerge as well from
Florida
counties, now in the international limelight, including reports
from two
African-American weekly papers.  
<P>
In Fort Myers, Florida, Charles Weaver, publisher of the Community
Voice,
said:
''In Republican Country, (I) received at least a dozen calls from
people with
all kinds of apparent 'voting inequities.'''  
<P>
Visiting one of the polls himself, he said he witnessed
''intimidation,
harassment and apparent illegal activity'' at the precinct.  
<P>
''There were illegal poll watchers, threatening people, telling
them, 'I know
where you work. You're going to get fired.'''  
<P>
''One guy who lost his wallet was not allowed to vote because he
had no
identification - rather than asking him to sign a document stating
his
identification as (is legally) required,'' Weaver said.  
<P>
At another African-American weekly, Miami Times, Tonnette Collier,
a reporter,
said her newspaper got so many calls that she lost count. ''There
were a
lot of
elderly people. They were very upset,'' she said. ''It's so much
confusion,
it's unbelievable.''  
<P>
Many callers told of a police check point that was stopping cars
on a road
that
leads to the First Baptist Church of Woodville in Tallahassee,
Collier said.  
<P>
Major Ken Howes of the Tallahassee Highway Patrol confirmed that
his
department
did conduct what he called a ''routine'' check point on Oakridge
Road about
''2.1 miles'' from the precinct. He said the check, ''one of 31
that been
conducted in the last 30 days in this area,'' had nothing to do
with voting or
elections, but was to enforce laws pertaining to licenses,
insurance and faulty equipment on cars.  
<P>
Similar troubles were reported by Anita Hodgkiss, senior attorney
at The
Advancement Project and a former voting rights lawyer with the US
Justice
Department.  
<P>
Hodgkiss volunteered to work with other lawyers on a telephone
hotline taking
calls on direct intimidation or obstruction of potential voters.
'Apparently,
police in Newport News, VA were stopping people at checkpoints,''
she says.
''In St. Louis, Missouri, some voters there were turned away for
not having
their cards, while their White counterparts were allowed to vote.  
<P>
''We also got a lot of calls from ex-felons who wanted to vote,
but couldn't.
The good thing is that they were (calling from) states where they
could vote.
In Florida now, there is a legal challenge pending to the
disenfranchisement of
ex-offenders.''  
<P>
A statement released by the human rights group Human Rights Watch
noted that
Florida, being one of over a dozen states that denies the right to
vote to
ex-offenders, kept 400,000 (black and white) individuals out of
the election
booths. One third of African-American men in that state, or
200,000, cannot
vote because of a past felony arrest.  
<P>
Nationally, one in 50 adults, or nearly 4 million US citizens
cannot vote
because of felony records, and 1.4 million of them have completed
their
sentences and are not on probation or parole.  
<P>
In a 1998 report, the human rights group estimated that 30-40
percent of the
next generation of African-American men may be disenfranchised
because of
criminal records.  
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation's largest black civil rights group, the
NAACP (National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People), has asked
Attorney General
Janet Reno to investigate possible violations of constitutional
guarantees of
the right to vote.  
<P>
''On the surface, there appears to be a violation of the 15th
Amendment, which
guarantees minority voters the right to vote for the candidate of
their
choice,'' said Julian Bond, NAACP chairman, in a published report.  
<P>
The voter fraud allegations, said NAACP president Kweisi Mfume,
''raise
serious
questions about the fairness and accuracy of the election ... Our
sense is
that
the level and number of calls we received suggest very serious
problems,
perhaps even nationwide''.
