Monsanto, the international company that pioneered the use of genetically modified crops, has revealed that its most widely used GM product contains unexpected gene fragments, raising fresh doubts that the technology is properly understood.
<P>Two extra gene fragments have been found in modified soya beans that have been grown commercially in the US for four years and used as an   important ingredient in processed foods sold in Britain for a similar period.
<P>The company and the British government, which approved the soya's use in food and animal feed on behalf of the EU, yesterday insisted that the beans were no more risky to human health than conventional types. However, the revelation will cause further problems for ministers trying to prove they can manage and monitor the introduction of the technology.
<P>Monsanto alerted the Department of the Environment to the results of new studies on its Roundup Ready soyabeans on May 19, two days after ministers revealed that thousands of acres of oilseed rape had been grown unwittingly from conventional seed contaminated by GM material. German research has suggested that a gene used to modify rape seed could leap the species barrier into the guts of bees.
<P>Monsanto said the new studies used more advanced techniques to provide "updated molecular characterisation" of its beans which contain an inserted gene to ensure they are not destroyed by weedkiller. The tests found that two "inactive" pieces of genetic material were inserted at the same time as the whole gene. Dan Verakis, a spokesman for the   company, said: "All this means is we are able to see genes in soya more clearly now. It is like putting a telescope in orbit allows astronomers to see stars better."
<P>He insisted that the fragments were in the product when it passed safety assessments by US authorities in 1992 and in Britain in 1996.The company's letter to the government says that nearly 100m acres of such beans have been cultivated round the world since 1996 "without adverse impacts on the environment or human health. They have also been widely consumed in Europe in foods and animal feedstuffs without adverse effects." No GM soya is grown in Britain.
<P>The Department of the Environment said its own preliminary study "suggests that the risk from these beans when used in food or animal feed is no different from conventional soya beans". The in formation was considered by one advisory committee, on releases of GM material into the environment, last Thursday. The government has promised to publish its final verdict which will be passed on to the European commission.
<P>Andy Tait, GM campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: "This shows exactly what we have been saying for years, that genetic modification is inherently unpredictable and will have all sorts of knock-on effects once released into the environment." Soya is used in a wide range of foods. About half the US harvest is now thought to be GM.
