<p>SEATTLE <wbr>--<wbr> John Foss is a commercial fisherman who's seen his livelihood slip
further toward extinction under the Clinton-Gore administration. For
weeks, he has agonized about what to do.
<p>Vote for Ralph Nader, the only presidential candidate who wants to
tear down the salmon-killing dams on the Snake River? Or vote for Al Gore
for fear of handing the election to George W. Bush, the only man who
vowed the dams were there to stay?
<p>Finally, Foss decided--not to decide. At least, not until 7:55 p.m.
PST Tuesday, five minutes before the polls close in Washington state.
Foss has joined a growing number of Pacific Northwest progressives dubbed
the "7:55 Brigade." He wants to vote for Green Party nominee Nader but
back Gore, even if he hasn't taken a firm stand on the dams, at the last
minute if the race appears truly close.
<p>"A lot of people are going to wait until the last minute and see which
way the wind's blowing, and then drop their ballots. If it's close, then
I hold my nose and vote for Gore," said Foss, who also likes what Nader
has to say about genetically modified food, global trade and labor
rights.
<p>In the last few days before the election, the 38-year-old
environmental activist, and people like him, has become one of the
hottest properties of the Democratic campaign. Nader's
dwindling-but-significant numbers--6% in Washington, up to 10% in
Oregon--could make or break Democratic nominee Gore's chances in what is
otherwise a dead heat with Texas Gov. Bush, his GOP rival.
<p>Groups like the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League have mobilized last-minute phone banks to get out
the Democratic vote and warn potential Nader supporters of the costs--to
the environment, to the Supreme Court, to abortion rights--if Vice
President Gore loses.
<p>Leaders of Seattle's liberal establishment--from high-tech executives
to environmental activists and members of the Seattle City
Council--hosted an event at the city's legendary rock club, Crocodile
Cafe, to warn Democrats against going for Nader. "Be afraid. Be very
afraid of a Dubya administration," said the invitation.
<b><br>
<p>Anti-Nader Material Flows
</b>
<p>In a city that practically invented e-mail, in-boxes are flooded with
anti-Nader material, and four prominent ex-Green Party members in
Portland, Ore., held a public coming-out last week as "Greens for Gore."
<p>For their part, Nader supporters brought their man to town for a
rousing, last-minute rally Thursday, and they are mining, with phone
calls and thousands of street-corner fliers, the low-income neighborhoods
of South Seattle that have historically been an electoral no-man's-land.
<p>Far from tapping into Gore's base, party leaders argue, the Green
Party is drawing in people too disengaged and disappointed with
politics-as-usual to have voted at all.
<p>"One of the population segments we feel really responds to us is
obviously young people, but also lower-income people, people who are at
the kind of margins of society, said Chris Doran, who worked street
corners and a Safeway parking lot Friday. "There's a lot of people in
those areas we think the Democrats and Republicans don't necessarily go
out to."
<p>Two locals that broke with their national leadership and backed the
Green ticket--the Teamsters and the American Postal Workers--have been
phoning their memberships and urging them to ignore the AFL-CIO's Gore
endorsement and vote for Nader.
<p>The Pacific Northwest has gone Democratic in the last three
presidential elections, but the region has always been split over the
same issues that divide Gore and Bush. Large liberal enclaves around
Seattle and Portland battle rural timber communities on the coast and
farm towns east of the Cascades over such issues as logging in national
forests, tax policy, gun control and civil rights.
<p>The Nader factor threatens to upset that historical balancing act by
dividing the left. Timothy Harris, the director of Seattle's homeless
newspaper, Real Change, celebrated the mass movement for social change
that arose out of last year's street demonstrations against the World
Trade Organization--an ignition point for much of the Green Party's local
support--but he cautioned: "That was then. This is now. We may be about
to show the world what happens when progressives can't agree."
