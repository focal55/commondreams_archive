A group of wealthy philanthropists who disagree with the U.S. 
government's drug policy are mounting a national campaign to change it -- 
and they are using California to lead the charge.	 
<P>Proposition 36 -- a November ballot initiative that would send drug 
offenders to treatment instead of prison -- is just one of the steps the 
high-powered group, which includes billionaire George Soros, is using to 
slowly change the nation's drug laws.	 
</P>
<P>``The California proposition is regarded as the high profile anchor of a 
broader campaign to advance our drug policy,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, 
director of the Lindesmith Center, a foundation established to ``broaden the 
drug policy debate.'' Although the center is not directly involved in the 
proposition, it is Soros' creation and Nadelmann is an adviser to the 
campaign.	 
</P>
<P>Starting with California's Proposition 215 -- which legalized medical 
marijuana -- Soros and others have carefully used their money to go directly 
to voters on issues surrounding the nation's drug war.	 
</P>
<P>Nadelmann denies that the campaign is radical or that its ultimate goal is 
drug legalization.	 
</P>
<P>``For too long, drug policy has been based on ignorance, fear, prejudice 
and profit,'' he said. ``We support a policy based on common sense, human 
rights, science and public health.''	 
</p>
<b>FAVORING REHABILITATION
</b>
<P>The practical effect of the group's policy would mean legalized marijuana 
for medical purposes, access to methadone for heroin addicts and 
rehabilitation instead of prison, Nadelmann said.	 
</P>
<P>But opponents of Proposition 36 don't buy that.	 
</P>
<P>``This is not about treatment; it's an effort to legalize drugs,'' said 
Jean Munoz, a spokeswoman for the No on 36 campaign. ``Everybody in our 
coalition believes in treatment, but it has to be effective.''	 
</P>
<P>That coalition includes judges, parole officers, law enforcement groups and 
some health care professionals. 	 
</P>
<P>``Proponents frame the issue around treatment. It's not about treatment; 
it's about the decriminalization of hard-core drugs. It will undermine 
effective treatment programs,'' Munoz said.	 
</P>
<P>Supporters of California's proposition say it focuses on treating drug 
addiction as a health problem instead of a crime. The drug-treatment 
initiative would ban prison time for nonviolent first- and second-time drug 
offenders not charged with the sale, production or manufacturing of drugs.	 
</P>
<P>About 19,700 of the state's 162,000 prisoners are locked up for drug 
crimes, according to the state Department of Corrections.	 
</p>
<b>HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE
</b>
<P>Many drug users return again and again to jails and prisons. Drugs are 
considered to be the leading cause of the state's high recidivism rate among 
prisoners, which reached 67 percent in 1999, according to state documents.	 
</P>
<P>But opponents of the measure, including many law enforcement groups, argue 
that judges should be allowed to decide who are the best risks for probation 
and drug-treatment plans.	 
</P>
<P>``With drug courts there are consequences and accountability,'' said Munoz. 
``There is no money for drug testing in their initiative. There is no 
immediate sanction to compel them to get clean.''	 
</P>
<P>The nonpartisan legislative analyst says that within several years the 
proposition would result in a savings of between $200 million and $250 
million a year for the prison system. 	 
</P>
<P>The state would have to allocate $120 million a year to support the 
treatment programs.	 
</p>
<b>NATURAL PLACE FOR CAMPAIGN</b>
<P>California is a natural place to anchor the campaign, Nadelmann said.	 
</P>
<P>``California is a leader in many respects,'' he said. ``And it has an 
active ballot initiative process, which others don't have.''	 
</P>
<P>Four other states also have ballot initiatives in November on drug 
decriminalization -- Massachusetts, Oregon, Utah and Nevada -- and Soros has 
given nearly $900,000 to those efforts.	 
</P>
<P>The group uses ballot initiatives to go directly to voters, who Nadelmann 
said are more open to change.	 
</P>
<P>``We know a lot of things cannot move forward in legislation,'' he said. 
``There is too much political cowardice and dependence on drug war 
politics.''	 
</P>
<P>Soros and the two other contributors -- Peter Lewis, CEO of the Progressive 
Corp. and John Sperling, CEO of the Apollo Group, gave more than $1 million 
to the Proposition 36 campaign as of June 30.	 
</P>
<P>Other supporters of the measure include San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, 
the California Nurses Association and state Senate President Pro Tem John 
Burton of San Francisco.	 
</P>
<P>These elected leaders, along with others around the country, mean that 
Nadelmann's efforts are also starting to take hold through laws and local 
ordinances. The Hawaiian Legislature was recently the first to pass a 
medical marijuana law, and New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican, is 
working to make drug abuse problems fall under the health department instead 
of the state police.	 
</P>
<P>Public opinion is starting to sway elected officials, Nadelmann said.	 
</P>
<P>``People are saying enough is enough,'' he said. ``They 
are fed up with the rhetoric. Coercing people is not the way to get them 
better.''	 
<P>
</p>
<b>PROPOSITION 36
</b>
<P> -- What it would do: Proposition 36 will change state law so that most adult 
offenders who use or possess illegal drugs would receive drug treatment 
instead of jail time. State funds would be used to operate the drug 
treatment programs. Excluded from the program would be violent offenders and 
those who have failed treatment two or more times.	 
</P>
<P> -- Who is for it: San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, the California Nurses 
Association, California Labor Federation AFL-CIO, Senate President Pro Tem 
John Burton, D-San Francisco, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the 
Oakland City Council.	 
</P>
<P> -- Who is against it: Former Gov. Pete Wilson, Crime Victims United of 
California, California District Attorneys Association, California Peace 
Officers Association, the Betty Ford Center, and actor Martin Sheen.	 
</P>
<P> -- Major contributors: A handful of individuals account for almost all the 
money in this campaign. Financier George Soros, Peter Lewis, CEO of the 
Progressive Corp. and John Sperling, CEO of the Apollo Group, have 
contributed their own money for the ``Yes'' side, raising nearly 10 times as 
much as the ``No'' side, which received contributions from developer A.G. 
Spanos and the California Narcotic Officers Association PAC. 	 
</P>
<P> -- Bottom Line: If approved this measure would radically change the way the 
state handles drug offenses. It goes to the heart of whether drug offenders 
should be treated as though they have an illness, or must have a punishment 
such as prison time to scare them into getting straightened out. The measure 
takes power away from the police and courts, and gives it to treatment 
centers.
