With time running short, Al Gore is mounting a new advertising
blitz straddling two divergent political philosophies using the economic
record of Bill Clinton and the defense policies of Ronald Reagan.
<p>An ad expected to be released today says Gore, as a member of
Congress, "worked with President Reagan to modernize our ballistic
missile forces." In another spot, Gore tells viewers "You know, for the
last eight years, we've had the strongest economy in all of American
history."
<p>Particularly striking is Gore's invocation of the conservative former
Republican president, whose plans to build a new long-range nuclear
missile in 1983 won Gore's support in Congress.
<p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center
at the University of Pennsylvania, said it is highly unusual for a
candidate to invoke another party's leader in such a complimentary way.
She said the new ad risks reinforcing a traditional public view that
Republicans are stronger on foreign policy.
<p>"Ronald Reagan is remembered through very rose-colored glasses," she
said.
<p>Republican officials were also surprised at the reference. "Ronald
Reagan is an icon," said Terry Holt, a spokesman for the GOP. "He's
viewed as a world leader and identified with the best of the Republican
Party. Ronald Reagan was who he was, whatever the criticism, and Al Gore
is exactly the opposite."
<p>A Gore official defended the Reagan reference, saying it was designed
to spotlight the vice president's record of bipartisanship.
<p>The ad was also part of a national blitz the Gore campaign launched
Tuesday, spending an estimated $5 million in the coming week.
<p>Some of the ads are tailored to specific states. In one ad slated to
run in Gore's home state of Tennessee, where he is fighting an
unexpectedly close race, an announcer praises "Tennessee's Al Gore." In
another ad running in Nevada, an announcer says a Bush administration
would hasten the arrival of a nuclear waste dump in the state.
<p>Gore's stepped-up air assault comes as a lack of finances is forcing
his party to lower its profile on the airwaves. During the 10 days ending
Oct. 11, the GOP outspent the Democratic Party on television ads by about
$4 million to $749,240, according to Campaign Media Analysis Group, which
tracks spending in the largest 75 media markets.
<p>But the GOP's edge in airing ads funded partly with controversial
soft-money donations was erased by $3.65 million in TV ads purchased by
independent Democratic-allied groups during the period from Oct. 2 to
Oct. 11.
<p>For many of the independent groups backing the vice president, this
week essentially will mark their heaviest advertising of the campaign.
The organizations say they are airing their commercials late enough in
the race to hit voters at a time when they are paying attention but early
enough that they can be assured of securing air time.
<p>"We're peaking right now," said Daniel Weiss, political director of
the Sierra Club, which is spending about $2 million on TV ads criticizing
Bush's environmental record. The group spent more than $498,000 in the
10-day period and has plans to air Spanish-language ads in Florida and
New Mexico, where Bush is also running commercials in Spanish.
<p>Planned Parenthood, which supports abortion rights, spent about $2.8
million in the 10 days before Oct. 11, more than the Democratic Party
itself during that period, according to the campaign media analysis data.
<p>Nina Miller, director of the group's political arm, said the
organization will have spent about $7 million on the ad buy, which
includes three ads blasting Bush's stance on abortion. The ads will
rotate in eight pivotal states, airing during such programs as "The Rosie
O'Donnell Show" and on cable channels such as Lifetime and VH-1.
<p>Gore is also receiving support in ads from Handgun Control, which
spent about $353,950 during the two-week period, and the AFL-CIO, which
spent about $239,000 at the close of September.
<p>Ads by such independent organizations cannot be coordinated with the
candidates' campaigns under federal election regulations. Leaders of the
groups said they placed their ads where public polls and their own
research suggest they could most aid their candidate.
<p>On the Republican side, a pharmaceutical industry-funded organization,
Citizens for Better Medicare, has spent more than $34 million on ads
attacking the White House but not Gore by name.
<p>This week, the National Rifle Assn. went on the air with a new ad in
which NRA chief Charlton Heston attacks Gore. NRA officials say their
budget for political activities this year will be more than $15 million,
but so far the group has only spent about $250,000 on TV ads, according
to independent ad trackers. NRA strategists said the ads will run in
eight states but declined to say how much they were spending.
<p>Holt said groups normally associated with the Republican Party "are
generally more grass-roots driven." The independent spending by Gore
allies, he said, means that "they're throwing money at a problem but the
effect is there's a less coherent message coming from their campaign
overall."
