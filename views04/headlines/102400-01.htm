MIAMI --    Marie Sylvain, a longtime nursing home worker, was 
so upset about her low wages and workload -- feeding, washing, dressing and 
changing linens for 14 patients each shift -- that she decided to lead a 
unionization drive.	 
<P>  But her employer soon fired her, and the organizing drive quickly fizzled 
as her 70 co-workers feared they would also be dismissed if they pushed for 
a union.	 
</P>
<P>  That was 4 1/2 years ago. Today, Sylvain voices intense frustration that, 
because of extended legal appeals, she has still not been reinstated even 
though a judge ruled nearly three years ago that her firing violated the 
National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from firing or 
otherwise penalizing workers for supporting a union.	 
</P>
<P>  Sylvain is one of thousands of workers who are dismissed, demoted or 
otherwise punished each year for backing a union.	 
</P>
<P>  A recent study of National Labor Relations Board data showed that from 
1992 to 1997, employers fired or otherwise punished more than 125,000 
workers for supporting a union.	 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Numerous academic studies show that it often took three, four, even five 
years for fired workers to be reinstated, delays that union leaders say 
often cause organizing drives to die at a time when the labor movement is 
seeking to add hundreds of thousands of members and reverse its decades-long 
decline.	 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> ``U.S. labor law is stacked against employees who wish to organize a 
union, allowing employers to intimidate and coerce workers not to 
unionize,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO.	 
</P>
<P>  But some experts said unions are having troubles attracting more members 
not because of firings, threats and delays by the labor board but because of 
economic changes, especially the shift from manufacturing to services.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Job growth is coming where unions are historically weak,'' said Leo 
Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University. ``The economy is leaving 
unions behind. Employer behavior is virtually irrelevant to labor's decline. 
Employer behavior is an easy scapegoat.''	 
</P>
<P>  Labor's concern about obstacles to organizing is one reason labor is 
supporting Vice President Al Gore in the presidential race despite 
differences with him over trade.	 
</P>
<P>  In appearances at union conventions, Gore has vowed to push for changes 
that would make it easier for unions to organize workers.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Vice President Gore has been the most outspoken champion of the freedom 
to join a union since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'' Sweeney said.	 
</P>
<P>  A recent report by Human Rights Watch concluded that because of 
systematic violations by employers and long delays in obtaining legal 
redress, the United States was violating international agreements 
guaranteeing the rights of workers to form unions.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Most people view these issues as just a labor-management dispute,'' 
said Lance Compa, a Cornell University labor relations professor who wrote 
the report by Human Rights Watch, ``but we think the focus should be that 
there is a right of freedom of association recognized under international 
law, and that right is being widely denied in the United States.''	 
</P>
<P>  In the 1950s, several hundred workers suffered reprisals each year for 
backing a union, according to NLRB data. But Charles Morris, a professor 
emeritus at Southern Methodist University, said that by the late 1990s, 
employers carried out reprisals against more than 20,000 union supporters 
each year. He also found that one out of 18 workers involved in unionization 
drives faces some type of punishment for supporting the union.	 
</P>
<P>  Sylvain said her firing frightened other workers from backing a union at 
Palm Gardens nursing home.	 
</P>
<P>  ``They say, `Look what happened to Marie,' '' said Sylvain, who said she 
was paid $6.50 an hour, so little that she needed food stamps and Medicaid 
to support herself and her two children. ``The law gives you something with 
one hand, and then it takes it away with the other.''	 
</P>
<P>  But business groups argue that after eight years under President Clinton, 
the nation's enforcement is stacked against management, not unions.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Back in the 1950s, unions were fat and happy and represented 35 percent 
of the labor force,'' said Randy Johnson, vice president for labor policy at 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Now that they represent just 9 percent of 
private-sector workers, they're blaming the law for their problems.''	 
</P>
<P>  Many labor experts say the penalties that employers face for firing union 
supporters are so modest that it makes economic sense for companies to flout 
the law.	 
</P>
<P>  When the NLRB ruled that Ernest Duval and six other fired workers should 
be reinstated five years after a nursing home in Palm Beach fired them for 
leading a unionization drive, the labor board concluded that he was due 
$1,800 in back pay. The award was modest because federal law requires 
employers to pay the wages workers missed since their dismissal, minus 
whatever they earned in other jobs they took after being fired.	 
</P>
<P>  The Human Rights Watch report said: ``An employer determined to get rid 
of a union activist knows that all that awaits, after years of litigation if 
the employer persists in appeals, is a reinstatement order the worker is 
likely to decline and a modest back-pay award. For many employers, it is a 
small price to pay to destroy a workers' organizing effort by firing its 
leaders.''
