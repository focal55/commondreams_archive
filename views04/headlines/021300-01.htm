<p align="center"><img src="images/021300-01.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Joyce &amp; Charles Horman.">
 <img src="images/021300-02.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Charles Horman">
<p align="left">Twenty-six years ago, as the 
forces of Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
overthrew the Socialist government 
of Salvador Allende, two American 
supporters of President Allende 
were killed in Chile under circumstances that stirred suspicions of 
C.I.A. involvement. 

<p> American officials categorically 
denied any role in the young men's 
deaths, which were dramatized in 
the 1982 movie "Missing."

<p align="center">
<p> Compelled by the Freedom of Information Act, the government in 
1980 released the results of classified 
internal investigations, heavily censored in black ink, that appeared to 
clear the American and Chilean governments of any responsibility.

<p> But now, those thick black lines 
have been stripped away. Spurred by 
the arrest of General Pinochet in 
1998, President Clinton has ordered 
the declassification of "all documents that shed light on human 
rights abuses, terrorism and other 
acts of political violence during and 
prior to the Pinochet era in Chile." 

<p> Some of those documents make 
clear for the first time that the State 
Department concluded from almost 
the beginning that the Pinochet government had killed the men, Charles 
Horman, 31, and Frank Teruggi, 24. 
The investigators speculated, moreover, that the Chileans would not 
have done so without a green light 
from American intelligence.

<p>  "U.S. intelligence may have 
played an unfortunate part in Horman's death," said one newly declassified memo. "At best, it was limited 
to providing or confirming information that helped motivate his murder 
by the government of Chile. At worst, 
U.S. intelligence was aware the government of Chile saw Horman in a 
rather serious light and U.S. officials 
did nothing to discourage the logical 
outcome of government of Chile 
paranoia." 

<p> With most of the  blacked-out portions  now restored, the documents 
declassified by the State Department 
illustrate how exemptions in the 
Freedom of Information Act -- a law 
that was  meant to reduce secrecy -- 
can be misused.

<p> Two principal exceptions that the 
department used allow the government to withhold information on the 
grounds of national security and executive privilege. "They're not protecting national security information 
at all," said Peter Kornbluh of the 
nonprofit National Security Archives, which promotes the declassification of government documents. 
"Preventing embarrassment is not 
an exemption clause." 

<p>  Even after extensive Senate intelligence committee hearings in the 
1970's, the American role in the overthrow of Mr. Allende  remains a matter of dispute and conjecture. Mr. 
Kornbluh said that other government agencies responsible for carrying out United States policy in Chile, 
including the C.I.A. and the Pentagon, have so far failed to release key 
records on the era. 

<p> Regarding Mr. Horman's death, 
Mark Mansfield, a spokesman for 
the C.I.A., recently released a 22-year-old letter denying any role by 
the agency and said it would show 
the public files on the case this 
spring. 

<p> The State Department refused to 
address questions about the two 
deaths, saying few of the people involved in the case still work for the 
government. The former officials, 
most of them retired and scattered 
around the country, largely disavow 
any responsibility for what happened. 

<p> Mr. Horman's widow, Joyce, is 
hoping that enough has changed to 
finally learn what really happened to 
her husband. She is asking for Washington's help in her quest for an 
honest explanation of his murder 
from the new Socialist  government 
in Chile.

<p>  "I want to know who gave the 
order," said Mrs. Horman, who has 
never remarried. "Nobody's held accountable."

<p>  Her husband and Mr. Teruggi 
were friends who  belonged to a group 
of young left-of-center Americans attracted by Mr. Allende's socialist experiment in the early 1970's. In Santiago, they worked for a newsletter 
that reprinted articles and clippings 
from American newspapers critical 
of United States policy. 

<p>  When General Pinochet seized 
power on Sept. 11, 1973, Mr. Horman 
was at  Vi&ntilde;a del Mar, a coastal resort, 
 with Terry Simon, a family friend 
from New York who was vacationing 
in Chile. 

<p>  Ms. Simon said she and Mr. Horman saw American warships offshore and spoke to American naval 
officers stationed in nearby Valparaiso, who appeared elated at the 
coup's success. The two interpreted 
what they saw as proof of American 
connivance in the military takeover.

<p>  Eager to return to Santiago, they 
 rode back with Capt. Ray E. Davis, 
chief of the United States Military 
Group at the American Embassy, 
who had been making his weekly 
visit to the naval station. 

<p>  Two days later, as General Pinochet's forces moved to arrest thousands of people around the country, 
men in military uniforms abducted 
Mr. Horman, ransacking his apartment. His wife, Joyce, was out at the 
time. She never saw him again. Ms. 
Simon searched with Joyce  for Mr. 
Horman and eventually flew home to 
New York. 

<p> Around the same time, security 
forces arrested Mr. Teruggi and his 
roommate, David Hathaway, at their 
apartment. They were held at the 
national stadium with thousands of 
other political prisoners. Mr. Teruggi 
 never returned from his  second interrogation.

<p> Mr. Hathaway was released alone 
and later flew home to the United 
States.   
<p>A friend identified Mr. Teruggi's body in the government morgue. 
His  throat had been slashed, and he 
had been shot twice in the head.

<p> The search for Mr. Horman was 
more tortuous. His father, Edmund, 
flew in from New York to help. He 
and Mr. Horman's wife followed 
whatever leads they could, keeping 
in close touch with the embassy, 
which supplied escorts and pressed 
Mrs. Horman for a list of her husband's friends. Doubting the diplomats' motives, she says, she never 
supplied it. 

<p> Captain Davis, now 74 and retired, 
said in a recent interview that he had 
nothing to do with the deaths and he 
appeared offended by the resurgence 
of questions about the killings. 

<p> He talked  of his close ties to the 
Chilean military during his time 
there and said he had welcomed General Pinochet at his home, but was in 
no position to demand that Chilean 
Army commanders answer for the 
killings, and had not been ordered to 
do so. "We weren't down there to 
cause trouble," he said. "We sold 
them weapons."

<p> He called Mr. Teruggi and Mr. 
Horman "part of the problem" in 
Chile. "They were down there handing out pamphlets against the government," he said.

<p> The two men, actually, had been 
supporting the Allende government, 
not the one Captain Davis hoped to 
see in power. He corrected himself: 
"against the people who were trying 
to do something about it."

<p> The Hormans have long contended 
that despite the embassy's avowal 
that it was doing all it could to find 
Charles, its officials would merely 
confirm information the family had 
obtained for itself. Taken together, 
the newly released documents support  their suspicions.

<p> It was not until 1976 that the  State 
Department took a critical look at 
the killings. The move was prompted 
by a disaffected Chilean intelligence 
officer, Rafael Gonz&aacute;lez, who told 
reporters that he had witnessed Mr. 
Horman  being held prisoner  by 
Chile's chief of intelligence. 

<p> Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez quoted the intelligence chief as saying Mr. Horman 
"had to disappear" because he 
"knew too much," and said a man he 
presumed was American was  in the 
room.

<p> Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez also described a 
"cozy relationship" between American and Chilean intelligence services 
to destabilize the Allende government, and said that American operatives had even given their Chilean 
counterparts lists of suspected leftists to be rounded up in the first days 
of a military takeover. 

<p> (In its hearings, the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence found that 
the C.I.A. had in fact compiled arrest 
lists but said it had no evidence that 
they were passed to the Chileans. 
Those lists are among the documents 
the C.I.A. has not released.)

<p> Facing pressure from Congress, 
the State Department ordered two 
internal reviews in 1976. The first, 
completed in August, was carried out 
by Rudy V. Fimbres, regional director for Bolivia and Chile in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. The 
second was conducted by Frederick 
Smith, a State Department lawyer, in 
November and December.

<p> The investigators were permitted 
to examine only documents either 
publicly released or already available in the State Department. Their 
reviews appeared to confirm doubts 
and inconsistencies that American 
newspapers had already reported 
but that State Department officials 
had repeatedly discredited. 

<p> The documents showed that an 
embassy official had received a tip 
that Mr. Horman had already been 
killed before his father arrived in 
Chile. That tip  was not followed up. 

<p> Instead, embassy officials told Edmund Horman that leftists may have 
kidnapped his son, contradicting 
their own cables home, which quoted 
neighbors who said they had witnessed Chilean security forces taking Mr. Horman away.

<p>  The internal reviews also questioned the time of Mr. Horman's 
death, saying there was no reason to 
accept the Chilean government's assertion that he died just before the 
American Embassy learned of his 
disappearance. 

<p> The Pinochet government had ignored numerous requests from the 
United States for an autopsy report 
on Mr. Horman, the documents show. 

<p> One review asked why Captain Davis, who had driven Mr. Horman and 
Ms. Simon to Santiago, had taken 
their registration card from the hotel 
where they were staying. 

<p> Captain Davis at first denied that 
he had taken the card, but changed 
his mind when read a passage from a 
letter he wrote to one of the investigators, now among the declassified 
documents, mentioning the registration card.   
<p>"I don't see why it's important," he said. 

<p>  The Horman family believes the 
card was given to the Chilean military, and tipped them off to the new 
address of the Hormans, who had 
moved just a few days before. 

<p> "Based on what we have," the first 
inquiry concluded, "we are persuaded that the government of Chile 
sought Horman and felt threatened 
enough to order his immediate execution. The government of Chile 
might have believed this American 
could be killed without negative fall-out from the U.S. government."

<p> The memo said that there was 
"circumstantial evidence" that the 
C.I.A. "may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death," as 
well as Mr. Teruggi's. It also said the 
State Department had the "responsibility" to refute baseless allegations 
and "to proceed against U.S. officials 
if this is warranted."

<p> The second investigation, completed a month before Gerald Ford's 
presidency ended, drew a similar 
conclusion. It blamed the Chilean 
government for both deaths and said 
it was "difficult to believe" that the 
Pinochet government would have 
carried out the killings without some 
signal, perhaps even an inadvertent 
one, that the deaths would not cause 
"substantial adverse consequences" 
in Washington. 

<p> The memo -- to Harry W. Shlaudeman, the assistant secretary of state 
for inter-American affairs -- recommended interviewing Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez, 
the disaffected Chilean intelligence 
officer, again and going back to the 
C.I.A. for a full accounting. 

<p> "If an explanation exists," a 
memo in the investigation said, "it 
does not appear in the files and must 
be sought elsewhere." 

<p>  But both inquiries appear to have 
ended there. Mr. Shlaudeman himself recommended interrogating Mr. 
Gonz&aacute;lez further, even submitting a 
detailed list of questions for the purpose that the C.I.A. was allowed to 
review. But he dismissed the call for 
investigating the actions of the C.I.A.

<p>  Interviewed recently, Mr. Shlaudeman said that he remembered little 
about the issue. "A lot of things have 
happened since then," he said. 

<p>  Until jarred loose by General Pinochet's arrest in London in October 
1998, these reports remained largely 
hidden from the public. 

<p>  In 1978, State Department officials 
debated how much of the documents 
to show the Horman family, which 
was then suing the United States 
government for "wrongful death," a 
case that was dismissed "without 
prejudice," meaning that it could be 
reopened. 

<p> One official, Frank McNeil, then 
deputy assistant secretary of state 
for inter-American affairs, urged the 
department to err on the side of 
greater disclosure.

<p> "Classification should not be used 
to prevent embarrassment of government agencies or officials, which 
would be the principal reason for 
withholding when one gets down to 
the bone," he said. 

<p> Nonetheless, the documents released to the Hormans omitted large 
swaths of material on the grounds of 
national security and executive privilege.

<p> Experts note that executive privilege protects the president's deliberations with his advisers, in this instance Henry A. Kissinger, who 
served Presidents Richard M. Nixon 
and Gerald R. Ford as secretary of 
state. 

<p> Dr. Kissinger said  he had never 
seen the documents or the recommendations and  had been  out of the 
country much of the time. "It's very 
easy, 30 years after the event, to be 
so heroic and to create the impression that one had nothing else to do 
except follow one particular case," 
he said.   
<p>"If it were brought to my 
attention I would have done something." 

<p> Mr. Fimbres himself, who is now 
retired, said recently that he was not 
surprised at the State Department's 
apparent failure to pursue the investigation further. 

<p> "Something like this easily goes 
into the black hole," he explained. 
 "And everybody watches it go 
down."</p>
