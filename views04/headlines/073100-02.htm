Ralph Nader's vice presidential running mate in 
the strongly environmental
Green Party says the Makah Indian tribe has a 
right to hunt gray whales.
Winona LaDuke's position has angered ani-whaling 
activists who continue to
pressure the governmen to halt permanently the 
Neah Bay tribe's whale
hunting.
<P>

The tribe hunts whales under an 1855 treaty with 
the United States. The
treaty guarantees whaling in exchange for lands 
covering much of the Olympic
Peninsula.
<P>
LaDuke doesn't condone the slaughter of whales, 
said her press secretary,
Paul Demain, but she upholds established tribal 
treaty rights. "She said
that fundamentally the Makah have a treaty right 
to hunt whales," Demain
said. LaDuke supports the Makah "abiding by the 
opportunity provided by law
to hunt whales," he added.
<P>
LaDuke -- who will appear on the nation's ballots 
along with presidential
candidate Nader, the famed consumer advocate -- is 
an Ojibway activist who
lives on the White Earth Reservation in northern 
Minnesota. She founded the
White Earth Land Recovery Project in 1991 to buy 
back lost tribal lands to
her reservation.
<P>
As an American Indian with treaty rights to hunt 
and fish in northern
Minnesota, LaDuke had little doubt as to 
supporting the Makah whaling,
Demain said. "It's doesn't appear that within the 
(national) party it's
causing great concern," Demain said. "It is 
causing a great deal of concern
within Green Party groups in the Northwest."
<P>
"Apparently, the slaughter of defenseless gray 
whales within the waters of a
National Marine Sanctuary does not rate high 
enough to be included in (the
Green Party's) definition of 'the web of life,'" 
said Dan Spomer of the
Washington Citizen's Coastal Alliance."We are 
increasingly distressed at the
ability of the Green Party to even identify the 
facts surrounding the
ongoing slaughter, let alone make a coherent 
policy decision."
<P>
Gray whales were taken off the federal endangered 
species list in 1994. The
population of migratory gray whales is estimated 
at 26,000.
<P>
Last year 278 dead whales were reported washed 
ashore along their migratory
route from Mexico to Alaska. This year more than 
300 dead whales have been
reported. LaDuke argues that the focus of the 
Makah whaling debate should be
on the environmental issues that influence the 
beasts' survival.
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION
<P>
LaDuke believes that the use of Navy sonar and 
changes in habitat and
climate should be investigated for their impact 
on the whales, Demain said.
<P>
The Green Party of Seattle discussed Makah 
whaling at a meeting in May 1999,
one week after the tribe killed its first whale 
in more than 70 years. The
Seattle group did not take a stand.
<P>
But it did agree on a statement decrying both 
racism aimed at American
Indians after media coverage of the hunt and "the 
alternate demonization of
animal rights activists who oppose the hunt."
<P>
"As an organization that is profoundly concerned 
with the protection of the
environment as well as future sustainability, we 
recognize the importance of
the American Indian people and their cultural 
heritage to the rest of
society as we reverse the destruction done to the 
Earth by environmental
imperialism," the statement read.
<P>
Makah tribal officials could not be reached for 
comment Thursday.
<P>
Last month a three-member panel of the 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in San
Francisco ruled that the federal government's 
environmental studies on Makah
hunts were inadequate and had to be redone.
<P>
LaDuke "is aware of the legal status" brought by 
the court ruling, Demain
said, and she wants the tribe to wait until the 
case is resolved.
<P>Makah whaling families hunted a total of 10 days 
this spring, but did not
kill a whale.
