With quaint fishing villages 
dotting its shores and farming 
still one of its mainstays, the pastoral landscape of Prince Edward 
Island  seems an unlikely place to 
encounter one of the most modern creatures on earth. Yet it is in 
the tanks at Aqua Bounty Farms 
on the island off New Brunswick, 
Canada, that hundreds of truly 
novel fish swim: schools of genetically engineered salmon that 
await approval for sale in the 
United States.

<p> These fish look like Atlantic 
salmon found in groceries around 
the world, but for their age they 
are enormous. Endowed with  foreign genes that produce growth 
hormones, they grow to market 
size -- about seven pounds -- in 
18 months, twice as fast as normal salmon.

<p> Experts on  the biotechnology 
industry  predict that these fish 
will be the first genetically modified animal to make it onto American dinner plates, alongside genetically engineered vegetables 
like corn and potatoes, which 
have been available for several 
years.

<p> Elliot Entis, president of A/F 
Protein Inc., the biotech company 
that owns Aqua Bounty Farms, 
said that the company  already 
had orders for 15 million eggs and 
would  be ready to ship them next 
year, should they receive federal 
approval. Approval is also being 
sought to sell the fish in Canada.

<p> A menagerie of other genetically modified  animals is in the 
works, promising what biotech 
backers say will be advantages 
like cheaper and more nutritious 
food. Borrowing genes from various creatures and implanting 
them in others, scientists are creating fast-growing trout and catfish, oysters that can withstand 
viruses, and an "Enviropig," 
 whose feces are less harmful to 
the environment because they 
contain less phosphorus.   
<p>

<p> Scientists are also developing a 
pig that makes a leaner pork 
chop, one of the first genetically 
modified animals that would offer direct benefits to consumers 
and something biotech advocates 
hope will make  the marketing of 
genetically modified foods easier.

<p> Mr. Entis and colleagues describe their fast-growing fish as 
part of a blue revolution in aquaculture that could feed more people more efficiently and more 
cheaply. 

<p>  But critics and even some Clinton administration officials say 
that genetically engineered creatures are threatening to slip 
through a net of federal regulations that has surprisingly large 
holes.

<p>While food safety issues should 
be addressed, some scientists 
say, the bigger concern is the 
environmental threats posed by 
genetically modified  animals like 
the salmon. For example, a recent study showed that populations of wild fish could, in theory, 
be wiped out by mating with certain kinds of genetically engineered fish, should they escape.
 In addition, there is the possibility of unpredictable environmental disruptions, like those 
that occur when non-native species invade ecosystems, as the 
zebra mussels have the Hudson 
River.

<p>     Yet United States regulators 
interviewed could not point to any federal 
laws specifically governing the use or release of  genetically engineered animals.

<p>  "This is a very big hole," said Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that has been 
highly critical of the biotech industry and 
the federal  regulators. "There's nothing 
clearly on the books. There are no regulations about what you can and can't do."
<p>Instead, federal agencies seeking  to regulate genetically engineered organisms are 
stretching regulations written for other purposes to what critics describe as surprising 
lengths. 

<p> So far, for example, only the Food and 
Drug Administration appears to have any 
authority over the new salmon, which the 
agency claimed by designating the fish's 
foreign genes and the growth hormone they 
produce as a drug for animals.   
<p> The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture, the two other agencies 
overseeing genetically modified  organisms, 
have bowed out of the salmon case, a decision that many  with an interest in the issue 
regret. The F.D.A. is likely to be rigorous in 
examining food safety, these critics say, but 
the agency is less experienced in reviewing 
environmental risks.

<p> "The F.D.A. is not qualified to evaluate 
the ecological risks of engineered fish," said 
Dr. Jane Rissler, senior staff scientist at the 
Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog 
group that is a longtime critic of biotech 
regulation. "We should be concerned that 
the environment will be at risk."

<p>John Matheson, senior regulatory review 
scientist at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, defended the agency's ability to conduct environmental reviews, saying that it  routinely 
investigates the environmental impact of 
new drugs.

<p>"We look at the environmental impacts of 
approving an antibiotic, how much is released into the environment, what does it 
do," Mr. Matheson said. "I don't have any 
more discomfort about this than reviewing 
other animal drugs for environmental impacts."

<p> Yet other administration officials said 
increasing concern over the handling of 
ecological risks by the three federal agencies that monitor biotech organisms had 
prompted consideration of a review of the 
current regulatory framework. 

<p> "We need a system that lets us check 
things beforehand, that shifts the burden of 
proof onto those that would introduce 
them," said Dr. William Brown, science 
adviser to the secretary of the Department 
of the Interior. "I don't think the potential 
impacts on nature have been thought 
through as well as they should be."

<b>Agency Cites Low 
Levels of Growth Hormone</b>


<P>Dr. Choy Hew and Dr. Garth Fletcher 
were among the first researchers to genetically engineer fish when they inserted two 
foreign genes into Atlantic salmon in 1989. 
One gene, taken from a chinook salmon, 
produces growth hormone. A second gene, 
taken from an ocean pout, a distant relative 
of salmon, functions to keep the first gene 
constantly producing its hormone.

<p> Finally, last year, after a decade of genetic 
tinkering, researchers had a reliable breeding stock of salmon that could grow up to six 
times faster than normal. 

<p> Company officials are quick to point out 
that the new fish produces no more growth 
hormone than normal salmon. The reason 
the fish grows faster, Dr. Fletcher said, is 
that the fish produces the hormone year-round, unlike normal salmon,  which produce 
it only in warm-weather months.

<p> In fact, levels of growth hormone in the 
fish are so low, Mr. Matheson said, that the 
Food and Drug Administration will not require one particular set of tests --  feeding 
the salmon to  rodents --  that are typical for 
new drugs for animals.   
<p>

<p> "You can't choke rats with enough salmon 
to cause an effect other than choking," he 
said. Some scientists not involved with the 
company also pointed out that fish growth 
hormone was  unlikely to have an effect on 
humans.

<p> The salmon do not even grow to be unusually large, Dr. Fletcher said, as even 7-year-old salmon at AquAdvantage have never 
weighed more than 17 pounds, large but far 
from record-breaking for the species.

<p>  Mr. Entis also said that the new fish taste 
just like other  salmon grown on  farms. 

<p> Some scientists not involved with the company also played down food safety concerns 
but said it would be important to know, for 
example, if the foreign growth hormone triggered increased production of other compounds, like  insulinlike growth factors. Mr. 
Entis of A/F Protein said the company had 
been asked to look into that question and 
others as part of the continuing  Food and 
Drug Administration review.
<p><b><font size=-1 color=#ag0000>ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY</font></b><br>
<b>Studies Are Done on Hypothetical Situations</b>


<p> 

<P>Salmon are typically grown in enclosures 
in the sea, known as net pens, renowned for 
being torn by waves or hungry wild animals. 
Fish routinely escape, sometimes by the tens 
of thousands.   
<p>If the genetically engineered, 
or transgenic fish,  are grown in such pens, 
some will eventually slip out into the wild, 
some researchers say.

<p> If they do, wild fish could be potentially 
devastated, according to a study published in 
the journal Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences in November by Dr. 
William Muir, a population geneticist, and 
Dr. Richard Howard, an aquatic ecologist, 
both at Purdue University. 

<p> The two researchers studied mating and 
survivorship in normal and genetically engineered versions of a fish known as a medaka. 
Using this information, researchers developed a computer model simulating the escape of a genetically modified  fish into the 
wild. The study showed that if wild females 
preferred  to mate with genetically engineered males and if those matings produced 
offspring that did not survive well, wild populations could be wiped out,  a result they 
called the Trojan gene effect.

<p> Those, of course, are a couple of big ifs -- 
no studies have shown whether any fish 
could create the Trojan gene effect in the 
real world. But there is evidence of its potential. In many species of fish, females prefer 
larger males as mates, setting the scene for 
an advantage for growth-enhanced fish. 

<p>      In addition, Dr. Muir said the genetically 
engineered fish he is now studying, the tilapia, could  be three times larger than normal 
tilapia at sexual maturity, providing a possible mating advantage. In addition, in some 
new fish, including the medaka and coho 
salmon endowed with foreign growth hormone genes, rapid growth can be harmful, 
lowering the fish's survival rate. 

<p> Whether all these pieces would come into 
play in the wild, in the AquAdvantage fish or 
any other, remains to be seen. But even the 
possibility has jolted some researchers.

<p> "It really surprised me," said Dr. Muir, 
who has been developing transgenic fish that 
he hopes to sell. "I went into this thinking 
that transgenics are not a risk."

<p> Dr. Muir said that while in theory the 
Trojan gene effect could occur with traditionally bred salmon as well, he believed it 
was essentially impossible. Traditional 
breeding tends to result in incremental 
changes, not the kind of rapid growth that 
produces radically different  size fish or that 
causes physiological disruptions that are 
likely to alter a fish's survivorship.

<p>At A/F Protein, Mr. Entis said that he and 
colleagues did not believe their AquAdvantage salmon  could cause a Trojan gene effect. "We don't think that they are bigger," 
he said.   
<p>"They don't seem any bigger." 

<p> But  he acknowledged that the company 
had not done the critical experiments to 
determine whether the fish were larger at 
sexual maturity or had a mating advantage.
<p>
he power of genetic engineering  is providing scientists with the ability to create 
animals that confound the imagination.

<p> The most striking of the new creatures 
being concocted by plucking a gene from 
one organism and inserting it into the DNA 
of another are what are known as pharm 
animals. These domesticated beasts -- 
cows, pigs, goats, sheep and chickens -- 
 have been given the ability to produce pharmaceuticals and other valuable substances 
in their milk, eggs or semen. 

<p> Endowed by scientists with foreign genes, 
often taken from humans, these animals, or 
bioreactors, as they are also known, earn 
their keep as living chemical factories. 

<p> Two companies, the Genzyme Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., and PPL Therapeutics, a Scottish company, already have 
products from pharm animals  being tested 
in clinical trials  supervised by  the Food and 
Drug Administration.

<p> Many other animals are still in the development stage. For example, Nexia Biotechnologies in Canada is working on a goat that 
carries a gene from spiders allowing it to 
produce spider silk in its milk. When the 
spider silk, which consists of extremely 
strong, light proteins, is extracted from the 
goat's milk, the substance, potentially, can 
be used in  applications  like bulletproof 
vests.   
<p>  

<p> Scientific competition is fierce. Some 
compounds of interest, like the human blood 
protein erythropoietin, which has not yet 
been produced by a pharm animal, command prices of more than  $15 million  an 
ounce.

<p> "There is no limit to what can be done," 
said Dr. Francois Pothier, reproductive biologist at the University of Laval in Canada, 
who is working on a pig that is genetically 
engineered to produce a drug. Dr. Pothier 
declined to name the substance.   
<p>But because research required to create these 
animals can take years, the drugs they 
produce, he said, have  to be "very interesting and very expensive." Dr. Pothier said 
his pigs would  produce a drug in their 
 semen, which the pigs could  be trained to 
donate regularly in voluminous quantities. 

<p>    Dr. Ann Gibbins, molecular geneticist at 
the University of Guelph, in Canada,  and her 
team are trying to create chickens that 
make antibiotics in their eggs. 

<p> Researchers say pharm animals are the 
only way to produce some of the more 
complex proteins needed for use as drugs. 
Some very simple proteins, like insulin, can 
be churned out by genetically modified bacteria. But some proteins require being folded in particular ways or having sugars 
added before they can be used. Bacterial 
cells cannot carry out these  advanced tasks 
but animal cells can,  making pharm animals the producers   of choice.

<p> Pharm animals are also of interest because some therapeutic proteins otherwise 
have to be collected from blood donated by 
people,  which can be tainted by viruses. 

<p> Because they are domesticated and are so 
valuable, pharm animals are extremely unlikely to escape  or pose any environmental 
threat. But they may still pose risks. Animal 
tissues and fluids can contain other disease-causing contaminants, like prions, a  poorly 
understood class of molecules associated 
with maladies including mad cow disease. 

<p> In addition, while animal rights groups 
have remained relatively quiet on the issue 
of genetically engineered animals, some say 
that the use of animals as living factories 
raises troubling ethical issues.   
<p>

<p> There are also food safety issues.

<p> "Those goats are not going to just get a 
decent burial after they grow old and stop 
producing silk," said John Matheson, senior 
regulatory review scientist at the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug 
Administration, "so we have to look at them 
as potential food and as potential feed ingredients." 

<p> In fact, Mr. Matheson said some genetically engineered animals had already been 
approved for use in animal feeds. He said he 
was unable to disclose what kinds of animals had been approved for such use or 
what animals they might be fed to as these 
genetically engineered animals are still experimental and under confidential review 
within the Food and Drug Administration. 

<p> But  to prevent the spread of prion-associated maladies, Mr. Matheson said, cows 
would not be given feed made from cows, 
genetically engineered or not. Noting that 
animal feed often contains ingredients like 
 rotting animals killed on highways and 
parts of  slaughtered animals,  Mr. Matheson 
said, "Transgenics should be the least of 
your worries, frankly."

<p> Mr. Entis said the Food and Drug Administration had not specified what studies, if 
any, would  be required that directly addressed  such ecological risks. So far the 
company has done none.

<p> "Lord knows we can't promise total safety 
for anything," Mr. Entis said.   
<p>But, he said, 
"We believe that our fish are poor survivors 
out there to start with." Normal fish do not 
produce growth hormone in the winter, presumably because it is disadvantageous to do 
so. Mr. Entis reasoned that since AquAdvantage fish produce the hormone year-round, 
they would not last long enough in the wild to 
do any harm.

<p>  Dr. Anne Kapuscinski, a fish geneticist at 
the University of Minnesota who has studied 
potential impacts of the release of genetically engineered fish, said, "Belief is a great 
thing, but what we need is some risk assessment research."

<p>Similar arguments were once made with 
traditionally bred or normal salmon raised 
on farms, which were said to be too pampered to survive in the wild. But escapees 
have since been found thriving and spawning 
in the same streams as wild salmon.   
<p>In fact, 
environmental groups have long been concerned that salmon from farms might genetically pollute wild salmon or carry diseases into the wild. But little research has 
been done and it is still unclear what role, if 
any, these escapees are playing in the decline 
of wild salmon stocks.

<p> As for the new genetically engineered 
salmon, the Trojan gene effect is only one 
possibility should the fish escape. The new 
fish could also breed with wild fish, genetically polluting dwindling native stocks of Atlantic salmon. 

<p> In response to concerns, Mr. Entis has said 
the company would only sell fish that have 
been rendered sterile for use in net pens. 
Then even if the fish do escape, they cannot 
breed with wild salmon.   
<p>
 A/F Protein employs a standard technique 
for sterilization  that  Mr. Entis described as 
"100 percent effective." But scientists outside the company said that in other laboratories the technique often left some eggs fertile. 

<p> In addition, some researchers pointed out 
that even sterile fish could cause problems 
by competing with native salmon or otherwise disrupting ecosystems.   
<p> 

<p> 
<b><font size=-1 color=#ag0000>THE REGULATORS</font></b><br>
<b>Marine Agency on the Sidelines</b>


<P>If the three agencies  that have so far 
overseen the approval of genetically engineered organisms, only the the Food and 
Drug Administration  has sought to regulate 
the new fish.   
<p>  Mr. Matheson said the agency 
had decided to  regulate the new salmon as a 
drug for animals   after extensive discussions 
at all levels at the agency. 

<p> Mr. Matheson said it had  not been an 
option to review the fish as a food since the 
agency did not require approval of new foods 
before they  entered the marketplace. Because the growth hormone is not used to 
alter the quality of the salmon as food, he 
said, it could not be regulated as a food 
additive either. Instead, the hormone is used 
to change the growth of the animal itself, 
which qualifies it as an animal drug. In its 
review of this and other animal drugs, the 
agency  examines human food safety, animal 
welfare and environmental issues.

<p> While Mr. Matheson defended the decision, 
some scientists said  the handling of the new 
salmon put  a spotlight on the holes in regulation.

<p> "This kind of stretching of the law places 
the emphasis on the wrong things," said Dr. 
Kapuscinski of the University of Minnesota, 
"Plus, it's ludicrous." She urged "a serious 
revisiting" of the regulation now in place.

<p> So far the Food and Drug Administration 
has not outlined any explicit policy or process for regulating genetically engineered 
fish.

<p>  Critics point out that because the salmon is 
being regulated as a drug for animals, it is 
covered by confidentiality laws that prevent 
officials from discussing the review without 
permission from A/F Protein. As a result, 
there remain many unanswered questions 
about what steps will and will not be taken to 
ensure environmental safety.   
<p>

<p> An additional problem, critics say, is that 
the Food and Drug Administration is reviewing environmental risks under the National 
Environmental Policy Act,  which requires 
only that an environmental assessment be 
done.   
<p>Even if the fish should be  found to be 
environmentally damaging, it can still be 
released. 

<p> Noting that the Food and Drug Administration's food safety review is continuing, 
 Mr. Matheson said the agency was keeping 
all its options open, still considering whether 
A/F Protein would be allowed to sell fertile 
fish or only sterile fish and whether farmers 
would be allowed to grow the fish in net pens 
or only in tanks on land. 

<p>  He said the agency would  consult with 
other agencies in making its decision. But  the 
agencies typically in charge of fish have yet 
to get involved, and it remains unclear what 
role they will play.

<p> Dr. Brown, the science adviser to the Interior Department secretary,    said the department  might possess the authority to regulate 
genetically engineered animals under statutes for controlling injurious wildlife and 
aquatic nuisances.   
<p> If existing authorities 
should be insufficient, he added, "Congress 
might need to get involved."

<p> In an interview in March, Edwin Rhodes, 
aquaculture coordinator for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said he was surprised 
to hear that the Food and Drug Administration was overseeing the environmental review regarding the new salmon and making 
decisions on such things as whether fish 
would be grown in net pens. Mr. Rhodes said 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, not 
the Food and Drug Administration,  had the 
expertise to make such decisions, and it 
would need to be involved. 

<p> "We have to have absolute certainty that 
transgenic fish do not interact with wild 
stocks," Mr. Rhodes  said. 

<p> It remains unclear what role the  fisheries 
service will play.

<p> Dr. Eric Hallerman, fisheries geneticist at 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, likened the situation with fish to that 
of genetically engineered  plants in the early 
1990's when the first crops were being 
pushed toward commercial use. 

<p> "Environmental safety assessments 
should be done before these fish are stocked 
out on an industrial scale," Dr. Hallerman 
said. "It's time we got our policies together." 



<p> 
<b><font size=-1 color=#ag0000>THE CONSUMERS</font></b><br>
<b>Salmon Producers Eyeing Competitors</b>


<P>Anti-biotech organizations  around the 
world are already up in arms over the  possible dangers to  the food supply and   the environment from genetically modified plants, 
like corn that produces its own pesticide,  and 
the use of a growth hormone in cows. Public 
concerns over the new crops have even 
caused a few prominent companies to ban 
their use. 

<p> In Scotland and New Zealand, efforts to 
develop other salmon using the foreign genes 
developed by A/F Protein have been  abandoned amid cries of "Frankenfish."

<p> Likewise, many salmon farming groups, 
motivated by a fear of consumer rejection, 
have already declared that they will not use 
genetically engineered fish,  whether governments approve them or not. So far, none 
have.

<p> The International Salmon Farmers Association, which represents the vast majority 
of salmon farmers worldwide, has taken a 
strong stand against the new fish. 

<p> "Genetically engineered salmon is a solution looking for a problem," said Joseph 
McGonigle, executive director of the Maine 
Aquaculture Association. "Virtually everyone in the world has taken a position against 
them."

<p> But while salmon farmers deny any interest, Mr. Entis said, "There's not a salmon 
company in the world that hasn't talked to us 
privately."

<p> As adamantly against the new fish as 
anyone, Odd Grydeland, a salmon farmer in 
British Columbia,  said, "If the rest of the 
world's salmon farming industry moved to 
adopt this type of technology and we were 
left behind, obviously we'd have to reconsider our position."

<p> Scientists say genetically modified carp 
may  already be in commercial use in China 
and genetically engineered tilapia may  be in 
use in Cuba.

<p> "There's going to be more," Dr. Kapuscinski said. "These fish are just the beginning."
