<i>Upon Being Honored by<br>
Southern California Americans for Democratic Action<br>
at the Eleanor Roosevelt Annual Awards Dinner<br>
Beverly Hilton Hotel<br>
September 29, 1999</i></font><br>
<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="3">Thank you, Norman, not only for your kind words about me,
but for your contribution to political discourse with People for the American
Way and for your unique work in film and television, all of which have won
you the President's National Medal of the Arts Award earlier today at the
White House. So thank you for jumping on a plane and whipping back to Los
Angeles to present this award to me.</font></FONT></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lila, I want to thank you and the Americans for Democratic
Action for honoring me.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of your founders, I've already been greatly honored with
the friendship of Hubert Humphrey and Arthur Schlessinger, Jr. I've revered
the late Walter Reuther as I do Mr. Galbraith. But the woman, other than
my mother, I always admired most in my childhood, Eleanor Roosevelt, I never
got to meet. Although had I been a little less wary one day in New York
in 1961, it's possible I would have. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My first movie had just come out, I was walking up Fifth
Avenue, a boy from Virginia unused to being recognized, when out of nowhere
there burst a rather frazzled, hyperactive, overly intense man in his 20s
who yanked me by the arm, and with what seemed to me a crazy glint in his
eye, whispered, &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt wants me to talk to you. I'm going
over to see her now. Come on, you want to see Mrs. Roosevelt.......&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said, &quot;Oh sure, thank you, thank you, I'd love to
see Mrs. Roosevelt but I'm a little late for a... I have a; uh; a thing.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now he grabs both of my sleeves, sweat streaming down his
face, and said, &quot;No, no, Mrs. Roosevelt is a friend of mine. She says
you should do my book. She's a friend of mine.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said, &quot;Well, I think that it's very nice that Mrs.
Roosevelt is a friend of yours. Say hello for me. But if you don't mind,
would you let go of my sleeves?&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And as I pulled away from him, he shoved a book in my hands
and said, &quot;Read it. Read it.&quot; </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As soon as I got a safe distance up Fifth Avenue from him,
I slowed down and opened the book. It was called &quot;Brutal Mandate&quot;
and sure enough there was a blurb on the inside cover by Mrs. Roosevelt.
</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The guy who had stopped me was the late Al Lowenstein,
later to become a Congressman and the president of your organization and
a good friend of mine. You remember him well, I know, and with great affection.
Al had the ability to lead. He was the person most responsible for beginning
the movement protesting President Johnson's policy in Vietnam. There was
no more effective organizer of dissent than Al. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For those of us who shared in that activism, there is a
lot to be proud of. Insofar as it changed our policy in Vietnam, it was
a success.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we didn't succeed in doing, sadly, was to get a fair
shake for the domestic policies of Lyndon Johnson because the country couldn't
afford to pay for those good programs and that bad war at the same time.
</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cost of the war in Vietnam brought into question the
cost of food stamps at home. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You could say it was the cost of that war that causes most
present day liberal politicians to identify themselves as progressives.
But my faith in the basic aspirations of the domestic programs of Lyndon
Johnson, and before him Kennedy, Stevenson, Truman and Roosevelt, just won't
permit me to accept your Eleanor Roosevelt Award as anything other than
an old time, unrepentant, unreconstructed, tax-and-spend, bleeding heart,
die-hard liberal Democrat. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe in the value of social programs, a safety net,
regulation, and an active government.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have no problem professing this because I love my day
job -- making movies. I want to keep making them. I have the great luxury
of not having a career as a politician and I can still say what I want to
say. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As an old friend of mine once said to me, &quot;The greatest
gift God can give a man is to enjoy the sound of his own voice. And the
second greatest gift is to get somebody to listen to it.&quot; And for that
tonight I humbly thank you.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So my happily calling myself a liberal and dissenting from
the centrist approach of the current candidates for the Democratic nomination
for President requires no particular bravery. I have so much less to lose.
</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have no campaign consultant. No pollsters. I have no
reason to placate the DLC (sometimes called the Democratic Leisure Class,
sometimes the Defense Lobby Corporation) or the DNC or any source of campaign
money that so dominates the lives of career public servants today. I happen
to be married to the most breathtaking woman on the planet, have three kids
and a fourth on the way, and I can continue what one right wing columnist
suggested: &quot;The improbable pursuit of acting in movies with leading
ladies half my age.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of improbability, six weeks ago, several of the
grand mentioners of the media began to mention me as what most people of
sound mind would call a &quot;highly improbable candidate for the Democratic
nomination for President.&quot; I responded only that &quot;that seemed
extremely unlikely. It's not that I don't have things to say, but there
must be somebody better than me.&quot; Having said nothing publicly since
(I've been on a listening tour of my house for those six weeks), tonight
seems not a moment too soon to speak up.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The present Administration deserves a lot of sympathy for
having to cope with ruthless Republican Congresses. But in what Paul Wellstone
calls the Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party, when we hear the record
of the political bargains of the past 7 years cosmeticized and spun back
to the public as &quot;progress&quot;, we have to object.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After Theodore Roosevelt, progress in this century has
always been made by Democrats -- but by Democrats who were fighting to the
end for what they believed in, not settling for what they could get. By
changing public opinion polls, not following them. By spending popularity,
not hoarding it. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The big advances -- Social Security, the welfare safety
net, the minimum wage, the Marshall Plan, Civil Rights, voting rights, Medicare,
Medicaid, food stamps, federal aid to education, the war on poverty, Head
Start, job training -- have all been made by Democrats who wouldn't give
up the fight. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surely, the admirable, honest, centrist Vice President
knows that if the objective in the present Administration has been to honor
the historic mission of his party, it hasn't been really fought for let
alone achieved. But he is a loyal friend. Clearly, there are very few people
of such high character or loyalty as the Vice President. Having a Gore Administration
would give him the opportunity to show that loyalty to the more than 100
million Americans left behind in the economic expansion.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Bradley, a man of equally high character, also by
his voting record a centrist, is the only announced challenger. But if we
imagine his Administration, what is this insurgency of a centrist against
a centrist all about? If this is about differences in personality, is it
justified? If it's about real differences on issues, we haven't heard them
yet. Or are we left to decipher the slight differences in the middle of
the road voting records of their mutual pasts or continue to wait and do
nothing and hope the contest will be settled on grounds more substantial
than a macarena contest or a game of one-on-one?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although I think ethanol subsidies are goofy, and playing
around with vouchers is dangerous for public education, and of course we
ought to recognize Cuba; none of which he thinks -- in the past few weeks
Bill Bradley has made some statements which, while not bursting with specificity,
hint at progressive sentiments and I hope that whatever it is that's motivating
those hints will encourage other Progressives to speak up and move him more
specifically in a liberal direction.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But how can we not have heard from either Democratic candidate
a serious objection to the hypocrisy of the Democratic party proudly advertising
our economic expansion as a &quot;boom of unparalleled prosperity for the
nation&quot; when 60% of our people are doing no better in 1999 than they
were doing in 1989? </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can we gloat about prosperity when the poverty level
hasn't changed at all?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or when child poverty is four times that of Western Europe?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And extreme child poverty has gone up 26% in the past year?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in the richest city in the country, outside the doors
of this hotel, one out of three children lives in poverty, and homicide
is still the largest single cause of death for children under 18?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And according to the officials of 30 other major cities,
&quot;The strong economy has had very little positive impact on hunger and
homelessness&quot;?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the poorest fifth of families headed by a single woman
lost $577 a year in income and benefits between '95 and '97?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there were 56% more layoffs in '98 than in the year
before?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A study of 4 Northwestern states shows half of the available
jobs don't pay a livable wage, while the pay of the average corporate chief
executive officer has gone from 42 times to 419 times as much as the worker?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor is
higher than ever, and the poorest fifth of Americans have less than they
had in 1977 and the richest have 43% more?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The richest 2,700,000 Americans have the same amount of
wealth as the poorest 100 million?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do we have a party that quietly shoves this stuff under
the rug and says -- quote -- &quot;most things are going right for America&quot;
-- unquote? </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or is this still the party that your founder Hubert Humphrey
said has as its mission &quot;to take care of those in the dawn of life
and in the shadows of life and in the twilight of life&quot;? What would
Hubert Humphrey say today? Is there no protest anymore?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have we come to the point where the Democratic Party needs
to have a Republican President before it finds its voice again? &quot;A
rising tide&quot; isn't &quot;lifting all boats.&quot; If the Democratic
Party doesn't raise its voice about it, who will?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The media loses interest. In the fall of '88, the New York
Times ran 50 stories on the homeless, 5 of them on the front page. In '98,
with no fewer homeless, it ran 10 pieces in the same period, none of them
on the front page. Without hearing liberal Democrats, you won't hear about
these unrepresented people. You'll hear about the unprecedented prosperity
of globalization.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why? Because these unrepresented people make no campaign
contributions. 96% of the people in America make no campaign contributions.
Every penny of financing for the selection of every candidate for every
public office in America from dog catcher to President is supplied by 4%
of the people. They're mainly rich and they are represented. The $50,000,000.00
raised so far to select Governor Bush as the Republican nominee has come
from three-one-hundredths of 1% of the people.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's why less than half of the people vote. They feel
they have nothing to do with the process of selecting the candidates, and
they're right. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The candidates who are elected for public service aren't
financed by public money. They're selected by private money. From people
who usually want some kind of return on their investment. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary cancer in this sick system, the big money in
politics, has so metastasized into every area of government that we can't
afford any longer to ignore that the life of the patient -- American Democracy
-- is in mortal danger of dying on the table. </font></P>
<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting the money to win makes decent politicians do indecent
things. But in fact, billion dollar subsidies and tax breaks, the pork barrel
and corporate welfare, are only the smaller tumors. There are bigger ones.
</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our taxpayers are bailing out thieves in Mexico, Russia,
Indonesia and other countries and at the same time bailing out major American
financial houses who refuse to face the consequences of their bad investments
overseas. Our government is reacting to this crisis by crisis when we should
be helping to construct a new set of international ground rules to curb
speculation and financial abuse. But our major financial houses want the
freedom to move their money anywhere they please and to be as free of rules
and risk as they can. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The genius of America is the successful harnessing of the
dynamic creativity of the private sector for the public good. No sensible
person wants to dampen that.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But our government is susceptible to a corporate economic
globalization that is not free trade but corporate managed trade. And the
global economy is not working yet for most people. But Pat Buchanan is wrong.
We can't build a wall or turn our back on it. We have to work with it. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem in this new economy is the undue influence
these institutions and corporations have over government actions. They set
the rules. Others aren't invited to the table. What we are in danger of
experiencing is a slow motion coup d'etat of big money's interests over
the public interest. So the global rules, written into trade agreements
like NAFTA and enforced by institutions like the World Trade Organization,
protect things like patents and intellectual property rights but not labor
rights, profits but not people, investments but not the environment. We
know the results -- growth, increasing trade, some development, some people
making lots of money. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 475 billionaires have as much wealth as half the people
on earth. We have the sweatshop again. Child labor. Slave labor. Destruction
of forests, fish, water and air. And so far we haven't heard a word of requirements
on labor and environment and product safety in the agreement being negotiated
over Chinese admission to the World Trade Organization.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course our stocks have gone up. But we're making the
world safe for globalization rather than making globalization safe for the
world.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we don't act to do something about this and make the
world economy work for everybody, we're going to see a reaction that will
make Pat Buchanan look like a choir boy. Which I'm told he once was. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why aren't the Democratic candidates addressing this? They
offer their devotion to globalization as if these markets were made by God
rather than investors.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why? Could it possibly be the leading candidates in both
parties are, by definition, those who have raised the most money from these
same sources? We don't need a third party. We need a second party. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what has happened to the labor movement? What would
Walter Reuther say today? Is there no protest anymore?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have another tumor:</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Health care is a basic human right. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it's the responsibility of the federal government to
guarantee that human right for everybody. The only two governments in the
developed world that don't guarantee it are the government of South Africa
and the government of the United States.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think the best way ever proposed for accomplishing health
care in this country was the Health Security Act S3 -- drawn up by Walter
Reuther and Ted Kennedy, among others. It was a single payer system that
gave everyone access to care and had quality standards for the practice
of medicine. And because it had only one payer, it made it cost less. That
bill was buried over and over again in the 70's by the insurance industry,
the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry. They spent
whatever it took to keep it from coming out of Committee. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the same group had opposed Medicare in the past,
old people study the issues and get out and vote. So Medicare passed. Poor
people, minorities and children don't vote. So the big money was able to
kill the Health Security Act and every other proposal ever made to guarantee
this basic human right.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now does anybody in either party advocate the repeal of
Medicare? Of course not. It's a single payer system. It costs the government
much much less to do the same thing as the insurance companies do. And it
works. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A little while ago we heard the Vice President make some
incremental proposals regarding child health care that were good. And yesterday,
Bill Bradley offered a thoughtful plan for universal health care that the
insurance industry should be very happy with. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the next President of the United States should call
a special session of Congress and, no matter how much the insurance and
pharmaceutical industries spend to make him unpopular, do everything he
can to not let that Congress go home until every American has health care.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does anyone doubt the role of campaign contributors in
keeping the defense budget as high as it is? Or trying to privatize Social
Security? Or stifling gun control? Or hampering environmental protection?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does anyone doubt that campaign contributions help buy
subsidies for nuclear, coal and oil while solar and wind energy go pretty
much unattended or that campaign contributions set ridiculously underpriced
fees for private grazing, mining and lumbering on public lands, or cause
the 70 to 80 billion dollar digital spectrum to be given away to the broadcasters
for nothing in the telecommunications bill that both Democratic candidates
supported? </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Broadcasters are not only among the biggest campaign contributors,
they have the power to decide the candidates you see and for how long you
see them. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a rare man in public office who's got the guts to
go up against the broadcasters. (And it's a rare man in Hollywood who's
got the guts to go up against the broadcasters.)</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A democracy becomes a plutocracy under these conditions.
A state in which the wealthy class rules.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Mr. Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers:</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quote -- &quot;Who are to be the elected leaders of the
Federal representatives? Not the rich more than the poor; not the learned
more than the ignorant, nor the haughty heirs of distinguished names more
than the humble sons of obscure and unpropitious fortune. The electors are
to be the great body of the people of the United States.&quot; unquote.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the complete campaign costs, including primaries, of
the last two cycles of all federal campaigns in '96 and '98 are combined,
it comes to $3,600,000,000.00 for the four years.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With complete public financing, that would cost the public
about $3.50 per person per year. What a small price for the people to pay
for knowing their elected representatives don't owe anything to anybody
but the public and will spend their tax dollars honestly.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's estimated that $1,000 per taxpayer per year is spent
on corporate welfare and pork barrel legislation. Three and a half bucks
is not a lot to help to get rid of it.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost all former members of the Senate and the House are
in favor of public financing of federal campaigns. But this is in sharp
contrast to the immediate interests of the incumbents.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incumbents can raise more money. They have something to
sell in that system. And they have learned how to deal in that system so
they don't want a change in that system. In the last election, 98% of House
and Senate incumbents were re-elected. Senate incumbents raised more than
twice as much as their challengers and House incumbents raised nearly five
times as much.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neither Democratic candidate has advocated complete public
financing, including the primaries, of all federal campaigns. Bill Bradley
would not include the primaries. What's the point without the primaries?
But the public will never have Democracy until it's willing to pay the bill
for it. Aren't we willing to spend three and a half dollars a year to get
our government back?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We're told by the Republican Senator Mitch McConnell that
the public is bored by this subject. In fact, if the public ever focuses
on what's really happening, nothing will agitate them more.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me quote you something from a letter by another Republican;
Abraham Lincoln:</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The money power preys upon the nation in times of
peace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic
than monarchy. More insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy.
I see in the near future, a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes
me to tremble for the safety of my country. Corporations have been enthroned.
An era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will
endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people
until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed.&quot;
End of quote.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If somehow I could reach back in time and bring them into
the present, and Al Lowenstein could take me over to meet Eleanor Roosevelt
today, we could say to her, &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt, the party's drifting.
It's enslaved by big money. It's lost its purpose. You stand for the principles
that will return it to its mission. The people trust your spirit. Please
run for President.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think by now, if she'd experienced the past 20 years,
she might say, &quot;Well, I was beginning to think you'd never ask.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But sadly, only the spirit of Mrs. Roosevelt is alive today.
Hubert Humphrey is gone. Walter Reuther is gone. So is Al Lowenstein.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But their spirit is here.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I can see some hope for that spirit in Al Gore and
Bill Bradley.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if an unexpected person showed that he or she had that
spirit and the ability to lead, and said to me there was no liberal running
for President, no Wellstone, no Jackson, no Kennedy, no Mario Cuomo, and
that serious people of good judgment were talking to that person about running,
if I didn't think they were nuts, it would make no difference to me whether
that person had become well-known as a basketball player, or a businessman,
an actor, a wrestler, a grocery clerk or a drum majorette. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd say to that person: </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Look, Drum Majorette, there's no harm in thinking
about it, however unlikely it might be. But whatever you do, go ahead and
speak up. Speak up for the people nobody speaks for.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if you speak up well, maybe you'll influence some people
and the party and the candidates that are running. And who knows what else?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And remember, Drum Majorette, don't delude yourself into
thinking it's got an awful lot to do with you. It doesn't. It's the time
you're living in. And a temporary vacuum that allows you the privilege of
being heard.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one more thing, Drum Majorette:</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When those plutocrats start with you; when you start hearing
those moneyed honeyed voices of ridicule and reaction;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let them call you coy.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let them call you flirtatious.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But keep talking. Keep that spirit. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep talking. </font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You've got to keep the spirit.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you, A.D.A., for keeping the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep the spirit.</font></p>
