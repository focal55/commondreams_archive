<p>WASHINGTON -- President Bush is banking on Americans to rally behind any decision to invade Iraq and disarm Saddam Hussein, and outside experts say it is likely to happen -- but they also warn it may not last. </p><p>Senior White House aides say they expect traditional rally-around-the-flag sentiment to quiet anti-war protests, quell Democratic criticism and cement domestic backing for what would be the largest, riskiest combat operation since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</p><p>Outside experts agree that Bush will garner support at the outset of any U.S.-led attack on Iraq. But the experts warn that as the Vietnam War showed, public support can dissipate in controversial conflicts that drag on, igniting partisan criticism at home and allied resistance abroad.</p><p>"Rallies are like earthquakes -- you know what causes them but you can't always predict when they'll occur or how long they'll last," says Rice University's Paul Brace, the co-author of "Follow the Leader: Opinion Polls and the Modern Presidents."</p><p>White House officials say Bush will devote part of his State of the Union address Tuesday to preparing the nation for possible military action in Iraq.</p><p>Bush delivers his address amid declining approval ratings, deepening public concern over a war in Iraq and sharp differences between the United States and key allies, led by France and Germany. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey this week showed Bush's approval had slipped from 90 percent immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to 54 percent -- the lowest point since the attacks.</p><p>But White House officials see combat in Iraq sparking a rebound, citing the dramatic surge in public support for President George Bush in 1991 when he ordered forces into combat to evict Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait.</p><p>Barely 47 percent of Americans considered Kuwait worth fighting for before combat began; 71 percent felt that way afterward.</p><p>The elder Bush reaped the second-largest gain in polling history in 1991 with a 25-percentage-point surge to 89 percent during the 43-day Persian Gulf War.</p><p>Presidents have long benefited from the public rallying behind the living symbol of national unity. Navy Cmdr. Stephen Decatur summed up the sentiment in a famous 1816 banquet toast in Norfolk, Va., to celebrate the U.S. triumph over pesky Barbary pirates marauding U.S. shipping from the Mediterranean.</p><p>"Our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations, may she always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong," Decatur said.</p><p>Bush can count on a surge in popularity at the outset of combat operations in Iraq, says Jeffrey Jones of the Gallup polling organization. "We've seen it happen during 60 years of polling so we should be ready for it," he says.</p><p>William Baker, a political scientist at the Arkansas School for Mathematics and Sciences and the co-author of "The Nature and Origins of the Rally 'Round the Flag Effect," says presidential approval has jumped an average of 8 percentage points in major U.S. combat operations over the past 60 years, bolstered by bipartisan support for the chief executive.</p><p>"Rallies tend to be quick and sharply focused," says Baker. "The public does not rally in response to crises in and of themselves but rather to the president's handling and presentation of events."</p><p>Brace says surges of support last only if a president makes a clear case that national interests are at risk and public attention remains focused on the threat. Brace says Bush is encountering difficulty persuading Americans that Saddam poses the kind of threat that warrants military action.</p><p>"The president is trying very, very hard to link Saddam Hussein to weapons of mass destruction, threats to the oil supply and terrorist attacks on the United States," Brace says. "But so far the connection doesn't seem clear and he's facing an uphill battle convincing the country about the threat."</p><p>The prospect of temporary occupation of Iraq following an invasion could confront Bush with trying to maintain public support for a distant operation going into the 2004 re-election campaign.</p><p>Bush could suffer setbacks in his approval rating if U.S. operations bogged down or GIs suffered periodic attacks. "Long-term wars tend to hurt presidential popularity," Baker says.</p><p>Rallies invariably "peter out," says Brace, as the threat recedes and public attention shifts to other issues. "Critics question the merits of the entire intervention, the story dies down and it becomes hard for a president to keep sustained attention on an issue," Brace says.</p><p>Presidents have seen crisis support ebb quickly, setting the stage for the re-election defeat or withdrawal of three presidents since 1968.</p><p>American economic concerns slashed 57 percentage points off the elder Bush's approval rating during the 16 months after the Gulf War, setting the stage for his defeat by then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton in 1992.</p><p>Jimmy Carter reaped a 26 percentage point surge in his approval rating following the seizure of American hostages in Iran by Islamic militants in 1979. But failed diplomatic efforts and a rescue mission gone wrong in 1980 drove Carter's approval back down to where it stood before the crisis, setting the stage for his defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p><p>Lyndon Johnson's approval rating jumped to 70 percent following the Gulf of Tonkin incident off Vietnam in 1964 when North Vietnamese gunboats allegedly opened fire on U.S. warships.</p><p>But the 1968 Tet offensive across South Vietnam vividly illustrated the failure of U.S. military operations to secure South Vietnam against communist forces, driving Johnson's approval rating down to 41 percent and provoking his withdrawal from the race for re-election less than two months later.</p>
