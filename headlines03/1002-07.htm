<p>UNITED NATIONS  - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  Annan questioned on Thursday whether the new U.S.-draft  resolution on Iraq was enough to change attitudes toward the  United Nations and other international bodies in the country.<P>
Trying to win over skeptics, the United States revised a  U.N. Security Council resolution that emphasizes a step-by-step  transfer of power to Iraqis but gives no timetable for the end  of the occupation.<P>
"We are studying it. We will have to determine whether it  is a radical change from the past, or what it is," Annan told  reporters. "Obviously it's not going in the direction I had  recommended but I will still have to study it further."<P>
After the Aug. 19 bombing of U.N. headquarters in Baghdad  that killed 22 people, Annan told council ambassadors he wanted  a new "radical" approach that would make it safe enough for  U.N. staff to return, U.N. officials said. Only about 30  foreign staff out of more than 600 are still in the country.<P>
The new U.S. draft strengthens duties of the United Nations  but does not give the world body an independent role in  overseeing the transition to sovereignty as many wanted.<P>
The main purpose of the new resolution, as in earlier  drafts, is to transform the military operation into a  U.N.-authorized multinational force under American command.<P>
This provision is aimed at attracting more contributions  from nations wary of sending soldiers as part of an occupation  force, although volunteers appear to be scarce.<P>
France had wanted an immediate symbolic handover of  sovereignty to Iraq while Russia has advocated that the United  Nations be given a date to formulate a timetable.<P>
Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergei Lavrov said, "We believe  that at this stage we should give the United Nations the  leading role in the political process, to work with all Iraqis,  to develop a timetable which should be clear, which would be  leading to the full restoration of sovereignty and that this  process could be supported by a multinational force."<P>
"That is the essence of the position and against this  position we would be looking at the American draft," told  reporters.<P>
CHANGING PERCEPTIONS<P>
Annan and other U.N. officials have said that one way to  change perceptions on the ground would be to turn over power to  a provisional Iraq government within three to five months.<P>
"What we want is a sovereign provisional government as soon  as possible so we can work in Iraq like we do in other  countries instead of being asked to be part of military  occupation," one senior U.N. official said, speaking on  condition of anonymity.<P>
The Bush administration wants the resolution adopted before  an Oct. 23-24 donors conference in Madrid on rebuilding Iraq,  which international institutions say will cost more than $35  billion.<P>
No Security Council members has threatened to veto the  resolution but France has said it might abstain.<P>
The 25-member Iraqi Governing Council, appointed by the  United States, would provide a timetable and program for  drafting a new constitution and for elections, in cooperation  with the occupation authorities and the United Nations.<P>
The United Nations would help, if asked by Iraqi leaders,  to establish an electoral process along with "advancing efforts  to restore and establish national and local institutions for  representative government," the draft says.<P>
To meet some objections, the text speaks of the "temporary  nature" of the U.S.-led occupation "until an internationally  recognized, representative government is established."<P>
It says that the administration of Iraq will be  "progressively undertaken by the evolving structures of the  Iraqi interim administration.<P>
"The day when Iraqis govern themselves must come quickly,"  the preamble of the draft says.<P>
U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte presented the draft on  Thursday to the full 15-member Security Council.<P>
In Berlin, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the  resolution was a step in the right direction. But another  senior German official said the document still needed work.
