<p>BAGDHAD --
Something is killing the children in Dr. Emad Wisam's hospital ward, 
and filling it up again and again with more sick and dying kids.
<P>Walking a visitor through the halls of Al Mansour Children's Hospital in 
Baghdad last weekend, Wisam stopped briefly at his small patients' bedsides to 
commiserate.
<P>After checking 5-year-old Nur Abdullah, who has a tumor in his throat, 
Wisam turned away with a pained look in his eyes.
<P>"He will die soon," he said. "Most of these kids will die. And there's 
almost nothing we can do."

</TABLE></font>Iraq has experienced a dramatic increase in child cancers, leukemia and 
birth defects in recent years. Wisam, Iraqi medical authorities and growing 
numbers of American activists cast blame on the U.S. weapons containing 
depleted uranium that were used in the 1991 Gulf War and in the 1998 missile 
attacks on Baghdad and other major cities. They also assert that such 
munitions -- which were also used by U.S. forces in Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia 
in far smaller quantities -- may be a cause of Gulf War diseases, elusive 
maladies that have affected 50,000 to 80,000 U.S. veterans of the 1991 
conflict.
<P>The Pentagon says studies it has sponsored have found no evidence that 
depleted uranium, known as DU, causes serious illnesses, while many 
international medical experts remain on the fence, citing the lack of 
definitive scientific evidence on the issue.
<P>But with the renewed use of DU weapons by the U.S. military considered 
likely in the event of a new war with Iraq, the controversy is being stirred 
up again.
<P>Depleted uranium is the low-level radioactive waste left over from 
manufacturing nuclear fuel and bombs. It is used in bullets and missiles by 
the United States, Britain, Russia and several other nations -- though, from 
all indications, not by Iraq.
<P><b>HIGHLY EFFECTIVE</b>
<P>Military experts regard DU as an almost magically effective material. DU is 
1.7 times denser than lead, and when a weapon made with a DU tip or core 
strikes the side of a tank or bunker, it slices straight through and erupts in 
a burning radioactive cloud. In addition, armor made of DU appears to make 
tanks far less vulnerable on the battlefield.
<P>During the Gulf War, U.S. airplanes and tanks fired off munitions 
containing 320 tons of DU. According to Iraqi health statistics, the country's 
recent increase in health problems has been concentrated in the same areas of 
the country that took the brunt of U.S. attacks: Baghdad, the southern port 
city of Basra, and the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.
<P>No similar problems are known to have occurred in Kuwait, where DU was also 
used, because such weapons were used mainly outside of population centers and 
because Kuwait carried out a comprehensive, well-funded postwar cleanup of 
spent munitions and combat wreckage.
<P>Among children throughout Iraq, the number of cancer cases has risen five-
fold since 1990, and congenital birth defects and leukemia have tripled, say 
government health officials. Overall cancer rates among all Iraqis have risen 
by 38 percent, the Iraqi government says.
<P>"There are thousands of cases of DU poisoning in Iraq by the Americans and 
British," said Health Minister Dr. Omeid Mobarik.
<P><b>FUTURE USE PREDICTED</b>
<P>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that branches of the U.
S. military are looking for alternatives to DU, but officials refuse to say 
publicly whether DU weapons will be used in a new war against Iraq. Defense 
Department spokeswoman Barbara Goodno has acknowledged, "Depleted uranium is 
an important component in the U.S. arsenal."
<P>"Despite being engaged multiple times (during the Gulf War), often at close 
range, by Iraqi tanks and anti-armor weapons," she added, "not a single U.S. 
tank protected by DU armor was penetrated or knocked out by hostile fire."
<P>Experts say the crucial edge that DU technology affords makes it too 
effective to pass up.
<P>"Yes, certainly the U.S. will use it," said John Eldridge, editor of the 
authoritative book Jane's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense.
<P>Christopher Hellman, a senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information 
in Washington, said U.S. and British military planners are likely to be swayed 
more by DU's effectiveness than by possible health concerns.
<P>"Their view is very simple," said Helman. "This is war, and a destroyed 
enemy tank is less dangerous than one that's shooting at you, regardless of 
whatever residual effects DU may have."
<P>Just what those health effects may be, however, is hotly debated.
<P>Pentagon officials deny any links, either to Iraqi civilians or American 
Gulf War veterans. They dismiss Iraq's reports of increases in cancer, birth 
defects and leukemia, saying their pre-1990 baseline figures are unreliable.
<P>They point in particular to a Pentagon-funded review of scientific 
literature on cancer and DU carried out by the Rand Corp. in 1999. It 
concluded that no link had been found. Initial studies by the World Health 
Organization and the European Community also have found no link.
<P>But the Rand report -- which leans heavily on research into the relatively 
mild effects of conventional uranium -- acknowledges that "few studies to date 
. . . have focused directly on DU."
<P>While the Veterans Administration has conducted limited studies of some 
veterans exposed to DU, and found no links so far to serious illness, U.S. 
activists point out that none of the published studies have tested broad 
numbers of sick Americans or Iraqis who have been exposed to DU. The U.S. 
military has conducted several such studies, but they remain classified. The 
Iraqi military refuses all comment on whether its veterans have experienced 
their own Gulf War illnesses.
<P><b>AMERICAN EXPERT</b>
<P>One American with personal experience of DU is Doug Rokke, former director 
of the U.S. Army's Depleted Uranium Project. He was in charge of a team of 
about 100 soldiers who examined and cleaned up Iraqi tanks and American 
vehicles struck by DU shells during the Gulf War.
<P>The work was ghastly -- the DU explosions so badly burned the dead soldiers 
inside that the team dubbed them "crispy critters."
<P>The team's members, uninformed about the danger of DU residue, were 
themselves contaminated. Most have suffered serious health problems in the 
intervening years, and "too many" have died, says Rokke, who says he eschews 
exact numbers because of the difficulty of proving direct links to DU exposure.
<P>Rokke, who has a Ph.D. in physics and until recently was a professor at 
Jacksonville State University in Alabama, says he has "5,000 times the 
recommended level of radiation in my body" and has called the health woes 
among residents of southern Iraq and his own colleagues "the direct result" of 
DU exposure.
<P>In an interview on Saturday, Rokke said of his own health: "I'm trashed." 
He said that Pentagon officials routinely tell him and others who were 
contaminated in the gulf theater that the elevated levels of uranium in their 
bodies are "just coming out of our diets."
<P><b>INTERNATIONAL OPINION</b>
<P>But organizations outside the United States have come down against DU 
munitions:
<P>-- In 1999, the European Parliament voted to urge NATO to suspend the use 
of DU munitions pending results of an independent study. The request was 
ignored.
<P>-- Last August, the U.N. Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights authorized a study of the dangers of DU, which the panel had 
already labeled a weapon of mass destruction. The move -- coming over the 
objections of the United States and Britain -- was a significant victory for 
Karen Parker, a San Francisco lawyer who works with the International 
Educational Development/Humanitarian Law Project and has campaigned against DU 
for years.
<P>-- A 1991 study by Britain's Atomic Energy Authority found that use of DU 
weapons in the Gulf War could eventually lead to half a million "potential 
deaths from cancer." The report was suppressed by the British government until 
1998.
<P>Hard science on the DU issue remains scarce, however.
<P>Richard Clapp, an epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public 
Health and one of the few experts to investigate the DU-cancer relationship, 
is carrying out a study of Gulf War diseases among Massachusetts veterans.
<P>His initial findings suggest increased incidences of Hodgkin's disease in 
Gulf War veterans exposed to DU, but no increases in other types of cancer.
<P>But Clapp cautions that further comprehensive study is needed. In an e-mail 
interview, he wrote: "The potential for a DU-cancer link (especially lung 
cancer in those who breathe DU through dust and smoke particles) is still an 
open question. I certainly would not rule it out on biological grounds, and 
'no proof of harm is not proof of no harm,' as we say."
<P><b>OIL FIRES, CHEMICAL WEAPONS</b>
<P>Iraq's health problems and Americans' Gulf War illnesses could have many 
additional causes besides DU, Clapp and other U.S. experts say. Other possible 
factors include pollution breathed in from the oil fires ignited in Kuwait by 
retreating Iraqi soldiers or from Iraqi chemical weapons stores hit by U.S. 
missiles.
<P>"The reason there is no proof of causality between DU and any particular 
disease is that no one has seriously looked for it," said Steve Leeper, co-
director of the Global Association for Banning DU Weapons, a U.S.-Japanese 
coalition based in Atlanta, Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
<P>"The biggest problem with radiation, especially involving a low-level 
radiation source that is also a toxic chemical, is that it can get you in so 
many ways," said Leeper.
<P>"Which disorder you wind up with depends on where the DU winds up in your 
system and what sort of damage it does to what sort of cells. To really find 
an effect, the government would have to study all the veterans, especially the 
205,000 that have applied for medical help from the Veterans Administration, 
and the people of southern Iraq and test for uranium in their urine, organs 
and bones, then look for correlations with various pathologies."
<P>Dr. Alim Yacoub, a British-educated epidemiologist who is dean of the 
medical school at Mustansiriya University in Baghdad, expressed anger at the 
world's response to the Iraqi health crisis.
<P>"Why have no international studies been carried out?" he asked. "Where is 
the World Health Organization? This issue is highly political and has been 
affected by propaganda, by American pressure."
<P>WHO officials say that in 2001, the U.N. organization proposed to Iraq a 
comprehensive study of all cancer problems, including DU, but received no 
response.
<P><b>U.N. SANCTIONS</b>
<P>Yacoub insists that the project was blocked by the strict U.N. sanctions 
imposed on Iraq since the Gulf War. He said the International Atomic Energy 
Agency has refused to allow Iraq to import radiology equipment needed to carry 
out the research because it is termed "dual use," meaning that it could be 
used to help develop nuclear weapons.
<P>Defense analyst Hellman summed up the standoff over DU by saying, "The 
science on this is not unanimous.
<P>"My approach is: If you can't use it safely, then you shouldn't use it. The 
military's approach is 180 degrees from that. They say, 'If you can't prove it 
isn't safe, we're going to keep using it.' "

<b>ORIGIN, USES, EFFECTS OF DEPLETED URANIUM</b>
Depleted uranium (DU) is a byproduct of the process during which fissionable 
uranium (uranium 235) used to manufacture nuclear bombs and reactor fuel is 
separated from natural uranium, a heavy metal found in soil and water 
everywhere on earth, mainly in trace quantities.
<P>DU (uranium 238) is about 40 percent less radioactive than natural uranium, 
but it remains radioactive for 4.5 billion years. Because it is such a highly 
dense metal -- heavier than lead or steel -- it is prized for its abilities to 
both penetrate military armor and provide shielding against attack.
<P>Upon impact, DU produces extremely fine uranium oxide dust that is both 
chemically toxic and radioactive. Easily spread by wind, it is inhaled and 
absorbed into the human body and absorbed by plants and animals, becoming part 
of the food chain.</p>
