<p>NAJAF, Iraq  - Religious leaders of both Shi'ite  and Sunni Muslims said Friday Iraqis were becoming increasingly  angry at the presence of U.S.-led troops in their country and  one warned holy war could be declared in six months.
<P>
U.S. forces in Iraq are already facing between 10 and 25  attacks a day, according to the general who led the war that  ousted Saddam Hussein.<P>
U.S. Gen. Tommy Franks told U.S. lawmakers Friday American  soldiers had noticed assailants were now using weapons such as  mortars rather than just small arms and grenades.<P>
In the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf, 100 miles south of  Baghdad, a religious leader of Iraq's majority Shi'ite Muslims,  said Shi'ites could turn against U.S.-led forces if they were  not given political compensation after decades of persecution  under Saddam.<P>
"In Iraq, there is a Shi'ite majority but the previous  regime treated it as a minority ... . They must be compensated  for this persecution," Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer Hakim told  Reuters in an interview.<P>
The black-turbaned ayatollah, sitting on cushions on the  floor of his Najaf residence, said more and more Iraqis were  angry over the foreign presence in Iraq.<P>
Shi'ite Muslims, who account for 65 percent of Iraq's 26  million population, largely welcomed the U.S. invasion after  years of persecution under Saddam. But Hakim said they may lose  their patience if Iraqis are not allowed to take over running  the country very soon.<P>
"They gave the justification that they came in the name of  liberation but now they are an occupying force. That is what is  making people angry," he said. "If the people lose their  patience, there will be a social uproar."<P>
SIX MONTHS<P>
A more hard-line message came from a leader of minority  Sunni Muslims in the flashpoint town of Falluja, west of  Baghdad, where some analysts say anti-U.S. attacks began as  revenge for the killings of 15 youthful demonstrators in late  April.<P>
Sheikh Abdullah Janabi, a leader of one of Falluja's 46  mosques, urged people there to give U.S. forces six months to  finish their mission in the town.<P>
"When this period is finished, the patience of Muslims will  run out and jihad (holy struggle) will be declared," he told  worshipers at Friday prayers.<P>
Washington hopes the violence will decline if Iraqis feel  the occupying powers are transferring authority to local  leaders. One key step will be the establishment of a national  governing council, expected within days.<P>
The U.S. administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer, has said  patience is needed to rebuild the shattered country.<P>
U.S. officers denied Arabic media reports that American  soldiers had pulled out of Falluja.<P>
Troops in Falluja pulled out of a police station and the  mayor's office but remained in the town, officers and witnesses  said. U.S. soldiers in armored vehicles patrolled the town  center Friday morning.<P>
Thirty-one U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq since  President Bush declared major combat over on May 1. U.S.  officials blame Saddam loyalists on recent attacks but many  Iraqis say the attacks reflect growing discontent with the  occupation.<P>
MORTAR, GRENADE ATTACKS<P>
Attackers fired four mortar rounds overnight at a U.S. base  in Samarra, around 60 miles north of Baghdad, wounding three  soldiers and an Iraqi, the military said.<P>
Thursday evening, a U.S. patrol came under rocket-propelled  grenade attack northeast of Baghdad airport and the troops  returned fire, a military spokesman said. Two Iraqi civilians  were wounded in the crossfire, he added.<P>
U.S. forces have frequently come under fire on the highway  leading to the airport.<P>
In Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad, attackers fired three  mortar rounds at a U.S. military base at around 4:30 a.m., a  spokesman said. No one was injured. Witnesses said mortar  rounds struck the base again Friday night. There were no  reports of casualties.<P>
Bush and his ally, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, are  facing mounting accusations that they exaggerated the threat of  alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify invading  Iraq. No chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have so far  been found.<P>
Bush and Blair will meet in Washington on July 17, U.S.  officials said Friday.
