<p>DUBAI  - A taped message believed to be from  fugitive militant Osama bin Laden on Tuesday warned Arab  nations against supporting a war against Iraq as threatened by  the United States -- but branded Saddam Hussein an infidel.

Osama bin Laden  is seen in this April 1998 photo. The al-Jazeera Arab satellite station broadcast a new audio statement from bin Laden on Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2003, in which he expresses solidarity with the Iraqi people but labels Saddam Hussein an 'infidel'. A broadcast editor at al-Jazeera said the tape appears to be authentic because the television station got it through the same means as previous bin Laden statements.(AP Photo/file) <br>

</table></font></font>In a broadcast coinciding with a major Muslim festival that  prompted tight security in the United States and Britain to  avert possible attacks, the man blamed for September 11 urged  Muslims to fight America and repel any war against Iraq.
<p>

		"We stress the importance of martyrdom (suicide) attacks  against the enemy. These attacks inflicted on America and  Israel a disaster they have never experienced before," said the  statement, broadcast on the Qatar-based al-Jazeera satellite  television channel.<p>

		Any Arab ruler supporting America or providing logistical  or verbal backing for a war on Iraq would be "an apostate whose  blood should be spilled," it said.<p>

		The broadcast coincided with the start of the three-day  Muslim Eid al-Adha festival marking the end of the annual Haj  -- the pilgrimage to Mecca.<p>

		U.S. officials said the tape was probably genuine, the  strongest evidence so far that bin Laden survived the U.S.-led  war in Afghanistan to drive out the Taliban government and the  al Qaeda network of the Saudi-born militant.<p>

		State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the tape  corroborated the allegations that Secretary of State Colin  Powell made to the U.N. Security Council last week to justify  U.S. threats to go to war against Iraq -- that al Qaeda and the  Iraqis were in contact and cooperating.<p>

		But the statement did not express support for Saddam. It  said Muslims should support the Iraqi people rather than the  country's government.<p>

		Concern that the United States has not made a valid case  for war against Iraq has already divided the NATO Western  alliance, with France, Germany and Belgium refusing to back  preparations to assist fellow-member Turkey in the event of  war.<p>

		A NATO official in Brussels said after two days of deadlock  that efforts to break the impasse in the alliance would  continue through the night, with a meeting of its North  Atlantic Council set for 3:45 a.m. EST on Wednesday.<p>

		While urging Muslims to support the Iraqi people and repel  any attack on their country, the tape said Saddam's secular  "socialist" government had lost credibility.<p>

		"Socialists are infidels wherever they are," the statement  said. But it added: "It does not hurt that in current  circumstances, the interests of Muslims coincide with the  interests of the socialists in the war against crusaders."<p>

</table></font></font>The United States accuses Baghdad of having biological,  chemical and nuclear weapons programs and has said it is  prepared to disarm Iraq by force without further U.N. approval  if necessary. Iraq denies the allegations.<p>

		The broadcast followed testimony to the U.S. Senate  intelligence committee in which CIA director George Tenet said  there had been specific threats of attacks in the next few  days.<p>

		These included targets in the United States or on the  Arabian peninsula using a radioactive "dirty bomb" or poisons,  Tenet said.<p>

		He said information came from several sources with "strong  al Qaeda ties" and the U.S. security alert had been raised to  Orange, its second highest level.<p>

Staunch U.S. ally Britain dramatically stepped up security  at London's major Heathrow airport on Tuesday.
		<p>

		Hundred of troops were drafted in what a police source said  was partly a precaution against an al Qaeda rocket attack on a  plane. Troops were also called to other sites in London. A  police statement said attacks might be linked to Eid al-Adha.<p>

		Serious Western differences over Iraq had already been laid  bare on Monday as France, Germany and Belgium held up military  deployments for NATO member Turkey intended to protect it from  Iraqi retaliation if U.S. troops attack Iraq from Turkish soil.<p>

		They argued, to U.S. annoyance, that to send surveillance  planes, Patriot missiles and anti-chemical and biological  warfare teams to Turkey would be a premature signal that war  had begun and diplomatic efforts had ended.<p>

		France insisted on its solidarity with Turkey but said  Paris had to base its approach on November's U.N. Security  Council Resolution 1441, which sent U.N. arms inspectors back  to Iraq.<p>

		Russia and China have backed the French insistence that  arms inspectors be given more time to investigate Iraq's  alleged banned weapons programs, with war only as a last  resort.<p>

		Russian President Vladimir Putin, visiting Paris, told  French television: "It would be a grave error if unilateral  actions were taken outside the framework of international law."<p>

		The threat of war is already affecting the global economy.<p>

		In Washington, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  the uncertainties posed "formidable barriers" to business  spending and made it hard to gauge the state of the U.S.  economy.<p>

		Germany pushed for a European plan to confront economic  weakness that is threatening to push it into another recession  -- which an Iraq war would exacerbate.<p>

		Oil prices rose to two-year highs after the head of the  world's biggest oil company, Exxon Mobil Corp, said U.S.  strategic reserves should not be used to curb prices.<p>

		<p>

		SADDAM ON TELEVISION<p>

		In Iraq, Saddam was shown on television receiving officials  to mark the Eid al-Adha holiday.<p>

		"I could not wish for a greater, higher or better state  that we are in...of Iraqi men and women and their growing  readiness and ability to confront evil" in attacking Iraq, he  said.<p>

		A personal peace envoy from Pope John Paul arrived in  Baghdad with a message to Saddam "crucial for peace in Iraq"  and was due to meet Iraqi officials on Wednesday.<p>

		The U.S. military said aircraft taking part in U.S.-British  patrols over north and south Iraq attacked and destroyed a  mobile Ababil-100 surface-to-surface missile and support  vehicles. There was no immediate report from Baghdad.
		<p>

		The European Union, which includes many NATO member states,  announced meanwhile that heads of state and government would  gather for a summit on Iraq in Brussels next Monday.
