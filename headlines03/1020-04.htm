<p>The social consciousness ran thick at the <a href="http://www.Bioneers.org/" target="_new">Bioneers environmental 
conference</a> Sunday in Marin County. So thick that when an 8-year-old boy 
realized that the yummy, solar-baked chocolate chip cookie he was eating was 
made with Nestle's pre-made dough, he spit it out.
<P>Kid probably thought it was too corporate, figured the Solar Living 
Institute folks who were running the cooking demonstration. Or contained 
genetically engineered corn products. And surely no organic chocolate. 
<P>"But when that kid did that I said, 'Sit down, kid, you're someone I want 
to hang with,' " said Chris Callor, an intern with the Institute.

  </table></font>Celebrating this group hug of like minds has been a hallmark of the 
annual conferences of biological pioneers  --  the so-called Bioneers  --  in 
Marin County, the spiritual home of the environmental movement, and a comfy 
cradle for many of its offshoots. The common theme is a call to join in a 
search: How can we use nature's own properties to "heal itself"?
<P>Over the past three days, the 3,400 attendees  --  and an equal number 
hooked up in 12 cities internationally via satellite  --  have paid up to $300 
to hear from and share with those on the cutting edge of the environmental 
movement. 
<P>It's a crowd that gave a minute-long standing ovation Sunday to Percy 
Schmeiser, the Canadian farmer who's battling agribusiness giant Monsanto all 
the way to the Canadian Supreme Court and listened intently to the Los Angeles 
ex-gang member who's trying to get his neighborhood to care about asbestos-
riddled buildings.
<P>Although it receives little mainstream publicity, the Bioneers has grown 
from a gathering of "a couple dozen people" 14 years ago in Santa Fe, N.M., 
into this year's international confab that attracts big thinkers and doers 
from science to social justice. This isn't a bunch of theorists and academics, 
said founder Kenny Ausubel, but people who are actually doing something 
practical. While many of the speakers command five-figure paychecks on the 
lecture circuit, they donate their services to Bioneers; the organizers only 
accept donations from "socially-conscious" corporations.
<P>Now, said Ausubel, the challenge is to take the energy and ideas 
generated at Bioneers and make it politically powerful. While he called for a 
"Green New Deal," and other investments in repairing the Earth, he said he 
realizes that most politicians won't react until they see a groundswell from 
below them. "Once people learn that there are practical solutions, it changes 
things," Ausubel said Sunday. 
<P>So whether it was hearing from the president of the Green Builders of 
Marin or the president of New Leaf Paper  --  "the paper with a past and a 
future"  --  attendees swapped stories of Earth-friendly ventures, pilot 
programs and small-scale successes. They were among friends in a crowd where 
nobody blinked at having to navigate four different types of recycling bins 
when they finished lunch (don't forget to compost!)  --  and at a place where 
the program's welcome note ends with, "Vaya con Gaia" ("Go with the Goddess of 
Earth"). 
<P>They knew this was one of the few places to  hear about the Permaculture 
Credit Union  --  the 3-year-old Santa Fe outfit that "strives to redirect 
those resources into Earth-friendly and socially responsible loans and 
investments." Nearly half of the 135 people who signed up for the credit union 
in its first year were Bioneer attendees.
<P>"This is a really great atmosphere for people who think like that," said 
Donald Sarich, the credit union's 33-year-old president.
<P>In recent years, the Bioneers have made great efforts to adjust to one of 
the longstanding criticisms of the environmental movement: that it is largely 
the province of middle-class, middle-aged white folks.
<P>Three years ago after she addressed the conference, organizers say tree-
sitting activist Julia Butterfly Hill asked, "Where are all the young people?" 
And, "Where is the diversity?"
<P>Led by Hill and the Bioneers, the conference recruited and offered 
scholarships to 140 young people and educators this year. Among the educators 
was Alex Sanchez, an ex-gang member who traveled north with a few dozen young 
people from Homies Unidos, a youth organization run in the Pico-Union 
neighborhood of Los Angeles. Recycling isn't a big issue in most of the 
neighborhood; it's a source of income for some, he said. But poor immigrants 
living in condemned, asbestos-filled buildings is a more pressing concern. 
"And once a young person hears about that, and how he can do something about 
it, it raises their consciousness, and they want to get involved," Sanchez 
said. 
<P>For the uninitiated of all ages, you never know when you're going to hear 
something new at a Bioneers confab. In the vendors section, clothier Sharon 
Weberexplained why hemp clothing makes people feel better.
<P>"It emits such a vibrant frequency that it's really much more healthy to 
wear hemp," said Weber, owner of Horizon Hemp Wear in Santa Barbara.
<P>And for those who are not tuned in to the frequency of their clothing  -- 
and who might be alarmed if they were  --  Weber said, "Well, think of all 
the pesticides that are in most fabrics. Cotton is one of the most sprayed 
crops there is. That can't be healthy for you.''
<P>The key, though, to a Bioneers outing, is listening.
<P>"I've been to probably over 700 conferences, and the difference here is 
that people listen," said Howard Lyman, author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684854465/commondreams-20" target="_new">Mad Cowboy: Plain Truth 
From the Cattle Rancher Who Won't Eat Meat</a>.'' As he signed books, Lyman said, 
"Most of the time people like to tell you, 'Hey, here's what I'm doing.' But 
here, people are constantly asking you, 'What are you doing?' 'How are you 
doing it?' ''     </p>
