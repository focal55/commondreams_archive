<p>UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - As many as half a million Iraqis  could require medical treatment as a result of serious injuries  suffered in the early stages of a war on Iraq, U.N. emergency  planners said in a document disclosed Tuesday.<p>

		The total includes some 100,000 expected to be injured as a  direct result of combat and a further 400,000 wounded as an  indirect result of the devastation, according to estimates  prepared by the World Health Organization, the document said.<p>

		The confidential U.N. assessment was drafted a month ago  but an edited version was posted Tuesday on the Web site of a  British group opposed to sanctions on Iraq  (<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/casi/info/undocs/war021210.pdf" target="_new">http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/casi/info/undocs/war021210.pdf</a>)
		<p>

		U.N. officials confirmed the authenticity of the document,  which assumes that unlike the 1991 Gulf War, a new war in Iraq  would develop beyond an initial aerial bombardment into a large  scale and protracted ground offensive.<p>

		"The resultant devastation would undoubtedly be great," the  U.N. planners concluded. The estimates were based on material  from several different U.N. organizations.<p>

		The U.N. staff has been quietly planning for months how to  cope with the humanitarian fallout from a conflict in Iraq.<p>

		But the process has been kept largely under wraps for fear  it might be interpreted as a sign the world body had concluded  the weapons inspections now under way would fail to avert war.<p>

		The confidential assessment assumes that Iraqi oil  production would be shut down and the Iraqi electricity  network, railway and road transportation systems would be  significantly damaged.<p>

		U.N. officials had previously disclosed that as many as 4.5  million to 9.5 million of Iraq's 26.5 million people could  quickly need outside food to survive once an attack began.<p>

		HUGE HOMELESS PROBLEM<p>

		War would also produce a huge refugee problem, driving some  900,000 Iraqis into neighboring countries, with about 100,000  of those requiring immediate assistance as soon as they  arrived, according to the U.N. estimate.<p>

		Another 2 million could be driven from their homes but  remain inside Iraq, where access by relief agencies would be a  particular problem due to the fighting, the planners say.<p>

		The U.N. arms inspections resumed last month, after a  four-year hiatus, under a U.N. Security Council resolution  giving Baghdad a final chance to eliminate any chemical,  biological or nuclear weapons or face "serious consequences."<p>

		Chief arms inspector Hans Blix is due to provide an interim  report to the Security Council on his findings Thursday. His  first in-depth report is set for Jan. 27.<p>

		President Bush, who favors a "regime change" in Baghdad,  has threatened to disarm Iraq through force if it fails to act  on its own, although Washington says no decision has been made  to go to war.<p>

		According to the assessment, Iraq can be expected to have  four months' supply of basic medical supplies on hand at the  start of a conflict. However, some key supplies would still  likely be in short supply or nonexistent, it said.<p>

		Children under 5, pregnant women and mothers who are  breast-feeding their infants "will be particularly vulnerable  because of the likely absence of a functioning primary health  care system in a post-conflict situation," it said.
		<p>

		"Furthermore, the outbreak of diseases in epidemic if not  pandemic proportions is very likely," it said. "Diseases such  as cholera and dysentery thrive in the environment ... When  determining the requirement for pharmaceuticals and medical  supplies, these factors must be considered."
