<p>Senate Democrats launched an impassioned but ultimately futile effort 
Tuesday to prevent the Bush administration from lifting a 10-year-old ban on 
the development of smaller, more usable nuclear warheads and dramatically 
shifting the nation's defense policies.
<P>The procedural vote went 51-43 against the Democratic effort, which pushes 
the proposed repeal of the ban -- and a potentially historic resumption of 
nuclear weapons development -- to the House.
<P>The full House is expected to vote later this week on the issue, which both 
sides say could mark a critical turn in the country's security policy.
<P>The Democratic stance was put in the most graphic terms Tuesday by Sen. 
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who with Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California 
led the effort to retain the weapons ban. The new, low-yield warheads, Kennedy 
contended, would be easier to use and thus make nuclear conflict more likely, 
not less so.
<P>"Is half a Hiroshima OK? Is a quarter Hiroshima OK? Is a little mushroom 
cloud OK?" he asked on the Senate floor. "That's absurd. The issue is too 
important. If we build it, we'll use it."
<P>The Bush administration's efforts to repeal the decade-old prohibition is 
part of its overall $400.5 billion military budget, but it is probably the 
most contentious provision in the bill. The Senate Democrats were trying to 
remove that provision from the budget.
<P><b>'BUNKER BUSTERS'</b>
<P>In the Senate on Tuesday, Republicans stressed that the new types of 
warheads -- which would be the first developed since the Cold War -- were 
needed because of the extraordinary threats the country now faces. The 
warheads are intended as "bunker busters," to destroy underground stashes of 
prohibited weapons.
<P>"I believe this country has a moral responsibility to lead in this world, 
and we will not be an effective leader unless we maintain our leadership in 
all areas, including nuclear weaponry," said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.
<P>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it would be illogical for the United 
States not to develop a weapon that could prevent an attack by destroying a 
foe's buried caches of weapons.
<P>But Democrats insisted that the low-yield weapons, with a force of five 
kilotons or less -- a third the force of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 
1945 -- would make the nation less secure because they would only provoke 
potential foes to hurriedly build up their own arsenals as a deterrent, and 
lead to a destructive proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<P><b>NUCLEAR ARMS RACE</b>
<P>"I can't believe that I have witnessed in my time on Capitol Hill a more 
historic debate than what we are undertaking at this moment," said Sen. 
Richard Durbin, D-Ill. "We are literally talking about whether or not the 
United States will initiate a nuclear arms race again. Nothing that I can 
think of meets this in terms of gravity and its impact on the future of the 
world.'
<P>Added Feinstein: "I deeply believe this bill places America at a crossroads 
in the conduct of foreign policy, and how we determine nuclear weapons policy 
will go a long way to determining whether we control nuclear proliferation or 
expand it. This bill will expand it. Let there be no doubt."
<P>The House Armed Services Committee came up with a compromise version of the 
provision last week that permits design work to proceed on the new types of 
low-yield warheads while still prohibiting production.
<P>If that version passes the full House, the issue would then be decided in a 
conference between the House and the Senate.
<P>Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., later offered an amendment that was similar to the 
House version of the bill, and that is expected to be voted on today.   The 
administration has pushed for repeal of the law, known as the Spratt-Furse 
Amendment, because of what it says are the extraordinary threats the nation 
confronts.
<P><b>ONLY RESEARCH</b>
<P>At the same time, it has said it has no plans to build the new bombs, only 
conduct research. That was the tack taken Tuesday by Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld.
<P>"It is a study. It is nothing more and nothing less," Rumsfeld said. "And 
it is not pursuing. And it is not developing. It is not building. It is not 
manufacturing. And it's not deploying. And it is not using."
<P>Feinstein dismissed his comments.
<P>"Just a study? Baloney. Does anyone really believe that?" she asked.
<P>Later, she added: "I cannot think of a single issue that should more define 
the political agenda today than whether the United States should go back into 
the nuclear business again, and repeal of Spratt-Furse is the first step in 
that direction."
<P>Near the end of the Cold War, the United States not only negotiated a 
series of large reductions in its strategic nuclear weapons with Russia, but 
it decided to withdraw nearly all of its smaller tactical nuclear warheads, 
feeling they were no longer needed.
<P>Congress passed the Spratt-Furse Amendment in 1993 in response to that 
withdrawal. It was an effort to prevent those smaller weapons from returning, 
in large part because they are considered more usable, and thus more dangerous.
<P>The Bush administration has adopted an aggressive nuclear policy, calling 
for a repeal of that low-yield ban and an approach that would permit the first 
use of nuclear weapons to destroy dangerous weapons caches in enemy hands.
