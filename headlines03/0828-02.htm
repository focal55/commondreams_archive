<p>LONDON, Aug 28   - A new report reveals the kind of moves
multinational giants have been making to control decisions at the World
Trade Organization ministerial summit in Cancun next month.

</table>The report by <a href="http://www.foei.org/" target="_new">Friends of the Earth International</a> (FOEI) details
several instances where giant corporations have moved to control
government decisions, particularly in the United States and the European
Union (EU). 
<p>
   ”The EU and the United States must kick off the habit of listening so
closely to large corporations,” FOEI chief executive officer Olivier
Hoedeman told IPS from the group's offices at Amsterdam. ”The report
compiles a number of very disturbing examples of what has gone wrong,
and what can go wrong unless the influence of corporations over the WTO
is halted somehow.”
<p>
   FOEI plans to campaign strongly at Cancun in Mexico during the WTO
ministers meeting September 10-14 to check the power of corporations
over WTO policy decisions that could become binding on governments.
<p>
   ”Behind the rhetoric about 'rules-based trade', 'liberalization' and
the 'Doha Development Round', the reality is that the WTO's trade and
investment rules are consistently being shaped around the interests of
transnational corporations, consolidating their global expansion and
removing any remaining obstacles,” says the report 'Business rules in
the WTO: Who pays the price?' released in London Thursday.
<p>
   The report is presented as a guide for action by citizens. ”A
consistent and focused activist challenge to corporate-led trade
policies is the only hope for making trade and investment serve people
and the environment,” FOEI says in the report.
<p>
   The report looks at the impact of corporations on decisions in four
key areas: food, health and environmental standards, access to essential
medicines, control over foreign investment and access to essential
services.
<p>
   Monsanto and the American Farm Bureau Federation have been pressuring
the U.S. government to use the WTO to force genetically modified (GM)
food onto a hostile EU consumer market, the report says.
<p>
   In 2000 Monsanto, the U.S. firm taking the lead in development of GM
foods, spent more than two million dollars on lobbying the U.S.
government, the report says. This gave the company direct access to
officials and negotiators. The company now has representation on the
Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee for Trade, and the official
Biotech Advisory Panel. 
<p>
   The case for GM foods is being promoted also by the American Farm
Bureau Federation, ranked by Fortune magazine as one of the most
powerful organizations in Washington, the report says.
<p>
   The FOEI report warns of the danger to environmental protection
during negotiations at Cancun. Lobby groups want WTO rules to preside
over Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), and there is ”every
likelihood that WTO will prevail,” the report says. Once trade measures
are included in a MEA, the right of governments to rule in favor of the
environment would be restricted.
<p>
   The report points out that the 38 major industry lobby groups that
make up the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) of the OECD
are supporting the WTO on MEAs.
<p>
   The report includes further warnings on the impact on medicines from
developments on the Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS). A 20-year patent protection period makes drugs
inaccessible to the poorest. 
<p>
   Agreement was reached at the last WTO ministerial meeting in Doha,
Qatar, in 2001 to override patents in poor countries. There were
important agreements reached on treatment for HIV, malaria and
tuberculosis, but other diseases remain uncovered.
<p>
   The report points to the ”enormous influence of drug companies.” The
combined worth of the world's top five drug companies is twice the
combined gross national income (GNI) of all of sub-Saharan Africa, the
report points out.
<p>
   The U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer spent 3.4 million dollars in
2000 to lobby the government. Pharmacia, which later merged with Pfizer
spent 3.7 million dollars. As a result, the U.S. policy on TRIPS bears a
”striking similarity to the wishes of the industry lobby groups,” the
FOEI report says.
<p>
   The report points out that the tobacco giant Philip Morris is
strongly backing moves to bring in a multilateral investment agreement
that could among other things give corporations the right to sue states
directly.
<p>
   With business spread over 148 countries, Philip Morris is campaigning
for a WTO investment agreement through the United States Council of
International Business, and the U.S. chapter of the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a key advocate of a WTO investment agreement.
Such an agreement would give corporations deep inroads into the markets
of developing countries. 
<p>
   That 10 million lives a year will be lost due to smoking by 2030 is
another matter, the report says.
<p>
   Water giants including Suez and Vivendi are seeking to promote
further private sector involvement in water industries and
privatizations.”Suez's extensive involvement in corporate lobby groups
provides it with excellent access to key global decision makers,” the
report says.
<p>
   Among the lobby groups it is acting through are the International
Chamber of Commerce, the transatlantic Business Dialogue, the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development and the European Roundtable
for Industrialists. </p>
