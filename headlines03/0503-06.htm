<p>SHOMALI PLAIN, Afghanistan  - Ten-year-old Shakila  may never marry.
<P>
Three years ago she walked out of her house on  Afghanistan's Shomali Plain and stepped on a land mine that  blew off her right leg.<P>
Shakila is one of the tens of thousands of Afghans who have  fallen victim to land mines, indiscriminate weapons that do not  distinguish between combatants fighting over turf and civilians  simply trying to live their lives.<P>

</table></font>After 23 years of war, the countless numbers of mines that  remain buried in Afghanistan still kill or maim more than 100  people every month. The injuries they cause are devastating for  all victims, but especially for women.<P>
Workers at an International Committee of the Red Cross  orthopedic center in Kabul say that while the injuries carry  little social stigma for men, this is not true for women in a  conservative Muslim country where females are expected to be  perfect models of conformity.<P>
Physiotherapist Rohafza Naudri lost a leg to a mine when  she was 11. She said it is difficult for women with such  injuries to find a husband.<P>
"Nobody wants to marry them, they don't have much of a  chance," she said after fitting Shakila with a new prosthesis.<P>
"People think they can't work at home and they can't look  after the house. It's also difficult for them to make friends,  nobody really accepts them."<P>
Asked if Shakila, a shy girl with a pretty smile and a cute  orange dress, would be able to find a husband, she replied:  "It's very difficult."<P>
Alberto Cairo, the Italian head of the ICRC project,  estimates there are as many as 40,000 war amputees in  Afghanistan, nearly 30,000 of whom are treated at Red Cross  centers which also help victims of polio and congenital  deformities.<P>
BUSY LIMB FACTORY<P>
As well as being a place for treatment, the Kabul center is  a small factory where production lines churn out 350  state-of-the-art prostheses every month.<P>
All the workers on the line are themselves disabled, though  it is often difficult to tell.<P>
The carefully fitted and molded prostheses mean that with  practice, most can walk with barely a trace of a limp.<P>
In an irony that still amuses Cairo after 13 years on the  job, the rubber used to make shock absorbers for the heels of  the prostheses is recycled from Russian tank treads.<P>
"It gives us some pleasure to take something meant for war  and put it to peaceful use," he said. "It's the best quality  rubber -- we are very grateful to the Russians."<P>
Many of Afghanistan's mine victims are wounded by weapons  left over from the 10-year Soviet occupation in the 1980s.<P>
Others are hurt by mines laid during civil war in the  1990s. The United Nations says at least 180 sites were  "contaminated" by munitions, including thousands of deadly  cluster bomblets, dropped during the U.S. bombing that ousted  the Taliban in 2001.<P>
Dan Kelly, head of the U.N.'s Afghan mine clearing  operation, says an estimated 320 square miles of Afghanistan is  mined, denying land to returning refugees, for agriculture and  vital infrastructure rebuilding projects.<P>
The United Nations says it will take another five years to  clear areas designated high priority and a further five years  to finish the job to make life safe for children like Shakila.<P>
It launched a mine awareness month on April 15, with the  goal of encouraging both the government and local factional  commanders to start destroying stockpiles in accordance with  Kabul's accession last year to the global ban on land mines.<P>
Kelly said that in the past 13 years, the Afghan program,  the biggest in the world with more than 7,000 employees, has  cleared about 2.7 million items of ordnance, including a  quarter million anti-personnel mines and 30,000 anti-tank  mines.<P>
DANGEROUS, EXPENSIVE WORK<P>
It is a costly, dangerous and painstaking task and the U.N.  program this year will require $61 million. Although the  project is seen as high priority by donor countries, only about  65 percent of that has so far been offered and there is concern  that demand for post-war Iraq could slow donations.<P>
"Currently we have no actual stoppage of funds because of  Iraq, but as happens throughout the world when there is an  emergency, donor fundings do get diverted," said Kelly.<P>
He said 75 deminers had been killed and 250 wounded in the  past 13 years, but there is no shortage of recruits in  Afghanistan, where demining is considered noble work.<P>
Abdul Razaq, clearing part of the Shomali Plain north of  Kabul, said he would rather be doing the work than pursuing  another calling for Afghan males -- jihad, or holy war in the  name of Islam.<P>
"I respect human life and it is a great honor for me to  save the life of another by risking my own, especially as my  fellow citizens are proud of me," he said.<P>
Razaq said five people and eight farm animals had been  killed by mines where he was working -- part of the front line  between Taliban and opposition forces from 1999.<P>
"Recently, in this garden opposite me, a small boy lost his  leg and four animals were killed by a mine," he said.<P>
Razaq said mine clearance should by the highest priority in  international assistance to Afghanistan.<P>
"Every day we have one or two incidents here. As long as  mines exist, nobody is able to do anything. Farmers cannot work  their fields and there won't be jobs for the people."
<P>
Razaq said the effort was also vital to the success of the  government's faltering bid to disarm rival factional armies.  "If a man gives up his gun to the government, what can he do if  he cannot work because there are mines everywhere?"
