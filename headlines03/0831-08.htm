<p>Many fine volumes about U.S. foreign policy and world events 
have been published in recent months. This one is something special.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801441145/qid%3D1062508541/sr%3D2-1/commondreams-20" target="_new">Corporate Warriors</a>” might just be a paradigm shift. It may 
change the way people look at history and analyze current events.</p>
<p>News junkies know that private military firms, or PMFs, are 
becoming increasingly involved in actions abroad, from reconstructing society 
in Iraq to shooting down drug planes over Colombia and restoring domestic 
security to Liberia.</p>
<p>But until Peter Singer, no reporter showed just how widespread 
PMFs have become and how rapidly they are expanding. One result is that 
today, “plowshares are more easily beaten into swords.”</p>
<p>Before Singer, no analyst offered us a comprehensive 
historical, theoretical analysis of the impact PMFs have, about their positive 
contributions as well as the inherent dangers they pose to social justice and 
world stability.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801441145/qid%3D1062508541/sr%3D2-1/commondreams-20" target="_new">Corporate Warriors</a>” should be required reading for any college 
student studying history, sociology, political science or international 
relations.</p>
<p>But Singer’s volume is also a must-read for any member of 
Congress who wants to make informed decisions about foreign policy in the 
foreseeable future, especially since PMFs, like DynCorp, routinely avoid 
government oversight.</p>
<p>DynCorp employees, most of whom are U.S. military veterans, are 
under strict orders to avoid reporters. Today in Colombia, they regularly 
defoliate fields and fight combat operations against political rebels and drug 
dealers.</p>
<p>Yet DynCorp’s work, often backed with tax dollars, is “entirely 
without congressional notification, oversight or approval,” Singer writes. 
During the company’s Balkan operations, DynCorp workers were implicated in sex 
crimes, prostitution rackets and illegal arms trading.</p>
<p>Private military contracts also add layers of secrecy and 
unaccountability, making it easier for government leaders to implement covert 
foreign policies.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is becoming more centered on profits, rather 
than on political, ideological or religious principles. In Africa, for example, 
the possibility of gaining control over lucrative diamond and gold reserves is 
more compelling to some than promoting democratic government.</p>
<p>And globalization creates ripe conditions for the expansion of 
PMFs. These groups may just become the leaders in the “multinational 
neocolonialism” of the new century, Singer suggests.</p>
<p><b>Broken contract</b></p>
<p>It’s a complex picture painted by Singer, who is an Olin Fellow 
in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the Brookings Institution in 
Washington, D.C., and coordinator of the Brookings Project on U.S. Policy 
toward the Islamic world.</p>
<p>Some PMFs focus on security work for multinational 
corporations, the United Nations or nongovernmental organizations, including 
humanitarian groups. Some PMF employees work to remove landmines from war-torn 
areas in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>At the same time, some governments have grown increasingly 
dependent on PMFs. U.S. firms, for example, provided almost the entire 
logistical and maintenance support for the Saudi army during the Persian Gulf 
War.</p>
<p>On a more theoretical level, Singer expresses concerns 
that “outsourcing” military tasks to private companies may undermine the whole 
idea of the “Social Contract” developed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 
1763.</p>
<p>“When government is no longer responsible for aspects of 
security, the rationale for citizen loyalty is thus weakened,” Singer writes. 
Private warriors owe their first allegiance to private bosses, not to any 
government.</p>
<p>And when profits drive security forces, Singer argues, “the 
wealthy are inherently favored.” The poor are likely to lose, and existing 
social cleavages are deepened in nations from Algeria to Angola, Sierra Leone 
to Sudan, Kosovo to Colombia, and Iraq to Liberia.</p>
<p>Private military forces are expanding exponentially. PMFs 
provided about one of every 100 Americans involved in the Gulf War; they are 
providing one of every 10 Americans involved in the Iraq War.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801441145/qid%3D1062508541/sr%3D2-1/commondreams-20" target="_new">Corporate Warriors</a>” picks three firms to illustrate three 
distinct roles that PMFs play: fighting battles, training advisers and 
providing material support, including everything from fighter planes and ships 
to laundry services and meals.</p>
<p>Vice President Dick Cheney is former CEO of the Texas-based 
company. BRS does everything from engineering and construction, to repairing 
roads, distributing water, generating power and delivering mail.</p>
<p>Singer’s book also places today’s privately paid soldiers in 
historical context. He cites past military mercenaries, including Hessians 
during the American Revolution and the English East India Co. during the heyday 
of British colonialism from the 17th through 19th centuries.</p>
<p>Back in the 1600s, “the conduct of violence was a capitalist 
enterprise” in Europe. Private armies played primary roles in conflicts like 
the Thirty Years’ War from 1618 to 1648.</p>
<p>By the 1700s, wars were being battled between “impersonal, 
bureaucratic” states. The French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars marked the end 
of “hired soldiers playing a serious role in warfare, at least for the next two 
centuries.”</p>
<p><b>Holding the bag</b></p>
<p>Now, that is all changing again. But today’s PMFs are far more 
complicated than mercenaries of the past and are driven by corporate profit, 
rather than individual gain.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Singer said he almost wished his book had 
not yet been published, given recent events showing U.S. military forces are 
even more stretched then they were before.</p>
<p>“The formation and training of the Iraqi army, Iraqi 
paramilitary forces and the Iraqi police will not be done by the U.S. military, 
but by private contractors like Vinnell, Kroll and DynCorp,” Singer said in a 
phone interview.</p>
<p>(Vinnell is a subsidiary of the Carlyle Group, whose leaders 
include former President George H.W. Bush, as discussed in Dan Briody’s newly 
published book, “The Iron Triangle.”)</p>
<p>“There are concerns about contractor no-shows, either because 
of higher costs for insurance premiums or individual contractor unwillingness 
to deploy,” Singer said.</p>
<p>“The result has been that U.S. Army soldiers have been left 
holding the bag. One of the major gripes is that months after the war is over, 
contractors who should have handled the logistics side have not shown 
up.”</p>
<p>Recent developments in Liberia also underscore Singer’s 
point.</p>
<p>“The way we went about playing a role in Liberia is a new 
paradigm. We sent in a small number of U.S. forces, less than 200 Marines. The 
rest of the support will be outsourced.”</p>
<p>The U.S. government awarded a $10 million contract to one PMF 
to provide logistics and transport support to West African peacemakers in 
Liberia. “This limits [U.S. government] exposure by handing off tasks to 
someone else.”</p>
<p>“Corporate Warriors” is a carefully written and documented 
academic study. Some may be tempted to put it aside, after 30 or 40 pages, for 
easier reading. But any effort spent made to complete Singer’s fascinating new 
book is well worth it.</p>
