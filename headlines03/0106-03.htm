<p>BAGHDAD - A defiant Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein Monday declared his country ready for war and issued  his first public criticism of U.N. weapons inspectors, accusing  them of engaging in "pure intelligence work."
<p>

In a 25-minute televised message on Army Day, Saddam  dismissed U.S. threats to disarm Iraq by force as "clamor,  commotion and hysteria" aimed at diverting attention from U.S.  domestic and foreign policy failures, and the Israeli  occupation of Palestinian territories.<p>

An Iraqi man listens to President Saddam Hussein giving a televised message on Army Day at a coffeehouse in Baghdad, January 6, 2003. Saddam accused U.N. weapons inspectors of carrying out 'pure intelligence work' and said that Iraq had prepared for a possible U.S. attack. 'Instead of searching for so-called weapons of mass destruction to reveal the lies of liars...the inspection teams became interested in compiling lists of Iraqi scientists, ask workers questions that are not what they seem and gather information about army camps and legitimate military production,' Saddam said.

</table></font>"As we monitor the hiss of snakes and bark of dogs  accompanied by continued aggression in the north and south of  the country, we act with the confidence of the assured whose  actions are not hurried or confused," he said.<p>

		"Here, we have prepared for everything."<p>

		Britain, Washington's staunchest ally on Iraq, however,  said war with Baghdad was far from a foregone conclusion and  less likely than many commentators implied.<p>

		"There has been so much talk in the newspapers about war,  suggestions that the chance of war are 100 percent, that it's  important to try and correct that impression," British Foreign  Secretary Jack Straw told BBC Radio.<p>

		"What is important for people to understand is that war is  not inevitable."<p>

		The prospect of conflict in the Gulf kept world markets on  edge. Safe haven gold briefly hit its highest level in six  years Monday, oil hovered near a two-year peak and the dollar  dipped.<p>

		As tens of thousands of troops mass in the Gulf and both  sides dig in for possible confrontation, U.N. inspectors once  again fanned out Monday in search of banned weapons.<p>

		One day after searching a record 16 locations, they visited  four sites, including a pesticide factory thought to have been  linked to VX gas.
<p>

SADDAM CRITICIZES INSPECTORS<p>

		U.N. experts, who returned to Iraq on Nov. 27 after a  four-year absence, have accelerated their work checking  Baghdad's claim it has no nuclear, biological or chemical  weapons.<p>

		Iraq has cooperated but some officials have rebuked  inspectors for aggressive and intrusive methods.<p>

		During an address commemorating the founding of the Iraqi  army in 1921, Saddam issued his first public criticism of the  U.N. teams.<p>

		He said rather than searching for weapons of mass  destruction, the inspectors were instead compiling lists of  Iraqi scientists, asking workers misleading questions, and  gathering information about army camps and "legitimate military  production... These things, or most of them, are pure  intelligence work."<p>

		Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and International  Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei are  scheduled to present an interim report on inspections to the  Security Council Thursday, with a second more comprehensive  report due on Jan. 27.<p>

		Any indication Iraq has concealed weapons could trigger a  U.S.-led war to disarm the country and oust its president.<p>

		The New York Times reported Monday that President Bush's  national security team was assembling plans for a post-Saddam  Iraq that included a U.S. military presence in the country for  at least 18 months with a civilian administrator running the  country's economic and political institutions.<p>

		Citing administration officials, the paper said the plan  also calls for military trials of the most senior Iraqi leaders  and a takeover of the country's oil fields to pay for  reconstruction.<p>

		Turkey, whose bases were critical in the 1991 Gulf war to  drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait, may not be as compliant in a  second U.S.-Iraq confrontation.<p>

		Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis told the Hurriyet newspaper  that most Turks were opposed to a war and would not accept  Turkey being used as a staging post.<p>

		He said any decision on support for a war would have to be  approved in Turkey's parliament, where many lawmakers say they  oppose war.
