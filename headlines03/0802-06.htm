<p> Bullets were zinging overhead and fist-sized rocks were slamming them, but the young people didn't flee. <P></P>They were punched and beaten but didn't fight back. <P></P>Finally, their gun-waving assailants gave up and left. <P></P>A bruised Greg Rollins was frightened yet convinced that the calm resistance of unarmed peacekeepers had stopped the violence from escalating.<P></P>The 30-year-old former Vancouver singer says the confrontation in the hills of the West Bank showed that Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) could intervene in a small way while politicians tried to resolve a larger conflict.<P></P> "I never felt my life was in danger, but I did feel that my safety was threatened," Rollins says by phone from Hebron.<P></P> Canadians carry the distinctive red maple leaf all over the world and don't shy away from the worst conflict zones.<P></P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="250">

</table></font>Thousands are working with aid agencies: through the federal government as election monitors and administrators in post-war zones; with churches as human shields and human-rights observers; and as flag-bearers for humanitarian groups negotiating for the safety of threatened families.<P></P>Rollins, who lives in Hebron with nine other volunteers from CPT, is among 41 Canadians in the 143-member CPT, an international violence-intervention effort founded in the mid-1980s by Mennonite, Quaker and Church of the Brethren congregations.<P></P> It was later expanded to include Baptists, Catholics and other Christians. <P></P>"We try to be a violence-reduction presence, to be on the street when violence is threatened and be willing to intervene — physically if we have to," says Rollins, who has been at the Hebron base since February, 2001.<P></P> "Whether it's a soldier beating a Palestinian or a Palestinian who wants to throw stones" at Israeli soldiers, "we will step forward, calmly step in between them to reduce the violence. It's usually one-on-one, not masses of people."<P></P> One of the most dramatic flashpoints for Rollins came last January, when the peacemakers joined workers from Ta'ayash, an Israeli group trying to build peaceful relations in the West Bank, to help Palestinians plough their fields.<P></P> Angry Israeli settlers challenged them and Rollins recalls that the peacemakers helped defuse a potentially explosive situation before the police and army arrived.<P></P> "It's the grandmother effect," he says. "I've seen it work dozens and dozens of times. Just by being there, you head off violence at the pass. <P></P>"As Canadians, we have this privilege of coming from a wealthy, respected nation and it makes people nervous when we show up — they don't want us to see them doing something wrong."
<P></P>
Canadians don't realize how many of their fellow citizens are working in the name of peace around the globe, says former foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy, director of the Liu Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of British Columbia.
<P></P> He's about to publish a new book, <i>Navigating A New World</i>, which examines the global contributions of Canadians, including their support for CANADEM, an Ottawa-based agency Axworthy helped found in 1997. <P></P>The agency boasts a roster of more than 3,000 Canadians trained and ready to go to any hot spot where the United Nations or other international bodies require experts in security, peace-building, reconstruction, administration, logistics or "democratization."<P></P> "The demand for making peace has changed dramatically," Axworthy says from his Vancouver office. "It's no longer just the number of soldiers you have, it's the number of administrators, police, NGOs (non-government organizations), civil groups, human-rights administrators.<P></P> "I think if you used a per capita count, Canada would probably be one of the leading countries in having white helmets, not just blue (U.N.-led peacekeeping) helmets."
<P></P>Michael Nevin, 60, a Toronto activist who works as a compost consultant, says the powerful peace movement of the anti-Vietnam War 1960s sputtered after the end of the Cold War but has been re-energized by the apparent new global arms race.<P></P> "We were lulled into a sense of false security," he says. "The end of the Cold War didn't rid us of weapons, it just got rid of the tension.<P></P> "There are new threats. We're seeing huge spending on armaments. The United States is talking about using nuclear weapons in a conventional war."<P></P>Nevin is a Toronto organizer of Hiroshima Day, part of commemorative events to be held worldwide.<P></P>The events mark the anniversaries of American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. <P></P>The event on Wednesday, at the peace garden in Nathan Phillips Square, will include a lantern-lighting ceremony and speeches calling for an abolition of nuclear weapons and a ban on weapons in space.<P></P> "Growing up in the '50s, I never forgot the horror of Hiroshima," recalls Nevin. "We need to see the younger generation pick up the torch."
<P></P> 
The peace movement is growing again because of opposition to the American missile defense system and the weaponization of space, says Sid Lacombe, campaign co-ordinator of the Canadian Peace Alliance, which represents about 3 million Canadians in more than 120 peace groups and public service unions.
<P></P>
He says it's also fueled by opponents of globalized trade — as a threat to stability and peace in developing nations — who are planning protests on Sept. 11 as a counterbalance to the World Trade Organization summit in Cancun, Mexico.<P></P> "Peace is the word on the street again," says Lacombe about his observations in Toronto.<P></P>"You see it in graffiti and on placards and peace signs along Queen St. from Ossington to Bathurst. It's quite phenomenal, the echo of this movement across the country."<P></P>"It's bred into Canadians," offers Norman Hillmer, international relations professor at Carleton University in Ottawa and author of <i>Coping With The American Colossus</i>.</p>
