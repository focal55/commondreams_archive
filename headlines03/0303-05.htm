<p>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 2 &#0151; Tens of thousands of Pakistanis marched in Karachi today to oppose a military attack on Iraq, shouting "God is Great!" and warning their president to not to buckle under to the United States. </p>
<P> The demonstration, organized by a powerful coalition of conservative Islamic parties, was by far the largest yet in the country by opponents of an Iraq war. Independent estimates of the crowd ranged from 70,000 to more than 200,000 &#0151; far below the million-plus figure promised by organizers, but a potent sign of the clashing pressures on President Pervez Musharraf as a crucial vote nears in the United Nations. </p>
<P> The same religious groups have called for another "million-man march," as they have been describing it, next Sunday in Rawalpindi, near this capital city and where the president resides. They have vowed to hold similar marches in every major city. </p>
<P> The demonstrations followed on the heels of the arrest on Saturday of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, one of the most wanted leaders of Al Qaeda. If pressure at home leads the government to decide, despite the American pressures, to abstain on a United Nations resolution that would open the way to war with Iraq, rather than support it, the arrest will serve as a reminder to the Bush administration of Pakistan's central role in the drive to exterminate Al Qaeda. </p>
<P> The high-profile arrest may also help blunt American concerns that Pakistan is not acting forcefully enough to curb its own Islamic militants.</p>
<P> Pakistan sits on the United Nations Security Council this year and holds one of the swing votes that could mean success or failure for the new proposal by the United States, Britain and Spain to condemn Iraq's record and justify military action. </p>
<P> General Musharraf survived an excruciating turnabout and protests once before, after the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001, when he ended Pakistan's support for the Taliban and became close partners with Washington in its campaign against terrorism. He called that the only realistic choice for the nation, which could not survive economic isolation by the West. </p>
<P> Many Islamic leaders and fervent Muslims here were never happy with that decision. Now, with growing public resentment of American power and what many regard as Washington's persecution of Iraq, a fellow Muslim nation, General Musharraf faces another politically dangerous choice. He will soon have to vote yes or no, or to abstain, on this matter seen as vital by the United States, his most important international ally. </p>
<P> Demonstrations over Iraq will be large and volatile, but are unlikely to bring down the government, said Rasul Baksh Rais, a political scientist at the Lahore Institute of Management Sciences.</p>
<P> "This vote puts Pakistan in a very difficult position," Mr. Rais said. "But I think those who are running the state are very pragmatic and realistic."</p>
<P> "They know that Saddam Hussein is finished," he said. "In public, they can't stand out in support like Tony Blair has, and they need to keep stressing our concern for the people of Iraq, if not Saddam Hussein himself." </p>
<P> For all the public emotions being vented, experts here note, Pakistan also has important financial ties to Saudi Arabia and other Islamic states in the Persian Gulf that are quietly supporting the American squeeze on Iraq. </p>
<P> Pakistan officials say they will not decide on their Security Council vote until after March 7, when the United Nations inspectors are to report about Iraq's cooperation.</p>
<P> At today's rally in Karachi, which proceeded peacefully, there were a handful of pictures of Osama bin laden and Mr. Hussein. Some carried signs with slogans like "No blood for oil" and "Global terrorist: America." White banners simply saying "God is great" were most common.</p>
<P> Large numbers of women were among the crowd, which heard emotional speeches from many of the Muslim leaders who formerly praised the Taliban and who now are in the forefront of the rising Islamic political coalition that won 25 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections last fall. </p>
<P> Their warnings, to the United States and to General Musharraf, were not subtle. "The people will never forgive the government if it supports the United States against Iraq," said Qazi Hussain Ahmed, a top leader of the Islamic coalition. </p>
<P> Syed Munawar Hasan, secretary general of Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest single religious party, said, "Pakistan must use its U.N. vote to foil the American intentions." </p>
<P> The crowd included some people with broader antiwar feelings but was dominated by religious students and militant believers, who make up a significant minority in Pakistan. "Unity is the only way to save the Muslim world from the American infidels," said Mohammad Shafique, 40, a shopkeeper from a poor suburb of Karachi. "America is the enemy of all Muslims, not only Iraq." </p>
<P> Allama Shah Ahmed Noorani, another top leader of the Islamic coalition and a recently elected senator, told the crowd that Pakistan's Parliament should oppose the presence of American forces on the country's land. "The American army should leave, and Pakistan should not allow them to use any air base in our country," he said.</p>
<P> Maulana Fazlur Rehman, a prominent cleric, said millions of Muslims around the world stood with Mr. Hussein. If the Pakistani government does not change its current pro-American foreign policy, he said, the people of Pakistan will force it to do so. "We do not want war &#0151; we want peace," he said.
