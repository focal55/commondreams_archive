<p>LONDON   - Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans  Blix on Thursday attacked the "spin and hype" behind U.S. and  British allegations of banned Iraqi weapons used to justify war  against Saddam Hussein.<P>

  </table></font>Blix, who said this week he believed Iraq had destroyed its  weapons of mass destruction 10 years ago, told BBC radio that  the United States and Britain "over-interpreted" intelligence  about Baghdad's weapons programs.<P>
In response, the British government said it stood by the  case it had made to the public for going to war.<P>
Blix compared London and Washington to medieval  witch-hunters, saying they convinced themselves on the basis of  evidence which was later discredited, including forged  documents about alleged attempts to buy uranium for nuclear  weapons.<P>
"In the Middle Ages when people were convinced there were  witches they certainly found them. This is a bit risky," said  Blix, whose inspectors left Iraq on the eve of war in March  after just a few months of inspections.<P>
Blix said a pre-war British dossier on Iraqi weapons "leads  the reader to conclusions that are a little further-reaching"  than was the case.<P>
"What in a way stands accused is the culture of spin, the  culture of hyping.... Advertisers will advertise a refrigerator  in terms that we don't quite believe in, but we expect  governments to be more serious and have more credibility," he  said.<P>
"BEST ASSESSMENT"<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said a recent report  on the September dossier by parliament's Intelligence and  Security Committee had concluded that the dossier was "the best  assessment of the intelligence available at the time."<P>
That committee, however, also concluded that parts of  intelligence were presented in a misleading way.<P>
Allegations in the dossier that Iraq could deploy chemical  and biological weapons at 45 minutes' notice have come under  scrutiny at a judicial inquiry, which has revealed that the  claim referred only to short-range battlefield munitions, not  long-range missiles as was widely believed.<P>
Before ordering the invasion that toppled Saddam, President  Bush talked of an imminent threat posed by Iraqi weapons as a  prime justification for war.<P>
Blair put Saddam's alleged weapons program at the heart of  his case for supporting the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March.<P>
But five months after Saddam's overthrow, no banned weapons  have been found.<P>
Bush and Blair have said the search will take time and that  evidence will eventually be uncovered.<P>
"The patience that they require for themselves now was not  anything that they wanted to give to us," said Blix, whose  inspectors were forced to pull out of Iraq in March after just  three and a half months' work.<P>
He said the few "minor things" which his teams had  uncovered in Iraq were more likely to have been "debris from  the past" than "tips of the iceberg" of an existing weapons  program.<P>
Blix's comments have been echoed by his successor Demetrius  Perricos, who told Reuters it was becoming "more and more  difficult to believe stocks (of WMD) were there" in Iraq.
