<p>WASHINGTON - Congressional investigators said on  Monday that Vice President Dick Cheney had stymied their  investigation into his energy task force by refusing to turn  over key documents.
<P>
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  Congress, said it was impossible to tell how much energy  companies or industry groups may have influenced the task  force's 2001 report because the administration withheld  important records.<P>
"The extent to which submissions from any of these  stakeholders were solicited, influenced policy deliberations or  were incorporated into the final report is not something that  we can determine based on the limited information at our  disposal," the GAO said.<P>

  </table></font>Administration officials did not account for much of the  money spent on the task force and could not remember whether  anyone took official notes during the 10 Cabinet-level meetings  the group held in 2001, the investigators said.<P>
The report came more than eight months after a federal  judge rejected the GAO's demand that the administration turn  over task force records.
  <P>
Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise advised critics  to put the dispute behind them. "Now that the courts have  dismissed the GAO lawsuit and GAO has issued its final report,  we hope that everyone will focus as strongly as the  administration has on meeting America's energy needs," shesaid.<P>
Instead, the GAO report provoked a new round of complaints  from Democrats in Congress.<P>
"This report is a sad chronicle of the efforts of the  office of the vice president to hide its activities from the  American people," said Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the senior  Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.<P>
The task force issued a report to President Bush in May,  2001. The administration announced an energy policy shortly  afterward, calling for more oil and gas drilling and a revival  of nuclear power. The policy bogged down in Congress.<P>
Critics of the administration, including environmentalists  and some Democrats in Congress, said they suspected the energy  industry had undue influence on the task force.<P>
White House officials argued that the GAO had overstepped  its bounds and forcing them to turn over the records would  hamper their ability to get "unvarnished" expert advice.<P>
The GAO's final report confirmed that administration  officials met with a procession of lobbyists and executives  from the energy industry, including coal, nuclear, natural gas  and electricity companies. But it did not shed much new light  on the task force's deliberations, beyond information already  shaken loose by private lawsuits against the administration.<P>
Those suits forced the release of records from agencies  such as the Energy Department, but not from the White House.<P>
According to the GAO report, administration officials said  no outside groups attended the 10 meetings in Cheney's  ceremonial office in the White House complex.<P>
"However, no party provided us with any documentary  evidence to support or negate this assertion," the GAO said.  "Agency officials could not recollect whether official rosters  or minutes were kept at the meetings."<P>
Cheney's office turned over 77 pages of documents relating  to money spent on the task force, but all were either  irrelevant or useless, the GAO said.<P>
