<p>ENTEBBE, Uganda - President Bush said Friday that
intelligence services cleared his State of the Union speech, which
included a now-discredited allegation that Iraq was seeking to buy
nuclear material from Africa.

The CIA  approved in advance President George W. Bush's accusation in his January State of the Union address that Iraq  had sought to acquire nuclear material from Africa, U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice  said on July 11, 2003. 'The CIA cleared the speech in its entirety... If the CIA, director of Central Intelligence, had said 'take this out of the speech', then it would have been done,' Rice told reporters flying to Uganda on Air Force One with Bush.

</table>Bush's national security adviser specifically pointed to the CIA
and said it had vetted the speech. If CIA Director George Tenet had
any misgivings about that sentence in the president's speech, ''he
did not make them known'' to Bush or his staff, said national
security adviser Condoleezza Rice.
<p>   The issue arose a day after other senior U.S. officials said
that before and after Bush's Jan. 28 speech, American intelligence
officials expressed doubts about a British intelligence report that
the president cited to back up his allegations.
<p>   Those doubts were relayed to British officials before they made
them public, and that word was passed to people at several agencies
of the U.S. government before Bush gave that nationally broadcast
speech. The White House this week admitted the charge about Iraq
seeking uranium should not have appeared in his speech.
<p>   Bush, asked how erroneous material had ended up in the address,
''I gave a speech to the nation that was cleared by the
intelligence services.'' He did not explain how the allegations
wound up in his speech
<p>   But he said he made the right decision about invading Iraq and
asserted that the world is a more peaceful place for it.
<p>   Rice said ''the CIA cleared the speech in its entirety.''
<p>   The agency raised only one objection to the sentence involving
an allegation that Iraq was trying to obtain ''yellow cake''
uranium, she said. Yellow cake is a slightly processed form of
uranium ore the color and consistency of yellow corn meal.
<p>   ''Some specifics about amount and place were taken out,'' Rice
added.
<p>   ''With the changes in that sentence, the speech was cleared,''
she said. ''The agency did not say they wanted that sentence out.''
<p>   Rice made the defense of the White House in a rare 50-minute
meeting with reporters aboard the president's plane as Bush flew
from South Africa to Uganda. Questions about the allegations in
Bush's January speech have followed him on his five-day trip
through Africa.
<p>   The administration is facing rising criticism on another front
in postwar Iraq: increasing attacks against American soldiers
there. Two were killed on Thursday.
<p>   The Senate on Thursday, in a 97-0 vote, called on Bush to work
harder to get other countries to share the military burden in Iraq.
Bush said Thursday that U.S. forces would have to ''remain tough''
in the face of attacks that retired Gen. Tommy Franks said were
coming at the rate of 10 to 25 a day.
<p>   According to Rice, the CIA had mentioned the claim that Iraq was
seeking to buy uranium from Africa in a classified National
Intelligence Assessment made periodically to the president.
<p>   ''If the CIA   the director of central intelligence   had said
'Take this out of the speech,' it would have been gone,'' Rice
said. ''We have a high standard for the president's speeches.''
<p>   Asked whether Bush had confidence in the intelligence agency,
Rice replied, ''Absolutely.''
<p>   When queried on reports that the CIA expressed concern to the
White House about the allegation, she suggested that Tenet should
be asked directly. ''I'm not blaming anyone here,'' Rice said.
<p>   ''The president did not knowingly say anything that we knew to
be false,'' she said. ''We wouldn't put anything knowingly in the
speech that was false.''
<p>   If anyone at the CIA had doubts about the veracity of the
uranium-Iraq allegation, Rice said, ''those doubts were not
communicated to the president.''
<p>   However, she acknowledged that Secretary of State Colin Powell
had reservations about the report and chose not to mention the
allegations in his presentation to the U.N. Security Council a few
days later.
<p>   Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Friday he was concerned about the
reports.
<p>   ''It is apparent now that one of the statements, and a very
important statement made by the president in January, was not
technically accurate,'' he said on CBS' ''The Early Show.''
<p>   The Congress should be concerned, he said, ''if the intelligence
agencies come up with reliable information which is then distorted
by political operatives at the White House.''
<p>   Rice did say that the State Department's intelligence division
considered the uranium-purchasing allegations dubious, and this was
also noted in a footnote in the intelligence assessment given to
Bush.
<p>   Powell, however, did not discuss his misgivings with her or
anyone on her staff between the time of the State of the Union
address and Powell's presentation to the United Nations, she said.
<p>   Other U.S. officials said Thursday that before and after Bush
claimed in January that Iraq was seeking uranium in Africa,
American intelligence officials expressed doubts about a British
intelligence report that Bush cited to back up his allegation.
<p>   CBS, ABC and CNN reported Thursday that CIA officials who saw a
draft of Bush's speech questioned whether his statement was too
strong, given the quality of the British intelligence. But the
remark was left in, and attributed to the British.
<p>   The reports surfaced as Durbin and other Democrats kept up a
drumbeat of criticism of the administration's justifications for
going to war.
<p>   Much of the criticism has focused on Bush's contention that
Saddam Hussein's government had chemical and biological weapons and
was working to build more of them and develop nuclear bombs. No
such weapons have been found in Iraq.
<p>   Critics also have attacked the administration's
characterizations of the current outlook in Iraq, where the war's
former commander, Gen. Tommy Franks, told a House panel Thursday
that U.S. troops may have to remain in Iraq for four years.
<p>   U.S. officials have said the doubts about the uranium
allegations date back to early 2002, when a retired diplomat asked
by the CIA to investigate the reports went to Niger and spoke with
officials who denied having any uranium dealings with Iraq.
<p>   Though the U.S. officials expressed their doubts to the British,
the British included their information in a public statement on
Sept. 24, 2002, citing intelligence sources, that said Iraq
''sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.''
<p>   About a month after Bush's speech, the United Nations determined
the uranium reports were based primarily on forged documents
initially obtained by European intelligence agencies.
