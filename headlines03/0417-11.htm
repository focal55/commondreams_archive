<p>Ralph Nader, onetime Green Party candidate for President and longtime critic of corporate America, cautioned Boise residents Tuesday against “being entertained into powerlessness” by large corporations that control government, media, commerce and many other aspects of modern American life. 
<p>Nader portrayed those responsible for everything from television weather forecasts to $30 bank fees for bounced checks to the military-industrial complex as potential robber barons stealing the very things Americans hold dear from right under their noses. 

<p>“They have no allegiance to any country — except to control them,” Nader told a near standing-room-only audience at Boise State University´s Morrison Center. 
<p>His speech, “The Corporatization of America,” addressed America´s “civic” awakening of the 1960s as the key to many of the nation´s consumer-friendly breakthroughs, such as improved safety in automobiles. 

<p>His speech was well received by the audience, which interrupted him with applause several times. 

<p>“I think he is a true patriot,” Boisean John Sullivan said. 

<p>Sullivan pointed out that many in the audience were college-aged people. 

<p>“I think he´s out here to talk to the young people,” Sullivan said. “To get them thinking.” 

<p>Nader´s speech revolved around the theme that people must retrain themselves to think “civically,” not “corporately.” 

<p>“Most of us have grown up corporate,” he said, explaining that modern society doesn´t question the marketing that deluges children daily on television or the legal control corporations have over consumers´ everyday choices. 

<p>For example, he said technology for collapsible steering columns in automobiles was developed in the 1930s, but not implemented until the late 1960s. Padded dashboards were invented by the ancient Romans for their chariots, he said. 

<p>“General Motors got 2,000 years lead time on that and still didn´t use it,” Nader said. 

<p>He warned the awakening of “civic citizenship” of the 1960s or “growing up civic” could easily be lost to corporations that “regulate our life more than the government.” 

<p>“I´m still waiting for banks to charge me for the frictional wear on the carpet when I walk in the door,” he said to the applause of the crowd. 

<p>Nader also was critical of the Bush administration´s tactics in the war on terrorism, saying they erode individual rights through legislation like last year´s Patriot Act. 

<p>“It all adds up to an erosion of quality of life,” he said. 

<p>He said Americans´ post-Sept. 11 questions about the causes of the attacks can be blamed on corporate exploitation of poor countries and their citizens and the American government´s assistance to those companies — not on individual Americans´ wishes of good will to the world. 

<p>“I do not identify the President of the United States with the American people no matter what party he comes from,” Nader said. 

<p>Government acquiescence in corporate control of the nation also must be overcome, he said. Corporate tax breaks, billion dollar bailouts and government-funded research bought for pennies on the dollar are all part of the problem, he said. 

<p>He resurrected Will Rogers´ famous quote, “The best Congress money can buy,” to drive the point home. 

<p>“That´s half of what Washington does,” he said. “It´s an accounts receivable.”
