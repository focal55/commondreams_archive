<p>BAGHDAD - U.S. troops psyched up on a bizarre  musical reprise from Vietnam war film "Apocalypse Now" before  crashing into Iraqi homes to hunt gunmen on Saturday, as  Shi'ite Muslims rallied against the U.S. occupation of Iraq.
<P>
With Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" still ringing in  their ears and the clatter of helicopters overhead, soldiers  rammed vehicles into metal gates and hundreds of troops raided  houses in the western city of Ramadi after sunrise as part of a  drive to quell a spate of attacks on U.S. forces.<P>

BAGGED<br>
Soldiers from the U.S. Army's First Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment, guard a suspect during a raid early June 21, 2003 in the city of Ramadi, around 100 km (60 miles) west of Baghdad. The raid was part of an operation launched a week ago to stamp out armed resistance to US forces. REUTERS/Aladin Abdel Naby <br>

</table></font>A previously unknown group, calling itself the Iraqi  National Front of Fedayeen, vowed to intensify assaults on U.S.  troops until they leave Iraq.<P>
A man with his face swathed in a red-and-white headscarf  read the threat on a videotape received by Lebanon's LBC  television. There was no way to verify its authenticity.<P>
"If they want their soldiers to be safe, they must leave  our pure land," the man said, disavowing any link to Saddam  Hussein. He was flanked by three masked men with weapons.<P>
Iraqi assailants have killed 17 U.S. soldiers since major  combat was declared over on May 1, three weeks after the fall  of Baghdad ended 24 years of Saddam Hussein's iron rule.<P>
U.S. officials blame the attacks on Saddam loyalists. Many  Iraqis say the resistance is fueled by resentment at the  occupation and the behavior of U.S. troops.<P>
"The Americans are occupiers and aggressors," said Sayyid  Ali, one of about 2,000 Shi'ites who protested outside the vast  palace compound in Baghdad now used by Iraq's U.S. rulers.<P>
"They were supposed to free us from the oppressor, now they  are only occupying us," he said. "We want to form a national  government. "We want freedom and justice."<P>
SOUR PERCEPTIONS<P>
The United States and Britain say their forces will stay  put until they can restore security, revive the economy and  arrange a transition to an elected, sovereign Iraqi government.<P>
However, they have failed to find Saddam or his alleged  arsenal of weapons of mass destruction which they cited as  their main justification for going to war on March 20.<P>
U.S. officials in Washington said the deposed president's  captured former secretary Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti had told  interrogators Saddam and his two sons were alive and in Iraq.<P>
They said intelligence agencies were not certain Mahmud  Tikriti was telling the truth, but that U.S. Special Operations  troops and paramilitary intelligence agents were on an intense  hunt for the three.<P>
Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator of Iraq, said the issue  of Saddam's fate needed to be resolved one way or another,  because uncertainty emboldened supporters of the toppled  regime.<P>
"It gives them an ability to say Saddam is still alive,  he's coming back, and we're coming back, and what that does is  it disinclines people who might otherwise want to cooperate  with us from cooperating with us," Bremer told reporters on a  visit to neighboring Jordan.<P>
President Bush, floating a new explanation for the failure  to find banned weapons, said suspected arms sites had been  looted as Saddam's government crumbled.<P>
"For more than a decade, Saddam Hussein went to great  lengths to hide his weapons from the world. And in the regime's  final days, documents and suspected weapons sites were looted  and burned," Bush said in his weekly radio address.<P>
A U.S. treasury official attending a meeting organized by  the World Economic Forum in Jordan for political and business  leaders, said world donors must provide aid as well as debt  relief to Iraq for postwar reconstruction.<P>
BOOTS AND ALL<P>
Before Saturday's robust sweep through Ramadi, 100 km (60  miles) west of Baghdad, soldiers of the First Battalion of the  124th Infantry Regiment psyched themselves up at a base nearby  in a musical moment redolent of Francis Ford Coppola's 1979  film about the Vietnam war.<P>
Hit-and-run strikes on U.S. troops have been concentrated  in Sunni Muslim towns such as Ramadi west and north of Baghdad.<P>
One unit of troops dragged half a dozen men from their  homes as women wailed. They seized weapons and a computer disk.<P>
Officers said they aimed to capture five men from the  Fedayeen paramilitary force, which put up some of the fiercest  resistance to U.S. troops during their invasion.<P>
The raid was part of Operation Desert Scorpion, launched on  June 15 to crack down on militants and befriend civilians by  helping with aid and reconstruction projects.
<P>
A U.S. military spokesman said on Saturday that 90 Desert  Scorpion raids had captured 540 people.  (Additional reporting  by Andrew Gray and Michael Georgy)
