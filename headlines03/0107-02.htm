</table></font>They are members of <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/cpt/index.html" target="_new">Christian Peacemaker Teams</a> (CPT) and will form a peace delegation jointly organized with Voices in the Wilderness, an anti-war group based in Chicago that has already sent 45 groups to Iraq since 1996. It is also spearheading the Iraq Peace Team, an international group of volunteers committed to remaining in Iraq in the event of war. 
<p>CPT is an organization sponsored by Mennonite, Quaker and Brethern churches. Teams travel to areas of conflict to uphold human rights and promote non-violence.
<p>“Just as soldiers are prepared to sacrifice their lives for the state, as a  Christian who believes in non-violence I am prepared to make the same sacrifice for my non-violent beliefs,” said 38-year-old Jim Loney, a former member of the Toronto Catholic Worker Community now living on a communal farm east of Durham. 
<p>“We are living in a very dark moral time, a time of lies and war and lies to justify war,” Loney said.
<p>The Catholic Worker Movement was founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in New York in 1933. It promotes the transformation of society according to the gospel principles of non-violence, simple living and works of mercy such as feeding the poor and providing the homeless with shelter.
<p>George Weber, a 73-year-old retired high school teacher from Chesley, is appalled at the thought of western countries, particularly the United States, creating a pretext to invade Iraq to secure American oil interests.
<p>“We are going to suffer along with the Iraqis,” he said. “It’s an opportunity to light a candle instead of cursing the dark.”
<p>Loney and Weber left Canada on Thursday along with 69-year-old Larry Kehler of Winnipeg for a two week stint with the peacekeeping delegation. Loney plans on staying an additional two weeks with the Iraq Peace Team.
<p>The group flies to Amman, Jordan, and will travel overland to Baghdad.
<p>Ottawa has issued a travel advisory warning of the dangers of visiting Iraq, but Canadians are not prohibited from going to the country.
<p>Loney has been active in the peace movement since his arrest in 1991 outside the federal Progressive Conservative headquarters in Toronto protesting Canadian involvement in the Gulf War.
<p>Members of the delegation will live among the people, using their presence to show solidarity with the Iraqis. They will meet with community groups,  church leaders and non-governmental organizations to learn about the effects of economic sanctions on Iraqi society. 
<p>“We want to show them that not all North Americans are in favour of the treatment they are getting,” said Weber, a Mennonite who has participated in three other peacemaking missions — to Chiapas in Mexico in 2000 and twice to the Palestinian city of Hebron.
<p>Once they return to Canada, Loney and Weber plan to inform others of what they saw through public speaking engagements.
<p>They will also try to help mobilize Canadian public opinion against impending military action against Iraq and promote lifting the sanctions against the Iraqi people.
<p>Other peacemaker teams that have been to Iraq report severe damage to the country’s infrastructure resulting in a massive public health crisis, especially among the poor, the young and the very old.
<p>According to United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) more than 500,000 Iraqi children have died in the 12 years since the United Nations imposed economic sanctions in 1990.</p>
