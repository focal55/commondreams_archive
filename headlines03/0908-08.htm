<p>SHANNON, Ireland  - Defense Secretary Donald  Rumsfeld said on Monday opposition to the U.S. President was  encouraging Washington's enemies and hindering his 'war against  terrorism'.<P>

  </table></font>Rumsfeld was speaking after a trip to Afghanistan and Iraq  where he sought to highlight progress on reconstruction efforts  and dampen criticism of the U.S. presence there and the almost  daily casualties in a guerrilla campaign against occupation.<P>
He said if Washington's enemies believed Bush might waver  or his opponents prevail, that could increase support for their  activities.<P>
"They take heart in that and that leads to more money going  into these activities or that leads to more recruits or that  leads to more encouragement or that leads to more staying  power," he told reporters traveling with him on his plane.<P>
"Obviously that does make our task more difficult."<P>
"Terrorists studied...instances when the United States was  dealt a blow and tucked in, and persuaded themselves that they  could in fact cause us to acquiesce in whatever it is they  wanted to do," he said. "The United States is not going to do  that, President (George W.) Bush is not going to do that."<P>
Rumsfeld's comments came after Bush said he would seek $87  billion for fighting terrorism and rebuilding efforts in Iraq  and Afghanistan. He spoke also just three days before the  second anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington  which the United States blames on al Qaeda Islamist militants.<P>
CHEMICAL WEAPONS<P>
U.S. soldiers are attacked almost daily in occupied Iraq  and are fighting efforts by Taliban fighters to regroup in  Afghanistan. They are also hunting ousted Iraqi president  Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.<P>
Democratic criticism of the Republican administration's  invasion of Iraq and post-war rebuilding efforts complicated  efforts to try and get the message out that progress was being  made, Rumsfeld said. "It does complicate it, it makes it more  difficult, but I guess that's life," he said.<P>
Critics note the United States has so far failed to produce  any evidence of the production of weapons of mass destruction  though this had been cited as the main reason for the March  invasion of Iraq and overthrow of Saddam.<P>
Rumsfeld met briefly in Baghdad with former U.N. weapons  inspector David Kay, who is coordinating the hunt for the  banned weapons. But he said the half-hour discussion centered  on what assistance the Defense Department could provide rather  than a review of the information being collected.<P>
"We did not have much of a discussion on the substance of  what he is turning up," Rumsfeld said. "I did not go into the  half hour meeting and say 'OK lay out what you've found'. I  went in assuming he'll (Kay) tell me if he's got something that  he thinks I need to know."<P align="center">
