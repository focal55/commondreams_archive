<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Leaders of Islamic  countries Wednesday threw their support behind an initiative by  France and Germany to avert war on Iraq and said they were  considering using their oil to exert pressure on those in favor  of an attack.
<p>

The group also demanded Iraq comply with all United Nations  resolutions to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction,  including the latest deadline to start destroying its  longer-range missiles by March 1.<p>

		"We would like to see that Iraq is not invaded by foreign  forces," Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told a news  conference after a hastily called meeting of Islamic leaders  who had gathered in Kuala Lumpur for a two-day summit earlier  in the week of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).<p>

		"Iraq should abide completely by the requests of  inspectors," he said.<p>

		Participants praised a resolution presented at the United  Nations this week by France and Germany that suggests giving  the U.N. weapons inspectors another four months to do their  work in Iraq.<p>

		"We should make common cause with countries that are  against war in Iraq, namely European countries such as France,  Germany, Belgium and also Russia," Mahathir said.<p>

		"I hope by making a common cause with them we will be able  to exert some influence on the United States," he said.<p>

		A resolution lodged with the United Nations Monday by the  United States, Britain and Spain says Iraq has missed a "final  opportunity" to disarm peacefully and avoid war.<p>

		With the European resolution supported by two permanent  members and signs several revolving members of the Security  Council may not support him, President Bush has said war might  go ahead with or without a U.N. resolution.<p>

		In their NAM summit that ended Tuesday, the mainly  developing countries urged Washington to give peace a chance  and pledged support for U.N. processes.<p>

		OIL AS A WEAPON<p>

		Mahathir acknowledged that some differences existed among  the 49 countries attending the Islamic meeting, but all agreed  on considering using their oil resources as a weapon to exert  pressure on those in favor of war even though this would hurt  many poorer countries, he said.<p>

		"There has been a suggestion that we look at using our oil  wells in order to exert pressure," Mahathir said.<p>

		"How this can be done is something else, but there is a  consensus as to the need for us to think about these things,"  he said of a grouping that includes such oil producers as Saudi  Arabia, Syria, Kuwait and Qatar.<p>

		"Oil is a double-edged sword," Mahathir said. "If (the  price of) oil goes up many of the countries of the South are  going to suffer... This double-edged weapon may hurt us more  than it may hurt the other parties."<p>

		But even as the Islamic states voiced their complete  agreement at least to consider using oil to exert pressure,  they did not ease their demands on Iraq to comply with U.N.  demands.<p>

		"Iraq should destroy to show its sincerity," Mahathir said  when asked about the U.N. deadline for Baghdad to begin  dismantling its longer-range missiles.<p>

		"Anything that the U.N. asks Iraq to do, Iraq should do,"  he said.<p>

		Chief weapons inspector Hans Blix has demanded Iraq start  destroying its longer-range missiles by March 1 and he is due  to present a report to the Security Council around March 7.<p>

		Islamic nations are to meet again for a summit of the  Organization of Islamic Conference in Doha, Qatar, on March  4-5. Iraq has voiced opposition because Qatar is serving as one  of the major bases for U.S. troops massing in the Middle East.<p>

		Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, King Mohammed of  Morocco, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, Pakistani  President Pervez Musharraf and Syrian Vice President  Abdel-Halim Khaddam were among Islamic leaders who joined Iraqi  Information Minister Mohamed Said al-Sahaf for the Wednesday  morning meeting.
