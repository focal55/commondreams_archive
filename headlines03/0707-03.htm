<p>BAGHDAD   - Two U.S. soldiers in Iraq were killed  and four were wounded in a spate of guerrilla attacks in which  at least two Iraqis also died, the U.S. military and witnesses  said Monday.<P>
The latest violence, in Baghdad and a town to the west of  the capital, was the latest indication that U.S. occupation  forces were facing guerrilla warfare in Sunni Muslim central  Iraq, once the cradle of support for Saddam Hussein.<P>
A U.S. military spokesman said one soldier was killed while  a patrol was pursuing Iraqi gunmen in the Azamiyah district of  Baghdad late on Sunday. An Iraqi gunman was killed and another  wounded in the clash.<P>
The second U.S. soldier was killed early Monday when a  rocket-propelled grenade hit his vehicle in the district of  Kadhimiya.<P>
The fatalities brought to 29 the number of U.S. soldiers  killed in action in Iraq since President Bush declared major  combat over on May 1. A soldier was shot and fatally wounded at  Baghdad University on Sunday.<P>
At least one Iraqi man was shot dead and four U.S. soldiers  wounded during a night of attacks in the volatile town of  Ramadi, the military said on Monday.<P>
Six Iraqi assailants ambushed a U.S. position in the town,  around 60 miles west of Baghdad, but it was not clear whether  the attackers used rocket-propelled grenades or a bomb, a U.S.  spokesman in Ramadi said.<P>
"At about that time, one of our vehicles was attempting to  impose a roadblock. A Toyota truck approached. One of the men  in the Toyota truck was shot and killed. The other was detained  for questioning," Captain Michael Calvert told Reuters.<P>
U.S. officers did not say who had killed the man. But staff  at Ramadi general hospital said U.S. troops arrived there late  on Sunday night and left a body of a decapitated man, saying  they had shot him because he did not stop at their checkpoint.<P>
A U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad said four soldiers had  been wounded in the ambush.<P>
On Saturday, seven recruits to a U.S.-backed Iraqi police  force were killed in Ramadi when a remote-controlled bomb  exploded outside a police station.<P>
Ramadi is part of a mainly Sunni Muslim area to the north  and west of Baghdad where U.S. forces have faced much of the  most violent resistance to their occupation of Iraq.<P>
Some residents said two people had been shot by U.S. forces  on Sunday night but Calvert had reports of only one death. He  said there had also been a mortar attack during the night.<P>
<P>
SADDAM ALIVE?<P>
U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Roberts  told CNN Sunday intelligence reports indicated there was now  about a 70-30 chance Saddam was alive, up from 50-50 in the  early days after his ouster by U.S.-led forces on April 9.<P>
Underlining the importance Washington now attaches to  resolving Saddam's fate after putting a $25 million reward on  his head, Roberts said: "It is a big ticket item for us if  we're going to eliminate the fear (among Iraqis) and be  successful."<P>
A taped message purporting to be from Saddam aired on Arab  television Friday told Iraqis to rally behind resistance to the  occupation of their country by U.S.-led forces.<P>
While Washington points the finger at Saddam loyalists,  many Iraqis say discontent is mounting in the country over what  is seen as failure by the U.S.-led administration in Baghdad to  return government quickly to Iraqi hands and rebuild the state.<P>
The chief of Turkey's armed forces said Monday the weekend  arrest of Turkish troops by U.S. forces in Iraq had caused a  crisis in relations between the two NATO armed forces.<P>
"It turned into a major crisis of trust between the Turkish  and U.S. armed forces and became a crisis," Chief of General  Staff Hilmi Ozkok told reporters in Ankara.<P>
The eleven Turkish soldiers were released Sunday evening  and returned on Monday to their offices in the northern Iraqi  city of Sulaimaniya.
