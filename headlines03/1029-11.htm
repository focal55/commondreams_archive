<p>Senior Republicans have begun raising concerns 
              about the administration's strategy in Iraq amid daily attacks 
              on U.S. forces there. 
<p>But congressional Republicans still echo President Bush's 
              overall positive assessment of reconstruction, even as some warn 
              of political trouble unless signs of improvement become clearer 
              fast. 
<p>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who recently compared aspects of the 
              conflict to Vietnam, yesterday said U.S. forces need to be more 
              proactive. 
<p>"To set up roadblocks after the bomb goes off is not the answer," 
              he said. "We've got to get into prevention."
<p>The number of attacks on U.S. forces has increased to about 30 a 
              day in recent weeks, and a series of apparently coordinated attacks 
              rocked Baghdad on Monday. Another attack targeted the a-Rashid Hotel 
              in Baghdad, where Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was staying. 
              
<p>"We need more troops," said McCain. "We need more 
              special forces. We need more marines. We need more intelligence 
              capabilities."
<p>McCain is often among those Republicans most willing to criticize 
              the administration - although he often refrains from doing 
              so on military and foreign policy matters. 
<p>But other Republicans joined him in raising questions about U.S. 
              tactics.
<p>Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
              said he was concerned that U.S. forces were unable to anticipate 
              many of the attacks in a situation he described as tantamount to 
              a guerrilla war in which the enemy is able to strike and then quickly 
              retreat into the population. 
<p>"I can tell you, I'm very worried about the lack of 
              pertinent intelligence to fight that kind of a war," he said. 
              "It appears we have some real problems."
<p>Asked whether he favored any policy changes in Iraq, Sen. Trent 
              Lott (R-Miss.) responded: "We need to have a different mix 
              of troops, is the key. We may need to move some troops around." 
              
<p>Lott suggested moving more troops from the relatively stable south 
              closer to the region around Tikrit, where attacks on U.S. forces 
              have been common. He said there was a need for more trained military 
              police, adding that his comments were not a criticism.
<p>"Honestly, it's a little tougher than I thought it was 
              going to be," Lott said. In a sign of frustration, he offered 
              an unorthodox military solution: "If we have to, we just mow 
              the whole place down, see what happens. You're dealing with 
              insane suicide bombers who are killing our people, and we need to 
              be very aggressive in taking them out."
<p>Republicans fear they could suffer in the polls if the situation 
              does not improve, since the administration's Iraq policy is 
              so closely associated with Bush. 
<p>"Politically, it is difficult," said Sen. Norm Coleman 
              (R-Minn.), "because certainly for the American public... 
              they read: 'Americans killed every day,' and it hurts. 
              But I, at least at this point, am convinced that we're doing 
              the right thing, and we're doing the best we can.
<p>"What's the alternative? It's not to cut and run."
<p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas)said the situation in Iraq "will 
              continue to be a political issue because it will continue to be 
              a matter of public concern as long as there are any casualties." 
              Results so far had been mixed, he said and cited the recent conference 
              in Madrid which secured loans and pledges to help rebuild Iraq, 
              as well as passage of a new U.N. Security Council resolution. 
<p>"What I worry about most is that we will simply lose our resolve, 
              and we won't finish the job," he added. 
<p>GOP criticisms have emerged only recently and no Republican has 
              come close to statements by retired Gen. Wesley Clark and other 
              Democrats that the administration has no plan for Iraq. 
<p>In fact, Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) chided the media for focusing 
              on casualties at the exclusion of positive developments in Iraq's 
              reconstruction. In a sign of the administration's ability 
              to secure GOP unity, Brownback acknowledged that he probably lacked 
              the votes for a compromise plan to provide some aid to Iraq in the 
              form of loans - an idea the White House opposes.
<p>"The opposition, the terrorist groups, the Baathists read 
              our media and read our public opinion polls, and are trying to play 
              to the country's opinion," he said. 
<p>Brownback even said U.S. adversaries were using attacks to drive 
              down support for Bush. 
<p>"Absolutely," he said. "No question in my mind. 
              This is an international media. They know the importance of this."
<p>Bush, who was criticized on the Hill yesterday for saying that attacks 
              in Iraq were a sign U.S. progress and the terrorists' desperation, 
              was resolute at a White House press conference. "This country 
              will stay the course," he said. "We'll do our 
              job."</p>
