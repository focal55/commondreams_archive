<p>The antiwar movement is splintered over how to respond to a conflict in Iraq. Some advocates argue for showy acts of civil disobedience. Others say they fear that too much disruption would alienate the public that they are trying to sway.</p>
<P> The dispute occurs at a turning point for the movement, as the hundreds of thousands of protesters who overwhelmed the streets of several cities last month realize that they have not been able to stop the war.</p>
<P> Since October, a coalition of community and student groups has been planning to respond to military action with acts of civil disobedience. Under the mantra of "no business as usual," the coalition has sponsored protests in at least 12 cities over the last few days.</p>
<P> There have been a "die-in" outside a <org idsrc="NASDAQ" value="SBUX">Starbucks</org> in Austin, Tex.; a sit-in at a congressman's office in Springfield, Mass.; and a blockade of the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, resulting in about 40 arrests.</p>
<P> Even as some protesters staged mock deaths in body bags, others have been arguing that civil disobedience will not serve their cause and that it will only make protesters look unpatriotic at a time when Americans are likely to rally around the president and the troops.</p>
<P> Those organizers say they agree on the need to step up their protest if war begins, but argue that their actions should take the form of additional demonstrations and vigils and, flooding lawmakers' e-mail accounts, acts that an organizer, Tom Andrews, said were "ways that mainstream Americans are most comfortable with and most receptive to."</p>
<P> "Civil disobedience is one form of expression of one's opposition to invasion, but we feel that it's important to have vehicles that everyone can participate in," said Mr. Andrews, national director of <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/" target="_new">Win Without War</a>, a coalition of 36 organizations that includes the National Council of Churches, the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Organization for Women. "We want to be able to reach the mainstream of Americans, patriotic Americans, with messages and communication techniques that will resonate with them."</p>
<P> Antiwar organizers say it is hard to quantify how many people are in their ranks or on either side of the debate. About 75,000 people signed the civil disobedience pledge.</p>
<P> Even groups that plan civil disobedience debate how to interpret the disruption of "business as usual." Some groups like <a href="http://www.bvfp.org/index.aspx" target="_new">Black Voices for Peace</a> argue for a "shutdown strategy" to halt daily life, blocking commuter routes and access to public buildings or gathering places and walking out of school or work.</p>
<P> Other groups whose members have signed the civil disobedience pledge have elected not to do anything to interfere with most daily routines or cast the movement in a bad light. They argue that any protests should aim at "the machinery of war" like recruiting stations and military bases and those who stand to profit from a conflict like military contractors and television networks.</p>
<P> To others in the antiwar movement, though, that is not enough.</p>
<P> "We are clear that not everyone is going to be happy with the actions we are taking once a war starts," said Gordon S. Clark, national coordinator of the <a href="http://www.peacepledge.org/" target="_new">Iraq Pledge of Resistance</a>, a coalition that promises to conduct civil disobedience. "But there's another point of view that says that if we're about to start slaughtering thousands of innocent civilians, you should be inconvenienced in any way possible if it makes you feel the suffering of those people. If your morning commute isn't the way you want it to be, maybe you should take the time to think about the death and destruction that's occurring."</p>
<P> The debate reflects a tension in the movement opposed to military action in Iraq. A number of groups and coalitions have formed since the large-scale protests in October. </p>
<P> International Answer, one of the earliest and most militant groups, has long called for emergency protests at 5 p.m. on the day after any bombing begins. It posted a notice yesterday on its Web site, <a href="http://www%20.internationalanswer.org%20" target="_new">www .internationalanswer.org</a>, saying protests would be held this evening. From Portland, Me., to Portland, Ore., groups aligned with the Pledge of Resistance announced walkouts and protests for within six hours of the onset of military action.</p>
<P> <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/" target="_new">Win Without War</a>, formed as an alternative to more militant groups, took longer to consider its reaction. It said it planned to announce its next moves today. Organizers said they supported more peaceful means modeled on the candlelight vigils on Sunday in more than 6,000 towns or the virtual march, when protesters jammed lawmakers' phone lines with e-mail messages and calls.</p>
<P> "We have taken civil disobedience off the table," said Mr. Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Maine.</p>
<P> Some groups that signed the pledge for civil disobedience said they did not want to disrupt daily life. In Springfield, a few people were arrested after they sat in at the office of Representative Richard E. Neal, a Democrat. The protesters said they did not block anyone from entering the office.</p>
<P> "Something like that might have been an us-versus-them situation," a protester, Joanne Comerford, said. "We didn't want to prevent any constituent from getting the service he or she might need from their congressman. But we said it was incumbent upon us to demonstrate with our bodies our opposition to the war."</p>
<P> Others say disruption is the point.</p>
<P> "The goal is to impose real economic, social, financial costs until we stop the war," said Patrick Reinsborough, an organizer of <a href="http://www.actagainstwar.org/" target="_new">Direct Action Against the War</a>, in San Francisco. "When you have a government out of control, it's essential that citizens get out in the streets. Where would we be without the Boston Tea Party, the women's suffragettes? A lot of us see ourselves in that tradition."</p>
<P> The 75,000 people who signed the resistance pledge agreed to put their "bodies on the line" and not to resist arrest. Mr. Clark sent word to them that their protest would begin with an e-mail message on Monday when Mr. Bush's speech to the nation was announced.</p>
<P> Many protesters said in interviews they would focus mostly on military bases and corporations with military contracts like Caterpillar near Chicago; <org idsrc="NYSE" value="BA">Boeing</org> near St. Charles, Mo.; and DynCorps, now part of Computer Sciences, near Austin, Tex. </p>
<P> "There's definitely a feeling in Austin that the corporate-military-industrial complex has benefited from the war, and they're very connected to the Bush administration," said Missy Bolbecker, the Iraq campaign coordinator with the <a href="http://www.afsc.org/" target="_new">American Friends Service Committee</a> there. </p>
<P> Many groups have attended training for civil disobedience.</p>
<P> "I had this image of the young man at Tiananmen Square who thought he alone could stop a tank," said Rita Lasar, 71, whose brother was killed at the World Trade Center while trying to help a colleague in a wheelchair escape.</p>
<P> "That's how I feel, but I have to go through with this," she said on Monday while preparing to protest at the United States Capitol. "I feel Bush is exploiting my brother's death."</p>
<P> Within hours, Ms. Lasar was among the protesters arrested.</p>
