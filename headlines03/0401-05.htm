<p>DOHA, QATAR --
The al-Jazeera English-language Web site, which was knocked out of 
cyberspace on its first day by irate Web surfers, is forging ahead with plans 
for a relaunch, station officials said Monday.
<P>"There was a huge surge in interest," said Nabil Hijazi, the Web site's 
deputy managing editor, who predicted Monday that the English site could be 
back up as early as the middle of this week. "We expect that to continue. 
People are looking for a fresh voice."
<P>Within a day of its March 24 premiere, amid widespread Western outrage when 
al-Jazeera television aired footage of dead and captured U.S. soldiers, the 
site (<A href="http://english.aljazeera.net" target="_new">english.aljazeera.net</A>) was wiped out by a cyber attack. The older Arabic-
language al-Jazeera site was also shut down by hackers, who replaced it with 
an image of a U.S. flag.

Hackers replaced the content of the English-language Web site of Al-Jazeera with a U.S. flag and a patriotic message <br>
</font> </td>
</tr>
</table></font>It was a fitting start for the new Web site -- which stands to both benefit 
and suffer from the long shadow cast by its parent channel -- the Qatar-based 
station known as the "CNN of the Arab world."
<P>Hijazi said that on its first day, the site attracted a flood of genuine 
visitors in addition to the server-jamming wave of requests known as a denial-
of-service attack.
<P>When the site does come back, it can count on intense Western scrutiny.
<P>Already, Joanne Tucker, the English site's managing editor, says Yahoo and 
AOL have refused to run ads for the new site.
<P>For many in the West, the al-Jazeera brand name has been synonymous with 
anti-U.S. bias -- and the recent controversy has only heightened that 
perception.
<P>The Web site did nothing to dispel that perception in its brief premiere. 
Headlines dripped with sarcasm. One read: "U.S. 'precision' bomb destroys 
civilian bus."
<P>Another story, headlined "U.S. remembers Geneva convention," mocked the 
Americans for insisting that the rules of war forbid humiliating displays of 
prisoners of war. "Images of surrendering Iraqi soldiers being forced to kneel 
down and body-searched by U.S. troops stirred few emotions in the Western 
world," the text said.
<P>Web site executives concede that the tone caused offense, and they say the 
resuscitated site will be less aggressively anti-American.
<P>But they vow to keep the site up and running, despite the threat of further 
attacks.
<P>"It's a must," said Ibtisam al Gindi, the head of mass communications at 
Qatar University. "It should have been here before. It's almost too late."
<P>As for al-Jazeera's coverage, al Gindi agrees that the channel is not 
objective -- but then neither is anybody else, she says.
<P>"You can't separate a person from the culture they were raised in," she 
said. "It's one side's subjectivity against the other side's subjectivity."
<P>Many in the West aren't buying that argument. In the wake of last week's 
stir over the parent channel airing photos of POWs, a pair of al-Jazeera Wall 
Street correspondents had their press credentials abruptly revoked by the New 
York Stock Exchange.
<P>The channel, which is funded by the Qatari government and stocked with 
veterans of the defunct BBC Arabic television service, made its reputation 
covering the second Palestinian intifada and the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan.
<P>In its seven-year existence, al-Jazeera television has drawn the ire of 
both the Bush administration, for its airing of Osama bin Laden videos, and 
several Middle Eastern governments, for its willingness to host critics of the 
local regimes.
<P>Tucker, who came to al-Jazeera after spending six years as a producer with 
the BBC, said the U.S. government had gradually softened its approach to the 
channel.
<P>"Initially (after Sept. 11, 2001), it was tense because we were the only 
channel airing the enemy's point of view," she said. "They now understand that 
we are not the Osama bin Laden channel."
<P>In fact, the U.S. military, which is running the Iraq war from a base 
outside of al-Jazeera's home city of Doha, has worked hard to maintain good 
relations with the channel. The preparations for the Iraqi campaign featured 
an overt charm campaign that one Western journalist characterized as "somewhat 
sycophantic."
<P>Al-Jazeera reporters were offered extra spots as "embedded" journalists 
with the U.S. military, though the station had to decline spots in Bahrain and 
Kuwait because of its rocky relationship with the host countries, which it has 
reviled for providing aid to the U.S. military.
<P>In early March, several Central Command public information officers even 
attended a barbecue at the home of al-Jazeera's news director.
<P>Jihad Ali Ballout, the channel's spokesman, said he didn't expect that 
warmer relationship to be permanently disrupted by the POW controversy. With 
45 million Arabic speaking viewers, he said, the channel is simply too 
important to alienate.
<P>"Al-Jazeera has proven itself to be a major player," Ballout said. "It 
makes sense to use al-Jazeera to reach the Arab world."
<P>Now as al-Jazeera turns its sights on an English-speaking audience, Tucker 
has assembled a staff made up largely of cultural half-breeds. Almost everyone 
in the newsroom is either half-Arab, Arab raised in the West or a Westerner 
with extensive Middle Eastern experience and language abilities.
<P>The office demographics are no accident. Tucker, a Lebanese American, says 
she deliberately sought "people with a foot in both cultures" to help forge an 
independent voice.
<P>"Whatever people think of it, I known there will be nothing else like it," 
she said. "This is a hugely important region, and you can't only cover it from 
a Western-centric perspective."</p>
