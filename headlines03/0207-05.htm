<p>MEXICO CITY  - Rights experts and diplomats are skeptical about the real impacts of Wednesday's decision by the International Court of Justice to order the United States to temporarily stay the execution of three Mexican prisoners facing death sentences.
<p>
 


Washington will continue to follow its unilateral international policy and will not respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), says Mexican political expert Alfonso Zárate.
<p>
 


Mexico's ambassador to the Netherlands, Santiago Oñate, expressed a similar opinion, saying the ruling marks a diplomatic victory for his country but is no guarantee that the executions of the three Mexican prisoners in the United States will be called off.
<p>
 


The Court, the maximum legal arm of the United Nations, ordered the United States, in a unanimous decision by the 15-judge panel, to stay the executions of three of the 51 Mexicans condemned to death in that country.
 <p>
 


The ruling states that more time is needed to determine whether the Mexicans on death row had been granted their due right to legal help from their own government.
 <p>
 


Mexico filed a complaint in January with the ICJ that the United States failed to comply with the Vienna Convention on consular relations by not allowing Mexican citizens arrested in U.S. territory to receive consular assistance.
<p>
 


Although Mexico, which opposes the death penalty outright, asked for a stay on the death sentences for all 51 inmates, the ICJ decision only affects the cases of César Fierro and Roberto Moreno, imprisoned in the state of Texas, and Osvaldo Torres, in Oklahoma.
<p>
 


Mexico's original complaint before the ICJ covered the cases of 54 Mexicans in U.S. prisons, but in mid-January the governor of the northern state of Illinois issued a blanket pardon to all death row inmates in that state, including three Mexicans.
<p>
 


The Vienna Convention requires the police and legal authorities of the signatory countries to facilitate communication between foreign detainees and their consulate. This did not happen in most of the cases of the Mexicans sentenced to death in the United States, according to the Vicente Fox  government.
<p>
 


The U.S. delegation to the international court, however, maintained that Mexico had not demonstrated that the rights of its citizens were not respected in accordance with the Vienna Convention.
<p>
 


Political expert Zárate predicts Washington will ignore the ruling, just as it has in past cases.
<p>
 


Last year, the ICJ ordered the United States to suspend the execution of German citizen Walter LaGrand, ruling that he had not been permitted consular assistance. Nevertheless, LaGrand was executed by authorities in the southwestern state of Arizona.
<p>
 


Ambassador Oñate applauded the ICJ ruling as a victory for international justice, but noted that there is little recourse to ensure that the decisions will be heeded. However, ICJ sources said the Court does have the option to appeal to the United Nations Security Council, which in turn could impose sanctions if the ruling is not obeyed.
<p>
 


Edgar Cortes, director of the Agustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, which has ties to the Catholic Jesuit order, commented that the ICJ ruling holds important moral force and urged international pressure on the United States to comply.
<p>
 


The latest state execution of a Mexican citizen in the United States took place in August in Texas. Javier Suárez, who confessed to murdering an anti-drugs agent, was the fifth Mexican executed in U.S. territory since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated after a four-year hiatus.
<p>
 


The London-based rights organization Amnesty International sees capital punishment as barbaric and its implementation as highly racist, and has repeatedly protested that U.S. legal authorities do not inform foreign citizens of their consular rights when they are charged with a crime.</p>
