<p>TIKRIT, Iraq - If they had the chance, U.S.  soldiers at a base in Iraq would have had one question for  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- When are we going home?.<P>

  </table></font>But Rumsfeld canceled a speech he was due to give on Friday  to the troops at their base at the palace of deposed Iraqi  leader Saddam Hussein in his hometown of Tikrit.<P>
"I don't give a damn about Rumsfeld. All I give a damn  about is going home," Specialist Rue Gretton said, humping  packs of water bottles on his shoulders from a truck.<P>
"The only thing his visit meant for us was we had to clean  up a lot of mess to make the place look pretty. And he didn't  even look at it anyway," Gretton said after soldiers swept the  dusty streets around the complex of lakes and mansions.<P>
They also erected a stage and set out chairs for a speech  that Rumsfeld canceled due to a tight schedule. Instead, the  Pentagon chief briefly thanked soldiers after a meeting with  military leaders.<P>
"It was good for morale," said Major Josslyn Alberle, a  spokeswoman for the Fourth Infantry Division headquartered at  the palace.<P>
Sergeant Green, 40, did not think so.<P>
"If I got to talk to Rumsfeld I'd tell him to give us a  return date. We've been here six months and the rumor is we'll  be here until at least March. This is totally, totally uncalled  for," she said.<P>
Green, who asked not to be identified by her first name,  complained she would miss seeing her 16-year-old through her  whole school year.<P>
HARD, REAL HARD<P>
Rumsfeld has been criticized for sending too few troops to  Iraq leaving them stretched thin on extended deployments trying  to help rebuild the country and fight a guerrilla war. He has  urged allies to supply some 15,000 additional troops and hopes  training Iraqi forces will ease the burden on U.S. troops.<P>
When the Armed Forces Network showed earlier footage of  Rumsfeld saying that fresh U.S. troops were unnecessary in  Iraq, soldiers at the base threw their hands in the air and  shouted "No way" at the television.<P>
"I ain't happy. No way am I happy seeing that," said  Specialist Devon Pierce, whose wife was due to give birth to  his first son in two weeks. "This tour is hard, real hard. It's  too much. It should be six months."<P>
Other soldiers said they could not complain openly about  their long deployment for fear of being disciplined. Earlier  this year, military leaders warned their troops they should not  show disrespect for Rumsfeld after a rash of criticism from  soldiers in Iraq appeared in the media.<P>
Guerrillas regularly attack the palace complex with mortars  and rockets. But soldiers acknowledged that with  air-conditioned rooms and burgers and hot dogs in the mess hall  they had it easier than many of the more than 150,000 U.S.  troops in Iraq.<P>
Many also said that while they wanted to be with their  families at backyard barbecues or on trips to the baseball  park, they knew what they signed up for by joining the army and  were committed to stabilizing Iraq.
