In 1991, a national wind resource 
              inventory taken by the U.S. Department of Energy startled the world 
              when it reported that the three most wind-rich states - North 
              Dakota, Kansas, and Texas - had 
              enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national electricity needs. 
              Now a new study by a team of engineers at Stanford reports that 
              the wind energy potential is actually substantially greater than 
              that estimated in 1991.  
      <p>
              Advances in wind turbine design since 1991 allow turbines to operate 
              at lower wind speeds, to harness more of the wind's energy, and 
              to harvest it at greater heights -- dramatically 
              expanding the harnessable wind resource. Add to this the recent 
              bullish assessments of offshore wind potential, and the enormity 
              of the wind resource becomes apparent. Wind power can meet not only 
              all U.S. electricity needs, but all U.S. energy needs.  
      <p>
              In a joint assessment of global wind resources called Wind Force 
              12, the European Wind Energy Association and Greenpeace concluded 
              that the world's wind-generating potential -- assuming 
              that only 10 percent of the earth's land area would be available 
              for development -- is 
              double the projected world electricity demand in 2020. A far larger 
              share of the land area could be used for wind generation in sparsely 
              populated, wind-rich regions, such as the Great Plains of North 
              America, northwest China, eastern Siberia, and the Patagonian region 
              of Argentina. If the huge offshore potential is added to this, it 
              seems likely that wind power could satisfy not only world electricity 
              needs but perhaps even total energy needs.
               <p>
              Over the last decade wind has been the world's fastest-growing energy 
              source. Rising from 4,800 megawatts of generating capacity in 1995 
              to 31,100 megawatts in 2002, it increased a staggering sixfold. 
              Worldwide, wind turbines now supply enough electricity to satisfy 
              the residential needs of 40 million Europeans.  
               <p>
              Wind is popular because it is abundant, cheap, inexhaustible, widely 
              distributed, climate-benign, and clean -- attributes 
              that no other energy source can match. The cost of wind-generated 
              electricity has dropped from 38¢ a kilowatt-hour in the early 1980s 
              to roughly 4¢ a kilowatt-hour today on prime wind sites. Some recently 
              signed U.S. and U.K. long-term supply contracts are providing electricity 
              at 3¢ a kilowatt-hour. Wind Force 12 projected that the average 
              cost per kilowatt hour of wind-generated electricity will drop to 
              2.6¢ by 2010 and to 2.1¢ by 2020. U.S. energy consultant Harry Braun 
              says that if wind turbines are mass-produced on assembly lines like 
              automobiles, the cost of wind-generated electricity could drop to 
              1-2¢ per kilowatt hour.  <p>
              Although wind-generated electricity is already cheap, its cost continues 
              to fall. In contrast with oil, there is no OPEC to set prices for 
              wind. And in contrast to natural gas prices, which are highly volatile 
              and can double in a matter of months, wind prices are declining. 
               <p>
              Another great appeal of wind is its wide distribution. In the United 
              States, for example, some 28 states now have utility-scale wind 
              farms feeding electricity into the local grid. While a small handful 
              of countries controls the world's oil, nearly all countries can 
              tap wind energy.  
               <p>
              Denmark leads the world in the share of its electricity from wind -- 20 
              percent. In terms of sheer generating capacity, Germany leads with 
              12,000 megawatts. By the end of 2003, it will have already surpassed 
              its 2010 goal of 12,500 megawatts of generating capacity. For Germany, 
              this rapid growth in wind power is central to reaching its goal 
              of reducing carbon emissions 40 percent by 2020.  
               <p>
              Rapid worldwide growth is projected to continue as more countries 
              turn to wind. In addition to the early leaders -- Denmark, 
              Germany, Spain, and the United States -- many 
              other countries have ambitious plans, including the United Kingdom, 
              France, Brazil, and China.  <p>
              In densely populated Europe, the off-shore potential for developing 
              wind is also being exploited. Denmark is now building its second 
              off-shore wind farm, this one with 160 megawatts of generating capacity. 
              Germany has some 12,000 megawatts of off-shore generating capacity 
              under consideration.  <p>
              Wind power is now a viable, robust, fast-growing industry. Cheap 
              electricity from wind makes it economical to electrolyze water and 
              produce hydrogen. Hydrogen is the fuel of choice for the highly 
              efficient fuel cells that will be used widely in the future to power 
              motor vehicles and to supply electricity, heating, and cooling for 
              buildings. Hydrogen also offers a way of storing wind energy and 
              of transporting it efficiently by pipeline or in liquefied form 
              by ship.  <p>
              With the wind industry's engineering know-how and manufacturing 
              experience, it would be relatively easy to scale up the size of 
              the industry, even doubling it annually for several years, if the 
              need arose. If, for example, crop-shrinking heat waves raise food 
              prices and generate public pressure to quickly reduce carbon emissions 
              by replacing coal and oil with wind and hydrogen, it will be possible 
              to do so. If the need arises to shift quickly to hydrogen-fueled 
              automobiles, this can be done by converting gasoline-burning internal 
              combustion engines to hydrogen with inexpensive conversion kits. 
               <p>
              For energy investors, growth in the future lies with wind and the 
              hydrogen produced with cheap wind-generated electricity. Solar cell 
              sales are growing at over 30 percent a year and are likely to supply 
              much of the electricity for the 1.7 billion people who are still 
              without electricity, most of them living in developing country villages. 
              But solar cells are still too costly to supply the vast amounts 
              of energy required to power a modern economy.  <p>
              World coal burning peaked in 1996 and has fallen 2 percent since 
              then. It is a fading industry, not an exciting investment prospect. 
              Nor is oil particularly promising, since world production is not 
              likely to expand far beyond current levels. Production of natural 
              gas, the cleanest and least climate-disruptive of the fossil fuels, 
              is likely to continue expanding for a few more decades, fortuitously 
              developing an infrastructure that can be adapted for hydrogen. Nuclear 
              power generation is expected to peak soon, when the large number 
              of aging plants that will be closing down will exceed the small 
              number of plants that are under construction.  <p>
              The energy future belongs to wind. The world energy economy became 
              progressively more global during the twentieth century as the world 
              turned to oil. It promises to reverse direction and become more 
              local during the twenty-first century as the world turns to wind, 
              wind-generated hydrogen, and solar cells. Wind and wind-generated 
              hydrogen will shape not only the energy sector of the global economy 
              but the global economy itself. </p>
