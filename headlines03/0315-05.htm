<p>MUNICH --  
German Development Minister Heidemarie Wielczorek-Zeul was on a high 
when she arrived at a TV studio recently for a panel discussion fresh from 
joining 600,000 protesters in Berlin marching against a U.S.-led war on Iraq.
<P>"I was immensely proud to take part in that great demonstration for peace," 
said Wielczorek-Zeul, a close associate of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder since 
the 1970s, when both were leaders of an anti-U.S. youth wing of the Social 
Democratic Party. "After all, the Americans don't care about democracy in the 
Middle East."

</table></font>But a sharp rebuke from one of the panelists suddenly caused her to fall 
silent.
<P>"Only last week Saddam Hussein had 13 people executed in Baghdad, but 
nobody here demonstrated," said Hussein al Mozani, a prominent Iraqi writer 
who lives in exile in Germany. "And nobody went on the street to express their 
horror at the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis over the 
years. Hussein can be removed only by war."
<P>Wielczorek-Zeul hasn't been the only Cabinet minister to be lectured by an 
Iraqi exile.
<P>When Family Minister Renate Schmidt, a Social Democrat from Bavaria, 
enthusiastically praised the Berlin marchers on another talk show for 
"standing up against a terrible, totally unjustifiable war," she was 
challenged by journalist Namo Azis.
<P>"All these demonstrations are not in the interest of the Iraqi people, who 
for years have been terrorized, raped, brutalized," he said.
<P>Looking at the flustered Schmidt, Azis added, "The German government is 
very short-sighted, and it's not surprising that Chancellor Schroeder and 
Foreign Minister (Joschka) Fischer have been cheered for their anti-war stance 
by Iraq's government-controlled press."
<P>But such sentiments are the exception these days in Germany, as anti-U.S. 
sentiment over the looming war with Iraq is increasingly coupled with a hatred 
of all things American.
<P>In September, Schroeder won a tough election only after pledging to oppose 
a war against Iraq. A recent survey by the Public Opinion Poll showed that 
only 15 percent of Germans and 8 percent of Austrians believed the American 
way of life was something to strive for. In the same poll, President Bush was 
rated as no more "likable" than Hussein.
<P>"It increasingly takes guts to be for the Americans" these days, said Heinz 
Graefer, a Munich sociologist.
<P>Although Germans who support Bush's position appear to be in the 
minority, there are some who say they understand it in view of the Sept. 11 
attacks.
<P>"The U.S. doesn't want to take any chances that there will be future 
attacks," said Manfred Hildmann, a 46-year-old accountant from the Bavarian 
town of Freilassing. "If you consider Saddam Hussein's dreadful actions in the 
past, it's plausible that he is working on weapons of mass destruction and 
willing to turn them over to terrorists."
<P>But for many Germans, America-bashing has become a favorite pastime.
<P>Entertainers appear to be the most outspoken critics, voicing not only 
fierce opposition to a war in Iraq, but singling out Bush. Last month, 19 
prominent German intellectuals signed a declaration strongly supporting 
Schroeder's anti-war position, including Nobel Prize laureate Gunter Grass and 
playwright Martin Walser.
<P>The major conduits for anti-U.S. sentiment are the ubiquitous television 
talk shows.
<P>"Iraq would be of no interest to the U.S. if it didn't have oil," said 
Senta Berger, the Austrian-born actress who spent several years in Hollywood 
during the 1960s. On ZDF TV, she likened the impending war with Iraq to the 
Nazis' attempt to secure oil fields in the Caspian region by laying siege to 
Stalingrad in 1943.
<P>On another program, popular TV actor Uwe Friedrichsen said: "When Hitler 
invaded Poland in 1939, he faked a Polish military attack on a German border 
town as a pretext. But in the case of Iraq, the Americans don't even bother to 
fabricate such excuses."
<P>Prominent playwright Peter Handke, whose plays are mainstays on the German 
stage, said the United States should be disarmed, not Iraq. "That would be the 
solution to the current problem, because it's the Americans who have the most 
atrocious weapons," he said.
<P>In the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine, Alice Schwarzer, a noted 
feminist author, said: "The world superpower USA no longer seems accustomed to 
anyone contradicting its views, not even on issues about life and death, the 
death of others."
<P>A regular on the America-bashing circuit is Konstantin Wecker, a 55-year-
old singer-songwriter who is a household name in Germany. Wecker recently 
returned from a highly publicized "peace trip" to Baghdad that his critics 
called a publicity stunt.
<P>"In the event of war with Iraq, the German government should close down all 
overflights of U.S. military planes," Wecker told a Munich newspaper.
<P>Leaders of the leftist peace movement that organized huge protests against 
U.S. troops deployed in West Germany in the 1980s are back in action as well. 
One is Eugen Drewermann, a 62-year-old theologian, who recently said on ARD TV:
<P>"If Bush wants to fight evil, he should start on his own psyche."
<P>Expressing pity for the "poor people held as prisoners by the Americans 
at Guantanamo," Drewermann held the United States responsible for starting the 
Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and lavished praise on Dustin Hoffman and other U.S.
<P>actors "for publicly standing up against Bush and his war plans" at the 
recent Berlin film festival.
<P>The surge of anti-Americanism is particularly striking in view of the huge 
debt Germany owes the United States for providing generous help in the post-
war reconstruction era, security during the Cold War and decisive assistance 
in gaining unification more than a decade ago.
<P>"Anti-American sentiment no longer is the traditional preoccupation of 
either leftist or rightist newspaper feature editors," said Michael Stuermer, 
a leading editorial writer at the conservative Die Welt. "It unstoppably is 
becoming a sort of matter-of-course mood for the whole country."
<P>A patron in his 30s at a Munich beer hall put it more bluntly: "We are 
all fed up with Americans looking down at us for the Holocaust -- something 
that our generation had nothing to do with," he said. "Now, the Americans are 
all set to start their own holocaust in Iraq."
<P>Feeling free of any guilt for the Nazi crimes, many of Germany's younger 
generation are taking another look at World War II, with some even regarding 
the Germans as victims of the conflict.
<P>Historian Joerg Friedrich recently shattered a taboo by writing a best-
selling book "The Fire -- Germany and the Bombardment 1940-1945" about the 
destruction of German cities by U.S. and British bombers. The book, which 
condemns the attacks as war crimes and indirectly suggests that they may be 
comparable to the Holocaust, inspired a recent series on German TV.</p>
