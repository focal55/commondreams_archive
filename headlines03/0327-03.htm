<p>OTTAWA -- U.S. Ambassador Paul Cellucci was delivering a rebuke straight from President George W. Bush's White House this week when he complained of Canada's refusal to participate in the war in Iraq, U.S. officials confirmed yesterday.</P>

</table></font>Despite Liberal government assurances that the Bush administration had accepted the Canadian decision gracefully, U.S. officials say Mr. Bush and his advisers are furious, not only with the decision to stay out of the battle but also with what they say is the anti-American rhetoric that Prime Minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien has tolerated.</P><P> Sources said national security adviser Condoleezza Rice consulted Mr. Cellucci about the message he was to deliver at a breakfast speech on Tuesday in Toronto.</P><P> "This came right from the top," one U.S. official said.</P><P> When Mr. Chr&eacute;tien announced the Canadian position, Liberal ministers had assured the Bush team that, while Canada would not participate in the war, it also would not criticize the U.S. and British effort in Iraq.</P><P> However, American officials noted that Mr. Chr&eacute;tien quickly characterized the war as "unjustified" and then failed to condemn Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal, who called Mr. Bush a "failed statesman."</P><P> Mr. Cellucci referred specifically to Mr. Dhaliwal's comments and Mr. Chr&eacute;tien's failure to rebuke him when he expressed the U.S. disappointment with Canada.</P><P> A spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office said there was advance warning that Mr. Cellucci would express U.S. frustration with Canada in his speech.</P><P> "We were made aware informally that the speech would be made and that the word 'disappointed' would be used," Stephen Hogue, press secretary for Mr. Chr&eacute;tien, said.</P><P> He noted that U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher had already indicated that the administration was disappointed with the Canadian position.</P><P> However, Mr. Cellucci's comments were more pointed, saying the Americans were not only disappointed but also "upset" with Canada and complaining about language uncomplimentary to Mr. Bush from Liberal MPs and cabinet ministers.</P><P> U.S. diplomats have delivered similar messages in other countries that have failed to back the war in Iraq. In Mexico, which had a key seat on the Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Tony Garza, a Texas friend of Mr. Bush, irritated many Mexicans earlier this month when he said that the U.S. administration would not be "placated" by any half-hearted support from its neighbors.</P><P> Gordon Giffin, a former U.S. ambassador to Ottawa who maintains close ties in Washington and Ottawa, said Canadians need to recognize that emotions are running high in the United States with reports of American soldiers being killed and captured in Iraq.</P><P> "We're at a time now that is quite difficult in this country, and it is not an academic discussion here," Mr. Giffin said. "There are people being killed and people being held hostage."</P><P> Despite widespread fears in the business community, senior Liberal strategists are convinced that there will not be an economic backlash from the decision not to participate in Iraq &#151; just as there will be no payoff for Canada's role in supporting U.S. action in Afghanistan.</P><P> However, Mr. Cellucci warned obliquely that there could be some disruption in Canada-U.S. trade relations, saying "security will trump trade." One issue that could be a problem concerns Canada's efforts to win an exemption from new U.S. rules that will require visitors to register on entry and exit.</P><P> Officials from both governments said yesterday there is no indication that the strained relations will derail scheduled meetings.</P><P> Deputy Prime Minister John Manley expects to meet in Washington with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Thomas Ridge in early April, while Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Ottawa for an official visit in early May.</P><P> Mr. Cellucci suggested, however, that Mr. Bush is a wartime president and may have to cancel the visit.</P><P><i>With a report from Barrie McKenna</i>
