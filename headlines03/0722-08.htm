<p>BEIJING/LONDON  - British Prime Minister Tony  Blair's personal standing has been hammered by a political  controversy over the Iraq war which led to the death of a  government scientist, opinion polls showed Tuesday.<P>
But despite falling ratings and worried currency markets,  Blair declared he had no regrets about joining Washington in  the war to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, saying in  China: "It was the right thing to do."<P>

</table></font>An ICM poll in the Guardian newspaper showed public trust  in Blair -- once one of the most popular prime ministers in  British history -- slumped by 12 points in the past month to 39  percent.<P>
It also showed Blair's personal approval rating had dropped  to minus 17 -- down from plus seven on the so-called "Baghdad  Bounce" in the immediate aftermath of the war.<P>
A second poll by MORI for the Sun newspaper showed a  quarter of all voters who backed Blair at the last election in  2001 have switched support to another political party.<P>
That poll cited worries about Blair's ability to improve  schools, hospitals and public transport. But the ICM poll,  conducted in the immediate aftermath of the death of Iraq  weapons scientist David Kelly last week, showed voters doubting  Blair's trustworthiness and competence.<P>
On a tour of Asia, Blair refused to comment directly on  Kelly, who bled to death of a slit wrist after being dragged  into a row between the government and the BBC over Iraq's  weapons of mass destruction and the case Blair made for war.<P>
But Blair insisted he was right to act against Iraq.<P>
"I believe what we did was right," he told students at  Tsinghua University in Beijing. "No, I don't regret it. I've no  doubt at all that Iraq was trying to develop these weapons."<P>
He justified the war by saying Saddam had to be disarmed of  banned weapons, but months after military action finished none  has been found.<P>
The failure to find weapons has already undermined the  government's credibility -- several ministers have quit since  the war saying Blair misled them over the case for action.<P>
The ICM poll showed the government's lead over the  opposition Conservatives has dropped to just two points from 12  points two months ago. Support for Labor was at 36 percent  compared to 34 percent for Conservatives.<P>
Blair skirted round students' questions about how he could  get through this political crisis and regain public trust.<P>
"What you have got to do as a political leader in a  democracy is you have got to say 'this is where I stand, that  is what I believe,"' he said. "If you believe that, you can  vote for me; if you don't believe it, you don't have to vote  for me."<P>
Blair's standing has not been the only casualty.<P>
Currency dealers cited the affair as the pound hit a  three-month low against the dollar and a six-week low against  the euro Monday. Sterling had recovered some ground by Tuesday  but the market remained jittery.<P>
And the British Broadcasting Corporation, which named Kelly  as its "principal source" for a damaging story questioning the  Blair's pre-war claim that Saddam could launch weapons at just  45 minutes' notice, was also under pressure.<P>
The Times newspaper said the first cracks were beginning to  show in the BBC, which has so far backed the man who reported  the story, Andrew Gilligan.<P>
But the BBC dismissed talk of a rift among its governors  and denied reports it had called an emergency management  meeting.
