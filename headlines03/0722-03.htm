<p>The American use of depleted uranium  munitions in both Persian Gulf wars has unleashed a toxic disaster that will eclipse the  Agent Orange tragedy of the Vietnam War,  a former top Army official said Monday  evening. <P>     Former Maj. Douglas Rokke, who was  director of the Army's depleted uranium  project, spoke to 125 people at the Buffalo  & Erie County Historical Society. The  Champaign, Ill., science professor was  brought here by the Western New York  Peace Center. <P>     "I am a warrior," the 54-year-old Vietnam War veteran began. "The sole purpose  of war is to kill and destroy. There are no  winners." <P>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="225">

</table></font>Dressed in sneakers, blue jeans and a  red polo shirt, Rokke fit the image of an  animated science professor, hair tousled,  adjusting his glasses and eager to impart his  findings to the next generation. <P>     If what he says is true, students will soon  have yet another chapter of heartbreaking  history to study in the schools. If he is  wrong, it will take years to disprove. <P>     Called to active duty in 1990, Rokke  said, he was assigned to develop procedures  for cleaning up uranium contamination after "they decided to use depleted uranium  munitions" in the war to expel Iraq from  Kuwait. <P>          "They didn't tell anybody what they were  doing. Why would they? Depleted uranium  munitions are the ultimate weapon. Each  round fired by an Abrams tank (represents)  10 pounds of solid uranium-238. The purpose of war is to kill and destroy." <P>     Rokke said his team in the gulf blew up  vehicles and structures with these munitions and then tested the wreckage for radioactive contamination. He said they  found that uranium dust is so fine that it  acts like a gas, seeping through the tiny  pores of protective masks. <P>     The United States blew up Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,  in Kuwait and on the Saudi Arabian border  in the first gulf war, Rokke said. As a precaution, American personnel were inoculated before entering the field, but "we were  told not to record it, and it's not in the soldiers' medical records." <P>     Uranium munitions were also used during the recent war in Iraq, he added. <P>     "It's like playing darts," he said, "except  you're playing with 10 pounds of solid uranium and it catches fire immediately. You  lose nearly 40 percent of the round in uranium dust. It contaminates air, water and  soil for all eternity." <P>     Rokke said an "infamous memo" from  the Los Alamos National Laboratory in  New Mexico on March 1, 1991, warned of  the "impact on the environment" of depleted uranium rounds and suggested that they  "may become politically unacceptable." Today he interprets the  memo as "a direct order to lie." <P>     The memo from Los Alamos -  where the first atomic bombs were  developed and tested during World  War II - prevented the military  from acknowledging the danger of  these munitions, Rokke said. <P>        "The United States used 375  tons in Gulf War I," Rokke said.  "My orders were to take care of  U.S. casualties and vehicles" that  had been hit by "friendly fire.' <P>     "Myself and my team members  started to get sick almost immediately. It started with respiratory  problems, then rashes." <P>       But the procedures developed  by his team were never implemented, Rokke said, despite a military  order of June 1991 to treat these  personnel. Recalling a wounded  friend who suffered tumors where  uranium shrapnel had been left in  his body, he said the authorities  found "no compelling evidence" of  a connection and refused to authorize removal of the shrapnel or  special treatment. <P>     In his own case, Rokke added,  his body has six times the amount  of uranium that usually requires  medical care but has received no  help or advice from the government. <P>     "The technology of war is out of  control," Rokke concluded. "We  don't have the ability to clean it up  (or) treat it. I'm a warrior, but my  conclusion is that war is obsolete.  A U.S. Department of Veterans  Affairs report says over 221,000 of  our sons and daughters are on permanent disability and over 10,000  dead - one-third of our Gulf War  I force. And they're coming back  sick right now."</p>
