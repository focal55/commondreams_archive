<p>MANCHESTER – A busy street and a phalanx of security separated President Bush from several hundred protesters, but that did not deter them from denouncing his leadership.

      PROTESTERS OFFER BUSH SOME ADVICE: NO MORE YEARS<br>
      US President George W. Bush prepares to speak at a Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce  luncheon in Manchester, New Hampshire, October 9, 2003. Bush, in a new push to defend the war on Iraq  in face of mounting doubts, said on Thursday he acted to protect Americans from 'madman' Saddam Hussein. REUTERS/Jason Reed <br>

  </table></font>Their views ranged in scope – the economy, environment, war in Iraq – but the protesters loudly rang the same theme: Bush should not serve another term.
<p>Lining Elm Street as Bush spoke Thursday at the Center of New Hampshire, the protesters claimed the president does not realize many Americans oppose his administration.
<p>“It’s invite only,” said Martha Yager of Bush’s speech before the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. “It shows us he can’t meet with ordinary people. How’s he supposed to know people don’t agree with him if he’s sheltered from them?”
<p>Yager, a coordinator for the Quaker organization American Friends Service Committee, handed out a two-sided open letter addressed to Bush. She wrote that his spending and tax priorities have hurt housing and health programs, and his policies have fueled unemployment.
<p>Yager said she would possibly change her mind on Bush if he repealed the tax cuts instituted by his administration and if wealthy Americans had a greater tax burden. 
<p>“I’m Quaker enough to believe anyone can change,” she said.
<p>But many others who joined Yager on the long stretch of sidewalk would not even consider giving the president a chance. For many, change will come only with a new administration.
<p>“Once we get a nominee, we will be behind him,” said Jerry Smeirson of Durham, a supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean. “(Democrats) would vote for Mickey Mouse over Bush.”
<p>Two men used bullhorns to incite the crowd to chant anti-Bush catchphrases, some spontaneous in nature, for much of the two-hour-long protest.
<p>“Lay off Bush, lay off Bush,” the crowd chanted. “Fire him, fire him,” they yelled moments later. “Go back to Texas” was another favorite.
<p>Don Foley and Idary Sann, representing Painters and Allied Trades District Council 35, held in place a 20-foot helium rat with a “Hello my name is George Bush” sign on its chest.
<p>“He never cares about the labor movement,” Sann said. “He doesn’t care about the economy. All he cares about is the war. That’s why his name is on this rat.”
<p>Foley, Sann and others from organized labor joined a divergent mass of people that mostly managed to strike the same chord. Despite occasionally drowning out one another’s voices or standing too closely together with placards, they found room for each other.
<p>They espoused abortion rights, health care reform, environmental protections and several Democratic presidential candidates, including Dean, U.S. Sens. Joseph Lieberman and John Kerry, and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich. 
<p>When asked if they officially represented the candidates’ campaigns, several protesters declined comment.
<p>Others denounced the war on Iraq – including Vietnam veterans – and others criticized Bush’s handling of the economy and unemployment. Aside from some occasional jabs at Bush supporters who drove past, the protest was civil and police reported no arrests.
<p>At least 10 people stood among the crowd and supported Bush.
<p>Caroline Kaluaitis of Hollis said her values mirror the president’s. She appreciates his support for business, she said, and believes the economy is turning for the better.
<p>Debbie Day of Nashua said Bush took office at a time of recession and then had to deal with the terrorists attacks of Sept. 11. She said Bush has handled these challenges well.
<p>“We have to stick by our president,” Day said. “I think he’s here for the people.”
