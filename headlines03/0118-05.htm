<p>Children in the Peninsula town of Belmont soon may find themselves 
attending Ralston Middle School Sponsored by Purina, eating lunch in Safeway 
Cafeteria and running laps around Nike Field.
<P>That's because the financial picture is so bleak in the Belmont-Redwood 
Shores School District that school trustees are giving serious thought to 
letting corporations slather their names on just about everything in sight -- 
for a price.
<P>It's a radical -- and unprecedented -- idea that school officials said 
could bring as much as $1 million to a district that would lose one-fifth of 
its $20 million annual budget under Gov. Gray Davis' proposed spending plan.
<P>"In times of economic difficulty, the community, the district and the 
parents are looking for creative ways to increase funding," said school board 
President Colleen You. "The school district needs to think outside the box." 
Or at least look to Jack in the Box.
<P>No other school district in the nation has gone to such lengths to fill its 
coffers. But some have considered less drastic measures.
<P>The Berkeley Unified School district considered and rejected a $100,000 
deal with Pepsi Co. in 1998 to allow the company exclusive rights to campus 
vending machines. The proposal also would have allowed Pepsi to erect a high-
tech scoreboard bearing its logo at the high school football field.
<P><b>OLD NAVY ON BUSES</b>
<P>And it wasn't that long ago that buses bearing the Old Navy logo ferried 
kids to school in San Francisco and San Mateo County.
<P>The possibility that media mogul Rupert Murdoch could slap his name on 
Benjamin Fox Middle School remains at least a few months away, but the debate 
has already started.
<P>Advocates said selling naming rights can be a terrific way to bring money 
to strapped districts. Critics argue it teaches kids that everything is for 
sale if the wad of cash is thick enough.
<P>School trustees launched a subcommittee Thursday that will outline 
potential guidelines for corporate sponsorships of schools, classrooms, 
libraries and gyms.
<P>The plan could be voted on by late February or early March.
<P>District administrators argue they need the cash to make up for a shrinking 
budget, which could lose $4 million under Davis' proposed budget.
<P>"We should certainly share in filling in the state's budget deficit, and we 
understand that," said Superintendent Anne E. Campbell. "But to take 20 
percent of our budget away absolutely guts our school district."
<P><b>NO FULL RIGHTS</b>
<P>School trustees rejected the idea of granting a corporation full naming 
rights to a school, so there won't be an Oracle Elementary.
<P>Instead, they favor incorporating a corporation's name into existing names, 
much like the college football Fiesta Bowl became the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
<P>"Because the community already identifies with the school names, the board 
is more interested in partnership or sponsorship ideas," said You.
<P>Although Professor Alex Molnar, director of the Education Policy Studies 
Laboratory at Arizona State University, can understand why a district might 
consider such a move, he thinks it's a bad idea.
<P>"I don't question the desperation, I question the value of the response," 
he said. "This is the not the way to address the district's fiscal crisis. The 
long-term effect is it undermines quality of the education by making their 
schools beholden to special interests."
<P>Proponents of the idea said they can live with any ill effects if it means 
keeping the district afloat.
<P>"The students will be exposed to corporate advertising all their life, so 
why not do it a little now to help fund their education," said Jeff Adams of 
School Force, the district's fund-raising foundation.
<P>Adams, who conceived of the idea, said the district would strike deals only 
with companies possessing images that would not undermine its educational 
mission.
<P>In other words, Budweiser and Marlboro need not apply.
