<p>BAISA, Iraq  - Guerrillas shot down a U.S.  transport helicopter near Baghdad Sunday carrying troops on a  recreation break, killing at least 15 in the bloodiest attack  on U.S. occupiers since Saddam Hussein was overthrown.
<p> 
			
The crippled Chinook came down in farmland near the village  of Baisa, south of Falluja, a stronghold of anti-U.S.  resistance 50 km (30 miles) west of Baghdad.<p>

							U.S. military helicopters circled above. Other helicopters  and U.S. Humvee vehicles were parked around the wreckage.<p> 
			
							A U.S. spokesman said two Chinooks had been heading for  Baghdad airport with troops on a rest and recreation break. He  said the downed helicopter, carrying 30 people including five  crew, had been "shot down by an unknown weapon."<p> 
			
							A witness in Falluja, Dawoud Suleiman, said: "There were  two American helicopters. They fired a missile at one and  missed, and then they hit the other, which crashed and caught  fire."<p> 
			
							Some Iraqis were jubilant. "The Americans are pigs. We will  hold a celebration because this helicopter went down -- a big  celebration," said wheat farmer Saadoun Jaralla near the crash  site. "The Americans are enemies of mankind."<p> 
			
							U.S. troops told journalists to leave the area and  confiscated their film as another military medical helicopter  with a red cross sign on its side landed, sending up clouds of  dust from the dry scrubland.<p> 
			
							It was the third time guerrillas had brought down a U.S.  military helicopter since President Bush declared major combat  over in Iraq on May 1.<p> 
			
							Bush himself had vowed Saturday to stand firm and said  leaving Iraq prematurely would strengthen the "terrorists" who  he blamed for recent deadly suicide attacks.<p>

							<b>DANCING ON THE WRECKAGE</b>
<p> 
			
In Falluja, residents said a roadside bomb had hit a convoy  of U.S. soldiers in civilian vehicles. At least one vehicle was  ablaze at the scene, where crowds gathered to celebrate and  shout anti-U.S. slogans. Television pictures showed a gleeful  youth wearing a U.S. Army helmet. Others danced on wreckage.<p> 
			
							Before the helicopter attack, 123 U.S. soldiers had died in  hostilities in Iraq in the past six months, including one  killed by an overnight roadside bomb blast in Baghdad and two  killed by a bomb in the northern city of Mosul the day before.<p> 
			
							In Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, residents said a roadside  bomb had exploded as a U.S. convoy passed, hitting a bus  carrying university students and wounding two women.<p> 
			
							Several of Iraq's neighbors were holding security talks in  Damascus over the weekend, mindful of recent American  assertions that Syria and Iran are not doing enough to prevent  foreign militants crossing into Iraq.<p> 
			
							But Iraq's interim foreign minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, said  he would not accept a belated invitation to attend.<p> 
			
							Officials at his ministry said Syria had been reluctant to  invite him because of misgivings about being seen to recognize  Iraq's U.S.-backed interim government.<p> 
			
							"It's impossible for us to make it, and that was their  intention," Zebari told Reuters Sunday. "We don't even know  what the agenda is."<p> 
			
							U.S. troops and Iraqi police had tightened security in  Baghdad and other cities over the weekend in response to rumors  that guerrillas planned another series of bombings.<p> 
			
							Many fearful parents kept their children out of schools in  the capital for the second day in a row, and some of the pupils  who did show up for class seemed terrified.<p> 
			
							Outside the Baghdad Middle School for Girls, one of three  armed guards said some pupils had wept when dropped off by  their parents. The deputy headmistress, who declined to give  her name, said only about a fifth of her 750 pupils had turned  up.<p> 
			
							"They're staying away because they're afraid of explosions.  We've tried to assure parents that it's safe," she said.
							<p> 
			
The rumors followed suicide bombings against the Red Cross  and three police stations Monday, which killed at least 35  people and prompted the United Nations and other aid agencies  to withdraw more foreign staff and review their operations in  Iraq.
