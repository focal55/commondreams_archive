<p> America's economic arm-twisting appeared to have paid off yesterday when Turkey indicated it would allow tens of thousands of US troops to deploy to open a northern front against the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>The agreement will cost the United States about $15bn (&#163;9.5bn) in loans and aid to bolster the Turkish economy.</p>
<p>The deal was reached after a six-hour meeting of a divided Turkish cabinet, which then sent the recommendation to the country's parliament. A vote in favor of the recommendation is expected to be passed today.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in which the agreement was squeezed out of Turkey by an increasingly frustrated Washington shows the way in which America and Britain, with help from Spain, are trying to build a majority within the UN Security Council to pass the second resolution on Iraq, tabled by them yesterday.</p>
<p>Officials talk of "intense diplomacy" &#150; that to gain the nine votes needed from a reluctant Security Council, the gloves are very much off and that in some cases efforts are being made to buy votes.</p>
<p>This includes telling countries that with a war against Iraq all but inevitable, they would be advised not to find themselves on the wrong side of the issue and that the future of important trade agreements could hang on their vote.</p>
<p>"It has been firm and pragmatic. The effort has been very much in reminding countries of their need to stand by their commitments," said one diplomat involved. "I think some of the non-permanent members [of the Security Council] are now wishing they had not applied to be members." The diplomat added: "[Economic inducements] are a factor. That is something that is happening between the capitals rather than at the UN. People are quite aware that this is an important vote ... and that it is an important part of their relationship with the US."</p>
<p>American displeasure can be crippling; in 1991, when the Security Council voted for the Gulf War, a non-permanent member, Yemen, voted against. Minutes later, a senior American diplomat told the Yemeni ambassador: "That was the most expensive 'No' vote you ever cast." Within three days, a US aid program of $70m to Yemen was stopped.</p>
<p>To be adopted, the resolution requires agreement from at least nine members of the Security Council, with none of the five permanent members using their veto. If the vote was taken today, the United States and Britain could be assured of only two other votes in favor, those of the non-permanent members Spain and Bulgaria. In response, diplomats and officials have been concentrating on trying to persuade the six "swing" non-permanent members of the council &#150; Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Angola, Cameroon and Chile. Syria and Germany, both non-permanent members, remain opposed to a second resolution.</p>
<p>Diplomats have been using a mixture of carrot and stick to get the votes they need. Over the weekend President George Bush telephoned Mexico's President, Vicente Fox, and Chile's President, Ricardo Lagos. He has previously spoken directly to the Pakistani leader, General Pervez Musharraf. At the same time, Tony Blair telephoned Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, and other council members have received telephone calls or visits from senior American officials.</p>
<p>The package to Turkey, in exchange for the right to deploy US troops, will include $5bn in aid and $10bn in loans to cushion the Turkish economy from the impact of any war. But America is keen to avoid having to offer such obvious inducements to other countries, conscious that the so-called coalition of the willing could quickly become the coalition of the bought.</p>
<p>"We think the case is strong on its merits," one senior administration official said. "We're looking to our friends to work with us to confront a common danger ... So the question doesn't arise in those terms."</p>
<p><b>How votes are being marshaled in the Security Council</b></p>
