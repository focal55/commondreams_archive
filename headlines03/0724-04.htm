<p>BAGHDAD - Three U.S. soldiers died in northern  Iraq Thursday in the second fatal attack on troops from the  101st Airborne Division since they tracked down and killed  Saddam Hussein's feared sons Uday and Qusay.
<P>
Washington had hoped the deaths of the brothers, killed on  Tuesday when 200 soldiers stormed their hideout in Mosul, would  end a guerrilla war that has claimed 44 U.S. lives since  President Bush declared major combat over on May 1.<P>
But with attacks continuing and many Iraqis still worried  the hated former ruling family may rise again, the Pentagon  prepared to publish grisly mortuary photos to try to convince  them Uday and Qusay really are dead.<P>
The U.S. military said the three soldiers from the 101st  died when their vehicles were ambushed close to Qayara, south  of Mosul, by gunmen who also fired rocket-propelled grenades.<P>

A television grab shows the smoldering wreckage of a U.S. military vehicle which blew up in a Baghdad street on July 24, 2003, an amateur cameraman who took the footage told Reuters. Local people said the explosion happened in the late afternoon in the capital's southern Dora district. It was not clear what caused the explosion.

</table></font>Wednesday, one soldier from the division was killed and  seven were wounded when two vehicles hit a mine on the  outskirts of the city, and in a separate ambush, a soldier from  the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment was killed west of Baghdad.<P>
Five U.S. soldiers have now been killed since the deaths of  Uday, 39, and Qusay, 37, Saddam's heir apparent. In all, 11  have died in the past week alone.<P>
U.S. officials had warned of the risk of revenge attacks,  and al-Jazeera television aired footage of masked men with  rifles and grenade launchers vowing vengeance. "We will make  them regret what they did to Uday and Qusay," one said.<P>
But Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of ground forces in  Iraq, said the killing of the brothers would demoralize  guerrillas and help tighten the noose around Saddam, who has a  $25 million price on his head.<P>
In Baghdad, two Iraqis were killed when U.S. troops opened  fire on a car that ignored instructions to stop, local  witnesses said. The car burst into flames leaving a charred  wreck. Two bodies were taken to hospital, residents said.<P>
GRIM PHOTOGRAPHS<P>
After decades of official lies, many Iraqis say they will  not believe Saddam's heirs are dead until they see photographs.<P>
"I don't know why, but if I don't see with my own eyes I  won't believe it," said Nairy Bedrosian, an Iraqi woman who  works at an Internet cafe.<P>
Ismail Zaiyer, editor-in-chief of Al Sabah, a newspaper  backed by the U.S.-led administration, said he would run a  special edition if pictures of the bodies were released. The  paper is not usually published Friday, the Muslim holy day.<P>
U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said proof  that Saddam's sons were dead might quell violence against U.S.  forces and quash fears Saddam could return to power.<P>
"We are going to make sure the Iraqi people believe us at  the end of the day," he said, adding Washington might release  "shocking" photographs despite the offence it might cause.<P>
The brothers were tracked down after a tip-off from an  Iraqi informant expected to get the two $15 million rewards  offered for information leading to their death or capture.<P>
They were holed up in a Mosul villa with a bodyguard and  Qusay's teenage son, U.S. officials say. Armed only with AK-47  assault rifles, they wounded four American soldiers and held  out for hours against a devastating array of U.S. firepower,  including attack helicopters, heavy machineguns and grenades.<P>
U.S. commanders said Uday, Qusay and the bodyguard were  eventually killed when the house was blasted with 10 anti-tank  missiles. The teen-ager made a last stand but was shot as  troops raced up the stairs after finally getting into the  villa.<P>
The deaths of the brothers, and the capture of a cousin of  Saddam who led the elite Special Republican Guard, brought to  37 the number of Iraqis on a list of 55 most-wanted fugitives  to have been caught or killed since Saddam was toppled.<P>
France, which led opposition to the war that toppled  Saddam, welcomed the killing of Uday and Qusay but said it  could spark revenge attacks. Foreign Minister Dominique de  Villepin said the United Nations should take over peacekeeping.<P>
"The death of the two sons who were the future of Saddam  Hussein's regime marks the end of an era and we can hope that  with the capture of Saddam himself the page will be  definitively turned," he said.
<P>
"One can also imagine resistance ... intensifying. That's  why for France the key is to press ahead with the political  process."
