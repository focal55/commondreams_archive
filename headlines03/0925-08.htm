<p>BAGHDAD - The murder of a U.S.-backed Iraqi  leader, a bombing at a Baghdad hotel and an attack on U.S.  soldiers deepened Washington's troubles on Thursday as it tried  to enlist the world's help to rebuild Iraq.<P>
Concern over security led the United Nations to announce it  was scaling back its international staff, dealing a fresh blow  to U.S. claims the situation was under control in Iraq. U.N.  offices in Baghdad have twice come under attack.<P>
But in New York, Secretary of State Colin Powell was upbeat  about a new Security Council resolution on rebuilding Iraq,  saying major powers were moving closer.<P>
"I am pleased, and I think my colleagues on the P5 are  pleased, that we have seen some convergence of views with  respect to the new resolution," Powell told reporters after  lunch at U.N. headquarters with foreign ministers of the other  four permanent Security Council members -- Russia, China,  France and Britain.<P>
In what was another black day for U.S.-led occupying forces  and their Iraqi supporters, Akila al-Hashemi, one of three  women on Washington's handpicked Iraqi Governing Council, died  from wounds suffered in an gun attack five days ago.<P>
"Today the people of Iraq have lost a courageous champion  and pioneer for the cause of freedom and democracy," the U.S.  governor of Iraq, Paul Bremer, said in a statement.<P>
Powell also paid tribute Hashemi: "She gave her life so  that they (the Iraqi people) could have a better future."<P>
"Those who murdered her were attacking the efforts to  create a peaceful, democratic, modern Iraq," White House  spokesman Scott McClellan said. "They must and will not be  allowed to succeed."<P>
Eight soldiers were wounded, three seriously, when their  convoy came under attack in the northern city of Mosul, and a  Somalian security guard was killed at the Baghdad hotel housing  journalists from U.S. television network NBC.<P>
Guerrillas opposed to the U.S.-led occupation have targeted  Westerners, Iraqis cooperating with Bremer's administration,  U.S. and British soldiers. They have also tried to sabotage the  sprawling infrastructure of a country which holds the second  largest oil reserves in the world.<P>
Guerrilla attacks have killed 79 U.S. soldiers in Iraq  since Washington declared major combat over on May 1. Many more  have been wounded.<P>
U.N. SECURITY WORRIES<P>
U.N. Fred Eckhard said 42 international staff remained in  Baghdad and 44 in northern Iraq, down from about a hundred,  numbers he expected to "shrink further over the next few days."<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has agonized over  security since a suicide bombing of U.N. Baghdad headquarters  last month killed 22 people, including mission head Sergio  Vieira de Mello.<P>
U.N. sources said they could not rule out an eventual  reduction of staff to as few as one or two international staff.<P>
The decision was a clear setback to Bush's efforts to  expand the U.N. role in Iraqi reconstruction in order to  persuade more nations to contribute cash and troops.<P>
The White House responded quickly by saying the United  Nations still had a vital role to play in Iraq.<P>
Thursday's attacks occurred ahead of a report expected to  lay open Bush to further criticism over his main justification  for launching the invasion of Iraq in the face of objections  from traditional allies, France and Germany, and of Russia.<P>
A senior U.S. official said the eagerly awaited U.S. report  was expected to say there was no proof Iraq had chemical or  biological weapons.<P>
Such a report would provide powerful ammunition for the  rising number of critics to attack Bush and his closest ally,  British Prime Minister Tony Blair, over their decision to  invade Iraq on the premise that former Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein's weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat.<P>
U.S. forces have been searching for such weapons in Iraq  for more than five months. None have so far been found.<P>
France and Germany want a swifter handover of power to  Iraqis as a condition for supporting Washington's efforts. The  United States says it would be rash to hurry the process.<P>
In his address to the U.N. General Assembly, Russian  President Vladimir Putin avoided the Iraqi dispute, focusing on  the need for tougher action to fight terror acts, whether they  are in Baghdad or Russia's rebel Chechnya.<P>
Some Governing Council members have also pressed for a  quick return to Iraqi self-rule. Members of Iraq's delegation  at the United Nations denied any rift with the United States,  but said they hoped a new constitution could be ready by May,  paving the way for democratic elections and self-government.
