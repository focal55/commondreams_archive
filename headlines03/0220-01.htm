<p> The Bush administration's determination to keep to a tight timetable that 
would see its forces ready to go to war against Iraq by early March is in danger 
of coming unstuck. 
<P>Plans to open a northern front against Iraq - seen as vital to ensure a pincer 
movement against Baghdad - were looking shaky last night as Turkey resisted an 
ultimatum from Washington to accept US troop deployments or forfeit a multi-billion 
dollar compensation package.
<P>The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, warned Ankara it had been presented 
with a final financial offer - believed to exceed $26bn - and that a response 
was needed. "There comes a moment when plans must be made, decisions must be made, 
and it cannot stretch on indefinitely," he said.
<P>The trouble with Turkey is compounded by fresh diplomatic hurdles. The US and 
Britain have been forced to postpone until next week the publication of a second 
UN resolution designed to marshal support within the security council for military 
action.
<P>The resolution will now not be put to a vote before early March, following 
another report by the chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix. British jitters over 
persuading the UN to back war were underlined yesterday when officials insisted 
that they would press ahead with military action even if the resolution were heavily 
defeated.
<P>The likelihood of such a defeat has deepened with the open rift between the 
US and France and Germany which was again on display yesterday. The US secretary 
of state, Colin Powell, in effect accused the two European countries of being 
too cowardly to go to war.
<P>"It is not a satisfactory solution to continue inspections indefinitely because 
certain countries are afraid of upholding their responsibility to impose the will 
of the international community," Mr Powell said.
<P>But the most urgent problem facing the US in its push to war is Turkey, traditionally 
a staunch Nato partner. The Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, indicated yesterday 
there was little sign of the impasse being resolved quickly, saying there were 
no plans for a parliamentary vote this week on allowing US troops on Turkish soil.
<P>Failure by Turkey to open its bases to American troops would mean that US transport 
ships carrying thousands of servicemen and essential equipment would have to be 
re-routed to the Gulf or elsewhere. Any diversionary attack against Baghdad from 
the north may then have to be scaled back dramatically. The block on US servicemen 
might also leave the Kurds vulnerable to an Iraqi counter-attack.
<P>As a fallback position, US special service troops and Kurdish fighters have 
been upgrading three airstrips in northern Iraq which might be used as advance 
supply positions. But the US would be denied the modern infrastructure of the 
main Turkish airbases such as Incirlik, Batman and Diyarbakir.
<P>The latest opinion polls in Turkey suggest that 90% of the electorate is opposed 
to war.
<P>Turkey's resistance to participating in an unpopular war, which it fears would 
undermine its weakened economy, has been bolstered by the strength of anti-war 
protests around the world last weekend.
<P>The US defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, admitted the lack of cooperation 
was causing some discomfort: "Obviously, the more assistance one gets the easier 
it is. The less assistance one gets, the more difficult it is." He predicted an 
eventual Turkish climbdown.
<P>The disarray over military planning will boost the Iraqi government, which 
has already been buoyed by Mr Blix's last report as well as by worldwide anti-war 
demonstrations. UN officials said yesterday that the Iraqi government has been 
emboldened to the point where it sees no urgency in meeting the weapons inspectors' 
call for deeper cooperation.
<P>In a move which suggests that the inspectors are taking a tougher stance, Mr 
Blix has decided to ask Iraq to destroy its al-Samoud 2 missiles, diplomatic sources 
said last night.
<P>Iraq's response to the demand will be a crucial test of the inspection system.
<P>UN officials in Baghdad also said yesterday that they had detected a disturbing 
shift in Baghdad's attitude in the last few days. They say the protests have encouraged 
Iraq to believe it can turn the divisions in the security council to its advantage, 
a strategy that could stall the speedy progress sought by Mr Blix, who is expected 
to make a further report to the security council around March 6 rather than, as 
suggested by Washington and London, on February 28.
