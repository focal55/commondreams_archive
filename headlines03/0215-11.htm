<p>NEW HAVEN, Conn. --
	

	 Thousands of Connecticut activists jumped on a "Peace Train" that glided out of Union Station Saturday morning, bound for a protest in New York City against a war with Iraq. <p>Bruce Martin, from the Milford-based Promoting Enduring Peace, said a coalition of Connecticut peace groups filled 17 New York City-bound passenger train cars with almost 2,000 people. <p>Eighteen chartered buses from Hartford, Litchfield, Middletown and Willimantic also carried Connecticut protesters to the city. <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>Standing in the doorway of a train car poised to leave, State Rep. Bill Dyson, D-New Haven, said he was going to the rally to voice his dissatisfaction with the way Washington is handling the situation with Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein. <p>"I am adamantly opposed to war," he said. "And I think the high terrorist alert is part and parcel of gearing up for war. They're trying to scare the hell out of everyone and create hysteria." <p>Protestors carried signs aboard the train reading "No War for Oil," "Not in Our Name," and "War is Old." On the platform, they chanted, "President Bush has got to go!" <p>Demonstrators walked from Grand Central Station to the U.N. headquarters where they congregated against the backdrop of flags from the 191 U.N. member nations. <p>The scene in Manhattan was anything but calm, protesters said. <p>"Fifty-first street is just a crush of bodies," said Wade Linebaugh, 15, of Chester. "The energy is insane." <p>Richard Platt, 69, of Milford, said he believes pre-emptive war is un-American. <p>"While Saddam has terrible weapons and may be an awful person, he hasn't made any specific threats to anyone," said Platt, a member of the Unitarian Society of New Haven and a veteran of the armed services. <p>Anti-war protests were held worldwide Saturday, with at least a million people turning out in both London and Rome. Crowds also congregated in Australia, Germany, France, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, South Africa, Austria, Bangladesh, and other places. <p>Participating in anti-war activities was a good thing for all Americans to do, said Brian Festa, a 53-year-old high school teacher from Branford. <p>"I haven't met anyone who totally supports a war in Iraq," he said. "They're either directly opposed to it, or they're so-so. I don't believe we're in any imminent danger from Saddam, whereas the opposite is true with North Korea." <p>He said he hopes the peace rally in New York puts pressure on Congress. <p>"I think the turnout will be a wake-up call to them," he said. <p>"Based on what President Bush had said so far, I think this would be an unjust war," said Erin Johnson, 19, of Branford, a student from Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass. "And I don't there's enough reason to go to war." <p>Linebaugh said he traveled on the Peace Train with friends because he feels his opinion is important. <p>"I think what Bush is doing is wrong," he said. "Changing the regime in Iraq and meddling in other people's business. It's just wrong."
