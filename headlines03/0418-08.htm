<p>A Keizer parent is asking the courts to rule that forcing children to watch Channel One television during school hours is unconstitutional.
<p>Gary Boyes filed a lawsuit against the Salem-Keizer School District Thursday in Marion County Circuit Court.
<p>“They’re literally selling advertising access to everyone’s children in the schools,” Boyes said.
<p>Salem-Keizer Superintendent Kay Baker said she had not seen the lawsuit Thursday.

<p>“We’re going to review the document and the issues in the suit and see where we stand and we’ll respond accordingly,” Baker said.
<p>Boyes made headlines last fall after protesting the school district’s contract with Pepsi, which gives the beverage giant exclusive pouring rights in Salem-Keizer schools.
<p>He became interested in the issue of commercialization in schools after his daughter’s plan to sell bottled water as a fund-raiser for the West Salem High School cheerleading team was nixed because it violated the Pepsi agreement.
<p>Boyes also has a daughter at Walker Middle School and a son at North Salem High School.

<p>He said he took the issue of Channel One to court because his children lose at least five full days of school per year watching Channel One and are subjected to ads for inappropriate and unhealthy products such as junk food and violent movies.

<p>Boyes shared his concerns with the school board at two recent board meetings but received no response, he said.

<p>“Requiring students to participate in group viewings of private commercials is a violation of the Oregon Constitution’s prohibition against involuntary servitude,” he stated in the lawsuit.

<p>Boyes is asking for an injunction prohibiting the district from forcing children to watch the program.
<p>He also contends that Channel One contracts should be subject to public bid laws.

<p>Boyes is working in conjunction with <a href="http://www.commercialalert.org/" target="_new">Commercial Alert</a>, a national nonprofit organization, founded by Ralph Nader, which opposes commercialism in schools. 

<p>Commercial Alert spokesman Gary Ruskin said Boyes’ lawsuit is the only one of its kind in the nation.

<p>“Gary is a national leader in the effort to remove commercialism from the schools,” Ruskin said.

<p>Channel One has been controversial in many places. It has been removed from some school districts after complaints from parents.

<p>Channel One operates in 12 Salem-Keizer schools: McKay, McNary, Sprague and North Salem high schools and Crossler, Houck, Judson, Leslie, Parrish, Stephens, Waldo and Walker middle schools.

<p>Each school contracts individually with the company. The company gives the schools unlimited use of its television equipment in exchange for an agreement to show the program each day.

<p>School board chairman Steve Chambers said he advocated for Channel One in the early 1990s, when many Salem-Keizer schools signed on.

<p>A retired North Salem High School history teacher, Chambers said many students had no source of news outside of school. 

<p>“My contention was that it got information to kids who were not otherwise getting it,” he said. “I figured the advertisements were a small price to pay.”

<p>Chambers said most Salem-Keizer high schools added 10 minutes to the school day to accommodate Channel One.

<p>At McNary High School, the televisions also are used by the school’s video production class, which tapes a daily announcement and other productions, Principal John Bohlander said.

<p>Bohlander said the school has not received any complaints about Channel One from parents or students.

<p>The show is broadcast at the beginning of each social studies class because there is a current-events component, he said.

<p>“It’s not like this is entirely time that could have been used for instruction,” Bohlander said. “Teachers are taking roll during that time.”

<p>Baker said the situation creates a real dilemma for schools.

<p>“Should you take the free equipment with the strings attached?” she asked. “Or should you not have those options available for kids?”

<p>South Salem High School was the first in the district to sign up for Channel One, in 1991. The school did not renew its contract for this school year, Principal Kris Olsen said.

<p>“We went to the site council and staff and found overwhelming support not to. We really wanted that 12 to 15 minutes a day back for instructional time,” he said. Channel One immediately removed the school’s televisions.

<p>Teachers miss having the technology but still support the decision, Olsen said.

<p>West Salem High is the only other Salem-Keizer high school without Channel One. There, the school district has paid for a full media cabinet in each classroom containing a TV, VCR and DVD player, and overhead projector.

<p>Channel One is broadcast to about 8 million children in about 12,000 schools across the country. It shows 10 minutes of programming and two minutes of commercials each day.
