<p>Environmental groups asked a federal court Tuesday to halt a rule that 
they say would weaken the "dolphin safe" label on canned tuna and dramatically 
increase the number of deaths among the ocean mammals.
<P>For 12 years, the label had guaranteed consumers that the tuna was caught 
by nets that did not surround and harm dolphins. But in December, a new rule 
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration applied the label to 
tuna captured in encircling nets.
<P>The <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/" target="_new">Earth Island Institute</a> and six other groups asked the U.S. District 
Court in San Francisco for an injunction to the new rule, arguing that science 
-- and not trade concerns -- should guide environmental policy.
<P>The fishing practice allowed by the new rule continues to kill, injure and 
harass thousands of dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean every year, 
they say. If the new rule remains in effect, it will open the U.S. market to 
supplies from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Vanuatu, where vessels chase 
down and encircle dolphins to catch the tuna that swim with them.
<P>If the tougher label survives, however, the Mexican government has 
threatened to bring barrier-to-trade charges against the United States before 
the World Trade Organization.
<P>Stanley Minasian, president of the Animal Fund in San Francisco, a 
plaintiff, said the new federal rule would remove dolphin protections.
<P>"If the Latin Americans and the Bush administration have their way, 
thousands of dolphins will die every year," Minasian said. "They get caught up 
in the nets, and they drown. The mothers and babies get separated, and the 
babies die."
<P>The environmentalists' suit names the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, whose new rule said the encircling fishing practice would no 
longer disqualify tuna from a "dolphin safe" label as long as independent on-
vessel observers certified that no dolphins had been killed or injured during 
a catch.
<P>William Hogarth, head of the oceanic administration, said there wasn't 
enough evidence to show that the encircling nets had a significant role in the 
continued decline of some dolphin species.
<P>In response to the suit, Connie Barclay, a spokeswoman for the oceanic 
administration, said, "We will review their brief and submit our own comments 
to the judge."
<P>The case goes before Judge Thelton Henderson, who over the last decade has 
generally ruled in favor of dolphin protections. He ruled in 1999 that the 
government couldn't weaken the criteria for the label in the absence of study 
showing that the fishing practice wasn't harming dolphins.
<P>Armed with recent footage taken off the Galapagos Islands showing 50 or 
more dolphins dead or dying in a purse-seine net, the environmental groups say 
they don't trust the observers, many of whom are pressured by the fishermen. 
The groups also argue that the observers can't measure stress or separation of 
mothers and babies.
<P>They cite a 100-page study prepared by the Southwest Fisheries Science 
Center in La Jolla (San Diego County), part of the Commerce Department, 
stating concerns that the "practice of chasing and encircling dolphins somehow 
is adversely affecting the ability of these depleted stocks to recover."
<P>Three weeks before Hogarth issued the new rule, Secretary of State Colin 
Powell sent a letter asking him to carefully review the evidence before making 
his decision.
<P>The Department of State has an interest in this matter, Powell wrote, 
because the finding would profoundly affect its role as leader in an 
international agreement among 14 nations and the European Union that has been 
very successful in reducing dolphin deaths.
<P>State Department officials didn't return requests for a comment on Powell's 
letter.</p>
