750 nude women form a heart around the words 'No War' on a hillside near the town of Byron bay, 700 kilometers (435 miles) north of Sydney, Australia, Saturday, Feb. 8, 2003. The women said they wanted to send Prime Minister John Howard a message to recall Australian troops from the middle east. (AP Photo/Icon Images) <br>

   More than 750 female protesters shed their clothing during the protest, lying naked end to end on a grassy knoll on a private property, to form a heart shape around the words &quot;No War&quot; for an aerial photograph.<p>
   Australia has sent troops and approved an RAAF fighter squadron deployment to join US and British forces in the Gulf preparing for a possible war in Iraq.<p>
   But it has yet to publicly commit itself to joining any UN-approved or US-led military action in Iraq.<p>
   Today's larger-than-expected turnout for the 'Disrobe to Disarm', prompted by a similar protest in the US, even surprised organisers.<p>
   &quot;I was completely overwhelmed,&quot; Australian jazz and blues singer Grace Knight, who led organisational efforts for today's protest, told AAP.<p>
   &quot;I needed at the very least 67 women and I prayed for 250, and we got more than 750.<p>
   &quot;What that tells me is that 750 women came and took the opportunity to get quite uncomfortable in a field - I know I felt quite uncomfortable - because we thought that was the only way we could get the federal government's attention.&quot;<p>

</table>The former Eurogliders lead singer, speaking while rushing to catch a flight to Tasmania where she has a gig this weekend, said the nude protest group included babies, teenagers and elderly women.<p>
   &quot;There were 80-year-old women there whose husbands were Vietnam war veterans,&quot; Knight said.<p>
   &quot;We wanted to spell out a clear message very quickly, so we used the words: 'No War'.&quot;<p>
   She said that with hundreds choosing to bare all in the protest, and that it was limited only to women, demonstrated that many Australians were &quot;extremely angry and frustrated&quot; about involvement in a possible war on Iraq.<p>
   Australian comedienne, Mandy Nolan, assumed the role of 'Mistress of Undressing', synchronising the protesters and helping them through the disrobing protest, which was done in seconds, Knight said.<p>
   Easing participants' nudity nerves with humour, Nolan dubbed the event the &quot;bush against Bush&quot; protest.<p>
   One middle-aged woman had the words &quot;Bare it all for the boys Down Under&quot; written down her back.<p>
&quot;The protest was not visible to any other public area, we were there to ensure the women were not bothered by outsiders,&quot; a local policeman told AAP.<p>

</table></font></font>Smaller anti-war protests were staged elsewhere on in NSW and Queensland today.<p>
   The Byron Bay protest was one of a number of similar nude protests around the world, in a climate of increasing anti-war sentiment.<p>
   Late yesterday (AEDT), about 30 women scurried into the heart of Central Park in New York City, disrobing amid steady snowfall to display their deep misgivings about war.<p>
   In shivering temperatures, the American women used their naked bodies to spell out the words, &quot;No Bush&quot;.
   <p>
   Prime Minister John Howard left Sydney on Saturday on a week-long trip in which he plans to meet with US President George Bush as well as UN, British and Indonesian leaders.
