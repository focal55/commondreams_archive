<p>OLEAN &#151; Hours before U.S. forces began the war in Iraq, Jessica Morgan, Molly Brechtel and Sister Anne McCarthy joined 16 others for an anti-war protest at the federal building in Erie, Pa.
<p> They staged a sit-in in the lobby of the building and everyone was arrested. That night U.S. bombs rained down on Iraqi targets.
<p> What good did protesting the war do? Was it worth getting arrested?
<p> Sister McCarthy, Ms. Morgan and Ms. Brechtel discussed that question Wednesday in the John J. Ash Community Center. They were invited to Olean by the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/oleanpeace/oacindex.html" target="_new">Olean Area Coalition for Peace and Justice</a> as part of its continuing series, Reflections on the First Amendment. Thirty-five people attended.
<p> Sister McCarthy is director of the Center for Social Concern at Gannon University in Erie. She&#146;s also former national director of Pax Christi USA, the Catholic peace organization. Ms. Morgan and Ms. Brechtel are students at Gannon.
<p> Ms. Morgan said she questioned the value of her protest and subsequent arrest in the days after the war began.
<p> &#147;And that&#146;s why I come back to my faith and my belief that there is love within us all,&#148; she said. &#147;I feel as though that&#146;s who I am and what I&#146;m supposed to do.&#148;
<p> She said she felt compelled by her faith to speak out against the war and in the end get arrested at the sit-in.
<p> &#147;We did not believe business should be going on as usual at the federal building as things weren&#146;t business as usual in Iraq,&#148; she said.
<p> Ms. Morgan said the protest did have an impact in Erie and made people aware there was opposition to the war. It gave them a way to act against war in a nonviolent manner. Prior to the sit-in, Ms. Morgan and other war protesters at Gannon advocated for peace on campus and in letters to the editor. 
<p> &#147;It was effective because I had people with me who wouldn&#146;t have been with me if we hadn&#146;t started months in advance,&#148; she said.
<p> Ms. Brechtel said protesting the war was what her faith and conscience required.
<p> &#147;Civil disobedience for us was a final attempt for us to be heard,&#148; she said. &#147;I honestly can&#146;t say that I felt we could stop the war. For me, it was more about being able to live with myself.&#148;
<p> Sister McCarthy said the protests against the war in Iraq are the latest in a long line of protests against evil. She said the pursuit of peace is always worth the sacrifice.
<p> &#147;It will take a long time and many different actions&#148; for peace to prevail, she said.
<p> She noted that every day for years protesters gathered outside of the South African embassy in the U.S. to protest apartheid. 
<p> Apartheid was a system of institutional racism supported by the white South African government which denied blacks basic rights.
<p> &#147;Apartheid fell when it looked like it wouldn&#146;t,&#148; Sister McCarthy said.
<p> Sister McCarthy said nonviolence isn&#146;t just a protest tactic, it&#146;s also a way of life. She said every religion embraces nonviolence and teaches it as an alternative to fear and violence.
<p> &#147;The motivation for nonviolence is love. The motivation for violence is fear,&#148; she said. 
<p> She summed up the impulse to resort to violence as: &#147;I fear you hurting me, so I will hurt you worse.&#148;
<p> Audience member Winifred Owens said stopping violence in the world begins at home.
<p> &#147;Stop violence in your own life,&#148; she said. &#147;Stop violence where you can.&#148;
<p> Francoise Krampf of Hinsdale said those opposed to war have a moral obligation to speak out against policies which encourage violence.
<p> &#147;We have a duty to inform our neighbors,&#148; she said.
<p> She also said the power of prayer should never be underestimated.
<p> Audience member John Walters said he hopes the advocates for peace will prevail. But he said he believes the military-industrial complex in the U.S. has too much power to be stopped by nonviolent protest.
<p> &#147;The problem is they don&#146;t fear you, they don&#146;t fear anything,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#146;m so afraid that it&#146;s eventually going to come down to a very, very violent action.&#148;
