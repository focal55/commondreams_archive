<p>The Rev. Daniel Berrigan - poet, playwright, teacher and activist - returns to Ithaca this weekend in celebration of peace activism. The weekend of events, free and open to the public, will include poetry, music and political discussion. 
<p>Cornell's Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy (CRESP) coordinated the festival as a means to raise awareness about peace and to reflect on Berrigan's lifelong strides to promote social justice. The weekend's title, "<a href="http://www.sas.cornell.edu/CRESP/berrigan/" target="_new">Celebrating Peace Activism: America is Still Hard to Find</a>," takes its name from "The America is Hard to Find Weekend," the April 1970 festival organized by Berrigan and others in protest of the Vietnam War. 
<p>Anke Wessels, executive director of CRESP, said the idea for this weekend's event came to her last fall when the government began discussing preemptive strikes against Iraq. As his commitment to non-violent action continues to inspire activists, she thought inviting Father Berrigan could help raise consciousness and inspire a stance for peace. 
<p>"He is known for speaking and acting from his religious commitment to nonviolence at a time, in the late 1960s, when it was dangerous to do so," Wessels says. "We are thrilled to have him return to campus and share his views about the current political climate, since our nation is again engaged in a war for the sake of improving national security, and those who protest this strategy are often criticized as un-American."

</table></font>Following a teaching position at LeMoyne College in Syracuse, Berrigan came to Ithaca in 1967 to accept a job at Cornell.
<p>As associate director of Cornell United Religious Work (CURW), he worked closely with the late Rev. W. Jack Lewis, who served as the organization's director from 1965 to 1981. Lewis co-founded CURW as a non-denominational outlet to promote peace and social justice. 
<p>A Jesuit, Berrigan was the first Catholic priest hired as associate director.
<p>During his three years at Cornell, Berrigan became a major force in the anti-Vietnam War movement. He taught classes combining religious history and nonviolence. While protesting on Pentagon grounds, he was arrested with other activists in October 1967. In early 1968, he traveled to Hanoi with historian Howard Zinn to aid in the release of three American POWs. 
<p>One early morning in May of 1968, he and a group of eight others - which included his late brother Philip - broke into a Selective Service office in Catonsville, Maryland and ransacked draft files. Later known as the "Catonsville Nine," they stole 378 draft cards, piled them up in the parking lot, doused them with homemade napalm and burned them while awaiting arrest. 
<p>Their civil disobedience immediately inspired the burning of draft cards around the country.
<p>On April 9, 1970, the day appeals for the three-and-a-half year prison sentence he received for his involvement at Catonsville expired, Berrigan vanished. Usually viewing arrest as a statement of resistance, he chose to go underground, referring to himself as a "fugitive from injustice." 
<p>In a Village Voice interview a few weeks after disappearing, he explained his reasons for evading prison. "I wanted to confront the mythology of the good guy whose goodness depends on his willingness to go to jail; the sort of idea that spread with the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King. All that's over now. The important thing is to keep working."
<p>Jack Goldman, owner of The Bookery, was a Cornell graduate student at the time. He founded The Office and Glad Day Press, which published and distributed Vietnam literature and eventually served as a headquarters for Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). He and Berrigan became friends and collaborated on a short-lived magazine called Year One. Goldman was among the network of activists who covertly passed Berrigan around various homes in Upstate New York "like a baton."
<p>Goldman also chaired the organizing committee of the original The America is Hard to Find Weekend. The event, he said, emerged from a "late-night" discussion with Berrigan and was named after Berrigan's poem "America is Hard to Find."
<p>Expecting Berrigan to resurface, the FBI set up a special office on Cornell's campus. While planning the event, the FBI questioned Goldman on Berrigan's whereabouts. He told them he didn't know anything. "Which at the time was literally true," he said.
<p>Despite the risk of capture, Berrigan attended the festival. The FBI stood by, an obvious presence.
<p>"The FBI agents all stood out," recalls Goldman, "because they were all in disguise. Some of them were wearing saramis. [laughter] They thought this would make them look like hippies or something. It was really funny." 
<p>Realizing it would be impossible to avoid a run-in with the FBI for an entire weekend, Goldman said it was decided to get Berrigan as far away from the event as quickly as possible.
<p>"It was a bit of a performance," he says, calling the escape plan a "caper." Hidden under a life-sized mask borrowed from the Bread and Puppet Theater, who performed that weekend, Berrigan was whisked to a waiting car. The FBI quickly responded, probably tipped off, Goldman says, when someone dimmed the lights. Speeding after their man on the run, Berrigan foiled the FBI by jumping into another accomplice car that took him to New York City. After four months of dodging authorities, FBI agents disguised as bird watchers nabbed Berrigan while he vacationed on Block Island.
<p> <b>Post-Vietnam Civil Disobedience</b>
<p> In the1980s, Berrigan protested against U.S. intervention in Central America. He also participated in direct actions against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Berrigan, his brother and six others (the "Plowshares Eight") were arrested at General Electric's plant in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania for dumping blood on warheads manufactured there. 
<p>Fred A. Wilcox, a writing professor at Ithaca College, met the Berrigans shortly after the King of Prussia protest. His book Uncommon Martyrs: How the Berrigans and Others Are Turning Swords into Plowshares details that and other plowshare actions. In his view, the Berrigans never fit the "dreamy-eyed" peace activist stereotype. Their selfless devotion, he said, has made lasting contributions to social justice and he believes their dedication has even affected recent anti-war policies of the Catholic Church. 
<p>Noting that he's not religious himself, Wilcox says the Berrigans never used the peace movement to push their faith. What mattered most - and still matters now, he says - is "not what you say or what you profess to believe in, but what you actually do, how you live your life and the commitments you'll make to peace and social justice."
<p>What they did preach, though, Wilcox says, is what they learned both from church and school. "And that was: Though shalt not kill. Period. That's it." 
<p> <b>Nobel Contender</b>
<p> Berrigan has been nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize. He and his brother were both nominated in 1998 by Mairead Corrigan Maguire, the Irish Nobel Peace Laureate of 1976. Scores of books have been written about the Berrigans and films have documented their work and their lives. Cornell and Yale possess archives.
<p>Sarah Elbert, a history professor at Binghamton University, was a graduate student and activist at Cornell who knew Berrigan well. Elbert agrees honor and appreciation are due, but, she says, "the problem with many heroes and heroines that we all have is that we can't emulate them. They're too big. We can't do what they do."
<p>To her, Berrigan is a hero because of his weaknesses as much as his strengths.
<p>"I hope he never becomes canonized," she says. "It takes away from the idea that he's an imperfect human being who celebrated his imperfections." 
<p> <b>A Weekend of Peace and Reflection</b>
<p> "Father Berrigan boldly demonstrated the kind of commitment and integrity he saw as inherent to a religiously principled stand for peace," says Wessels. "My hope is that he will be an inspiration to a new generation of citizens seeking to create peace around them and in the world. With this background, the events of the weekend have particular relevance." 
<p>Wilcox says this weekend's events are "more than relevant. It's absolutely imperative that we invite people like Dan here so that we can learn from him, so that we can show him our appreciation." 
<p>About Berrigan's return to Ithaca for America is Still Hard to Find, Goldman says, "Well, we can always hope that he'll spark a revitalization of some kind of protests. We certainly, obviously, need one again, more than ever." 
<p>Elbert sees Berrigan's return as a sign of a resurging peace movement. "People again are being repressed, are being murdered; that once again, if you can find Ithaca, you can find America," she said. 
<p>The Bread and Puppet Theater are returning to perform. Other highlights of the festival's events include live music by Michelle Shocked and a showing of the documentary This is What Democracy Looks Like. Another documentary that chronicles the work of Berrigan and Lewis will also be shown. The weekend closes Sunday morning with a sermon given by Berrigan at Sage Chapel at Cornell.
