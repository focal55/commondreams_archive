<p>Even as U.S. troops inch toward the Persian Gulf for a possible war with 
Iraq, anti-war activists say it can be difficult to rally outrage or media 
interest back home. So a group of Marin County women has resorted to the 
ultimate attention grabber: getting nude.

</table></font>Since November, more than 200 women -- calling themselves Unreasonable 
Women Baring Witness -- have used their naked bodies to spell out anti-war 
slogans on three sites: a Marin beach, ball field and dung-laden pasture.
<P>While some may say the gesture trivializes and distracts from the gravity 
of the anti-war message, Unreasonable Women organizer Donna Sheehan said 
desperate times . . .
<P>"It got your attention, didn't it?" joked Sheehan of Marshall, who said she 
doesn't even go into the kitchen without a robe on.
<P>Longtime activists say the Unreasonables are only one of a growing number 
of peace vigils springing up across the Bay Area. In most cases, the vigilists 
are performing small gestures of public devotion to a cause they see as being 
overlooked.
<P>Whether it's Singing for Peace serenading BART riders or a man beaming a 
PowerPoint message on an Interstate 580 overpass, homegrown activists are 
taking their message to the streets. They are bypassing mainstream media 
outlets they say are ignoring their pleas for a peaceful resolution to the 
Iraqi crisis. They're tired of pundits accepting war as a foregone conclusion 
and giving little airtime to diplomatic solutions.
<P>Yet Sheehan said her group isn't full of activists, or "bored Marin 
housewives," as one naysayer referred to them. Their Jan. 4 protest -- in 
which they spelled "No War" on a Marin pasture -- in more waitresses (seven) 
than Ph.D.s (six), more social workers (four) than doctors (two) and only two 
self-described " '60s radicals." None was a nudist -- until recently.
<P>They are Sheehan's friends, and their friends, recruited through concentric 
e-mail list circles. The first participants were all from West Marin, but now 
they come from San Francisco, Berkeley and points beyond, all frustrated about 
not seeing their views represented.
<P>Making themselves so publicly vulnerable, Sheehan said, is a frantic 
semaphoric wave in the face of mainstream media indifference to the anti-war 
effort.
<P>She wasn't surprised that soon after she and her pals first began their 
protest, a CBS film crew came to visit. They were followed by calls from the 
BBC and radio stations from across the United States. Following their lead, 
copycat activists have stripped from Montana to Florida.

</table></font>Inspired by anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott and a group of <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0731-08.htm">Nigerian 
women -- who stared down Chevron officials there last summer</a> by threatening to 
disrobe unless village conditions improved -- Sheehan and the Unreasonables 
will be among the tens of thousands expected to attend a large anti-war march 
in San Francisco this Saturday.
<P>Vigilists like Singing for Peace and others have the same goal, just 
subtler tactics.
<P>They've joined longtime peace vigils like the Sunday walks around Oakland's 
Lake Merritt, which restarted a year ago after a 10-year hiatus, and groups of 
sign-wavers that convene in San Jose, Fremont and elsewhere.
<P>Some draw supportive honks and thumbs up. Other passers-by just shrug.
<P>On a recent Friday night outside the downtown Berkeley BART stop, 40 
smiling Singers for Peace members belted out "This Land Is Your Land."
<P>Not that a 25-year-old bookstore clerk, who asked to be identified only as 
Michael, heard them. He bolted past the ensemble, head down, the Grammy-
nominated "Nellyville" CD blasting through his headphones. Michael stiff-armed 
an offered flyer listing contact numbers for local members of Congress.
<P>"Do I support the war? No," Michael said a few steps away. "But this 
(vigil) isn't going to change my mind. Or anybody else's. It's Berkeley. 
There's always somebody opening their mouth and handing you something."
<P>Vigilists hear "What's the point?" questions a lot.
<P>Are the vigils going to change anybody's opinion in Washington? And, here 
in the left-leaning land that's re-elected congressional doves like Barbara 
Lee and Nancy Pelosi, aren't vigilists just singing to the regional choir?
<P>Vigil regulars respond that the civil rights movement was about hundreds of 
small gestures across the country. That public demonstrations, small and large,
<P>shaped public opinion and helped end the Vietnam War, apartheid and Soviet 
rule in Eastern Europe.
<P>Besides, they say, the Bay Area isn't a unified choir. Not only did Reps. 
Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, and Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, support a 
resolution authorizing President Bush to use force in Iraq, but vigil 
supporters regularly hear from hecklers.
<P>Almost as important, participants say displaying their opposition to war is 
an emotional outlet.
<P>"As for why people do it, I think it's 50 percent for themselves and 50 
percent for other people," said Betsy Rose, the Berkeley musician who 
organized Singing for Peace three months ago. She has taken it to weekly gigs 
at BART stops from Orinda to the Mission District.
<P>"But," she said, "I think we do need to get out to the suburbs more."
<P>Holding a vigil can be lonely outside the friendly confines of the San 
Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley axis of peace. Ask Ken Meyercord, a Pleasant Hill 
man who organized Sunday peace walks last year in Walnut Creek. They ended 
after three months and a peak turnout of 14 walkers.
<P>"But I'm not discouraged, because of all the support I heard from people 
out there," said Meyercord, a 58-year-old computer systems developer who lives 
"in a neighborhood where everybody's got a flag outside."
<P>He'll continue to seek ways to express his opposition to a war, like the 
time last year when he donned a Napoleonic outfit and flew an Earth flag over 
his boat -- right past Fleet Week spectators on San Francisco's Embarcadero.
<P>"I'm out there because a lot of other people are afraid to express their 
opinions publicly," Meyercord said. "A lot of Muslims have come up to us and 
thanked us, because we're saying what they'd like to, but are afraid."
<P>Bolstered by attendance from Green Party members, and students from South 
Bay Catholic schools, David Lowe has been joined by 40 folks at the weekly 
Friday evening vigils he's organized in San Jose for the past year. "When 
people just need some place to express themselves, we're here for them," Lowe 
said.
<P>While nearly all of the vigils are nonconfrontational, the California 
Highway Patrol has asked Webb Mealy to end his anti-war PowerPoint 
presentation on a pedestrian walkway over I-580 in Oakland, fearing that 
traffic would be impeded. He obliged.
<P>The 47-year-old, who took a sabbatical from his multimedia work nine months 
ago to devote time to the peace effort, was beaming to eastbound motorists a 
15-second message featuring the phrases "No Greed/No Hate/No War" and "Solar 
Power/Solar Peace."
<P>"I want to do my part," he said, "to persuade my fellow citizens that it's 
not ethically justifiable nor safe to go to war."
<P>It's a message that activists like Meany wish was easier to broadcast.</p>
