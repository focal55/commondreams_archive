<p>Much has been written about how Iraqis complicated the task of 
rebuilding their country by looting it after Saddam Hussein's regime 
fell. In the case of the international airport outside Baghdad, 
however, the theft and vandalism were conducted largely by victorious 
American troops, according to U.S. officials, Iraqi Airways staff 
members and other airport workers. The troops, they say, stole 
duty-free items, needlessly shot up the airport and trashed five 
serviceable Boeing airplanes. "I don't want to detract from all the 
great work that's going 
into getting the airport running again," says Lieut. John Welsh, the 
Army civil-affairs officer charged with bringing the airport back 
into operation. "But you've got to ask, If this could have been 
avoided, did we shoot ourselves in the foot here?"
<P>
What was then called Saddam International Airport fell to soldiers 
of the 3rd Infantry Division on April 3. For the next two weeks, 
airport workers say, soldiers sleeping in the airport's main terminal 
helped themselves to items in the duty-free shop, including alcohol, 
cassettes, perfume, cigarettes and expensive watches. Welsh, who 
arrived in Iraq in late April, was so alarmed by the thievery that he 
rounded up a group of Iraqi airport employees to help him clean out 
the shop and its storage area. He locked everything in two 
containers and turned them over to the shop's owner.
<P> "The man had 
tears in his eyes when I showed 
him what we had saved," says
Welsh. "He thought he'd lost everything."
<p>
Coalition soldiers also vandalized the airport, American sources say. 
A boardroom table that Welsh and Iraqi civil-aviation authority 
officials sat around in early May was, a week later, a pile of glass 
and splintered wood. Terminal windows were smashed, and almost every 
door in the building was broken, says Welsh. A TIME photographer who 
flew out of the airport on April 12 saw wrecked furniture and 
English-language graffiti throughout the airport office building as 
well as a sign warning that soldiers caught vandalizing or looting 
would be court-martialed. "There was no chance this was done by 
Iraqis" before the airport fell, says a senior Pentagon official. 
"The airport was 
secure when this was done." Iraqi airport staff concede that some of 
the damage was inflicted by Iraqi exiles attached to the Army, but 
these Iraqis too were under American control. 
<p>
The airplanes suffered the greatest damage. Of the 10 Iraqi Airways 
jets on the tarmac when the airport fell, a U.S. inspection in early 
May found that five were serviceable: three 727s, a 747 and a 737. 
Over the next few weeks, U.S. soldiers looking for comfortable seats 
and souvenirs ripped out many of the planes' fittings, slashed seats, 
damaged cockpit equipment and popped out every windshield. "It's 
unlikely any of the planes will fly again," says Welsh, a reservist 
who works for the aviation firm Pratt & Whitney as a quality-control 
liaison officer to Boeing. 
<p>
U.S. estimates of the cost of the damage and theft begin at a few 
million dollars and go as high as $100 million. Airport workers say 
even now air conditioners and other equipment are regularly stolen. 
"Soldiers do this stuff all the time, everywhere. It's warfare," says 
a U.S. military official. "But the conflict was over when this was 
done. These are just bored soldiers." Says Welsh: "If we're here to 
rebuild the country, then anything we break we have to fix. We need 
to train these guys to go from shoot-it-up to securing 
infrastructure. Otherwise we're just making more work for ourselves. 
And we have to pay for it."
