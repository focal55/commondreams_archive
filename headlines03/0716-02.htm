<p>ABU GHRAIB, Iraq   - A grenade attack killed a U.S.  soldier in Iraq Wednesday, bringing the total combat deaths to  147, equaling the total in the 1991 Gulf War.<P>
The latest death heaped pressure on U.S President Bush,  facing mounting criticism for the cost of the war and  accusations the United States exaggerated intelligence on  Iraq's weapons to justify the conflict.<P>

</table></font>Nearly four hours after the first attack, a U.S. military  Humvee car was hit by a blast in Baghdad which inflicted  casualties among U.S. soldiers, witnesses said.<P>
"We heard an explosion and we ducked down in our trucks.  The soldier who was killed was blown out of his truck. He is  laying out there on the highway," a soldier, who declined to be  identified, said of the first attack.<P>
He was in a military convoy driving along the highway near  Abu Ghraib, 16 miles west of Baghdad, when there was an  explosion. A U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad said the convoy  was ambushed with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms  fire.<P>
"As the convoy passed that truck over there blew up,"  Specialist Jose Colon told Reuters at the scene.<P>
One soldier put his arm around another and comforted him as  he cried while sitting on the barrier dividing the road. Two  other soldiers were wounded, U.S. soldiers said.<P>
Witnesses said the Baghdad explosion damaged the vehicle  and forced it off the road near a highway leading to the  airport, adding that three or four soldiers in the vehicle were  hurt.<P>
A U.S. soldier was also wounded in an attack overnight in  central Baghdad, the military said.<P>
HUMAN COST<P>
The Pentagon said military expenses for the war and its  aftermath have cost the United States $48 billion to date, with  a monthly price tag over the next couple of months estimated at  more than $3.9 billion.<P>
Senate Democrats blasted Bush for the rising cost of the  war and not seeking more international help in rebuilding Iraq  in the face of skyrocketing U.S. budget deficits.<P>
Senator Mark Dayton, a Minnesota Democrat, called for "a  clear, direct and reliable accounting" of the war's costs.<P>
But the human cost is becoming all too clear as U.S. forces  come under daily attack in Iraq. The attacks have continued  despite a crackdown by U.S. troops in areas north of the  capital, once a hotbed for Saddam Hussein loyalists.<P>
The body of the dead soldier lay on the highway covered  with a yellow sheet as the two wounded men received treatment.  Helicopters hovered above and U.S. soldiers stood guard,  pointing their machineguns toward the edge of the road and  peering through binoculars for other possible attackers.<P>
About 40 Iraqis walked from their neighborhood and watched.<P>
"We are happy because this is an occupation," said Mansour  Badri, a teen-ager who lives in a village nearby. "The  Americans lied to us when they said they would save us from  Saddam. They just want to occupy our country."<P>
Badri and his friends said Baath Party supporters had been  encouraging teenagers like them to fight against Americans and  had offered them money.<P>
The United States has about 146,000 of its troops in Iraq,  and U.S. commanders have said they expect to maintain that  troop level for the foreseeable future.<P>
U.S. administrator Paul Bremer said Washington and London  would pull out their forces from Iraq once the coalition's  mission was accomplished.<P>
"We have no desire to stay a day longer than necessary," he  told reporters in Baghdad Tuesday.<P>
To prepare the ground to punish members of Saddam's  government, Iraq's new U.S.-backed Governing Council agreed on  Tuesday to set up a war crimes tribunal.<P>
A delegation from the Governing Council will visit U.N.  headquarters in New York next week and hopes to address the  Security Council, U.N. officials said. The council will also  lobby for a seat in the U.N. General Assembly.
