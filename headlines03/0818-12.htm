<p>As the Bush administration dispatched crews to investigate the largest blackout in North American history, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham warned Sunday that consumers will eventually pay up to $50 billion in higher electric bills to modernize the nation's ailing power transmission system.

<p>"Rate-payers, obviously, will pay the bill because they're the ones who benefit," he said on Face the Nation. "And that's where most of the responsibility, ultimately, will be assigned."

 
 

  
 
 
  
 

 
<p>Abraham declined to speculate on what triggered last week's cascading outages that left 50 million people without power, but other energy analysts said it was increasingly apparent the failure began with power lines outside Cleveland.

<p>Less clear, said Michehl Gent, head of the North American Electric Reliability Council, is why the system's warning alarms did not catch and confine the problem to Northeastern Ohio.

<p>"There were fail-safe steps in place, and they didn't work," he said on CNN's Late Edition.

<p>In only three minutes Thursday afternoon, 21 power plants in six states stretching from New York to Michigan and into Canada crashed.

<p>With power fully restored, many residents and businesses continued the return to normalcy, albeit uncertainly.

<p>In New York, officials braced for the start of the workweek, warning that the power needed to keep office computers, air conditioners and elevators humming might trigger rolling blackouts.

<p>"We just don't have a lot of extra power," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. "So be careful."

<p>Residents in Detroit and Cleveland still needed to boil drinking water, but Gov. Jennifer Granola, D-Mitch., felt confident enough to attend the National Governors' Association meeting in Indianapolis. When General Motors reopens its Detroit plant today, the company will keep unnecessary lights off and, despite the August heat, reduce air conditioning use.

<p>Similar cutbacks were imposed in Canada. After a weekend without subway service, officials in Toronto told businesses to cut power usage by half, fearing increased energy demands today could force more blackouts.

<p>"So far the experience has been the general public has cooperated," Ontario Premier Ernie Eves said at a news conference. "We are imploring commercial, retail and industrial users to cooperate as well."

<p>With the immediate crisis quelled, political leaders ratcheted up the debate over that was to blame and what can be done to prevent similar outages.

<p>Gent, during several media interviews, suggested human error might have been responsible for the missed signals in Ohio. Energy executives there replied it was too early to tell.

<p>"There has to be much more going on in the system than four downed lines," said Ralph Din cola, spokesman for Akron's First Energy Corp., which owns the northeastern Ohio lines that have been blamed for starting the chain reaction that led to the blackout. "Our understanding from a preliminary analysis of data is that the Eastern Interconnection [power grid] was experiencing unusual electrical conditions as early as noon on Thursday. What happened in our system could not have triggered such a huge, multi-state outage, absent other events in the grid."

<p>The Midwest Independent System Transmission Operator, which monitors electrical reliability in the region, said in a statement that while it is clear that four power lines "tripped off" the day the blackout began, "what is unknown is the relationship among events in the Midwest and what was occurring elsewhere in the Eastern Interconnection at that time."

<p>"What we're trying to say is that focus solely on the events in Ohio may be misleading," said MISO spokeswoman Mary Lynn Webster.

<p>Alan Schreiber of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the distribution of energy in the state, said he is withholding judgment about "whether First Energy screwed up" until more information is available.

<p>He said investigators should not rule out the possibility that multiple events triggered the blackout, creating "a perfect storm of electricity."

<p>In Washington, several legislators renewed calls for the regional approach developed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

<p>But Abraham suggested the White House would rather wait three years before considering creation of regional energy organizations to oversee delivery of power.

<p>The FERC proposal "goes to the question of whether or not we would mandate and force down the throats of regional areas of the country a federal approach to deregulation of the marketplace," he said on Fox News Sunday.

<p>Instead, President Bush will press for enforceable reliability requirements and incentives to expand transmission capacity, Abraham said.

<p>"What we need to address the power outage problems are, first, mandatory reliability standards in other words, behavior standards that can be enforced -- and more transmission," he said.

<p>Appearing Sunday on four news programs, Abraham, the former Michigan governor lobbied for sweeping energy legislation that has been bottled up in Congress for two years. "We really need Congress to finish the job here," he said.

<p>But Democratic members urged Bush to set aside controversial aspects of the bill such as a proposal to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

<p>"We can address this problem if we're smart enough to know that what we have to do is to see to it that we solve the immediate problem, and then we move on to other questions, like drilling in Alaska," Rep. John Dingell, D-Mitch., said on Fox. "My old daddy used to say, kill the closest snake first, and that's what it is I think we have to do."
