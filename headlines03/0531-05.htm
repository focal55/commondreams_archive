<p>Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been put under temporary arrest in the country's north after a violent clash between her supporters and a pro-junta group which left four dead, the junta said.</p>
<p>"Aung San Suu Kyi has been temporarily placed under the protection of local authorities," military spokesman Brigadier General Than Tun told reporters, adding that her entourage was also taken to the safe house and put in "protective custody."</p>
<p>Than Tun said eight motor vehicles and nine motorcycles were destroyed in the melee, which broke out in the town of Ye U in Sagaing division on Friday night at 8:00 pm (1330 GMT) and continued for three hours.</p>
<p>"Four persons died during the scuffle and 50 were injured," Than Tun said. The four were killed in a car accident during the scuffle, he said, but did not specify which group they belonged to.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi was on a month-long political tour of Myanmar's north, which became increasingly tense as her supporters repeatedly clashed with members of the junta-sponsored Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA).</p>
<p>Than Tun accused NLD members of setting fire to at least one of the vehicles used by the USDA. Some 5,000 members of the pro-junta group had been waiting in Ye U for the NLD party to arrive Friday.</p>
<p>NLD party secretary Tin Oo and 17 NLD youth members had accompanied their leader on the trip, but their ranks grew as scores of supporters joined them along the way.</p>
<p>Than Tun said there were no immediate plans to bring Aung San Suu Kyi back to the capital. She was due to return June 4. The opposition leader was released from house arrest a year ago with a guarantee of free movement around the country.</p>
<p>The government spokesman expressed confidence that the dramatic events would not completely derail the political reconciliation process between the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi, which is widely viewed as having stalled in recent months.</p>
<p>"Although these incidents instigated by the NLD will adversely affect national reconciliation, we do not consider that this will stop the dialogue," he said.</p>
<p>"Investigations are still going on," he said, adding that it was too early to comment on what action would be taken against the NLD. </p>
<p>Labour Minister Tinn Win blamed the outbreak of violence on Aung San Suu Kyi. </p>
<p>"These incidents happened because Aung San Suu Kyi had taken advantage of her party organizational trip to campaign publicly, thereby making many people resent her actions," he told reporters.</p>
<p>"It is regrettable that these incidents happened, but this was brought upon them by their own actions, because they had been disturbing the peace at all of the townships that they have visited."</p>
<p>He complained that Aung San Suu Kyi had been giving anti-government public speeches.</p>
<p>The NLD's Yangon headquarters were sealed by the junta on Saturday prior to the announcement of her arrest.</p>
<p>Also Saturday, Myanmar's state-run press was openly critical of the Nobel peace laureate, the first time such criticism has appeared since UN-brokered talks began between the democracy leader and junta in October 2000.</p>
<p>UN special envoy Razali Ismail, who is credited with brokering the secret talks, is due to make his 10th visit to Myanmar from June 6 in a bid to revive the process.</p>
