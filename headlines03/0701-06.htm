<p>The last Israeli tanks moved out of Beit Hanoun
yesterday, exposing the worst destruction since the
military assaults on Jenin and other West Bank cities
more than a year ago. <P>Palestinians who returned to the small Gaza town
occupied by the Israeli army for six weeks found that
armored bulldozers had leveled dozens of homes and
factories, torn up roads and uprooted trees, up to the
edge of the only public border crossing from Israel into
the Gaza strip.
<P>"I don't know why they destroyed it," said Mohammed
Bishara who found his house flattened. "The Israelis
say they had to do this because Hamas was firing
rockets from here but they weren't. Everybody knows
they were using the fields. Anyway, they destroyed my
house and it didn't stop the rockets so I think it means
they wanted to punish me for what Hamas does."<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>The Israelis said they went into Beit Hanoun to stop
Hamas firing home-made rockets, known as Qassams,
into Israel. It suits both sides to portray the rockets as
fearsome but after more than 2,000 firings not one
person has been killed and most miss their target by a
long way.<P>The army said much of the town had been destroyed
for "security reasons".<P>Yesterday, the Israelis completed their pullout and
began lifting the checkpoints following the ceasefire
declaration by Hamas, Fatah and Islamic Jihad after
nearly three years of intifada.<P>But the killing continued on the West Bank as the
Al-Aqsa martyrs brigades faction, which has not
signed up to the ceasefire, shot a Romanian working
with an Israeli construction team. The shooting was not
seen as an immediate threat to the truce.<P>In Beit Hanoun, there was relief at the Israeli
withdrawal, although in Gaza the ceasefire is seen as
a lull in the conflict.<P>As well as destroying homes, the Israelis ripped up
1,000 acres of citrus trees that once made the town
one of the more prosperous in Gaza.<P>The farmers began replanting a few days ago as the
deal for the Israeli pullout was in the works, but it will
take 10 years before they bear fruit.<P>"It's nothing less than economic sabotage," said
Abdel-Rhanan al-Masri, Beit Hanoun's representative to
the Palestinian parliament. "We have lost
three-quarters of our trees to the bulldozers. Our
industry is destroyed. We have no doubt why. It was
collective punishment - and in clearing our trees, the
bulldozers cleared the path for the Israeli citrus
industry."<P>The destruction stops at the edge of a petrol station.
Khader Massoud worked as the attendant when the
tanks rolled in. He came back yesterday. "The tanks
destroyed the forecourt right up to the door and the
front two pumps are shot up," he said. "But the other
two pumps are fine and we still had petrol so I started
selling right away."<P>There is little sign that the fruit and vegetable
processing plant was next door ever existed. All that
remains is a jumble of earth and concrete.<P>Mr Massoud has no time for the Israelis but he is also
scornful of Hamas. "People are very angry about the
Qassam rockets because it brings destruction to us.
People want to live, to survive, to be able to work. We
don't want them to fire more rockets," he said.<P>Last month, a few dozen residents took to the streets
to protest against Hamas firing rockets. But there was
only one protest. Some Palestinians said people were
too frightened of Hamas to do it again.<P>Netzarim junction, to the south of Beit Hanoun,
became notorious early in the intifada as the place
where the Israeli army shot a terrified 12-year-old boy,
Muhammad Dura, as he clung to his father.<P>The road at Netzarim junction has been closed for 18
months, forcing tens of thousands of people to make a
45-minute detour through Gaza city for what should be
a five-minute drive. This was in order to "protect" 60
ideological fundamentalist Jewish families on a nearby
settlement.<P>Yesterday, the road was reopened, although the Israeli
army has only pulled back 100 meters to a large
concrete pillbox. Beside the road, the Palestinian
police erected a small green tent with a flag on a pole
and a portrait of Yasser Arafat at the entrance.
<P>The Jewish settlers were not happy, among them
Shlomit Ziv who moved to Netzarim 10 years ago.
"There have been numerous attacks on this road -
shootings, road bombs, bomb-laden carts and
donkeys. And after each attack the road is closed for a
few months, then reopened until the next attack," she
said.<P>The Palestinians are well used to clearing up after
Israeli destruction. A lorry from the Palestinian energy
authority drew up next to some of the downed power
lines. Mohammed Al Kafarna was driving a mechanical
shovel clearing the rubble. "It's the third time I've
cleared up Beit Hanoun. I don't think it's the last," he
said.<P><B>&#183;</B> Israel yesterday cut its contacts with the BBC over
what it termed coverage akin to the worst "Nazi
propaganda". Officials described as "the last straw" a
documentary on alleged nuclear and chemical arms
programs that was shown abroad at the weekend.
The BBC will no longer be granted interviews with
government officials but will be allowed to attend
government news conferences.</p>
