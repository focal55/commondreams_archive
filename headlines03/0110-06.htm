<p>BAGHDAD - Europe moved to stay America's hand  over Iraq on Friday, as top officials spoke out against a rush  to war on the basis of inconclusive weapons inspections.
<p>

"Without proof, it would be very difficult to start a war,"  the European Union's foreign policy coordinator Javier Solana  told French newspaper Le Monde.<p>

		One of President Saddam Hussein's main Iraqi enemies also  urged against an invasion and warned that the sort of occupying  force Washington envisages would face broad, armed resistance.<p>

		"We reject the idea of an invasion and occupation of Iraqi  territory," said Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, head of the  Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).<p>

		After U.N. inspectors told the Security Council on Thursday  they had found no "smoking gun" to challenge Iraq's insistence  it has no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, Washington  made clear it still felt Baghdad was defying the United  Nations.<p>

		With the world's eyes turning to North Korea, which has  admitted developing nuclear weapons and pulled out of the  Non-Proliferation Treaty on Friday, U.S. officials insisted  Iraq posed a major threat, however little the inspections  found.<p>

		"The problem with guns that are hidden is you can't see  their smoke," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on  Thursday. "We know for a fact that there are weapons there."<p>

		Chief inspector Hans Blix told the Security Council Iraq  had "failed to answer a great many questions."<p>

		U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte said Iraq was deceiving the  U.N. and if it continued it would again be in "material breach"  of the latest Council resolution, language that could mean war.<p>

		In Iraq, U.N. experts visited three sites on Friday,  including a rocket fuel plant that Britain has alleged may be  developing missiles to carry chemical or germ warheads.<p>

		EUROPE HESITANT<p>

		The United States is building a large military force of  more than 100,000 troops in the Gulf region.<p>

		But the European Union's executive head, European  Commission President Romano Prodi, called for renewed efforts  to avoid war.<p>

		"War is not and must not be inevitable. We all have to do  everything we can to find a peaceful solution to the crisis,"  he said in Greece, which holds the Union's rotating presidency  and has said it will lead an EU peace mission to Arab capitals  soon.<p>

		The 15 EU nations are sharply divided over Iraq. Britain is  mobilizing its forces alongside the Americans despite  widespread disquiet within Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour  party.<p>

		The bloc's other main military power, France, is cooler,  insisting on an international mandate for any war. Germany, the  biggest economy, is opposed outright the idea of attacking  Iraq.<p>

		"Inspections should continue and for that reason there are  no grounds for military action," Berlin's ambassador to the  United Nations, Gunter Pleuger, said in New York.<p>

		Britain's envoy, too, suggested there was no undue focus on  Blix's next report to the Council on January 27: "The 27th of  January won't necessarily produce anything new or dramatic,"  said Jeremy Greenstock. "So my advice is -- calm down."<p>

		Washington has little need of European military assistance  and has made clear it is willing to fight alone if need be.<p>

		SHI'ITE LEADER OPPOSED<p>

		In Iraq's neighbor Turkey, a key NATO ally which houses  U.S. bases,  Prime Minister Abdullah Gul wrote to Baghdad  urging Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions to avert a  conflict.<p>

		But further away, another close U.S. ally, Australia, said  it might send troops to the Middle East in the coming weeks.<p>

		Shi'ite leader Hakim, whose movement counts thousands of  fighters in the south, told al-Hayat newspaper an attack could  upset the entire region and urged the U.N. and Arab bodies to  concentrate instead on persuading Saddam to step aside.<p>

		Washington has sketched plans for a post-Saddam Iraq that  it says would be the most ambitious since the occupation of  Germany and Japan after World War II. Critics portray that as a  grab for Iraq's vast oil wealth and say it could get bogged  down in the ethnically and religiously divided nation of 23  million.<p>

		"We reject the appointment of a foreign military ruler in  Iraq and also reject a foreign power imposing any ruler," said  Hakim, whose group has held discussions with U.S. officials.  "Such an occupation would naturally face violent resistance."
