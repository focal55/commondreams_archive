<p>Anti-war protests erupted across the globe following the start of the US-led war against Iraq, with hundreds of thousands expected to march to demand a quick end to air strikes on Baghdad.</p>

An Australian uses his surfboard as a placard as thousands march towards the U.S. Consulate and the Prime Minister's office in Sydney, March 20, 2003. A wave of anti-war protests began to roll across Europe and the Middle East on Thursday after the opening salvos of the war against Iraq sparked angry demonstrations in Asia and Australia. Barely three hours after the first U.S. missiles struck Baghdad, a crowd that organizers put at 40,000 and which police said numbered 'tens of thousands' brought Australia's second largest city, Melbourne, to a standstill.

</table></font>Between 80,000 and 100,000 demonstrators thronged central Athens in response to the launch of targetted strikes against Iraqi targets, according to initial police estimates, but organizers put the figure at at least 200,000.</p>
<p>"It's unprecedented. People continue coming," said Vera Michailidou of the leftist anti-globalization group Action 2003, as protestors marched past the British embassy to the US mission, both heavily guarded by riot police.</p>
<p>Greek demonstrators, many of them high school students, adopted "Bush -- killer" as their slogan of choice, condemning US President George W. Bush for attempting to disarm Iraq and topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein by force.</p>
<p>Anti-war groups around the world have organized protests on Thursday to voice anger over the way in which Washington and London have defied popular opposition to launch a second Gulf war.</p>
<p>Millions have marched to oppose the war in past weekends, dogging world leaders that have backed Bush's campaign, like Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain, Jose Maria Aznar of Spain and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy.</p>
<p>The protest in Athens, the biggest so far for the day, followed angry anti-US demonstrations across Pakistan and spirited marches in Australia, which has contributed some 2,000 troops to the US-led coalition against Saddam.</p>
<p>"Saddam Hussein is a hero of Muslims," shouted one protestor in the Islamist-ruled city of Peshawar in northwest Pakistan, where hundreds of students, lawyers and journalists denounced US "aggression" in Iraq.</p>
<p>A coalition of secular anti-war groups launched a boycott of US fast food outlets like McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which are enormously popular with Pakistanis. More rallies were expected later Thursday.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-populated nation, about 1,000 protestors gathered outside the heavily guarded US embassy in Jakarta, carrying signs reading, "Bush, go to hell" and "Terrorism No, Justice Yes."</p>
<p>In Australia, thousands took to the streets just hours after the first air strikes against Iraqi targets, with more than 10,000 protesting in central Sydney and 20,000 in the country's second city Melbourne.</p>
<p>One woman was arrested at the US consulate in Melbourne for splashing red paint and scrawling "killing has started" on statues outside the building, police said.</p>
<p>"It's about sending the Americans a message, and this is their address," said one demonstrator outside the consulate, Catherine Robson.</p>
<p>Security has been stepped up at US embassies and consulates around the world as many anti-war groups have called for demonstrations outside the diplomatic missions to show contempt for the US insistence on ousting Saddam by force.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 students in Berlin peacefully marched toward the US embassy near the city's Brandenburg Gate, carrying placards reading "Give peace a chance" and "War is not the answer".</p>
<p>Another 5,000 students rallied outside the US consulate in the southern city of Munich, with 7,000 demonstrating in Saarbruecken in the west. Peace groups said some 250 protests would be staged in Germany -- where opposition to war in strong -- throughout the day.</p>
<p>Thousands of students streamed out of classrooms across Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and Italy, with Swiss schoolchildren carrying the rainbow-striped flags which have become a symbol for peace in Europe.</p>
<p>In Italy, the country's main unions called for a two-hour general strike due to begin at 3:00 pm (1400 GMT).</p>
<p>The US embassy in central Paris, where French police have set up a tight security cordon, was closed to the public on Thursday ahead of a demonstration planned for 1700 GMT.</p>
<p>In Russia, two hundred Communists and ultra-nationalists -- confronted by three times as many police -- decried what they called the "barbaric" US-led military campaign in Iraq, chanting "Yankee go home" and "No to war".</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&sub=31" target="_new">major protest</a> is planned for Saturday in New York City, following the success of a similar march one month ago that drew around 250,000 demonstrators.</p>
