<p>WASHINGTON - The number of Palestinians in poverty has tripled over the last two years due to closures imposed by Israel both across borders and in areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to a World Bank report released yesterday.
<P>

   The report found that 60 percent of Palestininans now live on less than $2 a day and that the Palestinian economy has averted complete collapse by increases in foreign aid and because the Palestinian Authority pays an estimated half of all wages  earned in the West Bank and Gaza.
<P>

   Israel has sharply limited movement of Palestinians in an effort to stop suicide attacks, such as one yesterday in Haifa that killed at least  15  people. The bus bombing, the first in two months, followed a spate of Israeli  military incursions in a hunt for terror suspects over the last five weeks that have killed 80 Palestinians, including gunmen and civilians.
<P>

   The policy of internal closures - preventing people from moving from village to village - has been the single greatest factor hurting the Palestinian economy, said the report. It examined the entire period of the second Palestinian intifadah, or uprising, which began in September 2000.
<P>

   Nigel Roberts, the World Bank director for West Bank and Gaza, said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem that the situation will not improve until some political progress is made to ease the crisis and allow Palestinians and goods to move freely in the region.
<P>

   Roberts said the hardest-hit areas are in the northern and southern parts of the West Bank as well as southern Gaza, populations that depend largely on wages earned in Israel. ''That's where poverty rates are the most highly concentrated,'' Roberts said. ''There are areas in southern Gaza where the levels of unemployment are as high as 80 percent.'' Overall, unemployment stands at 53 percent of the Palestinian work force, the World Bank estimated.
<P>

   In September 2000, prior to the outbreak of the intifadah, an estimated 128,000 Palestinians worked in Israel and on Israeli settlements. In recent months, 32,000 permits were issued, but thousands of them couldn't be used, especially from southern Gaza, because of internal closures.
<P>

   Setting a poverty line at $2 a day, the World Bank estimated that 637,000 Palestinians were poor on the eve of the intifadah. That number has ballooned to just under 2 million today, it  said.
<P>

   The increasingly dire conditions are reflected in the average daily food consumption of a poor person, now equivalent to $1.32 per day, compared to $1.47 in September 2000. A study funded by the US Agency for International Development  and CARE, released last September, estimated that 13.3 percent of the population in Gaza suffer from acute malnutrition, similiar to levels found in Zimbabwe (13 percent) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (13.9 percent).
<P>

   Over the last two years, foreign donors have doubled assistance from pre-intifadah years, to $1.05 billion in 2002. The Palestinian Authority employs one-third of an estimated 125,000 people receiving a monthly salary in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said.
<P>

   Even if political progress is made, rebuilding the Palestinian economy will not be simple, Roberts said.
<P>

   ''Everyone has to be concerned about a couple of factors,'' he said. ''First is the declining capital investment. The numbers show it has fallen 90 percent since 1999. It could be as low as $150 million in 2002. The other issue is the impact on human capital, the lack of continuity of education, and the psychological environment that people are growing up in.''
<P>

   Roberts said that when a region experiences such an economic shock, ''you are set back in terms of your competitiveness with the regional and global market. The rest of the world is not standing still while the Palestinians are in their prolonged recession.
<P>

   ''I'm not saying recovery is not possible,'' he said. ''If you had a political rapprochement that had a significant lifting of the closures, you could see a significant rebound. It still would require a lot of help from the outside.''
<P>

   An Israeli government spokesman said Palestinians were responsible for their misery. ''Palestinians know exactly what they have to do,'' Ra'anan Gissin   said. ''They have to stop terrorism.''
<P>

The intifadah also has caused major economic harm to Israeli tourism and economic interests. Earlier this year, the Israeli government asked the Bush administration for a supplement aid package  of $4 billion  in security assistance and $8 billion  in loan guarantees, aimed at helping the country recover from economic losses linked to the intifadah as well as pay for increased security related to a possible war with Iraq.
