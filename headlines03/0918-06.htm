<p>WASHINGTON - A band of former Clinton administration officials and environmental lobbyists is trying to exploit the Democrats' long-standing edge on environmental issues to help reclaim the White House in 2004.
<p> The group, called Environment2004, hopes to identify, target and mobilize a niche of environmental voters in a handful of key states to tip the electoral balance against President Bush in the 2004 election.</p>
 <p> Group leaders want to harness outrage about Bush's stances on issues such as logging, global warming and drilling in Alaska and the Rocky Mountains to give a crucial edge to the eventual Democratic nominee. The plan is to discredit what they call Bush's "greenwashing," his position that his pro-development policies are also nature-friendly.</p>
 <p> "The record of this administration is so outrageous, it energizes people who have not in the past been energized," said Frank Loy, a former Clinton administration State Department official who chairs Environment2004. "It's not an issue that will sway tens of millions. It will sway millions. In a few states, a swing of 50,000 is a big swing."</p>
 <p> Loy is joined on the board by former Clinton Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Clinton EPA Director Carol Browner and California Secretary for Resources Mary Nichols. The group is planning an official announcement on Oct. 15.</p>
 <p> Also on the 17-member board is Deana Perlmutter, a Denver lobbyist and senior vice president of the Dutko Group whose husband is former state Sen. Ed Perlmutter, D-Golden.</p>
 <p> The group's "boutique" strategy is to tip the balance in as few as five states, Loy said. They have yet to be determined, but the only Western state under consideration is New Mexico.</p>
 <p> Leaders of the group want to raise millions of dollars for the general election, using an exemption in federal law that allows them to accept contributions of any size. The group's short-term goal has been to raise $500,000 no later than mid-October in order to get an office opened in Washington.</p>
 <p> They plan to coordinate closely with whoever becomes the Democratic presidential nominee. That could mean helping the presumptive nominee between the primaries and the official nomination, when federal dollars become available.</p>
 <p> That's something that most environmental groups, which are legally nonpartisan, nonprofit organizations, can't do, even if Republicans view most of them as an arm of the Democratic Party.</p>
 <p> Democratic contenders said they were not familiar with the group but supported the effort.</p>
 <p> "It's a group that has an easy case to make," said Eric Schmeltzer, spokesman for the Howard Dean campaign. "Any group that can get out there and expose Republican environmental policy for what it is would be a positive thing."</p>
 <p> Bush aides say they don't see environmental issues as a vulnerability, saying attacks on the president's policies have come from "permanent partisans" who are more concerned about politics than nature.</p>
 <p> "The world needs another partisan special interest group distorting the president's accomplishment about as badly as network TV needs another reality show," said Mark Pfeifle, spokesman for the Bush administration's Interior Department.</p>
 <p> But Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said that using the environment as an issue can help win back voters who supported Green Party candidate Ralph Nader because they saw no difference between Democrats and Republicans. It can also appeal to independents who care about the environment, he said.</p>
 <p> Mellman said Bush's vulnerability on the environment can be seen in the president's decision to travel around the country in August to green up his image.</p>
 <p> Former Colorado Democratic Party chairman Tim Knaus questioned the wisdom of pushing the environment as an issue, saying, "It's a nice thought, but I'm not really sure it does move voters." But Mike Stratton, a Denver political consultant, said he sees real promise in luring back Nader voters.</p>
 <p> "People who voted with the environment as their primary issue in 2000 didn't necessarily vote for Gore," Stratton said. "But if they do vote with Democrats in the future, Democrats will win."</p>
