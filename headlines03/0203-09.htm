<p>WEEKI WACHEE -- They honked horns, yelled praise and profanities, and raised fingers -- sometimes two, in a peace sign; other times, just one.
<P>   Hundreds of drivers zipping past an antiwar protest Saturday afternoon at U.S. 19 and State Road 50 voiced or gestured in support or opposition, providing a glimpse of the divided sentiment splitting the county and the country over possible U.S. military action against Iraq.

</table></font>More than 25 people, including two war veterans, bundled up and joined former independent congressional candidate Brian Moore to protest war, waving signs that read: Why Rush to War? Let the Inspection Work! and Who Would Jesus Bomb?
<P>   It may have been one of the first antiwar protests in Hernando County. But it won't be the last, the protesters said. They plan to meet again next weekend, at the same time and place.
<P>   "I'm here because I just don't like war," said Nettie Lange, 62, of Spring Hill. Lange had never joined an antiwar protest and was excited to have her first opportunity in what has been her home county for the past 14 years. "I just can't see us going into this war when we don't have all the facts."
<P>   Some protesters were particularly angry at the country's leadership.
<P>   "The only person who would want to get into a war is some stupid, draft-dodging S.O.B. who's never been in one," yelled Charles Wingrove, 72, a veteran who fought in both Korea and Vietnam. Wingrove served in the Air Force and later the Army from 1948 through 1968.
<P>   Many drivers were supportive and cheered as they drove by. Some, including Mary Gabbard of Weeki Wachee, joined the group after driving by.
<P>   "I'm very much against this war. I don't believe in sending our boys there," said Gabbard, who was on her way home from a computer class.
<P>   Other drivers, however, were not so supportive. About a dozen motorists pulled cars slowly past the protesters to boo, to call them anti-American or to yell, "Go home, hippies."
<P>   Two people were so indignant at the protest that they decided to pull over and argue with the protesters. One of them was Joe Rabasca of Spring Hill, a veteran wearing a camouflage shirt with military and prisoner of war patches.
<P>   "This opposition is only hurting our troops," said Rabasca, 53, who served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. "This is just what happened in Vietnam, and I don't think this helps the country."
<P>   The only real incident occurred when an angry Eckerd manager threatened to have protesters' cars towed if they did not move them from the store's parking lot. She declined to talk further with a Times reporter.
<P>   At least three Hernando County sheriff's deputies sat nearby during the noon-to-2 p.m. protest to ensure the traffic moved smoothly. U.S. 19 at SR 50 is dangerous and accident-prone, even when drivers have nothing to distract them, Deputy William Boettger said.
<P>   Boettger also told the protesters that deputies had better things to do than "sit here and babysit" protesters.
<P>   "Obviously, we can't make you go home," Boettger told Moore, the organizer. "But if it's causing more of a problem than what it's worth, we will have to step in."
<P>   Several Eckerd customers paused in the parking lot to consider the protest, which took place along the public rights of way.
<P>   "I'm impressed," said Duane Woods of Spring Hill, who stopped at Eckerd to purchase some cough syrup. "I don't think we should be getting into any military action, because we have enough problems here at home."
