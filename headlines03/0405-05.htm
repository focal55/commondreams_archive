<p>COLLEGE PARK, Ga. -- A quip by Sen. John F. Kerry calling for "regime change" in Washington has sparked a rhetorical brawl in the race for president, as Republicans accuse the Democratic hopeful of dishonoring the war effort and breaking a promise to withhold criticism while U.S. troops are in danger.

<p>The Massachusetts lawmaker, in turn, accused GOP leaders Friday of purposely distorting a tongue-in-cheek remark and vowed "not to be silenced by their fake-patriotism argument."

<p>"Republicans are falsely and phonily trying to trump up an issue," Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, said in an interview. The remark "was a rhetorical twist, nothing serious" and "had nothing to do with the troops and nothing to do with over there," he added.

<p>The contretemps follows a speech Kerry gave Wednesday at the Peterborough Town Library in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first presidential primary. In the course of his remarks the senator restated his frequent criticism of President Bush's foreign policy and said the administration had so ruptured relations with U.S. allies that only a new president could mend the damage. "What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States," Kerry said.

<p>The line is one he has used before, including in a speech last month at the state Democratic Party convention in Sacramento. Still, an account in Thursday's Boston Globe prompted a storm of GOP criticism, including outrage from Republican National Committee Chairman Marc Racicot and the top party leaders in Congress.

<p>"Senator Kerry crossed a grave line when he dared to suggest the replacement of America's commander in chief at a time when America is at war," Racicot said. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee said the statement amounted to "petty, partisan insults launched solely for personal political gain."

<p>Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, accused Kerry of grasping for political advantage. "America before New Hampshire," DeLay said.

<p>Jim Dyke, a spokesman for the RNC, said Friday that the remark also constituted a violation of a pledge Kerry made last month to tone down his rhetoric as soon as U.S. troops were engaged in battle. "Once the shooting starts, nothing could be worse for our troops than hearing something that might upset them," Dyke said.

<p>Kerry responded briefly in a speech Thursday night at a Georgia Democratic Party fund-raiser outside Atlanta. He called it his "pleasure" to be attacked by Republicans "for speaking out regarding the direction of our country."

<p>"I don't need any lessons in patriotism or in caring about America from the likes of the right wing and Tom DeLay and others," said Kerry, who was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts during two combat tours in Vietnam. DeLay and Frist did not serve in the military. Racicot, an attorney, served in the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps from 1973 to 1976.

<p>Kerry expanded on his remarks Friday when the issue showed no sign of abating. Following a speech to schoolteachers in Washington, D.C., Kerry said, "I'm not going to let the likes of Tom DeLay question my patriotism, which I fought for and bled for in order to have the right to speak out."

<p>In a follow-up interview, Kerry also insisted that he has stayed true to his promise not to second-guess Bush's conduct of the war once it commenced. "I've defended the administration against the armchair quarterbacking, which I think is premature," Kerry said. "I think our troops are doing an extraordinary job. I have nothing but praise and admiration for them."

<p>A spokesman for DeLay, Jonathan Grella, responded Friday by saying, "There's a difference between loving your country and leading it. Demanding regime change in America isn't unpatriotic. It's vile."

<p>Strategists for Kerry were thrilled at the back-and-forth, which crowded out news of their candidate's second-place finish this week, behind North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, in the early campaign money chase.

<p>"Any day we're having a fight with Tom DeLay and Rush Limbaugh is a day we're having a fight with the right people," said the strategist, referring to the radio talk show host who helped fuel Republican rage over Kerry's comments. "It only serves to validate for Democratic voters what a good Democrat you are."
