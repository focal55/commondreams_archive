<p>The first thing Anne Roesler does every morning is check the 
Internet for news of the 82nd Airborne.
<P>It's the same anxious routine followed by thousands of American parents 
with children stationed in Iraq. But with Roesler there's one major difference:
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">
    <tr valign="top">
      <td width=350 height="255" align=right><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><img border="0" src="images/1024-01.jpg" width="350" height="241"><br>
      Anne Roesler holds a picture of her son while framed by a sign made for a San Francisco peace rally in February.<br>
    </font> </td>
    </tr>
  </table></font>She passionately opposes the war fought by her son, an Army staff sergeant 
with the 82nd Airborne Division. 
<P>If most military parents are consoled by "support our troops" patriotism, 
Roesler and others opposed to the U.S. occupation say theirs is a special 
isolation. Yes, they support the troops. But when they oppose the war, some 
people question not just their loyalty to their country, but also to their 
children.
<P>Roesler was communicating with other Bay Area military parents until the 
war started. "And then several of them felt that we had to close ranks (and 
support the Bush administration) because that was what patriotism was all 
about," Roesler said. "And I said, 'Absolutely not. That's not what patriotism 
means to me.' "
<P>On Saturday, Roesler will join a small contingent of military parents in 
an anti-war march in San Francisco. The event begins with a rally at 11 a.m. 
in Civic Center, followed by a march to Jefferson Square Park. Along with a 
demonstration Saturday in Washington, D.C., it figures to be one of the 
largest protests since the war began in March.
<P>Both demonstrations are drawing energy from parents and spouses who go to 
the mailbox each morning hoping to see a letter from Iraq, and go to bed each 
night dreading a knock at the door.
<P>In recent months, hundreds have joined organizations like <a href="http://www.mfso.org/" target="_new">Military 
Families Speak Out</a> and the newly formed <a href="http://www.bringthemhomenow.org/" target="_new">Bring Them Home Now</a>. Several parents 
have publicly shared the demoralization, fear and concern gleaned from letters 
and calls from their children in Iraq. A Pennsylvania mother made headlines in 
September by shopping for body armor for her son after hearing that the 
Pentagon wouldn't be able to supply every soldier with updated vests until 
December. 
<P>Yet the moral authority that the voice of the military parent lends to 
the peace movement comes with a price.
<P>"There is a social pressure not to speak out,'' said Judith Ross, a 57-
year-old San Franciscan with a son in the Marines. She is organizing a 
contingent of families for Saturday's demonstration, but like many military 
parents, she asked that her son's name not be used so backlash about her 
activism wouldn't touch him.
<P>At one Washington, D.C., demonstration earlier this year, a man 
approached Military Families Speak Out co-founder Charley Richardson and told 
him, "You're a disgrace to your son,'' Richardson said. He was carrying a sign 
reading, "Our son is a Marine. Don't send him to a war for oil."
<P>Asked how his son feels about his activism, Richardson said, "We don't 
speak for him, but he supports our right to speak out."
<P>In Saratoga, Roesler also asks that her son's name not be used. But 
otherwise, her heart races and mind wanders just like any other parent with a 
child in combat.
<P>Anxiety nearly paralyzed her from the moment her 25-year-old landed in 
the Middle East in February until the first time he called her in June. 
<P>Her son is not a letter-writer; the only note he has sent was scribbled 
on the back of an MRE box shortly before the U.S. invasion in March. Roesler 
began sobbing as she recalled the few lines on the back of the makeshift 
postcard.
<P>"He just said, 'I'm OK, I'm going to be OK, I'll be home soon,' " Roesler 
said. "But I live in fear of getting that knock on the door. I don't know what 
my life would be like without him, but I refuse to believe that anything bad 
is going to happen to him." 
<P>The 50-year-old Roesler grew up in a military family. Her father was 
wounded in World War II, and her grandfather fought in World War I. Now, 
however, her home office is covered with peace banners, bumper stickers and a 
photo of her son in uniform.
<P>When her son said he wanted to join the military, she wasn't happy and 
she told him so. He didn't need money for college, but felt he needed to have 
more structure and discipline in his life. 
<P>Eventually, Roesler understood that and respected his reasons for 
enlisting. Likewise, she said, her son respects her activism; he has since he 
was in the fifth grade. That's when somebody asked him what his mother did for 
a living. He responded, "She wants to save the world."
<P>"And it's become a family joke since then,'' Roesler said. "Everybody 
says I want to save the world."
<P>Lately, she says, she's noticed a change in her son in the phone calls 
she gets from him every five weeks or so. He's been having tea with Iraqi 
families, trying to understand their culture and the source of the differences 
between the United States and Iraq. 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="425">

  </table></font>He's told his mother that after his hitch is over in 2007, he wants to 
return to the Middle East as a civilian to help the two cultures understand 
each other better and "prevent all this miscommunication that leads to war," 
Roesler said.
<P>Jane Bright's son joined the military three years ago for many of the 
same reasons as Roesler's son. The discipline. The structure. A natural leader,
<P>Evan Ashcraft was promoted quickly, rising to the rank of sergeant in the 
101st Airborne Division.
<P>A year ago, his mother began attending anti-war demonstrations in Los 
Angeles, where she lives, hoping to keep the war from starting and stop her 
son from being sent to fight it.
<P>When she failed and Ashcraft was sent overseas, she continued to lobby to 
bring American soldiers home. Mother and son never discussed her protests; she 
didn't want her son to feel that she disagreed with what he was doing.
<P>On July 24, the Jeep in which Ashcraft was riding was ambushed by a 
grenade attack. Ashcraft died instantly, leaving behind his wife of three 
years. He was supposed to come home this month.
<P>A few weeks after Ashcraft's death, the military sent home the contents 
of his pockets to his wife. "I don't want to know what was in there,'' Bright 
said. "I can't. It's too poignant."
<P>Instead, she will honor his memory by continuing to speak out against the 
war that killed her son. No matter what other people say to her.
<P>"To me," Bright said, "supporting the troops means bringing them home now.
