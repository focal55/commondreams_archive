<p>NEW ORLEANS -- A Marine reservist from Seattle who faces a court-martial here says he's being prosecuted for criticizing the military at anti-war rallies and for publicizing his application for conscientious objector status at a news conference. <P>
The Marines argue they pursued charges against Lance Cpl. Stephen Funk because he skipped out on 47 days of training in defiance of orders by his commander. <P>

</table></font>A pretrial hearing is scheduled Monday, when Funk's attorney, Stephen Collier, intends to ask a military judge to dismiss the charge of &quot;shirking important duty&quot; on the basis that Funk has been selectively targeted. <P>
&quot;People go AWOL (absent without leave) all the time and they don't get court-martialed,&quot; says Collier, who has handled military clients off and on since the first Gulf War. &quot;He's a conscientious objector who went public with his beliefs, and that's something that should be respected, not retaliated against.&quot; <P>
There are 23 Marine reservists currently seeking conscientious objector status, which soldiers may do if they can prove that during their service they developed deep opposition to all wars. All of them have been transferred to New Orleans, home of the Marine Reserve headquarters, for processing. <P>
&quot;Funk was the only one who didn't show up when his unit was being mobilized for the war, and he's the only one being prosecuted,&quot; Marine spokesman Capt. Jeff Poole says. &quot;They told him, 'You'll be in trouble if you don't show up.' &quot; <P>
Funk, 21, who says he joined the Marines because he wanted the discipline but believes now that it was a mistake, also recently revealed that he is gay. He thinks he has been treated unfairly because of his sexual orientation, but says that was not an issue in his application for conscientious objector status. <P>
&quot;I could have just said that I was gay and I would have been gone in three weeks, but it wouldn't have been honest. It's not why I'm opposed to being in the military,&quot; Funk said. <P>
&quot;Certainly, I'm oppressed in the military, but I can deal with that. That's a personal problem. But if I was forced to go to war ... than I would be perpetuating oppression and violence against others,&quot; Funk said. &quot;I can deal with people not liking me for who I am, but when I'm forced to do that toward others, I refuse.&quot;  <P>
Originally from the Seattle area, where he excelled in a small alternative high school called Nova Project, Funk briefly attended the University of Southern California before dropping out and moving to San Francisco. Then 19, he felt he was foundering. A Marine recruiter gave him the impression that joining the service would help him develop discipline and leadership skills. <P>
A self-described liberal who had never shot a gun and voted for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the last presidential election, Funk was intrigued by the challenge of being a Marine. <P>
But around February, with war in Iraq imminent, Funk told his commander he would be consulting a lawyer about his options for leaving the service. He then missed the trip when his support battalion was sent to Camp Pendleton near San Diego.  <P>
