<p>The Democrats are ramping up efforts to 
                          launch a liberal think tank in September that they say 
                          will give their party the unified message it lacked 
                          in 2002 and counter the well-funded network of conservative 
policy shops.</p>
                        <p>John Podesta, who served as White House 
                          chief of staff during the Clinton administration, is 
                          spearheading the project and consulting with Democratic 
                          leaders on Capitol Hill.</p>
                        <p>The think tank, known for now as the American 
                          Majority Institute, will have an annual operating budget 
                          of at least $10 million, a sum that would immediately 
                          make it the largest Democratic think tank in town. </p>
                        <p>By comparison, the Progressive Policy 
                          Institute, the think tank affiliated with the centrist 
                          Democratic Leadership Council, has an annual operating 
                          budget of around $3 million. </p>
                        <p>Key Democrats attribute Republican control 
                          of the White House and both branches of Congress in 
                          part to their party&#8217;s lack of an effective mechanism 
                          for disseminating liberal ideas to the public and the 
                          media. They say such wealthy conservative groups as 
                          the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise 
                          Institute (AEI) have helped Republicans gain the upper 
                          hand in the battle over ideas.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;Certainly right now the conservative 
                          right does a much better job of feeding the media beast 
                          facts and arguments that make their case,&#8221; said 
                          Joe Lockhart, a Democratic consultant who served as 
                          White House spokesman in the Clinton administration. 
                          &#8220;On the progressive side of the aisle, we&#8217;ve 
                          been asleep at the wheel.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>&#8220;This will be part of the push-back 
                          effort,&#8221; he added, referring to the American Majority 
                          Institute. </p>
                        <p>Indicating the importance of the project, 
                          Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) convened 
                          a meeting of leading Senate Democrats to review and 
                          discuss it shortly before the Memorial Day recess.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;We have to begin building a structure 
                          similar to that which the Republicans have funded for 
                          many years,&#8221; said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), 
                          chairman of the Democratic Policy Conference. &#8220;We&#8217;re 
                          trying to begin that process, but it&#8217;s slow. We 
                          don&#8217;t have the same easy funding sources that 
                          the Republicans have had.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>The American Majority Institute moved 
                          into new offices at 15th and H Streets N.W. this week 
                          and has already filled some key slots. Podesta will 
                          serve as president; Laura Nichols, who worked as communications 
                          director for former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt 
                          (D-Mo.), will be senior vice president; Sarah Wartell, 
                          who served as chief of staff for the National Economic 
                          Council in the Clinton administration, will be the chief 
                          operating officer; and Neera Tanden, former policy director 
                          and deputy campaign manager for Sen. Hillary Clinton 
                          (D-N.Y.), will oversee domestic policy. <br>
                          Organizers will spend the summer raising money and hiring 
                          more staff before the formal launch in September. </p>
                        <p>Nichols said the institute will be a think 
                          tank &#8220;with a muscular communications component 
                          to it.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>&#8220;There are a number of excellent 
                          policy think tanks on the progressive side, but what 
                          they&#8217;re lacking is a serious marketing and communications 
                          component,&#8221; she said.</p>
                        <p>Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), chairman of 
                          the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said many 
                          in his party think liberal think tanks devoted to narrow 
                          topics need to be better organized.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a holistic view,&#8221; 
                          he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a belief that you need 
                          something central, you need to be able to partner with 
                          other [groups] that might do specific work and pull 
                          those things together.&#8221; </p>
                        <p>Some Democratic strategists view the new 
                          think tank as a vehicle for crafting a unified message, 
                          something the party struggled to find before last year&#8217;s 
                          election, when it lost control of the Senate and six 
                          seats in the House.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;It would serve as a communications 
                          hub for a lot of the policy ideas people have,&#8221; 
                          said a strategist familiar with the American Majority 
                          Institute. &#8220;It would be a place where people are 
                          brought together to hash out policy in a lot of different 
                          areas.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>Although some conservatives view the Brookings 
                          Institution &#8212; one of the largest policy think 
                          tanks in Washington, with an annual operating budget 
                          of around $36 billion &#8212; as left-leaning, many 
                          Democrats complain that it is too independent, academic 
                          and aloof to give their party much of a boost. </p>
<p>Indeed, Brookings describes itself as 
                          a &#8220;nonpartisan organization devoted to research, 
                          analysis, education and publication focused on public 
policy issues.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>By contrast, the Heritage Foundation, 
                          which has an annual operating budget of around $30 million, 
                          states its mission unambiguously: &#8220;To formulate 
                          and promote conservative public policies based on the 
                          principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual 
                          freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national 
defense.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>Republicans can rely on a slew of other 
                          well-funded conservative think tanks, such as the AEI 
                          (annual expenses: about $16 million), the Hudson Institute 
                          (annual budget: about $7 million), and the Cato Institute 
(annual budget: about $15 million).</p>
                        <p>Democrats have fewer allies, with less 
                          money. The Center on Budget &amp; Policy Priorities 
                          has an annual budget of around $8 million; the Economic 
Policy Institute has a budget close to $5 million. </p>
                        <p>The idea of creating a new Democratic 
                          think tank gained momentum when Steve Kirsch, the billionaire 
                          founder of the Internet search engine Infoseek, began 
pushing it. </p>
                        <p>&#8220;What happened is I started talking 
                          to various people in Washington saying, &#8216;We need 
                          a Heritage Foundation for the left.&#8217;&#8221; said 
Kirsch. </p>
                        <p>Soon after, a committee was set up to 
                          find someone to put the think tank together.&#8220;John Podesta was on virtually everybody&#8217;s 
                          shortlist,&#8221; Kirsch said.</p>
<p>However, Democrats say they realize it 
                          will take some time to build a policy network that can 
match conservative groups. </p>
                        <p>&#8220;The Heritage Foundation, the Cato 
                          Institute and other conservative think tanks have been 
                          at this for 40 years since [former Senator Barry] Goldwater 
                          [R-Ariz.] lost in 1964,&#8221; said Steve Grossman, 
a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
                        <p>Grossman said conservatives have achieved 
                          &#8220;a gradual dominance of think tanks, magazines, 
talk radio, and TV.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>&#8220;The intellectual capital for that 
                          [dominance has been fueled by] &#8230; what think tanks 
                          have been pouring out in thoughtful pieces that have 
been gradually accepted by other people,&#8221; he said.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;I think this is part of the push-back.&#8221;</p>
