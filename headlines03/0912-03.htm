<p>FALLUJA, Iraq - U.S. troops killed eight members  of an allied Iraqi security force on Friday in an apparent  "friendly fire" incident sure to inflame anti-American  sentiment already fueling a deadly guerrilla campaign.
<P>
In a separate incident in Ramadi in the heartland of  resistance to the occupation of Iraq, two U.S. soldiers were  killed and another seven wounded in a pre-dawn raid.  Police officer Assem Mohammed told Reuters a joint force of the  Iraqi police and the U.S.-backed security force of Falluja,  about 30 miles west of Baghdad, were chasing thieves in a car  shortly after midnight when U.S. soldiers opened fire,  mistaking them for guerrillas.<P>

  </table></font>There was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.<P>
"We were chasing a car when the Americans fired at us,"  Mohammed, who was wounded in the incident, said from his  hospital bed.<P>
"They continued firing for about an hour despite our pleas  for them to stop and to tell them we are police and security."<P>
A wounded comrade lay on another bed in the room, his white  shirt drenched in blood.<P>
Other police officers confirmed Mohammed's report and put  the toll at eight dead guards and three thieves. At least six  police and guards were also wounded.<P>
The Jordanian military hospital in the area was badly  damaged by crossfire, with the side of the one-story building  peppered by bullets and shells. Spent bullet casings littered  the road nearby, next to dried pools of blood.<P>
The Falluja Protection Force was set up by the U.S.  military with volunteers to help Iraqi police control the  unruly town.<P>
The latest U.S. casualties came during an exchange of  gunfire in Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad in the so- called  "Sunni Triangle" where support for deposed dictator Saddam  Hussein is strongest.<P>
Guerrillas have killed 71 U.S. soldiers since Washington  declared an end to major combat in Iraq on May 1. U.S.  officials blame the attacks on loyalists of ousted dictator  Saddam Hussein and foreign Islamist fighters.<P>
BURNING HUMVEE<P>
Hours after the incident in Falluja a roadside bomb in the  area destroyed a U.S. military Humvee driving in a convoy,  wounding at least three American soldiers, witnesses said.<P>
A Reuters photographer who arrived after the incident saw  bloodstains near the burning military vehicle.<P>
On Thursday, hooded guerrillas attacked U.S. soldiers  repairing a broken-down truck on the same road, prompting a  firefight that left one soldier wounded, two U.S. vehicles  destroyed and buildings aflame.<P>
President Bush will travel to the U.S. state of Georgia  later on Friday to welcome home U.S. troops as he works to  rally support for a postwar effort in Iraq that has grown  costly and dangerous.<P>
"The focus of his remarks will be on the progress we are  making in the war on terrorism, and the progress we are making  in Iraq, which is the central front in the war on terrorism," A  White House spokesman said on Thursday.<P>
Key U.N. Security Council foreign ministers are due to meet  in Geneva on Saturday to discuss a U.S.-drafted resolution to  pull more international troops and money to Iraq.<P>
Secretary of State Colin Powell said he did not expect  Germany, which staunchly opposed the war on Iraq, to send  troops but said it was playing its part in Afghanistan.<P>
"I'm not expecting any German troops," he said in an  interview with German television broadcast on Friday. "Germany  is playing its role." German soldiers make up the bulk of an  international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan.<P>
France and Germany want to downgrade the U.S. political  role in the occupied state and earlier this week jointly  submitted amendments to the resolution in which they called for  a stronger U.N. role in organizing elections and restoring  Iraqi sovereignty. Russia presented similar proposals  separately.<P>
In an editorial in the French daily Le Monde published on  Friday, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin  reiterated France's priority was restoring Iraqi sovereignty  and he set out a timetable, with elections envisaged by spring  2004.<P>
"Within a very short timeframe, for example one month, a  transitional Iraqi government could be put together from (the  Iraqi Governing Council) and would gradually be granted  executive power, including over economic and budgetary  activity," Villepin said.<P>
This would open the way for an international conference to  discuss Iraqi reconstruction, including individual  contributions to a future U.N. peacekeeping force, he said.
<P>
"General elections could be envisaged as soon as possible,  between now and spring 2004," he added.
