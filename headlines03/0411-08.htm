<p>GENEVA - At least 1,526 people were executed  worldwide last year, with 80 percent of all known executions  carried out in China, Iran and the United States, Amnesty  International said on Friday.<P>
The London-based human rights group also expressed concern  that U.S. military tribunals which will prosecute "terrorist"  suspects will have the power to impose death sentences which  cannot be appealed.<P>
In a report issued in Geneva, where the United Nations  Commission on Human Rights is holding its annual six-week  session, Amnesty urged the 53-member body to speak out against  the supreme punishment and build pressure for a global  moratorium on executions.<P>
Some 111 countries have abolished the death penalty in law  or in practice but it is still imposed in 83 countries, it  said.<P>
"The death penalty is the most absolute form of a human  rights violation," Amnesty's Andrea Huber told a news briefing.<P>
"The top three executioner states were China -- with 1,060  executions in only one year -- Iran with 113 executions and the  United States with 71 executions," she added.<P>
While the number of executions worldwide appeared to have  halved in 2002 from 3,048 executions in 2001, it was difficult  to compare as the true number of people executed in China was  believed to be much higher, according to Amnesty.<P>
In addition, at least 3,248 people were sentenced to death  in 67 countries in 2002, it said.<P>
"For many, Amina Lawal became a symbol of the horrifying  truth of the death penalty. She was sentenced to death by  stoning in Nigeria for having a baby out of wedlock," Huber  said. "Her appeal is still pending."<P>
U.S. DENOUNCED<P>
Amnesty denounced the United States for executing three  death row prisoners last year who were convicted for crimes  committed when they were under age 18.<P>
"It is a practice that violates international law...There  are many, many juvenile offenders on death row," Huber said.<P>
In total, 3,700 prisoners were under sentence of death in  the United States as of January 2003, according to the report.<P>
Huber added: "We know that there are many innocent people  who are sentenced to death."<P>
More than 100 death row inmates who proved their innocence  have been released in the 30 years since U.S. Supreme Court  rulings led to resumption of executions, according to Amnesty.<P>
Number 100 was Ray Krone, a former death row prisoner in  Arizona, released almost exactly a year ago after DNA testing  proved his innocence. He had been convicted by two juries for  the murder of a barmaid at a bar where he played darts.<P>
"I am one of the few fortunate ones who had a chance to  prove their innocence. It took a lot of work, perseverance and  money," he told reporters.<P>
Krone, who spent more than 10 years in prison, including 32  months on death row, had previously served in the U.S. air  force.<P>
"I am not proud of our justice system. Nobody who has seen  what I have seen or experienced what I have could ever support  the death penalty," he said.<P>
"I was naive, ignorant of how the system really worked. I  believed that innocence was protection, that truth meant  justice would be forthcoming," Krone said. "I am going to do  everything that I can to expose the death penalty for what it  really is -- a tool used by prosecutors and police to gain  career advancement and to put politicians in office."
