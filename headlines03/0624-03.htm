<p>HOPKINTON -- While an elegantly dressed, conservative crowd gathered yesterday at Richard Egan's home to listen in rapt attention to Vice President Dick Cheney, a different crowd stood at the busy corner of West Main and West Elm streets to send him a message.<!ENDSUMM!><P>
About 50 protesters, who called their gathering the &quot;We the People's reception for Dick Cheney,&quot; stood in front of the Community Covenant Church and held signs and banners decrying President George W. Bush's foreign and domestic policies.<P>
Members of peace groups from around Greater Boston and as far west as Worcester, they held signs that read, &quot;The world is not for profit, Dick.&quot; &quot;George Bush's policies leave 12 million children behind,&quot; and other sentiments.<P>

</table></font>Holocaust survivor Stella Penzer, wearing a red sequined beret decorated with anti-war buttons, cradled a sign that read, &quot;U.S. -- addicted to violence and war.&quot;<P>
&quot;My whole family was wiped out in the Holocaust, and I am a passionate believer in peace,&quot; said Penzer, who came to the protest from Newton Center. &quot;There is no good war, and no bad peace.&quot;<P>
The Cheney motorcade passed the protesters twice, at around 5:45 p.m. and about an hour later, after the vice president's stop at the Egan residence, where he spoke to about 600 supporters.<P>
&quot;I am sure that he saw us,&quot; said organizer Louise Coleman. &quot;It was chilling to see so many motorcycles and state police cars with him, and I'm amazed at how little time he spent here.&quot;<P>
Coleman sent e-mails to peace group members last week and asked them to join yesterday's protest.<P>
A statement sent by Coleman to the media said, &quot;The truth is that Americans are suffering because of this administration's policies...none more so than our fellow Americans, our soldiers, being killed in Iraq in a war that is a dishonest travesty....Also of particular concern is Dick Cheney's role in covering up the administration's machinations before and after the tragedy of September 11.&quot;<P>
Plenty of motorists slowed down to read the signs yesterday, and Hopkinton Police Chief Tom Irvin said the late afternoon traffic near that busy intersection was more brutal than usual.<P>
Hopkinton Police contacted Community Covenant Church to arrange a place for the protesters and provided extra personnel to keep traffic moving.<P>
Protester Alice Copeland Brown of Canton, dressed as a pilgrim woman in homage to her ancestor Joan Tilley, who Brown said came over on the Mayflower. Brown claimed that Bush was a distant cousin.<P>
When asked what brought her out that afternoon to protest against a relative, Brown answered, &quot;How do I count the ways? When they stole the election? If they steal one more election, I will follow Joan's example and emigrate to Canada.&quot;<P>
Brown said that an uninformed electorate is responsible for Bush being in office.<P>
&quot;We're savages, we're undereducated and we're easily brainwashed,&quot; she said.<P>
A few feet away, Isabel Jancowitz of Weston was continuing a 40-year commitment to the peace movement.<P>
&quot;This war is a slaughter,&quot; she said. &quot;Some vets are calling it a turkey shoot....It's immoral.&quot;<P>
Hopkinton veterinarian Margo Roman was among the protesters, along with a group of Teamsters who arrived in a bus decorated with their logo.<P>
As the Egan guests began heading west towards Gassett Road, where signs directed them to the party site, some protesters began calling out to them.<P>
&quot;Cheney is a war criminal,&quot; shouted one woman as a sleek black car passed. And a man called out, &quot;All millionaires, turn right!&quot;<P>
But most of the crowd held their signs quietly, unwavering in their commitment to the cause of peace. Hopkinton resident W. Al Brown said, &quot;I wouldn't be anywhere else right now.&quot;
