<p>TONY Blair suffered the biggest rebellion of his premiership last night, when 121 Labour MPs - almost half of the party’s back-benchers - voted against the government’s policy on Iraq. <p>
In a damaging split in the Labour ranks, a string of former cabinet ministers led scores of back-bench rebels to defy a three-line whip by supporting a motion stating the case for war remained unproven, despite a personal appeal by Mr Blair. <p>
The amendment was defeated by 393 to 199 votes, with 52 Liberal Democrats, ten nationalists and independents and 13 Conservatives joining the Labour rebels. <p>
A second vote on the government motion expressing support for the United Nations’ route was won by 434 votes to 124. <p>
The size of the Labour revolt was much higher than the 100 originally predicted and will raise questions about Mr Blair’s ability to persuade the country and his party that Britain and the United States should proceed with military action. <p>
The rebellion came as Hans Blix, the chief UN weapons inspector, said Iraq still had not made a "fundamental decision" to comply with resolution 1441 by disarming its weapons of mass destruction. <p>
Speaking before his report to the UN Security Council tomorrow, Mr Blix acknowledged Iraq had stepped up its efforts to release documents required by the inspectors. But he said there was no evidence of "full co-operation or a breakthrough" by Iraq. <p>
He said: "We have a very long list of disarmament issues and it will require a big effort in order to clarify all of those. I do not think I can say there is evidence of a fundamental decision [to disarm] but there is some evidence of some increased activity." <p>
Graham Allen MP, one of the rebellion’s leaders, said: "More than 200 parliamentarians are asking the Prime Minister to get off the escalator to war. I hope he will listen to parliament, which has spoken very carefully against war and against the George Bush timetable for war." <p>
John Reid, the party chairman, tried to put a brave face on a rebellion which dwarfed Labour’s previous biggest defeat in 1999, when 67 back-benchers voted against cuts to incapacity benefits. <p>
"It is roughly what I would have expected from meeting people throughout the country and also meeting people inside the Labour Party," he told Channel 4 News. "It is about a quarter of people who say the case has not been proven, and about three-quarters who are prepared to countenance military action if it becomes essential." <p>
Earlier, the Prime Minister and Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, had tried to allay back-bench concerns by promising to work "flat out" to resolve the crisis through the UN. Mr Straw even offered the olive branch of promising a vote on a substantive motion should military action become necessary. <p>
Confronting Labour critics, Mr Straw opened the Commons debate with a warning that containment had failed to work. "We are close now to the crunch point for Saddam Hussein," he said. <p>
Labour whips had hoped the concessions, combined with a relatively neutral motion calling on MPs to back the UN position, would be sufficient to head off a mass revolt. But many Labour MPs were furious that the government appeared determined to press ahead with a US-led timetable for war when the inspection process had not been fully exhausted. <p>
Although there was some support from the Labour benches, a string of prominent former ministers, led by Chris Smith, the former culture secretary, and Frank Dobson, the former health secretary, lined up to attack. Other rebels included Gavin Strang, George Galloway and Tam Dalyell. <p>
The revolt was reported to be the biggest ever inflicted on a government party. <p>
There was also dissent in the Conservative ranks, with Kenneth Clarke, another former health secretary, and John Gummer, the former environment secretary, speaking out against the rush to conflict. <p>
In an early indication of the troubles ahead for Downing Street, a devastating intervention during a Commons debate by Mr Smith was met with cheers from the Labour benches. <p>
"Strength does not lie simply in military might. Strength lies in simply having an unanswerable case. It lies in making the right moral choices, it lies in maintaining the pressure and it lies in securing the fullest possible international agreement," he said. <p>
The defeat might have been worse if some of the Labour rebels had not swung behind the government after a passionate intervention from their colleague, Ann Clwyd, who told of the horrific sights she had witnessed on a recent trip to Iraq. Ms Clwyd, previously opposed to military action, declared she was now in favor of regime change. 
<p>
Charles Kennedy, the leader of the Lib Dems, suggested this was a personal blow to Mr Blair. He said: "This is a very significant occasion. Despite investing masses of political and parliamentary capital, the government has still failed to persuade almost a third of the House of Commons at this crucial stage." <p>
Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, said the result "had been a breathtaking shot across the government’s bow".</p>
