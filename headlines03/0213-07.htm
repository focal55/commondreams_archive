<p>BAGHDAD, Feb 13  - A group of Western peace
activists said on Thursday they had written to former South
African President Nelson Mandela asking him to come to Iraq to
help them prevent war, but he said he needed a U.N. mandate.
<P> Mandela, a Nobel Peace Laureate, has accused U.S. President
George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair of running
roughshod over the United Nations in their bid to oust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>&quot;He has not responded yet, but we believe that Mr Mandela
would come,&quot; said Roberta Taman, spokeswomen for 15 activists
from Canada, Italy and other European countries who recently
arrived in Iraq.<P> Mandela's spokeswoman Zelda LaGrange said Mandela would need
a clear mandate from United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
before embarking on any trip to Baghdad.<P> &quot;He has received a number of requests to go to Iraq, but he
is adamant that he will not go unless he is requested by the
United Nations,&quot; LaGrange told Reuters in Johannesburg.<P> Mandela, a recipient of Bush's Presidential Medal of Freedom
last year, launched a blistering personal attack against the
U.S. president last month, questioning whether he would treat
the United Nations the same way if it wasn't headed by a black
man.<P> &quot;If the U.N. kindly requests him to go, then he will go,&quot;
LaGrange said.<P> In Baghdad, members of the group of activists -- one of
several around the world involved in a variety of solidarity
visits to Iraq -- said they would sit outside Iraqi power plants
and hospitals. It was unclear if they would remain there under
bombing.<P> &quot;We have a responsibility to say no to this war. There is no
justification,&quot; Taman told a news conference.<P> Millions of people in cities across the globe are expected
to demonstrate on Saturday against any U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
and organisers say it could be the world's biggest anti-war
protest.<P> Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected in London
and Rome, with smaller events planned from Antarctica to
Reykjavik. In South Africa, where President Thabo Mbeki shares
Mandela's anti-war position, demonstrations are planned in
Johannesburg, Cape Town and other major cities.<P> A group of about 50 peace activists said in Turkey this week
they had got visas to enter Iraq where they plan to disperse to
populated areas of Baghdad and other parts of the country,
acting as &quot;human shields&quot;.<P> They hope their presence and the possibility of Western
casualties will encourage U.S. political leaders and military
planners to rethink any plans to bomb Iraq over its alleged
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.<P> The Iraq Peace Team, another Western group, has been in the
country since September 2002 and pledges to stay with Iraqi
families if war erupts.<P> Neither Washington nor London, preparing for a possible war
over Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction, have said if
the presence of Western human shields would affect their plans.<P> In the Muslim world, the main rallying point for would-be
human shields is in Jordan. There, a campaign led by leftist
parties and civic bodies is seeking 100,000 volunteers.
