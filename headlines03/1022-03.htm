<p> WASHINGTON -- Invoking the spirit of the anti-war movement of the Vietnam era, an array of activists announced plans to march in the nation's capital on Saturday to demand that American troops be immediately withdrawn from Iraq.</P>

<P>    "The shout 'Bring the troops home now' will echo throughout Washington," said Brian Becker, an organizer of the demonstration. "No politician or the mass media will be able to deny that the anti-war sentiment in the country is not only 'not dead' but is instead growing with each passing day."</P>

</table>The organizers ranged from veteran leftist activists like Becker, a leader of Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER) to Stephen Cleghorn, the father of a U.S. soldier serving in Iraq and leader of Military Families Speak Out. At a press conference on Tuesday, they said tens of thousands of protesters from scores of organizations will take to the streets in Washington and other cities around the world.</P>

<P>    Their movement has reached the mainstream, they said.</P>

<P>    "I don't think we're fringe at all," said Imam Mahdi Bray of the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation. </P>

<P>    "Iraq may not yet be 'Vietnam' but it is quickly moving in that direction," said Becker. "And as during Vietnam, the anti-war movement can be the decisive political factor in forcing a U.S. withdrawal."</P>

<P>    The marchers will begin at the Ellipse, an oval park behind the White House, then go around the White House and Lafayette Park and up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Justice Department, and then back on Constitution Avenue to a stage on the grounds of the Washington Monument. The organizers said dozens of buses will bring in demonstrators from other cities.</P>

<P>    This will be the first major anti-war rally in Washington since April 12, when a crowd estimated by organizers at 30,000 strong gathered here. The demonstration will bring many more protesters, the organizers predicted.</P>

<P>    Increasingly, they contend, the sentiment on Main Street is turning against the occupation.</P>

<P>    "Why is Congress warming up to this issue? Largely, it's because reservists are being asked to perform a mission that they never signed up for," said Cleghorn. The reservists have been pulled away from the communities to occupy a foreign country and that doesn't sit well with their families and employers, who are voters, he said.</P>

<P>    At a Pentagon briefing Tuesday, officials said more National Guard and Reserve troops will be activated and notified within weeks that they are being deployed Iraq. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Marine Corps Gen. Peter Pace said no final decision has been made on how many will be called to active duty.</P>

<P>    They would not say whether the force of 133,000 U.S. troops now in Iraq might be cut next year. Troops are being rotated so that the standard tour is a year, just as it was in Vietnam. </P>

<P>    The anti-war movement has economic roots, too, said Leslie Cagan, national coordinator of United for Peace and Justice.</P>

<P>    "Here at home, we too pay a cost for this war," she said. President Bush's requested $87 billion on top of the previously authorized $79 billion for the war "means less money for our schools and health care and public transportation and housing and other social programs."</P>

<P>    The organizers pooh-poohed fears that pulling out U.S. troops would only increase Iraq's problems.</P>

<P>    "People say if we withdraw the troops now, there will be chaos. There already is chaos," said Cagan.</P>

<P>    "The occupation is not liberation," said Becker. "The Iraqi people want the U.S. troops to leave and the soldiers want to go home."</P>

<P>    Indeed, a poll by the military newspaper Stars and Stripes indicated that the spirits of U.S. soldiers are sagging. The paper's unscientific survey of 1,935 soldiers found a third describing their personal morale as low and half saying they do not plan to reenlist after their required service.</P>

<P>    About half of the respondents said their unit's morale is low and nearly a third said the war had little or no value.</P>

<P>    More than a dozen American troops haven't returned to duty after getting a vacation from Iraq, Pentagon spokesmen told the Associated Press on Tuesday. However, they denied that there is any significant AWOL problem.</P>

<P>    Sixteen of some 3,000 troops failed to show up at airports in Baltimore and Germany for return flights to the Persian Gulf region, Army spokesman Joe Burlas told the AP. None has been declared "absent without leave" as officials try to sort out the cases.</P>
