<p>As South Africa defended its policy of denying AIDS drugs to its population at a conference on the disease in Durban, the head of the UN's World Health Organization said the government's strategy was wrong.</p>
<p>In an interview with AFP on Tuesday, Lee Jong-wook also compared the worldwide AIDS crisis to "Armageddon", and said a massive increase in efforts to combat it was required, especially for Africa.</p>
<p>"In the African continent it would be wrong to talk about prevention, voluntarily counseling and testing, when people are actually dying. You have to provide treatment as well as prevention," said Lee, who took over as head of the Geneva-based agency last month.</p>

</table></font>South Africa has one of the highest AIDS rates in the world, with the UNAIDS agency estimating 360,000 deaths in 2001 -- an average of nearly 1,000 per day.</p>
<p>The government has come under heavy criticism for failing to adopt a national treatment plan for HIV/AIDS sufferers, choosing instead to focus on "nutritious diets" as a way to fight the disease for those infected.</p>
<p>But Lee said this was inadequate to deal with an epidemic he described as "a global security issue."</p>
<p>"It's almost like Armageddon, equivalent to something really big hitting the planet," Lee told AFP on the sidelines of an international anti-tobacco conference in Helsinki. </p>
<p>He pledged that the WHO would step up its battle against HIV and AIDS, mobilizing all available resources.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 million people are infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, with 27 million carriers of the virus on the African continent alone, he said.</p>
<p>"They are staggering numbers. We have to scale up the disease control in a major, major way," he said.</p>
<p>The average life expectancy in many African countries has declined to 45 or 46 years, and for the first time global population growth has been stopped because of the epidemic, he said.</p>
<p>"Losing this battle is not an option," Lee said.</p>
<p>Yet he said HIV/AIDS was, wrongly, no longer treated a major international issue, despite the death toll in the developing world still being in the millions.</p>
<p>"It's difficult because nowadays, we don't talk about AIDS in Europe and North America, because as long as you take medicine you can stay alive and lead almost a normal life," he noted.</p>
<p>But the availability of drugs was a huge problem in poorer countries.</p>
<p>"We have to make drugs, real drugs, available to people in the needy countries," he said.</p>
<p>In this, it was necessary to cooperate with the big pharmaceutical companies, and avoid hurting their interests because any reluctance to develop new drugs would damage the fight in the long-term, he said. </p>
<p>"We have to count on the research-based pharmaceutical industry to develop new anti-retroviral drugs. So we have to really encourage them to continuously develop new medicines, and at the same time vaccines."</p>
<p>"In Europe you really have to emphasize on prevention, because those who need treatment are getting their medicines. So here you really have to talk about prevention to the young population."</p>
<p>While the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was now under control, Lee cautioned any premature conclusion that the fight against the virus had been won.</p>
<p>We "have to be prepared if it comes back", he said.</p>
