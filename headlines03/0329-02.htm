<p>LONDON, Mar 29  - Labour Party MP Tam Dalyell, revered as the 'father'
of the British Parliament, sees catastrophic times ahead if the war on Iraq
continues.
</b>
						<p>
   ”God only knows how this will end,” Dalyell told IPS in an interview
Saturday. ”But if it must be ended sensibly, ”I can only say that there
should be a ceasefire forthwith that is mandated and administered by the UN.
It is clear already that this talk of achieving a regime change is
fanciful.”
<p>
   Dalyell said: ”They have not just miscalculated, they have completely
misunderstood the nature of Iraqi society and its institutions.”
<p>
   Tam Dalyell, who is known as the Father of the House because he is the
longest serving MP (he was elected first in 1962), carries considerable
weight in Parliament and in the public. He has led a loud campaign since the
build-up to the war that the government is deceiving the people.
<p>
   Dalyell, who has been closely monitoring the situation in Iraq, said most
people could see what the U.S. and British governments could not.
<p>
   ”When I was in Baghdad in 1994, a lot of people were very critical of
Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath party,” he said. ”When I went back in 1998,
there was far less criticism of Saddam Hussein. The effect of the bombing
and the sanctions had begun to tell. I must add that I went on my own
expense, and I was not beholden to anyone.”
<p>
   The U.S.-British alliance lost their cause when the war began, he said.
”Within the first night, the bombing blitz on Baghdad would have united most
Iraqis against the U.S. and Britain,” he said. ”So there is first a
misunderstanding about the nature of Iraqi society, and then a total
miscalculation about fighting the Iraqi people - and they are now fighting
the Iraqis, not Saddam Hussein.”
<p>
   The blunder has happened because ”people like U.S. Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, Vice-President Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld's deputy Paul
Wolfowitz have hijacked the U.S. government.”
<p>
   They have been backed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair because ”he is
a great believer in bombing,” Dalyell said. ”He likes the idea of being a
great war leader.”
<p>
   Among other consequences, ”British relations with France and Germany are
at present sub-zero, and I do not know how they can be put right without at
least a change of Prime Minister.” A demand for that change is beginning to
grow within Labour, he said.
<p>
   ”There is also great consternation within the Labour Party,” Dalyell
said. Of the 410 Labour MPs, 140 voted against the government move to back
the war. At the same time, Labour MPs also feel the need to back British
troops, he said.
<p>
   Dalyell, who served in a tank regiment himself for two years, says ”my
heart goes out to the soldiers.” He said leaders have no idea what it is
like to wear a tank suit, no idea how hot Iraq can be even in the early
summer. ”It was 80 degrees when I used to wear tank suits in the Rhine
Valley in Germany,” he said. ”And that is nothing like Basra.”
<p>
   Just the heat in Iraq can become a major problem, he said. ”Napoleon and
Hitler perished in the snow before Moscow,” he said. ”I think the allied
armies will be frizzled by the sun on the gates of Baghdad.”
<p>
   The blunders have been covered by a litany of lies in the build-up to the
war, Dalyell said. There is little that the British government is saying
that can be believed, he said.
<p>
   ”In the dossier on Iraq released by the British government late last
year, there is a long passage about the Iraqi football team having the soles
of their feet beaten for losing a qualifying match in 1997 for the world cup
football,” he said.
<p>
   ”I had checked with FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football
Association) at that time. They had said they sent the chairmen of the
football associations of Malaysia and Qatar to Iraq for an inquiry, along
with an experienced doctor. The members of the team showed no scars and
dismissed the allegations. The football officials said there was no truth in
those allegations. But why has the British government brought those
allegations into a dossier in late 2002?”
<p>
   The blunder over the passages plagiarized from a Californian research
student that found their way into the British dossier are well known, he
said. Apart from the nature of the source, ”if someone in a university had
done that, they would have been dismissed.”
<p>
   The dossier had spoken of uranium transactions between Iraq and Niger,
Dalyell said. But International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Mohammed
ElBaradei had established that those allegations were nonsense, he said.
<p>
   He quoted ElBaradei as saying: ”Based on thorough analysis, the IAEA has
concluded, with the concurrence of outside experts, that these documents -
which formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transactions
between Iraq and Niger - are in fact not authentic.”
<p>
   Dalyell said in Parliament: ”This is a matter of trust and deceit -
Parliament has been deceived. The British people have been deceived ... on a
matter which is the basis of peace and war.” Britain, he warned earlier, is
on ”a motorway without exit to war”. He was ordered out of the chamber when
he refused to sit down and give up.
<p>
   This is not the first time Dalyell has challenged a British government
over warlike moves. Twenty years ago he accused Margaret Thatcher of ”lying”
to the Commons during the Falklands War over the sinking of the Argentinean
ship, the General Belgrano. He maintained that the act of sinking the ship
was illegal. He relentlessly opposed the Falklands war.
