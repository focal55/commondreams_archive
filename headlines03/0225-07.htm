<p> PARIS/BAGHDAD  - The United States fired a warning  shot Tuesday across the bows of France, the leading critic of  its Iraq policy, saying it would view any French veto of a new  U.N. resolution authorizing force as "very unfriendly."
<p>

The U.S. ambassador in Paris issued the warning after  France said it and Germany opposed what it called a shift  toward "a logic of war" and circulated a rival proposal that  would give U.N. weapons inspectors at least four months to  scour Iraq.<p>

		Even as he spoke, other members of the decision-making U.N.  Security Council added their voices to the chorus of skepticism  over the resolution, clouding Washington's hopes of winning the  nine votes needed to pass it by mid-March.<p>

		Russia has backed the French proposal as has fellow  veto-wielding China, with some reservations. Beijing said it  saw no need for a new resolution and believed diplomatic  energies should focus on forcing Baghdad to disarm without war.<p>

		"Obviously, all delegations said they will study the draft,  which also has a rather rambling preamble," Russia's U.N. envoy  Sergei Lavrov told Russian television.<p>

		"But few share the conclusion contained in this resolution  -- that Iraq has wasted its chance. Most importantly, that  conclusion does not stem from the assessments repeatedly  presented to the Security Council by the inspectors  themselves."<p>

		Syria, the only Arab country on the 15-member council, said  it would vote against while Angola, Cameroon and Pakistan said  they had yet to decide what to do.<p>

		Pakistan, which faces unrest from Islamic militants if it  votes for war against Iraq, may abstain, diplomats said.<p>

		Washington, London and Madrid submitted the draft  resolution to the polarized council Monday. It declared that  Iraq had squandered its "final opportunity" to disarm.<p>

		TWO WEEKS TO CONCENTRATE MINDS<p>

		British Foreign Minister Jack Straw said the resolution  would not be put up for a vote for around two weeks, to allow  time to "concentrate the minds" of Security Council members and  offer Iraq a last chance to comply.<p>

		The U.S. ambassador in Paris, Howard Leach, said he hoped  France would agree the United Nations had to take action.<p>

		"I hope there won't be a veto because a veto would be very  unfriendly and we would not look favorably on that," he told  LCI television, according to a French translation of his  remarks in English.<p>

		No vote is expected until after chief weapons inspector  Hans Blix reports to the council again, probably on March 7, at  a meeting expected to be attended by foreign ministers.<p>

		A spokeswoman for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the  International Atomic Energy Agency, said a planned report by  its head had been advanced a month to coincide with Blix's  report.<p>

		In a boost for Washington, Ankara, which has dragged its  feet for weeks on an urgent U.S. request to set up a "northern  front" from Turkey against Iraq, said a motion on allowing U.S.  troops to deploy could be presented to parliament within hours.<p>

		But Turkey's deputy prime minister said it was unlikely  parliament would discuss the motion before Wednesday.<p>

		Saddam's top scientific adviser said Iraq was still  considering a U.N. order to destroy its al-Samoud missiles by  March 1, despite a U.S. television report the Iraqi leader had  indicated he would keep the weapons.<p>

		"It is still under consideration," General Amer al-Saadi  told reporters when asked about the U.N. demand to destroy the  missiles which the U.N. says have a longer than permitted  range.<p>

		The White House had said the case for war had been  strengthened by the comments which CBS television said had been  made in a rare interview it had with Saddam.<p>

		"Iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles and we are  committed to that," Saddam was quoted as saying. "We do not  have missiles that go beyond the proscribed range."<p>

		CONCESSIONS "DRIBBLE" FROM IRAQ -- BRITAIN<p>

		Straw said Saddam appeared to be behaving true to form.  "This is absolutely typical of the way Saddam behaves," he  said. "What he does is dribble out concessions, first of all  refusing inspections and then in the light of pressure  accepting them."<p>

		President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza  Rice, pledged Monday that the United States would try to turn  around war opponents France, Russia and China.<p>

		"We and the British and the Spanish and the others will  have an all-out diplomatic effort to talk to various parties  about the logic of this resolution and hopefully to bring  people around to vote for it," she told reporters in  Washington.<p>

		She said the United States wanted a decision from the  Security Council one way or the other in the days immediately  after Blix's March 7 report.<p>

		The crucial votes now belong to Angola, Cameroon, Guinea,  Pakistan, Mexico and Chile. All had favored the French position  of more inspections but now are studiously neutral as U.S. and  other officials approach their leaders.<p>

		To the frustration of U.S. officials, neighbor Mexico is  proving the most difficult to persuade, with a visit by Spanish  Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar last week yielding no results.<p>

		Tuesday, Blix completes two days of talks with his  16-member advisory board, called a College of Commissioners.<p>

		He has given them 30 to 40 "clusters" of "unresolved  disarmament questions" and asked the commissioners to place  them in order of priority.<p>

		Canada would like the council to turn those into  "benchmarks" Iraq should complete by mid-March or April.
