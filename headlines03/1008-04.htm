<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp; - Facing growing doubts at home about  the wisdom of attacking Iraq, President Bush on Wednesday will  launch a campaign to defend the U.S. invasion and cite progress  being made even as U.S. troops face almost daily attacks.
<P>
The attempt to gain control of the Iraq debate comes as  Bush's job approval ratings have been falling and the White  House has been on the defensive over a leak investigation and  failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.<P>
Two senior administration officials said on Tuesday the  campaign will begin with a Chicago speech by national security  adviser Condoleezza Rice. It was to continue on Thursday in  speeches by Bush in New Hampshire and Kentucky. And on Friday  Vice President Dick Cheney will deliver a speech in Washington.<P>
The campaign coincides with the six-month anniversary of  the fall of Saddam Hussein, a period marked by daily guerrilla  attacks on U.S. forces and complaints from Iraqis about the  slow transition to Iraqi self-rule from U.S. control.<P>
Washington in the next six weeks will send several Cabinet  secretaries on high-profile visits to Iraq to highlight various  progress being made, such as the new Iraqi currency coming on  line in coming days.<P>
In addition, Bush will give interviews to regional news  outlets next Monday and will devote his radio address to the  subject every Saturday this month.<P>
"What this will be is a sustained effort to show the  American people firsthand the benefits of our commitment as a  country, our commitment as a coalition, and our dedication as a  people who appreciate liberty and appreciate the work of our  soldiers," said White House communications director Dan  Bartlett.<P>
Rice's speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in  Chicago will be a key to the campaign. She will seek to combat  the impression that CIA weapons hunter David Kay came up empty  in his search for Iraqi weapons.<P>
Kay's team found no actual weapons but determined that  Iraq's weapons programs spanned more than two decades, involved  thousands of people and billions of dollars and were shielded  by security and deception.<P>
A senior official said Rice will go into detail about what  Kay found and "she will pointedly confront those who question  the wisdom of removing Saddam Hussein based upon the findings  of this report."<P>
She will remind Americans about how Saddam refused to  comply with U.N. Security Council resolution 1441 declaring  that he give up all weapons programs.<P>
In New Hampshire and Kentucky, Bush will focus his speeches  on how he sees his economic policies having helped people in  those states and how U.S. military personnel from those areas  have contributed to the Iraq war and war on terrorism.<P>
The Iraq war aftermath, with almost daily deaths of U.S.  forces, poses a political threat to the president 13 months  before Election Day.<P>
A CBS-New York Times last week found growing doubts about  whether the Iraq war was worth the costs. Only 41 percent said  it was, while 53 percent said it was not, although about half  said it was worth removing Saddam from power.<P>
Bush's campaign comes as he works to bolster support in the  U.S. Congress for an $87 billion spending request that includes  $20 billion for reconstruction that some members of Congress  would like to reduce or have in the form of loan guarantees.  Administration officials said they are confident they will get  an adequate funding level.
<P>
In addition, he is attempting to gain U.N. backing for a  new resolution creating a multinational force for Iraq to take  some of the strain off U.S. forces but the resolution is bogged  down in diplomatic negotiations.
