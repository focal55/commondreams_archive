<p>Tony Blair's government was last night shaken to its foundations by the apparent suicide of Dr David Kelly, the backroom Whitehall scientist caught in the lethal crossfire over weapons of mass destruction between Downing Street and the BBC. 

<p>Though No 10 moved quickly to concede a judicial inquiry, chaired by Lord Hutton, into the official handling of Dr Kelly during the last week of his life, the latest tragedy arising from the Iraq war looked set to cast an ever-longer shadow over Mr Blair's already troubled second administration. 

<p>The prime minister's Boeing 777 was high over the Pacific en route to Tokyo from his triumphant address to a joint session of Congress in Washington when news emerged at breakfast time of Dr Kelly's disappearance from his Oxfordshire home. The timing evoked Greek tragedy: triumph followed by disaster. 

<p>Within hours a body, still officially unidentified, was found shortly before Mr Blair's flight landed in the Japanese capital on what was meant to be routine trade and political business. 

<p>Alastair Campbell, the No 10 communications director, who is the main target of opposition and media attacks, had earlier flown home from the US and was busy last night organising the government's defence. 

<p>Mr Campbell has no intention of resigning over the tragedy. And some senior and well-informed backbench MPs believe that the report of the intelligence and security committee (ISC), expected in September around the same time as Lord Hutton's narrower investigation is published, will exonerate him from the BBC-promulgated charge of "sexing up" the key Iraq intelligence dossier. 

<p>Far from home, on the kind of week-long foreign trip which many voters mistrust, Mr Blair was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, his "history will forgive us" claim for the invasion of Iraq instantly overshadowed by the body discovered on Harrowdown Hill, near Abingdon. 

<p>The muted reaction to the tragedy of politicians on all sides is unlikely to last and there was immediate criticism of the way No 10 and the Ministry of Defence had, in the view of some MPs, allowed Dr Kelly to become the "fall guy" in the affair. 

<p>A Labour MP, Donald Anderson, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee (FAC), was also forced to defend his panel's conduct, despite concluding that Dr Kelly was "most unlikely" to be the BBC's mole and complaining in writing to Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, that the contract scientist had been "poorly treated by the government" since voluntarily admitting an "unauthorised" media contact. 

<p>The FAC interrogated the soft-spoken Dr Kelly on Tuesday, six days after he was outed as Whitehall's most likely source for the BBC reporter Andrew Gilligan. It was a rough session. Next day he endured a gentler grilling by the more senior intelligence and security committee of MPs and peers, who extracted "nothing new" from him. 

<p>Amid genuine distress expressed by Mr Blair and echoed by Iain Duncan Smith and Charles Kennedy, some MPs backed complaints that Dr Kelly was unfairly roughed up - a complaint Gilligan also made on his own behalf after a second FAC grilling on Thursday. 

<p>The FAC has already reported, though it has belatedly concluded Mr Gilligan is an "unsatisfactory witness". The reporter is unlikely to face ISC interrogation, though the committee will see transcripts of his and Dr Kelly's private testimony. So will Lord Hutton if he so wishes. 

<p>A key question facing the judicial inquiry is the pressure put on Dr Kelly by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, in the attempt to flush out the BBC's source. Mr Hoon is potentially as much in the frame as Mr Campbell. He and his senior officials will be crucial witnesses at the inquiry. 

<p>Crucial to the inquiry will be the circumstances surrounding Dr Kelly's admission to senior MoD officials that he might have been a source for Gilligan's claim that No 10 had inserted, against intelligence advice, the claim that Iraq could ready its banned weapons in 45 minutes. 

<p>The MoD says Dr Kelly volunteered that he had met Gilligan after reading the reporter's evidence to the FAC, as he later told MPs himself. Five days later, the MoD issued a carefully worded statement, agreed with Dr Kelly but drafted in a way that made it relatively easy for him to be identified. 

<p>Mr Hoon, like Mr Campbell, was convinced Dr Kelly was the BBC's source and relentlessly pursued the corporation in an effort to expose him. The corporation defied calls to confirm or deny that claim, insisting on protecting its source. 

<p>Both sides dug in, leaving Dr Kelly in no-man's-land. No 10 is adamant that it played no part in the process, but confirms he was warned that his agreed anonymity might not last. He was even offered secure accommodation and faced no disciplinary action other than a mild reprimand, officials said last night. 

<p>Dr Kelly left home, a three-storey 18th-century farmhouse in the south Oxfordshire village of Southmoor, at around 3pm on Thursday. When he failed to return after a few hours, friends and neighbours began to hunt for him. They called the police at 11.45pm. The force helicopter was scrambled and sniffer dogs were brought in. By morning more than 70 officers were involved and a body was found at about 9.30am in a wood on Harrowdown Hill, about two miles from Dr Kelly's home. 

<p>Though the body will not be formally identified until today, police are certain it is that of Dr Kelly. Clothes on the body matched those the scientist had been wearing. 

<p>The manner of his death remained unknown last night but it is understood investigators quickly ruled out natural causes. 

<p>Suggestions that Dr Kelly, a father of three daughters, suffered shotgun injuries or that a rope was found at the scene were discounted by police sources. No suicide note has been found at the scene or at Dr Kelly's home. 

<p>Police sources said the family did not report the disappearance more quickly because they were so sure that, despite the pressure he was under, he would not be driven to take his own life. 

<p>However, when Dr Kelly's wife, Janice, spoke to a close friend of her husband's, the television journalist and author Tom Mangold, before the body was found she conceded that her husband had been furious at how he had been treated over the last two weeks. Mangold said: "She said he was very stressed and unhappy about what had happened. This was really not the kind of world he wanted to live in." 

<p>She told Mangold her husband had felt physically sick after he left the foreign affairs committee. 

<p>The BBC was reeling from the news, appearing unsure how to react. It put out a short statement, which said: "We are shocked and saddened to hear what has happened and we extend our deepest sympathies to Dr Kelly's family and friends."
