<p>OMAHA, Sept. 14 — Becky Bunting, a 45-year-old job recruiter, was a big supporter of the invasion of Iraq and applauded the fall of Baghdad and President Bush's execution of the war. But these days, Mrs. Bunting is growing concerned about what is taking place there, unhappy with the mounting costs, disturbed by the casualties and, most of all, wondering how it is all going to end.</p>

</table>"I am very worried about it," Mrs. Bunting, a Republican, said today as she lounged in the crisp September sun in the Old Market district here.  "I have two brothers in the Navy. I think there are going to be a lot more  casualties. I think we are in there for the long haul.</p>
<P>
"I believe we did the right thing," she said. "But I don't see a winning situation here for anybody."</p>
<P>
The sentiments expressed by Mrs. Bunting today were hardly unusual.</p>
<P>
A week after President Bush's speech seeking to rally support for  the campaign in Iraq, the nation appears increasingly anxious about the war effort and worried that the United States may be trapped in an adventure from which there is no evident exit, according to interviews  during the last five days with Americans across the nation, historians, social scientists and pollsters.</p>
<P>
Some people went so far as to suggest a comparison with an earlier military action that had an unhappy history: the war in Vietnam.</p>
<P>
There is no sign that Americans have turned from their original support of what many describe as the object of the invasion: removing Saddam Hussein from power and lessening the threat of terrorist attacks at home. And support for Mr. Bush remains relatively strong, if not as strong as it was even a month ago, according to pollsters.</p>
<P>
But there is, by many measures, a gnawing unease about the course of this mission and a realization that the conflict will be deadlier, more expensive and longer-lasting than Mr. Bush signaled when he landed on an aircraft carrier off San Diego on May 1 to celebrate the fall of Saddam Hussein. In the most recent evidence of that, a Washington Post/ABC News poll published today found a nine-point jump in the last three weeks, to 46 percent, in the number  of Americans who disapprove of Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, while the number who expressed support for the policy slipped to 52 percent from 56 percent.</p>
<P>
"I think it's going to go on forever,"  said Mike Gallagher, 34, an independent voter from Chicago.  "The U.S. opened a can of worms that should have never been opened in the first place."</p>
<P>
In Pensacola, Fla., Betty Enfinger, 59, a Republican, said: "I knew it was not going to be easy. Bush seemed to have a good game plan for the war. But things have gone very, very poorly after the war."</p>
<P>
Here in Omaha, Paul McGill, 39, an independent, said he supported the war, but added tersely: "I'd like to see the reins handed over. I would like to see an exit strategy — mapped out in detail."</p>
<P>
At that, his wife, Virginia, who did not support the war, sighed. "I think we are locked in, and I don't see any way out," she said.</p>
<P>
Several pollsters said that shifts in public mood could prove to be transitory in an era of abrupt swings in opinion and might have been accelerated by Mr. Bush's call last Sunday for $87 billion to finance the war effort. Indeed, the mood could certainly change again if, say, images of random shootings  in Baghdad are overtaken by the capture of Saddam Hussein or the recovery of unconventional weapons.</p>
<P>
Despite any signs of apprehension, support for the war still remains solid. Sandra Johnson, 50, of Oak Creek, Colo., an independent who voted for Bush, said she was not surprised by how long it was taking. "Things just don't happen that quickly," she said. "They can't get in and accomplish all that and get out, as history has dictated in other wars."</p>
<P>
Still, the pollsters said  these recent indications of concern could be the leading edge of a reassessment of a war that once enjoyed major support and of a new round of questioning whether it was worth the cost and casualties. Such a development could prove problematic for President Bush going into an election year.</p>
<P>
"It's my impression that the public is in the midst of a change of mind," said Andrew M. Greeley, a prominent Catholic sociologist with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. "They still support in general the Iraqi war. But they don't believe the Iraqi war is central to the war on terror, and they are finally really not sure that they are ever going to get out of Iraq."</p>
<P>
Richard N. Smith, a Republican political historian and director of the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, said of  the Bush administration:  "My sense is that they may be paying a price, short term or not, about not being more explicit about the possible costs and long-term commitments that, quote, rebuilding, unquote, Iraq would necessarily require. They needed to do a much better job of explaining what the $87 billion is for. I think it shocked people."</p>
<P>
Against this backdrop, there is evidence that the steps Mr. Bush took a week ago to try to arrest any decline in support for the war — delivering a prime-time speech and requesting $87 billion to pay for its aftermath — might not have had the desired effect.  The Post/ABC News poll also found that 6 out of 10 Americans did not support the proposal. The poll surveyed 1,104 adults from Sept. 10 through Sept. 13, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
<P>
Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who gathered new  data after Mr. Bush's speech, said this might prove to be the first time  a major address by Mr. Bush had not  turned the public's mood toward him.</p>
<P>
"People are very disturbed," Mr. Greenberg said. "This was not a confidence-building speech."</p>
<P>
The developments have clear implications for the presidential race. The candidates have been attacking the war effort with language that would have been unthinkable even two weeks ago.</p>
<P>
In Indianola, Iowa, on Saturday night, at a steak fry attended by  most of the Democratic presidential candidates, Senator Bob Graham of Florida invoked the image of Vietnam by using a word, quagmire, that has become synonymous with that long and ultimately losing struggle.</p>
<P>
"What we have is a quagmire which today is costing every American $1 billion a week," he  said to cheers. </p>
<P>
Historians and sociologists said  comparisons with Vietnam were overblown, at least for now. For one thing, that conflict was far longer and deadlier:  the Iraq war has produced fewer than a hundredth of the combat deaths of Vietnam. For another, there has been no evidence of the breakdown of confidence in the government that was  intertwined with opposition to Vietnam.</p>
<P>
"You hear a lot of sentiments that this could turn into Vietnam if not handled correctly," said Mark Penn, who was a pollster for Bill Clinton in the White House and is now working for the presidential campaign of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. "But we're not in the same mood as we were in the 60's. Now, most people are more oriented to terrorism; most people want to win the war on terrorism."</p>
<P>
Allan J. Lichtman, a historian at American University, said: "The American people are nervous. There are substantial numbers who thought that things are not going well, that this was not planned well. But I don't see that this is front and center yet.  It's tragic what is going on, but the casualties are not large enough yet."</p>
<P>
Still, the comparison was raised frequently in interviews.</p>
<P>
"It's a disaster — it will get worse and worse and we will leave the same way we left Vietnam: with our tail between our legs," Frank Jessoe, 60, a former Marine who served in Vietnam and voted for Ross Perot in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000, said  in Laguna Beach.</p>
<P>
Gary Sambrowski, 54, a Democrat and an investment counselor  in Denver, said: "I get the feeling it's another Vietnam over there. We just can't walk away — we're stuck now."</p>
<P>
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said that concern  was not the same as opposition to the war or criticism of Mr. Bush. He said there had been no change over the summer in the number of people in his polls who said the war was a good idea: just over 60 percent.</p>
<P>
"America should be concerned, they ought to be worried," he said. "But what is important is that you can be worried and concerned and a little shaky about what's going on over there, but understand, the exact same percentage of people say it's a good idea as three or four months ago."</p>
<P>
Several analysts suggested that Mr. Bush's call for more money had turned into a catalyst, fortifying existing opposition while stirring concern among supporters of the war. </p>
<P>
"I think it's a real big waste of money," said Hele Spivack, 53, a Democrat and jewelry designer who was having brunch at the French Café in Omaha. "We should be taking care of our own people, we are not the policemen of the world." </p>
<P>
But at this point, supporters and opponents of the war said that spending the money was the unavoidable cost of putting an end to the conflict.</p>
<P>
"Bush obviously made a mistake in coming back and saying the war is over and underestimating Saddam and his loyalists over there," said Phillip Ruland, 46,  of Laguna Beach. "I think that we're going through a rough patch over there, but we've got to stay the course. I don't think it's going to be a Vietnam-type situation. It's totally different. It was a necessary war."</p>
