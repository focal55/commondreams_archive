<p>PARIS/MOSCOW  - France and Russia on Friday joined  U.N. boss Kofi Annan in criticizing a U.S. draft resolution  aimed at coaxing more troops and cash from reluctant allies to  help rebuild Iraq.<P>
"Our first impression is...this revised project does not  incorporate the change in approach that we are advocating,"  said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Herve Ladsous.<P>

  </table></font>France wants a provisional Iraqi government set up as soon  as possible, gradually receiving executive powers in a process  overseen by the United Nations.<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday the U.S.  draft was unsatisfactory, but held out hope for a compromise.<P>
"So far we are dissatisfied with the resolution proposed by  our U.S. partners," he said in answer to a question at a forum  in Moscow.<P>
The comments by France and Russia, both of whom hold a veto  on the U.N. Security Council, followed criticism of U.S. policy  in postwar Iraq by U.N. Secretary-General Annan on Thursday.<P>
Annan made clear to Security Council ambassadors that the  United Nations could not play a proper political role in Iraq  under terms wanted by the United States, U.N. officials and  diplomats said.<P>
  <b>ANNAN CRITICIZES U.S. DRAFT</b>
<P>
While not refusing outright to participate in the political  process, Annan said the U.S. draft envisaged an impossible U.N.  role.<P>
It was one of the few times during his five years in the  job that Annan had opposed Washington so bluntly on a crucial  issue.<P>
Before President Bush launched a war in March to topple  former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, France and Russia mounted a  campaign to keep him from securing U.N. backing.<P>
U.S.-led forces, primarily American and British, went to  war without a U.N. resolution in support of their action and  ousted Saddam in April.<P>
Postwar occupation forces have faced persistent guerrilla  ambushes and bomb attacks which have killed more than 80 U.S.  soldiers since major combat ended on May 1.<P>
Bomb attacks have killed Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim,  whose Shi'ite party was in a U.S.-sponsored Governing Council,  and more than 80 of his followers as well as top U.N. official  Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 other people in Baghdad in  August.<P>
Thousands of Iraqis thronged the holy city of Najaf on  Friday for a ceremony mourning Hakim.<P>
Postwar turmoil pushed Bush back to the United Nations to  seek troops and cash to help control and rebuild the oil-state  of 26 million people but he has faced concerted opposition.<P>
Ladsous said France's criticism of the U.S. approach in  Iraq "is shared by a good number of countries, including those  in the Security Council." He reiterated France did not intend  to use its veto to block a new U.S. resolution.<P>
  <b>NEW CONSTITUTION</b>
<P>
A leading member of Iraq's Governing Council said on Friday  the country's new constitution should be drawn up by an elected  committee -- a move that could drag out the process far longer  than Washington wants.<P>
Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who represents an influential Shi'ite  party on the U.S.-appointed Governing Council, said that once  the constitution was written it should be approved by a  national referendum before being adopted.<P>
His comments were another blow for U.S. efforts to secure a  resolution giving the United Nations a broader mandate in Iraq,  with France and Germany, who opposed the war, wanting a quick  handover of power to Iraqis.<P>
Secretary of State Colin Powell had said he hoped an Iraqi  constitution could be ready in six months, paving the way for  elections to select a sovereign government.<P>
  <b>BUSH'S OTHER WOES</b>
<P>
Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair also face  political pressure over the failure to find any weapons of mass  destruction, their main justification for the war.<P>
David Kay, the CIA official leading the hunt, told  lawmakers in Washington on Thursday that no conclusive proof  had been found that Saddam had chemical and biological weapons.<P>
A CBS News/New York Times poll released on Thursday found  that most Americans -- 53 percent -- believed the Iraq war was  not worth it and that Bush's approval ratings were near a  record low for his presidency.<P>
