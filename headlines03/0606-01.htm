</table>``There is no reliable information on whether Iraq is
producing and stockpiling chemical weapons, or whether Iraq has --
or will -- establish its chemical warfare agent production
facilities,&#39;&#39; a report by the Defense Intelligence Agency said in
a summary page obtained by Bloomberg News.          </p>
       <p> The unreleased report said Iraq ``probably&#39;&#39; had stockpiles
of banned chemicals, a more tentative conclusion than Rumsfeld was
presenting in public remarks. Iraq has ``amassed large,
clandestine stockpiles of chemical weapons, including VX, sarin
and mustard gas,&#39;&#39; he told Congress on Sept. 19.          </p>
       <p> The summary from the report suggests ``substantially more
uncertainty than was stated by senior administration officials,&#39;&#39;
said Kenneth Katzman, a specialist on Iraq&#39;s military for the
nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, who was told of the
contents by Bloomberg.          </p>
       <p> No banned weapons have been found in Iraq. Lawmakers in the
U.S. and the U.K. are demanding to know more about the
intelligence cited as a reason for invading the Middle East
country in March.          </p>
       <p> <b>Biological Weapons </b> </p>
       <p> The Defense Intelligence Agency&#39;s uncertainty about Iraqi
weapons extended to germ warfare programs, the summary suggests.
``Iraq is assessed to possess biological agent stockpiles that may
be weaponized and ready for use,&#39;&#39; its report said. ``The size of
those stockpiles is uncertain and is subject to debate. The nature
and condition of those stockpiles also are unknown.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> ``The DIA report suggests that before the Iraq War, the U.S.
intelligence community did not have hard evidence that Saddam
Hussein possessed large stocks of chemical and biological warfare
agents that posed an imminent threat to U.S. national security,&#39;&#39;
said Jonathan Tucker, a senior research fellow at the U.S.
Institute for Peace and a former United Nations weapons inspector,
also informed of the summary page contents by Bloomberg.          </p>
       <p> The Defense Intelligence Agency&#39;s findings in the report,
``Iraq: Key Weapons Facilities -- An Operational Support Study,&#39;&#39;
are similar to those of other DIA reports on Iraq&#39;s suspect
weapons programs, a U.S. military intelligence official said.          </p>
       <p> Existence of the study was disclosed by U.S. News &amp; World
Report in its June 9 edition.          </p>
       <p> <b>Blix Criticizes U.S. Data </b> </p>
       <p> Hans Blix, the UN&#39;s chief arms inspector, criticized the
quality of intelligence about alleged Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction given to him by the U.S. and the U.K.          </p>
       <p> Inspectors found nothing when they followed up U.S. and U.K.
leads at suspected Iraqi weapons sites, Blix said in an interview
aired today by British Broadcasting Corp. radio. He yesterday
presented his final report on Iraq to the UN Security Council.          </p>
       <p> ``Only in three of those cases did we find anything at all,
and in none were there any weapons of mass destruction, and that
shook me a bit, I must say,&#39;&#39; Blix told the BBC. ``I thought: My
God, if this is the best intelligence they have and we find
nothing, what about the rest?&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> Scott Ritter, an American who headed UN arms inspection teams
from 1991 to 1998, said in an interview today with Switzerland&#39;s
daily Le Temps that the U.S. and the U.K. should admit they lied
about Iraqi weapons. Ritter said allied haven&#39;t found evidence of
biological, chemical or nuclear arms programs ``because it&#39;s
impossible to find something that doesn&#39;t exist.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> <b>Judgments Defended </b> </p>
       <p> Rumsfeld and other U.S. officials say the weapons will be
found after the allies locate people from Hussein&#39;s regime who
know where they&#39;re hidden. Some officials, including Rumsfeld,
have said Hussein may have shipped the weapons out of Iraq or
destroyed them.          </p>
       <p> CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said yesterday that agency
director George Tenet stands by his Feb. 12 statement to Congress
that ``stockpiles of things he (Hussein) has not declared and
weapons he has not declared&#39;&#39; will be found.          </p>
       <p> U.S. defense officials on Wednesday defended pre-war
judgments, such as those in the September 2002 report, as
consistent with statements made by officials in the administration
of President George W. Bush&#39;s predecessor, President Bill Clinton.          </p>
       <p> ``It&#39;s pretty clear that the intelligence judgments
concerning Iraq weapons of mass destruction did not undergo a
major change between the Clinton and Bush administrations,&#39;&#39;
Undersecretary for Policy Douglas Feith told reporters at a
Pentagon press conference in Arlington, Virginia.          </p>
       <p> <b>CIA Review </b> </p>
       <p> The CIA is reviewing its pre-war assessment to determine
whether it overstated the threat posed by Hussein&#39;s weapons in
response to Pentagon ``hawks&#39;&#39; who favored a war, the New York
Times reported Wednesday. The Washington Post said yesterday some
CIA analysts felt pressure from Vice President Dick Cheney and his
top aide, Lewis Libby. Cheney&#39;s office declined to comment, the
Post said.          </p>
       <p> In the U.K., Prime Minister Tony Blair is under pressure to
produce evidence underpinning his assertions that Iraq possessed
weapons of mass destruction that justified going to war. Blair
said yesterday that he would produce ``all&#39;&#39; that evidence and he
repeated denials that he embellished it.          </p>
       <p> U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on Feb. 5 gave the
United Nations transcripts of intercepted telephone and radio
communications, satellite photographs and statements from Iraqi
defectors that he said proved Iraq had an active program of banned-
weapons production. The war began six weeks later.
