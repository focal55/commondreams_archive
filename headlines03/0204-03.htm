<p>MADRID, Feb. 3 — Prime Minister José María Aznar of Spain, one of Europe's staunchest supporters of President Bush's policy on Iraq, is being attacked at home for his stand, with the opposition Socialist Party rejecting a plea for unity in the face of war. </p>
<P> On Sunday the prime minister held a secret meeting with the Socialists' leader, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, but failed to persuade him to support the government's position on Iraq.</p>
<P> Officials told reporters that Mr. Aznar wanted to build a cross-party consensus on the issue, noting that his Popular Party, in opposition during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, had backed the Socialist government's support for military action. But Mr. Rodríguez told reporters today that Mr. Aznar had asked him three times for "unconditional support for Bush" and that "three times I told him I could not do that." </p>
<P> He said the present situation could not be compared to the gulf war since Iraq had broken international law by invading Kuwait and at this point the United States was taking "unilateral" action.</p>
<P> "I told him the Socialist Party does not support a preventive attack on Iraq," he said at a news conference, "because there are no causes and reasons to justify an action of this magnitude." He added that by mobilizing against the war people could help to ensure that "resolutions are complied with, that the inspectors can work and that we can avoid disproportionate and unjustified military action."</p>
<P> The Socialists also oppose Mr. Aznar's stand because they say it is harming the European Union, which is painfully divided over how to disarm Iraq. Mr. Aznar and eight other European leaders signed an op-ed article last week supporting Mr. Bush, but France and Germany were conspicuous by their absence.</p>
<P> In Barcelona today, Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, urged his European Union colleagues to resolve their differences if they wished to exert any influence over the issue. "If we don't speak with a single voice, our voice won't exist and nobody will hear us," he said.</p>
<P> The prime minister accused the opposition of "opportunism" and "rancid isolationism." The Socialist Party, he said, was "power hungry," "lacked statesmanship" and was "not ready to assume its responsibilities." </p>
<P> Mr. Aznar's anger may be stoked by concern that, although his staunch defense of Washington plays well in the United States, it is losing him ground at home. He will be stepping down in 2004, but his party faces important local elections in May.</p>
<P> Opinion polls consistently show that around 70 percent of Spaniards oppose war with Iraq.</p>
