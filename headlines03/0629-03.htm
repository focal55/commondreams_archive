<p>PARIS  - Radical French farmer-protester  Jose Bove, arrested last Sunday for destroying genetically  modified crops, said over the weekend he would not kneel down  before French President Jacques Chirac to win his freedom.<p></p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

Supporters of jailed French farmer Jose Bove, sporting false mustache's and pipes in emulation of Bove, demonstrate in front of a McDonalds restaurant in central Paris, June 25, 2003. Jose Bove was arrested at his home June 22, 2003 and taken to prison to serve a 10-month sentence for destroying genetically modified plants. The demonstrators briefly blocked the entrance to the McDonalds restaurant with a banner and handed out sandwiches made of freshly baked bread and French salami as an alternative to the fast food.

</table></font>France's justice minister hinted last week that Bove could  win a presidential pardon on July 14, the national Bastille Day  holiday and a traditional day of amnesty in France.<p></p> But in an interview with French daily Le Monde, Bove said he  was not looking for any favours from the government and that if  he was freed it would be due to public outrage at his detention.<p></p> &quot;I always said, ever since I was convicted, that I would not  get down on my knees before President Chirac,&quot; Bove said from  prison, in a written response to questions from the newspaper.<p></p> &quot;If I was given the opportunity to go free I would not say  no, but let's be clear. My freedom would be the result of the  protest movement and that alone.&quot;<p></p> The walrus-moustached Bove, who gained fame in the 1990s for  his attacks on globalisation and trashing a McDonald's  restaurant, was arrested last Sunday by police who smashed their  way into his rural home near the southern city of Montpellier.<p></p> They bundled him into a helicopter and flew him to a nearby  prison to serve a 10-month sentence, handed down last November  after a conviction for ripping up genetically modified rice and  maize plants in separate incidents in 1998 and 1999.<p></p> Bove, the spokesman for the radical Confederation Paysanne  farmers' union, had refused to give himself up.<p></p> Several thousand protesters marched on Saturday in the  central French town of Millau, demanding his freedom.<p></p> French Justice Minister Dominique Perben told French radio  last week that it was &quot;not impossible&quot; that Chirac would grant  the activist a pardon on July 14.<p></p> But in an interview with French weekly Le Journal du  Dimanche on Sunday, the head of Chirac's conservative party and  former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe suggested Bove was  getting what he deserved.<p></p> &quot;I understand that with a reduced sentence he could stay in  prison until September,&quot; Juppe said. &quot;Is that unthinkable for  someone who has destroyed, on several occasions, the property of  fellow citizens?&quot;<p></p> 
Bove and his followers say genetically modified plants could  trigger the spread of modified genes harmful to the environment.  Supporters say they could lead to the development of hardier  grains to help feed the world's poor.
