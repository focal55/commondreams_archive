<p>PUTRAJAYA, MALAYSIA -- The world's Muslims opened a major conference here with calls for the United States to set a timetable for leaving Iraq, fierce condemnation of Israel and anger over their treatment since the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>The three themes were highlighted by speakers at the opening session of a meeting of foreign ministers of the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) preparing for a summit of heads of state on Thursday.</p>

  </table></font>Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al-Thani of Qatar, which has held the OIC chairmanship since the last summit three years ago, told the opening session that Muslim states needed to push for "a specific timetable for ending the occupation" of Iraq.</p>
<p>Syed Hamid Albar, foreign minister of the incoming OIC chairman, Malaysia, said "foreign occupation of the country must be brought to an end as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"The occupying powers must work in earnest on a timetable for a democratically elected government to be installed within a reasonably prompt timeframe," with the United Nations playing a central role, he said.</p>
<p>Conference sources told AFP, however, that it appeared from meetings behind closed doors that a resolution on Iraq to be presented by heads of state would not go into specifics.</p>
<p>"It will proclaim attachment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, call for swift empowerment of the Iraqis and a quick end to occupation," an Arab diplomat said.</p>
<p>The controversial issue of member-state Turkey's decision to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq alongside US forces had not been put formally on the table, he said, but the overwhelming majority of states would oppose the deployment without a UN mandate.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Governing Council also opposes the plan, which it fears might interfere with domestic politics and impede the already fragile efforts to rebuild the war-torn country.</p>
<p>There was total agreement, however, over resolutions condemning Israel for its strike on an alleged militant base in Syria a week ago and "aggression" towards the Palestinians, the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Speakers at the opening session had singled out the situation in the Middle East as a priority for the summit.</p>
<p>"This blatant act of aggression against Syria, a fellow member of the OIC, must be condemned in the strongest terms as provocative, arrogant and dangerous," said Syed Hamid.</p>
<p>He also condemned Israeli incursions into Palestinian areas and called on Israel to drop any plans to deport or kill Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, saying his assassination would be "clearly an act of state terrorism."</p>
<p>Turning to the upheaval in global politics since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, he said the Muslim world was facing "great challenges".</p>
<p>"The threats of unilateralism, globalization and terrorism, the precarious situation in the Middle East and the uncertain future in Iraq, to name a few, have only served to threaten our very survival."</p>
<p>OIC secretary general Abdelouahed Belkeziz took the same line, saying: "We meet under conditions that are full with challenges and dangers unprecedented in the contemporary history of the Islamic nation."</p>
<p>"Islam itself is being accused in its culture, civilization and speech.</p>
<p>"Muslims are filled with feelings of impotence and frustration as some of their countries are occupied, others are under sanctions, a third group threatened and a fourth group accused of sponsoring terrorism."</p>
<p>The conference is taking place amid tight security in Malaysia's new administrative capital of Putrajaya south of Kuala Lumpur, with more than 8,000 armed police and soldiers on duty, backed by helicopters overhead and launches patrolling the many lakes in the area.</p>
