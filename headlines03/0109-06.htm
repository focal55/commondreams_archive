<p>San Francisco, long a stronghold of the Democratic Party, got a jolt 
Wednesday when Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez made history by landing the 
powerful post of Board of Supervisors president.
<P>"This sends a very strong message about the ascension of progressives, and 
particularly the Greens," said Ross Mirkarimi, a San Francisco-based political 
consultant who was a founding member of the state's Green Party.
<P>"Nationally speaking, Matt Gonzalez will be one of the highest-ranking 
(Green Party) officeholders in the United States when you look at the scale of 
the populace he represents," Mirkarimi said. "This is very significant and 
very symbolic."
<P>The board president, elected by the supervisors, makes committee 
assignments, orchestrates the movement of legislation and, if effective, 
builds a majority coalition to pass laws. It's the second most powerful job in 
City Hall, after mayor. The job will put the soft-spoken but passionate Texas 
native, who at times has gone out of his way to avoid media attention, into a 
high-profile role.
<P>After a grueling battle, Gonzalez beat out two Democratic colleagues, 
Supervisors Aaron Peskin and Sophie Maxwell, for the presidency. The winner 
had to secure at least six votes on the board -- the bare majority -- which 
Gonzalez finally pulled off on the seventh round of voting once Peskin dropped 
out and broke the deadlock.
<P>Gonzalez, a brainy former deputy public defender who represents the 
liberal Haight-Ashbury and surrounding neighborhoods that make up District 5, 
abandoned the Democratic Party two years ago, right before he won a four-year 
term on the board.
<P>The office of supervisor in San Francisco is nonpartisan.
<P>Gonzalez's election as board president was not, obviously, made along party 
lines. Nine of the 11 supervisors are Democrats, and some of the Democratic 
Party's heavy hitters, most notably state Senate President John Burton, 
lobbied against Gonzalez, not wanting to see the elevation of a Green.
<P>Gonzalez, 37, said the race for president wasn't about party affiliation, 
but about who could best lead the board. Still, he acknowledged, his Green 
Party credentials shouldn't be ignored.
<P>"It's significant for the party because it shows that someone elected in 
the party can gain a leadership post," he said.
<P>Jane Morrison, chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party, was reluctant 
to comment on the Gonzalez victory.
<P><b>DEMOCRATS DISAPPOINTED</b>
<P>"You'd think that with nine Democrats on the board, they would have voted 
Democratic," is all she would say.
<P>City Treasurer Susan Leal, a Democrat and mayoral hopeful, said that "in 
some ways as a Democrat it's disappointing. But on the other hand, it puts the 
Green Party on the spot. Now they have to show what they can do with 
leadership instead of just being the protest party."
<P>Voters in Maine recently elected a Green to their state Assembly, and 
Greens have been elected mayor in smaller cities, including Santa Monica. In 
San Francisco, two Greens serve on the Board of Education.
<P>The Greens showed strength in San Francisco in the November governor's race 
when their candidate, Peter Camejo, garnered 15 percent of the vote -- far 
short of the 66 percent that went to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, but for the 
first time slightly ahead of the Republican candidate, Bill Simon.
<P>Gonzalez said he would focus on issues that improve city services and 
government accountability and, without stating specifics, forward a 
progressive agenda. Looming over everything, however, is the projected $200 
million budget defict the city faces.
<P>During his tenure as supervisor, Gonzalez floated the idea of enacting a 
local minimum wage in San Francisco and supported efforts to raise the real 
estate transfer tax on high-priced properties. He led the charge against 
allowing the 49ers to sell the naming rights to Candlestick Park, a city-owned 
stadium, and has proposed limiting cars in Golden Gate Park on Saturdays.
<P><b>VOCAL CRITIC OF MAYOR</b>
<P>He has been a vocal critic of Mayor Willie Brown's administration, pushing 
plans to reduce Brown's cadre of special assistants and to blunt the mayor's 
control over certain city commissions and the Department of Elections.
<P>To win the job, Gonzalez had support from the left and the right. His 
original votes were from himself and Supervisors Tony Hall, Gerardo Sandoval 
and Chris Daly.
<P>Maxwell had herself and Supervisors Gavin Newsom and Bevan Dufty. Peskin's 
camp included himself, outgoing board President Tom Ammiano and Supervisors 
Jake McGoldrick and Fiona Ma.
<P>After the sixth round of voting, Peskin backed out. Ammiano and Ma switched 
to Maxwell; Peskin and McGoldrick voted for Gonzalez, giving him the win.
