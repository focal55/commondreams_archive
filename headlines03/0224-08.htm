<p>Some musicians say they were warned not to use the Grammy podium to make anti-war statements, but show organizers deny any effort to stifle the artists. </p>
<p>Sheryl Crow, who simply wore a guitar strap that read "No War," along with a peace sign necklace, was asked backstage why she didn't speak out against a possible military action in Iraq.
<P>
"I was," she told reporters. "But then the Grammy Committees called my manager and asked if I was going to show up with any antics. They prefer to keep it neutral."
<P>
However, Grammy president Neil Portnow categorically denied that his organization contacted any of the artists regarding their plans. "Absolutely not," he said. "I categorically deny it. Not true."
<P>
A representative from CBS, which broadcast the festivities, echoed Portnow's statement, and commented directly on Crow's contention. "That was a bunch of baloney," the representative said. 
<P>
 "We absolutely believe in freedom of expression."

<P>

But other artists also say there were plans to stifle the artists. Peter Gabriel told reporters he'd heard that anyone who planned to speak out against the war would be censored. David Grohl of the Foo Fighters also said he had heard of some sort of directive.

 <P><b>From Ashanti to Durst, Large and Small Statements</b><P>
Rumors of a clampdown spread when anti-war activist Susan Sarandon, who'd been on the list of presenters, didn't appear at the show. 
<P>

Still, other artists made statements large and small. Presenter Bonnie Raitt said "let's build some peace" before handing out an award.    
<P>
Another presenter, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said, "This war should go away as soon as possible."
<P>
Guitarist Wayne Coyne of Flaming Lips wore a bandage on his face and alternately told people it was due to an anti-war protest or that Justin Timberlake beat him up.
<P>

No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani wore a halter top with the word "love" &#151; along with combat fatigue hot pants.
<P>

Even Ashanti, who caused a stir when the dress she wore on stage seemed almost see-through, had an eye on international affairs, saying that she saw troops in San Diego shipping out. "It's such a sad thing to see so many young men &#133; having to go out and fight the war."
<P>

Backstage, a member of the hip-hop group The Roots, which backed Eminem, wore a T-shirt with a picture of President Bush on it, along with the words "American Psycho."
<P>

After the show, Durst said he made the right decision to speak out. "I heard a lot of people say we're going to do it, but I didn't think anybody would and I'm happy I did," he said.
<P>
 "I'm happy to be alive and I love my son and I just want it [the threat of war] to go away."
<P>
It would be a mischaracterization to say artists were outright criticizing United States policy. "I think that, like most people, you'd like to think that there's an alternative to war and so  I'm a peace-loving guy," said Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters.
<P>
 "Man, I'd hate to see anyone go out and lose their life for something that might not be worth it."
<P>
Crow said she didn't feel she was compromising her principles by not addressing the war directly.
<P>
 "I didn't feel like picking that bone tonight," she said. "I think it's in everybody's hearts and consciousness. A lot of people have been outspoken about it obviously in the press room &#133; Everybody thinks we should be talking about peace."
<P>
Whatever happens in the coming week, Double Grammy winner Indie.Arie says that artists will be responsible to express themselves. "I hope it opens our eyes and that we start to look at things for what they are and make changes," she said.
<P>

Norah Jones, the evening's big Grammy winner, took time out from one of her victory speeches to contemplate the state of affairs. "In a time in the world that's really weird," she said, "I feel really blessed."
