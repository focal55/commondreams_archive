<p>They had talked the anti-war talk, but when the threat of an attack on 
Iraq seemed imminent, Alice Cannan and Phil Meymand decided their family would 
walk the walk.
<P>The couple dressed their two children in homemade vests with painted peace 
signs and other anti-war slogans, left their home in Oakland's Rockridge 
district and joined the peace marches around the Bay Area.

</table></font>Cannan, 39, was exhilarated. Her whole family was standing in righteous 
solidarity against what she was convinced would be an unjust war. Then, her 4-
year-old daughter, Leila, tapped her.
<P>"Mommy," she said, "is Saddam Hussein a boy or a girl?"
<P>It was a comment that elicited some chuckles, but it also brought a little 
perspective to the anti-war movement. Unlike the 1960s student protests, war 
demonstrations today are, as often as not, family affairs.
<P>Cannan and Meymand, with their 4- and 6-year-old daughters, are part of a 
growing "stroller brigade" that has created a new dynamic in the anti-war 
movement.
<P>They are helping introduce political action to a new generation.
<P>"I thought (the question) was funny, but it made me understand that you 
have to be careful about what you're saying to children because their 
interpretations can be so different," Cannan said. "We were going along 
thinking she understood things and then realized that she really didn't."
<P>Cannan and Meymand are highly educated, upper middle-class professional 
parents with mostly liberal, democratic ideals. They oppose war in Iraq and 
have taken an active role in fighting the Bush administration's battle plans. 
The couple's newfound activism is a first for the Cannan-Meymand family. They 
have joined other couples and their children at several protest marches and 
intend to join the demonstrations once the war gets under way.
<P>Meymand, 41, said the Bush administration's relationship with the United 
Nations was what prompted him and his wife to get involved.
<P>"The U.S. is continually changing the definition of what is an acceptable 
outcome," Meymand said. "At first it was eliminate weapons of mass destruction, and now it's regime change. Saying, 'Hey, we don't like this government, so 
we're going to change it,' is a very dangerous precedent to set."
<P>Meymand and Cannan came to the Bay Area in 1993 so Meymand could get a 
master's degree at UC Berkeley. He ended up getting a Ph.D. in civil and 
environmental engineering and now works as a geotechnical engineer for a large 
firm in Oakland.
<P>Cannan, who has a master's degree in nursing from Boston College, is a 
women's health practitioner in Berkeley.
<P>Both grew up in politically charged environments, Meymand in Massachusetts 
and Cannan in Pennsylvania.
<P>Meymand's father was an Iranian naval officer who divorced and returned to 
Iran when Meymand was barely a year old. His mother, who was in the U.S. Navy, 
raised him alone.
<P>Meymand said his father had been exiled to the United States after the Shah 
of Iran was deposed, but he never got to know him very well. And anyway, he 
said, his concern about the Middle East has nothing to do with his father. He 
said he had been interested in politics since prep school, eventually majoring 
in political science at Georgetown.
<P>Cannan was the 10th of 13 siblings in a Catholic family. She was born in 
Lesotho, Africa, where her father, a long-haired, bearded history professor, 
taught school. The family eventually moved to a Philadelphia suburb, where her 
parents got involved in union and anti-war activities.
<P>"They always joked that they were the first hippies," Cannan said. "I don't 
know if I ever went to a peace march during the Vietnam War, but there are 
pictures of my father at peace marches."
<P>Cannan said her parents had instilled in her from an early age the notion 
that all people are special in their own way.
<P>"Certainly that influenced me," she said. "I believe in open dialogue and 
understanding. I'm not sure I'm a pacifist. I just really don't believe in war."
<P>Neither Cannan nor Meymand was actively opposed to the first Gulf War, but 
Meymand had misgivings.
<P>"It was hypocritical for the U.S. to support and arm Saddam Hussein 
throughout the 1980s and never raise any objections to his comments about 
reclaiming lost territories and then, suddenly, declare war," he said. "I 
guess we had no options, but it's another example of all our mistakes coming 
home to roost."
<P>Meymand said what he sees as foreign policy mistakes are still roosting, 
but the situation is different.
<P>"Back then, we let things get out of control, and Saddam Hussein invaded 
another country," he said. "The difference now is that he has been contained, 
and I object to this notion of pre-emption. I don't think Hussein poses a 
danger to us or his neighbors."
<P>But regardless of the outcome of the conflict, Meymand and Cannan hope 
their activism will teach their children valuable lessons that they will 
eventually use to make the world a better place.
<P>Leila, at least, may actually know more about politics than spelling. 
"DON'T INVAD EIRAQ," reads the hand-painted paper bag vest she wears at 
rallies.
