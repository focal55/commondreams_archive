<p>The top US infantry commander in Iraq has said that his troops'
overstretched supply lines, coupled with unexpectedly stiff Iraqi
resistance, had stalled the advance on Baghdad and increased the
possibility of a long war. <P>Contradicting the upbeat assessments from the Pentagon, which
repeatedly insisted Operation Iraqi Freedom was on schedule,
Lieutenant General William Wallace said his troops had been taken
by surprise by Iraqi irregulars using guerrilla tactics.<P>"The enemy we're fighting is different from the one we'd war-gamed
against," said Lt Gen Wallace, the commander of the US army's V
Corps overseeing ground operations.<P>When asked whether the resistance would lead to a longer than
predicted war, he said: "It's beginning to look that way."<P>The off-message remarks brought to the surface unease among army
officials that the 300-mile supply lines between the leading US
forces and logistics bases in Kuwait are too vulnerable to mount a
decisive assault on Baghdad.<P>Troops of the 3rd Infantry Division spent much of the past week
fighting their way up the Euphrates, and have told journalists with
them that they are short of fuel and food.<P>The Washington Post also quoted army sources as expressing concern
at the gap opening up between the army, advancing along the west
bank of the Euphrates, and the US marines moving towards Kut
170km due east on the Tigris.<P>There were 125,000 coalition troops in Iraq as of yesterday,
25,000 of them British.<P>Another 40,000 were reported ready to move over the border from
Kuwait.<P>Some 60,000 US troops have deployment orders, but the first
batch, the 4th Infantry Division, is only due to be ready for battle in
mid-April.<P>Hours earlier, France's normally mild-mannered prime minister
Jean-Pierre Raffarin delivered a stinging attack on the campaign,
saying it could become a bloodbath.<P>Mr Raffarin said: "We were expecting a technological war, a quick
war, a 21st century war. And we have discovered a war that is
among the most horrible, like those of the 20th century.<P>"We are seeing there are major consequences in the horrors of a war
that is taking place before our very eyes, in conditions we did not
expect."<P>Equivalent views were expressed yesterday by the Iraqi regime. The
defense minister predicted that the siege of Baghdad could begin in
five days, but vowed that American soldiers would become entangled
in months of bloody street fighting.
<P>Sultan Hashim Ahmed was speaking in Baghdad as US infantry were
told to prepare for a potentially decisive battle in the next 72 hours
with the Republican Guard near the holy Shia city of Kerbala.<P>US warplanes and missiles destroyed communications and command
centers in the Iraqi capital before dawn this morning, the US central
command said. Reporters spoke of several thunderous explosions
early today, shaking the center of the city.
<P>The Iraqi minister was speaking a day after 1,000 US paratroopers
opened a northern front by landing on a Kurdish-held airfield.<P>The first response to the arrival of the 173rd Airborne Brigade
came last night with a surprise retreat by Iraqi forces from
positions defending the northern oil city of Kirkuk. Kurdish rebel
troops moved in quickly to take their trenches.<P>The brigade is there to allow tanks of the 1st Infantry Division to be
flown in, but US officials said that it was expected to be a light force
intended to deter Turkish intervention and perhaps secure northern
oilfields.<P>Nevertheless, Donald Rumsfeld, the US defense secretary, appeared
determined that the US infantry should take on the Republican
Guard's Medina Division dug in around Kerbala. The division was
subjected to near constant bombing yesterday as coalition planes
flew 600 sorties, taking advantage of the return of good weather.
<P>"I think it's only reasonable to expect that it will require the
coalition forces moving through some Republican Guard units and
destroying them or capturing them before you'll see the crumbling
of the regime," Mr Rumsfeld said.<P>The Pentagon's strategy of launching a lightning assault on Baghdad
with only one heavy infantry division, with two relatively light
airborne and marine divisions also available, also came under fire
in Washington and London yesterday.<P>Before the war, the CIA and the DIA (defense intelligence agency)
were reported to have warned Mr Rumsfeld that an invasion might
be met with tenacious guerrilla resistance.
<P>Those warnings were ignored in favor of more optimistic
assessments from Iraqi opposition exiles, according to a report in
the Washington Post. Meanwhile, serving and retired army officers
have privately warned that the US commander, Gen Tommy Franks,
did not have enough troops in reserve to protect his supply lines and
deal with the guerrilla threat.
<P>The 4th Infantry Division, originally earmarked for deployment in
Turkey, is due to begin arriving in Kuwait at the weekend, but their
tanks and artillery will still take up to three weeks to arrive by
ship. Asked whether Britain would send reinforcements to Iraq, the
British defense secretary, Geoff Hoon, replied: "We are absolutely
confident that we have sufficient forces in theatre to deliver the
military objectives that we set out."
<P>The Guardian has learned that an infantry brigade of some 5,000
troops is on standby if required.<P>Meanwhile, in the north near Mosul, the Iraqi soldiers who had been
encamped in bunkers overlooking the town of Chamchamal staged an
orderly withdrawal yesterday.<P>Their unexpected retreat illustrates the Iraqi army's growing
confidence that it can best defeat coalition forces by luring them into
Iraq's cities<P>The Iraqi defense minister told a news conference: "It will be no
surprise that in five to 10 days they &#91;US troops&#93; will be able to
encircle all our positions in Baghdad_ But they have to come into the
city eventually.
<P>"The enemy can bypass the resistance and go into the desert as far as
it wants. &#91;But&#93; in the end, where can he go? He has to enter the
city."</p>
