<p>Independent commentator Arianna Huffington said Monday she is strongly 
considering leaving the recall race, signaling a growing fear among the 
political left that Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger stands a good chance of 
becoming California's next governor.

      Arianna Huffington is worried the GOP will bring &quot;disastrous economic policies.&quot;<br>

    </tr>
  </table></font>Huffington, appearing at a campaign event in San Francisco, said she would 
decide as soon as today whether to urge her supporters to oppose the recall 
and possibly back Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante -- reflecting the view 
that in a close race, votes by progressives for Huffington and Green Party 
candidate Peter Camejo could help elect Schwarzenegger.
<P>"I'm talking to a lot of supporters and people who are part of the campaign.
<P>I'm going to make a decision later this week," she told reporters.
<P>"What is very important . . . is to make sure that the state does not go to 
a Republican who is going to bring to the state the same disastrous economic 
policies we have in Washington," she said. "That is a very important 
consideration."
<P>Huffington's potential exit highlights the changing dynamics of the race: 
Two weeks ago Bustamante, the only major Democrat on the recall replacement 
ballot, was seen as the top contender, and Huffington and Camejo were taking 
potshots at him. Schwarzenegger was struggling to unify GOP support amid a 
strong challenge by state Sen. Tom McClintock.
<P>Since then, Schwarzenegger has racked up endorsements by Republican leaders 
and is consolidating the GOP vote. Now all the major replacement candidates 
are targeting the actor-turned-candidate. Even Gov. Gray Davis' advisers are 
predicting Schwarzenegger will win the Oct. 7 recall replacement race.
<P><b>POLL QUESTIONED</b>
<P>A recent CNN/USA Today poll showed strong support for recalling Davis and a 
widening lead for Schwarzenegger. However, the poll's results have been hotly 
contested.
<P>The survey, conducted by Gallup and released Sunday, showed 63 percent of 
"probable" voters support the recall to 35 percent opposed. The survey also 
found Schwarzenegger leading with 40 percent, followed by Bustamante at 25 
percent, McClintock at 18 percent, Camejo with 5 percent and Huffington with 
just 2 percent.
<P>But the poll's results are based on the assumption that Republicans will 
comprise 47 percent of voters on Oct. 7 -- even though GOP registration in 
California is only 35 percent.
<P>More polls are expected to be released this week, including the Field Poll 
and one by the Los Angeles Times.
<P>Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, blasted the polls 
results as "outrageous," saying there's little chance Republicans will make up 
half of voters on election day.
<P>"It's the most irresponsible thing a pollster has ever done in the height 
of a campaign," Torres said. "If their intent was to depress Democrats, it may 
very well do that."
<P>When the poll tabulated the responses of "registered" voters, the margin 
fell to 55 percent in favor of the recall and 41 percent opposed -- 
essentially what other recent polls have shown.
<P>"It's still not good news for Davis," said pollster Mark Baldassare of the 
Public Policy Institute of California. "Whatever progress Davis has made since 
the recall went into effect in early August, it hasn't been enough to overcome 
the fact that a large proportion of voters who are likely to show up still 
don't like the job he's doing in office. It's becoming a very difficult thing 
to overcome."
<P>Davis won re-election last November with just 47 percent of the vote, but 
to avoid being recalled the governor needs to surpass the 50 percent mark.
<P><b>CAMEJO IN TO THE END</b>
<P>Camejo, in an interview Monday, said he's just as concerned as Huffington 
about Schwarzenegger becoming governor. But he said he has no intention of 
leaving the race or urging Green Party voters to vote no on the recall.
<P>"If some of my supporters decide to vote for Cruz, as a way to stop Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, I'm not angry at them," Camejo said.
<P>But he added, "I will stay in until the end. I want to use this last week 
to convince the base of the Democratic Party of how they have suffered because 
of the dysfunctional nature of the Democratic Party and its subservience to 
the same interests that fund the Republican Party."
<P>Camejo said Huffington had called him Monday to discuss her decision, and 
he's urging her to stay in the race.
<P>"If she stays in, she will be able to be far more outspoken about issues 
that she feels strongly about, such as preventing Arnold Schwarzenegger from 
being elected," he said.
<P><b>TOUGH DECISION</b>
<P>Huffington's decision to possibly exit the race is another sign of 
Schwarzenegger's strength. The TV commentator has spent weeks bashing 
Bustamante for taking money from Indian gaming tribes -- calling it "legalized 
bribery" -- but in last week's debate, she mostly attacked Schwarzenegger.
<P>Even some of her staunchest supporters, including donors and campaign 
staffers, are telling her she should consider quitting.
<P>"People are torn," said Van Jones, Huffington's statewide grassroots 
director and a longtime San Francisco activist. "Frankly, we're in a situation 
where we feel we have no good choices.
<P>"We don't want to do anything that would help Arnold Schwarzenegger pull 
off his right-wing coup. At the same time we don't want to compromise on our 
principles with regard to getting big money out of the system."
<P>Kevin Danaher, a co-founder of Global Exchange and friend of Huffington, 
wants Huffington to discuss a deal to endorse Bustamante in return for his 
agreeing to take up some of her ideas if he becomes governor.
<P><b>DEAL WITH BUSTAMANTE</b>
<P>"You can't make some quid pro quo where you say, 'I'll make you secretary 
of whatever,' " Danaher said. "But you can say: 'You know what my issues are, 
you know what my stand is. Maybe we can have some kind of understanding here?' 
"
<P>In fact, Bustamante appeared to curry Huffington's support during an Asian-
Pacific American forum Sunday in Sacramento, during which he pledged his 
support for her proposed initiative to publicly finance campaigns.
<P>But Bustamante adviser Richie Ross said there were "no conversations" about 
a deal to secure Huffington's endorsement.
<P>Huffington, at Monday's event in San Francisco, said Bustamante's donations 
from tribes and Schwarzenegger's corporate contributions are still "exhibit A" 
for a broken campaign financing system. But she praised Bustamante for 
endorsing her public financing proposal.
<P>"I believe in conversions -- I had one myself," said Huffington, who 
morphed from a Newt Gingrich Republican into a progressive.
