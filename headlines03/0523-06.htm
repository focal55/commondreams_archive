<p>Under pressure from Democrats to detail his role in the hunt for Texas 
      lawmakers, U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said Thursday that his 
      staff had asked the FAA to find former House Speaker Pete Laney's plane.
</p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a state judge ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety 
      not to destroy any more records about the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. DeLay, a Republican from Sugar Land, previously had acknowledged 
      only asking the Department of Justice to clarify what role, if any, 
      federal law enforcement might appropriately play in forcing Democratic 
      state legislators back to Austin. He has said the request was made on 
      behalf of Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, who had ordered state police 
      to find and retrieve the Democratic House members who had fled Austin to 
      block Mr. DeLay's plan to redraw congressional lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. DeLay said Thursday that his May 12 request for the whereabouts of 
      Mr. Laney's Piper Cheyenne went through ordinary Federal Aviation 
      Administration channels, and FAA officials later confirmed that anyone 
      armed with a tail number could have obtained the same information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. DeLay said that when an aide told him the plane was en route from 
      Ardmore, Okla., to an airport north of Austin, he passed the information 
      to Mr. Craddick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;There's been no contact by me or anyone on my staff with the DPS or 
      anyone else involved in the investigation of trying to track down these 
      Moses Roses,&quot; he said, comparing the AWOL Democrat state lawmakers to 
      the only Texian to flee the Alamo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Democrats assert that Mr. DeLay had directed &#8211; or at least inspired &#8211; 
      what they called a Watergate-like misuse of state and federal law 
      enforcement resources to settle a partisan feud, which he has denied.
    </p>
<p>
      They have also criticized the DPS for destroying all records of its 
      manhunt, questioning whether Mr. DeLay, Mr. Craddick or Gov. Rick Perry 
      had ordered or urged that agency to cover up an inappropriate use of law 
      enforcement resources.</p>
    <p>
      Mr. DeLay dismissed the suggestion, saying he had nothing to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Sounds like a bureaucratic screw-up to me,&quot; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he shrugged off the comparison to Watergate as partisan name-calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;It's typical,&quot; he said. &quot;Doesn't bother me.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Craddick and Mr. Perry also have rejected the Democrats' assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late Thursday, a state judge in Austin issued a temporary order barring 
      the destruction of any more DPS records in the case, at the request of 
      state Rep. Lon Burnham, D-Fort Worth. Travis County District Attorney 
      Ronnie Earle said he had begun an inquiry into the destruction of 
      records.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The questions include what records were destroyed, under what authority 
      and why the records were destroyed so quickly. DPS is cooperating with 
      the inquiry,&quot; Mr. Earle said in a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Full accounting</b>
    </p>
<p>
</p>
    For more than a week, Democrats have demanded a full accounting of Mr. 
    DeLay's role in the hunt, alleging that as the mastermind of 
    redistricting, he also may have been urging state authorities to tap 
    federal homeland security resources to track the Democratic quorum-busters.

    <p>
      In the early hours of the search, a DPS lieutenant called a federal 
      Homeland Security Department agency that tracks terrorists and 
      smugglers, seeking the whereabouts of Mr. Laney's plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late last week, Homeland Security officials released a partial 
      transcript of that call and said the DPS officer had misled them into 
      believing the plane had crashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. DeLay distanced himself from that call and all other steps state 
      police took, though he praised the DPS for doing a &quot;great job,&quot; saying, 
      &quot;I wasn't involved in anything that was going on down there [in Austin].&quot;

    </p>
    <p>
      Democrats have demanded a full transcript of the DPS call, saying that 
      would illuminate whether federal authorities were misused or acted in 
      good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday morning, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, testifying 
      before the House Homeland Security Committee, again declined to release 
      that transcript, citing an internal investigation by the department's 
      inspector general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;This is now potentially a criminal investigation. The tapes are part of 
      the evidentiary chain. We are involved in a criminal investigation 
      involving information and pieces of evidence that are not necessarily 
      available for public review right now,&quot; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten Democratic members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee have 
      written Mr. Ridge alleging that the document destruction amounted to an 
      obstruction of the Homeland Security Department's internal investigation 
      into the possible misuse of the nation's anti-terrorism assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Move called routine</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    In Austin and Washington, the political buzz continued over the DPS' 
    decision to destroy all records related to the hunt, a move the public 
    safety department said was required by federal privacy regulations.

    <p>
      Democratic Party officials handed out clippings of news stories about 
      the destruction, speaking in front of a large placard reading, &quot;TEXANS 
      DESERVE THE TRUTH: WHAT DID THEY DO? WHEN DID THEY DO IT?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;they&quot; referred to the state's entire Republican leadership, whom 
      Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm charged with &quot;coming 
      clean&quot; to another &quot;they,&quot; the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;They deserve the tapes. They deserve the documents. Most of all, they 
      deserve a thorough, independent investigation of this scandal,&quot; she said.

    </p>
    <p>
      A DPS spokesman said the document destruction was routine, ordered by 
      DPS brass without any consultation or input from politicians or anyone 
      else outside the agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Texas Senate on Thursday voted down a measure to require the DPS to 
      retain investigative documents for 60 days, offered as an amendment to a 
      government reorganization bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In related matter, a DPS spokeswoman said a Travis County prosecutor has 
      told the DPS that there was insufficient evidence to press charges in 
      the reported theft of a GOP redistricting map. A Craddick aide said that 
      an aide to U.S. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Arlington, took draft redistricting 
      maps from his briefcase, which he had left unattended in a Capitol 
      committee room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surveillance camera showed that Frost aide leaving the room with 
    documents.</p><p align="center">&copy;2003 Belo Interactive</p>
