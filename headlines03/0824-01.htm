<p>CRAWFORD, Texas &#8211; The ongoing, emotional debate over Iraq came to 
    President Bush's doorstep Saturday.

    <p>
      While protesters near the presidential ranch in Crawford urged that 
      American troops be brought home from Iraq, Mr. Bush called the troops' 
      effort there a major offensive in the war on terrorism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;There will be no flinching in this war on terror, and there will be no 
      retreat,&quot; Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address.
    </p>

</table></font>Among those gathering at the local football stadium to denounce both Mr. 
      Bush and the war, four days after a terrorist bombing at the U.N. 
      headquarters in Baghdad, were relatives of troops.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      &quot;George Bush does not support our soldiers,&quot; said Candance Robison, 
      whose husband is an Army lieutenant in Iraq. &quot;He lies to our nation and 
      our soldiers about our reasons for going to war. He makes thoughtless 
      statements like, 'Bring 'em on' to the Saddam loyalists who target our 
      troops.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ms. Robison is part of Military Families Speak Out, one of the groups 
      that sponsored the protest. Veterans for Peace also helped organize the 
      rally, which drew about 100 people.
    </p>
    <p>
      As songs were sung and speeches delivered, the critics carried signs 
      that read: &quot;Bush says 'Bring 'em On' &#8211; Instead, let's bring them home;&quot; 
      &quot;Get That Unelected Warmonger Out of the White House;&quot; and &quot;Richard 
      Cheney &#8211; Get The Halliburton out of Iraq.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some protested the extended tours of duty in Iraq and cuts in veterans' 
      benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others cited continuing guerilla attacks on U.S. soldiers and the 
      failure to date to find weapons of mass destruction, calling the entire 
      rationale for the war into question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;We have recently found out the reasons weren't exactly truthful,&quot; said 
      Christyne Harris, who has a son-in-law in Iraq. &quot;I think the morale is 
      sinking.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bush administration officials have said evidence indicated that Saddam 
      Hussein continued to seek weapons programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions 
      imposed after the first Gulf War.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his prerecorded radio address, Mr. Bush said Iraq was on its way 
      to becoming a &quot;stable, self-governing society,&quot; and &quot;this progress makes 
      the remaining terrorists even more desperate and willing to lash out 
      against symbols of order and hope, like coalition forces and U.N. 
      personnel.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;A violent few will not determine the future of Iraq, and there will be 
      no return to the days of Saddam Hussein's torture chambers and mass 
      graves,&quot; Mr. Bush added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president also condemned last week's suicide bombing aboard a bus in 
      Jerusalem, saying Palestinian terrorists are undermining their people's 
      hopes for an independent state. He urged Palestinians and Israelis to 
      continue to work together toward peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;A Palestinian state will never be built on a foundation of violence,&quot; 
      Mr. Bush said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bush critics who journeyed to Crawford had various opinions about 
      the president and what course he should take in Iraq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some protesters, who endured a brief rain shower, accused Mr. Bush of 
      lying to justify the war, while others said he was only mistaken. Some 
      called for immediate withdrawal from Iraq, while others urged the 
      administration to seek U.N. help in stabilizing Iraq.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all said they wanted their loved ones back as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;We're not going to stop until we get our soldiers home,&quot; Ms. Robison 
      said. &quot;And it's going to get bigger and bigger.&quot;
