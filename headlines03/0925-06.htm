      Prominent US-Palestinian intellectual Edward Said, who has died. (AFP/MENA/HO) <br>

  </table></font>NEW YORK  - Palestinian intellectual <a href="http://www.edwardsaid.org/" target="_new">Edward Said</a>, a prolific author and literary critic who wanted Israelis and Palestinians to live in an integrated democratic nation, died on Thursday after battling leukemia. He was 67.

<p>"Over the past three decades he was the most eloquent spokesman for the plight of the Palestinians," said Hamid Dabashi, chairman of the Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures Department at Columbia University, where Said worked.

<p>Said died in a New York hospital, Dabashi said.

<p>A comparative literature professor at Columbia, Said was a literary critic and theoretician and a prominent Palestinian activist. Arab commentators said he would be remembered as a Palestinian patriot and a towering intellectual who broke ground in the theory of literature and Orientalist studies.

<p>While Israel and its supporters attribute the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Arabs' refusal to accept the Jewish state, Said portrayed the problem in terms of atrocities by that state against Palestinian victims.

<p>A longtime Palestinian National Council member, Said broke with Yasser Arafat, believing the 1993 Oslo peace accords were "a Palestinian Versailles" that further eroded Palestinian human and national rights. He opposed a segregated two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, proposing an integrated, democratic country instead.

<p>"I see no other way than to begin now to speak about sharing the land that has thrust us together, and sharing it in a truly democratic way, with equal rights for each citizen," Said wrote in The New York Times in 1999.

<p>Arafat said in a statement his people "mourn with grief and pain the international intellectual and son of the Palestinian people, Professor Edward Said."

<p>The Palestinian Authority representative in the United States, Hassan Abdel Rahman, told Reuters that Said's attacks on Arafat did "not in any shape or form take away from his place in Palestinian history and society."

<p>Said's books include "Orientalism," "A Question of Palestine" and "The End of the Peace Process." His theory of Orientalism said that false and romanticized images of the Middle East and Asia were used to justify Western colonialism and imperialism there.

<p>'SAVORED HIS WIT'

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan "always enjoyed his company, savored his wit, and admired the passion with which he pursued his vision of peace between Israelis and Palestinians," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.

<p>Friends recalled Said saying in recent months he was "not dead and not alive" as doctors increased his chemotherapy.

<p>"We lost a peak of Arab intellect," said Abdelwahab al-Badrakhan, deputy editor of the leading pan-Arab newspaper al-Hayat in London. "He articulated the basis for Palestinian patriotism and added to his fundamental rejection of Zionism the idea of Palestinian-Israeli coexistence."

<p>Abdullah Schleifer, head of the Adham Center for TV Journalism at the American University in Cairo, praised Said for denouncing suicide bombings but said he failed to highlight Arab suffering elsewhere in places like Iraq: "He was unable to see problems in other parts of the Arab world, such as the massacre of Kurds and Shias."

<p>In 2000, Said visited southern Lebanon and in keeping with custom, tossed "stones of celebration" across the border with Israel. When a photographer captured the moment, the widely published picture was used by opponents to paint Said as a rock-throwing militant.

<p>Said was born in Jerusalem, a Palestinian Christian, but spent most of his childhood in Cairo. Even that brought Said controversy when an Israeli scholar accused him in 1999 of falsifying his biography.

<p>Educated at Princeton University and Harvard University, he also taught at Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Yale University.
