 <p>They get honked at, cheered and flipped the bird.
<p>In snow, rain and blazing heat, they stand, unfazed, in silence.</p>
 <p> They are the <a href="http://www.womeninblack.net/" target="_new">Women in Black</a>, who gather three to 30 in number for their weekly street-corner vigil for peace.</p>
 <p> "It's a little thing that we can do to stand up against war and violence," said Vicki Rottman, a sculptor who has organized vigils every Thursday in Denver after hearing about a similar group protesting on Wednesdays in Boulder. "Sometimes silence speaks louder than words."</p>
 <p> The Women in Black movement started in Jerusalem in 1988. Seven Israeli women stood in silence on a busy intersection, hoping their presence would spur people to think about Israel's role in the occupied territories and about the Palestinian intifada rising up that year.</p>
 <p> Since then, dozens of similar groups have followed their lead, organizing regularly scheduled, silent vigils on street corners and in parks worldwide.</p>
<p> In Italy, women have protested violence by the Mafia. In Germany, they have stood up to neo-Nazism. In India, they have called for an end to the abuse of women by religious fundamentalists.</p>
 <p> Rottman formed the Denver group last November during the build-up to the war with Iraq. She choose to gather from 5:15 to 6:15 p.m. in front of Denver's Wellington E. Webb Municipal Building at the northwest corner of Colfax Avenue and 15th Street because of its central location, the heavy rush-hour traffic passing by and a small sculpture nearby reading, "May Peace Prevail in our Homes," "May Peace Prevail in our Communities" and "May Peace Prevail on Earth."</p>
 <p> Though major combat in Iraq officially is over, the group continues to gather.</p>
 <p> "Certainly there's still a need just to bring awareness to the fact that there is too much violence still in Iraq, and throughout the world. It isn't specifically about a single war, there's just ongoing violence," Rottman said.</p>
 <p> Nancy McGuire, a child-care provider from Denver, joins the Denver group each Thursday to protest the deaths of women and children in Iraq as well as child abuse and domestic violence worldwide.</p>
 <p> Kaaren Hardy, a retired historic preservationist from Westminster, said she likes the movement's quiet approach as a "way to voice our opinion, but not be confrontational."</p>
<p> The response from pedestrians and drivers is mixed.</p>
 <p> Last Thursday, one biker urged the group on, calling out, "Go, girls." Another man made the peace sign. Two others called them names.</p>
 <p> One man passed by recently and asked, "Well, are you Christians or liberals?"</p>
 <p> "As if those were the only choices," Hardy said.</p>
 <p> LeAnne Schamp, an administrative assistant from Denver, was particularly disturbed during the Iraq war when one driver yelled, "We should kill them all."</p>
 <p> "I never knew there were that many hand gestures," she added.</p>
 <p> Still, Schamp says she and her fellow women in black are making a difference.</p>
 <p> "People notice us. You can see them talking or looking quizzically in their cars," she said. "Maybe they're laughing at us. But I know we're getting them thinking."</p>
 <p> Steve Lowe, a passer-by last Thursday, said the vigil doesn't sway his support for the U.S. invasion and continued military presence in Iraq. Still, he said, he's glad to see the group expressing their views.</p>
 <p> "In Denver, people can be so apathetic. It's just nice to see someone taking a stand," he said.</p>
 <p> Conventioneer Clarence Simmons, in town from Kansas City, videotaped the vigil and lauded the women for their pacifism.</p>
 <p> "But I gotta tell you," he said, "if it's peace they're waiting for, they're going to be standing there for a long, long time."</p>
