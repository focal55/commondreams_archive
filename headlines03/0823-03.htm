<p>NEW YORK</strong> --
In the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade 
Center, the White House instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to give 
the public misleading information, telling New Yorkers it was safe to breathe 
when reliable information on air quality was not available.
<P>That finding is included in a report released Friday by the Office of the 
Inspector General of the EPA. It noted that some of the agency's news releases 
in the weeks after the attack were softened before being released to the 
public: Reassuring information was added, while cautionary information was 
deleted.
<P>"When the EPA made a September 18 announcement that the air was 'safe' to 
breathe, it did not have sufficient data and analyses to make such a blanket 
statement," the report says. "Furthermore, the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality influenced . . . the information that EPA communicated 
to the public through its early press releases when it convinced EPA to add 
reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones."

BUSH ADMINISTRATION: NYC AIR 'SAFE TO BREATHE'<br>

</table></font>On the morning of Sept. 12, according to the report, the office of then-EPA 
Administrator Christie Whitman issued a memo: "All statements to the media 
should be cleared through the NSC (National Security Council in the White 
House) before they are released." The 165-page report compares excerpts from 
EPA draft statements to the final versions, including these:
<P>The draft statement contained a warning from EPA scientists that homes and 
businesses near ground zero should be cleaned by professionals. Instead, the 
public was told to follow instructions from New York City officials.
<P>Another draft statement was deleted; it raised concerns about "sensitive 
populations" such as asthma patients, the elderly and people with underlying 
respiratory diseases.
<P><b>LEVELS OF ASBESTOS</b>
<P>A statement about discovery of asbestos at higher than safe levels in dust 
samples from lower Manhattan was changed to state that "samples confirm 
previous reports that ambient air quality meets OSHA (Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration) standards and consequently is not a cause for public 
concern."
<P>Language in an EPA draft stating that asbestos levels in some areas were 
three times higher than national standards was changed to "slightly above the 
1 percent trigger for defining asbestos material."
<P>This sentence was added to a Sept. 16 news release: "Our tests show that it 
is safe for New Yorkers to go back to work in New York's financial district." 
It replaced a statement that initial monitors failed to turn up dangerous 
samples.
<P>A warning on the importance of safely handling ground zero cleanup, due to 
lead and asbestos exposure, was changed to say that some contaminants had been 
noted downtown but "the general public should be very reassured by initial 
sampling."
<P>The report also notes examples when EPA officials claimed that conditions 
were safe when no scientific support was available.
<P>New York's leaders responded with dismay.
<P>Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, called for a Justice Department 
investigation. "That the White House instructed EPA officials to downplay the 
health impact of the World Trade Center contaminants due to 'competing 
considerations' at the expense of the health and lives of New York City 
residents is an abomination," he said in a news release.
<P>Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an interview it was "understandable 
that in the midst of a crisis the White House did not want the EPA to sound 
alarmist." But, he warned, "If the public loses faith that things are safe 
when the government says so, we'll have done more damage than a pointed 
statement the week after 9/11 would have."
<P>The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
<P><b>EPA CHIEF</b>
<P>Acting EPA Administrator Marianne Horinko, who sat in on EPA meetings with 
the White House during the attack's aftermath, said in an interview that the 
White House had played a coordinating role, assembling information from 
various federal agencies.
<P>"It was a role someone had to play," Horinko said. "There was a potential 
for a Tower of Babel, and we needed to speak with one voice."
<P>The National Security Council played the key role, filtering incoming data 
on ground zero air and water, Horinko said. "I think that the thinking was, 
these are experts in WMD (weapons of mass destruction), so they should have 
the coordinating role."
<P>The focus at EPA, she continued, was on gathering data and making it public 
as rapidly as possible.
<P>"Under unbelievably trying conditions, EPA did the best that it could," she 
said.
