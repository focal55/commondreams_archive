<p>U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich hit the ground running in Portland on Friday, stepping off the Downeaster train from New Hampshire ready to rally Mainers onto his budding Democratic presidential campaign. </P>

</table></font>At a rally in Post Office Park on Friday afternoon, the Ohio congressman threw his support behind <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0814-08.htm">Oakhurst Dairy in its legal fight against Monsanto Corp</a>. and announced plans to open a campaign office in Portland.</P>

<P>

 Kucinich said he appeals to Maine voters because he is a progressive who is "giving people real choices."</P>

<P>

 "Maine has a knowledgable and free-spirited approach to politics," he said. "People know when the real thing is being offered."</P>

<P>

 During an hour with assembled supporters, many displaying stickers, buttons and signs, Kucinich discussed his plans for creating a universal health care system, cutting the country's defense spending, and his frustration with the Bush administration's handling of the war in Iraq.</P>

<P>

 Kucinich is only the second of the eight Democratic presidential hopefuls to visit Maine. He was preceded by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who spoke in Portland in May. </P>

<P>

 Kucinich said the nation was developing a system of "health poverty," where rising health care costs drive the poor and unemployed away from receiving treatment they need. </P>

<P>

 He said he supports a single-payer universal health care system that would provide coverage for various procedures, such as alternative medicines, vision care and long-term health. Kucinich said the money Americans spend on health care annually is already enough to subsidize a universal health care system.</P>

<P>

  On Iraq, Kucinich said the United States needs to "get our men and women who are targets out of Iraq." He said the United States should turn the reins of rebuilding the country over to the United Nations for allocating oil and construction contracts. </P>

<P>

 He went on to blame the Bush administration for using the Sept. 11 attacks as a false motivation for war with Iraq. He said a "pall of fear has been dropping over this country by an administration that exploited the 9/11 attacks."</P>

</table></font>The congressman said fear was used to increase defense spending and push forward measures such as the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security. And, he said, the situation was further worsened by the war in Iraq.</P>

<P>

 "The bombing of Iraq did not make us more safe, it made us less safe," he said.</P>

<P>

 He said he would cut the Pentagon's budget by 15 percent and ask Congress to repeal the Patriot Act.</P>

<P>

 Kucinich also called on the United States to help establish peace in other nations by fostering an environment conducive to negotiation.</P>

<P>

 "Healing in this world requires us to look at mistakes America has made that have caused animosity against this country," he said.</P>

<P>

 Before getting on a plane back to Cleveland to attend Labor Day observances, Kucinich attended a fund-raiser at O'Natural's restaurant. Campaign organizers said they have already raised over $2 million in funds in 37 other states. They hope opening a campaign office in Portland will help stir grass-roots support as the 2004 election gets closer.</P>

<P>

 Fred Bloom of Mount Vernon attended the rally with his family. Holding his granddaughter, Maya, he talked with others in the crowd and called Kucinich "a true populist."</P>

<P>

 "I think this is the most important campaign since the campaign of (former U.S. Sen.) Eugene McCarthy," he said. "He is the conscience of the Democratic Party."</P>

<P>

 Bloom said the candidate's conviction and passion is something that is rarely seen in current politics and something that could draw disaffected voters to his campaign. He said Kucinich's ideology sets him apart and makes him the best candidate to defeat President Bush.</P>
