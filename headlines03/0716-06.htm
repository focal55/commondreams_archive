<p>WASHINGTON - The Council on American-Islamic Relations yesterday blamed the Bush administration for contributing to a 15 percent increase in incidents of anti-Muslim discrimination and harassment last year, saying government policies and regulations implemented since Sept. 11, 2001, are creating increasingly hostile conditions for Muslims living in the United States.
<P>

   Over the course of 2002, the group validated 602 complaints of discrimination, ranging from mosque vandalism and mass murder conspiracies to passenger profiling and unreasonable arrests.
<P>

   Twenty-three percent involved interactions with governmental agencies and another 23 percent were in the workplace.
<P>

   ''These new numbers are very disturbing to us. The main violator of Muslim rights cited in this report is our United States government,'' said Nihad Awad, the council's executive director.
<P>

   Among the government actions the report criticized were raids on Muslim homes and businesses, special registration requirements, requests for mosque membership lists,  and ''intimidating'' interviews with Iraqi immigrants by the FBI as part of Operation Liberty Shield. 
<P>

   A spokesman  for the FBI said that any raid of personal or professional facilities ''is done with the full authority of the law.'' 
<P>

   But council leaders blame laws passed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, especially the USA Patriot Act, passed by Congress and signed by President Bush in October 2001. 
<P>

   The Patriot Act expanded  government authority to use surveillance, wiretapping, and records access in cases of suspected terrorist activities.  
<P>

   The report said laws such as the Patriot Act and policies such as the fingerprinting of males entering the United States from largely Muslim-populated countries ''circumvent the Fourth Amendment's requirement of probable cause.''  
<P>

   The group said the government needs a better balance between civil rights protection and homeland security.
<P>

   ''We cannot sacrifice one for the other,'' Awad said. ''We have been let down by this administration, and civil rights continue to diminish.''
<P>

   Jorge Martinez, a spokesman  for the Department of Justice, called the claims ''baseless.''
<P>

   ''The Justice Department and this administration takes very seriously any 9/11-backlash crimes and all acts of discrimination,'' Martinez said. ''We are focused on measures that stay within the boundaries of the Constitution and would never do anything to trample or violate those rights.''
<P>

   Martinez added, ''Many of these claims [of governmental abuse] are from groups or individuals who thought the United States government was doing too much in terms of national security before 9/11.''
<P>

   Some Middle East specialists have criticized the council  for not doing enough to condemn terrorist groups.
<P>

   ''Every action of government is going to be defined as anti-Muslim and not antiterror, even when justified,'' said Steven Emerson, executive director of the Investigative Project, a Washington research group.
<P>

   Immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the council said, the number of reported anti-Muslim incidents involving airplane passenger profiling and ''unreasonable detention, search, and interrogation'' dramatically increased from 40 to 258 valid complaints. 
<P>

   But last year there was nearly a 50 percent decrease in both types of incidents, the council said. Still, other reported complaints prompted the creation of new categories such as housing, business, and child custody discrimination and Internet harassment. 
<P>

   Acts of physical violence also saw a slight increase, according to the council.
<P>

   The council's report ranked California first in number of discrimination complaints, with 11 percent. Florida ranked second.
<P>

   Massachusetts was listed 12th, with 3 percent of the total complaints filed.
