<p>American special forces have raided the Baghdad home of the Iraqi scientist, nicknamed "Dr Germ", who ran the country's secret biological laboratory. 
<p>Intensifying their search for the "smoking gun" to prove Saddam Hussein had banned weapons, about 40 marines burst into the home of the British-educated Rihad Taha, who was in charge of a laboratory which weaponized anthrax. 

<p>Troops left the building carrying boxes of documents and with three men with their hands up. There was no sign of Dr Taha, the wife of General Amer Mohammed Rashid, Iraq's former oil minister. 
<p>US troops and civilian scientists leading the hunt for banned weapons will pore over the documents for evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. But as one of Iraq's key scientists, Dr Taha is likely to have gone to great lengths not to leave any incriminating evidence at her house. 

<p>Dr Taha, who insisted earlier this year that Iraq's biological program. was purely defensive, was reported by US intelligence over the weekend to have fled across the border to Syria. 

<p>Sources told the Washington Times that Dr Taha, who was educated at the University of East Anglia in the early 1980s, left Iraq along with Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, nicknamed "Mrs Anthrax" for her role in Iraq's biological weapons program.
<p>The raid in Baghdad came as the US military attempted to lower expectations of an imminent breakthrough in the search for a "smoking gun" to justify the war against Iraq. Amid mounting criticism of the failure to find any banned weapons, US Brigadier-General Vincent Brooks said people should be patient. 

<p>"It is very much putting together pieces of a puzzle, one piece at a time, and when you see the shape of the one piece, you see how it may relate to the other pieces that are out there," he said at his daily briefing in Qatar. "It is deliberate work and we remain confident in our approach." 

<p>But in a sign of America's desperation, the Pentagon announced that it would offer a reward to any Iraqi who can provide information about banned weapons. 

<p>A Pentagon official told AP that the US would pay up to $200,000 for information on the whereabouts of leaders from Saddam Hussein's regime and its hidden weapons. The Americans are hoping that such a generous reward will tempt lower ranking officials to testify against scientists involved in Iraq's weapons program. or officials who may have concealed the program.
<p>But such a sum is unlikely to tempt Dr Taha to come forward. In the run-up to the war, she admitted producing biological agents, but insisted this was purely for defensive purposes and the material was never used in weapons. 
<p>"We did produce biological agents," she said in February. "We never had the intention to use it. We never wanted to cause harm and damage anybody." 

<p>Her remarks appeared to contradict an earlier Iraqi statement to UN weapons inspectors, in which it admitted filling five warheads with liquid anthrax.
