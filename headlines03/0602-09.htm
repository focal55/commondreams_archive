<p>EVIAN, FRANCE   - The power of the masses is pitted against the&#160; might of the rich as tens of thousands swamp the streets in Switzerland and&#160; France in unprecedented protests against the powerful G-8 and all that it&#160;has to offer.</p><p>In the process, many angry young men and women drawn from all over Europe&#160; have found a new icon: celebrated Indian writer Arundhati Roy - or so it&#160; seems.&#160;</p><p>

</font>For about three days now, Switzerland's border town of Lausanne and Geneva,&#160; around 60 km away, have been virtually run over by angry people who feel the&#160; industrialized West that controls the G-8 is to blame for much of the&#160; world's worsening economic plight.&#160;</p><p>Protests have also taken place in this scenic and otherwise quiet Alpine&#160; resort at the edge of Lake Geneva, which divides it from Switzerland. And&#160; it&#160; is clear from comments on the street that anger against G-8, and in&#160; particular against big brother US, runs very deep.&#160;</p><p>After an estimated 100,000 people besieged Geneva Sunday, as leaders of the&#160; G-8 and about a dozen Third World countries made their way to France, there&#160; was no doubting that globalization had become a bad word.&#160;</p><p>"There have never been such big protests in Geneva," Stephane Bussard, a&#160; journalist with the Swiss newspaper Le Temps said. "It was massive, it&#160; was quite an important turnout."&#160;</p><p>Remarked Jacques Nikonoff, president of the anti-globalization group&#160; Attack:&#160; "The G8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the&#160; planet. We have to get rid of it."&#160;</p><p>This is where Arundhati Roy, author of the Booker-winning <em>The God of Small&#160;Things</em>, comes in.&#160;</p><p>Arundhati,&#160;who passionately&#160;campaigns&#160;against big dams, nuclear weapons and corporate globalization, is a must-read for many protestors.&#160;</p><p>Her writings and comments figure prominently in websites sought out by&#160; anti-G8 campaigners. Her writings are ammunition that provides oxygen to&#160; those who battle what they say is militaristic, neo-liberal capitalism.&#160;</p><p>The angry marchers in Geneva, Lausanne and Evian have proved what ordinary&#160; people can do if they join hands - a theme that runs through almost all of&#160; Arundhati's writings.&#160;</p><p>On Sunday, much of Lausanne, on the shore of Lake Geneva, turned into a&#160; ghost town. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas as some 200 of the&#160; nearly 1,000 protestors tore down street signs, looted stores and pulled&#160; down phone booths in a display of anger bordering on anarchy.&#160;</p><p>Construction sites were pillaged for ammunition to set up barricades.&#160; Bonfires were lit on streets. For people here who do not know what&#160; lawlessness is, it was a shock.&#160;</p><p>"What we saw was genuine people's anger," explained Polly Jones of "Jubilee&#160; Debt Campaign", a writer-cum-activist from London who was part of&#160; Saturday's&#160; show of strength in Geneva.&#160;</p><p>Fearing an invasion, armored personnel carriers and military helicopters&#160; were called out at the Geneva airport. Fighter jets patrolled the skies,&#160; while Israeli-built naval speedboats cruised Lake Geneva. Here in Evian,&#160; roving teams of French gendarmes in dark glasses patrolled the streets.&#160;</p><p>Parts of Lausanne, where delegations attending the G8 summit and related&#160; meetings are staying, look like concentration camps, with the authorities&#160; sealing off VVIP zones using concertina wire. The situation has forced&#160; Switzerland to deploy some 6,000 troops - the biggest military deployment&#160; since World War II. Many soldiers could be seen flaunting their weapons.&#160;</p><p>Panicky shopkeepers simply shuttered their establishments, closing down, in&#160; some cases, entire neighborhoods catering to tourists.&#160;</p>
<p>Said a young man here who gave his name only as Alex: "The people are&#160; angry,&#160;genuinely angry. People are angry with G8, and with (US President) Bush. There is no doubt about that."</p>
