<p>With the clock ticking ever closer toward a possible war against Iraq, the 
gulf between the Bush administration and the public in Europe's most powerful 
nations continues to widen.
<P>Interviews conducted over the past few days in England, France and Germany 
show mounting anger and disgust with the administration's perceived 
determination to push the Iraq crisis to a military conclusion regardless of 
world opinion. Russians, meanwhile, seem largely indifferent to the unfolding 
drama.
<P>Criticism of President Bush and his inner circle for what Europeans 
consider an obsession with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein does not extend to 
the American people themselves, who are spoken of with some affection and are 
widely considered to be dupes of their own government.
<P>Deeply held pacifism is a thread that runs through the outpourings of 
ordinary Europeans, not surprising for a continent where two world wars began.
<P>"I don't believe you can work out anything through violence, whether with a 
child, an adult or a whole country," said Sally Graham, 48, a North London 
teacher.
<P>Henriette Haudrikje, 31, a Berlin fitness-club clerk, said Germany was 
"doing the right thing" by refusing to jump on the war bandwagon. "We are 
pacifists," she added. "Our grandparents had enough experience with war to 
know it is not a good thing."
<P>Anger about a perceived American desire for world hegemony is an even more 
common refrain.
<P>Amirouche Laidi, the deputy mayor of the Paris suburb of Suresnes and a 
member of President Jacques Chirac's center-right party, said: "The world's 
biggest power is acting in a very crude way. We see it in (its rejection of) 
the Kyoto accords, with its refusal to allow Americans to be judged in the 
International Criminal Court -- even as Americans talk about being the world's 
biggest democracy -- and with its refusal to allow African countries free 
supplies of generic AIDS drugs.
<P>"The Bush administration's position is totally schizophrenic. It says one 
thing and does the exact opposite."
<P>Sabine Volt, 35, a Berlin public relations representative and mother of two, said, "America is setting itself up as the protector of the world. I'm just 
not sure I need to be protected right now."
<P>President Bush and his closest aides come in for fierce personal criticism 
from some.
<P>Peter Lawrence, 60, a civil servant in Great Wilbraham, England, said: "I 
hope and am prepared to believe for the moment that (British Prime Minister 
Tony) Blair is sticking with Bush because he realizes those guys are dangerous 
. . . and that he can moderate them by being there.
<P>"Linking Iraq with Sept. 11 makes no sense to anyone, but that is what Bush 
is doing -- harnessing Americans' nationalistic fervor . . . to attack Iraq 
and make them feel good and vote for him next time, in spite of the recession."
<P>Patrick Wintour, chief political correspondent for The Guardian, reported 
on Friday that some British Cabinet members are furious with Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld for alienating European public opinion, and he quoted one 
minister as saying of Rumsfeld, "He frightens me."
<P>Paris news vendor Richard Halden called "totally infantile" Rumsfeld's 
recent labeling of France and Germany as "Old Europe," while Deputy Mayor 
Laidi scorned Bush, saying "he isn't called 'Mr. Oil President' for nothing; 
that's the real objective."
<P>The low esteem in which Bush is held by Germans is stunningly illustrated 
in a recent poll by the respected Forsa agency quoted in the liberal weekly 
Der Spiegel. It found 54 percent of Germans consider Bush a danger to the 
world. Thirty-eight percent said they believe he is more dangerous than 
Hussein.
<P>Attempts by Blair -- Bush's principal ally on Iraq -- to make a moral case 
for the war have come at a steep cost.
<P>Support for the ruling Labor Party has plummeted to its lowest level in a 
decade -- 35 percent, only one point ahead of the opposition Tories. A BBC 
poll released on Thursday showed 90 percent of Britons opposing a war without 
a second Security Council resolution and 45 percent saying there should be no 
war no matter what the United Nations decides.
<P>Dominique Chadwick, 47, a film producer in Cambridge, England, faulted not 
only the Bush administration for its "rather arrogant attitude in expecting 
everyone to go along with its ideas" but ordinary Americans for their "failure 
to understand the Iraq situation as well as they should."
<P>"They complain about 'Old Europe's' reaction, but I feel that we are much 
more aware and informed than they are," she added.
<P>"I think Americans are too into their own country. They don't have a global 
vision of things," said Chantal Janisson, 44, a press representative at a 
French publishing house who lived in the United States for 11 years and is 
married to an American.
<P>Western Europeans say they have spent much time trying to educate 
themselves about the Iraq crisis, reading background books, watching 
documentaries on television and discussing the issues earnestly with friends.
<P>This appears not to be the case in Russia, where the dire condition of the 
economy is a far bigger concern.
<P>"Does America attacking some country in the Persian Gulf have anything to 
do with me being able to put food on the table for my children?" asked Alyona 
Fedusova, a computer programmer at a Moscow job-recruiting agency.
<P>"I think not. Then why should I care about it? This is not my war."
<P>As millions of anti-war demonstrators massed on Saturday all around the 
world, just over 100 people showed up at a protest outside the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow.
<P>Russians' lack of concern for Iraq, a longtime ally of the Soviet Union, 
was evident in a poll last week by Moscow's Public Opinion Foundation, which 
found only 19 percent support for Baghdad. More than 60 percent of those 
surveyed said Russia should not get involved in the looming conflict.
<P>Anti-American sentiment swept over Russia four years ago, when thousands 
threw paint balls, eggs and even fired gunshots at the U.S. Embassy to protest 
the bombing of Serbia, another long-standing Russian ally and fellow Slav 
nation.
<P>But the events of Sept. 11 appear to have changed all that. Washington's 
assertions that Iraq is linked to Islamic extremist groups -- including in 
Russia's own breakaway republic of Chechnya -- were met with understanding in 
a nation scarred by several dramatic terrorist attacks.
<P>Pollster Alexander Oslon said: "Today Russia looks at the world through the 
prism of terrorist threats. Russians certainly feel closer to America than to 
Iraq."
<P>"We have a common experience: We are both victims of terrorist attacks," 
agreed Sergei Markov, director of the Moscow-based Institute for Political 
Studies.
<P>Amid the angst and outrage expressed by Western Europeans, there is also 
wistfulness over the growing distance from a longtime friend.
<P>Helen Zimmer, 82, who has been a Berliner her entire life and remembers 
seeing neighborhood women raped by Russian soldiers, said: "My memories of the 
Americans are all good. They were the ones who helped us when we needed it."
<P>Even if there has to be a war against Iraq, she said it is important not to 
isolate Americans -- "They are still our heroes. We can't abandon them."
<P>Ginette Line, a 62-year-old retiree in Paris, said of Americans, "We were 
happy to have their support in World War II. They helped us a lot. But we need 
to avoid this war."
<P>Some political analysts and commentators also worry that demonization of 
the all-powerful United States is a stance that their own countries will live 
to regret in the long term.
<P>An editorial in the conservative German newspaper Die Welt stressed that 
"one does not have to approve of every move of U.S. power politics to 
recognize that the ad hoc (anti-war) alliance of Germany, France, Russia and 
China is an adventure doomed to fail."
<P>It further lamented that "the wisdom of being allied with a distant world 
power is simply being ignored" by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government.
<P>Le Figaro, a leading conservative Paris daily, fretted in an editorial on 
Wednesday that "nobody will be spared" the ruinous legacy of an Iraq invasion.
<P>"Reticent allies like Germany and France . . . will feel the consequences 
on their fragile economies. (If the price of oil soars) . . . , neither 
country will escape a recession. The euro zone will tremble."
<P>At the end of the day, however, what hurts Europeans most is that 
Washington seems determined to simply ignore the opinions of the vast majority 
of citizens in the countries it calls its closest allies.
<P>Francois Heisbourg, head of the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic 
Research, described himself as "somebody who's lived in the United States and 
probably has as close a relationship with America as anybody in France."
<P>He opined: "For me to come to the conclusion that we simply have to stand 
up and not be counted alongside the U.S. -- that takes some doing. This 
administration has succeeded in doing that.
<P>"The loss of goodwill here is just phenomenal."</p>
