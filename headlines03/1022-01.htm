  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FROM: Donald Rumsfeld</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SUBJECT: Global War on Terrorism</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The questions I posed to combatant commanders this week were: Are we winning or losing the Global War on Terror? Is DoD changing fast enough to deal with the new 21st century security environment? Can a big institution change fast enough? Is the USG changing fast enough?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DoD has been organized, trained and equipped to fight big armies, navies and air forces. It is not possible to change DoD fast enough to successfully fight the global war on terror; an alternative might be to try to fashion a new institution, either within DoD or elsewhere &#8212; one that seamlessly focuses the capabilities of several departments and agencies on this key problem.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With respect to global terrorism, the record since Septermber 11th seems to be:</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are having mixed results with Al Qaida, although we have put considerable pressure on them &#8212; nonetheless, a great many remain at large.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USG has made reasonable progress in capturing or killing the top 55 Iraqis.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USG has made somewhat slower progress tracking down the Taliban &#8212; Omar, Hekmatyar, etc.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With respect to the Ansar Al-Islam, we are just getting started.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have we fashioned the right mix of rewards, amnesty, protection and confidence in the US?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does DoD need to think through new ways to organize, train, equip and focus to deal with the global war on terror?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are the changes we have and are making too modest and incremental? My impression is that we have not yet made truly bold moves, although we have have made many sensible, logical moves in the right direction, but are they enough?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, we lack metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror. Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does the US need to fashion a broad, integrated plan to stop the next generation of terrorists? The US is putting relatively little effort into a long-range plan, but we are putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop terrorists. The cost-benefit ratio is against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' costs of millions.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do we need a new organization?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do we stop those who are financing the radical madrassa schools?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is our current situation such that &quot;the harder we work, the behinder we get&quot;?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is pretty clear that the coalition can win in Afghanistan and Iraq in one way or another, but it will be a long, hard slog.</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does CIA need a new finding?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should we create a private foundation to entice radical madradssas to a more moderate course?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What else should we be considering?</font></p>
  <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please be prepared to discuss this at our meeting on Saturday or Monday.</font></p>

</table>WASHINGTON &#151; The United States has no yardstick for measuring progress in the war on terrorism, has not "yet made truly bold moves" in fighting al-Qaeda and other terror groups, and is in for a "long, hard slog" in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a memo that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld sent to top-ranking Defense officials last week.</div>
<p>Despite upbeat statements by the Bush administration, the memo to Rumsfeld's top staff reveals significant doubts about progress in the struggle against terrorists. Rumsfeld says that "it is not possible" to transform the Pentagon quickly enough to effectively fight the anti-terror war and that a "new institution" might be necessary to do that.</p>
<p>The memo, which diverges sharply from Rumsfeld's mostly positive public comments, offers one of the most candid and sobering assessments to date of how top administration officials view the 2-year-old war on terrorism. It suggests that significant work remains and raises a number of probing questions but few detailed proposals.</p>
<p>"Are we winning or losing the Global War on Terror?" Rumsfeld asks in the Oct. 16 memo, which goes on to cite "mixed results" against al-Qaeda, "reasonable progress" tracking down top Iraqis and "somewhat slower progress" in apprehending Taliban leaders. "Is our current situation such that 'the harder we work, the behinder we get'? " he wrote.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita declined to comment specifically on the memo, but he said Rumsfeld's style is to "ask penetrating questions" to provoke candid discussion. "He's trying to keep a sense of urgency alive."</p>
<p>Among Rumsfeld's observations in the two-page memo:</p>
<p>&#8226; The United States is "just getting started" in fighting the Iraq-based terror group Ansar Al-Islam.</p>
<p>&#8226; The war is hugely expensive. "The cost-benefit ratio is against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' cost of millions."</p>
<p>&#8226; Postwar stabilization efforts are very difficult. "It is pretty clear the coalition can win in Afghanistan and Iraq in one way or another, but it will be a long, hard slog."</p>
<p>The memo was sent to Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs; and Douglas Feith, undersecretary of Defense for policy. </p>
<p>Rumsfeld asks whether the Defense Department is moving fast enough to adapt to fighting terrorists and whether the United States should create a private foundation to entice radical Islamic schools to a "more moderate course." Rumsfeld says the schools, known as <i>madrassas</i>, may be churning out new terrorists faster than the United States can kill or capture them. </p>
<p>The memo is not a policy statement, but a tool for shaping internal discussion. It highlights a Rumsfeld trait that supporters say is one of his greatest strengths: a willingness to challenge subordinates to constantly reassess problems. The memo prods Rumsfeld's most senior advisers to think in new ways about the war on terrorism at a time when many are preoccupied with the 7-month-old war in Iraq.</p>
<p>In public, the Bush administration has been upbeat in describing the war on terrorism. Attorney General John Ashcroft has noted that two-thirds of al-Qaeda's leadership has been captured or killed.</p>
