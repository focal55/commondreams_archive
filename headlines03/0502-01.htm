<p>Israeli troops killed 14 Palestinians yesterday, including two boys aged 2 and 13, as the government promised a series of "confidence building measures" in reply to Wednesday's presentation of the road map to peace. 
<p>The measures will include the release of up to 60 Palestinian prisoners and the dismantling of up to 12 illegal outposts. The measures are expected to coincide with the visit of Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, to Israel next week.

<p>Yesterday's raid began at around 2am with tanks and undercover troops in cars entering Gaza City's Shijaiyah neighborhood, a Hamas stronghold. Their target was Yusuf Abu Hein, 31, a senior figure in Hamas.

<p>Israeli soldiers surrounded his apartment, which also contained two of his brothers, Ayman, 29, and Mahmoud, 38. The three exchanged fire with the soldiers until the Israelis blew the building up, killing all three men.

<p>More than 200 gunmen, many wearing black masks, rushed to the scene, as mosque loudspeakers called for a jihad, or holy war.

<p>Intense fighting continued into the afternoon. Israeli troops fired tank shells and heavy machine guns, and helicopters fired five missiles. Palestinians were armed with assault rifles and anti-tank missiles.

<p>Fadel Abu Hein, a child psychologist and a brother of the wanted man, said his four-story apartment building came under intense fire.

<p>"We are sitting in full darkness. Children are screaming. We are trying to calm them down, but bullets are coming from all directions," he said.

<p>A reporter from the Associated Press saw two boys, aged 12 and 14, hit by Israeli fire as they tried to run away from a burst of shooting. The 14-year-old was struck in the neck, and doctors later said he was paralyzed from the neck down.

<p>Among the other fatalities were five gunmen, two adult civilians, and two boys, aged two and 13, doctors said.

<p>Sixty-five Palestinians were wounded, including 15 who were in critical condition.

<p>Two-year-old Amer Ayad was hit by a bullet to the head while he was near a window in his home, said his father Ahmed, a blacksmith. "Is this the new peace President Bush promised?" he said. "They wrote the answer using the blood of my son."

<p>Eight Israeli soldiers were wounded, including one who was in serious condition. Earlier in the West Bank, two Palestinian gunmen were killed in a clash with Israeli soldiers near the village of Yatta.

<p>The raid followed the suicide attack on a Tel Aviv bar on Wednesday which killed three people. Hamas and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed responsibility but the bomber was later named as a Briton, Asif Mohammed Hanif. He was accompanied by another Briton, Omar Khan Sharif, whose bomb failed to detonate. Israeli security forces are still searching for Sharif.

<p>Despite the recent violence Israeli government officials said they planned to carry out confidence building measures in the coming week. An official said: "The prime minister and the defense minister are discussing the steps they will take. They are looking at releasing dozens of prisoners, maybe as many as 60, and dismantling between four and 12 illegal outposts.

<p>"Obviously they will be some of the less controversial outposts because we don't want to create internal problems."

<p>If there were more terrorist attacks, it might be impossible to carry out the measures, he added.

<p>A difference of opinion has already emerged on the road map to peace, which envisages a Palestinian state by 2005. The Palestinians insist that while they crack down on militants and prevent attacks on Israel, the road map calls for Israel to remove its military pressure on the Palestinians.

<p>Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian authority's minister for negotiations, said that the representatives of the quartet who wrote the road map, the US, UN, EU and Russia, had assured the Palestinian leadership that Israel and the PA's obligations should be met in parallel.

<p>"The quartet delegation made clear that Israel would not be allowed to avoid its road map obligations through the unilateral imposition of arbitrary conditions and unreasonable sequencing," said Mr Erekat.

<p>In Jerusalem, an official in the office of Ariel Sharon, the prime minister, said that Israel viewed the road map differently, insisting the Israelis would only act once the Palestinians had fulfilled their requirement to stop all violence and reform their government.

<p>"We continue to stress that the road map is a series of sequential steps as outlined in President Bush's speech of June 24 2002. We are still waiting to see if they take concrete and energetic steps to combat terrorism," he said.
