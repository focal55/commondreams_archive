<p>BAGHDAD - At least 12 Iraqis died on Saturday  when an arms dump exploded on the edge of Baghdad, sending  rockets scything into nearby houses. Residents blamed the  Americans for the carnage.
<P>
The U.S. military said unknown attackers fired an  incendiary device into an Iraqi munitions store, at Zaafaraniya  on the capital's southern outskirts, triggering a series of  blasts.<P>

</table></font>But local people turned their anger on the Americans,  shooting at soldiers trying to help relief efforts and forcing  them back from the scene for a while.<P>
Some soldiers were wounded, the Army said, but their  condition was not immediately known.<P>
Residents said U.S. troops had packed cars with confiscated  weapons and detonated them at the site. The Americans denied  this and said the location of the dump near a residential area  showed Saddam Hussein's disregard for civilians.<P>
Anti-American protests broke out later in the capital and  the incident seemed sure to fuel mounting opposition to a  continued U.S. military occupation of Iraq.<P>
It was unclear how many people were killed in the blasts in  Zaafaraniya, a mixed residential-industrial suburb.<P>
An Iraqi medic traveling in a civilian ambulance ferrying  casualties to hospital said the explosions had killed many  people. Asked how many, he replied: "Forty."<P>
One distraught man, Tamir Kalaal, said his wife, father,  brother and 11 other relatives had been killed when a rocket  shot out of the arms dump and destroyed their home.<P>
The main hospital in the district said at least 12 people  had been killed and 40 injured. U.S. Central Command in Qatar  said at least six had died.<P>
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld left for the Gulf on  Saturday to thank regional leaders for support in the war that  toppled Saddam and to discuss future U.S. military deployment  in the oil-rich area.<P>
U.S. officials did not say whether he would visit Iraq.<P>

</table></font>About 500 men, chanting anti-American, pro-Islamic slogans,  drove out of Zaafaraniya in a convoy of trucks, buses and cars.  One truck carried six coffins. Two banners in English read:  "Stop Explosions Near Civilians" and "The Terror After War."<P>
Later, scores of men gathered in a central Baghdad square  to protest at the U.S. military presence in Iraq, waving their  fists and chanting: "Yes, yes to Islam! Yes, yes to Iraq!"<P>
A Muslim cleric with a megaphone egged on the crowd. One  green banner read: "U.S. forces kill innocent with Saddam's  weapons in Zaafaraniya."<P>
The incident underlined how far Baghdad is from being  pacified 17 days after U.S. troops took the city.<P>
It came just hours after aides said President Bush would  declare an end to hostilities next week and hail the success of  U.S.-led combat operations.<P>
Saddam, his sons Uday and Qusay and many of his closest  aides are still missing and no weapons of mass destruction --  one of the reasons the United States and Britain gave for  launching the war on March 20 -- have been found.<P>
American interrogators were quizzing captured former deputy  prime minister Tareq Aziz and at least 11 other detainees from  a U.S. list of 55 most wanted Iraqis. They hope the captives  will help them find the fugitives and their alleged weapons  caches.<P>
In Madrid, meanwhile, more than 100 Iraqi opposition  figures gathered for a weekend of talks on future democracy in  Iraq.<P>
Members of the pro-U.S. Iraqi National Congress, the  Shi'ite Muslim party Al Dawa, the Iraqi Communist Party,  Kurdish parties and other groups were taking part.<P>
U.S. administrator in Iraq Jay Garner has said the process  of forming an Iraqi-run government will begin by next weekend.<P>
HOMES DESTROYED<P>
In Zaafaraniya, a group of women in black shawls stood  amidst the rubble of destroyed houses weeping uncontrollably.<P>
Hussein Hafez, a 57-year-old neighbor, said: "Saddam was a  butcher, and now this. This is a residential area. Why are the  Americans blowing up weapons near us?"<P>
The explosions at Zaafaraniya were so loud they were heard  in central Baghdad.<P>
U.S. troops in the city center told reporters initially  they were controlled detonations, but later the American  military spoke of an attack by "an unknown number of  individuals."<P>
"One soldier was wounded in the attack," the Central  Command statement said. "During the attack, the assailant fired  an unknown incendiary device into the cache, causing it to  catch fire and explode. The explosion caused the destruction of  the cache as well as a nearby building."<P>
Zaafaraniya residents said U.S. forces had been packing  cars with Iraqi weapons over the last three days and detonating  them.<P>
Kalaal, the man who lost 14 relatives when his house was  destroyed, had no doubt who was to blame for the tragedy.  "Those Americans did this," he said, shaking his finger in  rage.<P>
TROOPS STONED<P>
Apart from Saturday's protests in Baghdad, U.S. soldiers  and Reuters correspondents reported scattered anti-American  incidents in other cities.<P>
Groups of 250 to 300 teenagers hurled stones at Marines  patrolling the holy city of Najaf, south of the capital, in two  separate incidents on Thursday and Friday, officers said.<P>
There were no reports of injuries and the exact trigger for  the stone-throwing was unclear.<P>
Marines said their translators had told them that in one  case the crowd had mistaken them for British troops, against  whom they have grievances dating to colonial times in the first  half of the 20th century -- a sobering lesson for the Americans  about how long memories are in Iraq.<P>
In the northern city of Mosul, where soldiers have been  attracting swarms of curious people, at least 200 children and  a few adults crowded round some soldiers on foot patrol this  weekend and soon the stones came raining in.<P>
About a dozen of the older children were involved.  "They were throwing them like they were pitching a baseball,"  said Sgt. John McLean, who was hit on the helmet, in the back  and on the heel.
<P>
The troops took up a defensive position but the crowd only  dispersed when a warning shot was fired over their heads.
