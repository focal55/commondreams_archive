<p>WASHINGTON - On the 30th anniversary of a United States Supreme Court ruling that affirmed a woman's rights over her body, population and health groups here and abroad are mobilizing against what they say is a "secret war" by the administration of President George W. Bush  against women and their reproductive rights.

 

In an unusually strong statement issued Wednesday, the London-based <a href="http://www.ippf.org/" target="_new">International Planned Parenthood Federation</a> (IPPF) charged that Bush's ban three years ago on U.S. aid to overseas groups supporting abortion rights has actually increased the number of unwanted pregnancies around the world, resulting in thousands more illegal and unsafe, and potentially deadly, abortions.
<p>
 


"Shielded by the smokescreen of an imminent war [against Iraq], President George Bush is waging another stealth campaign, systematically working to undermine reproductive freedom around the world," said IPPF, which released a two-page, 40-item list of administration moves since 2001 to reduce the rights of women in the U.S. and other countries.
<p>
 


The IPPF statement follows similar declarations by other health and women's organizations over the past week. U.S. groups are also preparing a major lobbying effort in late March to persuade lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the administration's policies will prove costly to politicians who support them.
<p>
 


"The Bush administration is waging a war on the world's women by denying them access to a basic human right -- the ability to plan the size and spacing of their families," according to Population Connection, a Washington-based advocacy group which is helping to organize the lobbying campaign.
<p>
 


Besides the reinstatement of the aid ban, which had been repealed by former President Bill Clinton in 1993, Bush blocked a congressionally-approved US&#36;34 million contribution to the United Nations  Population Fund (UNFPA) last July on the grounds that the agency was providing assistance to China's health ministry which has indirectly supported coercive abortions in some counties.
<p>
 


Shortly afterwards, Bush reversed his previous support for U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women that requires all governments to guarantee that women will enjoy the same legal rights and access to healthcare as men.
<p>
 


In November, the administration announced it would withhold &#36;3 million to the World Health Organisation's reproductive-health program because of its research into RU-486, the  abortion pill.
<p>
 


In another controversial move, the U.S. delegation at a UN-sponsored conference on population in Bangkok last month tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to change the language of the landmark 1994 Cairo Declaration by deleting or amending all references to "reproductive health services" and "reproductive health" which it claimed advocated abortion.
<p>
 


Behind these moves, as well as others at international conferences--such as promoting abstinence; attempting to block endorsement of condom use to prevent AIDS, and opposing special efforts to help girls and women who are victims of rape in war--lies a determination, according to the administration's critics, to win favor with the U.S. anti-abortion movement, a key political constituency for the White House.
<p>
 


Indeed, the decision to cut contributions to UNFPA was reportedly made by the White House Domestic Policy Council rather than the administration's foreign-policy apparatus.
<p>
 


"The President and the Republican majority in Congress are undertaking a calculated and deliberate stealth campaign to dismantle reproductive rights for women in this country and around the world," Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York, declared this week.
<p>
 


"The majority of Americans who are pro-choice must wake up and join ranks before it's too late," Maloney warned, noting that the administration, which now enjoys a majority in both the House and Senate, was certain to try to push through its anti-choice agenda in the new Congress.
<p>
 


IPPF, the world's largest voluntary organization for reproductive health, said Bush had shown a "single-minded determination to strip women of reproductive rights and access to reproductive health services -- not just abortion, but even family planning and sex education."
<p>
 


The group had itself lost &#36;18 million in U.S. aid to support family planning services in developing countries as a result of the reinstatement of the aid ban, often called the "Global Gag Rule" because it deprives overseas groups of aid simply for speaking publicly in favor of easing abortion laws.
<p>
 


"These acts," said IPPF's director general Steven Sinding, referring to the list of actions against women's reproductive health, "are a testament to the Bush administration's war against women and his overall contempt for their fundamental civil and human rights."
