<p>BAGHDAD - </b>
							So Baghdad has been bombed again, but it seemed Friday that 
this is only a minor problem. People have got used to the 
bombardment one hears - if ever bombardment is something you 
can get used to.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baghdad Shopkeeper</b></font></div>
</td>

</table>After the bombing of Al-Sha'ab nobody believes in precision 
bombs any more. ”It is a matter of luck,” says a shopkeeper, who is 
still getting a daily supply of fresh tomatoes to sell. Most bombs are 
expected to be precision-delivered, the rest are a small chance. 
<p>
And that kind of small chance at least Baghdad has learnt to take 
in its stride. 
<p>
It is not these chances that worry people, it is the growing 
certainties that have spread new fear. As the British and U.S. 
troops close in around Baghdad, the fear is that they will close that 
circle, and stay there. 
<p>
”They are going to starve us,” says a shopper at the souk. ”The 
American soldier will never come and fight on the streets of 
Baghdad,” he says. ”They will just wait for all our food to finish, wait 
for our water to finish, they will wait for us to be finished.” 
<p>
Baghdad is preparing for siege. It is preparing for siege in a 
summer when temperatures can rise to 50 degrees Celsius, 
without electricity, without enough water, and with only the most 
basic food. Baghdad is learning to fear a future that will make the 
years of crippling sanctions seem like a picnic. 
<p>
Residents are beginning to fear whether humanitarian aid will ever 
get through. The aid that feeds the people would also feed Iraqi 
military resistance to the forces laying siege. 
<p>
There are fears also over the fate of the millions who live in the 
suburbs of Baghdad. No one knows their situation, and certainly 
not the journalists living in Palestine hotel or the Rashid hotel. 
”Let's face it, we are reporting from our hotels, and really from the 
basement of our hotels,” says a cameraman for a British channel. 
<p>
The intense bombing of Saddam Hussein's Palace of Peace and 
other government buildings on Friday of last week gave journalists 
a rare ringside view of the war. Since then all that Baghdad has 
seen is mostly smoke in the distance. 
<p>
Most journalists do not want to step out when there is fear of 
bombing. And few can wander far anyhow; the minders take care 
of that. Journalists reporting Baghdad are reporting really the Iraqi 
official briefings, and a stretch of downtown Baghdad around the 
Tigris. When Baghdad begins to suffer, not even the journalists in 
Baghdad will be there to tell the story. 
<p>
At the vegetable market they say the roads to Baghdad are open 
from the north. 
<p>
No one knows for how long. Reports are coming in now of U.S. 
troops landing in the north with tanks, clearly for an assault from 
the north. It matters little what Iraqi television says, or even that 
there is no cable to link you with Al Jazeeera.
<p>
The radio tells people more than television can. And somehow 
everyone always seems to know what Al Jazeera puts out. 
<p>
”They will try to divide the city against itself,” says an Iraqi at the 
souk speaking perfect English; he does not say who he is and 
what he does for a living. ”They will try to set the people against 
the government, they will try to separate Sunni from Shia. This city 
is going to become a hell, I tell you, and we can all see that.”
 
Nobody believes the military will surrender to the Americans. 
Nobody believes that men from the Ba'ath party in their tens of 
thousands will exchange their Kalashnikovs for submission to the 
Americans. 
<p>
The Palestine Hotel is a comfortable place for now. It would 
probably be among the last places in Baghdad to feel the worst of 
what Baghdad will suffer. But even here the hotel guests - 
journalists mostly - have been warned that once things get really 
bad, they will be on their own. 
<p>
After a brave week or so Baghdad is beginning to shut down. Most 
shops now remain closed. Few parents care to send their children 
to school, office buildings open, but workers spend their time 
talking about what is to come. 
<p>
There is still no panic, but there is a desperation now to the 
attempts people are making to store food and water. Over the last 
few days they have become more precious than dinars. 
<p>
This will be the hottest summer Baghdad has ever known.
