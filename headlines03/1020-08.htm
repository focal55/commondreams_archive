<p>AMMAN, Jordan  - The U.S.-led war on terror has  radicalized more Arabs angry both with the West and their  autocratic rulers who are bent on curbing their political  rights, a U.N.-commissioned study released Monday showed.<P>
The <a href="http://www.undp.org/rbas/ahdr/englishpresskit2003.html" target="_new">Arab Human Development Report 2003</a> said Arab countries  lagged other regions in dissemination of knowledge. Readership  of books was relatively limited, education dictated submission  rather than critical thought, the Arabic language was in  crisis.

  </table></font>The report, launched in Amman, blamed an absence of  "effective and peaceful channels for dealing with injustices"  for pushing radical political groups to seek change by  violence.<P>
Rima Khalaf Hunaidi, the top U.N. official behind the team  of Arab intellectuals who wrote the report, said anti-Arab  sentiment in the West after the September 11, 2001 attacks on  U.S. cities was a further factor radicalizing Arabs.<P>
The U.N. Assistant Secretary General and regional director  of UNDP's Regional Bureau for Arab states said educational  opportunities were further limited as an anti-Arab backlash  made young Arabs retreat from studying in the United States.<P>
Arab student numbers in the United States dropped between  1999 and 2002 by an average 30 percent, Hunaidi added.<P>
Arab disenchantment was deepened by autocratic rulers who  were given a "spurious justification for curbing freedoms on  the pretext of fighting terrorism" by Washington's war on  terror.<P>
The report, on Arabs by Arabs, cited wider censorship --  from restricting internet access to suppressing publication of  material deemed encouraging to "terrorism."<P>
Non-governmental groups suffered more legal and practical  constraints in 2003, while progress toward women's empowerment  regressed in some countries and slightly progressed in others.<P>
OUTDATED UNIVERSITIES<P>
The U.N. report that focused on addressing challenges of  modernity illustrated how far the 270 million Arabs lagged  behind other regions in 'acquisition of knowledge'.<P>
The report said even a best selling novel sold on average  only 5,000 copies compared to hundreds of thousands elsewhere.<P>
In general, the usual print run for novels ranges from a  meager 1,000 to 3,000 copies. The number of books published in  the Arab world did not exceed 1.1 percent of world production  though Arabs constitute 5 percent of the world population.<P>
It cited official educational curricula in Arab countries  that " bred submission, obedience, subordination and compliance  rather than free critical thinking."<P>
The U.N. also touched on the state of Arab universities,  decrying lack of autonomy and the direct control of governments  that ran them on political whims. Arab universities were  overcrowded with old laboratories and poor libraries. Enrolment  figures were a political gesture to appease society more than a  product of educational needs. The Arabic language was in  crisis, as it confronted the challenges of globalization. No  more than 10,000 books were translated into Arabic over the  entire millennium, equivalent to the number translated every  year into Spanish.<P>
Research and Development in the Arab world did not exceed  0.2 percent of Gross National Product (GNP). Fewer than one in  20 Arab university students were pursuing scientific  disciplines, compared to one in five in South Korea.<P>
The number of telephone lines in Arab countries was barely  one fifth of that in developed countries.<P>
Access to digital media was also among the lowest in the  world. There are 18 computers per 1,000 people compared to a  global average of 78. Only 1.6 percent of over 270 million  Arabs have internet access, one of the lowest ratios in the  world, the report said.<P>
