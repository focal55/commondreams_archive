<p>Portland veterans offered some of the most powerful testimony for and against a nonbinding resolution passed Monday night by the City Council to oppose a pre-emptive invasion of Iraq by U.S. military forces.</P>

<P>

Lou Bergeron, a disabled Korean War veteran, pleaded with councilors to support the resolution so that others might be spared the tragedies of war, including the soldiers who return with "broken bodies and broken minds."</P>

<P>

 Joe Libby, a Vietnam veteran whose brother John died in the war, urged councilors to oppose the resolution for the message it would send to his 25-year-old son, Todd, a Portland firefighter who has been called to active duty in the Army reserves.</P>
<P>

"You are telling them that you don't support them," Libby warned the council, which faced a chamber and balcony packed mostly with sign-holding peace activists.</P>

<P>

After two hours of testimony from residents ranging from students to doctors to retirees, the council voted 8-1 to pass the resolution. It was sponsored by councilors Karen Geraghty and Nathan Smith, and co-sponsored by Mayor James Cloutier and councilors Peter O'Donnell, John Griffin, Nicholas Mavodones and Jill Duson.</P>

<P>

Geraghty said the resolution wasn't a "categorical opposition to war" and that it wasn't intended to "disrespect anyone in a uniform."</P>

<P>

"I think standing up for peace is an honorable thing," said Geraghty, who wore a button, like many in the audience and on the council, that said, "Peace begins with us."</P>

<P>

The council joined nearly 50 cities across the country that have passed similar resolutions in recent weeks, including Boulder, Colo., Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia and Seattle.</P>

<P>

The Maine Legislature today is scheduled to take up a similar resolution, sponsored by Sen. Ethan Strimling, D-Portland. If it passes, Strimling said, Maine will be the first state in the nation to take such action. The Bar Harbor Town Council is set to consider a similar resolution today as well, one backed by more than a dozen local business owners.</P>

<P>

Councilor Cheryl Leeman cast the sole vote against the resolution, saying that she agreed with many of the ideas it contained but felt uncomfortable speaking for all Portland residents on matters of war and foreign policy. Some in the audience heckled her.</P>

<P>

"These folks organized," Leeman said of the crowd after the vote. "Based on the phone calls and e-mails I got, there are plenty of people out there who disagree with them. I don't think this council collectively can send a message to Washington that is reflective of the entire community." </P>

<P>

Councilor James Cohen initially questioned the appropriateness of the resolution but ultimately supported it, including amendments that called for the United States to act if there were "a clear showing of need" and voiced support for U.S. soldiers "whatever course of action our nation ultimately takes."</P>

<P>

The resolution also "expresses strong support for a genuinely multilateral diplomatic approach to resolving the current conflict between the governments of the United States and Iraq." It supports "achieving the valid objective of disarming Saddam Hussein through an effort sanctioned and directed by the United Nations."</P>

<P>

It acknowledges the "grievous loss of life" from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but it states that no public information has shown a link between the attacks and the government of Iraq. It states that a war with Iraq would jeopardize the lives of American soldiers and "innocent Iraqi civilians who have already suffered enormously under Saddam Hussein's rule and United Nations sanctions."</P>

<P>

 The resolution states that a war with Iraq would cost the United States more than $100 billion, of which $267 million would come from Maine taxpayers. It also states that Portland and Maine are in the midst of an economic crisis and that the money earmarked for war "could go a long way to meeting our health and education needs."</P>
