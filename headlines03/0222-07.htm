<p> BAGHDAD -- Is this the light before the dark? Each night this week, Iraq has glowed in the languid phosphorescence of a full moon. </p>
<p>But now it's waning and Iraqis are starting to brace, waiting for a United States strike that could come in the natural blackout that will envelop the region in the early moonless hours of  March 4.</p>
<p>Diplomatic wrangling at the United Nations suggests the second week in March as the most likely attack date. But US military planners, who see the battlefield through the eerie green of night-vision goggles and the matrix of their own logistics, will be urging the White House: "Go now - go in the dark, beat the heat."</p>
<p>This war will start much as the Gulf War did - but then it must shift gear quickly, within days, to become a very different contest. The difference will lie somewhere between the antiseptic video game of the last conflict and the <I> Black Hawk Down </I> brutality of a battle strategy that insists on allied boots on the ground. </p>
<p>The opening shots will be geared to isolating and confusing Saddam Hussein and his command structure - "decapitating the regime", as the Pentagon says. The targets will be communications and power plants, the military and its security bunkers.</p>
<p>But in 1991 the objective was merely to evict Saddam from Kuwait and most of the attacks were remote, from over the horizon and way up in the blue - cruise missiles that deftly tracked highways before turning right or left to slice through communications towers and power station smokestacks.</p>
<p>This time the US goes into battle with vastly more sophisticated technology - digital communications, microwave weapons and unmanned delivery systems.</p>
<p>But to take a sprawling city of about 5 million people that is nearly in the center of a huge desert, calls for an army of  tens of thousands to march in from the south, north and west.</p>
<p>Soldiers of  Australia, Britain and the United States - welcome to Baghdad.</p>
<p>The Iraqi capital will be hard to defend. But in war few cities of this size have been captured without a bruising battle and a body count for the invaders that challenges public opinion and political will at home.</p>
<p>Historically, the casualty rate in the capture of  major cities has been as high as 40 to 50 per cent. Even when the US plays urban-conflict war games, the death toll invariably is more than 10 per cent. </p>
<p>The center of  Baghdad is chock-full of  high-rise apartment towers that will allow the Iraqis to make shooting galleries of  the city's jumbled avenues and lanes. And the locals know where best to hide along these potential furrows of death.</p>
<p>Likely targets are sprinkled throughout Baghdad's cinder-block sprawl - dangerous territory into which a desperate Saddam may attempt to lure pockets of an invading army before cutting them off from the rest of  the invasion force, or subjecting them to chemical or biological attacks - if he does have such weapons. </p>
<p>-Militarily, the city could be as daunting as Tora Bora, with the straight lines of urban design replacing the jagged rawness of  the mountains, and Saddam's network of bunkers and tunnels in the place of  the caves and tracks that provided an escape route for Osama bin Laden and hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters.</p>
<p>It all makes for good ambush terrain - there could be snipers in every building and an Iraqi runner with the nerve to nip across the street with a message becomes as effective as the Americans' state-of-the-art communications. </p>
<p>The US is preparing a list of civilian facilities that must be protected from the thousands of missiles it is priming. But there will be mistakes - in the Balkan wars the US did not mean to attack the Chinese embassy in Belgrade; and in the last Gulf crisis, shabby intelligence led to the death of more than 400 Iraqi civilians when the US bombed a shelter in Baghdad.  </p>
<p>If  the allies decide simply to smash into Baghdad, they risk alienating the population they desperately hope will welcome them as liberators. And if they kill a lot of  locals or lay siege to the capital, they are likely to come under huge international pressure to change tactics.</p>
<p>There is little obvious military preparation in Baghdad. This week, major earthworks could be seen in suburban bush, including construction of what appeared to be berms, behind which emergency fuel tanks and generators had been placed.</p>
<p>But missile launchers and air defense units are in place around the city and during a helicopter flight late last year the <I>Herald </I>observed the construction and provisioning of  numerous military dumps on the outskirts of  the capital.</p>
<p>Iraq has also placed missile launchers in its western desert, within striking distance of  Israel, and on its southern border, within range of targets in Kuwait and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But showing that he has learnt the lesson of  1991 - when more than 25,000 of  his men died compared with the loss of about 200 US fighters, and 65,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner - Saddam has not moved big troop numbers to his borders.</p>
<p>Instead, he has made it clear that he wants a showdown in the capital. With all the hyperbole of Middle Eastern rhetoric, he hectored Washington this week: "The people of Baghdad have resolved to force the Mongols of this age to commit suicide on its walls. Everyone who tries to climb over ... will fail in his attempt."</p>
<p>The people of  Baghdad are mostly expected to hunker behind closed doors, praying that the fighting will take place somewhere else as they forget their civil defense drills.</p>
<p>And Saddam will lose.</p>
<p>  But despite the confidence of  Mr Bush and his Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and the apparent chaos in reports this week that Saddam had put the head of  his military under house arrest, victory for the allies will come at a price that will be measured in blood.</p>
<p>Despite Washington's technical superiority, its own manual covering battles such as the fight for Baghdad makes disquieting reading.</p>
<p><I>The Doctrine for Joint Urban Operations </I>warns: "Cities reduce the advantages of the technologically superior force. The physical terrain of cities tends to reduce line of sight, inhibits command, control and communications capability [and] makes aviation operations more difficult ... It also degrades logistics, and often reduces ground operations to the level of small-unit combat."</p>
<p>The US claims that Saddam has dispersed the 70,000-strong Republican Guard, with which he intends to defend the capital, and that some time ago he secreted much of  his military machinery across the city.</p>
<p> These moves are being read as an attempt to spare the guard from early bombing, and then to race them into place before any allied troops arrive on the city's doorstep. </p>
<p>US intelligence says Saddam's defense is a circle within a circle - the first on the fringe of greater Baghdad, the second about 80 kilometers out.</p>
<p>He has nearly 500,000 men in uniform, an estimated 2200 main battle tanks, 3700 other armored vehicles and 2400 major artillery weapons - enough to disrupt the plans of any invading army.</p>
<p>Noting that in 1991 the US overestimated Iraqi might, John Arquilla, a professor of  defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, warns that this time the US may be underestimating it.</p>
<p>He told reporters: "The Iraqis have had a long time to prepare for the kind of campaign they believe we'll wage. [They] will use their cities for cover and resort to chemical and biological weapons if they have any."  </p>
<p>In the same vein, an analysis by George Friedman, co-author of <I>The Future of War, </I>cautions: "The elite of the Republican Guard are competent and motivated. They have benefited from Hussein's regime, and his defeat would cost them personally. They have reason to fight and some sense that it is not hopeless.</p>
<p>"They may not have satellites in space but they are well armed with the basic weapons of urban warfare: rifles, machine-guns, hand grenades, anti-tank weapons and, most important, familiarity with the battlefield.</p>
<p>"In a war of attrition, Saddam's troops merely have to put up a competent fight and, in a worst-case scenario, there could be thousands of American casualties." </p>
<p>So the challenge for the US - to minimize the street-to-street or house-to-house contest - becomes a double-edged sword. Can it break the Iraqi will to fight without a first-up, brutal strike? And if it does not opt for the brutal strike, how does it take Baghdad?</p>
<p>Historically, the US is used to destroying or going around cities. Now they need to isolate all or significant parts of  Baghdad in a manner that will break the grip of  Saddam's regime before Iraqi nationalism and anger at the extent of  war damage stoke the fires of popular defiance.</p>
<p>At all times, Washington will have to juggle the hopes and wishes of  its different constituencies - the US voters and families back home, the Middle East and the world at large.</p>
<p>Clearly, Saddam's best option is a slow and deadly war. </p>
<p> Vice-Admiral Lowell Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned Congress this week that to achieve this, Saddam was likely to adopt a "scorched earth" strategy - destroying food, transport, energy and other infrastructure in the hope of creating a humanitarian disaster that he would blame on the Americans even as it slowed their advance.</p>
<p> Leaflets will rain down with the US bombs, telling civilians that the US and its allies are their friends and pleading with Iraqi soldiers to surrender.</p>
<p>The risks are huge - General Anthony Zinni, a former head of  the US Central Command, says: "I wouldn't get sucked into the cities. There would be a lot of casualties on our side, we'd kill a lot of civilians and destroy a lot of infrastructure, and the images on Al Jazeera [television] wouldn't help us at all." </p>
<p>One of the cockier supporters of  great US expectations is a retired army general, Barry McCaffrey,  who was in charge of the 24th Mechanized Division in the 1991 war.</p>
<p> He predicts: "If we decide to employ force, in 21 days it'll be all over. They're not going to believe what we do to them." </p>
<p>Harping back to the US losses in Mogadishu, Somalia, he said: "This ain't one Ranger company and 100 Delta Force guys. </p>
<p>"This would be the 3rd Infantry Division/Mechanized They're going to drive M1A2 tanks down the street with a 120mm gun and fire five rounds into a lower floor and bring the building down."  </p>
<p>That's a difference of opinion. Time will tell.</p>
