<p>U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige said Wednesday that he will not resign his post despite a growing furor about an interview in which he praised Christian values over public schooling.

</table>In a hastily organized news conference, Paige attempted to clarify remarks he made Monday to the Baptist Press, the national news service of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
<p>The news conference was intended to stem growing criticism by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anti-Defamation League, Muslim groups, church-state groups and Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez, who has helped shape national education policy. 
<p>"I understand completely and respect the separation of church and state," Paige said during the news conference. "I've spent years as a fiery advocate of public education, (and) I understand it to be one of the most powerful social systems in shaping the U.S.A." 

<p>In the Baptist Press interview, Paige encouraged pastors to be "the gatekeepers of the educational process" and said, "All things equal, I would prefer to have a child in a school that has a strong appreciation for the values of the Christian community." 

<p>Christian schools and universities have a "strong value system," Paige went on, saying, "that's not the case in a public school where there are so many different kids with different kinds of values." 

<p>Almost immediately, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State called for Paige's resignation, saying the secretary had "demeaned religious minorities" by appearing to criticize youngsters of different backgrounds. 

<p>"Religious pluralism strengthens our nation. It doesn't weaken it," said the Rev. Barry Lynn, the group's executive director. "If Dr. Paige does not understand this, he should resign." 

<p>In his clarification, Paige did not apologize for his remarks or say he had been misquoted. What he had meant to convey, he said, was that "the more specific the value system in a school, the better (chance) the school has of meeting (its) goals." 

<p>As for his statement that he would prefer to have a child in a school with Christian values, Paige explained that he and the interviewer "were speaking about higher education. Nowhere was there any reference to the public schools." 

<p>The interviewer, Todd Starnes, could not be reached for comment. 
<p>Despite Paige's response, "we still look at the original comments," said Jonathan Bernstein of the Anti-Defamation League, which sent Paige a letter Wednesday noting that "we do not share your view that public schools should be teaching children to have 'a strong faith' or values 'of the Christian community.' " 
<p>"We're holding him to a higher standard because, after all, he's secretary of education, not secretary of the Navy," Bernstein said. 

<p>Ameena Jandali, a board member with the Islamic Networks Group of San Jose, called Paige's remarks "a very strange message for a public educator, especially right now when our public school system is besieged by a lack of funds for basic programs. 

<p>"The secretary of education should not be endorsing Christian or private education over public education." 

<p>Miller told Paige on Wednesday that his remarks "are extremely troubling." 

<p>In the article, Starnes had written that "as chief spokesman for President Bush's education policy, Paige shares his boss' penchant for peppering speeches with religious overtones." 

<p>It is that penchant, and the policies that result from it, that appeared more troubling than this week's remarks to Terry Schroeder, a legislative analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union. 
<p>Schroeder said the ACLU takes issue with guidelines on prayer in school that Paige recently sent out to schools across the country. In those guidelines, Paige noted that student-initiated prayer is legal at graduation and other school events. 
<p>The ACLU disagrees. 

<p>"In fact," Schroeder said, "the Supreme Court struck down 'student- initiated' prayers before football games in 2002, and two lower federal courts have done the same. Only one federal appeals court has upheld such prayers." 

<p>She and other critics said the clash between church and state did not end with Paige's clarification. It may be just beginning.</p>
