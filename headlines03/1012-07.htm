<p>Terry Gydesen seems like the perfect photographer to have captured Paul Wellstone.</p>

      Remembering Paul and Sheila Wellstone</A>

  </table></font>As Gydesen puts it, she was "transcending" from a career in retail and still enrolled in photography classes when she began documenting political campaigns. In 1990, all she really knew about Wellstone, himself an outsider at the time, was that the people who volunteered for him had invested their spirits in him.</p>
<p>"Here was this passionate guy with this passionate staff," Gydesen recalls. "At first, I didn't even care if he won. I just wanted to be around these people."</p>
<p>With her instincts drawn to irony and her lens trained on emotion, Gydesen became the unofficial photographer for Wellstone's 1990 and 1996 Senate campaigns. After Wellstone's plane went down nearly a year ago, Gydesen's camera was allowed closer than anyone else's to the blur of grief and politics that marked the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Dozens of photographs spanning Wellstone's political life and immediate afterlife encompass "<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816644284/commondreams-20" target="_new">Twelve Years and Thirteen Days: Remembering Paul and Sheila Wellstone</A>." The book of black-and-white photographs, produced by the University of Minnesota Press, documents not only the conviction and fire fueling Wellstone's work but also that of the people supporting him from the grassroots.</p>
<p>Gydesen shot rallies, town hall meetings, press conferences, one-on-ones, quiet moments, rides aboard Wellstone's green bus of hope and, after the plane crash, the confusion, remembrance and auto-pilot hustle that surrounded Wellstone's campaign headquarters.</p>
<p>"I do get caught up in it, and that's why I'm not a photojournalist &#151; I'm not neutral," says Gydesen, 48, who has always lived in Minneapolis. "I was hooked right away. These were my people."</p>
<p><b>ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL</b></p>
<p>Gydesen spent her first days in documentary photography with Jesse Jackson, in 1988, and four years later followed the people propelling the candidacies of Jerry Brown and Pat Buchanan.</p>
<p>"Complete opposites in terms of politics, but the intensity for the candidate was the same," she says of Brown and Buchanan. "With Buchanan, I could let my cynicism run wild and not feel guilty."</p>
<p>Gydesen also photographed moments along the campaigns of Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. One of her favorite photos is of George Bush Sr., from a vantage that makes him look small and alone, his eyes peeking above a lectern.</p>
<p>Only Jackson's campaign hired her as an official photographer, when Gydesen came face to face with what she calls the "slimy business" of politics. Jackson's camp didn't use any of her photos, but some of Jackson's people went to work for Wellstone and gave Gydesen access as an independent photographer.</p>
<p>Photos in her book embody both public perceptions of Wellstone and more layered views best appreciated by those closest to him. Gydesen points to a photo she shot in 1996 at Minneapolis' Gay Pride Festival. A woman grasps Wellstone's right hand, a man tugs at his left, and Wellstone's expression, in Gydesen's mind, symbolizes the mixed emotions and public's reactions to Wellstone's recent support of the Defense of Marriage Act.</p>
<p>"I follow certain things on instincts, shoot on instincts," she says of her approach. "I don't think about it much. It's an emotional thing for me."</p>
<p>Jeff Blodgett, Wellstone's longtime campaign manager who contributes an essay to the book, sees Gydesen's photos as mementos and mile-markers. He cites photos from the 1996 election night as personal favorites.</p>
<p>"They really seem to capture Paul Wellstone's intense love of humanity, his love of people and connecting to people and the energy he poured into people," Blodgett says. "She really captured the spirit behind the campaign and organizing."</p>
<p><b>BACK FROM BURNOUT</b></p>
<p>Gydesen, whose primary income comes as the owner-landlord of her fourplex, felt burned out on politics after missing Jesse Ventura's campaign and failing to land a grant to do work in 2000. She immersed herself in another documentary project, focused on a community of winter "snowbirds" in a motor home community in Arizona.</p>
<p>But after hearing the Wellstones' daughter, Marcia Wellstone Markuson, speak during the 2002 Senate race, Gydesen wanted back in. She was on her way to Wellstone headquarters last Oct. 25 to pick up his campaign schedule when she heard news of the crash.</p>
<p>Out on the street in front of Wellstone's offices, Gydesen encountered a hive of distress. A woman close to the campaign spotted Gydesen in the throng of people placing memorials on the wall, hugged her and told her, "You've got to document this."</p>
<p>"My first thought &#151; I don't know how to do this," she recalls. "I'm crying, they're crying. Everybody's a mess."</p>
<p>Gydesen shot photos at the candlelight vigil at the capitol and got permission the next day to shoot inside campaign headquarters.</p>
<p>"It was hard to focus a lot of the time because my eyes were so teary," she says.</p>
<p>Blodgett credits these photos for helping him see Wellstone's death from a broader public context.</p>
<p>"They're very painful for me to look at, but the most touching and extraordinary photograph is the one that shows (Wellstone sons) Mark and David Wellstone with their arms around each other, speaking on Election Day," he says. "It shows the love and support people have for them and also their love for each other, and the fact there's just the two of them left standing."</p>
<p>Gydesen has fallen in step with others inspired by Wellstone to carry on his work and legacy. She recently won a grant from the McKnight Foundation that will allow her to document upcoming re-election campaigns of Minnesota state senators Mee Moua and Scott Dibble, who were among Wellstone's favorites in Minnesota politics.</p>
<p>"I read his book ("Conscience of a Liberal"), and something smacked me right between the eyes," she says, pointing to a passage reading: "The future will not belong to those who are cynical or those who stand on the sidelines. The future will belong to those who have passion and are willing to work hard to make our country better."</p>
<p>"It was devastating, first losing Paul and Sheila and then losing the election," she says. "But I have to stay out of the cynicism and remember Paul's words."</p>
