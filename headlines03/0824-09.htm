<p>WASHINGTON  - As the 2004 election nears,  President Bush could face an international "perfect storm" --  more attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, an overextended  deployment of U.S. troops eager to come home and blackening  clouds over the Middle East, North Korea and Iran.<P>

  </table></font>The confluence of world events will test Bush's foreign  policy leadership even as he must concentrate on the U.S.  economy and other domestic issues that could determine whether  he wins a second term.<P>
Although most Americans still have a favorable opinion of  the president, his job performance rating has slipped to 52  percent positive and 48 percent negative in a recent poll of  1,011 likely U.S. voters by Zogby International. This compares  with a post-Sept. 11, 2001, peak rating of 82 percent positive.<P>
The president and his top aides have repeatedly insisted  that their course in Iraq is the right one.<P>
But last week's bombing of the U.N. headquarters in  Baghdad, which killed 24 people, has provoked demands for a  reassessment of U.S. Iraq policy.<P>
Meanwhile:<P>
-- Renewed Israeli-Palestinian violence may have scuttled a  U.S. peace plan for the region.<P>
-- Six-party talks in Beijing this week raise both peril  and promise in dealing with the North Korean nuclear crisis.<P>
-- A U.S. push to have the United Nations address concerns  about Iran's nuclear ambitions could provoke a crisis.<P>
STORM BREWING<P>
"A perfect storm (on security) is brewing for the rest of  the year," said one military planner, referring to a  catastrophic clash of three storms that menaced the U.S.  Northeastern coast in 1991.<P>
In Iraq, a major lightning rod is the issue of troops --  whether the 139,000 U.S. military on the ground should be  supplemented with more Americans or foreign forces.<P>
In a letter to Bush last week, Democrat Joe Biden and  Republican Chuck Hagel, members of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, said the Baghdad attack showed the "urgent need" for  more foreign forces in Iraq.<P>
They urged Bush to find a way to broaden the U.N.'s role,  so leaders of countries that opposed the war can have the  "political cover" to justify post-war cooperation.<P>
"It is worth enhancing the role of the United Nations  because it will allow us to share the huge risk and expense of  securing, policing, and reconstructing Iraq -- tasks that will  take tens of thousands of troops and tens of billions of  dollars over many years," the senators wrote.<P>
More compelling to the White House, perhaps, may be the  stance of William Kristol and Robert Kagan, neo-conservatives  who helped create the intellectual climate that propelled  Bush's decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein.<P>
In The Weekly Standard, which Kristol edits, they warned  that the future of U.S. world leadership and security is at  stake in Iraq but Bush has "failed to commit resources to the  rebuilding of Iraq commensurate with these very high stakes."<P>
TOO FEW TROOPS<P>
There are too few U.S. troops and too little money  committed to Iraq and another $60 billion and two army  divisions are needed, they said.<P>
"This is the time to bite the bullet and pay the price.  Next spring, if disaster looms, it will be harder. And it may  be too late," they wrote.<P>
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has insisted that no more  troops are required, just that the United States must hasten  preparations for Iraqis to take over security duties.<P>
Nevertheless, Washington has revived discussions with the  United Nations on a resolution to encourage countries like  France, Turkey, Germany and India to send troops and resources.<P>
Military planners say if the U.N. did pass a resolution  that France and others approved, it could take eight weeks for  troops from those countries to arrive on the ground in Iraq.<P>
That would bring them to Iraq's one working port and  airport about the time thousands of U.S. forces are due to  rotate out.<P>
But as the administration remains adamantly opposed to  sharing power in Iraq with the United Nations, agreement may be  impossible, or at least a long time in coming.<P>
Over time, if security in Iraq does not improve, the  original occupation force may have to return for another tour  of duty, said Phillip Gordon of the Brookings Institution.<P>
That could mean thousands of disgruntled military and their  families in an election year, experts say.
