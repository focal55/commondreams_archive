<p>FALLUJA, Iraq — Specialist Eric Martin sits on his bunk staring at the floor, his face a picture of despair.

<p>Earlier this week he and fellow soldiers in the Army's Third Infantry Division learned that their tour of duty in Iraq had been extended indefinitely.

<p>For the division, which engaged in some of the war's heaviest fighting when its tanks rolled into Baghdad in April, the news was almost too bitter to believe. Originally scheduled to be home by early June, they have been in the Persian Gulf region continuously since November and have had their return deferred three times.

<p>They are tired of patrolling hostile Iraqi towns in the punishing heat. They are tired of fighting an invisible enemy, knowing that a rocket-propelled grenade or mortar attack could come at any moment. Many are skeptical about the peacekeeping work they have been asked to do.

<p>"When I found out, I just went outside and broke down," Specialist Martin said.

<p>[One of them was killed on Friday, when a bomb exploded on the main Falluja bridge over the Euphrates, American military spokesmen said.]

<p>Specialist Martin has postponed his wedding, which had been scheduled for mid-September and in part paid for.

<p>His fiancée, Kimberly Simpson, said from Milledgeville, Ga., "I'm disappointed, but at the same time, that is his job."

<p>For the 7,000 other Third Division soldiers based in and around this town 35 miles west of the capital, the news was almost equally bitter. Many are openly angry at the Army and the Pentagon, whom they accuse of dishonesty about the length of their stay or the nature of their mission.

<p>It is not just the length of the stay that hurts, several soldiers and officers said. Some other divisions have been in the Middle East almost as long as this division, which arrived in Kuwait on Nov. 26. In World War II the division was deployed for 563 days, as the senior officers here often remind their subordinates. Many are now resigned to the likelihood that they will stay here for a year or more.

<p>What angers the soldiers here is that they were never prepared for such a long tour of duty, and were repeatedly told they were on their way home.

<p>Adding to the frustration, several officers said, is that much of their equipment is in poor condition and that they are short on ammunition and food.

<p>"We feel betrayed," Sgt. Jeffrey Lujan said as he sat on his bunk in the middle of the afternoon, watching other soldiers play poker or Ping-Pong in the abandoned warehouse that houses the headquarters of the division's Second Brigade. "It was like a big, big slap in the face when we found out we were staying."

<p>Last week relatives of soldiers in the division began circulating an e-mail message complaining about conditions in Falluja, along with a letter from an unidentified soldier. "Our morale is not high or even low," the letter says. "Our morale is nonexistent."

<p>Virtually all of the soldiers here have stories about the damage their extended stay has inflicted on them.

<p>"We've got guys whose wives are leaving them, and children who are sick," said Staff Sgt. Charles Wooten, who had to cancel his own wedding plans because of his extended stay here.

<p>Others have had financial and legal problems, like a soldier sued for child support, who says he has the receipts to show his payments but is unable to show up in court with the proof.

<p>First Lt. Monica Casmaer, a medic at the warehouse, said 15 or 20 soldiers came in with complaints about depression or stress in the morning. Some, she said, have become clinically depressed.

<p>For some the crux of the matter is the Army's failure to prepare them adequately for the relief work that now occupies much of their time. The Second Brigade was sent to Falluja in early June after a number of attacks in the area. The brigade began doing intensive patrols, said Capt. Edward Ballanco, who commands a tank company, and before long the attacks began to dwindle.

<p>The brigade is now helping to rebuild local schools and hospitals, and offering free medical care to Falluja and the surrounding towns.

<p>Some soldiers say the work is rewarding, a chance to help rebuild this shattered country.

<p>But many others have found the shift in roles baffling. The brigade's commanding officers have sternly warned their soldiers to be cautious about drawing their weapons in encounters with local residents, and several soldiers said they felt less safe as a result.

<p>"We were told to come in and take Baghdad and kill," Sergeant Lujan said. "Now they want us to turn off the switch and go into peacekeeping. It's very hard."

<p>Adding to the strain, several soldiers said, is the fact that there simply is not enough to occupy them here. They cannot venture beyond the gates of their outposts, for fear of being shot. So they sit on their bunks, listening to CD's, cracking jokes, trying not to think about when they will go home.

<p>Recently a group of soldiers began renovating a dilapidated brick building that was built by the British Army in the 1920's. The project is largely an effort to distract the men, Captain Ballanco said, but it has allowed them to employ some Iraqis to do painting and masonry work.

<p>"Hopefully we won't end up living in it," the captain said.
