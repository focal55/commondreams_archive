<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - Kathy Boudin, the '60s radical who has served 22 years in prison for a 1981 armored-car robbery in which three men were killed, was granted parole yesterday.

<p>Boudin, 60, a onetime member of the Weather Underground described as a model inmate in prison, had been denied parole just three months ago, as well as two years ago. Officials did not immediately explain the decision to grant parole.

<p>"Right now, she's hysterically happy," said Boudin's lawyer, Leonard Weinglass. "What I heard on the phone were screaming and crying."

<p>Thomas Grant, a spokesman for the state Division of Parole, said Boudin would be released Oct. 1 or earlier, once her plans for parole supervision were set.

<p>Parole was granted by a two-member hearing panel after a 11/4-hour interview with Boudin at Bedford Hills state prison in Westchester County, Grant said.

<p>In prison, Boudin developed a program on parenting behind bars and helped write a handbook for inmates whose children are in foster care. She also earned a master's degree in adult education and worked to help inmates with AIDS.

<p>Boudin (pronounced boo-DEEN) has expressed remorse for taking part in the crime. Her possible release had been staunchly opposed by the families, friends and colleagues of the three men killed - Nyack Police Sgt. Edward O'Grady and Officer Waverly Brown, and Peter Paige, a Brink's guard.

<p>John Hanchar, a nephew of O'Grady, said yesterday: "Today's Eddie's birthday. He would have been 55 years old, so it's especially difficult."

<p>He added: "I just hope Boudin is sincere in her claim to be a changed woman and no other family has to suffer like ours did."

<p>Boudin, the daughter of civil rights lawyer Leonard Boudin, became a radical activist in the 1960s. She was recruited for the Brink's robbery by Black Liberation Army members and other radicals who apparently wanted to have white people driving the getaway vehicle - a U-Haul truck - to throw off pursuers.

<p>In the robbery at the Nanuet Mall, $1.6 million was stolen and Paige was killed. The police officers were gunned down when the U-Haul truck was stopped at a roadblock and the gang burst from the back with automatic weapons firing.

<p>Boudin, who had been in the truck's passenger seat, was apprehended as she fled. She pleaded guilty to felony murder and robbery and was sentenced to 20 years to life.

<p>She told the parole board in 2001 that at the time of the robbery, she thought the money would be used "to help the black community." She said she was not armed and was terrified when the gun battle ensued.

<p>After Boudin was denied parole in 2001, a judge ruled that the board had failed to take into account the recommendation of the sentencing judge that she be paroled after 20 years. That ruling led to the May parole hearing at which she was again turned down. Yesterday's hearing was her regularly scheduled parole appearance.

<p>Norma Hill, who had a gun thrust into her face during the robbery, said the parole decision was "a victory for justice and rehabilitation." She had testified against Boudin but then befriended her while doing volunteer work at the prison.

<p>Boudin has a grown son, Chesa Boudin, who was 14 months old at the time of the robbery. Raised by friends, he won a Rhodes scholarship last December and graduated from Yale University in May.
