<p>The buzz started early and refused to die down. By noon, Elmy 
Bermejo's phone and e-mail were loaded with women who wanted to talk about the 
latest published report about Arnold Schwarzenegger. The reaction, said 
Bermejo, president of the California Commission on the Status of Women, could 
be summarized in one word: "outraged."
<P>The <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1002-01.htm">article</a> in Thursday's Los Angeles Times "has been e-mailed to every 
woman from here to China," she said. "I've already gotten it three times....
<P>Hopefully this will get more people to ask questions. I've heard from people 
in Los Angeles, Sacramento and here in San Francisco."

  </table></font>With most polls showing that Schwarzenegger has made gains among female 
voters in recent weeks, political pundits, pollsters and activists watched for 
fallout from the allegations. News reports opened with the story, and callers 
flooded radio talk shows.
<P>Leaders from the National Organization for Women and local advocacy groups 
said reports that Schwarzenegger had groped and improperly touched women were 
disturbing because, if true, they illustrate his overall attitude toward women.
<P>If he felt free to harass women in Hollywood, they said, what will keep him 
from discriminating against them as governor?
<P>"It's disrespectful to all women," said Clemetine Clarke, president of San 
Francisco's Human Services Commission, who emphasized that she was speaking as 
an individual and not for the commission. "Some women will blow it off as just 
Hollywood or politics, but if you're a woman, a mother or a wife, it's 
outrageous. How would you like to have your son accused of groping?"
<P>Schwarzenegger issued an apology Thursday, but most of those interviewed 
said it was too little, too late. Some said that calling his actions "bad 
behavior" minimized the traumatic impact that harassment can have on victims.
<P>One group, the California Women's Law Center, said it will ask the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office to investigate the allegations made 
by women that Schwarzenegger groped or inappropriately touched them. "Our 
reaction is, despite the apology, that this is more than bad behavior," said 
staff attorney Marci Fukuroda. "It's criminal behavior."
<P>Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called the charges "serious" and said 
Schwarzenegger "needs to answer them.
<P>"The people of California deserve a fuller explanation than what they have 
gotten thus far," she said in a statement.
<P>But some Schwarzenegger supporters said Thursday that the uproar was coming 
mainly from his critics and that they don't think it will alienate women 
voters.
<P>"It's more political than anything right now," said Judi Partridge, chair 
of Growing Republican Opportunities for Women. "I accept his apology. The 
situation that has occurred is so long ago. These women never made a (formal) 
complaint. Obviously, at the time there were avenues, if this was a situation 
that they felt very strongly about."
<P>But some advocates said the womens' allegations point to just how difficult 
it is for women to come forward and make complaints.
<P>"Women who work in the entertainment industry often are afraid to complain 
the conditions they face about because they want to work," said Irma Herrera, 
executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, based in San Francisco. "You 
have a man who is strong and powerful. It is classic sexual harassment."
<P>Powerful people often think they are immune from getting in trouble, said 
Mollie Gregory, a writer and producer who is working on a book on sexual 
harassment and discrimination in Hollywood. Gregory said she'd been fielding 
calls all morning from women she knows or has interviewed for previous books.
<P>"I've interviewed women in Hollywood, from studio heads to gaffers, and 
every woman has a story like this," she said. "Most of them won't tell unless 
they have some protection because they might lose their jobs. That's not a 
silly thought on their part. . . . It happens so often, and women still don't 
know how to deal with it."
<P>Belle Taylor-McGhee, executive director of San Francisco's Department on 
the Status of Women, said she hopes the allegations will shed more light on 
the issue of sexual harassment. "It's disturbing to have someone in a position 
of authority suggest that rowdy behavior is considered playful," she said. "I 
don't think that women who were on the other end would see it that way."
<P>Helen Grieco, executive director of California National Organization for 
Women, which opposes the recall, said Schwarzenegger "has a sordid history of 
speaking about women in a degrading fashion, and has been the frequent target 
of sexual harassment allegations."
<P>Aside from those allegations, she said, Schwarzenegger has dodged issues 
important to women, including teen pregnancy and family planning. "Arnold 
Schwarzenegger is not a safe candidate for women personally or politically," 
she said. "He is not pro-woman, and he is not qualified to be governor of 
California."</p>
