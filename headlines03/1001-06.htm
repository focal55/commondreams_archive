<p>BAGHDAD - Police opened fire on Wednesday to  break up crowds of angry jobless Iraqis -- including former  soldiers -- demonstrating in Baghdad and Mosul as frustration  at the country's economic woes boiled over.
<P>
In another of the virtually daily attacks on occupying  forces, a female U.S. soldier was killed and three of her  colleagues were wounded by a bomb near a former palace of  ousted leader Saddam Hussein used by the U.S. military as an  army base.<P>

  </table></font>The violence formed an uneasy backdrop to the start of the  first school year since the fall of Saddam in April.<P>
The occupying powers are keen to present the return to  school as a step toward normal life, although many lack  textbooks and equipment.<P>
The volatility of postwar Iraq has helped keep the  political spotlight on the decision by President Bush and  British Prime Minister Tony Blair to go to war despite strong  opposition from many countries, including traditional allies.<P>
Opponents of the war have also called on the occupiers to  hand power quickly to local leaders. In a small step toward the  goal of self-rule, a committee of Iraqis tasked with presenting  options on how a new constitution should be drawn up submitted  its report to the U.S.-appointed Governing Council.<P>
The U.S. soldier killed in Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, was  the 82nd to die from hostile fire since Bush declared major  combat in Iraq over on May 1, Pentagon figures showed.<P>
The remote-controlled bomb exploded 300 yards from the base  as a military convoy passed by, the Army said.<P>
FLAMES AND SMOKE IN CENTRAL BAGHDAD<P>
In central Baghdad, dozens of protesters looking for work  at a U.S.-backed local security force hurled stones at the  building. Flames and black smoke poured from a police car and a  civilian vehicle while gunfire echoed around the area.<P>
Members of a crowd of several thousand threw stones at an  employment office in the northern city of Mosul. Some chanted  support for Saddam.<P>
"I need a salary now -- I've been out of work since the  war," said Ayid Khalid, 24, a former builder in the northern  city.<P>
Police and security guards fired shots in the air and the  crowd broke up.<P>
At the Baghdad protest near a hotel where Western reporters  and other foreign workers are based, police fired automatic  rifles and pistols as demonstrators took cover behind  buildings.<P>
"We didn't shoot at the beginning. We think this is a  democracy and they can express their point of view. But then  they started firing," policeman Falah Hassan said at the scene.  He said several people were wounded.<P>
Protesters said they had come repeatedly to the office of a  force set up to guard state property to look for work, but with  little result.<P>
"Most of us were soldiers and then they disbanded the army  and all the soldiers became jobless," one man said. "We've  filled out forms and two months later, still no result."<P>
The U.S.-led administration running Iraq disbanded the old  Iraqi army, viewing the force as a tool of the deposed Baath  party. The first soldiers for a new army are due to graduate  from a training course in the next few days.<P>
WILL TAKE TIME TO UNDO DAMAGE<P>
The administration says it is working hard on the economy,  making foreign investment easier and employing tens of  thousands of people in reconstruction work. But it says it will  take time to undo damage from years of war, mismanagement and  sanctions.<P>
"The sad fact is that the unemployment level in this  country is extremely high, some estimate as high as 60  percent," said administration spokesman Charles Heatly. "We  simply cannot create jobs out of thin air."<P>
A U.S. call for other nations to contribute troops and cash  for Iraq has so far met with a cool response.<P>
The European Commission on Wednesday defended its proposed  pledge of $234 million to Iraq to the end of 2004, compared to  suggestions that Baghdad needs tens of billions of dollars.<P>
External Relations Commissioner Chris Petten told a  Brussels news conference Iraq's immediate ability to absorb  funds was limited and its minister for public services, power  and water was seeking only $1.0-$1.5 billion for next year.<P>
Iraq's plunge into poverty is reflected in the state of its  schools. The occupying authorities say they have renovated  about 1,000 schools, but the new term began with many still in  disrepair and new textbooks yet to arrive.<P>
This year teachers' salaries are higher and pledges of  allegiance to Saddam and the Baath party are off the  curriculum. But postwar crime means some parents are reluctant  to let their children out of their homes to begin the new era  in education.<P>
"The salaries are a good thing," said Hana Hassan, who  works at the Dafaf al-Nil school in west Baghdad.<P>
"But I haven't seen any changes yet, apart from the  salaries. Lots of students haven't come back, they are scared.  And we don't have books."
