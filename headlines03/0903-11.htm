</table>The World Medical Association's general assembly in two weeks' time will discuss the proposed revision of the Declaration of Helsinki in a debate undertaken largely under pressure from US-based pharmaceutical giants, backed by their government.  <P>The change would qualify the specific guidelines under which doctors have to ensure that patients who take part in a trial get the best treatment for their medical condition once the tests are over.  <P>The new wording of paragraph 30 of the declaration says doctors "should make every effort to ensure" patients get any "available" drug or other treatment that the study proves is the most effective or appropriate for their condition. But they will not get it until it has been approved by the authorities in their country.  <P>That is not the case now in the UK or US, where patients in clinical trials continue to get successful new drugs on a compassionate basis after the study has ended, and before the granting of a licence.  <P>A statement from the working group proposing the changes says doctors and drug companies cannot be responsible for the inadequacies of health services in some states. "Neither sponsors nor researchers can take responsibility for deficiencies resulting from political mistakes and global economic circumstances," the statement says.   
<P>Public Citizen, the influential consumer organization founded by Ralph Nader in the US, is unhappy with the changes. It says they are being promoted by the pharmaceutical companies, the food and drug administration in the US and the government's National Institutes of Health.  
<P>In a letter to Delon Human, secretary general of the World Medical Association (WMA), Peter Lurie and Sydney Wolfe, who head <a href="http://www.citizen.org/hrg/" target="_new">Public Citizen's Health Research Group</a>, say that a proposed "note of clarification" is out of keeping with the traditional brevity of the declaration. Clarifications and footnotes are beginning to proliferate, they say.  <P>"These share two asymmetrical characteristics: they seek to water down relatively strong language in the body of the declaration, never to strengthen that language, and they are instigated by the US and the pharmaceutical industry, never by developing countries or patient groups."  <P>The industry claims a drug costs up to $800m (&#163;510m) to bring to market, although that figure is not universally accepted. Dr Lurie says in that context the cost of giving drugs to volunteer patients in poor countries at the end of a trial is not high.  <P>Public Citizen played a part in the strengthening of the declaration to protect patients in the developing world after it caused a storm in 1997 by criticizing 15 trials in Africa and Thailand to test the efficacy of affordable Aids drugs in preventing transmission of HIV from pregnant women to their babies.  
<P>Some women in the trials were given a placebo and received no drugs at all, despite the fact that the drug AZT was already known to stop infection and would have been given in the US.  <P>In 2001, Public Citizen blew the whistle on a proposed trial of a new surfactant drug in Latin America. Four of these drugs already existed and were proven to help premature babies breathe by improving the ability of the lungs to take in air. Yet researchers had asked the FDA to allow them to test the new drug against a placebo, which would, said Public Citizen, have led to babies' deaths.  <P>Yet paragraph 29 of the declaration, which addressed the placebo issue, last year became the subject of a footnote. The footnote, says Public Citizen, already clouds the obligations of doctors not to provide a placebo if there is another drug available with which the trial drug can be compared.  <P>But doctors and the sponsors of clinical trials, who include university departments as well as drug companies, say the changes are needed to prevent research from becoming too expensive and onerous to continue.  <P>Distinguished scientists agreed with pharmaceutical companies that guidelines requiring researchers to provide the best proven treatment presented problems, said Dr Human of the WMA.  <P>"If the individual scientist in the university setting interpreted it literally, it would make it almost impossible to do research," he said. Regulators and research sponsors wanted more clarity, he said.</p>
