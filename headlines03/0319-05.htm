<p>WASHINGTON -- In one of the most brutal critiques of the administration's policy 
toward Iraq by a member of Congress, East Bay Rep. Pete Stark said President 
Bush would be responsible for "an act of terror" by launching a massive 
bombing campaign to oust Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
<P>"I think unleashing 3,000 smart bombs against the city of Baghdad in the 
first several days of the war . . . to me, if those were unleashed against the 
San Francisco Bay Area, I would call that an act of extreme terrorism," said 
Stark, a Democrat from Fremont.
<P>A White House spokeswoman said Stark and other members of Congress are 
entitled to their views.
<P>"Others will judge them and decide whether or not they agree with them," 
spokeswoman Claire Buchan said.
<P>But she added: "The president has made it very clear that it is Saddam 
Hussein's choice not to take asylum or not to disarm, and that is the choice 
he is making. The president's interests are the interests of peace for the 
American people, the Iraqi people and the region."
<P>Stark's razor-tipped rhetoric was mostly an exception on a day in which 
many Bay Area lawmakers who oppose the war expressed resignation about the 
coming war.
<P>"I'm glum. I've been glum all day," said Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma. 
"I'm so saddened and disappointed that we have failed with diplomacy and in so 
doing are risking the lives of American troops and Iraqi citizens."
<P>While anti-war members of California's delegation said they will continue 
to speak out against the policy, many already are softening their rhetoric and 
stressing their support for U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.
<P>Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez, said he still believes Bush is making "a 
dangerous decision." But now, he said Congress should show unity in backing 
America's soldiers.
<P>"It's our young people who will be in jeopardy. They are the ones who are 
on the firing line," Miller said. "Now that the decision has been made to go 
to war, they are entitled to our full support."
<P>Even the few Bay Area lawmakers to back Bush's policy are spending less 
time making the case for war and more time airing their concerns about the 
potential loss of life.
<P>Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, one of the Democrats most strongly in support 
of the president's policy, said his thoughts were about military men and women, particularly the National Guard and reservists "who sacrifice so much for 
their country and receive too little in return for their families."
<P>Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Tracy, the lone Republican in the Bay Area delegation, praised Bush for making a "difficult and courageous decision."
<P>"Anytime the decision is made to send our troops in harm's way, it is never 
easy," Pombo said.
<P>Stark, a peace activist in the 1960s and a 30-year veteran in Congress, is 
known for his sharp and sometimes careless tongue. He told the Oakland Tribune 
Monday that if the president initiates the war, "it's blood on Bush's hands."
<P>His latest criticism is based on published reports that U.S. forces plan to 
fire as many as 3,000 laser- and satellite-guided missiles on Iraq in the 
first days of a military campaign.
<P>"You can't send in 3,000 bombs without some of them going awry, in spite of 
the military's claims about accuracy," Stark said in an interview Tuesday with 
The Chronicle. "If they get two-thirds accuracy that means that 1,000 bombs 
will explode (off target) inside a city of 6 million people. To me, that's a 
terrorist act."
<P>Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, said Stark's comments reflect the "deep, 
emotional sentiments" of many anti-war lawmakers.
<P>"I agree this isn't the right action to take," Honda said. "There will be 
collateral damage, and there will be civilians hurt."
<P>Also Tuesday, Republican leaders were sharply critical of Senate Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle for saying in a speech Monday that he was "saddened that 
this president failed so miserably at diplomacy that we're now forced to war."
<P>House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Daschle's remarks "may not give 
comfort to our adversaries, but they come mighty close."
<P>White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the comments were inconsistent 
with Daschle's previous remarks about avoiding "politicizing the rhetoric" 
about the war.
<P>Rallying to Daschle's defense, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San 
Francisco, repeated what Republican Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio said two weeks 
after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor: "Criticism in time of war is 
essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government."
<P>"In expressing his views, Tom Daschle is being patriotic," Pelosi said. 
"The Republican leaders are being partisan."</p><p align="center">&copy;2003 San Francisco Chronicle</p>
