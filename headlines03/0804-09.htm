<p>NEW YORK, 
Aug&nbsp;4 (IPS\GIN) - Peace activists country-wide will combine commemorations 
of the August 1945 U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with protests 
against the Bush administration's proposal to develop new, low-yield nuclear 
weapons. 
<p>More than 50 events in over 30 U.S. cities are planned 
for the coming week, including workshops, rallies, concerts and Japanese lantern 
floating as a traditional memorial for the dead. 
<p>On Monday, Aug. 6, 
1945, an atomic bomb nicknamed Little Boy was dropped from the B-29 bomber 
'Enola Gay' and detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, 
an even larger bomb, called Fat Man, was exploded over Nagasaki. 
<p>In the 
two cities, 215,000 people were incinerated instantly or died from injuries that 
year, and thousands more have died since from radiation poisoning, according to 
statistics from the A-Bomb WWW Project of Hiroshima. Japan quickly sued for 
peace and World War II ended. 
<p>Today, the administration's plans to 
develop new low-yield, earth-penetrating nuclear weapons, aimed at destroying 
underground bunkers in conventional wars, is a development that has many 
activists worried. Such a program would be contrary to the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty and in violation of Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, they say. 
<p>&#8221;This is the most dangerous U.S. administration in 
history. The Bush administration is promoting the use of nuclear weapons and 
practicing a disastrous foreign policy. Frankly, I'm terrified,&#8221; said Max 
Obuszewski, media outreach coordinator for American Friends Service Committee 
and in charge of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Commemoration in Baltimore in the state 
of Maryland. 
<p>&#8221;The count of nuclear weapons in Iraq is zero. For the U.S. 
it is 33,000, and rising,&#8221; he added in an interview. 
<p>&#8221;We mark this 
anniversary as a very stark reminder as to just how serious the U.S. government 
is about using nuclear weapons,&#8221; Leslie Cagan, national coordinator of United 
for Peace and Justice, told IPS. 
<p>&#8221;This year we need to link this 
horrible history to the present reality in which the U.S. has occupied a country 
without proving to anyone that there was a reason to go to war,&#8221; Cagan added. 

<p>The administration has also disbanded a Department of Energy panel of 
experts that provided independent oversight of the development of the U.S. 
nuclear arsenal, London's 'Guardian' newspaper reported on Thursday. 
<p>The 
move comes just days before a planned Defense Department meeting to discuss the 
so-called ''bunker buster&#8221; weapons. 
<p>One of the most prominent protests 
against the use of nuclear arms will be the ''Speakout'' at that meeting, 
STRATCOM, Aug. 1-3, in Omaha, Nebraska. 
<p>Another demonstration expected 
to draw a large crowd is scheduled for the Livermore, California nuclear weapons 
lab where, along with the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico -- both 
owned by the University of California -- every nuclear weapon in the U.S. 
arsenal has been designed. 
<p>Protesters will gather Aug. 10 to shout 
&#8221;Hiroshima and Nagasaki Never Again!&#8221; 
<p>New York City's commemoration on 
Aug. 6, the Ceremony for Peace and Disarmament, is scheduled to coincide with 
the docking of the Peace Boat, a Japanese peace organization traveling the 
world by ship. The multi-lingual event will feature international musicians. 

<p>The ceremony will be &#8221;a reminder to the global community that we have 
not forgotten and will not forget ... that we are not OK with the Bush 
administration's plans to develop new nuclear weapons&#8221;, says Susi Snyder, 
coordinator for the New York office of the Women's International League for 
Peace and Freedom, which is helping to organise the event. 
<p>Aug. 9 will 
also mark 100 days since Washington launched its war on Iraq Mar. 20. Many 
activists see the administration's aggressive tactics and the burgeoning defense 
budget in the face of economic recession as another cause for concern. 

<p>Wilson Powell, executive director of Veterans for Peace, finds the 
anniversary of the bombings particularly poignant because his father worked at 
the University of California helping to design the original atom bomb. 

<p>&#8221;In today's context,&#8221; Powell said, &#8221;this date is simply a horrific 
reminder ... the bombs have been used once against people, so they could be used 
again. In today's political environment, with tensions running high, it is more 
and more tempting to use whatever is in our arsenal. I don't remember a time as 
dangerous as the one we live in today.&#8221; 
<p>He is also deeply troubled that 
the defense budget is expanding while welfare programs and education funding 
are being cut. &#8221;Military spending impoverishes not only the economics of the 
country, but the spirit of the country,&#8221; Powell said. 
<p>After the Japanese 
Parliament's controversial decision Saturday to send troops to Iraq, possibly in 
violation of the nation's pacifist constitution, Japanese activists also 
anticipate a big week. 
<p>The World Conference Against A &amp; H Bombs will 
be held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Aug. 3-9, following a statement denouncing the 
U.S. use of force in Iraq and the use of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world.
