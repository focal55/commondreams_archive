<p>BAGHDAD - The Bush administration says Iraq is a  better place to live than before the war. Try telling that to  Baghdad citizens, whose frustrations are growing daily.

</table>Months after Saddam Hussein's fall, frequent power cuts and  water shortages disrupt the city's rhythms, unemployment and  crime loom large, and anger is rising against a U.S.-led  occupation that shows few signs of ending soon.<P>
Makeshift checkpoints are becoming permanent, webs of razor  wire and concrete slabs divert traffic, frisking and demands  for identity cards humiliate a nation renowned for its pride.<P>
Iraqis feel their destiny has been taken out of their  hands. The Governing Council was handpicked by Washington, the  police force trained by foreigners. Iraqis are impatient to  take back the reins.<P>
"When they first came, people were more or less happy  because they were fed up of dictators," Abdallah Suhail, an  engineer now working as a security guard, said.<P>
"Then we started to feel occupied. The word occupation is a  strong word. And often their behavior is aggressive and people  are starting to hate them. We feel like hostages."<P>
Iraq's U.S. administrator, Paul Bremer, acknowledged the  shifting mood in a speech to the Senate last week.<P>
"Most Iraqis welcomed us as liberators and we glowed with  the pleasure of that welcome," he said. "Now the reality of  foreign troops on the street is starting to chafe. Some Iraqis  are beginning to regard us as occupiers and not as liberators."<P>
While the north and south are relatively more stable,  resistance to the occupation is strongest in the capital and  so-called "Sunni Triangle" to the north and west. Daily  explosions and firefights have twisted nerves in central Iraq.<P>
Iraqis said the friendly waves and interaction that marked  the first weeks after the fall of Baghdad had all but gone.<P>
RUMSFELD SEES PROGRESS<P>
Nevertheless, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote in  the Washington Post last week: "I believe the plan to win the  peace in Iraq will succeed -- just as the plan to win the war  succeeded.<P>
"We have made solid progress: Within two months, all major  Iraqi cities and most towns had municipal councils -- something  that took eight months in postwar Germany," he went on, citing  the formation of an Iraqi cabinet by the Governing Council and  an independent central bank.<P>
But the U.S. army's accidental killing of civilians and the  deaths of Iraqis in anti-American guerrilla attacks have  heightened hostility toward the occupiers.<P>
U.S. soldiers said the loss of colleagues in a series of  roadside bombs targeted at their convoys had in turn made them  more nervous of local people.<P>
"Sometimes it feels like getting stabbed in the back,"  Specialist Clark Aberle said, standing at a checkpoint on a  road once known for its riverside fish grills, now a strictly  controlled thoroughfare protecting hotels used by Westerners.<P>
"We understand why we are here, we are doing the right  thing, trying to make a difference, and then you turn around  and something like that (an attack) happens."<P>
Iraqis complain that U.S. soldiers treat Baghdad as their  own. A security guard at the zoo complained that when a group  of soldiers wanted to come in after hours for a party, they  just waved a piece of paper at him and went straight in.<P>
"It was in English, I didn't understand it," he said. "What  did you want me to do? Stop them? They are the occupiers."<P>
The lawlessness in Baghdad presents Iraqis with a  unanswerable conundrum. Many want the Americans to leave, but  are scared too of the chaos that could ensue if they did.<P>
But people are impatient to see change, to start the new  lives they were promised when the United States invaded.<P>
"Maybe we Iraqis did expect too much from the American  invasion, we did hope there is going to be an easy way," Salam  Pax, an Iraqi who became famous for his Baghdad Web diaries  before and during the war, wrote last month.<P>
"Get rid of Saddam and have the Americans help us rebuild.  I don't think like that any more. I am starting to believe that  the chaos we will go through the next five or 10 years is part  of the price we will have' to pay to have our freedom."
