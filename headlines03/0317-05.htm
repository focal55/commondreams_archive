<p>BAGHDAD—An ominous pall hangs over the Iraqi capital today, where embattled President Saddam Hussein has placed troops on a final war footing as foreign diplomats, journalists and U.N. weapons inspectors scramble to flee the city.<P></P>A convoy of the last remaining foreign embassy staff was to assemble at the German consulate shortly after daybreak. <P></P>United Nations personnel were expected to follow later, in advance of the call to war by U.S. President George W. Bush.<P></P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>For the nearly 6 million residents of Baghdad, yesterday was a scramble for provision against privation.<P></P> 
Mountains of bottled water, food, batteries, and, for the privileged few, electrical generators changed hands. People mobbed pharmacies to buy antibiotics. And cars lined up 10 deep at gas pumps to fill up at the customary price of 50 dinars (three cents) a liter.
<P></P>By nightfall, Bush's fateful words echoed on television and radio from the Azores: a final day for diplomacy, "a moment of truth for the world."<P></P>
For those covering the story on the ground, weeks of mounting tension and anxiety spilled over into exodus at the sound of those words, as major media ordered their staff to evacuate. Of the 600 reporters in Baghdad one week ago, fewer than 75 are likely to remain for what appears to be almost imminent bombardment signaling the start of an American invasion.
<P></P>Those who fear a cornered Saddam may be tempted to unleash an Armageddon of banned weaponry on the streets of Baghdad took a modicum of comfort yesterday in the Iraqi leader's promise to fight a just and moral war.<P></P>"History is the most important thing, for it would never have been great if Iraqi people were not a great people," Saddam told Iraqi military commanders, as quoted in the Iraqi daily Babylon, published by his son Uday.<P></P>"We have no doubt you have inherited a great history. And you will hold it up with your principles and faith."<P></P>For the Iraqi dictator, a 12-year dance of defiance against father-and-son presidents has reached the point of final reckoning. But America's fortunes too hang in the balance, as its War on Terrorism changes course to initiate what is shaping up to be the most unpopular conflict of the modern era.<P></P>Much will depend on how — and how quickly — Baghdad falls. The city is lined now with sandbag heaps at all vital intersections, with an ever greater presence of elite Republican Guards on the streets.<P></P>Saddam entrusted his son Qusay with the protection of Baghdad and his hometown of Tikrit in a series of military orders that divided Iraq into four sectors. The Basra region went to Saddam's cousin, a general known as "Chemical Ali" for his alleged role in gas attacks on Kurds.<P></P>
Many residents of Baghdad took flight immediately prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, residing with families and renting houses in neighboring towns to sit out the bombing.
<P></P>This time, the vast majority will face the onslaught in their homes. "If they want to get out, they must smuggle themselves," said Ismail Jurani, an estate agent in the city of Baquba, an hour north of Baghdad.<P></P>"In the last war, we had so many come to Baquba. This time, they rented all the vacant homes but many are empty." <P></P>A standard three-bedroom apartment in Baquba goes for 50,000 dinars ($30) a month, a sum not easily attained by most Iraqis. One resident, Abu Mohammed, said most of those fleeing the capital are hiding with relatives to avoid drawing the attention of authorities.<P></P>"But we cannot help them now. In 1991, we brought in three families and fed them in our home the entire time," said Mohammed. "Now, it is impossible. We have no food for them."<P></P>
Signs of Iraqi military staging were evident on the northern highway from Baghdad. Anti-aircraft batteries and radar facilities were observed on the edge of town, where the first of two army checkpoints thin the traveling hordes.
<P></P>In the impoverished village of Ghalabiya, residents stood alongside an open drainage ditch, chatting nervously about what may happen next.<P></P>"We lost our electricity in 1991. We have had power only a few hours a day ever since," said villager Abu Felah. "But if the Americans come, I think it will be the same. They won't care about our little village."</p>
