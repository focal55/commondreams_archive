<p>WASHINGTON  - 
Police arrested two Nobel Peace
prize winners along with more than 60 other people protesting
on Wednesday near the White House against the U.S.-led war in
Iraq.

</table></font>Police handcuffed Mairead Corrigan Maguire, who won the
prize in 1976 for peace activism in the Northern Ireland
conflict, and Jody Williams, a 1997 winner for her work to ban
land mines, after they refused to leave Lafayette Park opposite
the home of the U.S. president.
<p>
 The Nobel laureates were detained along with religious
leaders and Vietnam-era protester Daniel Ellsberg as they sat
in a circle in the park and chanted "Peace, shalom." They held
roses as well as gruesome posters showing civilian casualties
from the war.
<p>
 Maguire told Reuters before being taken away that she
planned to stage an anti-war protest each day outside the White
House until April 18, Good Friday on the Christian calendar.
<p>
 "In Northern Ireland we were encouraged to resolve our
problems with dialogue and I would like to see that happen
here," added Maguire, who said she had asked President Bush  to
meet her.
<p>
 Williams hugged Maguire before they were both handcuffed
and loaded into a police van.
<p>
 "This is what our democracy looks like," shouted Williams
to reporters when she was handcuffed by police.
<p>
 A spokesman for the U.S. Parks Police said nine people had
been arrested for crossing a police line opposite the White
House and that the rest were held for protesting without a
permit. "We expect them all to be released within a couple of
hours," he said.
<p>
 Ellsberg, a former Marine and high-level military analyst
who leaked Pentagon  secrets about the Vietnam war to the press
in 1971, was cheered by supporters who stood behind police
barriers when he was led away.
<p>
 Catholic and Methodist bishops and a leading rabbi were
also among those arrested in the demonstration, which was
organized by the Catholic group Pax Christi.
<p>
 Bush was not in the White House at the time of the protest
but in Florida for a briefing on the war at Central Command
headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base.
<p>
 About 250 opponents of the war protested in Tampa, a few
miles away from where the president addressed troops.
<p>
 The protesters, who came from across Florida and
represented a host of anti-war and civil rights groups, could
see Air Force One with Bush aboard landing at MacDill as they
gathered for the rally.
<p>
 "The people of Florida say no to war," Mauricio Rosas, a
spokesman for the coalition, told reporters.
<p>
 In New York, 16 anti-Israel demonstrators were arrested on
Wednesday morning after chaining themselves together across
Fifth Avenue near 47th Street and disrupting Manhattan traffic
for about an hour, police said.
<p>
 Protesters were splashed with fake blood and wore t-shirts
saying "Witness to Israeli War Crimes."
