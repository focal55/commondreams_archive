<p>A car bomb today ripped through a hotel used by the United Nations as its headquarters in Baghdad, wounding a number of people, damaging the building and rocking the surrounding neighborhood. 

<p>A military spokeswoman in Baghdad said American forces had sent medical units and a quick reaction force to the Canal Hotel. 

<p>A witness to the blast said he had seen five bodies being pulled from the rubble, and American soldiers pulling sheets over the faces of others lying on the ground. 

<p>The five-story building, on the Eastern outskirts of Baghdad, houses hundreds of people from the United Nations. An entire corner of the building collapsed in the blast, and windows in the rest of the building were blown out.

<p>Another witness, Abdul Rahman al-Apshan, 35, a therapist at the hospital next to the hotel compound, said: "All of a sudden I saw myself in the air, and falling down to the ground. We didn't expect anything. This is against the Iraqi people."

<p>One more witness, Loi Badrya, said, "All of a sudden it was bang, bang — very close together."

<p>A United Nations official told the BBC that its special representative in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, was injured in the explosion.

<p>The explosion, at 4:30 p.m. Baghdad time, came after the former vice president of Iraq, No. 20 on the most-wanted list put together by the United States and one of the most zealous defenders of Saddam Hussein, was captured today, the Pentagon said.

<p>A spokeswoman, Chief Diane Perry, could not confirm reports that the capture of the official, Taha Yassin Ramadan, had been carried out by Kurdish forces in the northern city of Mosul.

<p>She would also not give any details of where Mr. Ramadan is being held.

<p>But officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in Baghdad and London said it tracked down Mr. Ramadan, a member of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, the nation's top governing body, and handed him over to United States forces, Reuters reported. 

<p>Mosul was the city where two of Mr. Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay, were found hiding last month and killed by American forces.

<p>Chief Perry said 38 of the 50 Iraqis on the most-wanted list had now been captured or killed.

<p>Confirmation of Mr. Ramadan's capture was also given by Spec. Margo Doers, a spokeswoman for the coalition's information office in Baghdad.

<p>Mr. Ramadan was a man who showed defiance and threat in the face of overwhelming American force.

<p>"Any method that stops or kills the enemy will be used," he said at an hourlong news conference in Baghdad last March after an Iraqi soldier killed four Americans in a suicide attack outside the holy city of Najaf.

<p>Arabs outside Iraq, Mr. Ramadan said, should help "turn every country in the world into a battlefield."

<p>Mr. Ramadan was one of a number of Iraqis whom American officials have said should face war crimes. Mr. Ramadan has been accused of helping suppress a Kurdish revolt in northern Iraq in the 1980's and a Shiite revolt in the south in 1991.

<p>He was one of a number of high officials, including Mr. Hussein himself, who filled Iraqis with dread and disappeared from view once the American bombing campaign began.

<p>In more violence today, a First Armored Division soldier was killed by an explosive device, United States Central Command said. The incident took place in the Karadah District at 2 p.m., a statement said.
