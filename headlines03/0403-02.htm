<p>KABUL - As the U.S-led attack on Iraq&nbsp; continues, a storm of protest is building up among women in Afghanistan who are worried about its fallout on their struggle for basic rights, which remains in the nascent stage.
<p>The protest is spearheaded by Tahmeena Faryal, a leading spokeswoman for Afghanistan-based nongovernmental organization (NGO), the <a href="http://rawa.fancymarketing.net/index.html" target="_new">Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan</a> (RAWA).
<p>Scheduled to tour southern California from April 5-11, Faryal will be focusing on the grim situation in Afghanistan, spotlighting the continuing difficulties faced by Afghan women. She will also draw parallels between the ongoing U.S. war in Afghanistan and the new war in Iraq.
<p>Afghan Women's Mission (AWM), a U.S-based organization working in solidarity with RAWA, is organizing a tour for Faryal to help raise awareness about the south Asian nation. RAWA has been long persecuted by fundamentalist forces in the region due to its stand favoring women's rights, democracy and secularism.
<p>While many in the Bush administration are lauding their campaign in Afghanistan as a model of success for Iraq, activists report that the ground reality vastly differs. "Despite promises to liberate Afghans, particularly Afghani women, the country remains highly unstable with warlords, private armies, a return to fundamentalism, and a weak U.S-backed puppet in power," said AWN in a recent press statement.
<p>The organization stressed the importance of U.S activists remaining vigilant about Afghanistan. "Before September 11, 2001, very few activists in the U.S knew what was happening in Afghanistan. After 9/11, we scrambled to learn more about this desperate country, which the U.S was bombing."
<p>"The truth is the war is still going on in Afghanistan and it is crucial we link the issue of war in Iraq with war in Afghanistan. In fact, if you want to know what to expect in Iraq, pay attention to Afghanistan," warned AWM Vice President Sonali Kolhatkar.
<p>
Similar concerns were echoed in Kabul, by the Afghan Women's Network (AWN) an umbrella organization for women's NGOs in Afghanistan, which promotes the rights of women and children at the national and international level.
<p>
"We fear that the war in Iraq would have a fallout on the women's movement in Afghanistan," said AWN's Shukria Haikal Kazimi.
<p>
Officials in the north and west of the country have pressured women not to work for foreign organizations. "This war, which is viewed by many as a conflict between the Muslim and the non-Muslim world, will give an impetus to the fundamentalists to force their conservative ideology and rules on women who are seeking equal rights," said a women's rights activist, on condition of anonymity.
<p>
Afghanistan's emergence from 24 years of conflict has triggered several positive changes in women's lives. Women are slowly re-emerging as a political and economic force, returning to the workforce and finally getting educated.
<p>
"It is after years of repression that women have got a chance to seek their just rights and several NGOs have come up in the past 11 months to help bring about a positive change in women's lives," said Kazimi.
<p>
According to AWN, over the past 11 months, the number of women's organizations working with them, has spiraled to more than 30 from the earlier number of 4-5 working underground during the Taliban era.
<p>
"This clearly indicates women's aspirations for basic rights which they have been denied all these years in Afghanistan" said an activist.
<p>
Kazimi explained that most of these organizations depended on international funds to survive and fulfil their ambitious mandate. "The war and the consequent fears of international aid being diverted are going to be concerns among women's groups which are struggling hard to find a footing," she said.
<p>
Diversion of international aid is not the only war-related issue worrying women's groups here. There are fears that the ultra-conservative local leaders and allies of the U.S-led coalition in the war against the Taliban, and the lurking fundamentalist groups may use the Iraq war to spring back to prominence once again.
<p>
Ironically, many of these conservative allies and groups continued to oppose women's full and equal participation in society. In many parts of Afghanistan, such as the under-developed western province of Herat, women face violence and remain victims of insecurity, limiting their access to public life and threatening their lives and dignity.
<p>
Worse, restrictions to the full enjoyment of fundamental freedom and human rights continue to be applied to women by local leaders in the country. In the Herat province, police have reportedly forced women to wear the <i>burqa</i>(cloak covering face and body).
<p>
According to the head of a women's NGO that was forced to function underground during the Taliban regime, attacks on female rights and free movement continue unchecked in Afghanistan.
