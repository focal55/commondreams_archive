<p>WASHINGTON  - President Bush and British Prime  Minister Tony Blair, architects of the Iraq war, will seek to  emphasize the positive when they meet on Thursday despite  postwar chaos and intelligence failures.<P>

</table></font>Their White House meeting will be the first since Blair  came under intense attack at home for the U.S.-British failure  to find Saddam Hussein's suspected weapons of mass destruction.<P>
While Blair continues to face questions about weapons of  mass destruction, Bush has come under fierce fire from  Democrats over the almost daily deaths of U.S. soldiers under  guerrilla attack in Iraq and his unsubstantiated allegation  that Saddam sought uranium from Africa.<P>
Sean McCormack, spokesman for the White House National  Security Council, said the two leaders would discuss Iraq, the  Middle East, U.S.-European relations and the war on terrorism.<P>
"They will discuss all the progress that has been made in  freeing more than 20 million people from a brutal dictator and  putting them on the path to controlling their own destiny," he  said.<P>
Blair will address a joint session of Congress before his  White House visit. He will then fly to Asia for talks in Japan,  South Korea and China.<P>
Bush so far appears to be in a stronger political situation  at home than Blair. His job approval ratings are still over 50  percent, but they are down from the 60 percent level he enjoyed  recently. Pollsters blame the decline on the steady stream of  U.S. casualties in Iraq.<P>
BLAIR STANDS BEHIND URANIUM ALLEGATION<P>
Bush is struggling to confront criticism of his State of  the Union speech last January when he said Iraq was suspected  of seeking uranium from Africa, a key detail to bolster the  U.S. argument that Iraq wanted nuclear weapons.<P>
He was forced to disown the comment and blame the CIA, but  Blair said on Wednesday he stood behind the allegation.<P>
He added that a controversial British dossier, which set  out the uranium charges and said Iraq could unleash chemical  and biological weapons at 45 minutes' notice, was accurate.<P>
"I do not accept that people were misled at all. I stand  entirely by what was in the dossier," Blair told Parliament. "I  happen to believe we still did the right thing."<P>
The U.S. side is also insistent that chemical and  biological weapons will eventually be found in Iraq. Bush and  Blair, who sent over 250,000 troops to invade Iraq and topple  Saddam in March, based their case for war on his alleged  weapons of mass destruction, but they have not been found.<P>
The United States has begun discussions with other  governments on the possibility of a new U.N. mandate for Iraq,  where Washington has had trouble finding allies to share the  burdens of reconstruction and military occupation.<P>
A new mandate, probably giving the United Nations a more  central role in running Iraq, could persuade some of  Washington's allies to contribute troops and allow the Pentagon  to withdraw some troops, whose families back home are  increasingly agitated about the mission.
