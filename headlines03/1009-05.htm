<p>The former chief accounting officer for Enron Corp.'s long-defunct energy trading unit on Thursday agreed to pay $500,000 to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations of manipulating earnings. 

<p>A civil complaint filed Thursday by the SEC said Wesley H. Colwell, 40, and others at Enron used trading profits to offset losses in a retail energy unit. The complaint also said they squirreled away higher-than-expected trading profits to report in future quarters to smooth out volatility. 

<p>According to the complaint, Colwell inflated values of assets to make Enron appear to have met earnings targets. 

<p>In the first half of 2001, for example, the reserve accounts were used to mask more than $1 billion in losses associated with Enron's retail energy business, the SEC said. 

<p>Colwell neither admitted or denied the allegations in agreeing to the settlement, the SEC said. Colwell didn't immediately return a message left at his home by The Associated Press. 

<p>Luis Mejia, a lawyer in the SEC's enforcement division, did not immediately return a call for comment. 

<p>Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra declined comment on whether criminal charges were forthcoming. He said Colwell was co-operating with the Justice Department investigation. 

<p>The complaint didn't mention others at Enron by name or title. 

<p>From September 1999 through February 2002, Colwell was chief accounting officer of Enron Wholesale Services, the umbrella organization over Enron North America, the company's once-envied trading unit that spawned copycats among peers in the energy sector. 

<p>He worked for the previous 17 years at Arthur Andersen LLP, the withered accounting firm convicted last year on charges of trying to thwart an SEC investigation by destroying Enron-related documents. 

<p>Swiss investment bank UBS Warburg acquired the trading unit and hired most of its employees - including Colwell - in early 2002, but the business failed to take off as energy trading dried up in the fallout of Enron's implosion. UBS pulled the plug on the Houston operation in December and consolidated its consolidated trading operation in Stamford, Conn. 

<p>The complaint said Colwell also will continue cooperating with probes into Enron's 2001 collapse by the SEC and the Justice Department as part of the settlement. 

<p>Colwell is the second former Enron executive to settle with the SEC. 

<p>In August 2002, Michael Kopper, once the top lieutenant to Enron's former finance chief Andrew Fastow, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges for helping run schemes that enriched himself, Fastow and others at Enron's expense. As part of his plea, he agreed to surrender $12 million in ill-gotten gains, $8 million of which went to the SEC.
