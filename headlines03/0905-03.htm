<p>After years of being arrested, banned and shunned at political debates, just being inside the building for Wednesday's nationally televised recall 
confab was a huge leap forward for Green Party faithful.
<P>National party co-chair Jo Chamberlain so expected to be tossed to the curb 
in Walnut Creek with the also-rans preening for leftover camera time that she 
brought signs and a Green banner to wave on the sidewalk. Just in case.
<P>"I kept waiting for them to say, 'You. Out!' " Chamberlain said. "Being 
included was off the charts for us."

  </table></font>Despite having 160,000 registered members in California, Greens measure 
legitimacy, in part, by being included in the debate.
<P>Now that they've got some face time and the legitimacy that follows, their 
next challenge is convincing California's sizable progressive community as 
well as its millions of disaffected voters that they won't be throwing away 
their ballot Oct. 7 by punching the hole next to "Green."
<P>Regardless of the recall outcome, Greens and other previously uninvited 
parties hope Wednesday's inclusion is a step toward changing the way debate 
guest lists are compiled.
<P>When Green candidate Peter Camejo looked into the camera during his closing 
statement Wednesday and asked viewers, "Look at the debate today. Do you want 
to go back to the day when there are only two people heard?" Third-party 
candidates used to pressing their noses against the glass cheered.
<P>"Perception is reality," said Nancy Allen, a national media coordinator 
used to fighting such battles for the Greens. "And the reality is that the 
Green Party isn't perceived if it isn't in the debates."
<P>More good news came Thursday for Camejo, as well as independent commentator 
Arianna Huffington and Republican Peter Ueberroth.
<P>Despite not having high enough poll numbers to merit an invitation to the 
California Broadcasters Association's Sept. 24 showdown -- Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's only scheduled debate appearance -- all three "will most 
likely be invited," said Kevin Coe, an association spokesman.
<P>That's a far cry from last fall, when Camejo couldn't get into a 
gubernatorial debate without a ticket from fellow candidate Bill Simon. Or in 
2000, when Medea Benjamin's supporters staged a sit-in at a San Francisco 
television station when she was banned from a U.S. Senate debate.
<P>Or when presidential candidate Ralph Nader wouldn't be admitted even to 
view a 2000 face-off, despite having a ticket.
<P>So now, with two progressive, system-bashing candidates in the recall field 
and drawing attention, it would figure that Bay Area lefties would be 
overjoyed at finally having someone to back for governor.
<P>Not necessarily.
<P><b>TOUGH CHOICE</b>
<P>Some progressive stomachs will be churning until Oct. 7 over a crisis of 
conscience that sounds downright Republican:
<P>Will they have to sublimate their heart's choice (Camejo or Huffington) and 
support Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante to avoid, as many put it, electing "another 
Pete Wilson?" For a hard-core progressive, little could be worse than seeing 
the Wilson-tutored actor Schwarzenegger in Sacramento.
<P>"I'm in that conflicted state -- I was a Nader voter in 2000," said Sam 
Dodge, a 27-year-old progressive who works with low-income housing residents 
in San Francisco's Tenderloin. Recalling how some felt that Nader cost 
Democrat Al Gore the election in 2000, Dodge is hesitant to cast a symbolic 
vote this time around -- one that would satisfy his heart, but perhaps lead to 
a Republican victory.
<P>At a recent San Francisco demonstration, Dodge shared the fears of fellow 
marchers who work on the social service front lines: A GOP governor would hack 
away at programs that affect the people he works with every day. It's hard to 
cast a symbolic vote, he said, when you have to deal with its human 
consequences.
<P>"Bustamante looks like a safe bet, but I love Arianna Huffington," said 
Dodge, who works with the Central City SRO Collaborative. "It's really tough. 
I feel that my vote could affect the thousands of people I work with down here.
"
<P>Dodge spoke as he helped shepherd 14 young activists at a recent noontime 
protest at a Ross Dress for Less store on Market Street.
<P><b>ACTIVIST TRAINING</b>
<P>The recent college graduates were part of the JusticeCorps program, a one-
week activist training program that places grads with progressive 
organizations.
<P>Some of the younger activists shouting "Hey hey, ho ho, poverty wages have 
got to go" to the surrounding sock-buyers were attracted to cage-rattlers like 
Camejo and Huffington, but unsure of the insurgents' chances. Several said 
they were undecided about which candidate they would vote for on the second 
half of the recall ballot -- as were 14 percent of the respondents to an Aug. 
16 Field Poll.
<P>"Huffington doesn't seem to be getting much support," shrugged Chrissy 
Dodson, a 22-year-old undecided voter from Berkeley who held a sign saying, 
"Profits Up, Wages Down."
<P>The veteran activists marching next to them were more wary of following 
their hearts into the voting booth -- not to mention angry that the $66 
million California may end up spending on the recall could have gone to 
schools, housing for the poor or social services.
<P>Longtime housing activist Randy Shaw smiled as he noted that his young 
charges weren't old enough to be politically aware during Wilson's eight-year 
tenure. If they were, he said, they might be more pragmatic and vote for 
Bustamante.
<P>"Many progressives are not going to waste their vote on Peter Camejo or 
Arianna Huffington," said Shaw, executive director with the Tenderloin Housing 
Clinic, which sponsors the JusticeCorps program.
<P>Greens say Democrats encourage that kind of fear-mongering to keep 
progressives under wing. Despite their candidates' low poll numbers, leaders 
of the Camejo and Huffington campaigns frequently point to Jesse Ventura's 
gubernatorial victory in Minnesota, where nobody gave the boa-wearing pro 
wrestler a chance to win until the votes were tallied.
<P>In the next few days, Huffington and Camejo representatives will ramp up 
their presence at events that draw the disaffected, like Saturday's <a href="http://www.spearheadvibrations.com/index.htm" target="_new">911 Power 
to the Peaceful Festival</a> free concert in Golden Gate Park, which is expected 
to draw more than 25,000 people.
<P>The challenge, said Van Jones, Huffington's grassroots director, is 
persuading progressives to take advantage of the "Halley's Comet" nature of 
the recall. Getting statewide recognition has never been this easy for a third 
party candidate.
<P>"If all of the progressives in California would vote for a truly 
progressive candidate, that person would win," said Jones, a longtime San 
Francisco activist. "To throw that away because of the fear of throwing your 
vote away would be a crime."
