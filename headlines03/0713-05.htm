<p>WASHINGTON, July 12 — From Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina, the Democratic candidates for president these days are scrambling for issues: denouncing President Bush's tax cuts, bemoaning his deficit, decrying the chaos in Iraq. And all too often, those issues bring restrained applause from their crowds.</p>
<P>
But there is one subject that has proved to be a surefire tonic for members of the somewhat dispirited party, and it is not the man they are trying to oust from the Oval Office.</p>
<P>
"In my first five seconds as president, I would fire John Ashcroft as attorney general," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said the other day, bringing cheers from Hispanic leaders in Phoenix. </p>
<P>
"We can not allow people like John Ashcroft to take away our rights and our freedoms," Senator John Edwards of North Carolina declared in a sweltering library in Concord, N.H., on Monday, drawing a nearly instantaneous standing ovation.</p>
<P>
Or, as Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts put it in a speech on domestic security in Lowell, Mass., last month: "When I am president of the United States, there will be no John Ashcroft trampling on the Bill of Rights."</p>
<P>
These days, it is hard to go to any event featuring a Democratic presidential candidate without hearing a condemnation of the former Missouri senator who suffered the ignominy of losing re-election to an opponent who had died in a plane crash the month before the election.</p>
<P>
Mr. Ashcroft, 61, appointed by Mr. Bush to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer to cheers from conservative Republicans and fierce opposition from Democratic senators, has assumed the mantle in American politics that has famously been filled by, for example, James Watt on the right and Hillary Rodham Clinton on the left. He has, for the opposition, become the polarizing embodiment of a party in power.    He has become the figure of scorn wandering through Democratic speeches, a boldface name in Democratic  fund-raising letters, and inevitably, advisers to several Democratic presidential candidates said, a character in political advertisements that have not even been made yet.</p>
<P>
And not incidentally, Mr. Ashcroft has also become a convenient foil for Democratic members of Congress who voted for the antiterrorism Patriot Act and are now finding themselves trying to explain that vote to liberal Democrats who are rallying behind Howard Dean, the former governor of  Vermont.  Dr. Dean denounced the act as a threat to civil liberties and has noted the favorable votes cast by his opponents, including Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Edwards,  and Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Graham of Florida. Those candidates, asked about the vote, tend to respond by denouncing Mr. Ashcroft.</p>
<P>
It is hardly unusual so early in a campaign for candidates to demonize an unpopular figure on the other side in order to draw cheers and checks from the most committed party members, who are likely to be paying attention now. Mr. Bush's campaign advisers and Mr. Ashcroft's defenders dismissed the attacks as irrelevant partisan sallies.</p>
<P>
"It is cotton candy rhetoric that is geared to extreme base voters," said Mr. Ashcroft's spokeswoman, Barbara Comstock.  "But it dissolves upon the taste test."</p>
<P>
"He's doing the job the president asked him to do  — making sure another terrorist attack doesn't happen," she said.</p>
<P>
Some Republicans expressed concern about potential damage the often unvarnished Mr. Ashcroft might cause this president. "None of those Democrats can beat George Bush, but John Ashcroft can," said one Republican strategist.</p>
<P>
But a  senior political adviser to Mr. Bush argued that no matter how unpopular Mr. Ashcroft might  be, he would not hurt the president. And this adviser suggested that there were no plans, at least  now, to try to keep Mr. Ashcroft out of public view as the election approaches.</p>
<P>
"I look at it the same way I looked at the Trent Lott thing," this adviser said, referring to the  Senate majority leader who was forced out of office after a storm over remarks he made that were denounced as racially insensitive. "People judge the party by how they view the president. They are not going to judge him by a cabinet member. And more than half the country doesn't know who he is."</p>
<P>
Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, said: "Clearly the Democrats will be able to use him as a real motivator for their troops. But ultimately, they can't run against Ashcroft. They've got to run against Bush."</p>
<P>
Still, some Democrats suggest that given the so-far-enduring popularity of Mr. Bush, Mr. Ashcroft might just have to do.</p>
<P>
For the most part, Mr. Ashcroft has drawn attacks for his record on civil liberties, symbolized by the intense surveillance and investigative tactics embraced by his Justice Department after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But he has from the start arguably been the most conservative member of Mr. Bush's cabinet, on issues ranging from abortion to gay rights, and several Democrats said he might have assumed this role even if he had not been pushed into additional prominence after the attacks.</p>
<P>
"Ashcroft has become a symbol of ideas and doctrine and ideology that are just unacceptable in the Bush administration," said Chris Lehane, who was Al Gore's press secretary and is this year advising Mr. Kerry. "He is a living, breathing troglodyte who happens to run the Justice Department."</p>
<P>
There is no doubt that the Democratic presidential contenders are receiving plenty of reinforcement of that view as they campaign among the most hard-core of Democrats who turn out for these early events.</p>
<P>
"I think he might be the most loathed man in America," said Janos Marton, 20, a Dartmouth  student who pressed Mr. Edwards on the subject of Mr. Ashcroft's civil liberties record at a town hall meeting the other night. "The way he is undermining civil liberties is disgraceful."</p>
