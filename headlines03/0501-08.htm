<p>BEIRUT   - Kirsten Scheid has braved tear gas,  water cannons and anti-U.S. sentiment to march openly through  the streets of Beirut denouncing "American terrorism" in the  Middle East.<P>
The 32-year-old American has carried banners reading "One  American against U.S. policy in the Middle East" and "Americans  against American terrorism."<P>

</table></font>Since the start of a Palestinian uprising for independence  and throughout the U.S.-led war on Iraq, she has marched  against U.S. policy she sees as pro-Israel and anti-Arab. Some  protests, including one to the U.S. Embassy, turned violent.<P>
"I walked to the front of the demonstration ... It was  getting more and more ferocious and they all just stopped and  said: 'Oh my God, there's the American,"' said Scheid, who  comes from Cleveland.<P>
"The police were saying: 'Please leave, please go, please  don't be here. It's dangerous.' I said: 'It's dangerous for all  of us. Think of what you're defending."'<P>
But Scheid, who has also appeared as a guest on Lebanese  guerrilla group Hizbollah's al-Manar television, is no longer  marching alone.<P>
During the Iraq war 20 to 25 Americans have regularly  marched against U.S. policy alongside Lebanese leftists and  Hizbollah backers. They say they have never felt unsafe  although their signs identify them as Americans and the U.S.  Embassy has advised citizens to avoid crowds.<P>
"Americans in the Arab world must speak out. Hands off  Iraq," one banner read at a recent protest.<P>
SMILES FROM SOLDIERS<P>
Scheid, who has lived in Lebanon for 10 years, is married  to a Lebanese man and has two children. She is working on  completing a doctoral degree from Princeton University.<P>
U.S. graduate student Joy Farmer, 37, from Minneapolis, has  been in Lebanon two years and has participated in protests.  Asked about the response to the protests, she said: "We get  lots of smiles from soldiers."<P>
Lebanon and political master Syria, now facing charges it  is harboring Iraqi officials and developing chemical weapons,  is opposed to the U.S. action in Iraq. It is also hostile to  Israel, which Hizbollah helped expel from south Lebanon in 2000  after a 22-year occupation.<P>
Some Lebanese media have described the Iraq war as an  "aggression" and U.S.-led troops as "occupiers," and the views  of Americans in Beirut often reflect that.<P>
"I just couldn't stay at home anymore ... The U.S.  pro-Israeli stance was just too strong," said Scheid, who first  marched in 2000 to protest U.S. ally Israel's attempts to quell  a Palestinian uprising by force. She also works on a campaign  to boycott companies that support Israel.<P>
"I carried a sign. I looked for other Americans to join me,  but they wouldn't." The war on Iraq changed that. Like many  Lebanese, some Americans in Beirut say the war is about oil,  domination and power -- not democracy.<P>
"When you look at the reasons they launched this war, it  had nothing to do with ... liberating Iraq," said Laurie Brand,  an American professor from the School of International  Relations at the University of Southern California on  sabbatical in Beirut.<P>
"I was happy to see the statues of Saddam fall. I wish the  people that had pulled all of them down were Iraqis."<P>
The activists say they will take their cue from Iraqis on  how to respond to a U.S. troop presence now that fighting is  largely over, but they feared U.S. troops would outstay their  welcome.<P>
AMERICANS FEARLESS<P>
The U.S. Embassy warned Americans to consider leaving  Lebanon after a string of bombings on Western businesses that  escalated since the start of the war.<P>
Washington blames Hizbollah for a 1983 suicide bomb attack  that blew up the previous U.S. Embassy and barred Americans  from traveling to Lebanon until 1997.<P>
But some Americans living in Lebanon -- a tiny community of  just a few thousand -- say they feel more angry at Washington  than afraid of the Lebanese and dismiss the embassy warnings.<P>
A few have left, but others question why they should take  advice from the embassy, whose staff live in a fortified  complex and are accompanied outside by armed bodyguards.<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said relations with Americans in  Beirut were "pretty good" but that some did disagree.<P>
Asked whether they know U.S. citizens in Beirut who support  the war on Iraq, Americans in Lebanon say there are not many.<P>
"They can't exactly do demonstrations," Scheid said.
