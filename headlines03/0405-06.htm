<p>HARMONY, Minn. — When Eva Barr called the county courthouse to ask about a permit for an antiwar protest, the clerk on the other end of the line went silent.</p>
<P> "Well, I don't know that I've ever dealt with such a phone call before," Ms. Barr, 36, recalled the clerk saying after a while. "I don't even know who to ask."</p>

</table></font>That was in January, when Ms. Barr concluded that "it's not exclusively for urbanites to be opposed to the established order" and decided not to drive an hour to Rochester, or two to the Twin Cities, to wave a sign.</p>
<P> Instead, she and a band of protesters calling themselves <a href="http://www.ruralpeacemakers.org/" target="_new">Rural Peacemakers</a> have spent Saturday mornings since then tromping around this corner of southeastern Minnesota, where cattle outnumber people and yellow ribbons are far more visible than "Stop War" bumper stickers.</p>
<P> In what old-timers say are the first street marches in these parts — other than on Memorial Day — the protesters paraded past the marquee proclaiming "United We Stand" outside Harmony AgriServices and the "Support the Troops" signs in the pharmacist's window in this village of 1,081. They marched through the downtowns of Canton, population 343; Chatfield, 2,394; Mabel, 766; Rushford, 1,614; and Spring Valley, 2,518. Nine people stood in Preston, population 1,426 and the county seat, the weekend before the war began, and a crowd of 81 descended on Feb. 15 on the artsy hamlet of Lanesboro, 788, where a church potluck followed the march.</p>
<P> "We're just little fishes in little ponds — all you can do is speak out, speak up," Peggy Hanson, 52, a Lanesboro City Council member, said at Chat & Chew. "A person's a person, no matter how small.'</p>
<P> "Ever read about Horton?" Ms. Hanson added, citing Dr. Seuss. "The Whos, they just made this noise, but somebody heard them. We're like Whos in Whoville."</p>
<P> It is one thing to speak up in a large crowd in a big city and quite another to do it amid the farm fields. The antiwar movement here has already learned that politics are intensely personal in communities where people do not pass each other without waving and the woman at Harmony's Village Square restaurant recognizes the voice of the caller ordering a pizza.</p>
<P> The anonymity of chanting among several hundred thousand in New York or San Francisco is unavailable on Lanesboro's Parkway Avenue, where Lydia O'Connor, whose son-in-law is in the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, stood silently writing down names as the protesters passed. Some small-business people who say they oppose the war have not joined the marches, they say, for fear of alienating customers; others who have protested report receiving nasty looks and letters. </p>
<P> In Ely, a town of 3,724 in northern Minnesota, the City Council passed an antiwar resolution and then rescinded it 10 days later after the mayor was deluged by 200 calls.</p>
<P> So while Rural Peacemakers has helped link like-minded individuals from across Fillmore County, it has also left an unspoken tension in the quilting circles and coffee-shop dice games where people stick to safe gossip, avoiding difficult issues.</p>
<P> "That's the difference between city and country — there are always consequences, social, political and economic consequences, to what you do here," said Peter Denzer, 82, a potter who lives near Rushford. "When you protest in Washington, D.C., when it's over, it's over. Here it stays with you. We see our fellow protesters all the time. We live with them. And we live with the people who see us."</p>
<P> Which is why Ms. Hanson, who owns a bed and breakfast, took the "Say No to War With Iraq" sign off her lawn after the missiles started falling on Baghdad.</p>
<P> "I don't want Lydia to have to drive by my house and see that sign," she said of Mrs. O'Connor. "I don't want to make her daily life any more difficult than it already is."</p>
<P> But Mrs. O'Connor's husband, Joe, who retired after 26 years in the Army, said he could not help but feel insulted by the "War is Good Business — Invest Your Son" sign that Frank Wright — Ms. Hanson's companion, who makes wooden spoon sculptures — has in his studio.</p>
<P> At big-city demonstrations, Mr. O'Connor said, you see placards; at small-town protests, you see faces.</p>
<P> "When you stand up for an issue in a small town — was it Aristotle who said every action has a reaction?" Mr. O'Connor said over beers at the Lanesboro American Legion Post No. 40, which has 109 members. "Once hostilities start up, you're responsible as a citizen to think about more than just your views. You've got to think about your neighbors."</p>
<P> The Rural Peacemakers are echoed by pockets of protest in the nation's small towns, but they represent a small minority, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, which showed that the strongest support for the war was in rural areas, where large percentages of people have relatives deployed in the Persian Gulf region. In the poll, 82 percent of rural residents approved of the invasion, compared with 69 percent of city dwellers.</p>
<P> The small thread of dissent along the country roads here has roots in the upper Midwest's farmer-labor populism that has long questioned international entanglements. But it also reflects the growing rift between natives and newcomers — anyone without grandparents in the cemetery — as this area, like others, tries to revive the dying farm economy with tourism, drawing artists and telecommuting yuppies.</p>
<P> Consider Harmony, about 17 miles south of Lanesboro: "so small we don't even have a town drunk so we all have to take our turn," according to Myron Scheevel, 67, one of a dozen men who took part in a dollar dice game at Harmony House, the local cafe. As the story goes, the town got its name when residents were bickering over various options and an elder banged a gavel to quiet them, demanding, "Let's have harmony."</p>
<P> Joy and Bob Johnson, who have lived in Harmony since the early 1970's, used to distribute 10-page political pamphlets through the window of the A & W drive-through they owned, so no one was surprised to see them leading the local peace march.</p>
<P> Mrs. Johnson, 69, said that when she invited the women in her Monday kaffeeklatsch to join her on Saturdays, they always had something else to do. But that might just be the Harmony way of disagreeing.</p>
<P> "I think it's a joke," Ada Austin, a farm owner, said of the protests. "We've got our boys over there."</p>
<P> Referring to the Johnsons, John Ryan, a retired hog buyer, said, "When you've got a Republican regime, we've got some hard-core Democrats that protest anything."</p>
<P> Fillmore County, in which Harmony is located, voted 49 percent for Al Gore in 2000, 46 percent for George W. Bush and 4 percent for Ralph Nader. But the legislators who represent the area in St. Paul and Washington tend to be conservative.</p>
<P> Elton Redalen, a retired Republican legislator and state agriculture secretary, comes from a family that has farmed here for six generations. Every Memorial Day, Mr. Redalen, 77, takes his American flag and marches through Lanesboro. So when he heard about the Rural Peacemakers, he took his flag and planned a counterdemonstration.</p>
<P> "I needed to make sure that when the story was written that it wouldn't only be the anti-Bush, antiwar protesters," he explained.</p>
<P> "I don't hate them, I love them," he added of the peace demonstrators. "We live here. We have to get along with them."</p>
<P> In New York and San Francisco, rallies supporting and opposing the war compete for crowds and scream at each other across police cordons. Not in Lanesboro. Mr. Redalen, carrying his flag, and Mr Wright, with a "Wage Peace" sign, walked arm in arm at the head of the line, down Parkway Avenue and to the Lutheran church, where Mr. Redalen led those gathered for the potluck in a prayer.</p>
