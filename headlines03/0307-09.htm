<p>UNITED NATIONS  - The United States clashed  bitterly with France, Germany, China and Russia at the U.N.  Security Council on Friday, as all four nations stood firm  against U.S. plans to launch a war against Iraq soon.<p>

</table></font>A mixed report from U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix  on Friday left the major powers more divided than ever on the  looming war, which President Bush has threatened to launch with  or without United Nations approval.<p>

		Blix's latest report gave some backing to both sides. He  told a tense Security Council that Iraq's move to begin  destroying its al-Samoud 2 missiles constituted "a substantial  measure of disarmament" but criticized the rate at which the  Iraqis had handed over documents on prohibited chemical and  biological systems.<p>

		Bush bluntly declared on Thursday Washington would push the  Security Council for a vote within days on a resolution  authorizing the use of force against Iraq but he was ready to  go to war even if the resolution failed.<p>

		If war did come, Bush said the U.S.-led coalition would  remove the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. A "no"  vote by any one of France, China and Russia in the council  would kill the resolution.<p>

		However, going to war without U.N. approval would be  certain to stoke an already powerful anti-war movement around  the world, intensify anti-American sentiment and could shake  the political support of important allies, including British  Prime Minister Tony Blair.<p>

		German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said he found it  "incomprehensible" that the world community could abandon  peaceful efforts to disarm Iraq and opt for a war that would  bring death and destruction to thousands of "innocent people."<p>

		"Peaceful disarmament is possible and there is a real  alternative to war," he said.<p>

		French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said: "We  cannot accept an ultimatum as long as the inspectors are  reporting progress. That would mean war."<p>

		"France will not allow a resolution to pass that authorizes  the automatic use of military force," he said.<p>

		Russia and China also said they opposed war. "There is no  reason to shut the door to peace," said Chinese Foreign  Minister Tang Jiaxuan.<p>

		But Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed Blix's talk  of increased Iraqi cooperation, saying he still found "a  catalog of noncompliance" by Baghdad.<p>

		NEW RESOLUTION SET<p>

		With the United States so far unable to round up the nine  votes needed in the Security Council to pass its resolution,  Britain floated the idea of changing the text in a bid to  attract more support.<p>

		The British proposal, now backed by Washington, would give  Baghdad a short time -- until mid-March -- to cooperate fully  or face war. But Blix said it would take months for Iraq to  disarm, even if it decided to cooperate wholeheartedly.<p>

		Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog  agency, also gave his report to the Security Council, saying  there was no evidence Iraq had resumed its nuclear program.<p>

		Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bush hours ahead of  the U.N. debate that Moscow was determined to press for a  diplomatic solution. He also told Blair by telephone that a  diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis was still possible,<p>

		So far, Washington has public commitments from only  Britain, Spain and Bulgaria while five nations are opposed and  six remain publicly uncommitted.<p>

		Of the neutral nations, Mexico remained on the fence  Friday. Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez said all parties  should keep working for consensus.<p>

		Fischer said he was deeply skeptical about the British  proposal that would give Iraq a few days to disarm. He said it  would still quickly lead to war.<p>

		BRITISH TROOPS READY<p>

		In a reminder of just how close Iraq could be to invasion,  the chief of staff of the British armed forces said in Kuwait  his troops were now ready to join any U.S.-led attack.<p>

		U.S. and British planes on Friday bombed a mobile radar  system in southern Iraq, the U.S. military said. U.N. observers  on the Iraq-Kuwait frontier said parts of a fence along the  border had been cut down, in apparent preparation for war.<p>

		Bush has dismissed Iraq's destruction of some banned  missiles as a charade and reiterated he could launch a war  without U.N. approval.<p>

		"When it comes to our security, we really don't need  anybody's permission," he told a news conference on Thursday.<p>

		"If we need to act we will act and we really don't need  United Nations approval to do so," he said. "It's time for  people to show their cards, to let the world know where they  stand when it comes to Saddam."<p>

		Asian and European stock markets fell as Bush's remarks  were interpreted to mean war was virtually certain.<p>

		Adding to the tension, the Pentagon said North Korea had  declared a maritime exclusion zone off its coast in the Sea of  Japan in a step that could signal a pending new missile test.
