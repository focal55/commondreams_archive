<p>Protesters huddled together outside the Greenwich Avenue post office yesterday, demonstrating against President Bush's threats to attack Iraq and arguing that aggression could spark worldwide conflict and catastrophe.
<p> "We've kept Saddam Hussein in his box for 11 years, and all of a sudden he is a threat to us?" said Carol Schwarz, co-chairman of Peace Action Connecticut and a Greenwich resident. "We could be starting World War III. The real threat of terrorism could explode as a result of us attacking."
<p> The protest was organized by Peace Action Connecticut, the state chapter of a national grass-roots organization with about 85,000 members nationwide.<p> The roughly 20 protesters, bundled in winter hats and coats, bore placards with anti-war messages and received sporadic honks of support from passing cars, as well as occasional comments from hecklers.<p> Some members of the group will participate in a New York City demonstration on Feb. 15, a date that activist groups have designated as a worldwide day of protest against the Bush administration's proposed war on Iraq. Protests are planned in San Francisco and nearly 20 European and Asian cities.<p> President Bush made his case for war against Iraq in his State of the Union address last night, while U.N. inspections of Iraq's industrial facilities for biological, chemical and nuclear weapons production have been subject to differing interpretations.<p> "Most of the people in the country are against going to war," said 70-year-old Erris Burnett of Old Greenwich.<p> Protesters attacked what they believe is a shortsighted, aggressive push toward war by American leaders, and hypothesized about the loss of life, economic hardship and environmental damage that could result from an attack.<p> "It seems that a lot of people are just falling in line with the president," said David Emery, an 83-year-old Greenwich resident.<p> Bob Wylie, 78, said an American attack on Iraq could inspire more terrorist attacks, and said America would be judged harshly for devastating a state already weakened by Hussein's despotism and a decade of U.N. sanctions.<p> "My question is, what is the rush?" the World War II veteran said. "Iraq is absolutely impoverished and totally toothless, militarily. Many of their neighbors are already sympathetic to them."<p> Emery said U.N. inspection teams would serve as a warning system for potential Iraqi aggression as long as they were allowed to remain.<p> "As long as the inspection teams are allowed there, it is unlikely Saddam would make any significant moves," he said. "Having them on site could be very effective."<p> Protesters also argued that a disproportionate amount of resources were being directed to the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, choking out domestic security measures.<p> Peter Arguimbau, 51, said that the Bush administration should emphasize alternative fuel sources to break its dependency on foreign oil.<p> An environmentalist and artist, Arguimbau said that catastrophic environmental damage would result if nuclear devices were detonated or if Iraqi soldiers set their country's oil fields on fire.<p> "I'm concerned about my children being able to grow up with fresh water and wholesome food," he said. "I think that we're headed for a disaster."
