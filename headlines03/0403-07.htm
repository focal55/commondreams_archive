<p>LONDON  - 

Nashville-born soul singer Edwin Starr,
whose 1970 hit "War" denounced conflict as good for "absolutely
nothing," has died aged 61 from a heart attack at his home in
central England, his manager said on Thursday.

</table></font>"Edwin passed away at his Nottingham home on Wednesday
afternoon following a heart attack," manager Lilian Kyle told
Reuters by telephone.
 <p>
 "I am absolutely saddened and shaken up by his death. He
was performing right until the end," she said.
 <p>
 Starr -- born Charles Hatcher -- gained fame in the mid
1960s with a series of soul hits, including "Agent
Double-O-Soul," which he promoted by appearing in a short film
with original James Bond actor Sean Connery.
 <p>
 Starr signed to the Motown record label and racked up more
hits in the United States and Britain, where his gutsy and
strident style earned him a huge cult following.
 <p>
 His most memorable numbers were foot-stompers "25 Miles"
from 1969 and 1970's visceral number one hit "War," a
thundering indictment against war that earned him a Grammy
award and includes the lines: <p><i> "War has shattered many young men's dreams </i>
 <p><i>We've got no
place for it today </i>
 <p><i>They say we must fight to keep our freedom
but Lord </i>
 <p><i>There's just got to be a better way."
 </i> 
 <p>
 Starr himself served in the U.S. army for three years
before embarking on a career in music.
 <p>
 U.S. rock star Suzi Quatro, who met Starr as a teenager in
Detroit, led the tributes to the soul legend.
 <p>
 She told BBC Online: "He was the best. There was nobody
better on the stage and he was the nicest man you could ever
wish to meet."
 <p>
 Starr shifted from soul to disco in the late 1970s then
moved to Britain in the 1980s where he toured repeatedly on
oldies and soul revues.
 <p>
 More recently, he played at charity events and was due to
perform at the international music festival Womad -- World of
Music, Arts and Dance -- in Reading, southeast England, in
July.
 <p>
 In a 2000 interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper he
analyzed the secret of his success:
 <p>
 "I just take care of myself," he said. "I never drink. I've
never been involved with drugs. I don't let the business
control me. I don't feel the need to be in the public eye. I've
never searched for adulation, and I'm not gonna start, at this
point in my life, to do so."
