<p>International pressure group <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/homepage/" target="_new">Greenpeace</a> today stepped up its campaign against war with Iraq by blocking a major UK military port, according to the charity.
<P>
At 9am today, Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior dropped anchor at Marchwood, Southampton, blocking the entrance to the military supply port.

Rainbow Warrior Blocks Military Port<br>

</table></font>As well as blockading the Hampshire harbour, two 
Greenpeace protesters have climbed aboard a military supply ship, according to a Greenpeace spokeswoman.
<P>
In the past two weeks the support arm of the Navy, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, has been despatching a fleet of ships loaded with tanks, helicopters and Royal Marines headed to the Gulf.
<P>
The nine RFA ships will be supporting the Royal Naval Task Group headed by the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.
<P>
The Greenpeace spokeswoman said the aim of today's action is to disrupt the naval ships joining the military build-up in the Gulf.
<P>
She said: "Rainbow Warrior has blockaded the UK military port of Marchwood at Southampton.
<P>
"We want to cut the military supply chain to the war in Iraq.
<P>
"Day and night ships and containers have been loaded up with helicopters and tanks at Marchwood bound for the Gulf.

</table></font>"We have got some Greenpeace climbers who have attached themselves to one of the supply vessels and Rainbow Warrior is anchored directly across the mouth of the military docks.
<P>
"This peaceful action is part of a global campaign to prevent a war that will kill hundreds of thousands of people and increase the chances of weapons of mass destruction being used.
<P>
"We want to stop this relentless rush towards a war which is basically placing a higher price on oil than blood."
<P>
The spokeswoman added that the Rainbow Warrior had a team of 25 protesters and Greenpeace intended to keep the ship in position at Marchwood as long as possible.
<P>
A protester was arrested today as he attempted to board a military supply ship, according to a Royal Navy spokesman.
<P>
At about 9am, military police detained the man after he climbed on the jetty at the Marchwood port.
<P>
But two other protesters managed to climb aboard two merchant ships leased by the Ministry of Defence as supply vessels.

</table></font>One of the ships currently in dock is destined for the Falkland Islands, with the other due to join the Navy Task Group heading for the Gulf.
<P>
A Navy spokesman said the actions of Greenpeace had so far not disrupted the loading of the ships.
<P>
He added that Rainbow Warrior would not be allowed to delay the planned departure of the ships later today - but declined to say what action would be taken to stop the blockade.
<P>
The spokesman said: "One person was arrested by the military police and two others got on board the ship. One was on the top of a mast and the other was dangling over the side painting a slogan on the side of the ship.
<P>
"Nothing has been delayed so far, we are continuing with the operation. The loading has not been disrupted, it is continuing and it will not be prevented in any way.
<P>
"I cannot speculate on what Rainbow Warrior will do but if they decide to break the law then they will lay themselves open to arrest."
<P>
Police patrol boats despatched by both the civilian police and military police are patrolling the Rainbow Warrior today, according to a spokeswoman for Hampshire Police.

</table></font>The spokeswoman said that at present no action had been taken against the campaign ship but the marine units, as well two patrol cars, were on stand-by.
<P>
The MoD today said responsibility for dealing with the blockade lay with the civil authorities.
<P>
A spokesman said: "Greenpeace, like any other lobby group, are able to demonstrate peacefully.
<P>
"But if they cause hindrance to operations or any other activity then the port authorities will need to take action.
<P>
"If they are breaking the law then civil authorities will take charge of it."
