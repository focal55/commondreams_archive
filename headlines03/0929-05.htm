<p>In a blow to supporters of the Kyoto treaty, President Vladimir Putin said Russia had yet to decide whether it will ratify the landmark environmental pact, which needs Moscow's approval to come into force.</p>
<p>"The Russian government is meticulously examining this question and is studying all of the difficult problems associated with it," Putin said on Monday as he opened a five-day conference on climate change in Moscow.</p>
<p>"The decision will be taken at the end of this work and in conformity with Russia's national interests," he told the gathering of some 1,200 experts from 43 countries.</p>

  </table></font>Putin said that "restrictions should not be enacted that would restrict economic growth and social development."<p></p>
<p>His words dealt a blow to Kyoto supporters, who had been hoping to convince Russia to ratify the 1997 treaty during this week's <a href="http://www.wccc2003.org/index_e.htm" target="_new">World Conference on Climate Change</a> in Moscow.</p>
<p>"This is incontestably a step backwards," Enno Harders, the head of Germany's delegation, told AFP. </p>
<p>"By holding this scientific conference, Russia is confirming its interest in the fight against climate change," said French Environment Minister Roselyne Bachelot. </p>
<p>"We would like to see her go further by ratifying the Kyoto protocol," she added.</p>
<p>Observers said that Putin's comments reflected the backroom negotiations that Russia was conducting on the pact.</p>
<p>"There is political haggling going on," ecologist Alexei Yablokov told Moscow Echo radio. "Russia wants to extract the maximum political advantage from the signing of the protocol."</p>
<p>In the past several days, Russian and foreign experts said that Moscow would make its decision on the Kyoto treaty on economic and political criteria, rather than purely ecological considerations.</p>
<p>An official in the presidential administration said last week that Russia would only ratify Kyoto if it received firm guarantees on investment and on the sale of emission rights.</p>
<p>European officials have already ruled out such a prospect as unrealistic.</p>
<p>The Kyoto protocol, signed in 1997, provides for a worldwide reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases held responsible for global warming, notably carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>To come into force it requires the ratification of countries representing at least 55 percent of the global total of carbon dioxide emissions. With the United States refusing to ratify the treaty, Russia's signature is needed to pass the threshold. </p>
<p>The treaty requires industrialized countries to stick to pollution quotas -- the amount of pollution it can discharge into the atmosphere -- based on a 1990 benchmark.</p>
<p>It also contains a mechanism by which nations can trade their quotas.</p>
<p>Because much of Russia's industry has gone offline since 1990, the treaty favors Russia -- by 2010 its CO2 emissions will be between 11 and 25 percent below the benchmark 1990 levels, according to the last Russian report to the United Nations.</p>
<p>In other words, Moscow would have pollution quotas for sale once the treaty enters into force.</p>
<p>In September 2002 Putin and Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov hinted strongly at a Johannesburg summit that Russia would eventually ratify the pact. But since then, Russian officials have issued a series of contradictory statements.</p>
