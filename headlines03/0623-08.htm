<p>SACRAMENTO, CA -- A spectacle -- part Mardi Gras, part nightmare --
rolled through downtown Sacramento on Sunday as nearly
2,000 protesters and an army of riot-gear-clad police
hit the streets.</p>

</table></font>The chaotic scene was a precursor to an even larger
rally and march beginning at 10 a.m. today at the
state Capitol. Organizers have taken out a march
permit for 8,000 people. Their target: an
international agriculture conference, hosted by the
U.S. government, that starts today at
the Sacramento Convention Center.</p>
<p>
 Despite the massive disruption downtown Sunday, police
arrested just 36 demonstrators, including
14 who disobeyed orders to disperse near the IMAX
theater, where conference participants saw a screening
of a 3-D movie on the international space station.</p>
<p>
 Earlier in the day, milling activists upended trash
bins, tore down chain-link fences
and briefly charged officers with the city's own
street barricades -- sending a police car into rapid
reverse to evade the protesters. A cadre of activists
also took over the site of the former Mandella
Community Garden in midtown.</p>
<p>
 "Hundreds of us are gathered here to say 'No' to the
corporate takeover of the food system," said Leda
Dederich, an organizer of the protest, which she said
drew more than 130 groups. "We are here to promote and
defend sustainable agriculture and to protest the
dangerous practice of genetically engineered food."</p>
<p>
 The catalyst for the massive protest is the
international Ministerial Conference and Expo on
Agricultural Science and Technology, hosted by the
United States to showcase farm technology and
scientific know-how.</p>
<p>
 Its aim, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, is to ease famine and hunger around the
world. Delegations from more than 100 nations are
expected to participate in the three-day conference.
The invitation-only event will bring together
representatives from governments, academia and the
private sector.</p>
<p>
 Protesters contend the meeting is not about ending
hunger, but rather is a stage for the United States to
push its agenda on other countries, an agenda that
promotes big-business interests and technology,
specifically the genetic engineering of crops.</p>
<p>
 The conference comes as the United States is pushing
the World Trade Organization to force Europe to accept
genetically modified food.</p>
<p>
 The local protest began at 2 p.m. in Capitol Park, as
people filled the east end of the park, then moved to
the streets and around downtown before winding down
around 8 p.m. Law enforcement declined to give an
official estimate of the size of the crowd; reporters
estimated it at nearly 2,000.</p>
<p>
 The first arrest came at 4:30 p.m., when a woman
stepped into the street, blocking a CHP motorcycle
officer. When he asked her to move, she refused,
forcing him to lay down his cycle. The woman,
19-year-old Marissa Lopez of Rio Linda, then spit at
two officers, according to police.</p>
<p>
 Incongruous images of whimsy and force were the order
of the day. Merry vegetarians danced along, dressed as
ears of corn and butterflies. Beside them strode young
anarchists, masked and clad in black, who taunted
police and shouted obscenities. A female wearing fairy
wings darted through the crowd on a bike, striped
stockings flashing. An elderly man using a walker
pushed gamely along with the rest.</p>
<p>
 A raucous marching band, the Bay Area's Brass
Liberation Orchestra, added a jazzy New Orleans note
as protesters swirled through the streets around the
Convention Center. Early in the protest, organizers divided the throng
into four quadrants -- nicknamed Fire, Water, Air and
Earth -- and kept them on the move, generally ahead of
the police.</p>
<p>
 Everywhere -- lined up in front of the Convention
Center and manning street barricades -- helmeted city
police and CHP officers stood sober-faced and ready,
batons in hand. Even their horses wore
plastic visors. Helicopters buzzed overhead, while
sirens added to the cacophony. </p>
<p>
 Overall, law enforcement made its statement with sheer
numbers, rather than with mass arrests.</p>

</table></font>Several people, who said they were legal observers for
the protest organizers, videotaped the officers and
took notes of several exchanges between activists and
law enforcement. Meanwhile, a Police Department
cameraman made his own video, deftly sidestepping
protesters who tried to block his lens with bandanas.</p>
<p>
 Not every activity Sunday involved protest.
Across town, in Land Park, an organic food festival
drew several hundred families with children.
One booth promoting a vegetarian diet quickly sold out
of T-shirts reading "If it has a face, don't eat it."</p>
<p>
 Keirsten Mihos of Sacramento brought her nearly
1-year-old daughter, Olivia.</p>
<p>
 "I'm a member of the (Sacramento Natural Foods) Co-op
and I'm trying to inform myself about the USDA
conference, and I thought this was a family-friendly
way to do it," Mihos said, feeding her daughter bits
of organic string cheese.</p>
<p>
 The long day started at 6 a.m. for Sacramento Police
Chief Albert Najera, who spent much of Sunday
monitoring the protests from a command center. Joining
him were top brass from the city Fire Department, the
Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, the CHP, the
FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</p>
<p>
 They kept up with the flow of events by watching two
large video screens that streamed images fed from
traffic cameras and police helicopters.</p>
<p>
 Mindful of the destructive chaos that took place
during demonstrations at a 1999 World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, law enforcement
prepared for the worst: The CHP had more than 500
officers on duty Sunday, joined by hundreds of
city police officers.</p>
<p>
 The police walk a fine line handling political
protests, Najera said. "We have to balance public
safety with protecting people's rights to free
speech," he said.</p>
<p>
 While some marchers were in a buoyant mood, others
jeered at police, trying to provoke a response. "We're
encouraging our officers not to debate with them. It
doesn't serve any purpose. But we always tell them to
be friendly and respectful," Najera said.</p>
<p>
 Whatever happens during the conference, the experience
-- including the six months of planning for it -- has
matured and strengthened his staff, the chief said.
Sunday's demonstrators arrived from across the West
and included peace activists, union members and
organic farmers.</p>
<p>
 Among the most distinctive were restaurant workers
from some of the Bay Area's most exclusive
restaurants, including Chez Panisse, Millennium and
ACME Chophouse. They wore traditional garb, high white
chef's caps and starched tunics. One even carried a
giant whisk.</p>
<p>
 "We're here to expose the lies of big agricultural
business," said Cal Peterneu, a chef at Berkeley's
Chez Panisse. "Speaking through food can be
convincing."</p>
<p>
 A tense moment came in midafternoon when the throng
marched down J Street past the Convention Center. 
Some merchants stood on the sidewalk, arms crossed,
frowning as the marchers passed. Directly across the
street at the Capital Café, an employee opened the
door of the shuttered shop and nervously surveyed the
scene.</p>
<p>
 "I just came to check things out," said the man, who
did not want to give his name. One young protester
came by and assured him, "You're going to be OK."</p>
<p>
 One worker from the Sheraton Grand Hotel ran down the street and pleaded to
police to let him through the lines. Eventually
officers adjusted their perimeters to allow hotel
guests and workers to move in and out.</p>
<p>
 Responding to the escalating tension, the Sheriff's
Department added more jail staff to its remote booking
facility.</p>
<p>
 "They're just testing us out. We think (the
demonstrators) are trying to get a reaction, to see
how things work, where the backups come from, where
the jail facility is," said Assistant Sheriff Michael
Smith. "Unless they do something bad, there's really
no reason to arrest them."</p>
<p>
 As the day wore on, some protesters moved to the site
of the former Mandella Community Garden. Saying it was
time to take back the garden, activists removed
sections of the fence encircling the park.</p>
<p>
 After three decades, the city last year told gardeners
there to pack up their tools and leave. The Sacramento
City Council has approved a plan for a 118-unit
housing development on the part of the garden. It was
padlocked late last year when toxic chemicals were
found in the soil.</p>
<p>
 Twelve people sitting in a
circle around an apricot tree locked themselves
together with galvanized steel pipe. Dozens of others
went to work, planting lavender and cactus, mulching
with hay and spreading manure.</p>
<p>
 Three men, all masked, destroyed the no-trespassing
sign on the gate. A woman told them, "Don't get
arrested yet; we need you for tomorrow."</p>
<p>
 Late Sunday, police and firefighters moved in and
started sawing the pipe. The protesters were arrested
and are expected to be charged with trespassing,
police officials said.</p>
<p>
 Earlier Sunday evening, demonstrators and conference
participants crossed paths for the first time outside
the IMAX theater.</p>
<p>
 As 20 dignitaries filed into the theater, a Humboldt
County activist who called himself "Snap Shoe" used a
megaphone to talk to officers on horseback guarding
the entrance.</p>
<p>
 "Put down your badges, your nightsticks, your guns and
join the revolution," he said. "Get off your horses
and join the people. It is your food, too.</p>
