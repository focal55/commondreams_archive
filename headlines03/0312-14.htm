<p>HUNTSVILLE, Texas  - Minutes before Texas was to  carry out its 300th execution since resuming capital punishment  21 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday stopped Delma  Banks' death by lethal injection.

</table></font>Banks, a black man with no prior criminal record, was  sentenced to die for robbing and shooting to death Richard  Whitehead, a white 16-year-old, on April 14, 1980, in the east  Texas town of Nash. Banks was 21 at the time.<p>

		Supporters said he was wrongly convicted, his right to a  fair trial marred by alleged prosecutorial misconduct,  ineffective legal assistance and the deliberate selection of an  all-white jury.<p>

		"I just thank the Lord. Give Jesus all the credit," Banks  said. The nation's highest court acted just moments before he  was to be strapped to the gurney in the Texas death house.<p>

		He had already eaten his last meal of two double  cheeseburgers, a double order of french fries and orange juice,  which he told prison officials was good.<p>

		As word of the stay spread, supporters and relatives,  including his adult daughter, cheered and jumped for joy.<p>

		Banks' lawyer, George Kendall of the NAACP's Legal Defense  Fund, was waiting to enter the death chamber when he heard.<p>

		"There is no execution today. I think it means the court is  seriously thinking about taking this case," he told Reuters.<p>

		Kendall said he tried to see Banks, but prison officials  were preparing to return him to death row in Livingston, Texas,  about 50 miles away.<p>

		Bowie County prosecutor James Elliott, who helped win the  conviction, said it was too early to draw any conclusion other  than that the Supreme Court needs more time.<p>

		"I wish we could have brought it to a conclusion today, but  I have been here for 23 years and I'm prepared to stay here to  see it through," said Elliott, who was in his office in  Texarkana awaiting news of the execution.<p>

		Kenneth Clay, scheduled to die on March 20, is next in line  to be Texas' 300th execution. The state has carried out more  than a third of all executions since the Supreme Court lifted a  ban in 1976. Texas resumed executions six years later.<p>

		UNUSUAL INTERVENTION<p>

		Unusually, three former federal judges, including former  FBI director William Sessions, who is from Texas, filed a brief  urging the Supreme Court to hear the case.<p>

		In a one-paragraph order, the high court said the stay  would remain in effect until the justices decide whether to  hear one of the pending appeals filed by Banks' lawyers.<p>

		If the appeal is rejected, the stay of execution will end,  the court said. If the justices decide to hear the case, it  will continue until the court issues a decision.<p>

		Banks had shown that from 1975 through 1980, Bowie County  prosecutors accepted 80 percent of qualified white jurors and  eliminated 90 percent of blacks in felony cases. They used a  code, writing "b" or "n" by the names of blacks on jury lists.<p>

		Prosecutors argued they had race-neutral reasons to remove  the four potential black jurors in Banks' pool. Banks' lawyer  never objected during the trial.<p>

		The Supreme Court ruled last month that another Texas death  row inmate, Thomas Miller-El, should get a hearing to present  similar evidence of racial bias in his jury selection.
