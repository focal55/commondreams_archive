<p>BAGRAM, Afghanistan  - Provincial Afghan  authorities said at least 17 civilians had been killed in  bombing raids by U.S.-led forces that Washington says are aimed  at rooting out remnants of the Taliban.
<p>

Haji Mohammad Wali, spokesman for the government of Helmand  province, told Reuters an official of its Baghran district had  reported the civilian deaths there after relatives came to the  district headquarters.<p>

		"The people came crying, saying their relatives had died or  were missing," Wali said by telephone from Helmand's capital,  Lashkar Gah.<p>

		U.S. military officials told reporters Wednesday that B-52  and B-1 bombers had pounded a mountain ridge in central  Afghanistan after ground forces spotted about 25 armed Taliban  suspects taking up offensive positions.<p>

		Twelve suspects were captured during the operation near the  village of Lejay in the Baghran Valley Tuesday, U.S. military  spokesman Colonel Roger King told a news briefing at Bagram Air  Base, the U.S. headquarters in Afghanistan.<p>

		He said U.S. ground forces called in air support over a  period of eight hours after spotting men armed with AK-47s and  rocket grenades moving along the ridgeline.<p>

		He said he had no information about possible civilian  deaths.<p>

		Wali said the report of the civilian deaths had been passed  on to the Kabul government. He said he had no information on  casualties from fresh bombing the area Tuesday night.<p>

		Haji Jilani, a resident of Shina Keli village in the  Baghran valley, told Reuters he had seen bodies of two women,  two children and a man in a riverbed from his house on a  mountainside.<p>

		MOSTLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED<p>

		According to the reports, there were 17 deaths, mostly  women and children, he said.<p>

		A spokesman for President Hamid Karzai said he did not have  any details of casualties. However, he said the government had  asked the coalition to avoid bombing during the Eid-al-Adha  Muslim holiday, which began Tuesday and runs through Thursday.<p>

		"In general, the government prefers they shouldn't bomb in  respect of Eid days, unless it is very necessary," Tayab Jawad  said. "The government has asked them to avoid bombing during  this time."<p>

		U.S. military spokesman King said a Danish F-16 dropped a  500 pound GBU-12 bomb, while U.S. B-1 and B-52 bombers dropped  2,000 pound JDAM "smart" bombs during the latest raids.<p>

		Asked who the opposing fighters were thought to be, King  said: "We believe that they are probably most closely  associated with Taliban remnants."<p>

		About 13,000 U.S.-led coalition troops are in Afghanistan  hunting remnants of the former Taliban regime and the al Qaeda  network blamed for the September 11, 2001, attacks on the  United States.<p>

		The Afghan government has said that 48 people were killed  and 117 wounded in Uruzgan province last July when a U.S.  AC-130 gunship attacked a wedding party.<p>

		The U.S. military gave a toll of 34 dead and 50 wounded --  mostly women and children -- but said the aircraft had come  under hostile ground fire.<p>

		King said the operation in Baghran, code-named "Eagle Fury"  was continuing, as was another in the neighboring province of  Bamiyan.<p>

		"The intensity to a certain extent depends upon on the  enemy," he said. "If the enemy presents itself in a posture to  attack us, then we will engage them."
