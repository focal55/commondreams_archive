<p>GAZA  - Israel killed 10 Palestinians, most of  them civilians, in the Gaza Strip on Monday in its heaviest air  strikes for months, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon renewed a  threat to remove Yasser Arafat.<P>
About 100 people were wounded in five air raids over a  12-hour period, including a missile strike after dark on a  roadside crowd.<P>
The attacks followed an ambush by gunmen in which three  Israeli soldiers were killed in the West Bank and the launch of  eight makeshift rockets from Gaza into Israel on Sunday.<P>

  </table></font>The tit-for-tat violence dealt a severe new setback to a  stalled U.S.-backed peace plan and touched off new vows of  revenge by the Palestinians.<P>
In the bloodiest raid, medics said seven people were killed  and at least 70 wounded in a missile attack after dark on the  Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. One of the dead was a  12-year-old child, they said.<P>
One missile fired by a helicopter gunship hit a car and  another slammed into a crowd of people by the road, prompting  angry protests and calls for revenge, witnesses said.<P>
"It's a massacre. They slaughtered civilians with no  mercy," one protester at the scene said. Blood covered the  ground near the car and the wounded lay scattered around the  vehicle.<P>
The witnesses said all the dead were civilians, although  they said the car that was hit was owned by a militant.<P>
The Israeli army said helicopter gunships had chased the  car from the border fence with Israel after a group of  militants tried to cross into Israel and then fled in the  vehicle.<P>
Israel carried out three air strikes in five hours in or  near Gaza City earlier in the day, killing two militants and a  bystander and wounding 23 people. Three people were hurt in the  fifth attack, just outside Gaza City, late in the evening.<P>
TOUGH MESSAGE FROM SHARON<P>
Sharon sent a tough message to the Palestinians in a speech  to the Israeli parliament in which he criticized Arafat.<P>
"This man is the biggest obstacle to peace and therefore  Israel is determined to bring about his removal from the  political arena," he said in his 30-minute speech interrupted  frequently by heckling from left-wing and Israeli Arab  deputies.<P>
Despite his harsh words for his old enemy, Sharon said he  remained committed to the U.S.-backed Middle East "road map"  and even saw a real chance for progress toward a peace  settlement with the Palestinians in coming months.<P>
Sharon offered no new initiatives and reaffirmed many of  his hardline policies, including the decision by his security  cabinet last month to remove Arafat eventually from power.<P>
The original threat, which did not specify when or how  Israel would take action, provoked an international outcry. The  United States, Israel's key ally, opposes exiling Arafat.<P>
"Our views haven't changed...taking actions against Arafat  could prove counterproductive and would not be helpful," State  Department spokesman Adam Ereli said in Washington.<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Sharon of  undermining peace. Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie said the air  raids would not help efforts to end three years of conflict.<P>
"Most of those killed are civilians. Its the bloodiest and  most dangerous escalation in years," Erekat said.<P>
Israel and the United States have tried to sideline Arafat,  accusing him of fomenting violence in the three-year-old  Palestinian uprising for statehood, an allegation he denies.<P>
Israeli forces have kept Arafat -- the 74-year-old symbol  of Palestinian nationalism -- penned inside his West Bank  headquarters for most of the last two years.<P>
RAPID AIR STRIKES<P>
In the heaviest morning raid, a helicopter-fired missile  hit a mini-van at a traffic light in densely populated Gaza  City, sending pedestrians fleeing in panic. Two Hamas militants  were burned to death in the vehicle. One was identified as  Khaled al-Masri, a senior member of the militant Islamic group.<P>
"We will avenge your blood," Hamas supporters said through  loudspeakers as followers chanted "there is no alternative to  bombings" during a funeral march. "The Zionists will soon be  sorry when they feel our painful response," they shouted.<P>
A 35-year-old man in a nearby car was also killed in the  air attack and nine people were wounded, medics said.<P>
Three hours earlier, an Israeli warplane bombed a building  next to the home of Islamic Jihad leader Abdallah al-Shami.<P>
"Suddenly we heard a big boom and it was like an  earthquake, everything started to fall on us," said neighbor  Rawda al-Jamal, who rushed outside carrying his wounded  one-year-old son in his arms. "People were screaming and  running."<P>
The army said it had not been aiming for Shami but had  destroyed a Hamas weapons workshop next door after militants  fired primitive rockets into southern Israel on Sunday. The  fifth strike of the day also hit the same building.
