<p>AUSTIN - A Texas Department of Public Safety commander ordered the destruction of all documents and photographs dealing with the search for Democratic state legislators who fled to Oklahoma to block a congressional redistricting bill.<p>
				
A brief e-mail memo was sent to captains in the agency's Special Crimes Service the morning of May 14, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said Wednesday.<p> The order stated: "Any notes, correspondence, photos, etc. that were obtained pursuant to the absconded House of Representative members shall be destroyed immediately. No copies are to be kept. Any questions please contact me." L.C. "Tony" Marshall, commander of the DPS Special Crimes Service, signed the order.<p> It was first reported by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, which obtained the document Tuesday under the Texas Public Information Act.<p> The DPS issued a statement Wednesday saying it destroyed the records because federal regulations prohibit it from keeping intelligence information that is not part of a criminal case.<p> "This was not a criminal matter, so we could not legally maintain that information," the DPS statement said, adding that retaining the information could have subjected the agency to a $10,000 fine.<p> But state Rep. Kevin Bailey, a Houston Democrat and chairman of the House General Investigating Committee, said it appears that is true only for a federal investigation or an investigation funded by federal money.<p> "This investigation to find us ... should not have fallen under that criteria," said Bailey, one of last week's boycotting Democrats.<p> "So it raises questions again as to why that evidence was destroyed when there is no state law that I'm aware of that mandates the destruction of that information and keeps us wondering, keeps people wondering: Is there something to hide?" he said.<p> Republican House Speaker Tom Craddick ordered state troopers to find the absent lawmakers and bring them back to Austin so a quorum could be achieved in the House and the Republican-backed redistricting bill could be debated.<p> More than 50 Democratic legislators left the state before the scheduled May 12 redistricting debate and stayed at a Holiday Inn in Ardmore, Okla., and did not return to Texas until after the May 15 deadline for passage of House bills.<p> On Wednesday, Craddick said he had no knowledge of the DPS document destruction. He said he thought the issue had been blown out of proportion. "There is no conspiracy here," he said.<p> "I don't know what their procedures are or what, you know, what their rules are over there," Craddick said. "I think it's not appropriate for me to comment on what the DPS did or didn't do."<p> Craddick also said he did not direct the DPS search or interfere with it.<p> Vinger said Marshall Caskey, chief of the agency's criminal law enforcement division, gave the instructions for L.C. Marshall to order the documents destroyed.<p> "In compliance with the rules and regulations we do this every day," he said.<p> No one in state government outside of the DPS ordered or suggested that the search documents be destroyed, Vinger said.<p> DPS officials have been asked by legislators and news organizations for more information about federal involvement in tracking the private plane of former House Speaker Pete Laney, one of the Democratic lawmakers who went to Oklahoma.<p> State Reps. Lon Burnam, Yvonne Davis and Timoteo Garza - members of the House Law Enforcement Committee who were among the fleeing lawmakers - filed a Texas Public Information Act request Monday seeking all printed and electronic documents about the DPS involvement in the search. Burnam asked questions during a Public Safety Commission meeting Tuesday, but officials would not respond.<p> Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott's office, which oversees open records law enforcement, would only get involved in an investigation if a Texas Public Information Act request for the documents had been pending at the time the records were destroyed, said spokeswoman Angela Hale.<p> The office is not aware of any such requests pending at the time, Hale said. The state Library and Archives Commission deals with retention of records, and any potential violation of those rules would be investigated by the Travis County district attorney, she said.<p> Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said Tuesday he would review a decision to withhold information about his agency's involvement. He said there is an internal investigation into the matter.<p> The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has said its air interdiction agency helped search for Laney's plane after receiving a call from a DPS official who made it seem as though the plane might have crashed. The agency did not find the aircraft.<p> In Washington, U.S. Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Marshall, said the regulation cited by DPS to defend the destruction restricts use of federal criminal intelligence systems to cases when there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The Homeland Security Department said it helped DPS after being led to believe Laney's plane was in trouble, missing or had possibly crashed.<p> "It was never proper. It was never within the law. It was never within the regulation to use the system to start out with," Sandlin said.<p> Also congressional Democrats on the House floor Wednesday pushed again for more information from the Homeland Security Department. Some accused Republicans of using tax-supported, anti-terrorism agencies for political purposes.<p> "Misuse of federal law enforcement agencies for domestic political purposes. Sounds like Watergate in 1974 and Richard Nixon, doesn't it?," said Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco.<p> U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, a former Border Patrol chief, said "every single law enforcement officer knows and understands the consequences that go with the obstruction of justice, the consequences that go with lack of public trust," Reyes said.<p> U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican from Sugar Land and a driving force behind the Texas congressional redistricting plan, said last week his office investigated on Craddick's behalf whether the FBI and U.S. marshals could be used to help round up the Democratic state legislators. Questions also were being raised about any involvement by the Justice Department.<p> On Wednesday, DeLay said he would not comment on "false accusations."
