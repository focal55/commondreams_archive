<p>Should a university be producing nuclear bombs? 

<p>The University of California scored a major success Wednesday in fighting off calls for the termination of its long-held contract to run the Los Alamos National Laboratory because of a management scandal. The contract will be put up for bid when it expires in September 2005, and the university has been told it is welcome to compete. 

<p>But that compromise, which the university fought for ferociously, has forced it to confront troubling questions about what role, if any, a research university should play in designing, producing and maintaining the most destructive weapons ever created -- the stock in trade of Los Alamos and the other weapons lab UC runs, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 

<p>Until now, the university did not have to respond to that question in the same way because it was asked by the federal government to create Los Alamos 60 years ago and has run it ever since. The university has characterized its management as a call to duty. 

<p>But if it fights for the contracts, seeking them out and fending off other contenders, UC would have to justify its efforts more directly than ever before, said faculty members, administrators and others familiar with the university and the labs. 

<p>UC President Richard Atkinson acknowledged the issue Wednesday in a decidedly ambiguous victory statement. Now that UC has been given a chance to compete, he said, it has to ask whether doing so is compatible with its mission. 

<p>"The answer to that is less clear, and it goes to the fundamental nature of these particular government laboratories and the historical reasons why the university was asked to manage them as a public service," Atkinson said. 

<p>Regent Ward Connerly said the distinction between being asked to run the labs and having to compete for the contract is nonsense. 

<p>UC has benefited from the labs and the nation has benefited from UC's scientific prowess, and so the relationship should continue, he insisted. 

<p>"The university's mission is to serve the community, and in this case the country's the community," he said. 

<p>At one time, the UC faculty largely opposed the contract, but now it seems divided. Michael Nacht, dean of UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy and chairman of a Pentagon advisory panel on countering the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists, said he supports competing for the contract and stressed, "all things considered, it's been an outstanding relationship." 

<p>But Bettina Aptheker, a leader of the Berkeley Free Speech movement in the 1960s who now runs the women's studies department at UC Santa Cruz, insisted, "The one good thing out of this is that it has called into question the continued UC involvement with Los Alamos. I don't think it is appropriate for a university presumably dedicated to the pursuit of education and research for the good of humanity to engage in managing or researching its destruction." 

<p>Senior officials at other universities said a new bidding process raised a host of difficult issues for UC, from whether a new contract would restrict academic freedom at the labs to whether it would split the management of Los Alamos and Livermore. 

<p>Dr. Steven Koonin, provost at the California Institute of Technology, which also runs a major government institution, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that, until now, the relationship between UC and the Department of Energy, which owns the labs, has been relatively loosely defined. A formal bidding process would require a far more detailed contract that would ultimately give the contractors somewhat less freedom, he said. 

<p>A critical problem would be the freedom of lab scientists to speak out. 

<p>Under UC, the scientists enjoyed a relative sense of intellectual freedom, while keeping classified material secret. That might be difficult to maintain in the future, staining UC's reputation further. 

<p>"The university needs to guarantee both academic freedom and intellectual integrity," Koonin said. "It is a very difficult balance to strike and we generally haven't done it right. The DOE (Department of Energy) can now impose constraints that would make it less interesting and more difficult for a university." 

<p>Still, many insist that the contract is too big a plum to let slip away. 

<p>John Herrington, energy secretary under President Ronald Reagan, stressed that the labs are connected to California's future as a cradle of high technology and that UC should fight to keep them. 

<p>"What UC could get out of this potentially is critical," said Herrington. "If you control the program and control the whole system, you have a much better chance to shape it to your needs." 

<p>Harold Agnew, a legendary weapons scientist and director of Los Alamos from 1970-79, said UC's role has traditionally been distant. Agnew said he met far more often with members of Congress than UC officials and key policy decisions were made in Washington. 

<p>Agnew said he supports UC continuing its stewardship, but the job has grown far more complex. 

<p>"They've done a very good job, and their role is important to recruiting. But I can sympathize with the university if they don't want to bid." 

<p>Stanley Sheinbaum, a UC regent from 1977-89 and a member of a committee that oversaw the labs, said he initially fought to cancel UC's involvement for moral reasons, but changed his mind because he came to believe the university's expertise benefited the nation too much. 

<p>"I just didn't think they should be in the weapons business," he said. "But the longer I studied it, I felt the labs had to be run properly and the university was the best one to do that." 

<p>Sheinbaum supports the idea of UC pursuing the contract, but, he admitted, "it's a very different situation. It's much more difficult now."
