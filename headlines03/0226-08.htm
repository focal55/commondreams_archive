<p> WASHINGTON - Hundreds of thousands of
opponents of a U.S. war against Iraq called and faxed their
senators and the White House on Wednesday in a &quot;virtual march
on Washington&quot;, jamming many congressional telephone lines for
several hours.
<P> Coordinated by the <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org" target="_new">Win Without War Coalition</a>, an umbrella
protest group, the action aimed to direct at least one
telephone call and fax to every U.S. senator every minute
throughout the day. Organizers said they were far exceeding
that goal.
<P> The White House switchboard was also flooded and most
callers heard a message that &quot;all circuits are busy&quot;.<P> Tom Andrews, a former Democratic representative from Maine
who is running the organization, said more than 500,000 people
had signed up on the Internet to take part and a half a million
more were also expected to participate without registering on
the group's web site (<a href="http://www.Moveon.org" target="_new">Moveon.org</a>).
<P> &quot;We have hundreds of thousands of calls and faxes that we
know are going in. It's a first-of-its-kind protest and a
tremendous success already,&quot; he said. &quot;People are making their
voices heard loud and clear -- don't invade and don't occupy
Iraq.&quot;<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>The Web site had a running total of what it said was the
number of calls placed. As of 2 p.m (1900 GMT) the number had
exceeded 250,000. The web site was flashing the names of
individual protesters above a map of the United States with
quotes from e-mails sent to the headquarters and to lawmakers.
Each comment included the name and hometown on the protester.<P> Some protesters themselves had difficulties getting through
to their representatives. Molly Lanzarotta from Boston said she
had to dial multiple times to get through to an answering
service in the office of Democrat John Kerry, a leading
presidential candidate for 2004.<P> Others tried for long periods but eventually gave up. Brian
Fry tried to call from Cleveland but kept getting the message,
&quot;all circuits are busy.&quot; He said he would call his senators'
local Ohio offices instead and try to get through to Washington
again later or on the next day.<P> SET TIMES TO CALL<P> Activists were given set times to call. Chicago marketing
executive Mary Rickard was supposed to call at 3:14 p.m, 3:19
p.m. and 3:24 p.m. The faxes from people who signed onto the
Web site were also programmed to go out at set times.<P> Telephone calls placed from Reuters to various senators
received busy signals at all but two offices. At Florida
Democrat Bob Graham's office, a spokeswoman said they had
received 400 calls in the first three hours of the day, well
above the norm. At Nebraska Republican Charles Hagel's office,
a spokeswoman said the front desk did not seem to be any busier
than usual.<P> Andrews said the Internet had emerged as a key tool for the
anti-war movement in organizing protests and instantly reaching
tens of thousands of activists.<P> &quot;It allows us to be in touch instantly with activists all
around the country and the world. It's a tremendous democratic
tool,&quot; he said.<P> Hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions more in
cities around the world have taken to the streets in a series
of demonstrations over the past few weeks.<P> However, the latest polls show a substantial but not
overwhelming majority of American voters support President
George W. Bush on Iraq. Surveys suggest that around 35 to 40
percent of the electorate opposes the war.<P> A Time/CNN poll conducted Feb. 19-20 found 54 percent said
the United States should use military action to remove Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. The number was down 5 points from two
weeks before and at its lowest level since last November.
Thirty eight percent said they were opposed.<P> Pollster Jennifer Laszlo, a Democrat who has recently
conducted four focus groups, said support for the war was soft
and opponents were far more intense in their views than many
supporters.<P> &quot;Republicans think this is America's war but Democrats more
and more see it as Bush's war and they are getting more
energized and more angry,&quot; Laszlo said.
