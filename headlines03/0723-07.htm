<p>WASHINGTON -- House lawmakers voted today to block a new 
regulation that would allow individual companies to buy up television stations 
reaching nearly half the nation's viewers.

</table>The provision, included in a 
spending bill approved 400-21, would roll back part of a Federal Communications 
Commission decision overhauling decades-old restrictions governing ownership of 
newspapers and television and radio stations. That June 2 ruling by the 
Republican-dominated FCC was a victory for media companies who sought relaxed 
rules.
<p>
<!-- Blank placeholder ad -->
Opponents, from consumer groups to songwriters to small broadcasters, 
say the changes could lead to a wave of mergers leaving a dwindling number of 
companies controlling what people see, hear and read. They are urging Congress 
to roll back all the changes, but the House measure only addresses TV station 
ownership.
<p>
The FCC voted to allow single companies to own TV stations reaching 
45 percent of U.S. households. The House measure would return the cap to 35 
percent.
<p>
"It's extremely rare to be able to reverse a regulatory decision that 
gives away the store to the big boys," said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chief 
sponsor of the provision to derail the FCC change.
<p>
The fight now moves to the 
Senate, where several lawmakers of both parties want to include a similar 
provision in their version of the spending bill. Broader rollback efforts also 
are being considered.
<p>
Top Republicans are hoping that, with leverage from the 
threat of a first-ever veto by President Bush, the final House-Senate compromise 
bill later this year will drop the provision.
<p>
FCC Chairman Michael Powell 
defended his agency's decision before the House vote.
<p>
"We created enforceable 
rules that reflect the realities of today's media marketplace," Powell said in a 
statement. "The rules will benefit Americans by protecting localism, competition 
and diversity."
<p>
The FCC also allowed individual companies to own more TV 
stations in some cities and largely ended a ban on one company owning a 
newspaper and a broadcast station in a community.
<p>
Michael Copps, one of two 
Democrats on the five-member FCC who opposed the changes, told the Senate 
Commerce Committee that the new rules "surrender awesome powers over our news, 
information and entertainment to a handful of large conglomerates."
<p>
The 
committee voted last month for a bill that would undo much of the FCC changes, 
including rolling back the ownership cap and reinstating the broadcast-newspaper 
cross-ownership ban.
<p>
A bipartisan group of senators also have introduced a 
"resolution of disapproval" to undo all of FCC's changes. To succeed, the 
seldom-used legislative maneuver would need majority approval in the Senate and 
House and the president's signature.
<p>
With resistance from Republican leaders 
in the House, the prospects for legislation opposing the new ownership rules had 
initially appeared bleak.
<p>
"We've been facing a total roadblock on doing 
anything in the House," said Gene Kimmelman, public policy director for 
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. He said the House vote 
meant "that roadblock will be torn apart."
<p>
Many media companies said the FCC 
changes were needed because the old restrictions hindered their ability to grow 
and compete in a market changed by cable TV, satellite broadcasts and the 
Internet.
<p>
News Corp., owner of Fox, and Viacom Inc., which owns CBS and UPN, 
benefit from a higher national TV ownership cap because deals have left them 
above the 35 percent level. If that lower level is ultimately enforced, the 
companies could be forced to sell stations.
<p>
Smaller broadcasters said a higher 
cap would allow the networks to gobble up stations and take away local control 
of programming. The major networks wanted the cap eliminated.
<p>
NBC lobbyist Bob 
Okun praised the FCC decision and called the House legislation "extremely 
disappointing."
<p>
On Tuesday, a White House budget office statement threatened a 
veto if the final bill contains the FCC provision or something similar. The 
administration said the new FCC rules "more accurately reflect the changing 
media landscape and the current state of network station ownership, while still 
guarding against undue concentration in the marketplace."
<p>
The FCC provision 
was included last week in a $37.9 billion measure financing the departments of 
Commerce, State and Justice next year.
