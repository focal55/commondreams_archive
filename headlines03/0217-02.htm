<p>SAN FRANCISCO --
Most marchers were still blocks away from San Francisco's Civic Center 
Sunday and missed the passionate words of the activists and actors, rabbis and 
imams who spoke at the big rally.
<P>Yet the speakers' message, driven by loudspeakers, carried across the city.
<P>"We can stop this war!" actor Danny Glover told the thousands of peace 
marchers who had arrived at the rally by about 2 p.m., when he briefly took 
the stage in front of City Hall.
<P>"This is the first time we have gathered in such numbers before bullets 
have been shot," Glover said, echoing the wonder of many that a global peace 
movement is emerging in advance of a war.

</table></font>As the rally grew larger by the hour, and drizzles gave way to sunshine, it 
was like the Vietnam protests all over again, with anti-war signs, folk music 
and guitars. On stage, a rendition of "Strangest Dream" got the crowd swaying 
and singing, as did a sweet version of "Let There Be Peace on Earth."
<P>What differed from the protests of three and four decades earlier was the 
palpable fear that this time global annihilation is possible.
<P>"(The government) announced this week that they would not rule out the use 
of 'usable nuclear weapons,' " said Hari Dillon, president of the Vanguard 
Foundation, the coalition of groups sponsoring the march.
<P>The crowd booed loudly.
<P>"The time has come when humankind has to put an end to war, or war will put 
an end to humanity," cried Dillon.
<P>Sunday's rally, so entwined with the Middle East, sounded much like an 
interfaith service.
<P>Rabbi Pamela Frydman Baugh of the Or Shalom Jewish Community led a prayer 
on behalf of all the world "and the ordinary people of Iraq."
<P>"May they be free of violence," she prayed. "May they be free of war."
<P>A Buddhist woman had the crowd do an "open-eyes meditation," instructing 
each person to "catch the eye of someone you don't know and smile to let them 
know peace is possible."
<P>A woman in a green top and leopard print pants smiled at a gray-bearded man 
in a wheelchair, and suddenly thousands of strangers were looking at each 
other and smiling.
<P>Sister Elizabeth Padilla sang "Blessings Upon Blessings," and Lien Finau of 
the United Methodist Church declared, "Peace is possible."
<P>Suleiman Ghali of the Islamic Society of San Francisco told protesters: 
"War is not justified against anybody! We're all Americans, and we all belong 
here."
<P>"Vive la France!" cried Wilson Riles, the former Oakland Council member, 
applauding the nation that is leading global opposition to the war.
<P>David Harris, one of the nation's best-known Vietnam War protesters, told 
the crowd in a voice strained by age and activism, "We're here to save our 
country."
<P>Sitting on the grass and listening, John Daniels and Toni Dertlieva of San 
Rafael said they hope it is true.
<P>They had marched up from the Ferry Building and, in a sense, the less-than-
fiery speeches they heard now were anticlimactic. The speakers were polite. 
They were warm and inclusive -- and even willing to bless President Bush in 
hopes he would change his mind.
<P>"It's hard to feel as radical as this moment calls for because we're not in 
the middle of bloodshed yet," Daniels said.
<P>Dertlieva shook her head. "We need much more," she said. "This is not going 
to stop the well-organized machine of the government."
