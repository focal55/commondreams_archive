<p>The U.S. government is covering up the killing of Iraqi civilians, says a religious Oakland grandmother who had never been to the Middle East or put herself in serious harm's way until last week -- when she found herself amid falling bombs in Baghdad. 

<p>In a hair-raising journey through American and Iraqi battle lines to the Iraqi capital with a Christian peace group, 65-year-old Kara Speltz said Friday she found widespread death and suffering among regular Iraqis but also an amazing willingness to assist her pacifist band.

Peggy Gish, right, talks to members of the media about her experience in Iraq  as her colleague Kara Speltz, left, looks on, shortly after their arrival in the Jordanian capital of Amman late Sunday, March 30, 2003. The group of nine peace activists left Baghdad Saturday morning in three vehicles. One of them, lagging well behind the others, blew a tire past the far western small Iraqi town of Rutbah, spun out and landed on its side in a ditch. Iraqis took five injured men to Rutbah, where they found a hospital that had been bombed by U.S-led coalition forces, but Iraqi medical staff ``enthusiastically'' treated their injuries and sent them on their way.

</table></font></font>When one of their cars crashed and a member of the team began rapidly losing blood, Iraqi civilians stopped and rushed the injured to a nearby medical clinic while frantically waving a white towel out the window to an American jet overhead. 

<p>They would have gone to a hospital, but it had been bombed three days before, Speltz said in an interview from her small Oakland apartment after returning home this week. 

<p>She and her companions, the <a href="http://iraqpeaceteam.org/" target="_new">Iraq Peace Team</a>, provided the first outside confirmation of the March 26 hospital bombing. Speltz said the facility was a children's hospital in the small western Iraqi town of Rutbah. 

<p>She said they didn't learn the number of casualties, but another member of the group said an Iraqi doctor spoke of two deaths. 

<p>U.S. military officials were quoted earlier this week saying they had no knowledge of the bombing. Attempts to get comment from U.S. Central Command and Defense Department officials Friday were unsuccessful. 

<p>Speltz said she wants to counter the "government propaganda" that she believes colors most news reports. 

<p>"We're bombing the population, contrary to what the U.S. government is saying," she said. 

<p>A lifelong pacifist, Speltz arrived in Baghdad on March 25 after the nearly 14-hour drive from Amman, Jordan. At the U.S. checkpoint, the truck in front of them stood burning and the car behind had its windows shot out by American troops because it hadn't slowed down, Speltz said. 

<p>The day after the nine-member group arrived, allied bombing killed many civilians, including people in a Baghdad market, according to Iraqi authorities. The group visited the market site and found "huge craters" too big to have been made by an anti-aircraft missile, Speltz said. 

<p>U.S. officials quoted at the time said an errant bomb may have been responsible but did not confirm it. 

<p>Amid houses next to a girls' school, Speltz' group found walls pockmarked by shrapnel from anti-personnel explosives or cluster bombs. "There were no military targets there," she said. 

<p>Standing up to authority is nothing new to Speltz, a lifelong peace activist and dissident Catholic who wears the rainbow cross supporting rights of gays and lesbians. A native of Detroit who moved to the Bay Area two decades ago, Speltz works part-time for a private investigator and says the most dangerous thing she ever did before going to Iraq was "driving a school bus in Boston during forced busing." 

<p>"My feeling was that if soldiers are risking their lives to wage war, then as someone who wants to wage peace, I should be willing to take the same risks, " she said of her decision to go to Iraq. 

<p>The trip was sponsored by <a href="http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw/" target="_new">Voices in the Wilderness</a>, which gives humanitarian relief to Iraq, and <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/cpt/" target="_new">Christian Peacemaker Teams</a>, which promotes nonviolence in war-torn areas. 

<p>Three days after arriving, six members of the group were ordered out of the country after police found them photographing bomb damage in Baghdad without their government escort. The entire group decided to leave at the same time, Speltz said. 

<p>Speltz, wiping away tears, recalled their reception in Rutbah after one of their cars crashed on the way out. 

<p>"They handled our people with love and care and shared the few supplies they had. They've been under sanctions for 10 years so supplies are minimal to say the least, and when you add the bombing of their hospital, it was even more." 

<p>Cliff Kindy, 53, a Christian Peacemakers member who had been in Iraq since October and was traveling with them, was "bleeding all over the place" and "would have died from loss of blood if they hadn't tended him," Speltz said. 

<p>"They treated all our people and said whether you're Christian or Muslim, American or Iraqi, we are all one," she said, pausing as her voice broke. 

<p>"I tell you, I think if Children's Hospital (in Oakland) was bombed here by Iraqis, and Iraqis looked for help, I'm not sure they would have gotten it here -- if you remember what happened after Sept. 11. I was so touched by that -- their capacity for forgiveness, their understanding of us all being one people -- we have so much to learn from them."
