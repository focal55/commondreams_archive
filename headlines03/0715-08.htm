<p>WASHINGTON  - The White House was expected on  Tuesday to forecast a record budget deficit approaching a half  trillion dollars this fiscal year -- $150 billion worse than  its earlier projections -- with little hope of a turnaround any  time soon.<P>
Democrats said the deficit of roughly $450 billion was  close to crisis proportions and some fiscal conservatives urged  President Bush to do more to reverse the trend before it gets  any worse.<P>
"It's bleak," said one Republican congressional source.<P>

The White House expects the federal budget deficit to balloon to a record high of more than $450 billion this fiscal year. Democrats accused President Bush of using rosy economic assumptions to understate the magnitude of a budget gap approaching the half-trillion-dollar mark for the first time.

</table></font>The White House countered that the bigger deficits were  "manageable" and reflected economic and national security  priorities following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.<P>
Administration officials said the budget projections would  include, for the first time, initial costs of the war in Iraq.<P>
Military operations there and in Afghanistan have cost  roughly $4.8 billion a month -- $58 billion on an annual basis  -- which is well over initial estimates.<P>
"We are drifting into bigger and bigger deficits and what I  find alarming is that neither party is willing to give up its  political priorities to do anything about it," said Robert  Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a balanced  budget advocacy group<P>
Rising deficits have yet to become a major political issue  outside Washington, but some analysts believe that will change  if they keep climbing ahead of the 2004 presidential election.<P>
White House officials declined to comment on the new Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) projections, which congressional  aides expected to show a fiscal 2003 deficit of $450 billion or  more, with a similar gap in 2004.<P>
Just six months ago, the White House said it was expecting  a deficit of $304 billion for the current fiscal year and $307  billion next year. That was before the war in Iraq.<P>
"The numbers we're talking about are not detrimental to the  economy. ... It's most important to protect America and get the  country back to work and then fix this manageable deficit,"  said OMB spokesman Trent Duffy.<P>
But the projected deficits would eclipse the previous  record of $290 billion in 1992 when Bush's father was  president. The U.S. government then enjoyed four straight years  of budget surpluses between 1998 and 2001.<P>
The White House sought to play down the size of the  projected deficit, saying it was not a record when measured as  a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, and was helping  fund national defense.<P>
"What is (the) cost of a country that is attacked? What is  the price that the American people would have to pay if  something like that were to ever happen again?" said White  House spokesman Ari Fleischer.<P>
Democrats said federal budget deficits were approaching  crisis levels not seen since the Reagan administration, and  blamed Bush's sweeping tax cuts for the sharp reversal in the  U.S. fiscal position.<P>
As recently as 2001, White House and congressional analysts  had predicted 10-year budget surpluses of up to $5.6 trillion.  Many analysts now expect massive deficits through 2013.<P>
"As bad as the budget is going to appear, it's actually  worse," said the top Democrat on the House of Representatives  Budget Committee, Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina.<P>
Democrats and some analysts say that when Social Security  is set aside, the actual deficit could approach $600 billion,  or 5.5 percent of GDP, one of the highest since World War II.
