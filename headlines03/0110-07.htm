<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 — Under pressure from environmental and animal welfare groups, the Commerce Department agreed today to delay imposing a rule that would relax the definition of "dolphin safe" tuna.</p>
<P> The groups negotiated a deal with government lawyers that would delay any departmental action on the rule for 90 days, when the change is scheduled to enter into litigation in federal court in San Francisco.</p>
<P> The conservation groups, in turn, agreed not to seek a temporary restraining order against the government. In previous lawsuits, the groups have twice succeeded in blocking an easing of the dolphin-safe designation.</p>
<P> The action today leaves intact strict criteria that tuna producers must meet to sell their product with a "dolphin safe" label. No tuna that is caught using purse seine nets to encircle dolphins may be called dolphin safe, and there must be no dolphins killed or seriously injured in the process.</p>
<P> The deal was a victory — though a temporary one — for nine conservation groups that accused the Bush administration of ignoring what they say is scientific evidence that the fishing practices used by tuna fishermen from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America are harming depleted dolphin populations.</p>
<P> "Any time we can block trucks from rolling in from Mexico with tuna caught by killing dolphins, we'll consider that a good day," said David Phillips, the director of Earth Island Institute's International Marine Mammal Project, which is a plaintiff in the case.</p>
<P> Bill Hogarth, the director of the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service, said the administration was not backing down on the change. Officials have argued that Mexico might abandon its existing safeguards — including having monitors aboard its vessels — if it is effectively shut out of the United States market.</p>
<P> "We believe this is the best approach to the litigation, and we expect to win on the merits," Mr. Hogarth said. "We stand by our original decision to change the label, and remain convinced that this is the best means for the international conservation of dolphin populations."</p>
<P> The agreement was reached just nine days after Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans approved an easing of the dolphin-safe criteria that would allow fishermen to chase and corral dolphins in pursuit of the tuna that typically swim with them. Mexico has long pressed for the change, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has eagerly advanced it.</p>
<P> Mr. Evans's ruling was issued in conjunction with the release of a sweeping study, mandated by Congress, that tried to gauge the effects of such fishing on three varieties of dolphin. The study, carried out by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in San Diego, warned that severely diminished dolphin populations were not recovering despite efforts by Mexico and other countries to avoid killing them.</p>
<P> But the administration said the report's findings were "not conclusive," and said there was "no significant adverse impact" of fishing on dolphin populations, clearing the way for redefining "dolphin safe."</p>
<P> Some scientists who were involved in preparing the report have criticized Mr. Evans's conclusion. Two former researchers at the fisheries center said this week that their superiors shut down their investigations over the past decade into the effects of stress on dolphins in regular contact with tuna vessels.</p>
<P> Of five independent experts hired by the government to review the scientific integrity of the study, four expressed concerns about Mr. Evans's ruling.</p>
<P> Robert J. Hofman, one of the experts, said the data did not support Mr. Evans's ruling.</p>
<P> "It seems like it's inconsistent," said Dr. Hofman, who served as the scientific director of the Marine Mammal Commission for 25 years.</p>
<P> Another independent expert, Douglas Wartzok, the dean of the graduate school at Florida International University, said the adverse effects on dolphin — including stress-related damage — were "pretty clear." </p>
<P> "I felt that the indirect effects were a significant impediment to the recovery of the populations," Dr. Wartzok said. "Obviously the secretary came to a different conclusion."
