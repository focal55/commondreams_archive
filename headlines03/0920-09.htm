<p>A woman member of the US-sponsored Governing Council was shot and seriously wounded in an ambush here Saturday, as Germany, France and Britain called for a transfer of power in Iraq as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Akila Hashimi, a foreign policy expert and former member of the ousted Baath Party of Saddam Hussein, was hit twice in the stomach, once in the shoulder and once in the leg near her western Baghdad home, said Iraqi authorities.</p>

  </table></font>Her condition was serious and she underwent surgery on her abdomen, authorities said. Hashimi's driver was shot twice in the back, while witnesses said four men with her, including two brothers, were also hurt. </p>
<p>At least one suspect was arrested for the attack -- the first on the US-installed administration since the April fall of the former Iraqi president.</p>
<p>Governing Council chairman Ahmad Chalabi blamed "Saddam's assassins" for the attack, adding that Hashimi had faced repeated threats.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that the criminals were remnants of the Baathist regime and Saddam's assassins," he said.</p>
<p>Paul Bremer, Washington's top man in Iraq, led condemnation of the shooting, branding it a cowardly act that would not derail reconstruction efforts. "We are shocked and saddened by this horrific and cowardly act," he said.</p>
<p>While French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said he was "deeply moved" by the attack and sent Hashimi his "heartfelt sympathy", British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw deplored the shooting as a "senseless" and "cowardly".</p>
<p>"Assassinations do not constitute the right way to face the difficult circumstances in Iraq," said Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam, whose county opposed the US-led war to topple Saddam.</p>
<p> The shooting came amid continued violence in Iraq, with an explosion and an exchange of small arms gunfire striking the center of Fallujah as hundreds of US troops and vehicles were deployed to the hotspot town west of the capital.</p>
<p>In Berlin, the major European powers called for a transfer of power in Iraq "as quickly as possible" and for the United Nations to be given a central role in rebuilding the country.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to a so far elusive UN resolution, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said after meeting with his French and British counterparts that while they agreed on the need for a "more significant" UN role, there was still a "need for discussion."</p>
<p>"We all want to see a stable and democratic Iraq and that the transition to democracy occurs as quickly as possible," British Prime Minister Tony Blair said.</p>
<p>"It is in everyone's interest that we reach agreement (at the UN) and I believe that we will," he added.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac, for his part, said the three countries were "exactly on the same line," although he also acknowledged "differences" over the pace of the transition.</p>
<p>The trilateral talks, the first in two years, were meant to heal Europe's diplomatic wounds and find common ground on stabilizing Iraq ahead of separate meetings in the United States next Tuesday and Wednesday US President George W. Bush will hold with Chirac and Schroeder.</p>
<p>At stake is a UN resolution that would help Washington by approving a multinational force for Iraq and sharing the financial costs of rebuilding, more than five months after the fall of Saddam's regime.</p>
<p>But it would also open the way for other countries to begin contributing in earnest to stabilizing the country, where US troops are under constant attack, with anything from aid donations to training Iraqi police and a new army.</p>
<p>While Washington has accepted demands, notably from war opponents France and Germany, to bring the United Nations back to prominence, a stalemate has arisen over the timetable for restoring sovereignty to the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Berlin and Paris have shown recent signs of compromise, with the former offering to help train Iraqi police and military and the latter now talking of a "symbolic" transfer of power.</p>
<p>Bush remained pessimistic about a breakthrough being made before he attends the UN General Assembly, a year after making his case for a strong resolution against Iraq which lead to the war in March.</p>
<p>Following the Berlin summit, the White House said it wants to expand the coalition in Iraq.</p>
<p>"Our position is, we want to expand an international coalition behind the more than 30 countries that are already participating, so we welcome anything that leads in that direction," said spokeswoman Susy Defrancis.</p>
<p>But Russian President Vladimir Putin ruled out sending troops to Iraq, saying the current situation justified Moscow's earlier opposition to military intervention.</p>
<p>"In practical terms, there is no question of sending any Russian military contingent to Iraq," state media quoted him as saying.</p>
