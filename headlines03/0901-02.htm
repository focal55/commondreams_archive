<p>MEXICALI, Mexico  - Two power plants in the Far  North of Mexico may help alleviate U.S. energy needs,  but a  battle over their potential effect on the environment is  heating up.

</table>U.S.-based <a href="http://www.intergen.com/about.html" target="_new">InterGen</a> and <a href="http://www.sempraenergyresources.com/" target="_new">Sempra Energy Resources</a>  powered up  the turbines of two power plants in the Mexican border city of  Mexicali, Baja California, earlier this year, promising to  supply electricity to California consumers and hopefully  prevent another energy crisis in the state.
<P>
But the Mexicali Valley and cross-border neighbor Imperial  Valley, California, already have higher than acceptable levels  of particulate matter -- dust, ozone and carbon monoxide -- by  Mexican and U.S. standards, according to data from the Air  Resources Board of California.<P>
Environmentalists say the pollution is likely to worsen  because the companies are skirting U.S. laws by building in  Mexico, where they are not required to offset particulate  matter emissions -- or air pollution -- with community projects  that reduce regional air contamination.<P>
A coalition of Mexican and U.S. environmentalists called  the Border Power Plant Working Group filed suit in California  to halt the power flow from InterGen's La Rosita Energy  Facility and Sempra' Termoelectrica de Mexicali, both of which  began commercial production earlier this year.<P>
ILLEGAL PERMITS<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Environmental and human rights groups have charged that Bechtel, in a partnership with Shell called InterGen, circumvented U.S. environmental laws by building a power plant on the Mexican border for the sole purpose of exporting energy to the United States. The La Rosita InterGen plant located in Mexicali, Baja Calif., and partly owned by Bechtel, was the subject of a May 6, 2003, court ruling that found that the U.S. Department of Energy and Bureau of Land Management had acted illegally in granting permits to InterGen to build this power plant.</font></div>

</table>In May, U.S. District Judge Irma Gonzalez ruled the  Department of Energy illegally issued permits to connect the  Mexican plants to the U.S. power grid by failing to order a  complete environmental study of the Mexican plants' impact on  air and water in neighboring Imperial Valley.<P>
She ordered the study to settle the question and will  decide by next year if emissions are significant enough to halt  the flow of electricity into California or require additional  controls.<P>
Mike Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his  company's plant is already one of the cleanest in North  America.<P>
"We built this facility to meet the strictest standards in  California. We could set this plant down anywhere in  California," he says, noting that state-of-the-art technology  makes it cleaner than old plants operating in California.<P>
Mexican officials say the plants meet Mexican standards and  the tax revenues they generate have enabled Baja California to  make infrastructure improvements that offset pollution.<P>
Mario Juarez, under secretary of economic development for  the state of Baja California, said the state is paving many  dirt roads -- a perk partially enabled by the taxes the  companies pay and their monthly $1 million tab for using city  and state services.<P>
He notes that Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor  plans to  build a $148 million truck factory in Baja California, and  state officials are courting several other companies.<P>
In the past, energy companies have expressed interest in  building as many as 20 plants on the Mexican side of the border  to export energy to the United States, a key reason  environmental groups want strict pollution controls.
<P>
WATER A FACTOR
<P>They say the Mexicali plants will increase the levels of  airborne contaminants in the already polluted air basin and  consume about 12 million gallons of sewage water a day to cool  their turbines.
<P>
Mexican environmentalist Fernando Medina says he is not  opposed to the plants but wants to ensure that these and future  plants meet the highest standards and use a dry cooling system  to conserve water.<P>
"Mexico and the United States are fighting over water from  one end of the border to another," says Medina. "How much sense  does it make to allow big consumers of water to locate here?"  he said.<P>
Niggli said Sempra built the facility in Mexicali to avoid  California's lengthy licensing process. He estimates it would  have taken up to 22 months to license the plant in California,  but it took only five months in Mexico.<P>
The plant produces 600 megawatts of electricity that can be  sold in southern California, Arizona or northern Baja  California.<P>
The company spent about $350 million on the facility,  including $18 million on a wastewater treatment plant and $20  million on air emissions control equipment -- both strictly  voluntary, Niggli says.<P>
InterGen's $750 million facility generates about 1,000  megawatts of electricity, said InterGen vice president Stephen  Raab. InterGen is a joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell and  construction firm Bechtel Group Inc.<P>
About half the power generated is sold to the Commission  Federal de Electricidad, the Mexican power company. The other  half has been earmarked for California but could be sold  anywhere, he said.
