<p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 &#0151; There will be mountains of verbiage, eight lawyers and quadruple the usual time devoted to  arguments today as the Supreme Court  listens to opinions on the campaign-finance law that Congress passed last year. Among the  simple expressions that will take on added significance in the case are  "fat cats," "mother's milk" and "special interests."</p>
<P>
The justices are listening to the  lawyers dissect or defend a 61-page statute whose basic ideas have already inspired countless debates.</p>
<P>
Today's arguments &#0151; lasting four hours instead of the usual one hour &#0151; began to form about  three decades ago, when the Watergate scandals brought unsavory disclosures of powerful people and interest groups giving enormous amounts of money to politicians, and perhaps wanting something in return.</p>
<P>
The excesses of the Watergate era set off such waves of revulsion that Congress enacted limits in 1974 on how much people could donate to candidates for federal office, and how much the candidates could spend.</p>
<P>
Whether  money is viewed as "the mother's milk of politics" (in the words of Jesse Unruh, onetime Speaker of the California Assembly) or poison, or both, the issues are far from clear-cut. Foes of the campaign-finance law, led by Sen.  Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, argue that its restrictions are unjustified and unconstitutional, violating Americans' rights to free speech and free association.</p>
<P>
Supporters of the law counter that it is necessary to repair widespread skirting of old regulations, and that turning down the money spigots will not dry up the parties but rather force them to broaden their bases of donors.</p>
<P>
And, of course, one politician's "fat cat" is another's scrupulous patriot, and "special interests" can mean big business or big labor, or something else entirely, depending on one's perspective.</p>
<P>
No one really disputes that modern campaigns, especially those for the White House, are tremendously expensive, and that the well-heeled candidate has a big advantage. </p>
<P>
In 1976 the Supreme Court ruled that, while it was constitutional to curb donations to candidates, it was an unconstitutional infringement on free speech to limit what the candidates could actually spend.</p>
<P>
This ruling, in Buckley v. Valeo, either gutted the 1974 reform legislation, or reimposed a degree of sanity, depending on who is arguing. (The case took its title from Sen.  James L. Buckley, a one-term Conservative Party legislator from New York, and Francis R. Valeo, Secretary of the Senate at the time.)</p>
<P>
The ruling stirred the creative juices of politicians and lawyers. They came up with subtle ways to let people and organizations give money to benefit the parties of their choice, without officially giving money to benefit specific candidates, at least theoretically.</p>
<P>
Such unrestricted money from corporations, unions and individuals became known as "soft money," and many critics said it continued the long-time contamination of American politics. The flood of soft money continued unabated into the 1990's.</p>
<P>
But in 1995, two senators with not much else in common teamed up to introduce legislation to really limit the influence of money in politics. They were John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.</p>
<P>
Senators McCain and Feingold first introduced their legislation in 1995. But time and again their bill, and companion legislation in the House, failed to gain traction. </p>
<P>
Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold (and their chief allies in the House, Representatives Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, and Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts) gained crucial support in 2002, following the collapse of the <org idsrc="other-OTC" value="ENRNQ"><alt-code idsrc="other-OTC" value="Enron Corporation"/>Enron Corporation</org> and the accompanying spotlight on corporate shenanigans and political donations by corporate interests.</p>
<P>
Campaign-finance legislation finally passed both Houses by comfortable margins early in 2002, and President Bush signed it. </p>
<P>
The legislation's main features were to ban soft money and curb advertising by unions, corporations and nonprofit groups. Offsetting those limitations were increases in the amount of "hard money" that individuals could contribute directly to candidates, to $2,000 from $1,000 per election, with increases for inflation.</p>
<P>
The law took effect after last  November's elections. In May, a panel of three federal judges struck down the law's ban on soft money but said the parties could not use it to pay for televised "issue" advertisements in the weeks before Election Day.</p>
<P>
The panel stayed its ruling, meaning that the law remains in effect until the Supreme Court rules. There has been considerable speculation that the justices would like to decide the case by the time the 2004 campaigns begin in earnest. The high court could leave some provisions of the McCain-Feingold law intact while undoing others.</p>
