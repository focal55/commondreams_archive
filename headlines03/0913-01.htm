<p>GENEVA&nbsp; - Foreign ministers of the world's five  most powerful countries signaled on Saturday they were  seriously divided over how fast the United States should hand  power to local politicians in occupied Iraq.
<P>
There appeared to be virtually no chance of a breakthrough  emerging from a U.N.-called meeting in Geneva on the political  future of the war-torn country, though diplomats said the five  ministers may at least agree on a way forward.<P>

  </table></font>"This is an informal meeting so the formal discussions will  continue in New York," British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw  told reporters as he went into the session, scheduled to last  just 75 minutes.<P>
"The discussion so far at the lunch hosted by Secretary  General Kofi Annan has been very cordial, very constructive."<P>
Washington, which has de facto control in Baghdad as the  main occupying power, needs cash and troops from other nations  but says it does not believe Iraqis can take power as quickly  as European governments -- especially France -- are proposing.<P>
On the ground, opposition to the U.S. presence is growing,  underlined on Saturday in Falluja, west of Baghdad, where  Iraqis chanting "America is the enemy of God" began burying 10  police and security guards shot mistakenly by U.S. troops.<P>
Possibly adding to U.S. discomfiture, a leading member of  the U.S-appointed Governing Council in Baghdad said he and his  24 colleagues were anxious for a quick transfer of authority to  them from the U.S. civilian authorities in the country.<P>
"We are anxious to expedite the whole process, the  political process, so that we can have a constitution and  elections as soon as possible," Adnan Pachachi told Reuters.<P>
The dispute between the Big Five powers -- the permanent  members of the U.N. Security Council -- is a replay at lower  intensity of transatlantic wrangling earlier this year over  U.N. approval for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March.<P>
Joining the U.S. and France in Geneva for the Saturday  talks were the foreign ministers of Britain -- which backs the  U.S. stance -- Russia and China, which are taking a low-key  position.<P>
U.N. ROLE NEEDED<P>
With U.S.-led forces in Iraq taking casualties almost every  day and the cost of occupation mounting, Washington sees a new  U.N. resolution it has drafted as a way to coax other countries  to pitch in with cash and troops.<P>
French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin says Paris  wants a text that provides for handing executive powers over to  Iraqis, possibly within a month, and also provides for  elections by next spring.<P>
The United States says the French proposal is a recipe for  chaos in Iraq, where the governing council has little clout.<P>
Secretary of State Colin Powell said the proposal was  "totally unrealistic" and the United States would reject it.<P>
"I cannot anticipate us agreeing to any language that would  buy into what Minister de Villepin has been saying," he told  reporters on his way to Geneva late on Friday.<P>
A State Department official said Powell and Villepin met  briefly after the lunch. The official denied rumors that there  had been a heated exchange between the two men.<P>
Franco-German amendments to the draft would push U.S.  occupation forces under diplomat Paul Bremer to the sidelines.<P>
But Powell said Americans would have to stay in charge  until a new Iraqi army and police force take shape. "We are not  going to second that (U.S.) force to anyone else," he said.<P>
The Security Council's talks on Iraq earlier this year  ended in acrimony when the United States walked away, saying it  could act alone after France threatened to veto a war  resolution.<P>
France, Germany and Russia -- which all opposed the  invasion -- are now seeking to dilute the U.S. role in Iraq, in  part to prevent Washington reaping any long-term political and  economic benefit from the invasion.
<P>
Straw sought to stress that "whatever the disagreements  about the rightness or otherwise" of the Iraq war, the  international community was now united in recognizing its  responsibility to both the Iraqis and the United Nations.
