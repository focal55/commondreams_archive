<p>Scientists are preparing plans to build nuclear rockets to explore the solar system. Space engineers say the plan is essential if mankind is to send large, complex spaceships to neighboring planets and to search for life. 
<P>But campaigners say the project is a backdoor bid to put nuclear weapons in orbit and yesterday began a week-long protest - including demonstrations at Cape Canaveral.  <P>'This technology is completely unnecessary and could have a devastating global impact if there was a launch accident,' said campaigner Bruce Gagnon, of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space.  <P>But scientists insist the technology is safe. Nuclear engines would merely provide electricity for a new rocket propulsion system called the ion drive, which shoots out streams of gas particles and can run continuously for years, letting probes build up colossal velocities of more than 10 miles a second - about 36,000mph. America has tested one and Europe launched one on its Smart-1 probe to the Moon last week.  <P>But these ion engines were driven by electricity generated by solar panels. In deep space, beyond Mars, sunlight is too weak to provide enough power. Hence Nasa's decision earlier this year, as part of its Prometheus Project, to build a spaceborne nuclear reactor. 'Fitted to ion drives, these will take us to distant planets with a speed and flexibility that is utterly impossible at present,' said Alan Newhouse, the project's director.  <P>Scientists also point out that probes to the outer planets already use nuclear batteries. 'These are made of capsules of plutonium wrapped in lead,' said Cambridge astronomer Paul Murdin. 'The plutonium's radioactivity warms the lead and that heat is converted into electricity.'  <P>Such nuclear batteries are small beer compared to America's new plans, but they were enough to trigger a row in 1997, when it was discovered they were to be used on the European-American Cassini space probe to Saturn. As a result, the European Space Agency was forced to abandon future projects involving nuclear space technology, and therefore cannot be involved in further missions to the outer planets.  <P>Yet one of these worlds - Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter - is the main reason Nasa is developing its nuclear reactor. Space probes have revealed Europa to be a ball of ice with a liquid ocean inside. 'On Earth, where there is water there is life,' said Dr Murdin. 'That makes Europa very special.'  <P>Nasa wants to orbit Europa, scanning its oceans with radar scanners and high-resolution cameras for signs of life. However, the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter (Jimo) would need much more   power and time than current techniques can provide. Only advanced nuclear reactors could provide the hundreds of kilowatts of power the craft would need, said Newhouse.  <P>'We are talking about a reactor the size of a waste-paper basket. With that, we could move in and out of orbit round Europa and visit other Jupiter moons that may also have oceans and send back reams of data.'  <P>And it is not just Europa that intrigues researchers. Nasa is also considering using nuclear power plants to power bases on the Moon and Mars. In addition, Nasa is planning to launch a probe to visit Pluto, the Sun's most distant planet. As currently planned, the New Horizons mission - using old technology - would be launched in 2006 and take a further decade to fly past Pluto and its moon, Charon.  <P>'That is far too long,' said Dr Colin Pillinger, head of Britain's Beagle 2 probe, currently hurtling towards Mars. ' Probes will reach their destinations with out-of-date hardware and project scientists on pensions.'  <P>But such worries leave protesters cold. They believe Prometheus poses three major dangers. 'First, it will involve firing plutonium on launchers, and rockets blow up,' said Gagnon. 'Second, you will have to gear up production of plutonium on Earth to supply those rockets and that will inevitably lead to contamination of communities near plants.  <P>'Third, the technologies that Nasa develops will inevitably be used by the military. So its new generation of orbiting reactors will end up in the hands of Star Wars technicians who will use them to power space-based laser systems that can give America even greater world dominion.'
