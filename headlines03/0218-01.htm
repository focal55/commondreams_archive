<p>DUBAI  - Would a U.S.-led war on Iraq make
the world and the Middle East safer? Or is it more likely to
unleash a wave of anti-American rage and create more recruits
for Osama bin Laden?<P> The answer from the streets of the Middle East, official
circles, analysts, academics and clerics is almost unanimous --
a U.S. invasion will most certainly provoke a backlash, and this
could put the security of the world at risk.<P> <table bgcolor="#FFFFCC" hspace="2" vspace="2" cellspacing="0" width="150" border="0" cellpadding="3" align="RIGHT">

</table>&quot;The record in the past is that any use of force by external
powers has triggered a backlash,&quot; Sami Baroudi, professor of
political science at Beirut's Lebanese American University said.<P> With anti-U.S. sentiment already brimming in the Middle
East, an attack to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for
allegedly possessing banned weapons is seen by most analysts as
fanning the flames in an already volatile region.<P> &quot;This U.S. policy is radicalising public opinion. The United
States is pursuing an extremely dangerous policy of provoking
Arabs and Muslims. This can only result in increased terror and
violence,&quot; Middle East analyst Patrick Seale told Reuters.<P> &quot;The Arab and Muslim region is not ready for a new colonial
experience. Al Qaeda is still out there, attracting new recruits
by the day and poised to strike again,&quot; he added.<P> Many analysts believe war would fuel bin Laden's movement.<P> &quot;What do they think the presence of 100,000 U.S. troops in
the Gulf will cause if the presence of 10,000 sparked an
Islamist revolt among bin Laden's recruits?,&quot; said one diplomat
in reference to bin Laden's campaign against the U.S. troop
presence in the Arabian peninsula after the 1991 Gulf War.<P> Washington says Saddam is a menace who must be removed to
make the world safer. But many in the Arab world say the threat
comes from Israel, which has been locked in a bloody conflict
with the Palestinians for five decades -- and has an unlicensed
arsenal of an estimated 200 nuclear warheads.<P><P> ANTI-AMERICANISM ON THE RISE<P> Analysts say the strong popular sympathy the United States
received from Arab nations after the September 11 attacks on
U.S. cities has evaporated because of what is regarded as
Washington's blind support of Israel -- fuelling the widespread
belief that the United States is waging a &quot;crusade&quot; on Islam.<P> &quot;America's incorrect policy and its double standards in the
region have made people like bin Laden preserve their popularity
and become a hero especially among the youth in the Islamic
states,&quot; Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said this week.<P> One alarming factor is that anti-Americanism is growing even
among the traditionally pro-Western Arab middle and upper class.<P> &quot;There doesn't seem to be a middle ground in the Middle East
now. People who are Western-educated with liberal values and
sympathetic to the West are now hostile. Their position has been
undermined by U.S. policy,&quot; one diplomat said.<P> Arab politicians and academics have deep suspicion about
U.S. intentions. They say Israel and its hawkish American
allies, many of whom hold top jobs in the U.S. administration of
President George W. Bush, are trying to get America to destroy
Israel's enemies and control oil in the Gulf.<P> Observers point out that U.S. intervention in the region has
almost always provoked a backlash. The 1991 Gulf War, in which a
U.S.-led alliance that included 13 Arab and Muslim states freed
Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, was something of an exception.<P> &quot;In 1991, there was quite a bit of understanding from the
Arab governments and even from the Arab street (about) why the
U.S. had to lead the alliance to evict Iraq from Kuwait. But in
this case, there is no pretext, so we will probably see more
anti-U.S. activities,&quot; Baroudi said.<P><P> U.S. SEEN AS BULLYING MUSLIMS<P> While Saudi Arabia was the key launchpad for the 1991 Gulf
War, many Arabs believe the situation is different now.<P> &quot;At that time, Iraq was the obvious aggressor in a conflict
between Muslim countries,&quot; said Saudi bricklayer Mohammad. &quot;Now
a non-Muslim superpower is bullying a helpless Muslim nation.&quot;<P> Two more U.S. interventions are also embedded in Arab minds.
Israel's initially U.S.-blessed 1982 invasion of Lebanon,
mounted to drive Palestinian guerrillas from the country, led
directly to the birth of the Hizbollah guerrilla group, blamed
for kidnappings and suicide attacks on U.S. targets.<P> Just as that invasion spawned Hizbollah, many observers
believe U.S. support for Israel over the past decade has enabled
Islamist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad to displace
mainstream Palestinian nationalism in the fight against Israel.<P> And even the 1991 Gulf War ended by spurring support for bin
Laden, who seized on the U.S. troop presence in Saudi Arabia as
a rallying cry. Analysts say another war will make things worse.<P> Even Kuwait, the only Arab country overtly in favour of war
on Iraq, and which has every reason to be thankful to America
for its liberation, anti-American sentiment is growing and a
series of attacks since October has targeted Americans.<P> The drumbeat of war has sharpened emotions in this intensely
religious region, and many Muslims, as in other societies in
times of conflict, are turning to the mosque as their rallying
ground. Often, the message they hear is a radical one.<P> In a recent sermon, Saudi Arabia's top cleric warned more
than two million pilgrims that the West wanted to destroy Islam.<P> &quot;This is a war on Islam. The infidels want to attack Arab
and Muslim nations by attacking Saddam,&quot; said Khaled, a Saudi.<P> Analysts say the prospect of war will make it far easier for
bin Laden and other militant groups to gather recruits.<P> &quot;Bin Laden is one of an army of people who feel this way,&quot;
Seale said. &quot;This anti-imperialist, anti-American movement...is
not a single organisation, it is recruiting lots of small groups
who are enraged by the U.S. and who want to hit back.&quot;<P> &quot;Bush is keeping them (bin laden followers) in business,&quot;
added one Arab diplomat. &quot;With Bush as a recruiting sergeant
these people will be in business for another generation.&quot;<P> <i>(Additional reporting by Merhdad Balali in Riyadh, Edmund
