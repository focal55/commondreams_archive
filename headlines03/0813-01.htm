<p>Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader got a taste of California's increasingly messy recall
election Tuesday when he endorsed fellow party member Peter Camejo's run for governor - and ended up with pie on his face.
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="120">
    <tr valign="top">
      <td width=120 align=right><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><img border="0" src="images/0813-01.jpg" width="120" height="90"><br>

    </font> </td>
    </tr>
  </table></font>Appearing at the Green Party's San Francisco headquarters, Nader said California voters should take advantage of the unprecedented recall, calling it "a great opportunity for people to rethink their role in a democratically governed system."
<p>
He said Camejo understood the state's fiscal crisis better than other candidates.
<p>
Nader's endorsement of veteran activist Camejo was expected, but the routine show of political support took an unscripted turn when a prankster burst into the room and slammed a cream pie on the consumer advocate's face.
<p>
As TV cameras rolled, Nader reflexively threw remnants of the pie in the direction of the culprit, who fled out a side door and was not apprehended.
<p>
Camejo later suggested the pie assault was the work of Democrats who may feel threatened by the Green Party's growing popularity.
<p>
Some Democrats blame Nader for helping put President George W. Bush in the White House by siphoning off votes from Vice President Al Gore, the party's presidential nominee in 2000. Nader adamantly denied the spoiler charge, saying the Democrats ran a lackluster presidential campaign.
<p>
Appearing on a recall ballot that could feature nearly 250 names, Camejo said nobody could charge that he was splitting the liberal vote when dozens of Democrats and Republicans are running.
<p>
He said the state should adopt a run-off election system that was fairer to third-party candidates.

  </table></font>Camejo, who ran for governor last fall and finished third with 5.3 percent of the vote, said the recall election represents the 13-year-old Green Party's best opportunity yet to win the governorship. If voters decide to recall Gov. Gray Davis, the
replacement candidate with the most votes wins, even with a small percentage of the votes.
<p>
"I want Davis out, and I want his entire financial team removed," said Camejo, 63. "I would stop all the cutbacks. I
would get rid of the waste. And I would make the taxes fair."
<p>
Members of the Green Party of California are scheduled to decide on Aug. 14 whether to endorse the recall of Gov. Davis as well as Camejo's candidacy. Ross Mirkarimi, a state party spokesman, said the party may choose to reject the recall, but support Camejo.
<p>
Camejo said he plans to campaign with Arianna Huffington, a political commentator who also appeals to liberal and independent voters, and will seek votes among union members, young people and minorities, particularly Latinos.
<p>
Camejo, whose parents were from Venezuela, blasted movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is the leading candidate in recent polls, for his support of Proposition 187, which sought to deny many services to illegal immigrants in 1994. The ballot measure was supported by a majority of the public, but outraged many Hispanics.
<p>
"The Latino community is going to rise up here," Camejo said. "We are not going to tolerate having another governor who's for 187."
<p>
Camejo, who has never held elective office, ran for president in 1976 as a candidate for the Socialist Workers of America.
<p>
He owns a company that promotes socially responsible investing.
<p>
Camejo has said he will be running on a liberal platform that favors universal health care, legalizing marijuana and raising income taxes on businesses and top wage earners. He also opposes the death penalty and corporate involvement in campaign finance.
