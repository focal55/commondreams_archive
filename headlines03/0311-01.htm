<p>ISLAMABAD  - A grainy video purporting to show the  arrest of two al Qaeda leaders has done little to deflect  accusations that Pakistan may have staged this month's raid to  give it leeway to abstain in a U.N. vote on an Iraq war.
<p>

		On Monday, the powerful military Inter-Services  Intelligence (ISI) held an unprecedented news conference to  show foreign journalists what it said were images of a March 1  raid in Rawalpindi that netted al Qaeda kingpin Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed.<p>

		But few of journalists present were convinced the video --  which did not show Mohammed's face nor any sign of a struggle  -- was genuine. Many said it looked like a crude  reconstruction.<p>

		On Tuesday, a former ISI chief said he believed Mohammed  was actually arrested some time ago in a different city.<p>

		"They are trying to cover up," Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul  told Reuters. "I believe he was arrested before, probably in  Karachi."<p>

		One intelligence source said Mohammed had been arrested  three days before, from the Tench Batta suburb of Rawalpindi.<p>

		Rumors of Mohammed's arrest had circulated in Pakistan for  months, but were consistently denied.<p>

		Gul said news of the arrest appeared to have been leaked at  a critical time, just as Pakistan was facing huge U.S. pressure  to support a U.N. Security Council vote authorizing war on  Iraq.<p>

		On Monday night, a senior ruling party official told  Reuters the government, under massive domestic pressure to  oppose war on a fellow Muslim state, had decided to abstain in  the vote, news that shocked British and American diplomats in  Islamabad.<p>

		The ISI earlier said it had called its first news  conference in Pakistan's history to counter criticism in the  Western media that it had not done enough in the war on terror.<p>

		Gul said the raid may have been staged -- and news of the  arrest leaked -- for the same reason, against the backdrop of  the U.N. vote.<p>

		Gul, who ran the ISI from 1987 to 1989, said the raid was  conducted in far too casual a fashion to have been real, with  police failing to properly surround or secure the house in a  middle-class Rawalpindi suburb.<p>

		RELATIVES, NEIGHBORS CONTRADICT AUTHORITIES<p>

		Relatives of Ahmed Quddus, the son of the house owner, have  maintained he was the only man in the house at the time of the  raid. Neighbors said they heard no sound of gunfire --  contradicting the official account, which maintains that  Mohammed shot one intelligence agent in the foot with an AK-47  rifle.<p>

		Within hours, news of the raid and arrest was leaked to  foreign news agencies, something Gul also found incredible.<p>

		"He has to be questioned, before you present him to the  public eye," he said. "You don't present news like that."<p>

		In the video, an ISI officer is seen briefing half a dozen  agents about the impending raid -- in English, as opposed to  Pakistan's Urdu mother tongue.<p>

		Officials explained this was a reconstruction of the  original Urdu briefing, but said the rest of the video was  genuine.<p>

		But many journalists were unconvinced as a calm cameraman  shone his lights on the raiding party, and followed agents as  they casually broke into the compound and the house, and walked  up the stairs.<p>

		There was no sign of a struggle -- or of any urgency. The  cameramen then focused on the back and neck of the man  officials said was Mohammed, before the man was swiftly hooded.<p>

		The video has not been released to the media for broadcast.<p>

		Mohammed is identified by the United States as the  mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and  Washington. The ISI says the financier of the attacks, Saudi  national Ahmed al-Hawsawi, was also arrested in the same raid.<p>

		But one Pakistani source said al-Hawsawi had been picked up  at least one month before the announcement of his arrest, and  that intelligence agents had voiced delight at the time.<p>

		On Tuesday, Quddus was remanded in judicial custody for 14  days, and lawyers said his trial could start this month on  charges of possessing weapons, resisting arrest and terrorism.<p>

		The intelligence source said Quddus' family was suspected  of having sent Mohammed food, and Mohammed was said to have  visited the house four or five times.<p>

		Quddus is the son of an official in the Jamaat-e-Islami  party, a key member of a religious alliance that opposes the  military-backed government and has organized big street  protests against war on Iraq.<p>

		Authorities say at least two other al Qaeda suspects have  been arrested in houses linked to Jamaat-e-Islami members, but  Gul said the party could be the victim of an official campaign  to blacken their name.
		<p>

		"Jamaat has never had any contacts with the Arabs (al  Qaeda)," said Gul. "They are at loggerheads with U.S.  policy...and at this stage it would be an advantage to have  them labeled as terrorists."
