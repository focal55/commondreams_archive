<p>KABUL  - About 300 Afghans chanted anti-American and anti-British slogans in Kabul on Tuesday in the first such protest since U.S.-led forces toppled the fundamentalist Taliban in late 2001.

<p>The protesters, who included government employees and university students complained of growing insecurity, slow post-war reconstruction and delay in payment of state salaries by Hamid Karzai's U.S.-backed government.

</table></font>Some even called for the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition forces from Afghanistan and said the time had come for Afghans to fight the ``American invasion,'' just as they had resisted the British and the Soviets in the 20th Century.

<p>``We don't want the Brits and the Americans!'' shouted one of the protest leaders, a young and irate Kabul University student.

<p>``We want Islam to rule. We want security. They have failed to bring it to us and we want them out!''

<p>Another protester shouted: ``Death to (U.S. President George) Bush; Death to America!''

<p>The protest was a rare event in Kabul, where past demonstrations have usually been organized by the government. The ranks of the protesters were swelled by some passers by.

<p>The protest was organized by the ``Scientific Center'' headed by Sediq Afghan, a prominent Afghan philosopher known for outspoken criticisms of the communist regime of the 1980s, the Mujahideen governments that replaced it and also the Taliban.

<p>He vowed to continue peaceful demonstrations until ``the demands of people of Kabul'' were met. He said these included better security, improvements in the economy and progress in post-war reconstruction.
<p>``They are talking about reconstruction, but instead making themselves rich,'' he told the crowd.

<p>One of the protesters complained about the presence of ``Jews and Christians'' among U.S.-led coalition forces.

<p>``The time has come to beat the nail in the White House's coffin,'' he said. ``If we had dogs instead of these Jews and Christians, we would have security.''

<p>Afghan said that about the only changes people had noticed since the Taliban fell were that some women had stopped wearing coverall burqa garments and the introduction of the Internet.

<p>``Where is the security and reconstruction that they boasted about?'' he asked, pointing at pot holes in a downtown street.

<p>While a 4,500 strong international peacekeeping force has maintained security in Kabul since the Taliban fell, the United Nations and independent aid agencies are among those who complain about a lack of security in the provinces.

<p>President Hamid Karzai's government has struggled to assert its rule far outside Kabul and has itself repeatedly complained about slow disbursement of funds by donors for reconstruction.

<p>Much of the country remains under the control of warlords and their militias while Taliban remnants and their allies have stepped up attacks in the southern areas bordering Pakistan.
