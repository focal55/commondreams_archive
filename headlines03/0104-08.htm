<p>FORMER Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday launched a scathing attack on plans to attack Iraq.</p> <p>He warned that a military strike risked turning the Middle East into a &quot;inexhaustible recruiting ground for terrorism&quot; and would scupper hopes of a deal between Israel and the Palestinians.</p> <p>He was speaking as anti-war groups announced a day of mass protest on February 15.</p> <p>His attack will prove a huge embarrassment for No 10 which has relied on backing from senior Conservative right wingers who have supported taking a tough line with the Iraqi dictator.</p> <p>The peer, who was in charge of the Foreign Office for six years and oversaw policy during the Gulf War, said the context for conflict had changed since 1991 when &quot;a genuine international coalition, including the main Arab states, came together to free Kuwait&quot;.</p> <p>He added: &quot;Arab governments today are no fonder of Hussein than they were in 1991.</p> <p>&quot;But the overthrow of an Arab regime, however odious, by an Anglo-American military force would seem different in principle from the liberation of Kuwait.</p> <p>&quot;No friendly countries, Arab or other, would pick up the bill, as they willingly did in 1991.</p> <p>&quot;The greatest danger might not arise in fighting Hussein's forces - which could last only a few days - but in the aftermath in a region that would see itself unmistakably under the domination of the US, the protector of Israel.&quot; He said no attack was being mooted against the threat of North Korea because, &quot;Russia and China would oppose it and the consequences might be disastrous.&quot;</p> 
<p>He dismissed US claims that toppling Saddam could lead to more Arab democracy, saying: &quot;This strikes me as a breath-taking example of the human capacity for self-deception.&quot;</p> <p>Targeting senior US politicians such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell, he added: &quot;Elderly observers should beware of construing their past experience as a guide to the future.&quot; Lord Hurd joins a growing list of senior figures bitterly critical of war plans.</p> 
<p>Lib Dem foreign affairs spokes-man Menzies Campbell said: &quot;Douglas Hurd makes public anxieties felt by virtually everyone with a knowledge of the Middle East and an understanding of the Arab world.</p> <p>&quot;Margaret Thatcher in the Falklands, John Major in the Gulf and Tony Blair in Kosovo could rely on overwhelming Parliamentary and public support for military action. There is a notable absence of both in relation to Iraq.&quot;</p> <p>The Archbishop of York warned that war would inevitably lead to crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Dr David Hope distributed a prayer letter calling on Britain and the US to remember the &quot;scale of human suffering that war brings&quot; and the &quot;right of Iraqi people to determine their own future.&quot;</p> <p>His spokesman said strong emotions had been raised, &quot;because of the absence of any justification for war on Iraq.&quot; He added: &quot;These prayers urge the government to think very carefully about the consequences.&quot;</p> <p>A No 10 official said: &quot;Everybody is entitled to express their opinion, including religious leaders.&quot;</p> <p>Tony Blair has been careful to avoid a public row with the Church but behind the scenes is thought to be furious at what ministers sees as its &quot;meddling&quot; in politics.</p> <p>BRITISH ambassadors are being called to London next week to discuss how they can react quickly to terror strikes and take &quot;mobile embassies&quot; to trouble spots.</p>
