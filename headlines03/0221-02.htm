Thirteen-year-old Arthur Niven often spends his weekends engaged in 
elaborate historical role-playing games on the computer, but last Sunday he 
decided to forgo the virtual for the reality of participating in the peace 
march in San Francisco.
<P>It was the Point Arena teenager's first foray into a modern political 
demonstration, an adventure mixed with the real thrill that his actions "might 
affect other things in the near future.
<P>"I definitely had the sense that this was a historical event," he said.
<P>Youths like Niven are becoming increasingly involved in the peace movement 
against the potential war with Iraq, according to student organizers and 
activists who have watched their ranks grow exponentially at demonstrations.
<P>They are also mounting their own anti-war movement on campuses by passing 
out leaflets, having rallies and staging events.
<P>Today, many students are planning to leave classes after about 11 a.m. and 
picket the military recruiting office behind the Stonestown mall in San 
Francisco during lunch hour. Another contingent is planning to do the same at 
the campus Military Affairs office near UC Berkeley.
<P>Both events are part of the nationally coordinated "days of non-compliance" 
organized by the student and youth contingent of International ANSWER, one of 
several organizations that sponsored last weekend's march. More class walkouts 
and demonstrations are being planned on March 5.
<P>Tahnee Nye, an organizer with ANSWER (the acronym stands for Act Now to 
Stop War and End Racism) in San Francisco said local chapters of the anti-war 
group, which is based in Washington, D.C., had been speaking at teach-ins at 
area schools every day for the last several weeks.
<P>AiMara Lin, a student and youth organizer for the anti-war group Not In Our 
Name, said the group had been inundated with requests to make presentations.
<P>While statistics on the percentage of teens involved in the peace movement 
were not readily available, student organizers say recent increases appear to 
be dramatic.
<P>"Just compared with the last couple rallies, I can tell the number is 
growing because I'd say I saw twice as many (teenagers) this last time," said 
Jesse Cottrell, who sits on the San Francisco Youth Commission.
<P>"A lot of them had rally banners that weren't your typical flower-power 
kind of thing; more were graffiti-oriented, which is appealing to a lot of 
youth," he said.
<P>Besides presenting anti-war slogans, Cottrell, said, the signs also 
delivered the message that "this is not your parents' peace movement."
<P>Berkeley High School senior Lauren Wingate said that she believed the 
gravity of a potential war resonated deeply for her and her peers.
<P>"My generation will be most affected by (the war), especially if they 
implement the draft again -- a lot of my peers will be affected," said Wingate,
<P>who is 18 and leads a campus group called Youth Together. "Anything I can say 
to hopefully stop that from happening I definitely need to say."
<P>And there's a group dynamic involved too, she said.
<P>"I definitely see a trend to be more conscious of what's going on 
(politically)," Wingate said. "It's cool to want to be revolutionary, to be a 
rebel."
<P>Colin Wade, a 17-year-old junior at Galileo High School, said there was a 
socially appealing aspect to the anti-war events.
<P>"It's just a great place to go, there's lots of positive energy, and it's a 
really cool place to meet people and hang out have a good time," he said. 
"It's a big social thing."
<P>Even elementary school-age children are getting into the action.
<P>Carey Davis, the director of the Presidio Hill School, said about 40 
students marched in each of the last two demonstrations.
<P>"In many cases it's the kids leading the parents, saying 'I need a ride, I 
need to go to the march,' " she mused. "All these parents who thought their 
marching days are over are getting pulled back in."
