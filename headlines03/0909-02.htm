<p>WASHINGTON  - The biggest American farmers  received 71 percent of U.S. farm subsidies since 1995,  environmentalists said on Tuesday in a report that could fuel  the fight in Congress for tighter limits on farm supports.<P>

</table>Activists say mammoth payments to large operators gives  them the cash to out-bid their smaller neighbors for land and  equipment. The result is higher operating costs, they say, but  no improvement in farm income.<P>
According to the Environmental Working Group, the top 10  percent of U.S. growers collected an average $278,932 a year.  Their share of payments steadily grew from 1995, when the elite  group of farmers got 55 percent of government payments.<P>
Billions of dollars are funneled to American grain, cotton  and soybean growers each year. Farmers and ranchers also  receive federal money to idle environmentally sensitive land or  to control manure run-off from fields and feedlots.<P>
"The ability of the family farmer to survive and make a  living is plummeting," said Chuck Hassebrook of the Center for  Rural Affairs in Walthill, Nebraska. "Farm programs are doing  as much to subsidize large farmers as to drive smaller farmers  out of business."<P>
Iowa Republican Charles Grassley planned to ask for a  Senate vote in coming weeks for a "hard" cap on farm subsidies,  now set at $360,000 a year but easily circumvented. An aide  said Grassley wanted a limit in the range of $275,000-$300,000  that would end ways to exceed the limit.<P>
"It's not surprising to me that concentration is  increasing," Grassley told Reuters. "Hopefully this information  will prove it's time to act and enact legitimate, reasonable  payment limits."<P>
The Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based  activist organization, released its report as the World Trade  Organization was meeting in Mexico to discuss how to cut farm  subsidies in rich nations, which spend a combined $300 billion  annually on their growers.<P>
The United States maintains its farm subsidies of about  $18.7 billion this fiscal year fall within the WTO rules.<P>
The Environmental Working Group study showed that 71  percent of payments went to the biggest farmers --  far higher  than the belief among agricultural experts that large farmers  received about two-thirds of the money. Large operators often  control thousands of acres and account for a large part of crop  and livestock output.<P>
Environmental Working Group said the higher figure became  apparent when it totaled payments for the eight years at $114  billion and divided for the 2.8 million recipients.<P>
"Payments are more concentrated over the eight-year period  than for individual years because the largest recipients tend  to receive payments every year," it said in its report.<P>
Riceland Foods Inc., a 9,000-member cooperative in  Arkansas, was the largest subsidy recipient in 2002 with $110  million.<P>
The subsidy list indirectly included Bernard Ebbers, the  former chief executive of telephone company WorldCom, which  filed the largest bankruptcy case in history last year. Ebbers  was part-owner of Joshua Timber Co. LLC, which got $44,761  since 1995, mostly for land conservation. Ebbers was not shown  as receiving money directly.<P>
"We're not suggesting big is bad," said Ken Cook, head of  Environmental Working Group. He argues that land stewardship  programs should get 25 percent of farm subsidy money -- a much  larger share than now allotted. Stewardship money is spread far  more evenly than crop subsidies, he said, and is available to  all farmers, not just those growing wheat, corn, barley,  cotton, rice and oilseeds such as soybeans.<P>
Environmental Working Group said it would make its figures,  based on U.S. Agriculture Department records, available on the  Internet at <a href="http://www.ewg.org/farm2/home.php" target="_new">http://www.ewg.org/farm2/home.php</a>
