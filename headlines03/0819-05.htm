<p>LOS ANGELES, Aug. 16 — Arianna Huffington was insisting recently that the handful of viable candidates in the California recall race should debate, when she was asked whether she saw Gary Coleman, the actor, as credible.

<p>Ms. Huffington told her interviewer on CNN in a sultry Greek accent that sounded like Zsa Zsa Gabor, "I will hold Gary Coleman on my lap during the debate." 

<p>It was a classic moment in the campaign of the columnist-turned-candidate-for-governor. She does know how to win attention in a 135-candidate contest. But to do so, the candidate, who says she has a serious platform, sometimes acts like many of the less-than-serious actors in the recall comedy-drama.

<p>Beyond acknowledging her knack for publicity, no one ever seems to know quite what to make of Ms. Huffington, who addresses her many high-powered friends as "dahling" and who, with a master's from Cambridge, is as lucid on Keynes as she is on Armani.

<p>Even her friends describe her as something of a contradiction. She has reinvented herself countless times over the last 10 years, taking a journey from outspoken Republican Washington hostess and fast friend of Newt Gingrich to darling of the liberal West Los Angeles glitterati-literati to populist candidate. She is considered by those who know her well to be one of the most intellectually curious people they have met.

<p>She has made regulating the automobile industry and a crusade against sport utility vehicles her causes in recent years. Meanwhile, her former husband, Michael Huffington, a former Republican congressman who has not been shy about criticizing her since she started her campaign, has pointed out that the couple always had two or three S.U.V.'s in their garages. 

<p>She rails against lobbyists. Yet it has turned out that her campaign manager, Dean Barkley, who helped Jesse Ventura make the journey from wrestler to independent governor of Minnesota, has been a lobbyist for tobacco companies in Minnesota.

<p>Mr. Barkley said he had told an intermediary about his lobbying before he joined the campaign, but not Ms. Huffington. 

<p>She is running against tax loopholes and corporate tax dodgers but has had to explain why she has paid virtually nothing in federal income taxes in the last few years. She said she had far more expenses than income in 2001 and 2002. 

<p>After a confrontational back-and-forth with a television reporter over an article in The Los Angeles Times that reported how she wrote off huge deductions and paid $771 in federal taxes over the last two years, Ms. Huffington said to the reporter, "Honey, I think you're confused." After the news conference, Ms. Huffington looked deep into the reporter's eyes and asked, "Why are you doing this, this gotcha politics?"

<p>"Come on," she said to the reporter later, "we've got two months. It's going to be fun."

<p>Certainly she has been making a race that is already a spectacle into an even more unpredictable show with her unerring instinct for publicity.

<p>It is a thirst for the public eye that some say can cross a line into self-parody, as when she burst into the news media stakeout of Arnold Schwarzenegger last week, knocking over his microphone and then appearing in the photograph along with the actor and his wife, Maria Shriver. 

<p>"All I thought when I saw her on Saturday barging into the photo-op was, `This is Arianna the hostess, and it's her party,"' said Harry Shearer, the actor and host of the weekly radio program "Le Show" who is close to Ms. Huffington. "That's the Arianna I know — total panache in a situation where she's knocking over Arnie's microphone."

<p>Many Republicans and Democrats alike roll their eyes and describe her as a political opportunist.

<p>"She's a parody, and that's why she gets a lot of attention," said Edward J. Rollins, who ran Mr. Huffington's 1994 campaign. "She'll do or say anything like getting into the Schwarzenegger picture."

<p>Ms. Huffington first appeared on the national political scene in the early 90's as the high-profile wife of Mr. Huffington, a multimillionaire Senate candidate who poured nearly $30 million into his race.

<p>The couple were divorced in 1997 after 11 years of marriage, and he came out publicly as bisexual in 1998. By the time the Huffingtons were divorced, she had established herself as a columnist and an author, chronicling her shift from right to left in her writing. 

<p>Initially, she was an admirer of Mr. Gingrich and his Republican revolution. She abruptly gave up a cozy relationship with Mr. Gingrich after she wrote a critical column about him in 1996. Now she has moved so thoroughly across the spectrum that it was leftist advocates and pundits who urged her to run for governor.

<p>She describes her shift as an evolution "based on the evidence." In an interview at her $7 million house in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles, where she has an office filled with books and photographs of her 12- and 14-year-old daughters, she took issue with the many people who say she is constantly reinventing herself. 

<p>"I wouldn't use the word `reinvention,' " she said. "I was an Arnold Schwarzenegger Republican, a moderate on issues like gay rights, choice, gun control. I never deviated on those issues. My transformation had to do with my perception of the role of government. I was a Republican when I believed that the private sector would step up to the plate and solve a lot of the social problems we're facing."

<p>But it did not, she said.

<p>"I'm very proud," she added, "that I changed my mind when I was confronted with new evidence. I wish more people would do that. I wish the president and the Republican Congress would change their minds about tax cuts, confronted with evidence of ongoing job losses following the multibillion-dollar tax cuts."

<p>She says she is running for governor to "break the hold of special interests in California." 

<p>"Reorder policy priorities and take back the state," she added. "And the only way to do that is to be governor."

<p>In interviews, in her books and on the campaign trail, she often quotes the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., although lately she is more likely to talk about Mr. Schwarzenegger, calling him a "Bush Republican" and a "photo-op candidate," adding with a dash of condescension, "He is where I was 10 years ago."

<p>She has been trying to fend off questions about her campaign. Of Mr. Barkley's lobbying, she says she would have let him go if he had been a lobbyist in California. 

<p>Her nine books — a 10th is in the works — include a book about women and feminism, a Picasso biography and a recent best-seller, "Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America" (Crown).

<p>During the campaign, she will not write her syndicated column or appear on the weekly radio program "Left, Right and Center," which is produced and distributed by KCRW-FM at Santa Monica College, a junior college, to public radio stations. When Ms. Huffington joined the program in 1996, she was the voice of the right. Now, she is what the program describes as "the fourth dimension in political thinking, or floating above the usual political labels."

<p>Robert Scheer, a columnist for The Los Angles Times who is the voice of the left on "Left, Right and Center," said: "There isn't anything Arianna can't figure out when she puts her mind to it. This is not some flighty person at all."

<p>One of the harshest critics of her metamorphosis is Mr. Huffington, who has endorsed Mr. Schwarzenegger for governor. 

<p>"She's a chameleon," said Mr. Huffington, who narrowly lost his Senate race to Dianne Feinstein in 1994 after the news that the Huffingtons had hired an illegal immigrant to care for their children even though Mr. Huffington supported a ballot proposition focused on illegal immigrants. 

<p>Mr. Huffington briefly considered running in the recall, leading to speculation in Internet chat rooms about a Huffington v. Huffington spectacle. But he said he decided not to run for the sake of his two daughters, who, he said, urged both parents not to run. 

<p>After Ms. Huffington stated in interviews her opposition to Proposition 187, a ballot measure that bars immigrants from receiving state services and that Mr. Schwarzenegger supported, Mr. Huffington went out of his way, calling a reporter two times after an interview, to say she had encouraged him to support the measure in his campaign. 

<p>Ms. Huffington said although her husband supported Proposition 187, she voted against it. 

<p>Mr. Huffington described his former wife's long association with a new age guru here, John-Roger, leader of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, as her Achilles' heel and called him her closest adviser.

<p>"He has more influence on her than anyone else in the world," Mr. Huffington said. "His religion is a religion of opportunity."

<p>The connection to John-Roger dogged Mr. Huffington's campaign in 1994, according to him and Mr. Rollins, but it has not become much of an issue in hers now.

<p>In an e-mail message, John-Roger said: "If you know Arianna, you know that she is a highly independent thinker. I would be surprised if I have had any influence at all on her political philosophy. "

<p>Ms. Huffington said: "I've gotten a lot of value from John-Roger's work. He's a good friend."

<p>But, she added, "My spiritual life has absolutely no place in this campaign."

<p>Ms. Huffington said she would not respond to her former husband's other criticisms, adding: 

<p>"He will obviously say a lot of things. And if it were anybody else saying these things other than the father of my children, I would respond." 

<p>Strategists watching the race say they doubt that she could pull off a victory. She is far from the top of the polls.

<p>In a typically unorthodox move, Ms. Huffington said that she would campaign at times with Peter Camejo, the Green Party candidate backed by Ralph Nader, and that toward the end of the two-month campaign, the two would decide who had a better chance of winning. Then each would support the candidate more likely to draw the most votes. 

<p>Given the realities of what her campaign team calls the "Arnold factor," there is not much chance of her upstaging Mr. Schwarzenegger. 

<p>But it is clear one week into the campaign that Ms. Huffington and her handlers have determined that the best way for her to make a splash is to say something, anything, about Mr. Schwarzenegger and dog him at every turn.

<p>"In 10 years," Ms. Huffington said, "when he's had his own transformation about the role of government, I think he could have the beginnings of making a good governor."
