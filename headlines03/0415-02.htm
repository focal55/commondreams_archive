<p>PESHAWAR  - Protesting against the U.S-led attack on Iraq, wide sections of society in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP) have banned American multinationals Coke and Pepsi, amongst others, spawning a slew of new, local soft drinks.

  <p>
 


Soon after the attack, Pakistan's <i> ulemas </i> (religious leaders) launched a campaign against foreign products, particularly beverages, appealing to the faithful in their Friday sermons, to stop using products made by American, British and Jewish-run companies.
 <p>

</table></font>Their speeches inflamed the passions of the Pakistani public outraged by the bombing of Iraq, striking a chord even among liberals in Pakistani society.
 <p>
 


During the U.S. attack on Afghanistan last year, the leaders had issued similar appeals to the public, but failed to get an encouraging response.
 <p>
 


But this time they hit pay dirt. Large numbers of Muslims especially those in the NWFP believed America would launch similar attacks on other Muslim countries.
 <p>
 


The ulemas came armed with a list of products and names of fast-food chains that should not be patronized by Pakistanis because they claimed the revenue thus generated would ultimately be used against Muslims in Iraq and Palestine.
 <p>
 


So Pakistanis scratched Pepsi, Coke, Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Caltex, Mobil and others from their shopping lists.
 <p>
 


The idea of boycotting U.S. products was floated in the Pakistani Senate (upper house of Parliament) last month.
 <p>
 


Initially, it was a purely political ploy for the ruling right-wing Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and its supporters.
 <p>
 


But the concept proved contagious, with traders, lawyers, teachers and other organizations, in no way aligned with the religious right represented by the MMA, deciding to follow suit.
 <p>
 


Last week, even the high court bar association of Peshawar, NWFP's capital, banned the sale of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the court cafeteria.
 <p>
 


The association issued directives to the cafeteria contractor to refrain from selling Pepsi Cola, Coca-Cola and other beverages produced by the two American multinationals.
 <p>
 


Alleging that the profits earned by these companies were used to target Muslims, the bar association's general body meeting decided to boycott products made by U.S. and British companies.
 <p>
 


The NWFP chapter of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association urged teachers to avoid the use of American and "Jewish" products.
 <p>
 


President of the Peshawar University Teachers Association (PUTA) Arbab Khan Afridi, said, "Pepsi was my favorite cold drink but this year I did not have it even once."
 <p>
 


Afridi said PUTA had banned the use of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in their meetings and functions to register their protest against the "atrocities against Muslims" around the world.
 <p>
 


"We have made a formal request to the stores and cafeteria owners on the campus to stop the sale of these beverages and now we have planned to issue a formal notification in this respect," he said.

<p>
 


On April 8, traders throughout Pakistan observed a complete strike to condemn the U.S. aggression against Iraq.
<p>



"We have appealed to businessmen and consumers to boycott foreign products, particularly soft drinks, and the people's response was very positive," said a leader of the trading community in Peshawar, Sharafat Ali Mubarak.
<p>



While the boycott might be bad news for multinationals, their local competitors never had it so good. Riding on the anti-American wave were local companies eager to fill the void.
<p>



Several small local beverage companies scrambled to get a toehold in the multi-billion dollar market in Pakistan, particularly the NWFP.
<p>



Among the home-grown heroes was the soft drink Salsabeel. After the Iraq war started, the company distributed publicity leaflets to people streaming out of mosques after Friday prayers.
<p>



Salsabeel claimed it was a substitute for Coca-Cola and Pepsi and appealed to Muslims to buy the local drink and economically destroy the U.S. and its allies - Britain and the Jews.
<p>



The people, particularly students in the University of Peshawar, welcomed the appeal and Salsabeel did brisk business there.
<p>



The manager of a university cafeteria, Sultan Zeb, said most of the students asked for Salsabeel instead of Pepsi or Coke.
<p>



"As the summer advanced, one would imagine that Pepsi sales would increase but, in fact, it dropped up to 40 percent after the students started the boycott," he said.
<p>



Department of economics student Ismail Khan said students had decided to boycott multinational beverages because the country was losing foreign exchange.
<p>



"We can easily avoid buying many foreign products and we will use their alternatives to render these multinationals economically weak," he added.
<p>



Soda was another local soft drink which had begun raking in profits. Pitched as an alternative to the American colas, it was a hit not only in Peshawar but in other parts of NWFP as well.
<p>



Apart from the anti-American sentiment, a key factor working in favor of the local soft drinks was their low price - half of Pepsi and Coke.
<p>



The manager of the Salsabeel beverage company, Muhammad Tariq, said the drink was launched after the leaders requested the company to provide people with a local option.
<p>



"We started production on a limited scale because we do not have large-scale machinery like the multinationals but the people's response was encouraging," he claimed.
<p>



Tariq boasted that, "Our sales increased by 50 percent this year as compared to the previous year."
<p>



Mubarak said sales of foreign soft drink companies had nosedived. He said multinationals were planning to slash prices, announcing discount schemes to lure businessmen.
<p>



But Pepsi officials denied the boycott had eroded their market share. A supervisor at Pepsi Cola, Asad Khan, said though some traders and individuals had voiced protests, Pepsi sales remained unaffected.
<p>



Khan claimed Salsabeel and Soda would not be able to meet growing demand. Consequently, consumers would return to cold drinks manufactured by the multinationals.
<p>



"The local beverages are being manufactured manually or by small-scale machinery so their quality is poor, and they cannot compete with us," he asserted.</p>
