 <p>The endgame has begun -- not only with Iraq, but with America's 
friends.
<P>By escalating his threats against Baghdad, and insisting he is unwilling to 
participate in "the rerun of a bad movie," President Bush is serving notice on 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the time for prevarication is over. More 
immediately, he is signaling U.S. allies that he is prepared to go to war with 
Iraq without their approval.
<P>The increasingly bellicose White House rhetoric puts the Bush 
administration sharply at odds with many of its European allies, particularly 
France, which has threatened to veto a second United Nations Security Council 
resolution authorizing a war with Iraq over its weapons of mass destruction. 
Even British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bush's most loyal supporter, has 
called for U.N. weapons inspectors to be given the "time and space" to 
complete their work.
<P>There remains a possibility that a "smoking gun" will emerge that will 
persuade the French and other allies of the case for early military action. 
For now, however, the United States faces the prospect of fighting a major war 
with little international support. Less than three months after winning a 
unanimous Security Council vote that gave Hussein one "last chance" to 
surrender his nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the United States and 
Britain find themselves diplomatically isolated.
<P>The White House hope is that a spirited show of U.S. determination will 
persuade reluctant allies to fall into line, rather than miss a chance to 
shape the future of the Middle East.
<P>There is, however, a difference between the last time around and this time, 
according to foreign policy analyst Ivo Daalder of the Brookings Institution.
<P>Although the Security Council's Nov. 8 vote demanding that Iraq cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors was unanimous, it masked deep divisions among its 
members over the threshold for military action against Iraq and the length of 
time inspections should be allowed to continue before declaring Baghdad to be 
in "material breach" of its obligations. As war gets closer, these divisions 
have burst into the open.
<P>Bush and his advisers are determined to avoid a repeat of the cat-and-mouse 
game that Iraq played with U.N. inspectors during the 1990s, when it dribbled 
out information about its weapons programs only under extreme duress. "Surely 
our friends have learned lessons from the past," Bush said, referring to 
French claims that Iraq is cooperating with the inspectors.
<P>But French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin upped the challenge to 
Washington on Tuesday by saying Paris plans to lobby other European nations to 
oppose early military action in Iraq.
<P>"It is important that Europe speak on this issue with a single voice," de 
Villepin said after talks with his Belgian counterpart. "We are mobilized; we 
believe war can be avoided."
<P>Several European diplomats said they believe there is still "wiggle room" 
for France to reach agreement with the United States on the need for military 
action against Iraq, if presented with convincing evidence of clandestine 
Iraqi arms programs.
<P>They noted that de Villepin used phrases such as "nothing today justifies a 
recourse to military action," implying that conditions could change tomorrow.
<P>A refusal by France to endorse U.S. war plans would be a diplomatic 
embarrassment for the Bush administration, but probably not a fatal obstacle, 
analysts said. Turkey seems likely to agree to host as many as 15,000 U.S. 
troops, much lower than the original administration request, but enough to 
open a northern front. Kuwait, Qatar and Oman probably will cooperate, and 
Saudi Arabia will provide logistical support, while maintaining a public 
distance from Washington.
<P>On Tuesday, the Pentagon ordered the deployment of two more Navy aircraft 
carrier battle groups, whose arrival in the Persian Gulf region will double 
the number of carriers deployed to within striking distance of Iraq.
<P>The carrier movements came on the heels of a new Pentagon deployment of 
another 37,000 troops, including elements of the Texas-based 4th Infantry 
Division. It is the Army's most modernized infantry division, equipped with 
the military's most sophisticated command and control and communications 
systems.
