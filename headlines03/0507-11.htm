<p>The pounding rain soaked the large peace sign hanging on the front of Phil 
Meymand's and Alice Cannan's Oakland house, tearing off one hand-drawn letter 
at a time.
<P>When the rain stopped, all that was left was a smeared, soggy remnant.
<P>It was a symbolic moment for the couple and their 4- and 6-year-old 
daughters, who had marched together at numerous anti-war rallies in the Bay 
Area and in the state capital only to see their hopes for a peaceful solution 
in Iraq crushed under a wave of war.

</table></font>Like a hard rain, the swamping of Saddam Hussein's army has washed away 
peace signs all over the Bay Area and left the anti-war movement in tatters.
<P>But to Meymand and Cannan, the end of the war is just the beginning of the 
battle against what they see as a growing conviction in America that it's all 
right to invade a country that you think needs a new government.
<P>"Sure, peace signs are coming down, but I don't think it's a lost cause," 
said Meymand, a 41-year-old engineer. "Now more than ever it is important to 
work for peace. One thing we've learned from this is that by the time polices 
are set in motion, it is tremendously difficult to change their course. If 
people think they can go out and march a few weekends and change America's 
course, they are mistaken. It is a long-term process."
<P>That means Meymand and Cannan will continue questioning what they see as a 
national policy of spending billions bombing a country and then billions more 
rebuilding what was destroyed.
<P>"My question is, why not skip the bombing and killing part and go directly 
to the aid part," Meymand said. "The only thing our government has proven so 
far is that the military can pound the hell out of anybody."
<P>And, he said, if Americans aren't careful, our military may soon be trying 
to pound countries like North Korea, Iran and Syria.
<P>"Our government has designs to transform the Middle East, to influence the 
political landscape of all the countries in that region," Meymand said. "I 
think the war in Iraq is really the first battle in that foreign policy goal."
<P>Meymand and Cannan have been stung by criticism of the anti-war movement, 
especially since they believe the ramifications of the war in Iraq could last 
for years.
<P>If America's quick victory in Iraq means protesters were wrong, they ask, 
would a devastating terrorist attack in a month or a year mean the war was 
wrong?
<P>"We don't know what would have happened if we didn't invade Iraq," said 
Cannan, 39, a women's health practitioner. "Who's to say what outcome is 
better when you can't test one against the other? Right now, people are still 
being fired upon. There is anti-American feeling. The big question is, does 
the end justify the means?"
<P>And there may be no end in sight, according to Meymand. He said the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict continues to rage while anti-American sentiment in Arab 
and Muslim countries grows. Meanwhile, he said, the United Nations is divided, 
and many of America's traditional European allies have turned against Bush 
administration policies.
<P>But Meymand and Cannan also believe this is "a crossroads" in history for 
the Middle East, if not the entire world.
<P>"All these countries in the Middle East are poised at a moment of 
opportunity now with the new Palestinian prime minister," Meymand said. "The U.
S. has an opportunity to boldly support a truly equitable agreement. But if 
they stay with this idea of unilateral threat -- it's our way or the highway -- it won't be successful."
<P>This is why Meymand and Cannan believe it is important to continue to 
actively oppose the Bush administration.
<P>Ultimately, what they are most concerned about are the lessons their 
children learn. Cannan said it is difficult teaching children to use words to 
solve conflicts when their government is doing the exact opposite.
<P>But she hopes that taking them to the demonstrations at least taught them 
it is all right to speak out when they see injustice.
<P>In many ways, it was a lesson the parents learned. Both are now more 
involved in local issues, and Cannan has recently become immersed in the 
politically charged issue of improving Oakland schools.
<P>"Our objective in marching against the war wasn't to stop it," Meymand said.
<P>"It was to voice our objection to it. It shows the world that not all 
Americans are of the cowboy mentality. So protesting is never futile. It's 
part of a long-term process of working for peace and justice."
<P>For the children, it's all about contrasts.
<P>"Do you know what the opposite of war is?" asked 4-year-old Leila one 
recent day as the last of the Iraqi forces were being driven out of Baghdad.
<P>"Peace," said Cannan.
<P>"And the opposite of peace, is war," said a smiling Leila, grasping for 
perhaps the first time what all the recent fuss was about.</p>
