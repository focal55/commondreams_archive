<p>BEIJING --
Ask Beijing residents what they will do Sept. 11, and they beam and 
tell you about moon cakes, the round pastries they make to mark the Moon 
Festival, which falls on that day this year.
<P>Memories of another time that have inscribed the date indelibly in the 
minds of millions are faint, but slowly they emerge, and when they do, the 
recollections are not only of shock and dismay but also of the jubilant 
celebrations that greeted news of the terrorist attacks on U.S. targets.
<P>"It was night, most people were going to sleep -- but as the news spread, 
people came out to dance and cheer," says Janice Wu, 28, a hotel manager. 
"They were screaming and lighting firecrackers -- it was like a big party."
<P>The isolated celebrations were quickly discouraged by China's embarrassed 
government, but even now, two years later, the anniversary of the attacks 
reminds some people more of America's reputed sins against China and the world 
than of the loss of more than 3,000 innocent lives.
<P>"America is a bully, so when someone small hits them back, it feels good," 
says Huai Lei, 21, a student at the Beijing Institute of Science.
<P>For some Chinese like Lei,  9/11 was payback for what they see as America's 
arrogance and its perceived attempts to short-circuit China's emergence as a 
major player on the world stage.
<P>"America wants to be the boss of the world. For this, it will do anything. 
It attacked our embassy in Yugoslavia for no reason," says Lei, referring to 
the 1999 Kosovo war bombing, which the United States said was a mistake. 
"Sometimes I even wonder if 9/11 was created to give Bush a reason to go after 
the Taliban and Iraq."
<P>In the wake of the terrorist attacks, former President Jiang Zemin 
expressed his condolences and pledged his nation's cooperation "in combatting 
all manner of terrorist violence," and both Beijing and Washington have worked 
to mend a relationship strained by disagreements over U.S. policy in the 
former Yugoslavia and China's human rights record.
<P>But Jiang consistently rejected Bush's "axis of evil" rhetoric. In April 
2002, he even paid a state visit to Iran, and his nation continues to maintain 
strong ties with Iran and North Korea, as well as Sudan and Libya.
<P>Meanwhile, China's state-controlled media frequently criticize "American 
hegemony," and argue that a "multipolar" world is necessary to offset U.S. 
military and economic dominance.
<P>"International stability is very important for China," says Shi Yinghong, 
professor of American Diplomacy and head of the Center of International 
Studies at People's University in Beijing. He says people in China are worried 
about how America's reactions to 9/11 have "aggravated, not mitigated," the 
global security situation.
<P>"This is a big concern," he says. "The United States could show more 
flexibility and acknowledge the concerns of other countries. If it doesn't, 
there will be some tension."
<P>Not all Chinese joined in the criticism of U.S. policies.
<P>Liu Zheng, a retired civil servant, shakes his head sadly at the mention of 
the celebrations two years ago. "Young people are passionate," he says. "For 
me personally, the toll of the innocent is sometimes almost too much to think 
about."
<P>Although Lei and other young Chinese admit that tragedies in Washington and 
New York were "sad," for them the loss of individual life is not the key issue.
<P>"I don't even believe that the death of all those people was the thing that 
hurt America the most," says Pin Kiang, another student Beijing Institute of 
Science student. "It was their ego that got hurt. That's why they hit out at 
Iraq -- to show that no one can challenge America. But how many people have 
they killed there?"
<P>As the students speak, they seem oblivious to the symbols of the United 
States that loom behind them.
<P>American investment and consumers have fueled much of the extraordinary 
economic growth in which China takes such pride. A giant McDonald's and rows 
of shops hawking Motorola cell phones, Nike shoes and MTV fashions are what 
draw Lei and his friends to Beijing's chic Wangfujiang Avenue. But these 
weapons of America's "soft power" -- its culture and lifestyle -- haven't 
produced a young generation of Chinese infatuated with America.
<P>Instead, they separate American culture from its politics, which may 
explain why the same Chinese who speak so critically of America line up 
outside its embassy in Beijing to seek visas.
<P>"If you look inside America, life is good -- people are free, there is law -
- but outside, America wants no law," says Kiang, citing U.S. opposition to 
the Kyoto accords on global warming and the International Criminal Court. "It 
wants absolute control over everything, everybody, even the U.N."
<P>Watching the twin towers in New York crumble horrified many Chinese. But in 
hearts practiced at coping with far greater tragedy -- like the loss of about 
30 million lives from famine after Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward -- the 
distant loss of thousands of lives now seems almost forgotten. What remains is 
skepticism about America's policies.  </p>
