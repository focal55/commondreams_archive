 <p>CARACAS - Nobel Peace laureate Jimmy Carter presented two options Tuesday to the Venezuelan government and opposition to resolve the country's long political deadlock: agree to shorten President Hugo Chávez's term or hold a referendum on revoking his mandate.

<p>
Shortening the presidential term would require a constitutional reform and the revocatory referendum could not be held until August, the halfway point in the six-year term, according to the Venezuelan constitution.
<p>
 


Carter, a former U.S. president and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize 2002, says that either of the options should mean the end of the seven-week-old strike that the opposition is staging in a bid to force Chávez from power.
<p>
 


These are two alternative proposals, independent of each other, he explained.
<p>
 


''We're pleased with the reception we had from both the government and the opposition,'' Carter told a press conference after meeting the leaders from both sides of Venezuela's polarized political arena.
<p>
 


''I am in favor of opening new routes. I have said many times that if the people revoke my mandate, I'll leave. And if they decide on an amendment to shorten the constitutional term, I'll accept it,'' Chávez said after meeting with Carter.
<p>
 


The Democratic Coordinator, which unites the opposition forces of political parties, business associations, trade unions and civil society groups, has yet to issue a statement on Carter's proposals.
<p>
 


Recent days have seen several clashes between pro-Chávez and opposition demonstrators. A confrontation Monday escalated with stone throwing and gunshots in Valles del Tuy, a residential community neighboring Caracas, leaving one person dead and 25 injured.
<p>
 


The Carter Center, directed by the former U.S. president, is a member of the tripartite group mediating talks between the government and the opposition, as are the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Organization of American States (OAS).
 <p>
 


The group guides the work of the negotiating panel that is presided by OAS secretary-general César Gaviria.
 <p>
 


Carter announced that he would soon present ''specific proposals'' that take into account the demands of each side, and that he will also take the alternatives before the newly created ''Friends of Venezuela'', a group that is slated to gather Friday in Washington.
 <p>
 


The Group of Friends, founded at the urging of Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, consists of Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United States. The foreign ministers from these countries will meet Friday at the OAS headquarters.
 <p>
 


Carter said the government and opposition negotiators could discuss a specific timeline for either of the formulas, if they accept either, which would imply an end to the strike so that the country can prepare for a vote.
 <p>
 


He said there would be no ''tricks'' because the international community -- through the Friends -- would work with the negotiators to ensure that the results are heeded.
 <p>
 


The strike, which began Dec 2, has mostly paralyzed the country, in large part because the employees of the state-run oil giant, Petróleos de Venezuela, have supported the work stoppage and closed down oil wells and refineries, and have halted shipments of the crude and its derivatives.
 <p>
 


Gasoline and natural gas are scarce, as are other basic goods like milk, flour, soap and paper, and high demand items such as beer and soft drinks.
 <p>
 


In the short term, the effects of the strike could push hundreds of businesses into bankruptcy, leaving thousands of people without work.
 <p>
 


''No one imagined that the strike, which is destroying the country's economy and social structure, would last 50 days, and no one wants it to last 70 or 100 days,'' Carter commented.
<p>



Carter's proposed options for ending the crisis are covered by the Venezuelan constitution, which entered into force in December 1999, approved in a referendum by the electorate.
<p>



So far, the government has challenged the opposition to seek a revocatory referendum, considering the number of signatures required for the measure to be far out of reach.
<p>



But the opposition did gather 1.5 million signatures, many more than the minimum required to hold a different type of referendum, a ''consultative'' vote, also outlined in the constitution.
<p>



The consultative referendum sought by the opposition would ask the voters if they think the president should immediately resign. The results of this vote would not be legally binding.
<p>




The seven-week strike began, planned to last only two days, in support of the referendum initiative.
<p>



In the case that a constitutional amendment is chosen as a way out of the crisis, the government holds a parliamentary majority, with 86 lawmakers of a total 165. Some legislators allied with Chávez have expressed willingness to support an amendment, but the opposition has not wanted to present a bill to that effect, seeking to ensure beforehand that it could be successful.
<p>



The proposals do not represent a definitive resolution to Venezuela's problems, said Carter. ''Everyone knows that the decisions should be made by the Venezuelan people, and not by the Group of Friends, the Carter Center or the OAS.''
