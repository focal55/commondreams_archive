<p>CARY, NC -- Sept. 11, 2001. The phone's ringing shatters the early morning lull in David Potorti's Cary home. It is his mother.        
<p>
  Her news: An airplane had struck the World Trade Center's North Tower, where his 53-year-old brother,  Jim, worked on the 966h floor.         
<p>
  David Potorti, 47, turned off the television after the towers collapsed. For most of the day, he and his wife cleaned out their one-car garage.         
<p>
  The garage-turned-office became a regional headquarters for the organization Potorti co-founded for victims' families, <a href="http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/" target="_new">September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows</a>. It campaigns for peaceful alternatives to military response against the Sept. 11 terrorists.        
<p>Potorti wrote his new book, &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=commondreams-20&path=tg/detail/-/0971920648/qid%3D1062696131/sr%3D8-1" target="_new"><i>September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows: Turning Our Grief into Action for Peace</i></a>,&quot; in that office. He will read from the book at the Barnes & Noble bookstore at Southpoint tonight at 7 p.m.        
<p>
  The book follows the Peaceful Tomorrows group and some of its 80 members. The small group has earned a Nobel Peace Prize nomination for its activism.         
<p>
   &quot;I think it's really a good story about ordinary people,&quot; said Potorti. &quot;You can still love our country and criticize it. I think there are a lot of stereotypes of Sept. 11 families -- that they're all thrilled that we're bombing Iraq.&quot;         
<p>
  Potorti doesn't define himself as a pacifist. He thinks that war sometimes has its uses, and he might have supported surgical strikes against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. He wants the terrorists tried and accountability for the people here &quot;who were asleep at the wheel.&quot;        
<p>
  Two years after his brother's death, David Potorti still is healing. Writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=commondreams-20&path=tg/detail/-/0971920648/qid%3D1062696131/sr%3D8-1" target="_new">the book</a> earlier this year, he wondered, &quot;Why I am so depressed?&quot; He was reliving the trauma of losing his brother while translating other Peaceful Tomorrows members' pain into words.        
<p>
  Sept. 11, 2001, was a Tuesday. By Friday, David Potorti presumed the brother who had pushed his bike and had shielded him from childhood bullies was dead. David Potorti still grieves that his son and daughter will never romp with their uncle. He still feels angry that the American government was set on pursuing a military solution -- in the name of the victims.        
<p>
  &quot;This is our tragedy. This is not George Bush's tragedy,&quot; he said. &quot;... We never talk about [the people who died]. We just think about Saddam and Osama.&quot;        
<p>
  At that time a UNC graduate student in folklore, Potorti began reaching out: writing pieces for Alternet and the Independent Weekly, taping radio commentaries in his closet. His works circulated on the Web, and soon, he found out, there were other victims' family members who opposed the war in Afghanistan.         
<p>
  Colleen Kelly, 41 of the Bronx was one of them, and her story is also featured in the book. Her 30-year-old brother, Bill, was visiting the World Trade Center for a conference.        
<p>
  &quot;The thing that struck me was this intense sorrow over Bill's death,&quot; she said via phone from New York.  &quot;But I could not justify families in Afghanistan feeling that same pain. There were families in Afghanistan who would lose a loved one not because they were involved with the Taliban, but because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, like Bill.&quot;        
<p>
  As the second anniversary of Sept. 11 approaches, Potorti will host readings and give interviews.         
<p>
  &quot;My parents spend the day in church,&quot; he said. &quot;I would prefer being public. I hate talking, but I get so much power from it.&quot;         
<p>
  <i>What: David Potorti reading        
  </i>
<p><i>
  When: Today at 7 p.m.

<p><i> Where: Barnes & Noble Booksellers, The Streets at Southpoint  Information: Call the bookstore at 806-1930</i>
