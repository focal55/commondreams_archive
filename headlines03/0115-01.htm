<p>US willingness to overlook abuses by allies in the war on terrorism, such as Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia and some Afghan warlords, undermines efforts to improve conditions around the world, Human Rights Watch said in its annual survey.</p>
<p>In its 13th annual review, comprised of reports on 58 countries, the group slammed the United States for turning a blind eye to repression in countries that provide important support for the US-led campaign against terrorism launched after September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>"The United States is far from the world's worst human rights abuser," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. "But Washington has so much power today that when it flouts human rights standards, it damages the human rights cause worldwide."</p>
<p>But the United States rejected the criticism, saying it supports the development of democracy and freedom around the world.</p>
<p>"We have made very clear in the war on terrorism we think one of the best defenses against terrorism is to have ... the kind of society that's based on economic and political freedom, where terrorism has a harder problem growing," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.</p>
<p>In the report, Human Rights Watch said that Washington had bred a "copycat phenomenon," in which other governments flout rights in the name of security.</p>
<p>"By waving the antiterrorism banner, governments such as Uzbekistan seemed to feel that they had license to persecute religious dissenters, while governments such as Russia, Israel and China seemed to feel freer to intensify repression in Chechnya, the West Bank and Xinjiang," the group said.</p>
<p>The report said Asia was now seeing its worst marginalization of human rights in decades.</p>
<p>"When the planes crashed on September 11, they drove a large hole through the region's fragile human rights architecture," the New York-based watchdog said.</p>
<p>"Perhaps more broadly than anywhere else in the world, the United States muted its criticism of opportunistic repression in Asia so as not to offend governments otherwise cooperating in the war."</p>
<p>Many Asian governments that sought to implement policies restricting human rights took advantage of the new political space provided by the war on terror, the report found.</p>
<p>The leaders of India, Nepal, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore, in particular, "were pleased to accommodate the new security agenda, which neatly dovetailed with their aspirations to increase state power and marginalize political opponents," the report said.</p>
<p>The report also criticized Tunisia for trying civilians on terror charges before military courts, and Australia for imposing "some of the tightest restrictions on asylum in the industrialized world" out of fear of letting in terrorists.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said that stifling rights in the name of security had taken "absurd proportions" in sub-Saharan Africa, with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe justifying the November 2001 arrest of six journalists for writing stories about political violence as fighting terrorists.</p>
<p>The group warned that repression in the name of security would backfire, breeding resentment of governments and the United States by the repressed. It noted resentment in Pakistan for Washington's uncritical backing of General Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a 1999 coup.</p>
<p>"To fight terrorism, you need the support of people in countries where the terrorists live," said Roth. "Cozying up to oppressive governments is hardly a way to build those alliances."</p>
<p>The report noted some improvements in human rights, including the end of wars in Angola, Sudan and Sierra Leone and moves toward peace in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>But the group lamented the continued killing of civilians in conflicts around the globe, from Colombia to the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
