<p>A federal judge, striking a dramatic blow to the government's campaign 
against medical marijuana, spared pot advocate Ed Rosenthal from a prison 
sentence Wednesday for his conviction on cultivation charges, saying Rosenthal 
believed he was acting legally.
<P>Rosenthal, 58, a prominent author, columnist and authority on marijuana 
growing, could have received at least five years in prison under federal law 
for his conviction of growing more than 100 plants for the Harm Reduction 
Center, a San Francisco dispensary operating under California's medical 
marijuana law. A federal prosecutor had asked for a 6 1/2-year sentence.

</table></font>But U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the "extraordinary, unique 
circumstances of this case" justified an exemption from the usual sentencing 
requirements. He imposed the lightest term possible -- a day in jail, which 
Rosenthal served after his February 2002 arrest. He also fined Rosenthal $1,
300 and put him on supervised release for three years with orders not to 
violate any criminal laws and to submit to searches.
<P>The packed courtroom erupted into cheers and shouts when Breyer announced 
his sentence. Some spectators wept. Moments later, the information reached a 
crowd of Rosenthal backers in the hallway, prompting another celebration.
<P>"This is Day 1 in the crusade to bring down the marijuana laws, all the 
marijuana laws," Rosenthal proclaimed after the hearing to about 100 jubilant 
supporters.
<P>Rosenthal, who had denounced Breyer as biased during the trial, was in no 
mood to praise him after the sentencing.
<P>"He did me no favors," Rosenthal said. "He made me a felon because he would 
not allow the jury to hear the whole story. He had an agenda."
<P>Rosenthal plans to appeal his conviction based on Breyer's rulings that 
kept virtually the entire defense case from the jury -- that Rosenthal was 
protected by Proposition 215, the 1996 California initiative that allowed 
seriously ill patients to obtain marijuana with a doctor's recommendation, and 
that the city of Oakland had designated him as an officer to supply marijuana 
to a patients.
<P>Prosecutors could appeal Breyer's decision to reduce the sentence below the 
standard federal guidelines. No decision has been made on an appeal, said 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Jacobs, spokesman for the office.
<P>Meanwhile, advocacy groups declared victory.
<P><b>'A VERY STRONG MESSAGE'</b>
<P>"Today marks the beginning of the end of the federal war on medical 
marijuana patients," said Robert Kampia, executive director of the nonprofit 
Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C.
<P>"It sends a very strong message to the Bush administration that they had 
better focus their law enforcement resources on serious and violent crime, 
especially terrorism, and stop arresting patients and caregivers in the nine 
states that have legalized medical marijuana," said Keith Stroup, executive 
director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
<P>Also celebrating were some of the jurors who disavowed their guilty verdict 
after learning that Rosenthal's medical marijuana defense had been kept from 
them during the trial. Seven of the 12 jurors signed a letter urging Breyer 
not to sentence Rosenthal to prison, and four attended Wednesday's hearing. 
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer also called for a lenient sentence.
<P>"Today has put my faith back into our judicial system," said juror Pamela 
Klarkowski, a registered nurse from Petaluma.
<P>The prosecution of a noted activist on his home turf was only one of a 
series of federal enforcement actions against medical marijuana operations 
since California voters approved Prop. 215, actions that have drawn increased 
resistance from local and state officials.
<P>A civil suit initially filed by the Clinton administration resulted in a U.
S. Supreme Court ruling that shut down the Oakland marijuana cooperative -- 
though more than 30 others are still operating in the state -- and both the 
Clinton and Bush administrations have sought, unsuccessfully so far, to punish 
doctors who recommend marijuana.
<P>The Bush administration has also raided pot farms and dispensaries and 
filed numerous criminal charges against medical marijuana growers, winning 
prison sentences in at least four cases, with a dozen more cases pending, 
according to advocates.
<P>Rosenthal's case was unique because of his relationship with the city of 
Oakland. Trying to shield its Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative from the federal 
crackdown, the City Council declared the organization an official city agency 
in 1998 and allowed its leaders to designate suppliers -- including Rosenthal -
- as city officers.
<P><b>BLOCKING EVIDENCE</b>
<P>Breyer, saying he was following federal drug laws, ruled before the trial 
that Rosenthal did not qualify as a narcotics law enforcement officer, which 
would have immunized him from prosecution. But he cited the same evidence 
Wednesday in his sentencing decision.
<P>Rosenthal "believed that he was not violating federal law," the judge said. 
"His belief, while erroneous, was reasonable."
<P>Because his ruling served notice that a local agency can't provide 
protection from federal charges, Breyer said, leniency for Rosenthal won't 
encourage lawbreaking by others.
<P>But Rosenthal predicted predicted to reporters that higher courts would 
find Breyer "dead wrong" on the immunity issue.
