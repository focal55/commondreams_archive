<p>A SHAKE-UP of the American administration in Iraq was under way yesterday, just three weeks into its troubled existence. The “mayor” of Baghdad was ordered home early and the retired general running Iraq was said to be cutting his mission short. 
<p>Barbara Bodine, who was due to depart yesterday, will move to the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Tara Rigler, spokeswoman for the State Department confirmed. Her tasks of restoring public services and laying the foundation of democratic government in Baghdad are far from done.

New U.S. civilian administrator to Iraq L. Paul Bremer (L), accompanied by retired General Jay Garner, arrives to meet newsmen moments after landing at Baghdad's airport, May 12, 2003. Bremer who replaces Garner, will take over reconstruction and political rehabilitation after the war that ousted Saddam Hussein. Reacting to reports that Garner would be leaving the country earlier than originally planned, Bremer said: 'I certainly intend to work with him in the next weeks here to get a bunch of serious milestones accomplished.'

</table></font>Her boss, Jay Garner, who arrived in Baghdad on April 21 for what he had said would be a three-month stint, is expected to leave soon as the reins are handed to Paul Bremer, an experienced career diplomat who was appointed by President Bush on May 6. 

<p>Widespread looting erupted across Iraq after the war, sparking gunfights with American forces, robbing the country of ancient art treasures and provoking criticism that the Pentagon had failed to plan sufficient security measures. 

<p>Four weeks after US-led forces took control of Iraq, rotting rubbish and power cuts still plague Baghdad and Iraqis are complaining at the slow arrival of aid. 

<p>The appointment of Mr Bremer, formerly the State Department’s counter-terrorism chief, appeared designed to end a tug-of-war between the State Department and the Pentagon over post-conflict policy, which has appeared, at times, to be paralyzing the decision-making process in Iraq. 

<p>Mr Bremer, a Republican, has solid ties to the neo- conservatives who hold sway at the Pentagon and, as a civilian, he should help to ease the extraction of aid from foreign donors, who had been suspicious of the appointment of a retired general. 

<p>Inter-agency tensions in Washington resurfaced even in the days before Mr Bush announced his appointment. 

<p>State Department officials were happy to confirm the selection of “a man we can talk to”, who they said would report to Mr Bush. 

<p>Meanwhile Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, issued a two-line statement noting the White House had yet to speak on the matter and saying that his man was doing “a truly outstanding job”. 
<p>In the end, Mr Bush came up with a compromise — a conservative diplomat who would report to Mr Rumsfeld. 
<p>Mr Bremer, 61, is on a tour of the Gulf region and is expected in Baghdad soon. 
<p>He has a reputation as a powerful mediator whose chairmanship of a bipartisan terrorism commission in 1999 and 2000 was unusually harmonious, according to his vice-chair, a Democrat. “He’s a man who is a consensus-builder, very intelligent and highly ethical,” Maurice Sonnenberg, a senior international adviser to law and investment firms, said. 
<p>State Department officials say that Ms Bodine’s term was meant to run for two months only and that she had always been expected to take up her new post, in which she will negotiate deals shielding US Forces from prosecution by the International Criminal Court. But she told The Washington Post that news of her withdrawal came in a late-night call to a telephone that had been set up in her office only hours before, without an explanation. 

<p>Neo-conservative commentators have accused her of hampering an FBI investigation into the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen, where she was Ambassador at the time. They see her as a State Department “Arabist”, who promotes stability rather than the power of American leadership to enforce democratic change — a key pillar of their thinking.
