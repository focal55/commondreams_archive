<p>TIKRIT, Iraq  - U.S. troops lost the hearts and  minds of some Iraqis on Tuesday in aggressive pre-dawn house  raids in the hometown of Saddam Hussein, blowing open gates,  kicking down doors and shoving faces in the dirt.<P>
Ten-year-old Ahmed, herded with the rest of his family into  his garden, shook visibly as he watched soldiers interrogate  one man, whose head slammed onto the ground with a thud.<P>
"I will become an Iraqi fighter and I will kill Americans,"  the boy said. He pointed at troops who charged into his home  with rifles, sledgehammers and bolt-cutters hunting for  anti-American guerrillas. "They are the enemy," he said.<P>

  </table></font>An old, barefoot man was led from his house over shards of  glass from a broken picture frame knocked off the wall.<P>
A balding man with a gray beard and dark tunic sat with his  hands cuffed behind his back. "Why did you smash the gate  down?" he asked the soldiers pointing their weapons at his  chest. "I would have let you in."<P>
The U.S. military raids dozens of homes each day throughout  Iraq, trying to stem the flood of mine, grenade and mortar  attacks against them by rounding up suspected assailants.<P>
Senior commanders say the strategy has helped wrest the  initiative from the guerrillas who have killed 73 U.S. soldiers  since Washington declared major combat over in Iraq on May 1.<P>
But they acknowledge that when innocent Iraqis are caught  up in the raids, it deepens distrust of the occupiers and can  undermine the goodwill the soldiers generate by projects such  as restoring electricity that aim to win over "hearts and  minds."<P>
While the United States said it invaded Iraq to free its  people and eliminate a threat posed by Saddam, critics say the  war has backfired, inflaming Arab anger at the West and  creating fertile ground for recruiting anti-American fighters.<P>
At the end of Tuesday's raid, troops said they did not know  if any of roughly a dozen detained men were the suspects they  had targeted in what they dubbed "Operation High Five."<P>
But Lieutenant David Poirier, who led the raids, said  soldiers found explosives material in one home. "I am certain  we found some bad guys," he said.<P>
U.S. commanders say they believe Saddam is probably still  in the area around Tikrit but they have yet to find him.<P>
DEFIANT WOMEN<P>
During one of Tuesday's raids, a young girl cowered in a  woman's lap pressing her hands over her ears to block out the  soldiers' yells of "Get down, get down." Sitting cross-legged,  an old woman dressed all in black, rocked back and forth,  muttering to herself with her cheeks cupped in her hands.<P>
Three women angrily remonstrated in the Arabic the soldiers  do not understand. They jabbed fingers toward them or raised  their hands above their heads, accusing the intruders of  stealing money inside.<P>
The women, who insisted on being allowed to wear  head-dresses, only stopped shouting once. Their mouths dropped  open when they noticed one of the tall soldiers guarding them,  hair hidden beneath a helmet, was a square-jawed woman.<P>
But when the soldiers turned to leave, the defiant women  followed after the soldiers and began shouting again.<P>
With the women screaming "Go, go," in English, Ahmed  quietly held out a pair of sandals hoping a soldier would take  them to a barefoot detainee. The gate was slammed in his face.<P>
