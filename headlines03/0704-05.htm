<p>Silvio Berlusconi waded back into a political storm, saying his expression of regret to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for a Nazi slur against a German MEP had not amounted to an apology, rekindling a row which seemed to be subsiding.</p>

Italy's Far Rightwing Billionaire Prime Minister Berlusconi says he made no apology for Nazi slur<br>
</font> </td>
</tr>
</table></font>Berlusconi's comments came just as it seemed the diplomatic spat might be abating after his heavily qualified expression of regret Thursday was accepted by Schroeder, who had demanded a full apology.</p>
<p>"Yesterday I made no apology," a defiant Berlusconi told a news conference in Rome flanked by EU Commission President Romano Prodi after talks with European commissioners. </p>
<p>Friday's talks were supposed to set the tone of the Italian presidency, but instead found themselves overshadowed by the diplomatic spat of Berlusconi's own making.</p>
<p>The outspoken billionaire prime minister reiterated that in his telephone call to Schroeder he had "strongly underlined that I had been offended" by the German member of the European Parliament, and had expressed regret if his remarks, meant to be ironic, had been "mininterpreted."</p>
<p>MEP Martin Schulz had raised questions in the European Parliament on Wednesday about the Italian media magnate's ongoing conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Berlusconi sparked political uproar and a serious diplomatic spat between Rome and Berlin when he retorted by telling Schulz he could star as a Nazi concentration camp guard in a film.</p>
<p>But in trying to rationalise his quip on Friday, Berlusconi -- who told journalists the MEP reminded him of a character in the 1960s US television series "Hogan's Heroes" -- may only have succeeded in making it worse.</p>
<p>"There was a Sergeant Schultz who shouted a lot but in the end was a good sort, people were taking the mickey out of him all the time," the premier said of the popular programme about a World War II prisoner of war camp.</p>
<p>It became quickly clear earlier Friday that the prime minister's qualified apology to the chancellor in a phone call late Thursday would not draw a line under the scandal.</p>
<p>European Parliament President Pat Cox "considers that these regrets amount to progress but it's to the European Parliament that Mr Berlusconi must present his excuses in public," Cox's spokesman David Hartley told AFP.</p>
<p>He made it clear that Berlusconi's excuses must be "made publicly and to the parliament."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the German government in Berlin said he had "nothing further to add" beyond the position presented at a news conference earlier Friday.</p>
<p>Then, the chief government spokesman Bela Anda had said Berluconi's expression of regret "was interpreted generally to mean an apology. The rest is just semantics, questions that we don't want to get involved in."</p>
<p>Schulz, the target of the jibe, said the explanation would not suffice.</p>
<p>"If Berlusconi were to say: people, I am wrong, it won't be repeated, then this incident is settled. It has to be made clear to him, this is not a boxing match," Schulz told German radio.</p>
<p>What rankles appears to be the qualified nature of the expression of "regret", in which Berlusconi insisted he had also been insulted and that his irony had been "misinterpreted".</p>
<p>The outburst, which heaped international outrage on Italy as its began its six-month presidency, also reportedly drew a sharp rebuke from President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who called Berlusconi to a meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ciampi called for a "return to wisdom and serenity" when he addressed EU commissioners and Italy's government at a dinner on Thursday night.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow the painful controversy which disrupted the debate in Strasbourg to weigh on the future work of the European Union. </p>
<p>The row momentarily put in the shade the deep emnity Berlusconi shares with Prodi, a former centre-left Italian prime minister he has accused of corruption.</p>
<p>Berlusconi's own trial, in which he is accused of bribing judges in a 1985 business deal also involving Prodi, has been suspended under a controversial immunity law passed last month.</p>
<p>Berlusconi announced he would make a two-day visit to the United States for talks with US President George W. Bush on July 21. He is scheduled to meet Bush the following day.</p>
<p>The Italian prime minister, whose pro-US stance over the war in Iraq has irked some of his European colleagues, has been criticised in some quarters for concentrating more on relations with the United States than with other EU member states.</p>
