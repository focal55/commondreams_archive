<p>Faced with growing public questioning of his department's anti-terrorism policies, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft plans to kick off a cross-country tour next week focused on defending the USA Patriot Act and other legislation as vital tools in the fight against terrorism.</p>

</table>Justice Department officials said the series of appearances at more than a dozen stops from Philadelphia to Salt Lake City will be aimed at countering criticism from civil liberties groups and some lawmakers that authorities have gone too far in wielding anti-terrorism powers granted by Congress after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</p>
    <p>Much of the recent criticism has focused on the Patriot Act, wide-ranging legislation that dramatically strengthened the ability of the Justice Department and FBI to monitor people alleged to be terrorists or their associates. The legislation was easily approved by Congress in the weeks following the Sept. 11 attacks and has been praised by federal law enforcement officials as a crucial reform of outdated counterterrorism policies.</p>
    <p>But Ashcroft's travel plans underscore growing concerns within the Bush administration at increasing criticism from Congress, opposition from cities and counties across the United States and attacks from Democratic presidential candidates.</p>
    <p>More than 140 cities and counties, in addition to state legislatures in Alaska, Hawaii and Vermont, have approved resolutions condemning the Patriot Act and, in a few cases, refusing to enforce it. Justice officials were also blindsided last month by the House, which voted 309 to 118 to cut off funding for part of the law that allows the government to conduct "sneak and peek" searches of private property. The act comes up for review by Congress in 2005.</p>
    <p>"The decision has been made that it's time that we get out there and talk about the successes," said one Justice official, who asked not to be identified. "There have been a lot of mischaracterizations of certain authorities that Congress gave the Justice Department, and we need to set the record straight."</p>
    <p>The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Justice over one provision of the Patriot Act that allows the government to seize business, library and computer records without disclosing it has done so. "There's been a groundswell of opposition around the country to provisions of the Patriot Act that go too far in abridging civil liberties, and the Justice Department is finally reacting to this,"  said Timothy Edgar, the ACLU's legislative counsel. </p>
    <p>Ashcroft and other Justice officials, including FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, have long defended the Patriot Act as crucial to the government's ability to monitor and halt would-be terrorists. The legislation lowered many of the legal walls that had prohibited criminal investigators and intelligence officials from sharing information, and strengthened the ability of FBI agents to conduct surveillance and physical searches in terrorism probes.</p>
    <p>Justice officials said yesterday that Ashcroft's itinerary has not been finalized, but would begin with a policy-focused speech in Washington on Aug. 19, followed by planned appearances in cities including Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Salt Lake City.</p>
    <p>During appearances on several Sunday television talk shows earlier this month, Ashcroft forcefully defended the Patriot Act and endorsed other changes in federal counterterrorism law.</p>
    <p>One proposal mentioned by Ashcroft would allow investigators to obtain administrative subpoenas in terrorism cases without the approval of a judge. The change is included as part of a broad package now in draft form on Capitol Hill aimed primarily, but not solely, at drug traffickers alleged to be engaged in terrorist activities.</p>
