<p>WASHINGTON, March 9 — After a weekend of urgent diplomacy, the Bush administration has so far fallen short of lining up nine votes on the United Nations Security Council in favor of a resolution that would threaten Saddam Hussein with war if Iraq did not disarm, administration officials said today. </p>
<P> The officials said they remained hopeful that at least 9 of the 15 Council members would eventually back the resolution, introduced by Britain on Friday and setting a March 17 deadline for Iraqi compliance. Also on Friday, the United States put others on notice to be ready for a vote on Tuesday, but one official said the vote could slip until later in the week as efforts continued to widen American support. </p>
<P> Chile and Guinea, two crucial swing votes, indicated over the weekend that they were not yet ready to say yes.</p>
<P> "We don't have it in the bank," an administration official said, adding that the United States would nonetheless press for a vote this week. </p>
<P> As part of the effort to persuade wavering Council members, an administration official said the United States would "likely" agree to define the benchmarks Iraq would have to meet before the deadline, although those would almost certainly be specified outside the resolution. </p>
<P> Iraq, meanwhile, said it was doing all it could to cooperate already. Any remaining questions about its disarmament, it said, were "technical aspects" being exploited by the United States and Britain as a "pretext" for war. </p>
<P> The statement seemed intended to deepen divisions between Washington and its allies. Even the staunchest of these, Prime Minister Tony Blair, faced widening dissent as a leading cabinet secretary threatened to quit if Britain supported war without a resolution. </p>
<P> With other major European allies in open opposition to war, the Bush administration has for several weeks pursued a strategy of trying to get nine Security Council votes committed in support of a resolution, and then hope that France and Russia would at least abstain and not wield a veto in the face of a majority. </p>
<P> Both France and Russia, along with China, the United States and Britain, have the power to kill a measure on the Security Council if they vote no. France has said it would not "allow" a war measure to pass, which has been interpreted to mean that it will indeed use its veto. </p>
<P> But some American officials say they believe that the French may be bluffing and would not want to be seen as blocking a measure with broad backing. Administration officials also hope that Russia might abstain rather than veto, isolating France as the only negative among the five veto-bearing members. </p>
<P> Administration officials say that even with a veto, a measure that has received nine votes might command moral legitimacy in the eyes of much of the world. </p>
<P> As the diplomatic efforts unfolded, administration officials said on television today that there could be no delay past March 17. Privately, however, some officials said it might be possible for that deadline to slip slightly if that would help secure nine votes on the Council.</p>
<P> "If somebody comes to us and says, `Give us a few more days, and we'll vote for you,' it's something we would have to consider," an administration official said. But he ruled out any delay longer than that, on the grounds that it would seem only to weaken Western resolve.</p>
<P> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, appearing on television today, stuck firmly with the March 17 deadline.</p>
<P> "If there is a resolution passed and he hasn't done what is required by the 17th, then he's lost his last chance," Mr. Powell said, referring to Mr. Hussein. "At that point, I think there's a high likelihood that military force is what's going to disarm Saddam Hussein by changing his regime."</p>
<P> In recent days, there appeared to be divisions in the administration and between the United States and its closest ally, Britain, over the setting of deadlines. It was Britain that persuaded a reluctant President Bush to agree last week to include a new deadline in the next resolution. </p>
<P> British diplomats argued that extending the deadline to March 17 was necessary to get the votes, especially of Chile and Guinea, two of six wavering members of the Council. Of the nine votes needed, four are committed — the United States, Britain, Spain and Bulgaria. So the United States needs five of the six uncommitted nations. </p>
<P> Over the weekend, the press in Chile printed statements from President Ricardo Lagos that Chile wanted the deadline extended a bit further than March 17. Similar comments were made by a Guinean diplomat on Friday.</p>
<P> At a closed session of the Security Council on Friday afternoon, the Chilean envoy, Gabriel Valdes, pushed for adding some benchmarks to the resolution to measure Iraqi compliance, according to two people present.</p>
<P> Without them, he asked in frustration, how could anyone know if Iraq had complied, the two observers said. They said Mr. Valdes had questioned how anyone could recognize a change of heart by Mr. Hussein. "Is it like a religious conversion?" he asked.</p>
<P> In the last two weeks, Chilean diplomats have suggested a compromise framework resembling one put forward last month by Canada. The Canadian plan envisions a short-term deadline, possibly of March 31, with interim reports from United Nations weapons inspectors on how Iraq is complying.</p>
<P> Speaking today on the ABC News program "This Week," Canada's prime minister, Jean Chrétien, said: "I thought that there is a way to bridge, probably it's too late, but the Americans and the Brits and the Spaniards moved yesterday. But they need probably to move more. That is the impression I have." </p>
<P> He added, "Perhaps a couple of more weeks could help — I don't know." </p>
<P> Appearing on Fox television today, Mr. Powell was asked whether it was true, as former President Jimmy Carter had asserted, that the United States' world stature had plunged and that most countries in the world no longer trusted Washington.</p>
<P> Denying the charge, Mr. Powell listed Spain, Britain, Bulgaria, Portugal, Australia and several nations once in the orbit of the Soviet Union as supportive. </p>
<P> "We need to knock down this idea that nobody is on our side," he said. "So many nations recognize this danger. And they do it in the face of public opposition."</p>
<P> But once again over the weekend, the United States was facing tough questions by the nations it was courting, principally in their citations of statements in reports by Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, that their inspection program was disclosing weapons and succeeding in getting many of them destroyed.</p>
<P> In an interview on Saturday, Dr. ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said: "We do not have any evidence that Iraq has a nuclear weapons program or has revived its defunct nuclear weapons program. We still have work to do. This is still an interim assessment. I have said that I need at least two to three months." He was referring to the time before a more complete judgment could be made.</p>
<P> Even with the extra time, he said, "I can never give absolute guarantees," adding: "We minimize the risks to the extent possible. But because there is always a certain degree of risk in any inspection process, I'd like to be there acting as a deterrence, acting as a powerful verification to make sure if we have missed something, if Iraq has changed its mind, we are there.</p>
<P> "That's really the function of an inspection," he said. "We are not gods. We do not provide any certification."</p>
<P> American diplomats acknowledged that their biggest challenge was in persuading the world, particularly the other Council members, that Mr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei were incorrect when they suggested that the inspections were working so well that they needed more time to carry them out.</p>
<P> With more than a quarter of a million troops massing in the Persian Gulf, an atmosphere of "it's now or never" is pervading American officials' comments, even though much of the world does not see it that way.</p>
<P> The diplomatic wrangling aside, military analysts have suggested that if it does come to war, the United States might want to begin military action before April, when temperatures start to soar in the gulf. </p>
<P> Mr. Powell said that Mr. Blix was "a decent, honest man" but that it was difficult to go along with French demands for more inspections when it was the French, he said, who opposed further inspections in the late 1990's.</p>
<P> He warned that if France did veto the resolution, the United States and France would remain friends but that such an action "will have a serious effect on bilateral relations at least in the short term."</p>
<P> Ms. Rice, asked on ABC television if the United States would be willing to give Iraq another week or two after March 17, declined to answer. "We're talking to our allies; we're talking to people on the Security Council," she said. "But we really believe that the time has come for the Security Council to stand up and be counted here."</p>
