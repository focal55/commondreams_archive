<p>Three hundred law school students from across California took out a 
full-page ad in today's New York Times charging that the Bush administration 
has undermined constitutional and civil rights law with its war on terrorism.
<P>The advertisement, which is running in the Times' western edition, lists 
the names of students from eight law schools across the state, including UC 
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, UC's Hastings College of the Law in San 
Francisco and Stanford Law School.
<P>"Tomorrow's lawmakers shouldn't have to answer for today's misdeeds," the 
ad reads. "As students of the law, we cannot stand behind a boundless 'War on 
Terrorism' that has eroded civil liberties, undermined international 
institutions, blurred the separation of governmental powers, and caused havoc 
in the communities we serve both here and abroad."
<P>Abby Reyes, 29, a Boalt Hall student who co-founded the effort, said that 
students had begun working last fall to draft the ad and an accompanying 
policy statement, which is posted on the Internet.
<P>"What we are learning in the classroom is very different from what is 
happening in Washington," Reyes said. "As law students, we have a role and 
responsibility in offering a wake-up call to our own profession."
<P>All of the students paid at least $25 to be in the ad, while donations from 
faculty and other students covered the $18,000 tab to run it.
<P>Mazen Basrawi, a 23-year-old Boalt Hall student who is Muslim and Arab 
American, said he had signed it because of the impact Bush administration 
policies such as racial profiling had had on his community.
<P>"They are stripping noncitizens of what is left of their existing rights, 
and engaging in illegal foreign policy," he said. "It's those sorts of things 
that have affected our communities."
<P>White House spokesman Ken Lisaius said he had not been aware of the ad 
before being contacted last night.
<P>"People in the U.S. are free to peacefully protest and make their opinions 
known," Lisaius said. "It is a strength of our democracy."
<P>But he added, "There are large numbers of people that very much support the 
president's fighting a war on terror and understand that a Saddam Hussein 
armed with biological, chemical or nuclear weapons would threaten not only his 
region, but the entire world."
<P>Signing the ad in addition to the UC and Stanford students were those from 
UC Davis, Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, the University of San 
Diego, Golden Gate University and New College of California in San Francisco.
<P>The edition of the paper carrying the ad is delivered to 200,000 
subscribers in 13 states, according to the student group.
<P>"The amount of time and effort that the students put into writing the ad, 
raising the money and collecting all the signatures from all over the state 
really demonstrates a depth of commitment and a level of concern that reflects 
an ever increasing opposition to the Bush administration's attack on civil 
liberties," said Lucas Guttentag, a Boalt Hall professor and director of the 
Immigrant Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.
<P>California students said they had heard from other law school students -- 
including a group from several Boston-area schools -- who might pursue a 
similar effort.
<P>"By the different schools in California coming together, it sends a 
stronger message," said Forest Wilkerson, a third-year law student at the 
University of San Diego. "We're hoping it catches on."
