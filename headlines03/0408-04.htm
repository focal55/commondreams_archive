<p>Looking deep into the Baghdad blackout, I can see the tiniest pinprick of red light - but this light casts a beam that is as enormous as it is confronting.</p>
<p>It's on the levee  that stops the Tigris River from flooding into what was Saddam Hussein's presidential compound. Tonight the leader's sprawling complex is the forward base for the US thrust into Iraq, and the red light marks the bivouac of a US infantry unit.</p>
<p>Tonight those turbid Tigris waters separate more than me and the US soldiers.</p>
<p>I'm on the east side of the city; just back in my room at the Sheraton after a dash to the middle-class suburb of Mansour. </p>

</table></font>Along the way  it seems most of the armed men who have been behind sandbags, guarding government buildings, are gone. The Foreign Ministry, the Information Ministry and the Planning Ministry stand naked to US attacks.</p>
<p>But there is still one guard near the inter-city bus station, and he seems to be there for the long haul. He cradles a grenade launcher as he sits by his pavement post in a brown, crushed-velvet armchair.</p>
<p>There are signs of the morning's progress through the city of the US armored column that took the compound. The road near the bus station is cratered, its perimeter wall has been blasted and an incinerated  police car lies off to the side of the road.</p>
<p>On Sadoun Street a man dressed in black jeans, black open-necked shirt and a black leather vest approaches and tells me: "Three thousand today". I think he is talking about the war's death toll, but it turns out that he's a currency dealer, offering 3000 Iraqi dinars to the US dollar. </p>
<p>We speed past al-Zawra Park, where Iraqi forces are hiding cannons and truckloads of ammunition in the shadow of the gum trees; and past another public garden, from which four Iraqi surface-to-surface missiles streak westwards into the setting sun.</p>
<p>Then we lurch around a traffic island adorned with a jowly bust of the caliph al-Mansour. It was he who built the ancient round city of Baghdad  in AD762.</p>
<p>He had traits in common with today's leader - he had an edifice complex and he was a security paranoid. But not even he could have had the high-tech, high-powered US 3rd Infantry in mind when he mused about how the trade-route Tigris,  as he did centuries ago,  would bring the world to the city that had yet to become the setting for the tales of <I>The Thousand and One Nights</I>.</p>
<p>I've broken away from observing the battle for the presidential compound to look at a gaping hole in the ground in Mansour, but it is the second visit of the day to this neighborhood for the silver-haired Sabah, who is more than a driver to us.</p>
<p>He comes behind us, cleaning up our mess; arriving at the door early each morning with a flask of Madame Sabah's excellent Turkish coffee or, late at night, with a couple of cans of Red Bull when he thinks we need an energy hit; he produces a meal from nothing when all the restaurants are closed; and he looks out for us in the daily war of attrition with the rest of Baghdad - fast-thinking currency bandits, slow-thinking information bureaucrats and the like.</p>
<p>Earlier, Sabah walked out of Mansour's al-Saha restaurant - with our take-out lunch - only minutes before a huge explosion made shards of its windows, lacerating customers and freaking the neighborhood.  But that is nothing compared with the real damage a block away.</p>
<p>Four or five houses have disappeared and in their place is a crater maybe 30-40 meters wide and 15-20 meters deep.</p>
<p>Some of the photographers use a chilling term they picked up from the US military in Afghanistan  to describe what might have happened to a dozen or more people thought to have died in this missile attack. They have become "pink mist".</p>
<p>The smoldering crater is littered with the artifacts of ordinary middle-class life in Baghdad - a crunched Passat sedan, a wrought-iron front gate, the armrest of a chair upholstered in green brocade and a broken bedhead.</p>
<p>The top floors of surrounding buildings are sheared off. Mud thrown by the force of the blast cakes what is left of them, and the nearby date palms are decapitated. Bulldozers and rescue crews work frantically, peeling back the rubble in the hope of finding survivors.</p>
<p>Neighbors and relatives of the home-owners weep openly in the street, some embracing to ease the pain and all of them wondering why such a powerful missile was dumped on them after the US has stated its heavy bombing campaign is over.</p>
<p>But this is an opportunistic strike. Four bunker-busters  - 2000-pound JDAM bombs - are dropped  on the house in which the US "believes" Saddam, his sons and other top officials "might" have been meeting.  </p>
<p>Anonymous US officials are quoted saying that on Monday they had received intelligence of a high-level meeting in Mansour of Iraqi intelligence officials and, "possibly", Saddam and his two sons, Qusay and Uday.</p>
<p>But that cuts no ice with the Neighbors The nearest house has stood for 43 years but now it is on the verge of collapse and the adult children of the blood-splattered engineer Fadel al-Imam, aged 75, are working to convince him he must leave.</p>
<p>With his back to the door of his wrecked library, where floor-to-ceiling shelves bulge with a lifetime's collection of engineering texts and there is a shattered photo of his policeman father in the service of the last Western occupiers of Iraq, the British, he says: "I reserve the right not to obey any government.</p>
<p>"This will create more enemies for the Americans. Even those who were feeling good about the arrival of the Americans will want to fight now."</p>
<p>We can only guess at what will happen next.</p>
<p>Washington is in a hurry to show Iraqis and the world that it has come here as a force for its version of  good. But even as it pulls down statues of Saddam, desperate to satisfy its hope for a legitimizing and "spontaneous"  revolt, the people of Baghdad are reluctant to respond.</p>
<p>And probably more so after any future opportunistic strikes.</p>
<p>All they see is the nightmare around them - the vandalism of their telephone system; the terror of the blackouts; the trauma of overburdened, ill-equipped hospitals struggling to cope with the dead and injured; and an imminent health crisis as millions go without clean water.</p>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld seems to recognize some of this. Despite the capture of the compound, he says: "I can't say we are at a tipping point."</p>
<p>And showing that they remember none of their own history here, Britain's top commander, Air Marshal Brian Burridge, wants civilian Iraqis to do the heavy lifting. "What we are looking for is the effect on the people of Iraq. Once they say this regime no longer exists in our psyche, then we have reached it."</p>
<p>How much more firepower will they apply to make the people do their bidding?</p>
<p>The next step for the Americans is likely to be an advance on the east of the city on several fronts. And it is when they get into the labyrinthine suburbs on this side, as opposed to the parkland they now hold on the west bank, that we will have a sense of the extent of the street fighting to come.</p>
<p>So far the military engagement in Baghdad has been conventional. There will be no street-fighting, no guerilla tactics until small US units make targets of themselves as they patrol the exposed streets and alleys of the east.</p>
<p>We can't reckon yet on how many in the Republican Guard and Saddam's fedayeen will look over their shoulder and see  the consolidating grip of the US-led invasion force on the rest of the country or at the ravaged presidential compound now in US hands, and conclude that it is time to shed their uniforms and join their families.</p>
<p>As evening set in, I could see a couple of Americans sitting on the levee wall, dangling their legs as they took the last of the sun after an at-times ferocious, day-long battle to wrest control of the compound from the Republican Guards who stayed to fight.</p>
<p>And on the internet  I was able to look at pictures, taken by my colleagues  with  US forces,  of other US soldiers tramping through Saddam's trashed ballroom, sitting back in his armchairs and rifling his desk.</p>
<p>Now it is 5am, pre-dawn. The pinprick of light is gone and Iraqi fighters are lobbing countless missiles at the compound. There is the crackle of intense small-arms fire. This will probably prove to be no more than an irritant in the overall scheme of things, but it does confirm that this is not the "tipping point".</p>
<p>This is Day Two of the US occupation of the presidential compound, but it is the Iraqi flag that still flies on the Republican Palace.</p>
