<p>NEW YORK - 
A former gun lobbyist has agreed to testify for the NAACP in a lawsuit alleging negligent marketing practices by gun manufacturers and distributors fuels street violence that victimizes minorities.

<p>
It will be the first time Robert Ricker, who once worked as an attorney for the National Rifle Association, has testified for gun opponents since he switched allegiance.
<p>
"He's a true insider," said attorney Elisa Barnes, who will represent the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at the federal trial set to begin Monday. "He met and worked with the heads of all these companies."
<p>
The lawsuit alleges irresponsible marketing of handguns has "led to disproportionate numbers of injuries, deaths and other damages among those whose interests the (NAACP) represents."
<p>
 Unlike other gun-liability cases across the country, the NAACP seeks no monetary damages. Instead, it asks for injunctions that would place sweeping restrictions on buyers and sellers of handguns.
<p>
 Industry advocates deny allegations by Ricker that gun makers knowingly sell their products to corrupt dealers who supply criminals.
<p>
 Lawrence Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, called Ricker's claims "outrageous and highly offensive."
<p>
 "He doesn't scare me in the least," Keane said.
<p>
 Ricker, 52, made a living as an attorney for the NRA in the 1980s, and later as an executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, a now-defunct trade group. He had a falling out with industry executives in the late 1990s after advocating a series of voluntary gun safety measures.
<p>
 In February, Ricker was reinvented as a whistleblower. In an affidavit filed in support of a California lawsuit against gun manufacturers, he alleged the industry "knowingly resisted" taking steps to monitor the bulk sale of guns to federally licensed gun dealers.
<p>
 "It has been a common practice of gun manufacturers and distributors to adopt a 'see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil' approach," Ricker said in court papers.
<p>
 Gun-control advocates considered the affidavit a bombshell.
<p>
 "There's no question the industry was shaken by this," said Dennis Henigan, legal director for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "He was one of their major mouthpieces for years."
<p>
 Ricker, through Barnes, declined to be interviewed for this story.
<p>
 The NAACP's lawsuit seeks to force distributors to restrict sales to dealers who have storefront outlets, prohibit sales to gun show dealers and limit individual purchasers to one handgun a month.
<p>
 The more than 80 defendants include Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. and Glock Inc., as well as several gun distributors.
<p>
 The defendants argue it's unfair and unlawful to hold them liable for the criminal use of a legal product. They also say legislatures &#151; not courts &#151; should set standards for sales.

<p>
 "The industry cares deeply about the lawful sale and distribution of its products," Keane said.
<p>
At trial, NAACP lawyers plan to try to bolster Ricker's claims with records from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms detailing how the agency enlists gun manufacturers to trace the source of weapons used in crimes. The data, the lawyers argue, show the defendants knew which dealers were disreputable but still sold them weapons.
<p>
Barnes used jurisdictional rules to steer the case to U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who is considered sympathetic to gun control. The judge has decided the jury will play only an "advisory role," leaving himself to make the final determination on liability and remedy.
<p>
In its literature, the gun lobby has bemoaned the case, calling Barnes a "radical anti-gun lawyer," and Weinstein an "activist, anti-gun jurist."
