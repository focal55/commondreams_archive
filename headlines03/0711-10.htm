</table>Two big efforts under way this summer incorporate characters that 
      appeal to small children: Clifford the Big Red Dog and the Care Bears. The 
      40-year-old Clifford appears in dozens of easy-to-read picture books in 
      various languages, with an estimated 100 million copies sold worldwide. 
      The Care Bears had their moment in the early 1980's with a generation that 
      is experiencing parenthood now. Both properties are linked to a kind of 
      basic morality, and both are being harnessed in the business of 
      selling.<p></P>
      <P>The Care Bears, licensed by <a href="http://www.americangreetings.com/" target="_new">American Greetings</a>, are featured in a 
      program meant to rekindle interest in the characters among children ages 3 
      to 7. American Greetings plans a major home video and DVD line for the 
      characters next year.</P>
      <P>The program was created by Youth Marketing International, a 
      Manhattan-based company that has worked with corporations like Kraft 
      Foods and  Barnes 
      &amp; Noble to market products to children from the barely hatched (as 
      in 2 years old) to the well advanced (enrolled in college).</P>
      <P>"I looked at this as an opportunity to provide materials to 25,000 
      schools," said Michael Brown, the vice president for licensing at American 
      Greetings, which is perhaps best known for its card business. "Schools 
      have budget cuts all the time and teachers use their own money to buy 
      supplies. Preschools are less apt to have large budgets."</P>
      <P>Into the vacuum will go posters, worksheets and other materials 
      featuring the Care Bears, who number 10 in all and have names like 
      Funshine Bear and Good Luck Bear. Each character is supposed to represent 
      a different emotion, Mr. Brown said, and one idea behind the program is 
      that children will learn a kind of preschool social compact. Suggested 
      activities include a penny drive and other public service projects.</P>
      <P>Parents will also receive a letter highlighting a corporate creation 
      called National Care Week, scheduled for November, and including a 
      certificate for parent and child to sign, declaring that they care.</P>
      <P>"The Care Bears live in a star-speckled, rainbow-trimmed cotton candy 
      world called Care-a-lot," the literature, prepared for teachers by Youth 
      Marketing International, reads. "Talk with your students about the tummy 
      graphic for each bear and how it helps us understand what that bear 
      represents. To reinforce their meaning, play a matching game with your 
      students. Help them name emotions that go with each graphic." The 
      literature adds, "During small-group time, help your students decide what 
      kind of Care Bear they would be." </P>
      <P>Marketing for small children isn't quite at the level it has reached 
      in, say, Taiwan, where a chain of kindergartens named for Tweety, the 
      Warner Brothers cartoon character, features pictures of the quick-thinking 
      canary in schools and provides Tweety uniforms for the children to wear. 
      But there is no question that marketing to the very young, which has been 
      escalating for the last two years, is a focus for the makers of consumer 
      products and the purveyors of educational materials.</P>
      <P>Joel Ehrlich (<a href="mailto:joelehrlich@YMI-Ltd.com">joelehrlich@YMI-Ltd.com</a>), the president of <a href="http://www.youthmarketingint.com" target="_new">Youth Marketing International</a>, said the 
      Care Bears material was created by his company after American Greetings 
      paid a fee. He would not disclose the fee, but said companies typically 
      pay an amount "in six figures."</P>
      <P>Mr. Ehrlich, a former New York City schoolteacher who was more recently 
      named "Kid Marketer of the Year" by Brandweek, said the Care Bears package 
      would be promoted to about a third of the nation's 75,000 preschools, many 
      of which are run by profit-making companies. The materials are provided 
      free to the preschools.</P>
      <P>"We go to about 25,000 of them and say, `We have a wonderful program,' 
      " he said. "We work very closely with the organization, decide who the 
      audience is and what the materials should be. We go directly to teachers 
      with it."</P>
      <P>While the messages may promote empathy and other worthwhile emotional 
      development, one critic said that presenting such materials to children 
      barely out of diapers represented a new low in marketing.</P>
      <P>"This is all part of advertisers' brazenness," said Gary Ruskin, 
      executive director of Commercial Alert, an advocacy group in Portland, 
      Ore., that regularly battles marketing in schools. "The assault on our 
      youngest kids is vicious and growing in intensity."</P>
      <P>He said the effect on children included "marketing-related diseases," 
      including diabetes and other health problems that can result from 
      overconsumption of sugary snacks &#8212; implicitly endorsed, he said, by 
      schools that allow snack sales or their advertising presence in 
      cafeterias, hallways and classrooms. And there is another effect, he said: 
      "The aggregated message is to glorify materialism," which can produce 
      children who want things excessively and whine if they don't get them.</P>
      <P>"Obviously, we're in business," Mr. Brown said. At the same time, he 
      added: "We're not in this, though, to make a bazillion dollars. At the end 
      of the day, American Greetings is a company that specializes in marketing 
      social-expression products."</P>
      <P>Clifford is to be part of a wider curriculum sold by Scholastic. Akimi 
      Gibson, the company's vice president and general manager for early 
      childhood education, said the dog character would take the form of 
      Clifford's Kit for Personal and Social Development, which teaches 
      responsibility and other values. It is part of "a full-day, integrated, 
      research-based curriculum," Ms. Gibson said, which is priced at $2,600 and 
      will be in preschools across Texas starting this fall. </P>
      <P>Clifford is being used because "the parents know Clifford," Ms. Gibson 
      said. "He is a beloved character and has withstood the test of time. He 
      espouses the same kind of values that parents want to engender in their 
      children." Nevertheless, "We didn't really build it around Clifford," she 
      said. "What we did was pay attention to what Clifford does well."</P>
      <P>The entire curriculum has been used for months in the Children's World 
      chain of day care centers. Now Children's World is marketing itself 
      vigorously to parents by highlighting that curriculum. </P>
      <P>"When it comes to preparing your child for school success, you expect 
      the best and Children's World understands," the company's Web site 
      declares. "That's why we're pleased to bring you our new Pathways 
      Pre-Kindergarten Program, filled with fun and educational activities 
      carefully designed to help bring out your child's natural curiosity and 
      encourage a lifelong joy of learning. Developed by Scholastic, the 
      curriculum uses themed learning units that incorporate reading, writing, 
      math, science, social studies and more." </P>
      <P>The Clifford component promises "materials on building character like 
      learning respect," as well as cooperation and responsibility.</P>
      <P>"The Scholastic name is well known in the education market, well known 
      by parents, and that's part of the appeal," said Sharon Bergen, vice 
      president for education and training at the Knowledge Learning 
      Corporation, which is based in Golden, Colo., and acquired Children's 
      World in May.</P>
      <P>But Mr. Ruskin says he thinks parents are being ill served. "So many 
      parents do grim daily battle with so many of our nation's largest 
      corporations," he said. "Schools should stand on the side of the parents 
      in that battle."</P><p align="center"> Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company </p>
