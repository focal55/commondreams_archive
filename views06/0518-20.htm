<p>I'm getting pretty sick of trying to talk to you people.




<p>Oh, not you personally, I suppose. I'm sure you're a thoughtful,
intelligent, generous, worthwhile member of human society, a credit to
yourself and your family's name, and the world is better for your being in
it. For all I know, you may even read books.




<p>I guess it's the great mass of men that frustrates my periodic forays into
dialogue. These would be the same great group of putative sapiens who drove
poor Henry to his cabin in Walden woods, many a monk to a mountaintop, and
Henry Louis Mencken to his typewriter to the enduring delight and
sustenance of lesser practitioners of his sarcastic art such as I.




<p>So here's where I am today, and this is what I have to say and I'll deviate
from my usual route by posting my complaint here boldly, not yet two
hundred words into our proceedings, perhaps thus to snare one or more of
those who habitually quit my longer, more layered excursions in disgust
when no point has risen before their attention spans have timed out.




<p>The National Security Administration (whatever, exactly, that is, and
whomever, precisely, it answers to, and however many hundreds of millions
of dollars it gets from those few of us earning under a hundred thousand
dollars a year and thus paying any taxes at all) has a list of all the
telephone calls you make and of all the calls you receive. This includes
the messages from your mistress and from the married man you met in a
sports bar in Portland one winter night to test out your feeling that you
might be "bi-curious". They know about your son's calls from jail, your
daughter's pregnancy and VD scares, the flurry of communications between
you and the "Financial Management Expert" that led to your purchase of
several embarrassing stocks, as well as the several calls just before April
fifteenth in which you sought advice from anyone who would listen as to how
you might turn a year's foolish investments into a dubious tax advantage.




<p>They know, or could know, if they cared to sift through the interminable
boredom of your average existence, that you suffer from varicose veins,
hemorrhoids, insufficiency of erection, obesity (some connection, there,
perhaps, to the limpness issue?) a chronic cough, dribbling after urination
coupled with a perverse tardiness in initiating flow.




<p>A guy in a suit or a uniform (is the NSA military, civilian, bureaucratic,
or all three?), or maybe a young woman in a lab coat, (or do they outsource
data management to India?) might have a list of the times you've been
badgered by collection agencies. Or loan sharks. Or your father-in-law, fed
up with your inability to keep a decent roof over his daughter's head or
maintain a steady job.




<p>They know, I suppose, if you've lied to the unemployment office, the IRS,
your clergyman. They know that you regularly refuse contribution to human
or animal welfare or environmental or peace charities, or, conversely, that
you're a sucker for any pitch that comes down the pipe. They know you buy
guns. They know you buy dope. They know, if they're listening, just how
much of a dope you can sometimes be. We all can be. They know.




<p>But they're only collecting data. They don't care about content, just
connections. As long as you're not calling Al-Qaida, you're fine. You have
nothing to hide. They're only keeping you safe. Keeping us all safe.
Keeping America safe. Everything is different since 9/11. The world is a
dangerous place, brimming with Haters-Of-Freedom. In the War Against Terror
we have to sacrifice a few freedoms to stay free.




<p>Early polls indicate that two out of three Americans don't object to the
NSA keeping track of their phone calls, to whom, from whom, what time, how
long. See the preceding paragraph for a typical list of explanations and
apologies.




<p>To which I can only cry the following. Only a list of numbers? Maybe. So
what. It's still too much authority too deep into our lives. They wouldn't
violate your privacy? Bullshit. The persons who've captured our country
while we were skiing or golfing or watching television or standing in line
at Disney World or bargain hunting at Wal Mart will violate your privacy
every time they think they might thus accrue some advantage to the estates
of wealth or power. If you fight it they'll put you on a midnight plane to
Morocco for a conversation with some guys who know how to work a magneto, a
machete, a bucket of ice water, or a Glock.




<p>Nobody ever went wrong mistrusting concentrations of power. In this country
today power has pooled in the moneyed interests (corporations, insurance
companies, investment banks, oil companies, billionaires), fundamental,
backward, anti-intellectual, medieval religion (every loud, idiotic,
crackpot blow-hard you've ever seen on TV praising God and asking you to
pass the wherewithal, not to mention your born-again president), and in the
truly twisted connivers, industry-shills, money-men and soulless creeps
who've turned our professional military to foul purposes. Among these are
chiefly Don Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice and Dick Cheney. Two thirds of us are
comfortable with this crowd running the country and spying on its citizens.




<p>Nothing will come of this little essay except a couple E-mails reminding me
that I wouldn't be free to write it if I lived in Iraq under the iron rule
of Saddam Hussein. But at least I'll have said that I don't approve of the
NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the FCC, Homeland Security or anybody else knowing
one bit more about my life than necessary to extract my taxes, restrict my
driving to a safe speed, and keep me from pouring used motor oil into my
tributary of the Sheepscot River.




<p>Two out of three Americans, polls show, are out to lunch, asleep at the
switch, ignorant of history, and likely to be very surprised and very
unhappy when the knock in the night comes for them, rather than for the Jew
in the ghetto, the Arab in the city, the wetback, the uppity black, the
bums in the streets, the agitators, the misfits, the problem children. It
was long ago and it was far away, and for some of you it hit before your
mother was born, but it was Four Dead In Ohio, and America was killing its
own right here at home, and too little too late, but we once threw out a
bad president and a corrupt administration. Those guys were bad. These guys
are worse.




<p>Two out of three Americans don't mind having their phone calls collected.
How do they stand on having their mail read? What's next? How far will it
go? How long will it last? Have we let it go to far to get it back?




<p>Did I mention Mencken? Try him, if you haven't. He's better than TV. Better
than the New York Times. He said, "I believe that all government is evil,
in that all government must necessarily make war upon liberty." Good
government goes bad. Bad men corrupt good government. Even in America, Even
now. Even as we sleep.




<p>True enough, but it sounds pretty bad to say it so. Men like Mencken and
those others of us who use whatever small forum we are granted to shine
some reason and decency into the ignored or concealed corners of our
collective lives are often dismissed as being negative while enjoying life
in "The Greatest Country In The World." But Negativity, as Bob Dylan
reminded us, won't always pull you through. We spit and fight and fulminate
and argue and cry, cry, cry because we are fundamentally hopeful and
optimistic and we hurt so much to see great promise and decency corrupted,
subverted, dragged low.




<p>Mencken will close today's thoughts:

<p>I believe that it is better to tell the truth than to lie.

<p>I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave.

<p>And I believe that it is better to know than be ignorant.
