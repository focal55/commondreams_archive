Since first releasing<font color="#FF33CC"> "If It Were Up to Me"</font> to radio 
stations in January, Rounder Records has used Cheryl Wheeler's powerful song to 
raise money for and draw attention to the campaign against handgun violence.<br>
<br>
                                    Rounder Records pledged $5 to the Center to 
                                    Prevent Handgun Violence each time AAA radio 
                                    stations played the song. Rounder is also 
                                    donating a portion of the proceeds from Cheryl's 
                                    album, Sylvia Hotel, to the Center. Just last 
                                    week, Cheryl Wheeler and Rounder presented 
                                    an initial check for $1,200 to the <a href="http://www.cphv.org/">Center 
                                    to Prevent Handgun Violence</a> in Washington, 
                                    D.C.<br>
<br>
Sadly, the mass shooting in Colorado has returned this tragic issue to the headlines 
once again. Many radio stations across the country are playing the song in response 
to the tragedy, including KACD in Los Angeles and KBCO in Boulder, Colorado.<br>
<br>
KBCO received such a strong response from their listeners that they have been 
playing the song every two hours. </font></p>
