Vs.<br>
Women's Soccer Champs and X-Gamers</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
By Tom Turnipseed<br>
July 13, 1999</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some moss-backed sports 
traditionalists, from naysaying newspaper sports columnists to the macho men of 
sports talk radio, are freaking out over the prodigious popularity of the World 
Cup Champion US Women's Soccer Team and even the not-as-popular but interesting 
X-Games. Too many of the masculine men of sports media have a rather non-inclusive 
bias against nice young women soccer players and skinny boys in baggy-britches 
on skate-boards who are capturing the public's fancy and daring to dominate in 
their domain of over-paid giants and gladiators.<br>
<br>
They whine that the "momentary popularity" is due to a summer lull in traditional 
sports action, but mid-summer is All-Star Game time for the "Great American Pastime" 
of baseball, and the time when the world's biggest golf and tennis tournaments 
are played. The record-breaking TV ratings and public attention of women's soccer 
and the interest in the X-Games on television are a tribute to the attractive 
young women on our World Cup Team whose skill, teamwork, and determination allows 
them to make soccer plays in international competition that put their male counterparts 
to shame and to the minute misfits on skateboards in X-Game competition whose 
athleticism, courage and innovation level is higher than that of an NFL offensive 
lineman.<br>
<br>
Most of the mossbacks come from an era pre-dating Title IX that gave a federal 
mandate to schools who received federal funds to provide equal opportunity for 
women in their athletic programs including athletic scholarships. Many major football 
coaches and athletic directors and their universities spent big bucks resisting 
its application in lawsuits contending that Title IX would ruin big-time college 
sports. The macho men of the sports media moaned the same sexist song of gloom 
and doom that funds from big revenue producing college sports like football would 
be drained by non revenue producing women's sports like soccer and cause disaster 
in the overall athletic program. Interestingly, they failed to mention the money-gobbling 
budgets of big-time football which have been known to run deficits.<br>
<br>
With Women's World Cup Soccer filling up major stadiums throughout the United 
States culminating in a 90,000 plus sellout at premium prices in the finals in 
the Rose Bowl and the highest U.S. TV ratings ever for any kind of soccer, its 
no wonder that the sports dinosaurs' desperate diatribes about "short-lived popularity" 
and "unobjective media hype" have reached a crescendo. Then there's the phenomenal 
success of women's college soccer at schools like the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill who substantially out draw men's soccer in attendance and women's 
basketball at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville that averages 17,000 fans 
a game. So Title IX has finally brought the macho mossbacks of the media kicking 
and screaming into the new millennium of major media women's sports.<br>
<br>
Then there's the no-place-to-go-but-out-of- the-limelight argument because America 
loves sports heroes who play a regular schedule and all there is for women's soccer 
is the Olympics and the World Cup competition every two years. The traditionalists 
say that since men's professional soccer's attendance and ratings are stagnant 
a women's league would fail. They are also the same folks who say that U.S. fans 
don't like soccer because there is not enough scoring and therefore its boring. 
The main reason that soccer has been slow to catch on with high ratings and revenues 
is that the U.S. Fans cannot stand to lose, particularly to small nations where 
soccer is the national pastime. In recent years when the U.S. men's team began 
to win a few games the ratings went up. The U.S. Men's professional league is 
not as good as several other leagues in the world, which pretty much mirrors the 
U.S. National Team's global performance , but our Women's National Team is the 
best and a U.S. Women's professional league would be the best in the world.<br>
<br>
Finally, the macho media mossbacks need to relax and understand that everyone 
can be included in our wonderfully diverse world of media proliferation and niche 
sports and new markets. Just because they might remember and revere the era of 
3 or 4 TV channels that carried only baseball, football, and basketball along 
with a bit of boxing and wrestling, doesn't put their manhood in jeopardy if millions 
of us get excited and become rabid fans of our Women's World Cup Champions or 
even the pint-sized skateboarders who compete in the X-Games.</font></p>
