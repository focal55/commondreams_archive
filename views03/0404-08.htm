<p>It is really great to see all of you here today, willing to spend an 
entire day at this very difficult time looking at some of the root 
causes of the many problems that we see around us. Before we hear from 
our keynote speaker, John Nichols, who's going to help us make some 
connections between the power of corporations and some of those 
problems, I'm going to talk about some of the legal history of 
corporations and how they came to have so much power.
<p>The analysis I'm about to give you comes from the Program on 
Corporations, Law and Democracy, a think tank whose members have been 
researching, writing and doing workshops about corporate rule for the 
last 15 years. I've been privileged to attend several of these, 
including a week-long training just a year ago. POCLAD has collaborated 
with WILPF, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, to 
develop a study circle course on the history of corporate power, a 
national campaign to abolish corporate personhood, which you'll hear 
more about later today, and an upcoming Democracy Caravan which plans to
take education about corporate rule on the road later this year.

<p>POCLAD and WILPF would like to reframe the way we think about corporate 
power and the role that corporations play in our society. We have, over 
time, come to accept that corporations are a given, that they must be 
powerful, and that in their pursuit of profits they will do many things 
we don't like -- things that are harmful to the Earth and human health, 
like emitting toxic poisons, things that are inhumane, like exploiting 
workers, and things that are destructive of communities, like closing 
plants and laying off thousands of people. We usually don't even 
consider whether we could challenge their right to do these things. 
Instead, we define our role as citizens as trying to curb these 
destructive impulses -- to say, you can only pollute this much, you have
to pay workers at least this much, and have this minimum of safety 
standards. When they don't, we try to pass more laws, enforce them 
better, or put citizen pressure on corporations through boycotts, 
letters to the editor, or moral persuasion.

<p>In resigning ourselves to the belief that we have to let corporations 
define their role in society, and try what we can do to make them 
"behave" better, we have in effect turned over our authority as 
self-governing people to corporate owners. We are allowing our democracy
to vanish.

<p>In doing research into the history of corporate rule, the members of 
POCLAD discovered something that most people today find quite 
surprising. In the early days of the United States, right after the 
American Revolution, corporations did not have power. People back then 
saw the corporation as a tool that existed to accomplish something for 
the public good. It had no inherent right to exist, or to do anything 
outside of what the people wanted it to do. Corporations were granted 
charters by the people, through their elected representatives in the 
state legislatures. And those charters had sunset dates, usually 
somewhere between five and 30 years. At that time the corporation would 
automatically dissolve unless its charter was renewed by an act of the 
legislature. Sometimes they were dissolved before their charter sunset 
date. This could happen if they exceeded the authority granted to them 
in their charter, or if they failed to fulfill their purpose -- or for 
no reason all. And many did lose their charters. Here's an example. This
is from the ruling in a case against the North River Sugar Refining 
Corporation by the New York State Court of Appeals, Justice Finch, in 1890.

<p>"The judgment sought against the defendant is one of corporate death.The
life of a corporation is, indeed, less than that of the humblest 
citizen.Corporations may, and often do, exceed their authority only 
where private rights are affected. When these are adjusted, all mischief
ends and all harm is averted. But when the transgression has a wider 
scope, and threatens the welfare of the people, they may summon the 
offender to answer for the abuse of its franchise or the violation of 
its corporate duty. The [North River Sugar Refining] coporation has 
violated its charter, and failed in the performance of its corporate 
duties, and that in respects so material and important to justify a 
judgment of dissolution.All concur."

<p>The people didn't take North River Sugar Refining Corporation to court 
to get it fined. They took it to court to dissolve it. Corporate death.

<p>And besides having a limited lifespan, corporations were limited in many
other ways. They were not allowed to own property other than what they 
needed for their purpose. They were not allowed to give campaign 
donations or to lobby legislatures or Congress. They were not allowed to
give charitable donations. Their owners, including stockholders, were 
personally liable for the debts and harms of the corporation. All of 
their records were public. They weren't allowed to buy or sell each 
other, or to have interlocking boards of directors. Violation of these 
could result in charter revocation--corporate death.

<p>Restrictions like these were put into the state laws because the people 
who lived in the British colonies -- the wealthy and the poor both -- 
had had enough of the abusive rule of corporations by 1776. Crown 
corporations formed during the colonial period existed to exploit 
resources and dominate commerce in various products, such as tea or 
spices. They also founded and ruled colonies--Virginia, Carolina, 
Maryland, and others. Their authority to govern was in their charters. 
In 1776, the colonists rebelled against King George as king -- and King 
George as CEO.

<p>With this experience, the framers of the federal and state constitutions
were careful to keep the chartering of corporations at the state level, 
where it would be closer to the people, and to include the list of 
restrictions I read earlier, and many others, to make sure corporations 
had no power, and particularly not the power to govern. They were, in a 
sense, going against the historical trend of corporate power up until 
then -- of the use of the corporate form as a way of pooling investments
and organizing business activity while protecting the individual 
investors from liability. The corporation has a long history as a form 
of business organization -- and a long history of being used by wealthy 
people to accumulate more wealth and power. Many of the people making 
decisions in the new nation in the late 18th century wanted to change 
this, to make the corporation serve the people in keeping with the 
principles of democracy that shaped the governing documents of the U.S. 
-- ideas from the French Enlightenment, as well as from Native American 
governance such as the Iroquois Confederacy.

<p>I want to take a slight detour here and say just one or two things about
the U.S. Constitution, and the people who wrote it and adopted it. In 
those days, "we the people" meant white males with property -- less than
10 percent of the population. The rest were not considered competent to 
govern. John Jay, one of the framers, has a famous quote: "The people 
who own the country ought to govern it." Alexander Hamilton: "The people
are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give 
therefore to the first class a distinct, permanent share in the 
government." We think of the U.S. Constitution as a document that 
protects our rights, and it is, but it also protects property and the 
people who own it. My point is that the Constitution is not a sacred 
text, and we shouldn't be starry-eyed about it. When it was written and 
adopted, it primarily served the needs and interests of the small class 
of propertied white men who were considered "people." Nevertheless, its 
principles, particularly those embodied in the Bill of Rights, are 
valuable and strong, and the proof is that they have stood up to being 
stretched and expanded again and again. Even though most people were not
legal persons in 1787, they took to heart that phrase "we the people," 
and thought it ought to include them, and began a heroic and 
still-unfinished struggle to extend the rights and freedoms guaranteed 
in the Constitution to all people.

<p>And even though the people in these social movements like abolition, 
women's suffrage, labor, mostly were people who had not yet gained 
recognition as persons, they knew that the rights and protections in the
Constitution were for people, not for corporations. They knew that 
corporations were tools, with no inherent right to exist but only the 
privilege to serve the public good as long as their charters lasted or 
as long as they continued to do something useful. To them, corporations 
were by definition subordinate to the people, all the people--even those
who weren't yet "people."

<p>In other words, the corporation was a tool. Like a toaster. Created to 
fulfill a particular function. The people of those times, both the 
framers and ordinary folks, would have been appalled by the idea that a 
corporation could have constitutionally protected rights. Not only would
this be a direct contradiction of democratic principles -- but a 
complete absurdity. Imagine a toaster having constitutional rights!

<p>What do you do when your toaster doesn't toast the way it's supposed to?

<p>Do you lobby the legislature to pass a law requiring it to toast 
properly? Do you sue your toaster, boycott it, beg it to behave, 
negotiate with it? Of course not--it's absurd to think of doing such 
things. Our ancestors in the 19th century would find it just as absurd 
that we try to deal with corporate harms in these ways. We don't treat 
destructive corporations as broken tools, and fix them--or discard them.

<p>We have learned to accept, however reluctantly, that we must try to 
persuade them to be less destructive, but we can't demand that they do 
what we want them to do. We have forgotten that they once were the 
people's tools, with no right to exist and certainly no right to do any 
amount of harm.

<p>Even though strong sentiment existed after the American Revolution to 
keep corporations from becoming powerful, the ink was hardly dry on the 
Constitution before the corporate owners were looking for ways to do 
just that. Through the legal system, they sought reinterpretation of 
contract law in their favor. Through corrupt state legislatures, they 
got many charter restrictions removed. And through taking opportunistic 
advantage of the crisis created by the Civil War and the political 
corruption that followed it, they consolidated significant political and
economic power by the mid-1860s.

<p>But they were still subordinate to the people, still subject to 
democratic control. They continued to look for a way out of this, and 
they saw their big opportunity in 1868, when the 14th amendment was 
passed prohibiting any state from denying equal protection and due 
process of law to any person. This was, of course, added to the 
Constitution to protect the rights of freed slaves. The corporate 
attorneys immediately began to bring cases seeking to have corporations 
designated as persons protected by this amendment. It took several 
tries, but in 1886, a federal court in California ruled in the case of 
Santa Clara County vs. the Southern Pacific Railroad that corporations 
were persons under the law. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and 
did not rule on personhood, but a court clerk who was a railroad 
shareholder (as were some of the California judges), added language to 
the case header stating that the justices did not rule on whether 
corporations are persons because they were already of the opinion that 
they were.

<p>This precedent, illegitimate as it was, opened the way for a flood of 
cases cementing corporate personhood on every level. In the last two 
decades of the 19th century, the 14th amendment was used less than 20 
times to protect the rights of formerly enslaved persons. It was used 
almost 300 times to secure personhood rights for corporations. This was 
before the majority of human beings had full personhood --women got the 
vote in 1920, native Americans in the 1930s, and African-Americans, 
though technically persons after 1868, were not able to claim their 
rights until the past 40 years and arguably they still can't.

<p>After this, through more cases, the corporate attorneys won for 
corporations all the specific rights in the Bill of Rights that they 
wanted--most importantly, due process, free speech and press, and 
protection from search and seizure. They achieved the protection for 
their commercial speech and advertising, as well as campaign donations, 
as first amendment rights. They also secured the right not to speak, not
to say what they didn't want to say, such as an energy company not being
required to put conservation information in with its bills. Right now 
they are seeking the right to lie in a case about Nike Corporation being
heard very soon in the Supreme Court. They stopped surprise visits by 
government regulators such as the EPA or OSHA by claiming protection 
from search and seizure without due process. Of course, by the time the 
inspectors arrive with a warrant, everything's just fine.
<p>These protections that corporations have achieved through their status 
as legal persons exercising individual rights are definitely outrageous,
and it's easy to see how they violate democracy. But it gets worse. The 
reason I used the phrase "corporate rule" is because corporations don't 
just have too much power -- they have de facto governing authority 
through these rights that they claim under the Constitution. This is not
an explicit governing authority such as what the crown corporations had.

<p>Rather it is what results when corporations are accorded rights intended
for you and me, and are given a place and a voice in the political system.

<p>Primarily through the rights of due process and equal protection, 
corporate owners and attorneys have succeeded in defining almost 
everything corporations have and do, including non-tangible things like 
their ideas and their decisions, as property, protected by these rights.

<p>Giant corporation owners make decisions that create the conditions of 
our lives, that establish how we will do things, that determine what 
choices we will have both in the marketplace and in terms of things like
jobs, entertainment, food, information. Here are some of the corporate 
decisions that are private property and "none of our business."

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> The owners of corporations decide what to produce-- things like sugary

drinks and Lunchables, things like nuclear warheads and instruments of 
torture, violent video games and toys made of PVC.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> These same people decide how to produce those products--with toxic 
chemicals, with huge amounts of fresh water, paying their workers as 
little as possible.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> It is a business decision, made by this same small group of owners, 
how they will treat workers--denying their civil rights in the 
workplace, paying them less than a living wage, requiring mandatory 
overtime.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> These same people making business decisions create the jobs available 
in the economy-- service jobs with low pay, factory work in dangerous 
conditions, construction jobs using scarce resources.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> It's a business decision for these same people to determine how food 
is produced -- food sprayed with poison pesticides is called 
"conventional," even though no food was grown that way for all of human 
history until the last 70 years.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> These same people make business decisions about our transportation 
system --undoubtedly you've heard about how the auto-related companies 
bought up the trolley systems that served many US cities including 
Minneapolis, tore out the tracks and burned the cars so we'd have to buy
their autos, and car company executives are still deciding to make and 
market gas-guzzling vehicles, and are still keeping efficient 
technologies on the shelf--it's a business decision.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> The same group of corporate decisionmakers are allowed to determine, 
as a business decision, what new enterprises can get loans--it's easy 
for a giant corporation, not so for a small business person who doesn't 
have collateral, or who plans to do something that this group of owners 
wishes to discourage.

<p><img src="../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> It's also a corporate business decision, made by this handful of 
people, what information we will have access to -- what is "news," what 
songs get played on the radio, what books are published.

<p>None of this is any of our business.

<p>Now, we are so used to this, it may seem like, sure, business owners 
have to make decisions about their operations, what they make, how they 
make it, how their business runs. We can't be making all those 
decisions. Yes, these are business decisions. But they are also 
governing decisions. They are decisions that create the structures of 
our common life, the parameters within which we must live, as well as 
making choices for us about use of resources that are our common 
heritage, use of public space that is our social commons, restricting 
information, the lifeblood of democracy, and generating pollution that 
we all must live with and pay to clean up.

<p>From the founding of the nation for more than a century, ordinary 
people knew that the owners of corporations should not be allowed to 
make such decisions for society. In the 1880s, the farmers of the 
Farmers Alliance wanted to free themselves from the cycle of increasing 
debt to the company store, which they were forced to rely on for seed 
and tools and to sell their cotton. The merchants charged a lot for seed
and paid little for the cotton. So the farmers began to set up 
cooperatives, but they needed a whole network of them to make their 
vision work. The corporate bankers closed ranks and would not lend money
to establish something that they could see would reduce the hold of 
corporations on the economy. Those farmers, dirt-poor and without formal
education, knew that it was undemocratic, against the principles of the 
nation, for the corporate banks to refuse them, so they developed a plan
for a parallel banking system. Of course, this also failed. By then the 
corporations were too strong, and the farmers were too poor, and they 
weren't able to build enough solidarity with urban workers to challenge 
the corporations for control of the economy.

<p>The populist movement, which grew out of the farmers alliance and had 
some electoral success for a few years, was the largest democracy 
movement in American history, a movement of millions of people who still
understood that corporations were meant to serve the people, not the 
other way around. As the populist movement faded, the Progressives rose 
and established the regulatory system which we have relied on for a 
hundred years to keep corporate power under control. Has it worked?

<p>The premise of the regulatory system is that corporations cannot be 
required to act in the public good, but only to comply with specific 
laws. The regulatory system allows corporations as much free rein as 
possible, as long as they don't behave too badly, produce too much 
pollution, or be too hard on their workers. Only if a corporation is 
violating a law can regulatory pressure be applied, which means there 
must be laws passed about each thing that corporations might do that is 
harmful. They can't be regulated for, for example, destroying a 
community and creating homelessness by moving a manufacturing plant to 
another country and leaving thousands of people out of work. There's no 
law against that, and there can't be such a law. If a toxic chemical 
isn't regulated -- risk assessment hasn't been done, safety standards 
haven't been established -- then no corporation can be penalized for 
emitting it. Out of the over 80,000 chemicals now in use, less than 30 
percent have even been tested for toxicity or carcinogenicity. The other
56,000 in effect aren't regulated.

<p>The Progressives did manage, through establishing regulation, to limit 
some of the worst of corporate activities in the early 20th century, 
price gouging and such. But they also succeeded in helping people to 
forget that corporations started out as tools, and that they are 
supposed to serve the public good. Regulation effectively made routine 
and legal a huge amount of harm done by corporations. The Progressives, 
although their legacy is a word that has a positive meaning today for 
people who work for social change, did great harm to democracy by 
putting an end to efforts of people like the populists to keep 
corporations subordinate, and by substituting regulatory penalties like 
fines for penalties like corporate death. These changes in how corporate
harms were dealt with added the final touch to corporate owners' 
century-long efforts to get out from under the people's control, and 
finished off our last shreds of sovereignty while helping to create our 
20th-century belief that the best we can hope for is to prevent 
corporations' worst offenses while we submit to being ruled by them.

<p>The world has changed a great deal since corporations began to rule. We 
can't, and don't want to, "go back." At the time corporations gained 
personhood, most humans still weren't persons. Even though people in the
1880s understood the true nature of corporations in spite of the legal 
maneuvering that made them persons, most weren't able to participate as 
sovereign people in the system of self-government set up in the US 
Constitution.

<p>And so we don't know how the amazing and rapid industrialization and 
technological progress of the last two centuries would have been 
different if "we the people" had been in charge, making careful 
decisions about how to manage the new developments for the common good, 
meet everyone's needs and preserve the commons for the benefit of all. 
How we the people might have used the corporations as tools for progress
we defined, rather than allowing their owners to direct it for their 
benefit.

<p>We can't go back; but we can learn from our ancestors as we determine 
how to go forward.

<p>We must learn from them to look at corporations a different way, not 
through the lens of regulation, but through the lens of sovereignty. We 
must learn again what the poor farmers of the Farmers Alliance knew: We 
are sovereign. We the people govern. Corporations are our creations and 
exist at our say-so. Defining the conditions of their existence is our 
job, not theirs--and defining the conditions of our existence is also 
our job, not theirs.

<p>What if we the people really were in charge, and corporations were our 
tools to build and operate the kind of world we want to live in? When 
polls show that 80 percent of people in this country want stronger 
environmental laws, significant percentages would like to avoid buying 
items made in sweatshops and large numbers support the international 
declaration on human rights, it's evident that we the people would 
design a much more sustainable and humane society than the one being 
designed for us by the owners and managers of corporations.

<p>I'm going to leave you with some questions to ponder as you listen to 
John and attend the rest of the sessions today. What would it mean for 
us to stop trying to deal with corporations' harms through regulation, 
stop acknowledging their claims to personhood and individual rights, 
stop allowing them to rule over us? What would it look like for us to 
take up our sovereignty, make governing decisions ourselves and instruct
our corporate creations how we want those decisions carried out? What 
would be different if we recovered our vanishing democracy and became 
for real, maybe for the first time, a self-governing people?
