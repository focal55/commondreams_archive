<p>As an Iraqi civilian, and after being through this
war, and after listening to all that has been said and
done, I want everyone to know that this war has just
begun. This isn’t the end. And everyone should know
that the Iraqi people are ready to sacrifice their
lives for Iraq, and only for Iraq – not for Saddam,
and not for the Americans.

<p>For years, most people have seen Iraq only through
Saddam We always tried to make people see them as two
different things, but it was too hard. Now that Saddam
is no more, the question is—what will the world see
now? 

<p>The United States said, or to be more precise—George
Bush said that they will enter Iraq as liberators not
as occupiers, and that they are here to eliminate an
aggressive regime, to destroy the weapons of mass
destruction, to offer the Iraqi people freedom and
independence, and to help Iraq regain a respected
place in the world. But will Iraq be just another
American State? 

<p>From my place now we are not even respected in our own
land. We don’t have the right to say anything about
what the Americans are doing. They hold the machine
guns, and we don’t. Is this the new, George Bush
democracy? 

<p>We are calling for democracy. We want our voices to go
out to the world with no fear. But that is not
possible because we are not free. We are not free to
move, especially at night. We are not allowed to film
near any U.S. military (just like with Saddam!).
Al-Jazeera TV was threatened and accused that they
were not showing the right (American) viewpoint, and
their live pictures of the war were not true, and so
their office got bombed and one of their reporters
were murdered because the American government was not
pleased with their programs. Is this the new, George
Bush democracy? 

<p>Voices in the Wilderness was stopped from working at
the Palestine hotel because they did some writing that
showed part of this reality. So they had to be
stopped. So where is the democracy? Where is the
freedom?

<p>We don’t even have the right to protect ourselves and
our families. We see looting and crimes that are
committed, and we can’t stop them. We can’t even say
“no” to anything the American soldiers are doing, even
if it is illegal.

<p>For example, the weapons that they find now, in the
city, they are destroying them in the middle of
Baghdad – in the city where children, women, and men
live, with no concern for what it might do to the
properties of the people, and some of our people have
lost their lives and houses because of those
destructions. They don’t have any other place to live.
Who is responsible for that?

<p>In addition to that, the pollution that these
destructions are causing to the environment, and the
diseases that might appear because of no clean water,
and not enough medicines, these things threaten all of
us.

<p>Who is in charge of this? Who is responsible for all
these crimes? Or this the new, George Bush democracy,
where no one can say, “No!”?

<p><i>Hamsa Mohammed is a 22 year old Iraqi college student
at Baghdad University, and captain of the women’s
volleyball team. She hopes to be a writer.
