<p>When the President of the United States speaks, we assume the words coming 
from his mouth are his, or if not of his invention, at least of his 
adoption. We expect the president to take ownership of the speeches written 
for him, to have a concrete grasp of their content, that by speaking the

words publicly, he endorses that content and holds himself accountable for 
the substance of what he's saying.

<p>This expectation is all too reasonable when we consider the alternative,

that we view the president as simply a mouthpiece and puppet for others 
inside and outside the White House who actually conceive, create and dictate 
policy. The suggestion is absurd and laughable, of course, so let's return 
to the premise that the president thinks and speaks for himself.

<p>Until now, the White House under George W. Bush has gone to great lengths to 
convince the public this is so. The Bush administration expressed outrage in 
March 2002 when word leaked that it wasn't the president, but speechwriter 
David Frum, who coined the term "axis of evil" and fed it into the 
president's famed address. Soon after, Frum lost his job.

<p>So it was astonishing, yet hardly surprising, to see the manner in which

Bush and his administration handled the blowback from the revelation that, 
contrary to Bush's assertion in a State of the Union address leading up to 
war, Iraq never attempted to acquire uranium from Africa for a nuclear 
weapons program.

<p>While higher-ups in the administration fretted publicly, and uniformly, how 
such bogus intelligence found its way into the president's speech, the 
president himself remained conspicuously mute and distanced from the issue. 
Only after CIA director George Tenet became the fall guy did the president 
speak at all about the controversy, and only then in a deflective expression 
of benevolence ("I've got confidence in George Tenet") and with a dismissive 
wave that he considers the matter closed (Did he ever acknowledge it as 
open?).

<p>On Monday, Bush assessed the intelligence he received from the CIA as "darn 
good," which falls somewhere between "really good" and "sorta good" and, if 
we're to take the president at his word, indicates the intelligence 
certainly wasn't of the "extremely good" variety Americans would have 
demanded as a prerequisite for war.

<p>While many inside and outside Congress are demanding a full investigation of 
what the president knew and when he knew it, Congress should instead probe 
whether the president ever knows what he's saying.

<p>There are a number of books and Web sites dedicated to documenting the 
verbal mix-ups, miscues and muddled messages that fall from Bush's mouth like 
oats from a horse's maw. One of the most thorough and best-organized of the 
Web sites is <a href="http://www.dubyaspeak.com" target="_new">dubyaspeak.com</a> (Motto: "We record the damage"), where the 
president's oratory mistakes have piled so high, site organizers have 
divided them into more than a dozen categories (war, economy, education,

himself, etc.).

<p>Certainly, there's much to laugh at here. But as one combs through the site, 
revealing layer upon layer of befuddlement, the humor gives way to 
head-shaking disbelief and the quiet fright of a deepened understanding of 
this president's intellectual incapacity.

<p>Along with dozens of simple grammatical gaffes are more serious 
contradictions, misleading and erroneous statements presented as truth and 
sentences so confusing they defy deciphering.

<p>The president, who expressed ironclad certainty in the lead-up to war that 
Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, on June 9 of this year indicated 
his certainty was far less than concrete when he said this in Washington, 
D.C.: "I am absolutely convinced, with time, we'll find out that they did 
have a weapons program." Had he said this in his State of the Union address, 
far fewer Americans would have supported the war.

<p>Bush certainly had the welfare of American troops in Iraq close to his heart 
on July 2, when the cowboy unleashed this: "There are some who feel that the 
conditions are such that they can attack us there. My answer is 'Bring 'em 
on!' " The killing and wounding of American soldiers continues unabated.

<p>Anyone wondering how half of Americans came to believe Saddam Hussein was 
connected with the September 11 terrorist attacks need only blame Bush for 
the perceived link.

<p>First, there were statements such as this from the president, on Sept. 28, 
2002, describing Saddam Hussein to an audience in Phoenix, Ariz., as "a man 
which hates -- who hates America, a man who loves to link up with al Qaeda, 
a man who is a true threat to America, to Israel, to anybody in the 
neighborhood."

<p>In his prime time press conference of March 6, 2003, Bush addressed a 
question regarding the risks of going to war with Iraq in this way: "The

price of doing nothing exceeds the price of taking action, if we have to. 
We'll do everything we can to minimize the loss of life. The price of the 
attacks on America, the cost of the attacks on America on September the 11th 
were enormous. They were significant."

<p>People wondering about Bush's involvement in foreign policy won't find any 
comfort with this July 3 preview of his recent trip to Africa: "We'll be

going to Goree Island, where I'll be giving a speech about race, race in the 
world, race as it relates to Africa and America. And we're in the process of 
writing it. I can't give you any highlights of the speech yet because I,

frankly, haven't seen it."

<p>Here's Bush's understanding of the economy, from an address in Canton, Ohio; 
April 24, 2003: "We had an emergency and a recession, which affected the

revenue growth of the U.S. Treasury. I mean, the stock market went down.

<p>Some of the pie-in-the-sky projections didn't make, and the investors said 
'Oops.' The numbers weren't real. The investors said, 'Well, it looks like 
the days of everything is going up may end.' And so people started selling, 
and the markets went down. That affected the revenues coming into the U.S. 
Treasury. Recession -- negative growth means less revenues. And so, of 
course, we've got a deficit."

<p>These are mere drops in the drool bucket, but they explain the defensive, 
protective instincts of this White House. When contained largely to local 
events that aren't broadcast beyond favorable soundbites, Bush's words are 
free to hit an audience with little scrutiny. People link and take home 
keywords such as "Saddam Hussein," "al Qaeda" and "recession," and suddenly 
the president is fighting terrorism and helping the economy.

<p>Of course, the press, which is more likely to dissect the substance of 
whatever the president says, sees and hears far more run-around from White 
House spokesman Ari Fleischer than it will ever gain in direct Q&A with the 
president. This is no accident - everyone in the White House understands

that the less face time Bush has with reporters, the better.

<p>Focusing on whether the president knowingly presented false information in 
one piece of a State of the Union address unduly narrows the scope of the 
problem (after all, perhaps Bush meant to suggest Iraq sought geraniums, not 
uranium). We expect more from the President of the United States - not only 
in his full understanding of the words he speaks and messages he delivers, 
but in his acceptance of the responsibility for them.

<p>While Congress should investigate the intelligence leading up to both 
September 11 and the war with Iraq, there appears little need to further

investigate the intelligence at the top of our executive branch.
