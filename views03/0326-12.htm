<p>How bad can things get, how fast? Are we already at the point where
literally nothing can derail the war machine? That's exactly what some
powerful media outlets seem to have decided, with predictable effects on
public opinion and policy. In its March 3 issue, <i><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0226-01.htm">Newsweek</a></i><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0226-01.htm"> disclosed</a> that the Bush Administration had deliberately suppressed
information exculpating Iraq--information from the same reliable source
previously cited by the Administration as confirming that Iraq had
developed weapons of mass destruction since the 1991 Gulf War. As
damning as this disclosure was, <i>Newsweek</i> chose to underplay it,
perhaps out of a belief that the Bush Administration's Big Lie
techniques have become so pervasive that another instance of tendentious
truth-twisting is no longer front-page news.</p>
<p>

Here's the background: In the summer of 1995 Saddam's then-son-in-law,
Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel, former minister of Iraq's military industry
and the person in charge of its nuclear/chemical/biological programs, defected and provided what was deemed scrupulously
accurate, detailed accounts of those weapons. Kamel's information has
been cited as central evidence and a key reason for attacking Iraq. In
his February 5 presentation to the UN Security Council, Secretary of
State Colin Powell said: "It took years for Iraq to finally admit that
it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. A single drop of
VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came
out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the
defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law."</p>
<p>

But <i>Newsweek</i>'s John Barry revealed that the Administration had
excised a central component of Kamel's testimony--that he had personal
knowledge that Iraq had "destroyed all its chemical and biological
weapons stocks and the missiles to deliver them." To be sure, Kamel
said, Iraq had not abandoned its WMD ambitions, had retained the design
and engineering details, and was likely to return to production given an
opportunity. But his last information was that Iraq's VX arsenal no
longer existed.</p>
<p>

According to the story, UN inspectors had reasons to hush up this
revelation, as they were trying to bluff Saddam into revealing more. But
what is Powell's excuse for using only half of Kamel's claim? And why
did <i>Newsweek</i> and the rest of the American media make so little of
this major story?</p>
<p>

<i>Newsweek</i> chose to run a short, 500-word item in its "Periscope"
section rather than put the story on the cover or make it the focal
point of a longer article showing that the Bush Administration is
rushing to war for no reason at all.</p>
<p>

I was curious why <i>Newsweek</i> did not think this warranted a more
muscular presentation. Communications director Ken Weine argued that the
mag breaks many of its best stories in short sections like "Periscope,"
citing as an example a brief piece two years ago showing that Sony had
fabricated print movie reviews, a piece, he noted, that garnered
worldwide attention.</p>
<p>

But fake movie reviews flacking dubious entertainment and fake missile
reviews flacking a war in which thousands may die are two different
things entirely, and it is a sad comment on the media that such
comparisons would even be made.</p>
<p>

<i>Newsweek</i>, and Barry in particular, deserve kudos for bringing
this important item to the public's attention at all. But if
<i>Newsweek</i>'s editors had the guts to put something like this on the
cover, with the kind of dramatic headline they use for lesser subjects,
they could really affect the debate. Instead, that issue of
<i>Newsweek</i> featured a cover story on the African-American gender
gap in jobs, education and other areas--a worthy story, but nothing that
could not have waited a week.</p>
<p>

For what it's worth, one insider explained that <i>Newsweek</i> has
changed and no longer tries to shake the earth on major issues of the
day, preferring to tweak the zeitgeist on softer things or muse
elegantly about the "big picture" behind the details.</p>
<p>

Perhaps it's not surprising that other media failed to pick up on the
Kamel story: The big papers and magazines hate to acknowledge they've
been scooped by competitors. Of course, you might think they'd want to
outdo <i>Newsweek</i> with some hard-hitting inquiries of their own.
You'd be wrong. It's not that the American media have ignored
Iraq--obviously, it's been a near-obsession. But in the absence of
intrepid investigative reporting and editorial courage, they smothered
the audience in inconsequential material about the most consequential of
topics.</p>
<p>

The Hussein Kamel revelation is probably the biggest Iraq story to get
punted, but it isn't the only significant example. It's worth noting
that British revelations that the National Security Agency spied on
diplomats representing UN Security Council members during the Iraq
deliberations got a small mention in the <i>Washington Post</i> and
prompted no questions at Bush's press conference. Another revelation,
that a British government employee was arrested for allegedly leaking
this information, which Daniel Ellsberg says is more timely and
potentially more important than his own Pentagon Papers in informing the
public, again got little notice in this country. And the unprecedented
resignations of two career US diplomats over Iraq policy hasn't
generated any noteworthy examinations of how people inside the
government really feel about the race to hostilities.</p>
<p>

Cumulatively, Barry's item on Kamel, the revelation that Colin Powell
was citing a graduate student's thesis as British "intelligence" and a
new revelation that more British "evidence" of Iraqi nuclear arms
development cited by the Administration was (according to weapons
inspectors themselves) fabricated suggest that a monstrous Big Lie is in
process--an effort to construct falsified evidence and to trick this
country and the world.</p>
<p>

How's that for zeitgeist material, <i>Newsweek</i>? </p>
