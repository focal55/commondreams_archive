<p>Forget the condemnations from public interest groups that were directed at the Federal Communications Commission after Monday's 3-2 vote to remove limits on media conglomeration, consolidation and monopoly in communities across the country. 

<p>Consider, instead, what FCC member Jonathan Adelstein said about the rule changes that were made over his strenuous dissent. 

<p>"When this full document is finally made public, I expect it will be torn apart by media experts, academics, consumer groups, activists and, most of all, the American people," argued Adelstein. "They will find it riddled with contradictions, inconsistencies, false assumptions and outcome-driven thinking." 

<p>Rarely are federal commissioners ever so blunt. 

<p>Then again, rarely do federal commissioners ever act in so wrongheaded a manner as the FCC majority did Monday. 

<p>At stake were current rules that prevent the television networks from dramatically expanding their ownership of local television stations, and that prevent one media company from controlling daily newspapers, radio stations, television stations, the cable system and the primary Internet site in the same market. 

<p>Close to 150 members of Congress - from progressives like Wisconsin's Sen. Russ Feingold and Rep. Tammy Baldwin to conservatives like Mississippi's Sen. Trent Lott - told the FCC not to make the changes. They were joined by the broadest coalition of consumer, labor, religious and community groups ever assembled in a debate over media ownership - a coalition ranging from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to the National Organization for Women and the National Rifle Association. "When all of us are united on an issue, then one of two things has happened. Either the earth has spun off its axis and we have all lost our minds or there is universal support for a concept," said conservative Brent Bozell. 

<p>The concept, as explained by Commissioner Michael Copps, is that changing the rules to meet the demands of corporate media giants "empowers America's new media elite with unacceptable levels of influence over the media on which our society and our democracy so heavily depend." In the view of Copps, who joined Adelstein in dissenting from the decision, Monday's vote will lead to "centralization, not localism," "uniformity, not diversity" and "monopoly and oligopoly, not competition." 

<p>In other words, the FCC voted for precisely what Americans do not want, which is a strange tack for a commission that is supposed to defend the public interest. The FCC received more than 750,000 communications from citizens regarding the proposed rule changes, and Copps said that more than 99 percent of these expressed opposition. 

<p>So where do we go from here? Did the corporations and lobbyists - who have spent roughly $2.8 million wining and dining FCC commissioners and staffers in recent years - win it all Monday? 

<p>Not quite. 

<p>Congress has the power to reverse these rule changes. Citizens must prod Feingold, Baldwin and others who told the commission not to make the changes to now take the lead in reasserting the public interest in media ownership debates. 

<p>This "defeat" can yet be a victory. In the weeks prior to the FCC vote, millions of Americans were awakened to the importance of placing controls on the growth of media monopolies. These citizens can, and must, become a new force in American politics, a force that will cause Congress to ensure that media ownership rules protect the public interest, as opposed to the special interests that were protected by the FCC on Monday.
