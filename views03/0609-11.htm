<p>A funny thing happened while following the money trail of the neoconservatives who have hijacked U.S. foreign policy. The path led to a network of financial and intellectual resources that also is dedicated to neoracism.   
<p>

	The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation has been the economic fount for the neoconservative notions of global affairs now ascendant in the Bush administration. According to a report by Media Transparency, from 1995 to 2001 the Milwaukee-based foundation provided about $14.5 million  to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), the think tank most responsible for incubating and nourishing the ideas of the neocon movement.
<p>

	The Bradley Foundation also made grants totaling nearly $1.8 million to help fund the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), the influential group that had urged an invasion of Iraq since its 1997 founding. PNAC, headed by <i>Weekly Standard</i> editor William Kristol, boasts a membership that includes many players in the Bush administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.
<p>

	The Bradley foundation also helped fund Samuel P. Huntington&#8217;s neocon classic <i>The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order,</i> a book that brought the domestic culture wars to the global stage. Hitting a familiar, Eurocentric note, Huntington&#8217;s book argued that the Judeo-Christian &#8220;West&#8221; is the protagonist in an epic struggle of civilizations against the &#8220;other&#8221; (this time the Islamic East). For a group that supposedly has left Marxist thinking behind, these neoconservatives are rigidly dialectic.
<p>

	All of this wouldn&#8217;t much alarm me; after all, the battlefield of ideas is as good a place to fight as any. But then I began to notice other beneficiaries of Bradley&#8217;s largess since 1995, and I found some troubling patterns. The foundation has provided nearly $2 million to the National Association of Scholars, which played a key role in the anti-affirmative action campaign known as the Californian Civil Rights Initiative and regularly questions black-oriented scholarship. It has also given $1.8 million to help fund the Madison Center for Educational Affairs, a group that provides guidance and support for 70 right-wing campus papers across the country.  
<p>

	The Bradley Foundation seems to have a soft spot in its heart for the kind of neoracist ideas that have gained currency in recent years. It has heavily subsidized authors like Charles Murray and Dinesh D&#8217;Souza, whose work on welfare and race has reinforced ancient stereotypes. Murray&#8217;s book Losing Ground argued that poverty is the result of personal failings and thus most government anti-poverty programs should be eliminated.  And his book The Bell Curve (written with Harvard psychologist Richard Herrnstein) argued that poverty is the result of genetic traits of a subclass of human beings. These arguments were deployed to help convince conservative legislators of the futility of affirmative action and other compensatory social programs. After all, if African-Americans are genetically incapable of achieving racial equality, we must rethink the goals of the civil rights movement.
<p>

	David Horowitz, one of neoconservatism&#8217;s most incendiary racial provocateurs, has raked in nearly $4.5 million in grants from the Bradley Foundation for his think tank, the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. Horowitz&#8217;s combative tactics seem designed to ratchet up tensions between blacks and Jews, a theme that seems to be a Bradley favorite. 
<p>

	It&#8217;s clear to me that the Bradley Foundation has forged a link between a neo-imperialist foreign policy and a neoracist domestic policy, and that it provides generous funding to push these views in both realms. And Bradley is just one of other like-minded foundations such as the Koch Family Foundation, the John M. Olin Foundation, the Scaife Family Foundation, and the Adolph Coors Foundation, groups examined in the report &#8220;Buying a Movement: Right Wing Foundations and American Politics,&#8221; by People for the American Way.
<p>

	The link that connects these views is the notion that Western civilization is both the global ideal and the world&#8217;s official arbiter. It&#8217;s an old notion: white supremacy unhinged&#8212;the same notion that justified the original imperialism and slavery. What&#8217;s particularly troubling to me is the lack of domestic concern about this connection. Did the world not reach a consensus on the dangers of racist reasoning and military aggression following World War II?
<p>

	That neocons are galvanized by race is no surprise. One of the founding documents of neoconservatism is Norman Podhoretz&#8217;s 1963 essay &#8220;My Negro Problem&#8212;and Ours.&#8221; In that famous <i>Commentary</i> essay, Podhoretz&#8217;s comments helped create a gap between blacks and Jews that has yet to be bridged. Among other things, he suggested that the solution to America&#8217;s racial problem would be for blacks to accept miscegenation as an unobtrusive form of genocide.
<p>

	Victims of these evils see the link between neo-imperialism and neoracism much more easily than the victimizers. And they fear this axis of evil much more than the one concocted by Bush&#8217;s speech writers. That&#8217;s likely one reason black Americans resisted overwhelming media propaganda and opposed the Iraq invasion. The funding priorities of the Bradley Foundation show those fears are not misplaced.  <img src="/global/images/end.gif" width="8" height="8">
