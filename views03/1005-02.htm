<p>The spin is not holding. Facing two controversies--the Wilson leak 
(click <a 
href="http://thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=982" target="_new"
>here</a> if you have somehow managed to miss this story) and the 
still-MIA WMDs--the White House has been tossing out explanations 
and rhetoric that cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>
<p>
Let's start with the Wilson leak. In the issue coming out October 
6, <i> Newsweek</i> will be reporting that after Bob Novak 
published a July 14 column containing the leak attributed to 
"senior adminsitration officials" that identified former 
Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, as an undercover 
CIA operative, NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell was contacted by 
White House officials who touted the Novak column and encouraged 
her to pursue the story about Wilson's wife. The newsmagazine also 
notes that, according to a source close to Wilson, shortly after 
the leak occurred Bush's senior aide Karl Rove told <i> 
Hardball</i> host Chris Matthews that Wilson's wife was "fair 
game." Matthews told <i> Newsweek</I> that he would not discuss 
any confidential conversation. (He told me the same weeks ago when 
I made a similar inquiry about this chat with Rove.) An anonymous 
source described as familiar with the exchange--presumably Rove or 
someone designated to speak for him--maintained that Rove had only 
said to Matthews it was appropriate to raise questions about her 
role in Wilson's mission to Niger. (In February 2002, Wilson had 
been asked by the CIA to visit Niger to check out allegations 
Iraq had been shopping for uranium there; he did so and reported 
back that the charge was probably untrue. In July, he publicly 
challenged the White House's use of this claim and earned the 
administration's wrath.)</p>
<p>
These disclosures do not reveal who were the original leakers. 
(The Justice Department, at the CIA's request, started out 
investigating the White House; it has widened its probe to include 
the State Department and the Defense Department.) But these new 
details are significant and undercut the White House line on the 
leak. At a White House press briefing, Scott McClellan, Bush's 
press secretary, repeatedly said that Bush and his White House 
took no action after the Novak column was published on July 14 
because the leak was attributed only to anonymous sources. "Are we 
supposed to chase down every anonymous report in the newspaper?" 
McClellan remarked.</p>
<p>
He was arguing that a serious leak attributed to anonymous sources 
was still not serious enough to cause the president to ask, what 
the hell happened? And he made it seem as if the White House just 
ignored the matter. Not so. Mitchell's remark and even the 
Rove-friendly account of the Rove-Matthews conversation are 
evidence the White House tried to further the Plame story--that 
is, to exploit the leak for political gain. Rather than respond by 
trying to determine the source of a leak that possibly violated 
federal law and perhaps undermined national security (<i> The 
Washington Post</i> reported that the leak also blew the cover of 
a 
CIA front company, "potentially expanding the damage caused by the 
original disclosure"), White House officials sought to take 
advantage of it. Spin that, McClellan.</p>
<p>
<i> Newsweek</i> is also disclosing that a National Security 
Council staffer previously worked with Valerie Wilson (nee Plame) 
and was aware of her position at the CIA. McClellan has indicated 
in his press briefings that the White House did not--and has 
not--acted to ascertain the source of the leak. But shouldn't Bush 
or chief of staff Andrew Card (if Card is not one of the leakers) 
have asked this person whether he mentioned Valerie Wilson's 
occupation to anyone in the White House? (I believe I know the 
name of this person but since he or she may be working under cover 
I am not at this point going to publish it.)</p>
<p>
McClellan has had a tough time providing straight answers. At the 
October 1 press briefing, he was asked what Bush did after the 
leak first appeared. He replied by saying that "some news reports" 
have noted that Valerie Wilson's CIA connection "may have been 
well-known within the DC community." That hardly seems so. Her 
neighbors did not know, and Wilson maintains their close friends 
did not know. No reporter that I have talked to--and I've spoken to 
many covering this story--had heard that.</p>
<p>
During that briefing, reporters wondered if Bush approved of the 
Republican campaign to depict Wilson as a partisan zealot lacking 
credibility. McClellan sidestepped: "The President is focused on 
getting to the bottom of this." The next day, he was once more 
asked whether it was appropriate for Republicans to be attacking 
Wilson. "I answered that question yesterday," he said. One 
problem: he hadn't. He also maintained that Bush "has been the one 
speaking out front on this." Not quite. For over two months, Bush 
had said nothing about the leak. And on this day, Bush met with 
reporters for African news organizations and joked about the 
anti-Wilson leak. When asked what he thought about the detention 
in Kenya of three journalists who had refused to reveal sources, 
he said, "I'm against leaks." This prompted laughter, and Bush 
went on: "I would suggest all governments get to the bottom of 
every leak of classified information." Addressing the reporter who 
had asked the question, Bush echoed the phrase that McClellan had 
frequently used in his press briefings and quipped, "By the way, 
if you know anything, Martin, would you please bring it forward 
and help solve the problem?"</p>
<p>
Perhaps Bush needed a good chuckle after reading--or being briefed 
on--the testimony that chief weapons hunter David Kay was 
presenting that day to Congress. In an interim report, Kay had 
noted that his Iraq Survey Group had found evidence of 
"WMD-related program activities," but no stocks of unconventional 
weapons. Kay also had an interesting observation about the prewar 
intelligence on Iraq's WMDs: "Our understanding of the status of 
Iraq's WMD program was always bounded by large uncertainties and 
had to be heavily caveated."</p>
<p>
Wait a minute. That was not what Bush and his compadres had said 
prior to the war. Flash back to Bush's get-out-of-town speech on 
March 17, two days before he launched the war. He maintained, 
"Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no 
doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal" 
weapons of mass destruction. Yet Kay was saying there had been 
"large uncertainties" in the intelligence. How does that square 
with Bush's no-doubt claim? It doesn't.</p>
<p>
Kay's testimony is more proof that Bush misrepresented the 
intelligence. Regular readers of this column will know that Kay's 
remark were preceded by similar statements from the House 
intelligence committee and former deputy CIA director, Richard 
Kerr, who has been reviewing the prewar intelligence. Both the 
committee (led by Representative Porter Goss, a Republican and 
former CIA officer) and Kerr have concluded the intelligence of 
Iraq's WMDs was based on circumstantial and inferential material 
and contained many uncertainties.</p>
<p>
Prior to the invasion, administration officials consistently 
declared there was no question Iraq had these weapons. On December 
5, 2002, for instance, Ari Fleischer, then the White House press 
secretary, said, "the president of the United States and the 
secretary of defense would not assert as plainly and bluntly as 
they have that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction if it was not 
true, and if they did not have a solid basis for saying it." But 
what had been that "solid_basis"? Intelligence "bounded by large 
uncertainties"?</p>
<p>
Look at what Kay said about Iraq's nuclear weapons program:</p>
<p>
  <i>"With regard to Iraq's nuclear program, the testimony we have 
obtained from Iraqi scientists and senior government officials 
should clear up any doubts about whether Saddam still wanted to 
obtain nuclear weapons. They have told [the Iraq Survey Group] 
that Saddam Husayn remained firmly committed to acquiring nuclear 
weapons. These officials assert that Saddam would have resumed 
nuclear weapons development at some future point….</i></p>
<p><i> "Despite evidence of Saddam's continued ambition to acquire 
nuclear weapons, to date we have not uncovered evidence that Iraq 
undertook significant post-1998 steps to actually build nuclear 
weapons or produce fissile material….</i></p>
<p><i> "Saddam, at least as judged by those scientists and other insiders 
who worked in his military-industrial programs, had not given up 
his aspirations and intentions to continue to acquire weapons of 
mass destruction."</i></p>
<p>
Compare this assessment to what Bush and Dick Cheney had said 
before the war. In his 2003 State of the Union speech, Bush 
declared that Hussein was a threat because he had "an advanced 
nuclear weapons development program" in the 1990s. (Bush had 
failed to mention that the International Atomic Energy Agency had 
reported in 1998 that it had demolished this "advanced" program.) 
And Cheney on March 16 said, "we believe [Hussein] has, in fact, 
reconstituted nuclear weapons." His aides later said Cheney had 
meant to say "nuclear weapons programs."</p>
<p>
But, according to Kay, the evidence so far collected indicates 
only that Hussein maintained a desire to acquire nuclear weapons 
and had not developed a program to satisfy that yearning. Kay 
later added that it would have taken Iraq five to seven years to 
reconstitute its nuclear weapons program. So what was the evidence 
for Bush's and Cheney's assertions that the program was already 
revved up? By the way, Kay says his team has found "no conclusive 
proof" Hussein tried to acquire uranium in Niger. In fact, he 
reported that one cooperating Iraqi scientist revealed to the ISG 
that another African nation had made an unsolicited offer to sell 
Iraq uranium but there is no indication Iraq accepted the offer.</p>
<p>
Kay also reported, "Our efforts to collect and exploit 
intelligence on Iraq's chemical weapons program have thus far 
yielded little reliable information on post-1991 CW stocks and CW 
agent production, although we continue to receive and follow leads 
related to such stocks." But before the war, the Bush 
administration had said flat-out that Iraq possessed chemical 
weapons. Did it neglect to pass along to Kay the information upon 
which it based this claim? (Actually, the Defense Intelligence 
Agency in September 2002 concluded there was no "reliable 
information" on whether Iraq had produced or stockpiled chemical 
weapons, but that did not stop Bush and his aides from stating 
otherwise.)</p>
<p>
How did Bush respond to Kay's interim findings? He proclaimed they 
proved that he had been correct all along. The "interim report," 
Bush remarked, "said that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 
program spanned more than two decades. That's what [Kay] 
said....He's saying Saddam Hussein was a threat, a serious 
danger."</p>
<p>
Reality check: Bush had said that the main reason to go to war was 
because Hussein possessed "massive" stockpiles of unconventional 
weapons and at any moment could hand them off to al Qaeda (with 
whom Bush claimed Hussein was "dealing"--even though the evidence 
on that point was and continues to be, at best, sketchy). Now Bush 
is asserting that Hussein was a threat that could only be 
countered with invasion and occupations because he had weapons 
research programs that indeed violated United Nations resolutions 
but that had not produced any weapons. That's a much different 
argument. Bush, Cheney, McClellan, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul 
Wolfowitz, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and others continue to 
deny they overstated (or misrepresented) the case for war. But the 
evidence is incontrovertible, and it keeps on piling up.</p>
<p>
So all they have is spin. Bush changes the terms. McClellan, 
Rumsfeld, RIce insist that before the war <i> everybody</i> knew 
that Iraq had WMDs. Everybody, that is, except the folks putting 
together the intelligence assessments chockfull of uncertainties. 
When it comes to the Wilson affair, the White House ducks and 
covers, claiming it had no reason to react to the original 
anonymous-source leak, even though its officials (at the least) 
considered the leak solid enough to talk up to other reporters. 
And instead of confronting the ugly (and perhaps criminal) 
implications of the leak, the White House's allies in Washington 
lash out at Wilson, in a vicious blame-the-victim offensive, 
while 
Mister Change-the-Tone has nothing to say publicly about this. 
What if Wilson is a Democratic partisan? That does not excuse what 
was done to his wife.
</p>
<p>
Leaking and lying--these are not actions easy to explain away. 
Drip, drip, drip--that's the sound often associated with 
Washington scandals. But now it may also be the sound of the truth 
catching up to the propagandists and perps of the Bush White 
House.
