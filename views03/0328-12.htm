<p>One would have thought Washington had learned from the 1961 Bay of
 Pigs fiasco that you can't really trust exiles who assure you that their people
 will greet you enthusiastically as liberators and rise up against the regime. 
 Despite optimistic predictions, there have thus far been no mass defections of
 Iraqi soldiers, there have been no spontaneous uprisings against Saddam Hussein
 and U.S. and British soldiers attempting to enter Iraqi cities have been met not
 by cheers and flowers but by bullets and grenades.
<p>And this has all taken place in predominantly Shiite-populated
 sections of southern Iraq long considered a center of opposition to Saddam's
 dictatorship.
<p>The reality is that no matter how brutal a dictator may be, people
 tend to defend their homeland against foreign invaders.  Russians defended their
 country through staggering losses against an invading German army despite their
 suffering under Stalin.  The Iraqis fought off the Iranian counter-attack during
 the 1980s even though Saddam Hussein's regime was as repressive then as it is
 now. 
<p>Arabs have been resisting invaders from the West for many centuries,
 going back as far as the Crusades.  They have long shown a preference for local
 tyrants against conquests from abroad.
<p>Indeed, there are disturbing reports of large numbers of Arab men
 from throughout the Middle East and North Africa crossing the Syrian border for
 the purpose of fighting invading U.S. forces.  As with the Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan, the U.S. invasion of Iraq may become a cause celebre in the Islamic
 world.  Volunteers interviewed by the BBC all expressed disdain for Saddam
 Hussein's regime but still saw the war as an act of Western imperialism that had
 to be resisted.
<p>Given that a U.S. military victory will be much more difficult than
 anticipated, so will the post-war U.S. occupation:  It appears that instead of
 presiding over a grateful Iraqi people, U.S. occupation forces will more likely
 have to contend with a resentful and possibly vengeful population.  Any puppet
 government U.S. military authorities might try to set up could not last long on
 their own, thereby requiring a long and difficult occupation.  
<p>The level of opposition to a U.S. invasion - both during and after
 the war and both within and outside of Iraq - will depend in part on the number
 of civilian casualties from the U.S. assault.  Already, civilian deaths are
 mounting and will likely increase dramatically as U.S. forces attempt to seize
 larger urban areas.  Lured into ambushes in crowded residential neighborhoods,
 trapped American soldiers will likely be forced to call in close air support,
 resulting in a tremendous toll in civilian lives.
<p>In anticipation of such a scenario, the Bush Administration is
 already attempting to inoculate itself from criticism by claiming that Saddam
 Hussein is using "human shields," though virtually all the Iraqi civilians
 killed so far have been ordinary people in or near their homes.  Similarly,
 claims that the Iraqis are fighting unfairly by placing most of their fighting
 units in the cities raises the question as to how the Iraqi army would survive
 if they did otherwise:  Operation Desert Storm showed what would happen if they
 simply left their troops vulnerable out in flat open desert.  There are no
 forests or mountains in most of Iraq in which to hide.  As a result, as has been
 done throughout thousands of years of warfare in the Middle East, the cities are
 defended from within.
<p>The Pentagon claims that such civilian casualties are "unavoidable."
  This, however, is patently false.  Civilian casualties are unavoidable only if
 the war is unavoidable.  This war was not unavoidable.  As a result, such
 efforts to relieve the United States from moral responsibility will likely fall
 on deaf ears. 
<p>Unlike twelve years ago, the Islamic world now has access to satellite
 television, which will be broadcasting scenes of American forces killing large
 numbers of Muslim civilians and laying waste to their cities.  This can only
 result in the growth of anti-American extremism throughout the Middle East and
 beyond.
<p>And this war was supposed to make us safer from terrorism?
