<p><i>The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive.</i> 

<br>&#151; Shakespeare, King Lear</p> 


<P>He owes a debt of gratitude to those who have gone before him. Without them he would be nothing more than a muscle-bound footnote in the annals of American political history. As it is, and thanks to his concupiscent predecessors, no one so much as blinks an eye but casts a vote instead, making Arnold Schwartzenegger the governor of California. 

<P>Fidelity has not been the hallmark of politicians in days gone by, but historical miscreants were favored by a press and populace that didn't think their private conduct was the public's business. There were of course exceptions. 

<P>Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 1970s, was accompanied by Annabelle Battistella in his limousine one night in 1974. When the limousine was stopped for driving without lights by the U.S. Park Police, Annabelle, (better known as "Fanne Fox, the Argentine Firecracker") jumped out of the car and into the Tidal Basin. Although the episode generated a fair amount of publicity for the chairman, the attendant notoriety was the exception rather than the rule. Times would soon change. 

<P>Former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart from Colorado owed his fall from grace and presidential potential to his challenge to the press to catch him in inappropriate conduct. When a picture was published showing not his wife, but a woman named Donna Rice, sitting on his lap, the wind of outrage from a moral electorate was so strong as to force him to withdraw from the race. 

<P>The right wing's delight at recounting tales of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual peccadillos became the stuff of impeachment proceedings when Monica Lewinsky entered the oval office. The outrage was palpable and Mr. Clinton gave the mob what it wanted when he lied about the relationship. 

<P>Clinton lacked Mr. Schwarzenegger's straightforward approach to tales of group sex, groping, and crude comments. The governor-elect was forthright about what had gone on in his past and even somewhat apologetic. Commenting on the Los Angeles Times article that described women's accounts of him grabbing their breasts or putting his hand under their clothes he was quite apologetic. He said: "Why has this not come out before? Why have they not called me? Why has no one said, 'Arnold, you went too far.' If someone said this to me I would apologize immediately." 

<P>What we learn from Mr. Schwarzenegger's explanation is that the proper response a woman should make when being assaulted by a well-mannered boor, as Mr. Schwarzenegger obviously is, is a gentle reproach. The woman in the elevator whose bikini he tried to remove should have said something like: "Sir, I can take off my own bikini. Thank you for offering to help." Similar responses when he fondled them would also have been appropriate. They could not have known. Mr. Schwarzenegger said much of the Los Angeles Times story was nothing more than trash politics adding, however: "But at the same time, I have to tell you that I always say, that wherever there is smoke, there is fire. That is true." 

<P>Applying to Mr. Clinton the standards that were applied to Mr. Schwarzenegger, it becomes obvious that what Bill Clinton should have done was to go on national television and provide a graphic description of all that took place in the Oval Office when he was in the company of Monica Lewinsky. If Mr. Clinton had done that, his erstwhile detractors would have applauded him for his candor in much the same way that Mr. Schwarzenegger has received kudos for having the courage to stand up and admit his foibles even though he didn't know they were foibles until that was explained to him. No one would have dared suggest that Mr. Clinton be impeached after he had admitted and described, the error of his ways. 

<P>Unlike Hillary Clinton, who finally had enough of her husband's peregrinations, Maria Shriver leaped to her husband Mr. Schwartzenegger's defense. In one of her appearances she said: "I believe he's handled himself in this situation in the best possible manner. He apologized and that's courageous." She also said that she had met thousands of women who had worked with her husband who said he was an "extraordinary gentleman," thus demonstrating that although he had groped more than a dozen women, there were thousands he had left alone. That was proof, if proof were needed, of remarkable restraint. Indeed, some felt left out. One of those he did not grope shouted out at him as he went by at a rally: "Grope me," showing herself to be a good sport if ever there was one. 

<P>Julie Vandermost, president of the California Women's Leadership Association, a Republican group and strong supporter of the governor-elect, said she was glad Mr. Schwarzenegger told the truth about his gropings. She added: "I don't expect Schwarzenegger to be groping people in Sacramento," an expectation I am sure will not be disappointed. With those words of comfort, designed to reassure women in Sacramento who might otherwise be afraid of their new governor, Ms. Vandermost, ably assisted by millions of California voters, put to bed, as it were, any concerns the good women of Sacramento may have had about protecting their virtue form a sexual predator. With them, all California women can breath a big, collective sigh of relief.
