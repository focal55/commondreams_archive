Greetings from the Green Party, the party of peace!
  <p>Tonight the President promised America a policy of war. 
      War on Iraq. War on minorities. War on the poor. War on regular working 
      people.&nbsp; In response, the Green Party, America's only growing 
political party, offers an alternative of peace.</P>
      <p>I represent almost 30,000 working people in Minneapolis, 
      Minnesota. I know my constituents personally, and I know their struggles 
      for decent housing and decent work. When my constituents need help, they 
      call me on the phone. That&#8217;s grassroots democracy in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota.</P>
      <p>Tonight, in Washington D.C., I must ask:&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;Who 
      phoned Bush and asked for this war?&#8221;&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;Who phoned Congress and 
asked for this war?&#8221;</P>
      <p>I know that America did not dial that number.</P>
      <p>Someone else did.</P>
      <p>I&#8217;ve got a message for the CEOs of the oil corporations 
      and of the weapons manufacturers. You&#8217;re tying up the line. America is 
trying to get through.</P>
      <p>Like 169 other Green city council members, mayors, county 
      supervisors, school board members, and state representatives, my phone is 
ringing off the hook. Our constituents are calling us.&nbsp;</P>
      <p>They are saying, &#8220;We are worried about this war.&#8221; They 
      are saying, &#8220;We want respect and equality.&#8221; They are saying, &#8220;We want good 
      jobs, education, and health care.&#8221; The Green response is always the same: 
&#8220;You are not alone. We will help you.&#8221;</P>
      <p>That&#8217;s our message tonight.</P>
      <p>* * *&nbsp;</P>
      <p>The President promised a policy of war 
        on Iraq. In response, the Green Party offers the only national security 
  policy that really works: A policy whose goal is peace, not war.</P>
      <p>America can make peace, not war, by putting a stop to the 
      global trade in weapons. We must stop it at its source. That&#8217;s here, at 
      home, in the United States. U.S.-based corporations are the prime 
      suppliers of weapons to the world, and European corporations are not far 
      behind. It&#8217;s common sense. It&#8217;s time to put the weapons manufacturers out 
of business.</P>
      <p>America can make peace, not war, only if we are 
      consistent in our support for democracy. The foreign policy of supporting 
      &#8220;our&#8221; dictators against &#8220;their&#8221; dictators has been a failure. Saddam 
      Hussein is in power today because the U.S. government once supported him, 
      just as it once supported bin Laden. It is time instead to consistently 
      support democracy. Perhaps it is unfair to expect George W. Bush to 
      understand democracy, much less consistently promote it, but that&#8217;s the 
agenda that will win America trust and allies in an uncertain world.</P>
      <p>America can make peace, not war, by helping the economies 
      of the poorer countries of the world. Exploitation breed poverty, poverty 
      breeds hatred, and hatred breeds terror. Unrestricted corporate power has 
      caused massive unemployment across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and 
      today threatens the United States as well. In its place, we need a global 
      economic policy whose primary goal is the elimination of poverty, the 
      creation of sustainable industries, and support for real democracy based 
on the empowerment of working people.</P>
      <p>America can make peace, not war, by breaking the hold of 
      the oil corporations on Congress. It&#8217;s time to kick the oil addiction. 
      Right now. America has the technological know-how and the renewable 
      resources to make the break. We can and should build up our solar, wind, 
      and other renewable energy sources now.</P>
      <p>Americans want security, not unending war. In its 
      eagerness to invade Iraq, the political establishment has revealed its 
      true purpose. Not security for Americans, but oil for corporations. Not 
      peace in the Middle East, but military bases across the globe. Bush is no 
      reluctant warrior, he is a warmongering draft-dodger, and together with a 
      weak and compliant Democratic Party in Congress, he is threatening 
      American interests.</P>
      <p>The President claims the inspections have failed. He is 
      wrong. In fact, his attempts to drum up a war fever are what has failed. 
      The lives of millions of innocent Iraqi civilians are not worth one drop 
      of Bush&#8217;s oil, and American soldiers should not be sacrificed for it. Let 
      us build our security on a foundation of international peace, justice, and 
      democracy.</P>
      <p>* * * *</P>
      <p>Americans want a policy for domestic peace as well.</P>
      <p>The Bush administration&#8217;s attacks on minorities don&#8217;t sit 
      well with many Americans. The Democratic silence in the face of these 
      attacks is shameful. The slogan &#8220;United We Stand&#8221; is mirrored by &#8220;Divided 
      We Fall&#8221; and the constant chipping away at the legacy of the civil rights 
      movement leaves us wondering why he is promoting division. Why the attacks 
      on human rights, on immigrants, and on affirmative action?</P>
      <p>Tonight, in Washington D.C., I must ask: &#8220;Who phoned Bush 
      and asked for these attacks?&#8221;</P>
      <p>I know that America did not dial that number.</P>
      <p>I am a proud to be a member of the political party that 
      guarantees the rights of ALL Americans. That&#8217;s the guarantee of the Green 
      Party. We defend the rights of immigrants, and we call for amnesty for all 
      undocumented workers. We support the civil rights of lesbian, gay, 
      bisexual, and transgendered people in housing, jobs, civil marriage and 
      benefits, child custody and in all areas of life, the right to be treated 
      equally with all other people. We believe in making right the wrongs of 
      history, and we support affirmative action and reparations for 
slavery.</P>
      <p>We Greens say to the President and to Congress: 
      &#8220;Immigrants are not the enemy!&#8221; &#8220;Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered 
      people are not the enemy!&#8221; &#8220;People of color are not the enemy!&#8221; It&#8217;s time 
      to stop your war on minorities. It&#8217;s time to secure domestic peace through 
      equal rights for all. That is the Green guarantee.</P>
      <p>* * *</P>
      <p>Americans want not only peace, we also want 
      prosperity.</P>
      <p>Struggling to pay for housing, struggling to pay for 
      school, struggling to find a secure job, worrying about whether we&#8217;ll keep 
      it, working people in this country have gotten a raw deal. Now the 
      administration would compound our pain by cutting taxes on the rich, at a 
      time when public services are being eliminated.</P>
      <p>Tonight, in Washington D.C., I must ask: &#8220;Who phoned Bush 
      and asked for these cuts?&#8221;</P>
      <p>I know that America did not dial that number.</P>
      <p>Bush calls it an economic stimulus package. Greens ask 
      &#8220;economic stimulus for whom?&#8221; It is time for an economic stimulus package 
      for the rest of us.</P>
      <p>Where the Washington establishment wages a war on public 
      education, social welfare, public lands, and local government, the Green 
      Party takes a very different view.</P>
      <p>We call for full federal funding to support children, 
      families, the unemployed, elderly and disabled. We call for a graduated 
      supplemental income to maintain all adult incomes above the poverty level. 
      We support a guaranteed living wage for all Americans. We support health 
      care for all through universal national health insurance. We support the 
      preservation of public wildlands for future generations. We support the 
      labor movement and call for the repeal of the undemocratic Taft-Hartley 
      law so that workers can freely organize unions.</P>
      <p>The Green Party stands with working people because we ARE 
      working people, and we&#8217;re committed to an economic policy that puts human 
      needs before corporate greed.&nbsp;</P>
      <p>* * *</P>
      <p>Yet tonight, as the economy is failing most Americans, 
      the President promises war.</P>
      <p>Mr. Bush, America did not ask you for this war. America 
      did not ask you for these attacks on minorities. America did not ask you 
      for tax cuts for the rich.</P>
      <p>Mr. Bush, it is time to hang up the phone. America&#8217;s 
      trying to get through!</P>
      <p>* * *</P>
      <p>And to the members of Congress, both Democrat and 
      Republican, the 250,000 members of the Green Party have this to say:</P>
      <p>You have wasted too many opportunities to deal directly 
      with America&#8217;s problems. Tonight, on the eve of war, America cannot wait 
      any longer.&nbsp;</P>
      <p>Our nation cannot afford to see pressing issues, like 
      health care for all, kicked back and forth like a political football from 
      election to election. Working people need health care now.</P>
      <p>Our people and planet cannot afford this war for oil. 
      Dependency on oil is unhealthy for Americans and it is contributing to the 
      global warming threat. The time for political procrastination is long 
      gone; it&#8217;s time for corrective action now.</P>
      <p>I know that many Americans feel the same way. I hear it 
      from my constituents all the time.&nbsp;</P>
      <p>To those Americans who are looking for a way out, the 
      Green Party says, &#8220;We are here, we are growing, we are your way out!&#8221; We 
      are the alternative.</P>
      <p>Together with Greens in 90 nations worldwide, we 
      represent a new kind of politics resting on four pillar values: Grassroots 
      Democracy - Ecology - Social Justice - Non-Violence.</P>
      <p>No corporate contributors are tying up our phone lines. 
We are waiting to hear from you.</P>
