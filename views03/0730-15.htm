<p>No less an authority than John Dean has recently 
commented on the resemblances between the Watergate scandal and 
the Bush Administration's deceptions regarding Iraq.  One of the 
stranger resemblances contains a lesson the administration 
apparently has not learned.  
<p>According to the conventional wisdom about Watergate,  
Nixon's fate was sealed by his decision to, in his own 
words, "stonewall," to bluff and invoke executive privilege and deny 
any knowledge of wrongdoing in the White House.  For example, Barry 
Goldwater said in an interview with CBS that, had Nixon admitted to 
the American people at an early stage that he had made a mistake, 
his presidency would have survived.  Nixon's aversion to such an 
apology has been cited as evidence of, depending on the 
commentator's politics, either loyalty to his subordinates or the 
delusion that he held enough power to avoid culpability for his acts.  
<p>Now, as the mainstream press begins to note that the 
administration's dishonesty extends a great deal further than the 16 
little words that Condoleezza Rice sniffed about on CNN, Bush finds 
himself in a scandal that may eventually dwarf Watergate.  He also, it 
seems, finds himself incapable of acknowledging his own public 
statements.  On July 17, when asked whether he accepted 
responsibility for the words he'd used in the State of the Union 
address, Bush replied petulantly: "I take the responsibility for making 
the decision ... to put together a coalition to remove Saddam 
Hussein."  Several days later, new White House Press Secretary Scott 
McClellan turned rhetorical back flips, clumsily, to keep from answering

the same question. 
<p>In the wake of this dissembling, Bush's backers have been 
forced into multiple, contradictory stories about the State of the Union, 
and GOP operatives are starting to get nervous.  For example, 
Republican National Committee member John Paul Hammerschmidt of 
Arkansas was quoted by the Associated Press this week as 
saying, "For the first time he's waffled a bit on the Niger-uranium 
story.  They didn't confront that totally .... I'm not sure they've totally 
gotten their act together."  
<p>A number of journalists, both on-line and off, have 
speculated about why Bush can't make a simple and relatively 
painless apology.  Some believe that Bush, having been rescued from 
the Vietnam draft and multiple business failures by his father's 
connections, simply doesn't know how to take responsibility for his own 
actions.  Others note that his father's experience in the Iraq-Contra 
scandal may have convinced him that he, also, partakes of Reagan's 
famous Teflon.  Most disturbingly, both Joe Klein of Time and Richard 
Cohen of the Washington Post have advanced the theory that Bush is 
so addicted to wishful thinking that he can't tell whether he is lying or 
not.  
<p>All of these explanations may carry some truth.   Even 
Klein's and Cohen's idea that Bush is almost completely disconnected 
from reality has been borne out by his outrageous and under-reported 
statement on July 14 that the administration had given Saddam "a 
chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn't let them in."  
<p>But Bush is also, as we all are, influenced by his rhetorical 
environment.   In part, he is unable to accept responsibility for the 
Niger "mistake" because he is the victim of his own disdain of 
subtlety.  In the world he has evoked for the American people, 
terrorists "hate us because we are good" and there is no possible gray 
area between "for us" and "against us."  And a "good" leader cannot 
be mistaken in anything.  	
<p>But even more than this, Bush is the unwitting victim of his 
allies on the right, the ultraconservative "Amen Corner" of radio hosts,

columnists and miscellaneous dittoheads typified by David Horowitz 
and Ann Coulter.  Commenting on the Niger controversy in an article 
called "The Party of Sabotage," Horowitz rolls out the (now nearly 
inevitable on the right-wing) comparison between anti-Iraq-war 
protestors and Neville Chamberlain, and ventriloquizes the 
Democratic Party as saying "We want congressional investigations [of 
Bush's claims about Iraq] to tie up the Administration, distract it from

its war tasks and encourage our enemies."   Similarly, Coulter took 
some time this week from schilling her book-length paean to Joseph 
McCarthy, Treason, to extrude a column equating Howard Dean's 
questions about Iraq with "the Odai and Qusai Hussein Memorial 
Fund," reminding the reader that Democrats incensed by Bush's Iraq 
claims "never before viewed lying as a negative," and concluding 
that "Clinton [who is, of course, another inevitability] also lied every

time he said 'God bless America,' though he doesn't believe in God or 
America."  
<p>To be sure, there is an increasing awareness on the far 
right that the ultra-right, especially the extremely visible Coulter, is an 
embarrassment.  And Bush has never gone nearly as far in voicing anti- American sentiments as his journalistic partisans and his subordinates 
have.  For instance, Attorney General Ashcroft's public statement that 
critics of the Administration would "only aid terrorists .... [t]hey give 
ammunition to America's enemies" is much harsher than anything 
Bush has said; being a uniter rather than a divider, Bush prefers to 
ridicule dissent rather than demonize it, as when he compared the 
millions of Americans who protested the impending war on February 15 
to a "focus group."
<p>But it is hard to avoid parallels between Bush's preference 
for a black-and-white, heroes-and-demons view of reality and the 
words of Coulter, Ashcroft, and Horowitz.  So it is also hard to avoid 
the conclusion that Bush can't back away from his previous "mistakes" 
because he tacitly approves of a political climate in which even the 
mildest criticism of the administration constitutes, well, Treason. Even 
more than his own arrogance and credulity, the would-be Emperor's 
courtiers are encouraging him to parade around naked, and people 
have started to notice.

Writing', is forthcoming from Hampton Press.  His collaborative weblog,

Guardian of London as one of the best antiwar sites on the web.
