<p>Outspoken Pentagon 
        advisor Richard Perle recently called for Iraq's debt to be cancelled 
        as a way of teaching banks about the &quot;moral hazard of ... 
        lend[ing] to a vicious dictatorship.&quot;
<p>Fair enough. Other 
        countries with &quot;odious debt&quot; incurred under nasty regimes 
        may be granted debt forgiveness. Why not Iraq?
<p>Why not indeed. A 
        war profiteer like Perle lecturing on morality is doubtful enough, 
        but who in today's occupied Iraq will really profit from debt 
        forgiveness, the Iraqi people or companies like Halliburton?
<p>At stake is more 
        than $184 billion of pending contracts and debts against Iraq, many 
        of which transpired before the 1991 invasion of Kuwait. In other 
        words, even deals inked when Saddam Hussein was considered a US ally 
        could now be considered odious debt.
<p>No small 
        coincidence that the countries slated to lose most from an Iraqi 
        write-off include Russia, France and Germany: Bush's axis-of-just-as-evil
         for opposing the recent invasion of Iraq.
<p>But taking Perle's 
        moral high ground for argument's sake, consider that Chile's 
        Pinochet, Indonesia's Suharto, South Korea's Park Chung Hee, and yes, 
        Iraq's Hussein were all former recipients of White House largesse. So 
        much for the US government steering clear of vicious dictators.
<p>And of course, 
        today's &quot;war on terror&quot; has become a gold mine for brutal 
        regimes of strategic US interest.
<p>Take Uzbekistan. Despite an abysmal human rights
  record and corrupt government, the country received
  $500 million in US funding last year - $79 million
  specifically earmarked for police and intelligence
services which use <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,963497,00.html" target="_new">&quot;torture as a routine investigative technique.&quot;</A> Its proximity to Afghanistan and expanding US military presence guarantee ever more funding to back the savage Uzbek government, step up repression and no doubt create the kind of Islamic fundamentalism the US should be fighting in the first place.
<p>And then there's 
        Pakistan. General Pervez Musharraf seized power in a 1999 coup, 
        stifling opposition and rewriting the constitution to shore up his 
        dubious power base - not exactly a model of democratic leadership. 
        Regardless, Pentagon ally Musharraf just left Camp David with $3 
        billion in fresh US grants, for things like upping the nuclear war 
        ante with India.
<p>How ironic that 
        dictatorships like Uzbekistan and Pakistan can cash in on the 
        &quot;war on terror,&quot; while fledgling democracies defying 
        Washington's unilateral excesses are punished. The Bush 
        administration's recent rampage against the International Criminal 
        Court (ICC) is a case in point: 64 countries receiving US military 
        aid were <A href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/abs_news_body.asp?section=World%20&amp;oid=27240" target="_new">forced
         to sign bilateral agreements</A> exempting US troops from 
        prosecution, or else risk losing the aid. The Bahamas, for instance, 
        was warned funds would be withheld for paving and lighting an airport 
        runway, and Caribbean states were told they could lose hurricane 
        relief and rural dentistry benefits if they didn't support 
        Washington's attack on the ICC. 
<p>In other words, 
        the US government provides funding for &quot;torture as a routine 
        investigative technique&quot; but not necessarily for hurricane 
        relief. No wonder they hate us.
<p>The White House is 
        quick to point out that some countries have demonstrated loyalty to 
        the Bush administration by sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq: 
        Poland, Ukraine, Nicaragua, and El Salvador among others. Rarely 
        mentioned, however, is the fact that US taxpayers will be funding 
        this &quot;coalition of the billing&quot; to the tune of $250 million 
        this year alone.
<p>But who really 
        benefits from massive cash infusions to Iraq, estimated to be costing 
        US taxpayers $3.9 billion every month? And who would benefit from a 
        hasty write-off of Iraq's past debt?
<p>There's no doubt 
        the country's in chaos and needs help. Twelve years of debilitating 
        sanctions have left the population and infrastructure ravaged, while 
        the recent invasion and aftermath have left thousands dead and 
        millions unemployed. Meanwhile, attacks against US service members 
        grow more frequent and bloody every week.
<p>But not 
        everybody's hurting. Halliburton, the Texan oil company tied to US 
        vice president Dick Cheney, is making a killing on subsidiary 
        contracts to Iraq, doing everything from repairing oil wells to 
        providing housing for US troops. Corporate cronies will also benefit 
        from Bush administration plans to privatize Iraq's 100 state-owned 
        firms, probably at fire sale prices.
<p>No doubt the lack 
        of financial transparency in today's Iraq creates unprecedented 
        opportunities. Some US firms have already been charged with bilking 
        millions of dollars in bogus rebuilding contracts, while the 
        integrity of the US-UK controlled fund slated to recover foreign 
        Iraqi assets has been called into question.
<p>Clearly, throwing 
        more cash into this mess makes no sense. How long can US taxpayers 
        shoulder the unilateral burden? What new dictators will be propped 
        up? What assets and national resources will be privatized away from 
        the Iraqi people without their consent? How long before they negate 
        today's agreements as odious?
<p>Bottom line, until 
        a stable government is in place, truly representative of the Iraqi 
        people, there should be no debt cancellations - reschedulings or 
        delayed payment allowances perhaps, but no write-offs. Same goes for 
        privatizations. The Bush administration's secretive, unilateral and 
        unaccountable approach to finances is among our biggest moral hazards 
        in Iraq.</p>
