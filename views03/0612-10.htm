<p>Lisa Stewart is 33 years old and has terminal breast
cancer.  Inevitably, she has to grapple with a whole
range of healthcare and end-of-life issues.
Confronting death is an excruciatingly painful process
for most terminally sick people, and particularly for
those who are young.  Lisa's case has a special
poignancy to it because she is a parent.  When she
dies, she will leave a five-year-old daughter along
with her partner of 10 years.  Yet while most families
endure hardship and insecurity when an adult member is diagnosed with a terminal illness, only a small subsection experience the difficulties that Lisa's family has already had to confront.  Lisa is a lesbian. Like their gay male counterparts, lesbian-headed households constitute a family-type that is largely unrecognized by current law and policy. Consequently, same-sex couple families are uniquely disadvantaged during times of extreme sickness and imminent death.

<p>Take, for instance, the issue of health insurance.
The fact that the North American system of health
insurance is in crisis is a well-known fact -- over 40
million Americans currently lack health insurance.
What is less well known is that gay men and lesbians are over-represented among the uninsured.  People in committed same-sex relationships are often ineligible for the health benefits employers regularly extend to their employees legally married spouses, because access to these benefits is contingent on civil marriage -- a right denied to gay and lesbian couples regardless of how long they have been together.  Even when companies offer domestic partner benefits to same-sex partners of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, these are usually taxed as income by the federal government, whereas spousal benefits are not -- an inequity that causes economic hardship to many gay and lesbian-headed families.

<p>The non-recognition of gay and lesbian relationships,
and the disadvantage this fosters, is especially
problematic given the economic insecurity prevalent in
the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.
Contrary to the dominant myth, gay men and lesbians
are actually less affluent than the general
population.  Based on Census and General Social Survey
Data, economist Lee Badgett shows that gay men earn on
average 17-28% less than their heterosexual
counterparts.  Although lesbians earn the same as
heterosexual women, lesbian couples earn less than
heterosexual couples because women on average earn
less than men.  Facing major fiscal constraints, few
can afford domestic partner benefits that increase
their taxable income, while large numbers remain
without the means to buy health insurance
independently.

<p>Lisa Stewart joined the ranks of the uninsured when
her illness forced her into unemployment.  Her partner
Lynn, who works in the South Carolina public school
system, was unable to add Lisa to her health insurance
policy.  The South Carolina public school system does
not recognize lesbian and gay couples as family, or
offer domestic partner benefits.  Seeking health
insurance to cover her enormous chemotherapy bills,
Lisa applied to the State Cancer Aid program.  Yet
while the South Carolina public school system refused
her health coverage because she was not married to her
partner, the State Cancer Aid program counted Lynn's
salary and assets as household income -- and denied
Lisa coverage on the basis of excessive resources.
Lisa's only recourse was to separate households from
her partner's in order to qualify for state aid.

<p>Since current law and policy fail to recognize
same-sex partners as family members, Lynn is also
unable to take leave from work to care for Lisa under
the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  Much
heralded by liberals, FMLA was passed in 1993 and
applies to people working in companies with over 50
employees, and who have clocked 1,250 hours of work in
the previous 12-month period.  It provides up to 12
weeks of unpaid aid to care for immediate family
members who are sick, as well as after the birth or
adoption of a child.  The legislation applies,
however, to the "husband or wife as defined or
recognized under State law for purposes of marriage in
the State where the employee resides, including common
law marriage in states where it is recognized."  As it
stands, then, FMLA prevents same-sex partners from
taking time off to care for each other.

<p>Lynn won't get Social Security survivors benefits when
Lisa dies, either.  Despite the fact that gay men and
lesbians help fund the system, Social Security
precludes same-sex partners from receiving these
survivor or spousal benefits.  Even divorced
heterosexuals can sometimes count on a portion of
their former spouse's Social Security income upon
his/her death.  By contrast, same-sex partners who
have supported each other for a lifetime get nothing
from the system. Pensions and 401Ks also discriminate
against gay couples.

<p>The irony of all this is that Lisa Stewart is lucky.
She has an extended biological family that fully
supports her relationship with her partner.  If she
didn't, her death could devastate Lynn and her
daughter -- her family of choice -- economically,
emotionally and as a unit.

<p>Completing a variety of legal forms and documents is
imperative when the law doesn't recognize your family,
and especially when you want to prioritize your family
of choice over biological relatives who may reject
your primary relationship.  But this creates a
danger-zone for gay and lesbian families.  If lesbians
or gay men are incapacitated in the hospital without
having first completed medical power of attorney
forms, then their closest blood relatives, and not
their partners, are authorized to make important
healthcare decisions for them.  Without a completed
"consent to autopsy and disposal of remains" form -- a
form that doesn't exist in all states -- the members of
a lesbian or gay man's biological family, rather than
their partner, gets to determine the place of burial,
as well as whether or not to cremate the dead
individual's remains.  Without a will that spells out inheritance rights, a shared house in the name of one partner in same-sex relationship will automatically be inherited by the dead individual's nearest biological relative, not by the deceased lesbian or gay man's partner.

<p>Of course, when a parent dies, the most vulnerable
people in the whole scenario are the surviving
children.  The children of gay and lesbian parents
lack an enormous range of basic securities, but most significantly they lack the automatic right to live with their surviving non-biological parent if their biological parent dies.  Second-parent adoption -- a process by which the non-legal parent acquires parental rights through adoption, while the legal parent retains parental rights -- can alleviate this insecurity by preserving the integrity of the family. Yet second-parent adoption is not available in many states, including Colorado, Wisconsin, and Ohio. Where second-parent adoption does exist it is sufficiently expensive, generally costing thousands of dollars, that many lower-income lesbians and gay men cannot afford the security it offers.

<p>Second-parent adoption isn't yet recognized in South
Carolina.  The best that Lisa Stewart can do is to
ensure that upon her death Lynn is named the guardian
of their daughter, and hope that this arrangement will
protect their parent-child relationship.

<p>Gay and lesbian-headed families exist in ever
increasing numbers. According to the 2000 Census,
one in three lesbian couples and 22% of gay couples
are raising children.  In other words, there are
67,129 gay male couples, and 100,624 lesbian
couples for whom parenting is a part of daily life.
Many thousands of single GLBT people are also raising
children.  Yet lesbian and gay parents exist in a
strange, economically disadvantaged hinterland
because most family policy gives preference to married, heterosexual couples and their children, excluding all other family types from adequate support. Poor lesbians are particularly vulnerable, as states around the country and the federal government promote heterosexual marriage and "a father for every child" through welfare policy. Gay men and lesbians are effectively required to purchase an approximation of security for their families.  Many cannot afford this luxury.

<p>Under these circumstances, the right's endless
rhetoric about restoring the family to a nuclear unit
comprised of a married man and woman together with
their children is almost beside the point.  Lesbian
and gay headed-families are here to stay.  So, as it
happens, are single parent families, and other
alternative family structures, all of which are just
as worthy of state support as more traditionally
constituted families.

<p>The good news is that public opinion on gay and
lesbian families is changing.  A March 2002 ABC News
Poll found that a plurality of Americans (47 - 42%)
now support adoption by same-sex couples.  A UCLA
survey indicates nearly 60% of college students
support gay marriage.  More and more corporations, municipalities, and newspaper wedding pages recognize same-sex partnerships.

<p>The time is long overdue to change policy to reflect
the current reality of the American family.  No-one
should be forced to take cumbersome and expensive
precautions to protect their family against
discrimination.  The U.S. lags behind dozens of
nations, including Brazil, South Africa and Israel, in recognizing same-sex couples. An inclusive family policy that supports all family types is the best way to prevent the economic marginalization of gay and lesbian-headed families, as well as single-parent families and other families that do not fit the traditional mould.  It is almost certainly the best way to ensure that children like Lisa Stewart's daughter are not left behind at the time when they are most vulnerable -- as they watch their parent weaken and die.
