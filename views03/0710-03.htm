<p>In less than three years, the neo-cons in the Bush administration-Wolfowitz, 
Perle, Cheney and Rumsfeld-have thoroughly degraded America's relationship 
with the world. Any potential successor to President Bush will have a good 
deal of his or her work plan dictated by this indisputable fact. The Bush 
administration has dragged our country and the world down a path of "might 
makes right." The next US President must implement a new foreign policy to 
take us off this dangerous course and remedy the damage done.

<p>In the areas of arms control, multi-lateral security, global warming, 
terrorism, world health-all aspects of foreign policy-a new president would 
need to offer strong leadership and a compelling vision. Yet, with a few

notable exceptions, the Democratic presidential challengers have been loath 
to articulate how they would approach this work. This shows the profound

lack of leadership that the voters perceived in the last election (and we 
know how that turned out) and given the grave state of world affairs, it is 
unconscionable.

<p>The Bush foreign policy has not worked. The goodwill that the world held for 
the U.S. after September 11th has been squandered by Bush's pre-emptive 
attack policy and his takeover of Iraq. The introduction of a Pew Charitable 
Research Center poll released in June states, "The war [in Iraq] has widened 
the rift between Americans and Western Europeans, further inflamed the 
Muslim world, softened support for the war on terrorism, and significantly 
weakened global public support for the pillars of the post-World War II era 
- the U.N. and the North Atlantic alliance." Many Muslim nations fear that 
they might be next on Bush's hit list.

<p>The Bush administration's foreign policy shoots first and asks questions

later. The results are not pretty.

<p>Everyday it seems that another American is killed in occupied Iraq by a 
resentful people whose country's transition to a promised representative

government seems to have been indefinitely put off.  Meanwhile back in 
Afghanistan, (remember Afghanistan?) our troops oversee an increasingly 
lawless country that is ruled once again by warlords and drug smugglers.

<p>In order to gain support for wars and empire building, the President has

wasted our country's resources  providing arms and military training to 
governments that abuse human rights.  According to the Federation of 
American Scientists, these countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, 
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, 
Tajikistan, and Uzebekistan.

<p>Proving that security is secondary to loyalty when it comes to weapons 
makers, the administration has put us on a road toward reviving the arms

race through its plans for new breeds of nuclear weapons and Star Wars 
missile defense. Along the way, a host of international agreements have been 
thrown out the window and international institutions, such as the UN, that 
promote non-violent conflict resolution and international cooperation, have 
been crippled.

<p>The Bush administration has turned our country into the rogue nation. The 
Bush administration extorts other nations into giving them what they want 
while using an increasingly heavy hand to quash dissent here at home.

<p>Our country is still a world leader. Unfortunately, given the 
administration's foreign policy, it's not the kind that we can be proud of.

<p>Recently, Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz contradicted months of 
deception coming out of the White House spin machine about the threat posed 
by weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. In a moment of candor in an 
interview in the July issue of Vanity Fair he stated, "For bureaucratic 
reasons we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was 
the one reason that everyone could agree on."

<p>Bureaucratic agreement, based on a lie, might be nice if you're a right wing 
hawk in Washington who's pushing war. However, if you are a U.S. soldier

stuck in Iraq, an Iraqi child maimed or killed by  "shock and awe" or an

American citizen duped by your government, you may not be so blithe about 
this detail.

<p>If the administration's self-perpetuating war is allowed to dominate the

political landscape, other issues that matter to us such as the sorry state 
of the economy, health care, the environment, education, civil liberties, 
and real security will not be addressed.

<p>We can't allow this to go on.  For the sake of our country, and for the sake 
of a world dangerously destabilized by the administration's unilateral 
attack policy, we need a new foreign policy based on core democratic values 
and the rule of law.

<p>Anyone who runs for president in 2004 must understand this.

<p>We need leaders that will pursue a better vision of our country's role in 
the world; a vision that upholds human rights and democracy by ending arms 
sales to dictators; a vision that will lead us to a new era free from the 
threat of weapons of mass destruction; a vision that cherishes international 
cooperation as both the means and the end.

<p>This is an absolutely crucial time to demonstrate to all presidential 
candidates that millions of Americans demand a better direction for our 
country.  We want positive, constructive leadership toward a foreign policy 
that isn't foreign to our values.

<p>This is no time to be silent. Anyone who runs for President must advocate a 
new foreign policy if they want our support.
