<p>I sat down this morning determined to write about something other than 
the war. After all, there are other things going on... 
<p>The Democrats have come up with a new schedule for the nominating 
season that, if history is any guide at all, is certain to produce exactly 
the opposite of what the conventional wisdom predicts. So, 
front-loading the system to favor the well-financed candidates is just as likely to 
give a boost to Howard Dean, the dark-horse who could pull off the 
better-than-expected showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, as it is to propel 
John Kerry, the early favorite, into locking up the nomination by 
March. Of course, how much the Democratic nomination is worth depends in 
part on the war. 
<p>I paid $30 to fill my car with gas yesterday, and I gave up my SUV 
years ago. And you're telling me this war isn't about oil... 
<p>The woman who Roman Polanski raped 25 years ago has shown up on the 
talk-show circuit, saying the best director nominee should be judged for 
his art, and half the people in Hollywood think the studio that made 
the movie is orchestrating the campaign, and the other half think his 
competitors are, with everyone denying any role. As the mother of a 
13-year-old, which is how old the woman was when she says Polanski forced her 
to have sex, I find the whole thing appalling, but not as appalling as 
a war. 
<p>Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have signed up as television commentators, 
because they want to provide a "thoughtful" debate in 45 scripted 
seconds apiece on "60 Minutes." President Clinton's previous most memorable 
appearance on "60 Minutes" was during the New Hampshire primary, when he 
denied having had an affair with Gennifer Flowers. Don Hewitt, the 
Executive Producer of "60 Minutes," reportedly told the former president 
that he could be the next Edward R. Murrow. Murrow made his name during 
World War II. Will Clinton be the next Scud Stud? Dole was far more eager 
for the job -- 45 seconds with Clinton being far better than 30-second 
impotence ads. This would all be very funny, were anyone in the mood to 
laugh. 
<p>But it's hard to laugh these days, and it's hard to avoid thinking 
about the damn war. At my local synagogue, where I take my children to 
religious school, security has been enhanced. Like generations of Jewish 
children, my kids are always looking for excuses to skip, complaining of 
boredom, wanting to play instead of study. Usually, I jokingly tell 
them that it is part of Jewish tradition to complain, to be forced to 
attend, that someday they will force their own children. 
<p>Yesterday, we didn't joke. Colleen Rowley, one of Time's Women of the 
Year, the author of the now famous -- or infamous -- 9-11 memo about 
the inadequacy of the FBI's counterterrorism efforts, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0306-06.htm">has written another 
memo</a>, this one arguing that the country and the bureau are ill-prepared 
for the likely outbreak of domestic terrorism that a war against Iraq 
will provoke. I do not think I am alone in being far more terrified of 
attacks at home by terrorists provoked by an increasingly unpopular 
American war than I am of Saddam Hussein. 
	<p>Supporters of the war, faced with increasing opposition at home and 
abroad, have taken to raising the decibel of the debate, accusing those 
of us at home who oppose this war of hating President Bush. I don't hate 
the president. I'm from the old school that believes it's not good for 
our politics to brand criticism as slander, disagreements as treason 
and opposition as hatred. I like Karl Rove, the president's top political 
adviser. I respect the presidency, and I have no reason to hate a man 
just because I didn't vote for him. 
	<p>But make no mistake. Bush may not be listening, but that doesn't mean 
the opposition is irrelevant. This is becoming Bush's war, which means 
that if things go poorly, or if terrorism takes lives, or if there is 
no money left at the end for initiatives that people consider more 
important, there will be a political price to be paid. I don't hate him, but 
I am beginning to wonder about his competence and worry about his 
self-righteousness. 
	<p>Imagine Bill Clinton were still president, and doing the same things. 
Imagine that he had lost the support of our allies; the European 
coalition had fallen apart; a nuclear North Korea was a fait accompli; the 
economy was stumbling; 200,000 soldiers were halfway around the world, 
hoping their chemical warfare suits don't have holes; anti-Americanism 
around the world was at a fevered pitch; and we were being told to buy 
duct tape. 
	<p>Would the president's critics be as civil as I have been? They would 
be calling for his impeachment.
