<p>When a federal judge rules on a case in which his financial holdings are at stake, public trust is violated and the public's faith in impartial justice is undermined. Conflicts of interest have no place on the bench. 

<p>Unfortunately, our organizations have discovered a clear-cut case of such a conflict, and we have called upon the federal judiciary to discipline one of its peers, Judge Clarence A. Brimmer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming. 

<p>On July 14, 2003, Judge Brimmer invalidated the so-called "roadless rule," one of the most important public-land conservation initiatives in nearly a century. The rule, put in place during the Clinton administration, empowered the U.S. Forest Service to limit timber harvesting and oil, gas and mineral exploration on 58 million acres of roadless national forests under its management. 

<p>In his sweeping ruling, Judge Brimmer declared that the Forest Service can only prevent new road building in national forests by acting through the Wilderness Act, with the explicit approval of Congress. The oil and gas industry hailed his decision, and no wonder -- they opposed the rule arguing it would prevent them from extracting resouces valued at between $23 billion and $34 billion. 

<p>The Community Rights Counsel (CRC) and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) have reviewed Judge Brimmer's financial disclosure statements. We found that he holds stock or royalty interests in 15 separate oil and gas companies -- some of the same companies that will benefit substantially if the judge's ruling is upheld on appeal. The public documents reveal that as of the end of 2001 (well after he began presiding over the case), Judge Brimmer's stock or royalty interests in oil and gas concerns had a total net worth of between $400,000 and $1.1 million. These interests represent approximately half of the judge's total assets. 

<p>Federal law prohibits a judge from ruling in a case where he has any "interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding." On this basis, CRC and CREW filed an ethics complaint on August 5. This complaint will be reviewed initially by Judge Deanell Tacha, the chief judge of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. It asserts that Judge Brimmer's ruling violates federal conflict-of-interest law and asks for a disciplinary sanction against the judge. Such an action is rare, but it would be hard to find a more clear-cut case than this one, and action must be taken. This is a concrete test of whether or not judges can discipline themselves. 

<p>If you asked any 20 people walking down Mainstreet, U.S.A., if this is the way things should work, "no" would be the firm answer. Even by the too-loose federal judicial ethics standards, Judge Brimmer's behavior is out of bounds. A judge simply cannot rule in a case that could dramatically increase his net worth. We call on Judge Brimmer's peers to act with all due haste.
