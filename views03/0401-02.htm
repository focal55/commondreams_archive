<p>ON APRIL FOOLS' DAY 35 years ago, morning newspapers trumpeted the exceedingly unlikely story that Lyndon B. Johnson had announced his intention not to seek reelection as president of the United States. It was not a gag.
<P>

   In a speech the night before, the beleaguered president had insisted on his determination to bring the war in Vietnam to an end. He said he was ordering a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam above the 20th parallel and was ready for negotiations. Johnson emphasized his wish for peace by renouncing his own political ambition. It seemed that an end to the war was at last possible.
<P>

   ''For four days in April,'' Charles Kaiser wrote in his book ''1968,'' ''joy took the place of anger in America as hope replaced despair.'' War news across the previous months had indeed been staggering: Khe Sanh, the Tet offensive, Westmoreland's plea for more troops beyond the 550,000 he had (''I desperately need reinforcements''), a bitter throng of war opponents storming the Pentagon, the betrayal felt by war supporters embodied in McNamara's resignation. The nation was terribly divided. The war had come to signify all that was wrong. That is why every heart could lift at that morning's front-page news.
<P>

   Whatever his intentions at the start, the president's war policy had shown itself to be a mix of incompetence, deceit, hyperviolence, arrogance toward critics abroad, contempt for dissent at home. But that war policy was also a corrupt and flimsy illusion that had now been discredited. Finally, the United States would not destroy Vietnam to save it. Johnson's withdrawal meant that American decency could triumph after all. I myself was moved to write a letter to President Johnson, whom I had reviled. I thanked him for his magnanimity.
<P>

   Four days later, with the murder of Martin Luther King Jr., the sky fell on America. In that one event, in ways we could not grasp at the time, our nascent hope was dashed, and with it our sense of possible recovery. The assassination went far beyond the death of one man, and its implications transcended the particular struggle with which he was identified.
<P>

   As the riots that broke out after King's murder demonstrated, the racial division in America was even deeper than believed. Only days before, the Kerner Commission had released its bleak finding that the nation had become two nations, divided by race -- and King's death proved it. The Great Society was a false dream, and events of subsequent weeks (the Poor Peoples' Campaign, student riots, Robert Kennedy's murder, convention chaos at Chicago, Nixon elected on a lie about ''secret peace'') laid bare all the ways that America was at war with itself. And, of course, Vietnam resumed its place as the heartbeat of tragedy. Negotiations opened in Paris but would go nowhere for years. The war was not half over. Peace on April 1 -- we should have known better.
<P>

   Those sad events are commonplace memories, essential to what sinks our hearts at the mention of ''the '60s.'' Indeed, they represent a collapse of democratic hope from which, in truth, the United States of America has not recovered. The war against Iraq thus floats on undercurrents of depression that are long familiar, but is a countercurrent of hope still flowing as well?
<P>

   Thirty-five years ago today, Americans woke up to a moral recognition that was as powerful as it would be transitory. It demands to be noted. The president had effectively admitted what the entire nation, across the left-right argument, already intuited -- that the intervention in Vietnam was a mistake, whether defined in moral terms or tactical. There would be no ''winning.'' Further escalation, therefore, would be wrong. That subsequent leaders failed to fulfill the promise of this recognition (Nixon, Kissinger, and the chimera of ''peace with honor'') should not take away from what it signified.
<P>

   When LBJ said, ''Accordingly, I shall not seek  . . .'' he was responding to nothing less than the will of the people as already manifest in polling places, in street demonstrations, on news broadcasts, and in a million living room arguments. Johnson's decision, that is, was a triumph of democracy. The war had to end. The people knew it. And now the president did, too. Politics as moral reckoning. No wonder, for a few days that April, the nation was exhilarated.
<P>

   It is April again. The war machine is loose, apparently unstoppable. An escalating air war, a rush of reinforcements, an enemy that surprises, demonstrators in the streets, a nation divided. But as before, Washington's war policy is made in fantasyland -- and is even now being exposed as such.
<P>

   This anniversary suggests that an on-track war machine can be derailed. A prideful president can be brought down. An April Fools' Day when peace became a joke can be redeemed. Stop the war!
