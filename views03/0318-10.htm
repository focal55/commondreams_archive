<p>The Christian unifier has put a cleaver down the middle of the world as 
he asks for a moment of truth. Ironic that a man who was elevated to the
most powerful position in the world through deception would ask for such
a moment. The path to this moment of truth has been paved with 
fabrications, distortions, arrogance and lies. Ironic too that as Cheney
and Bush exploit 9/11 in the service of this action  no one asks how the
investigation into 9/11 is going. If it remains a vaporous reality it 
can be used any way that is useful. But like the energy policy, 9/11 
will not benefit from an investigation that might reveal more than a 
moment of truth. There were no weapons of mass destruction or Iraqis on 
that day - there was an emotion - the same emotion that is being 
enflamed every day Bush is in power.
<p>Bush comes from a tradition where it is not only fine to say anything to
achieve your end but also recommended. Willy Horton in 1988, McCain's 
wife's breast cancer in the South Carolina primary, Noriega, drugs and 
Panama, Clinton protesting the Vietnam war in Moscow, Gore claims he 
invented the internet, my brother said I won Florida - say anything, 
hope it sticks and take whatever benefit you can from the believed lie.
<p>Bush makes sweeping statements about the inherent and irredeemable evil 
of Saddam Hussein, who ultimately is a symptom and a harvest of the kind
of policies that Bush is now implementing.

<p>On Sunday morning Cheney made it clear that Iraq's oil will belong to 
the Iraqi people - the money their oil generates will be used to rebuild
Iraq. Again, no one asked Mr. Halliburton who will be paid that Iraqi 
money to rebuild what the American taxpayers paid to destroy. No one 
asked who will make the decisions as to who gets what contract in the 
noble rebuilding process. Will the Iraqi people make that decision? Will

<p>France or Germany get a contract?  The Iraqi oil will produce the money 
that this government will use to pay the people this government chooses 
to hire. 

<p>The stand up routine in the Azores proved that Bush is not afraid to 
speak Texan in the middle of the Atlantic. It proved again that Bush is 
neither passionate nor committed - he's not even driven. He is petulant.

<p>Petulance grows out of the inability to reconcile contradictory 
realities. Most of the world is naturally riddled with contradictions. 
Statesmen and leaders have an intuition as to how to navigate those 
crashing waves.  A petulant, impatient leader snaps and belittles - he 
refuses to talk - he blames everything and everyone but himself for the 
mess he feels only he can resolve. If only France would cooperate - if 
only Clinton had taken care of this - if only Saddam would leave the 
country - if only congress would do what I tell it to do. There have 
been crises and conditions which have resolved through peaceful means. 
It has and does happen if visionary men and women lead the way.

<p>We wait now to hear what he has to say - we waited to hear what he had 
to say in the Azores - we'll wait to see what he'll do and what orders 
he'll give. It's humiliating for the country to rest its fortunes and 
conscience on this particularly disagreeable and unevolved human being. 
He represents many things about this country none of which we should 
invest in or try to import. And yet he is now America to the world and 
we citizens are prisoners of that perception.
<p>In his speech,  which he has just delivered to the world with the look 
of pinched consternation, he spoke directly to the Iraqi people. With 
250,000 troops poised and 3.000 "precision guided" missiles aimed at 
Baghdad Bush told the Iraqi people that he has no desire to harm them. I
wonder if that sounded like a moment of truth to them.
<p>Pundits say that Bush will be coronated "If the war goes well..." How 
does a war go well? People die quickly and survivors in terror 
surrender? Not as many people as expected are killed?  Bush has made the
world impossible for moderates. Peacemakers are wimps and appeasers; 
inspectors are enablers; hard hitting journalists are terrorists; 
protesters don't support the troops; Fox is fair and balanced and 
artists should keep their mouths shut. And the extremism that hit us on 
September 11th is being fueled the way the desert sand in southern Iraq 
is being soaked with oil. Bush is the generation that Kennedy said a 
torch had been passed to. But a  torch meant to light the way is being 
used to light a fuse.
