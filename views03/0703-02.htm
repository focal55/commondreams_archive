<p>No story has appeared in The New York Times under Judith Miller's byline

since June 7, but she still works at the paper, according to Catherine Mathis, 
vice president for corporate communications. But, based on other comments by 
Mathis, it is obvious that the wagons are still circling the embattled star 
reporter.

<p>From postwar Iraq, Miller, the Times' expert on chemical and biological 
weapons, wrote a series of exaggerated stories that led readers to believe that 
unconventional weapons programs were being uncovered or weapons of mass 
destruction were about to be found -- and that this supported the Bush administration's 
claims about Saddam Hussein's development of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).

<p>Traveling as an "embed" with one of the teams making up the 75th Exploitation 
Task Force, Miller crossed the line from that of reporter to that of member 
of a team she referred to as "my unit." A professional scandal evolved, with 
Miller's authority, and the credibility of the Times, severely undermined. Many 
critics have pointed out the far superior (and more credible) work on this 
subject by The Washington Post's Barton Gellman.

<p>In the latest major development, Howard Kurtz on June 25 reported in The Washington Post: "Judith Miller played a highly unusual role in an Army unit 
assigned to search for dangerous Iraqi weapons," according to U.S. military 
officials, "prompting criticism that the unit was turned into a 'rogue operation.'"

<p>Officers told Kurtz that Miller acted as a middleman between the Army unit 
with which she was embedded and opposition leader Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi 
National Congress. She already had been quoted by Kurtz (on May 26) as having 
privately asserted that Chalabi "provided most of the front page exclusives on 
WMD" to the Times; and that her mobile exploration team was "using Chalabi's 
[intelligence] network for its own WMD work."

<p>The Times responded to Kurtz through Miller's leading public defender, 
Assistant Managing Editor Andrew Rosenthal, who dismissed the notion that she 
exercised influence over the unit as "an idiotic proposition. ... Judith Miller is a 
reporter. She's not a member of the U.S. armed forces."

<p>Responding to my written questions, Mathis, the Times spokeswoman, insisted 
that Miller "did not depend, heavily or otherwise, on Mr. Chalabi as a source 
while in Iraq." But there is unchallenged evidence from Miller's own hand that 
she heavily depended on Chalabi as a source in the field. Moreover, Chalabi 
himself on "The Charlie Rose Show" on June 10 bragged that he was her prime 
source for WMD information.

<p>If the Times had it to do over again, would it sanction the policy of 
permitting senior reporters to be so thoroughly "embedded" with units in Iraq? Mathis 
told me: "The embedding arrangements carried conditions that were consistent 
for all news organizations. As far as we know, there was no difference between 
arrangements [for the Post's Gellman] and Ms. Miller's arrangements with

regard to security review or other substantive aspects of the accreditation, but 
the Post did not disclose Mr. Gellman's arrangements to its readers, so we 
cannot be certain of this."

<p>However, Gellman himself has disclosed the negotiated arrangements that 
specifically kept him free of the "embed" review snare. He usually quoted military 
sources in the field by name, while she relied overwhelmingly on anonymous 
sources; and he frequently scooped her.

<p>One of the most curious turns in this affair occurred after Miller returned 
home from Iraq. With science reporter William Broad, she wrote a front-page 
story on May 21 headlined, "U.S. Analysts Link Iraq Labs to Germ Arms." Quoting 
anonymous officials they led with: "United States intelligence agencies have 
concluded that two mysterious trailers were mobile units to produce germs for 
weapons..."

<p>Their story continued: "The intelligence analysts judgment would support some 
of the evidence that Secretary of State Colin Powell presented on Feb. 5 to 
the United Nations."

<p>Over two weeks passed before the Times' reporters skeptically revisited the 
WMD issue -- and reversed the emphasis and tone of their May 21 report. Did 
Times' editors order the pair to re-consider? Executive Editor Howell Raines had 
left but Joseph Lelyveld had barely assumed the helm. Whatever the 
explanation, the Times and the tandem of Miller and Broad dramatically walked back the 
cat.

<p>In a front-page story on June 7 -- "Some Analysts Of Iraq Trailers Reject 
Germ Use" -- they executed this awkward journalistic turn: "American and British 
intelligence analysts with direct access to the evidence are disputing claims 
that the mysterious trailers found in Iraq were for making deadly germs." 
Their dissenting sources now said that "the mobile units were more likely intended 
for other purposes and charged that the evaluation process had been damaged 
by a rush to judgment."

<p>Noting that the Bush administration had claimed that the two trailers found 
in Iraq were evidence that Saddam had been hiding a program for biological 
warfare, they averred: "Now, intelligence analysts ... are disclosing serious 
doubts about the administration's conclusions in what appears to be a bitter 
debate within the intelligence community." A senior analyst told them that the 
white paper "was a rushed job and looks political."

<p>An editor's note appeared on the inside page at the bottom, noting that 
"Miller's agreement with the Pentagon for an 'embedded' assignment, allowed the 
military to review her copy to prevent breaches of troop protection and security. 
No changes were made in the review."

<p>Important questions about this flip-flop, bearing on credibility, remain

unanswered. Just who was a source for what -- the government for Miller or Miller 
for the government or all working together to maneuver backward on a winding 
trail of discredited reporting? Were Times' editors trying to belatedly look at 
the issue with a more skeptical eye?

<p>Surrounding this whole saga there is the smell of compromised reporting,

using and even colluding with tainted Iraqi sources, while essentially 
surrendering detached judgment to the Pentagon. The Times has a serious obligation to 
scrutinize Miller's reporting, and editors' editing, on the threat that was 
widely advertised as the primary reason for sending American and British soldiers 
off to war.
