<p> Mr. President, please attack Appalachia.  
<p>You have promised the Iraqis that they will share
in the wealth of their oil.  We could use some of that
same sharing here.  We have coal and timber that is
being extracted, yet very little of the profits remain
in our area.  If the Iraqis are to share in the
profits from their natural resources, we would like to
share in the profits from ours.   
<p>You have promised healthcare for all Iraqis.  We
could use the same thing here.  Far too many of us are
without health insurance and adequate access to good
healthcare facilities.  You have also promised to
rebuild the schools in Iraq.  We too have schools that
need rebuilt and that need more funding.
<p>Certainly you can find a justification for
attacking us.  We have weapons of mass destruction. 
Just go inspect the former uranium enrichment plant
near Piketon, Ohio.  You will still find all sorts of radioactive waste on and around that site.  Test our waters.  Test our ground.  Test our air.  You will find an abundance of chemical and biological agents that could be used as weapons.  We literally live
among them.    
<p>After all, Appalachia is America's third world. 
Terrorists are breeding everywhere.     Where there is
poverty there is unrest.  Where there is poor
education there is suspicion.  Where there is neglect
there is anger.  As far as potential dangers go,
Appalachia should be near the top of your list.  Stomp
out the bad before it turns thoroughly evil. 
Pre-emptively strike us now before it becomes too
late.  Do it before we make something else out of our
fertilizer ingredients.     
<p>Since Appalachia is a highly religious area an
attack could easily be explained as the fulfillment of prophecy.  Many here would even agree with your need to attack us.  In fact, we would probably help supply the troops.
<p>Without any long-term energy strategy or
alternative planning, once the oil is gone the US will
become increasingly dependent on coal and wood. 
Appalachia has lots of that.  Even today, the
profitability of many US businesses would be
threatened if Appalachia refused to supply them with electricity, coal, and other resources.
<p>Can America afford to wait until a crisis is at
hand before attacking Appalachia?  The decision is
yours.  You do not even have to involve the United
Nations since we are within US borders.  You can go it
alone.  
<p>The rest of the country will be fairly easy to
convince about the need to attack us.  The national
news media will surely rise to your side.  Prejudice
against hillbillies already devalues our lives in
comparison to those in the rest of the country, so our devastation and casualties would have to be nearly as high as in Iraq before anyone from outside Appalachia complains too loudly.  Besides, people here have lived as second-class citizens for so long we now thoroughly expect to be treated as second-class citizens - and the rest of the nation expects to treat us that way. 
How else could you explain the relatively small outcry currently raised by our exceedingly high unemployment rates, poor education, high pollution, poor healthcare, high poverty, and poor leadership?  
<p>In fact, attacking us will probably help cement
your re-election.  
<p>You might experience some local militia
counterstrikes, but those will probably be
disorganized and minor.  After all, Appalachia lacks
any central command, what with its being comprised of
the parts of twelve states and only the whole of one
state.  West Virginia could be your focus.  Find
someone evil there to target, such as Jay Rockefeller.
<p>He asked the FBI to investigate those forged
documents you used to help justify your war against
Iraq.  How embarrassing that must have been:
International Atomic Energy Agency Chief Mohamed
ElBaradei addressed the UN and publicly humiliated you
by showing your assertion that Iraq was trying to
import uranium from Niger was based on crudely faked information. Someone should pay for such an embarrassment and who better than a Democrat who is a Rockefeller?  
<p>So Mr. President, you have all the elements you
need: weapons of mass destruction, a nearly third
world enemy, potential terrorists, someone to call
evil, and an easy path to victory.  Now all you have
to do is attack.  And please, do it soon.  We need the reparations, better schools, better infrastructure, universal healthcare, and a fair share in the wealth of our own resources.
<p>You also promised Iraq democracy.  We could use
that here as well.  
<p>Please, Mr. President, attack Appalachia next.
