<p> President Bush's five-day, five-country tour
of Africa has had political observers wondering: is
this just another photo-op, crafted to show that the
President is not just a "bring them on," unilateralist gun-slinger but a "compassionate conservative?" Or does he intend -- for whatever political reasons -- to actually deliver something of substance?

<p> It should be known, first of all, how far the
United States and the rich countries as a group are
from actually helping the people of Africa more
than they are hurting them. If we look at the balance
of payments for Sub-Saharan Africa, there is an
annual net drain of more than $12 billion dollars out
of the region. This is about 4.4 percent of the
region's income, one of the highest such transfers
from South to North in the world. It is mostly debt
service.

<p> In other words, some of the world's poorest
countries are transferring a large amount of their
income -- even after taking into account the new
loans and grants that they get for development
assistance -- to the vastly richer North. This
includes their biggest creditors, the IMF and World
Bank. The transfer is more than these countries
spend for health care or education.

<p> This debt should be cancelled, as the most knowledgeable non-governmental organizations have argued.

<p> Even more urgently, Africa is suffering from
a horrible plague -- 29 million Africans have AIDS
or are HIV-positive. With only about 12 percent of
the world's population, the continent has 90 percent
(11 million) of the world's AIDS orphans. And
about 1.5 million Africans die each year from
tuberculosis and malaria.

<p> On the public health front, President Bush
has gotten credit for pledging $15 billion over five
years to help treat and prevent AIDS in Africa and
the Caribbean. But there are doubts about how
much of this money is going to materialize, and
when. One year ago the Administration promised
$500 million for prevention of HIV transmission
from mothers to newborn children, but no money
has yet been appropriated.

<p> The United States has joined the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and
-- in accordance with our income -- could be
expected to contribute at least $3.5 billion. But the administration has budgeted only $200 million for next year, less than 6 percent of our share, and $150 million less than the current year.

<p> The Bush Administration's efforts are also
corrupted by the influence of the pharmaceutical
industry. The big drug companies, backed by our
government, have fought tenaciously for years to
prevent people in poor countries from having access
to more affordable, generic drugs. This is a life-and-
death issue for millions of people: the drugs that
keep people with HIV/AIDS alive here cost $10,000
per year, but the Indian pharmaceutical industry
produces the generic equivalent for less than $250.
And it is not just AIDS that afflicts people in poor
countries: they also get heart disease, cancer,
diabetes, and many other ailments that are common
to human beings.

<p> The rich country governments have recently
made some compromises at the World Trade
Organization on these issues. But the Bush team is
trying to split Africa off from the hundreds of
millions of people in other developing countries
who have similar needs, and they are pressuring
other developing countries -- Brazil, the Philippines,
the Dominican Republic, and others -- for more
concessions to the drug companies.

<p> This costly protectionism -- the opposite of
free trade -- is bad for everyone. Africa's interest in
this matter is tied to those of other developing
countries in a number of ways: for example, the
generic drug producers sometimes need the latter's
markets for economies of scale, if they are going to
provide affordable drugs for the poorest countries.

<p> Americans also have a direct interest in the
outcome of this conflict. The same companies that
are blocking access to generic, life-saving
medicines for people in developing countries are
doing similar things on the home front. They have
fought for years to keep Medicare from including a
prescription drug benefit.

<p> They may have lost that battle, but their
monopoly pricing policies are making prescription
medicines increasingly unaffordable here. And so
are the enormous costs associated with "copycat
drug" research and development, advertising and
promoting drugs for inappropriate uses, legal costs
and other waste involved in the present patent
system.

<p> What the Bush Administration decides to do
about the health crisis in Africa will therefore affect
all of us -- much more than most people know.
