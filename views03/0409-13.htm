<p>If history's calendar were a landscape of memory, this would be a time surrounded by monoliths of deja vu.
<p>April 17 marks the anniversary of the first national march on Washington to protest the war in Vietnam. It was a Saturday in 1965, breezy and innocent as the marchers. About 20,000 streamed past the White House in orderly rows of threes and fours, their signs neatly printed and grammatically correct. President Johnson was vacationing at his ranch in Texas, but the peace marchers had their share of opponents: a dozen members of the American Nazi Party and several dozen members of the Delaware Valley Citizens for Victory over Communism. A Nazi was arrested after trampling a phonograph playing polka music (could you really blame him?) and a man describing himself as a "Hungarian freedom fighter" was arrested after making threatening gestures at the anti-war marchers. Even the incivility was low-cal.

<p>The peace movement had taken a while to get organized, mostly because liberals' trust in the Kennedy-Johnson White House was as blind then as conservatives' trust in the Bush White House is today. It wasn't until two years later, on April 4, 1967, that Martin Luther King Jr. finally spoke up against the war. He'd kept quiet until then, fearing that lending his voice to the anti-war movement would dilute his leadership of the civil rights movement. But it was an absurd separation of purpose, as he himself belatedly recognized: "Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read Vietnam." A prophetic warning that now begs repetition, with a change of venue.

<p>"Beyond Vietnam" is one of King's least-known, most powerful speeches, a 40-minute assault on the imperial arrogance of "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today -- my own government." It isn't the kind of speech that makes it into pupils' little portfolios during Black History Month, and certainly not the kind of Martin Luther King his piously correct admirers want to hear. This is King as mirror to America's horrors and indifference to decency even as it pretends to sow peace and justice in the lands it conquers. "They must see Americans as strange liberators," he'd said of Vietnamese. "Their questions are frighteningly relevant. Is our nation planning to build on political myth again and then shore it up with the power of new violence?"

<p>Military or historical comparisons between Vietnam and Iraq are indeed silly. Two vastly different countries, different peoples, different eras. But it is sillier still to suggest that no comparisons at all apply simply because some comparisons don't. There are serious, fundamental similarities, not between Vietnam and Iraq, but between American presumption in the 1960s and American presumption today, between President Johnson's imperial conceit then ("We can turn the Mekong into a Tennessee Valley") and Bush's messianic hubris now ("Operation Infinite Justice," "Operation Iraqi Freedom").

<p>The strength of King's speech isn't drawn only from its attack on America's Vietnam policy, his call on soldiers to refuse to serve in Vietnam or his appeal to dissenters "to match actions with words by seeking out every creative means of protest possible." The strength of the speech is rooted in its challenge of America's purpose beyond Vietnam, in a call for "a true revolution of values" that confronts "the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism" and the "glaring contrast of poverty and wealth" at home and "those conditions of poverty, insecurity and injustice abroad" that are the fertile grounds of what was then called communism, what is now called anti-Americanism. "The world now demands a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve."

<p>That was April 4, 1967. On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated -- the fourth of five assassinations between 1963 and 1968 that simultaneously confirmed America's legacy of violence and insured a leadership gap that afflicts the country to this day. With Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, John Kennedy, King and Robert Kennedy shot, it is no wonder the country became reactionary by default and then, with little opposition to prevent it, by design. There are no repetitions between the Aprils of the 1960s and April 2003. But there are enduring consequences and dispiriting contrasts.

<p>Something else happened on April 17, 1965, the day of the first anti-war march in Washington. While 12 F-105s dropped 36 tons of bombs on targets near the Laotian border, other planes dropped tons of leaflets on North Vietnam -- a speech by President Johnson about his "massive new effort to improve the lives of the people of Southeast Asia." That, too, is a monolith of deja vu, but the kind of monolith you see at the beginning of "2001: A Space Odyssey," that big, black, rectangular thing that suddenly appears in a prehistoric colony of bemused apes. In 2003, we are those apes.
