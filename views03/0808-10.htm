<p>On Tuesday, August 5,2003, the Sebastopol, CA City Council unanimously voted to send the following letter to President Bush.


<p>George W. Bush<br>
President of the United States<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW<br>
Washington, DC 20500

<p>Dear Mr. President:

<p>We write to you as elected representatives of the citizens of Sebastopol, California. As one of the 165 city councils thoroughout this country which passed resolutions opposing a preemptive strike against Iraq, we have serious concerns about the consequences of your decision to go to war.

<p>The cost to America of this war continues to mount - fiscally, morally, emotionally and in terms of our security. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians have been sacrificed for what you assured us was a necessary war to protect our national security. We have yet to see evidence of the urgent threat you repeatedly proclaimed. 

<p>As you know, cities and communities throughout America are facing a devastating fiscal crisis. The basic services which Americans expect from government, such as public safety, libraries, schools and roads, are provided at the local level.

<p>Without adequate funding these services will deteriorate or disappear. Recent GAO estimates place the cost of maintaining a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan at $4.9 billion per month. Had this money been allocated to our nation’s communities and cities we would not be facing our current crisis.

<p>Given that your argument for initiating a preemptive attack was based upon claims of a national security threat, we believe that you owe the American public satisfactory answers to the following questions:

<p>1. Beyond the NSC and CIA officials who have been identified, who else at the White House was involved in the decision to include the discredited Niger uranium evidence in your State of the Union speech, and, if they knew it was false, why did they permit it to be included in the speech?

<p>2. Why did your Administration persist in using the intercepted aluminum tubes to show that Iraq was pursuing a nuclear program and why did your National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, claim categorically that the tubes were "only really suited for nuclear weapons programs," when in fact our own government experts flatly rejected such claims?

<p>3. What was the basis was for Secretary Rumsfeld's assertion that the US had bulletproof evidence linking Al Qaeda to Iraq, despite the fact that U.S. intelligence analysts have consistently agreed that Saddam did not have a "meaningful connection" to Al Qaeda?

<p>4. What is the evidence for Vice President Cheney’s claim last September to have "irrefutable evidence" that Saddam Hussein had reconstituted his nuclear weapons program, an assertion he repeated in March, on the eve of war?

<p>5. What was the basis for Secretary Powell’s claim in February, before the UN Security Council, that, "Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets”?

<p>6. What is the evidence for Secretary Rumsfeld’s claim on March 30th, in reference to weapons of mass destruction, "We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat?"

<p>7. What are the true costs and long-term commitments of this war?

<p>8. Why did you incorrectly claim that the war began because Iraq would not admit UN inspectors, when in fact Iraq had admitted the inspectors and you opposed extending their work?

<p>9. Why did you persist in the plan to launch a preemptive strike against Iraq despite CIA Director Tenet’s warning that this would increase the risk of terrorist attacks against the people of the United States?

<p>10. Where is Osama Bin Laden?


<p>11. What is your plan to extricate America from Iraq?

<p>Mr. President, these are questions to which the American public deserves complete and honest answers. Your credibility as President and America’s credibility as a world leader depend upon your response.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Members of the Sebastopol City Council
<p> Craig Litwin, Mayor<br>
Robert Anderson, Councilmember<br>
Linda Kelley, Councilmember<br>
Sam Spooner, Councilmember<br>
Larry Robinson, Councilmember
