<p>Depending on which history you subscribe to, civilization began a few kilometers north of Nasiriyah where, in the shadow of the Tallil air base, a convocation of religious and tribal leaders, businessmen and soldiers gathered in an air-conditioned tent earlier this week to begin the process of reconstructing Iraq.

<p>Biblical Ur must have been quite something -- archaeological explorations of its ruins have confirmed the legends describing how the kings and queens of the ancient city drank from gold and silver beakers and wore daggers with golden blades. Ur is reckoned by many accounts to be the cradle of mankind, where Abraham, the father of Arabs and Jews, is supposed to have originated.

<p>However, I'm still not clear from this week's dispatches whether the American-led coalition is aware of the symbolism of locating the first meeting of a postwar Iraq near the ancient site. Ever since President George W. Bush uttered the C-word ("crusade") in the aftermath of 9/11, the religious impulses of Mr. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have been played down. But whether it is conscious or not, everything the coalition touches in Iraq seems to reverberate with religious and biblical tones.

<p>Mr. Bush may be wary these days of describing his designs for the Middle East as a crusade but you can just picture him late at night, after watching ESPN, poring over his Bible, the lights flashing in his head as he reads Genesis 12 -- "Now the Lord said to Abram, 'Go forth from your country, And from your relatives, And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great . . .' "

<p>The thought of George Bush as Abraham scuppers the analogy but there is a vacancy for a modern-day patriarch who will unite the diverse and divisive factions in Iraq. Ahmed Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi National Congress, seems to be the chosen one -- chosen by America that is. Mr. Chalabi was a notable absentee at this week's confab, however, opting instead to be airlifted to Baghdad -- which seems a strange decision if the convocation was as historic for the Iraqi people as the Americans are suggesting.

<p>It is futile trying to second-guess the horse-trading and backroom deals from this distance -- how much money is changing hands, who is being promised what -- but one question bothers me: Since the coalition is so keen to impress the world that the Iraqi people will decide the nature of their next government, how come it was the Americans who largely decided the Ur guest list? Shouldn't the Iraqi people be electing a sovereign national conference to decide the shape of their next dispensation?

<p>If the coalition genuinely cared about Iraqi democracy, it would have thought this through right down to details such as ensuring that the antiquities in Iraq's National Museum were safeguarded but, instead, U.S. forces stood by, ignoring the prewar warning and advice from UNESCO, as professional thieves made off with important artifacts of human history.

<p>As one wag wrote this week in the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper, "We wonder if we are facing an attempt to destroy Iraq's history, steal its memory and hide its identity's cultural and moral features, while keeping intact the oil."

<p>The other thing that struck me about the Ur convocation was the American description of it as an "unscripted, free-flowing forum of ideas," dominated by Iraqis talking, not Americans. Something about this triggers a red flag in my mind because this free-flowing forum of ideas seems to me the kind of context ripe for tactics of divide and rule.

<p>Because if the Iraqis were really free to choose their leadership, then you would expect that the kind of Iraq to emerge from such a dialogue would not be the kind of compliant pro-Western state that Washington is hoping for. Such a state might not only want a free hand in deciding who gets to lift Iraqi oil, but might also want to put the reconstruction of the country out to competitive tender. In the final analysis, a free Iraq would probably reflect the fact that 60 per cent of Iraqis are Shia Muslims and might have something to say about the religious convictions of their leader.

<p>Maybe we should look for clues to all this sophistry in the Good Book, because ancient Ur, with its towering ziggurats, was said to be the inspiration for the Tower of Babel. As Genesis 11 tells us, "The Lord said, 'behold, they are one people, and they have all one language . . . let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."

<p>One wonders if the looting and political cul-de-sacs are a pretext for installing an America-friendly administrator. It is not as if the Americans have never done such a thing, and anyone who understands the mechanics of neo-colonial politics will recognize the process.
