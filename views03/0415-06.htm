<p>Anyone who thinks war never does anyone any good has obviously never been to Gettysburg. It has made a fortune for an otherwise unremarkable southern Pennsylvanian town. There are dozens of other civil war battlefields, offering discreet tourism for the discerning and the obsessed, but Gettysburg is in a different league. 
<p>This is mainly due to the uniquely bloody (nearly 7,000 dead) and decisive nature of the encounter: once the Confederate general, George Pickett, had indulged the fashion, set by the British at Balaclava, for pointless uphill charges, the south's cause - though the end was nearly two years away - was essentially doomed. So now, even on the most dismal winter weekday, the town is full of school buses and camper vans; you can stay at the Battlefield Inn or the Drummer Boy campground, go on the Ghosts of Gettysburg tour, and eat heartily afterwards at General Pickett's All-U-Can-Eat Buffet restaurant. This may be contrasted with the British response to its own bloody internal history: historians are not even sure of the exact sites of the Battles of Bosworth or Naseby, and hardly anyone visits either. 
<p>Gettysburg also had a remarkable sequel. Five months later the great and good arrived to dedicate the burial ground. The main speaker was one Edward Everett, former governor of Massachusetts, who was deemed so important that the event was postponed because he needed longer to prepare his speech. Everett spoke for two hours, in the Periclean manner. As an afterthought, the president of the US had been invited to say a few words. Abraham Lincoln said 272 (the length of this column to here), which took him less than three minutes, and oratory was mercifully never the same again. 
<p>Nor was the civil war. For Lincoln's conclusion gave the war an overarching purpose: "That the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom, and that the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth." This was not Lincoln's original purpose, which was to preserve the union, but it has given the war an unarguable retrospective justification. 
<p>To that extent, there is an analogy with the Iraq war, where the liberation veneer was added belatedly to the original casus belli about weapons of mass destruction, which it seems Saddam literally could not use to save his life. But as American wars go, Iraq is far closer to the Mexican war of 1846, another adventure in which the result was preordained and the rationale fuzzy. 
<p>Historians will never agree on the true cause of this war; I doubt if it was ever wholly clear inside George Bush's head. As for its effect, the Law of Unintended Consequences may work either way: his intent might have been malign but the result could be to humanity's benefit, or vice versa. We shall see. On this one, I'm with Chou En-lai, Mao's inscrutable old sidekick, who when asked, circa 1972, what the effects of the French revolution had been, reputedly replied: "It's too soon to tell." 
<p>At last count the number of dead Americans in the war was 108, almost exactly the number who die every day in road accidents, and pretty close, I suspect, to the number the Pentagon privately predicted. The chances of knowing any one of these are remote, and the reporting of their funerals has been overshadowed by the wondrous stuff about returning prisoners, including - oh, heaven - a pretty female. I happened to catch an hour of al-Jazeera the other week. My limited Arabic means I have no idea whether the commentary was more or less biased than that on US TV. But the images were startlingly different, different even from those on the BBC, because they included a great many mangled dead bodies. Since they were Iraqi, they were not newsworthy here. 
<p>I have noted before how obsessed Americans now are with the second world war. In the New York Times a few months back the writer Anthony Giardina attributed this largely to the late Stephen Ambrose, whose annual books exulting wartime male bonding have given rise to other successful imitations both in print and, of course, on the screen. The appeal of the civil war has never faded. 
<p>War for many Americans has become something fascinating, glorious, satisfying, charmingly distant - as remote in its way as Gettysburg - and thus quasi-fictional. The sanitized entertainment provided for the last month has only enhanced its appeal. And by the time the reality of being liberated by Bush might become more apparent, as in Afghanistan, everyone will have lost interest. On to Syria then, and let's win there. Coming, Tone? </p>
