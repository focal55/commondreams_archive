<p>Americans don't like to distrust their leaders. In a world that appears so 
chaotic, one wants, needs, some sense of firm, unshakeable foundations. If we 
can't trust our cops, our priests, our corporate accountants, our elected 
officials, who will be there to provide that container of stability, our
sense that the world works and that we're not just victims waiting for the 
random finger of fate to tap us on the shoulder?

<p>I'm not just talking about other people here. I feel that way often.

<p>For a long time, even though I didn't vote for them -- and had anxieties
about their motives -- I didn't want to believe that the Bush Administration 
was all that bad, or had lied, or had done terrible things. I so believe in 
the goodness of this country and in its institutions -- especially in the 
Constitution that has served us so well for more than 200 years -- that I 
tried to avoid seeing the awful things being done in Washington, D.C.

<p>But when time after time, the facts revealed otherwise, I finally left the 
world of denial and moved into the world of sadness and disappointment
-- and 
anger. My government had been hijacked by those who cared hardly a wit for 
the genius of our Constitution, or for treating political opponents with
civility, or for the traditions of careful, respectful diplomacy abroad.

<p>It became more and more clear that the folks inhabiting the White House were 
not good people. Oh, they said publicly that their actions were being taken 
for all the right reasons -- freedom and liberty and the Constitution and to 
protect America -- and they certainly wrapped themselves not only in the flag 
but in religious-sounding trappings as well.  

<p>But their motives in private seemed mostly to involve a drive for profits for 
themselves and their corporate friends, and a seemingly insatiable lust for 
power and control. And all done in secret -- the most secretive 
Administration in modern times -- so that we wouldn't be able to  find out 
what they're really up to. 

<p>Rather than delve into the full list of economic, political, environmental 
and civil liberties catastrophes for which they're responsible, let's just 
focus today on Bush Administration foreign policies, since they involve the 
U.S. in military adventures that are potentially disastrous to our citizenry. 

<p>We're about to launch a "pre-emptive" war against Iraq -- without an overt 
provocation, without a large international coalition behind us, without 
United Nations authorization, without the support of most of Europe's 
populations (not even in Great Britain, our lone major supplier of troops), 
without the support of more than half of the U.S. citizenry, without the
support of Iraq's 22 fellow Arab countries, without the support of 
NATO-member Turkey, without even the support of the first President Bush's 
chief advisors, and without the support of many of America's military and 
intelligence leaders. In short, it's pretty much a unilateral White House 
operation, with a few hangers-on nations who don't want to risk angering the 
U.S.

<p>Given this strange situation, we had better damn well be clear on how we got 
to this place. Having some context will help us shape our thinking, our 
tactics, our strategies, in trying to stop the war before it begins. (And, if 
we're unsuccessful in doing that, in how to deal with the political and 
strategic necessities of opposing U.S. policy during a war.) Whichever way we 
go, we need to be  involved in helping build a Movement for peace and justice 
that will take back the country from the shadow forces currently in control.
<p>The Paper Trail
<p>The first thing to understand is that the true motivating factors for 
Bush&Co. policy in Iraq have precious little to do with Saddam Hussein's
weaponry. That is but the pretext, the cover story -- which, as you may have 
noticed, tends to shift daily. First it's "regime change"; then (so as not to 
frighten potential U.N. supporters) it's "disarmament of Iraq"; then, when 
Saddam moves in the direction of at least partial disarmament, it's "regime 
change" again; then it's "democracy" for Iraq and the region. But it's really 
smoke and mirrors, my friends. Let's see what is actually at play here.
<p>The Administration's stated reasons may flip on a dime -- how does Ari 
Fleischer do the daily flipping with a straight face? -- but a nation's major 
foreign policy doctrine doesn't arrive overnight, and certainly this one
didn't emerge full-grown from the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It had been in the 
works for quite some time, at least for a decade. 
<p>How can we be so sure? Well, it turns out that there's a long, highly visible 
paper trail that fills in the context. Let's take a look.
<p>During the years when Bill Clinton was struggling with the rising tide of 
conservatism in the House of Representatives, and then with fighting off the 
various "scandal" investigations, and then battling for his political life 
when he was impeached for lying about sex, the intellectual cadres of the 
HardRight were shaping a foreign policy for the next century.

<p>The situation was staring them in the face: There was a vacuum on the world 
scene. No more Superpower rival. The Soviet Union had collapsed of its own 
internal contradictions. The time was ripe for moving and taking in the 
world, as there was nobody and no force that could stop the U.S.

<p>The Foundations Are Laid

<p>A number of HardRight position papers and books spelled out the justification 
for the U.S. seizing the moment. Some of these you may have heard about 
already, others are less known. In all cases, the folks creating the imperial 
policy on paper are now creating and shaping the imperial policy for real 
inside the Bush Administration. 

<p>1. In 1992, then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had a report drafted for 
the Department of Defense, written by Paul Wolfowitz. In it, the U.S. 
government was urged, as the world's sole remaining Superpower, to move 
aggressively and militarily around the globe. Somehow, this report leaked to 
the press, and, since the objective political forces hadn't yet coalesced in 
the U.S. that could implement this policy free of resistance, President Bush 
the Elder repudiated the paper and withdrew it. (Wolfowitz, then 
undersecretry of defense for policy, is now Deputy Secretary of Defense;
Cheney, of course, now holds the title of Vice President.)

<p>2. Various HardRight intellectuals outside the government were spelling out 
the new policy in books and influential journals. Zalmay M. Khalilzad 
(formerly associated with big oil companies, currently U.S. Special Envoy to 
Afghanistan) wrote an important volume in 1995, "From Containment to Global 
Leadership: America & the World After the Cold War," the import of which was 
identifying a way for America to move aggressively in the world and thus to 
exercise effective control over the planet's natural resources. A year later, 
in 1996, neo-conservatives Bill Kristol (now editor of the rightwing Weekly 
Standard newspaper) and Robert Kagan, in their Foreign Affairs article 
"Towards a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy," came right out and said the goal 
for the U.S. had to be nothing less than "benevolent global hegemony," a
euphemism for total U.S. domination (but "benevolently" exercised, of
course.)

<p>3. In 1998, Kristol, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, out of nowhere, lobbied to 
convince President Clinton to attack Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein from
power. The January letter from the Project for the New American Century 
(PNAC), a HardRight think-tank founded the previous year, said that a war 
with Iraq should be initiated "even if the U.S. could not muster support from 
its allies in the United Nations." Sound familiar? (President Clinton replied 
that he was focusing on dealing with al Quaida terrorist cells.) 

<p>4. In September of 2000, the PNAC, sensing a GOP victory in the upcoming
presidential election, issued its white paper on "Rebuilding America's 
Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for the New Century." These were no 
lightweight pundits; these guys were (and are) the heavy-hitting movers and 
shakers of far-right Republican strategy, including: Dick Cheney, Donald
Rumsfeld, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Bill Kristol, Eliot Abrams, John 
Bolton, I. Lewis Libby, et al.  

<p>The 2000 PNAC report was quite frank about why the U.S. would want to move 
toward imperialist militarism, a Pax Americana, because with the Soviet Union 
out of the picture, now is the time most "conducive to American interests and 
ideals...The challenge of this coming century is to preserve and enhance this 
'American peace'." And how to preserve and enhance the Pax Americana? The 
answer is to "fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major-theater 
wars."

<p>In serving as world "constable," the PNAC went on, no other countervailing 
forces will be permitted to get in the way. Such actions "demand American 
political leadership rather than that of the United Nations," for example. No 
country will be permitted to get close to parity with the U.S. when it comes 
to weaponry or influence; therefore, more U.S. military bases will be 
established in the various regions of the globe. (A post-Saddam Iraq may well 
serve as one of those advance military bases.)
 
<p>5. George W. Bush moved into the White House in January of 2001. Shortly

thereafter, a report by the Administration-friendly Council on Foreign 
Relations was prepared ("Strategic Energy Policy Challenges for the 21st
Century") that advocated a more aggressive U.S. posture in the world and
called for a "reassessment of the role of energy in American foreign policy," 
with access to oil repeatedly cited as a "security imperative." (It's 
possible that inside Cheney's energy-policy papers -- which he refuses to 
release to Congress or the American people -- are references to 
foreign-policy plans for how to gain military control of oilfields
abroad.)

<p>6. Five hours after the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks, Secretary of Defense 
Rumsfeld ordered his aides to begin planning for an attack on Iraq, even
though his intelligence officials told him it was an al Qaida operation and 
there was no connection between Iraq and the attacks. "Go massive," the 
aides' notes quote him as saying. "Sweep it all up. Things related and not." 
(In the past year, Rumsfeld leaned heavily on the FBI and CIA to find any 
shred of evidence linking the Iraq government to 9/11, but they weren't able 
to. So he set up his own fact-finding group in the Pentagon, with similar 
results.)
 
<p>7. Feeling confident that all plans were on track for moving aggressively in 
the world, the Bush Administration in September of 2002 published its 
"National Security Strategy of the United States of America." The official 
policy of the U.S. government, as proudly proclaimed in this major document, 
is virtually identical to the policy proposals in the various white papers of 
the Project for the New American Century and others like it over the past 
decade. 

<p>Chief among them are: 1) the policy of "pre-emptive" war -- i.e., whenever 
the U.S. thinks a country may be amassing too much power and/or could provide 
some sort of competition in the "benevolent global hegemony" sweepstakes, it 
can be attacked, without provocation. (A later corollary would rethink the 
country's atomic policy: nuclear weapons would no longer be considered 
defensive, but could be used offensively in support of political/economic 
ends.) And, 2) ignoring international treaties and opinion whenever they are 
not seen to serve U.S. imperial goals.

<p>In short, and stated proudly to the public, the Bush Administration seems to 
see the U.S. as a New Rome, an empire with its foreign legions (and threat of 
nuclear weapons) keeping the outlying colonies, and potential competitors, in 
line. Those who aren't fully in accord with these goals better get out of the 
way; "you're either with us or against us."

<p>The Bush Drool

<p>Which brings us back to Iraq. Bush is like a drooling, fixated hounddog on 
scent; other vital crises may be exploding all around him (North Korea's
increasingly bellicose nuclear-missile strategy, the U.S. economy in 
tatters), but his eyes and nose are locked onto Direction Baghdad.
<p>Bush risks doing irreparable harm to America's short- and long-term economic, 
political and military interests, but, damn it, Saddam is still in Baghdad 
and he's gotta go. No second attack front via Turkey? Forget it, Saddam's 
gotta go. No support from the rest of the world? Ignore it, Saddam's gotta 
go. Why? Because America's foreign/military policy -- its goals of dominance 
and control of natural resources  -- requires it. Don't bother me, I'm 
eatin'.  
<p>So, unless some amazing event occurs in the next several weeks -- a worldwide 
boycott aimed at  U.S. economic interests, Saddam having a heart attack (or 
going into exile in Las Vegas), North Korea launching a nuclear missile at 
Kuwait, the courts ruling that only the Congress has the right to declare war 
-- hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will head into the Persian Gulf 
desert, after the "Shock & Awe" cruise-missile bombardment, to locate and 
decapitate the Iraqi leader and to "protect" the oilfields "on behalf of the 
Iraqi people" (not).  
<p>Tens of thousands of civilians and military personnel likely will die or be 
maimed. Dissent inside the U.S. will make the Vietnam era look like a beach 
party. Terrorism will explode worldwide, especially inside America. The U.S. 
will be more and more isolated. The economy will tank. A global recession or 
depression will follow. 

<p>And why? Because a few HardRight ideologues, most of whom have never been to 
war, decided more than a decade ago to start a conflagration in the Persian 
Gulf that the U.S. could profit from, both monetarily and in terms of 
dominating power. It's disgraceful. It's disgusting. It may even be 
impeachable.
