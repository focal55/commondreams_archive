<p>Timothy Treadwell was like a lot of Californians. He would live the life he wanted, and to hell with natural dangers. That's why he came West.

<p>Treadwell, 46, a bartender from Malibu, liked to live among Alaska grizzlies and last summer talked friend Amie Huguenard, 37, into joining him. Rangers at Katmai National Park warned him, but Treadwell understood bears.

<p>Early last month, he set up camp on a bear trail, and on Oct. 5 a bear took exception, killing him and Huguenard and partially devouring them. 

<p>We push the envelope in California, home to 35 million people, most of them in the Southland, which has no water. We build on earthquake faults, floodplains and ocean cliffs. Ocean views are worth millions until homes collapse into the sea, as in Malibu, Pacific Palisades and Encinitas.

<p>We start huge new developments where there is no water, as at Newhall Ranch, near Santa Clarita, the largest development in Los Angeles County history. Some 20,000 acres of Newhall burned last week, though no houses have yet been built. By the next fire, Newhall should have all its planned 20,885 homes, and we can watch them burn.

<p>We push into the foothills, canyons and mountains. Los Angeles County abandoned zoning a half-century ago to develop the Santa Monica, San Gabriel and Santa Susana Mountains. The mania spread into the so-called Inland Empire, stretching from Pomona and San Bernardino to Temecula and home to 4 million people, with the affluent pushing up the mountains.

<p>Mountains are like apartment buildings: The higher, the better.

<p>Mountain villages like Big Bear and Arrowhead have become small cities. Westward, around Simi Valley and Santa Clarita, the Santa Susana Mountains have sprouted full communities. In San Diego County, all the mountains have been invaded. To trace the ring of mountains around Southern California from Ventura to Mexico is to trace the fires that attacked us.

<p>The Paradise fire, covering some 60,000 acres as of Friday around Valley Center, raged through an area still largely unpopulated when the 1970 Laguna fire swept across the county.

<p>The Cedar fire, covering some 275,000 acres by the weekend, began in the backcountry south of Ramona. One front rode the Santa Ana winds along the tree lines into Scripps Ranch and Poway, then south along the hillsides to Santee, El Cajon and Lakeside. A second front swept down the Cuyamaca Mountains south and east, toward Julian and Descanso, obliterating the town of Cuyamaca. 

<p>What is California to do? People keep coming (50 million projected for 2020), pushing deeper into mountains parched with drought climate. Our mountains are not like those of Oregon, Vermont or Switzerland, verdant from ample rain. In Los Angeles County, they cut down trees to develop the mountains and now fear landslides.

<p>Pick your poison: With trees gone, winter rains bring mudslides; as firefighters battled in Simi Valley, small earthquakes struck the region, but monitoring stations had been knocked out by the fires.

<p>Solutions are hard because the problem is worse. When ursophile Treadwell was born, in 1957, state population was 14,177,000, and California was still a livable place. Thanks to water projects, the Southland's water was becoming sufficient. Forest fires, the inevitable consequence of our flora and climate, were not guaranteed human disasters because, unlike Treadwell, people stayed off the path.

<p>Environment had not yet become the enemy. Californians still named schools after Luther Burbank, the visionary botanist who came here from Massachusetts and wrote home (in Lake Wobegonesque language): "I believe that this is the chosen spot of all this earth as far as nature is concerned, and the people are far better than the average."

<p>As these fires are extinguished, the politicians have already begun their pathetic dueling over who and what to blame: state vs. federal vs. local, Democrats vs. Republicans, forest thinners vs. chaparral thinners, South vs. North, helicopters vs. firetrucks.

<p>These arguments do not get to the basic issue, which is too many people crowding into rural eco-systems unable to support them. We have built the wrong way in California, sprawling into the mountains, deserts and coastlines, letting inner-city cores disintegrate, giving little thought to preserving the gifts we inherited.

<p>"As long as I live," wrote John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club more than a century ago, "I'll interpret the rocks, learn the language of flood, storm and avalanche. I'll acquaint myself with the glaciers and wild gardens, and get as near the heart of the world as I can."

<p>In San Diego, the Rural Lands Initiative, which will be on the March ballot, would ban sprawl in remote county areas, helping to preserve the streams, lakes and forests – and minimize future human fire disasters – by establishing minimum lot size.

<p>The developers will spend heavily against it, for they would build out every inch of land if they could, but it is a common sense initiative.

<p>The shock of these latest fires can help us understand how to keep a bad situation from becoming worse.
