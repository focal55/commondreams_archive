<p>Events have suddenly and unexpectedly handed the Democratic Party an 
opportunity to defeat George W. Bush in 2004. His main justifications 
for his war in Iraq (existence of weapons of mass destruction, 
connections with Al Qaeda) have collapsed, while the war itself 
intensifies. At home, his tax cuts have sent deficits out of control 
and jobs are disappearing at a gallop. Each of these conditions seems 
likely to be either chronic or permanent: The prospect of finding 
actual weapons of mass destruction, though conceivable, has dimmed to 
the vanishing point; the cost in blood and treasure of the occupation 
seems likely to increase; the deficit is likely to remain high or get 
higher. On other issues-healthcare, the environment, education-the 
public trusts Democrats more than it does the President. His poll 
numbers have fallen, from the high sixties and mid-seventies a month 
or two ago to the mid-fifties today.

<p>But it's one thing for Bush to fail, another for the Democrats to 
succeed. Debate within the party is sharpening. The questions for the 
antiwar wing of the party are especially acute. In a winner-take-all 
electoral system like ours, anyone who holds views that are outside 
the mainstream is faced with an obvious and inescapable dilemma: 
Should one vote for a candidate one agrees with wholeheartedly but 
seems likely to lose the election or vote for a candidate one doesn't 
much care for but seems likely to win? Which is worse, a noble defeat 
or an empty victory?

<p>I can give myself as an example. I opposed the war in Iraq before it 
was launched and now regard it as a mounting disaster, with the worst 
yet to come. But according to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal 
poll, 69 percent of the public still think the war was worth it. 
Obviously, I'm out of step with the public. The candidate who best 
reflects my views is Dennis Kucinich. He not only opposed-and still 
opposes-the war; he wants to cut the Pentagon budget and shift the 
direction of American foreign policy toward peace and cooperation 
with the rest of the world. Second best from my standpoint is Howard 
Dean, who also opposed the war but now wants the United States to 
stay the course and keep Pentagon spending at present levels. Dean, 
as everyone knows, has been gaining support and appears to have a 
real chance to win the nomination. So, for me, Kucinich would be the 
more principled choice, Dean the more pragmatic choice. Yet Dean's 
views on the war, too, are outside mainstream opinion and could doom 
him in the general election. The cautionary example usually given is 
George McGovern, who rightly opposed the war in Vietnam in 1972 but 
lost to Richard Nixon in a landslide. Ever since, the Democratic 
Party has been running away from "McGovernism."

<p>Other candidates propose to dive deliberately and immediately into 
the mainstream. One is Joseph Lieberman. In his words, the party must 
"go right up the middle." He says anyone who (like Dean) "was opposed 
to the war against Saddam, who has called for the repeal of all of 
the Bush tax cuts &quot;could lead the Democratic Party into the political 
wilderness." Lieberman himself probably believes that the war was 
right, and that full repeal of the tax cuts would be wrong, but in 
this appeal he is clearly asking those of us who disagree with him to 
forget our beliefs and support him on purely pragmatic grounds. "The 
middle," of course, is, of mathematical necessity, the place that any 
candidate must be in if he is to win. And it's easier to move to the 
mainstream than to move the mainstream to you. (On the other hand, 
selling your principles for power doesn't always work. Quite often 
there are no buyers for the tarnished goods. President Clinton was 
admittedly a master of the art; but Lieberman doesn't seem to have 
the knack. You do not get to the middle by trumpeting "I am in the 
middle." You do it by saying things people in the middle like to 
hear. Claims to be in the middle are inside baseball, not the game 
itself. When candidates step up to the plate, they should swing at 
the pitch, not give commentaries on their batting technique.)

<p>As it happens, McGovern, not merely a historical figure but a living 
person, and a thoughtful and articulate one at that, has jumped into 
the discussion. Calling the warnings against McGovernism "political 
baloney," he comments that although in 1972 he won only Massachusetts 
and the District of Columbia, "no war could have continued long after 
that election." He is suggesting that although the movement against 
the Vietnam War, of which his campaign was a powerful expression, 
never put a President in office, it nevertheless forced an end to the 
war. His point is that political influence can be exerted in more 
than one way: "Give me a presidential candidate who speaks the truth 
as he sees it, and I'll show you a candidate whose campaign, win or 
lose, will be good for the nation."

<p>Other episodes in American history teach a similar lesson. When 
Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he had the 
support of both Houses of Congress, including a majority of 
Republicans. But the politically acute President saw that the triumph 
had an immense future electoral cost attached. "I think we just gave 
the South to the Republicans," he commented. And indeed, in years to 
come the GOP, following the "Southern strategy" adopted by the same 
Richard Nixon who defeated McGovern, won the South from the 
Democrats, laying the basis for successes in the next several 
elections. And so even as civil rights was winning substantively, it 
lost politically. The public accepted the message but rejected the 
messengers, as it would also do with McGovern. Yet the victory was 
real: The nation was changed for the better. The national holiday 
born of the movement is Martin Luther King Day, not Richard Milhous 
Nixon Day. There will never be a Richard Milhous Nixon Day. Neither 
will there probably be a George McGovern Day, but posterity will 
honor him.

<p>These episodes do not necessarily teach Democrats whom to vote for in 
2004, but they do suggest some lessons. Victory does not come through 
the ballot box alone. It sometimes comes by circuitous paths. 
Electoral politics should be played to win, yet changing hearts and 
minds can at times be as important as changing the President. 
McGovern is right. When in doubt, it's best to err on the side of 
speaking the truth.
