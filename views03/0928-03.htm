<p>Earlier this month, a 9,500-man-strong multinational division moved into 
a 30,000-square-mile zone in south-central Iraq. It serves under Polish 
command.
<P>Sandwiched for centuries between Germany and Russia, a victim of both Nazis 
and communists, no country in Europe is more pro-American than Poland. As they 
say in Warsaw, the experience of the 20th century taught Poles that their only 
true friends in Europe are Americans.
<P>On the eve of the strike at Saddam Hussein, when major West European cities 
filled up with anti-American demonstrators, Poles and citizens of other infant 
democracies of Central Europe took a strong pro-U.S. stand. Contrary to the 
cynical view, they did so not to please the White House and win American 
largesse, but because they understand better than the French, the Germans or 
the Belgians what repression and tyranny mean. They did so risking the not-so-
subtle anger of powerful neighbors.
<P>While most people in Warsaw, Budapest and Vilnius found the language coming 
from Washington to be unnecessarily bellicose, Poles saw the U.S. position on 
Iraq as the only realistic way to enforce compliance with previous U.N. 
resolutions and offer the Middle East a chance for better future. The Polish 
parliament, which squabbles on practically any domestic issue, unanimously 
supported the government's decision to send troops to Iraq.
<P>But that was then, before the war started. Today, America's friends in 
Warsaw are much more apprehensive and concerned. Some go as far as to say that 
while the U.S. military credibility has never been as high as today, its 
political credibility has never been as shaky.
<P>While Paris, Berlin and Brussels continue to question the wisdom, the 
legitimacy and intentions of the U.S. presence in Iraq, and welcome grim news 
from Baghdad with a mixture of shadenfreude and "I told you so," people of 
Central Europe seem to be surprised, puzzled, and saddened by the unexpected 
difficulty of the mission. Their trust in the omnipotence of the United States, once rock solid and bordering on naivete, is giving way to disappointment and 
confusion.
<P>Traditional admiration of America's might and its instincts, is being 
replaced in Warsaw by curiosity about what went wrong, as well as why and how 
it went wrong. The Poles suffer from exactly the same syndrome that afflicts 
the U.S. public -- a crisis of mismanaged expectations. However, unlike many 
other nations, often watching with disbelief from afar, they have quite a lot 
at stake.
<P>Given the size of the Polish military contingent in Iraq of 2,400 men, it 
may be only a matter of days before the first body of a Polish soldier is 
flown back home. That would only amplify a question, already frequently asked, 
whether the United States is executing truly the best, the most imaginative 
and realistic game plan to deal with the threat of global terrorism.
<P>Last week, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser under 
President Jimmy Carter and the a son of a Polish diplomat, published in a 
popular Warsaw daily an article titled "America and Europe After September 11. 
Destined for Cooperation."
<P>Advocating a stronger and more constructive transatlantic dialogue, 
Brzezinski offered readers a glimpse of what has gone astray in Washington. He 
says that as a result of two separate national security teams -- the formal 
one, headed by Condoleezza Rice, and a second one, led by Vice President Dick 
Cheney -- competing for President Bush's ear, the very process of formulating 
the U.S. foreign policy has become a source of confusion.
<P>The picture that emerges is one of a policy shaped not so much by a 
cohesive and comprehensive strategy, as one driven partly by events, partly by 
personal ambitions and partly by internal bureaucratic pressures. Not a 
reassuring image for a young ally sending its soldiers into harm's way.
<P>The Polish presence in Iraq may look modest. But, America's friends in 
Warsaw say, if Iraq were to succumb to bloody chaos, it would be a catastrophe 
for Poland. It would give credence to domestic and external critics who 
portray the country as a pawn in the hands of a superpower.
