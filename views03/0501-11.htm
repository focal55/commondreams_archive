<p>Any good salesperson will tell you: stop asking
open-ended questions.  Define the playing field. 
Determine the options.  Control the possible outcomes.
 Limit responses to choices between one option or
another.  Never take no for an answer.  Always be
selling.  Make you point clear and make it over and
over again.  Repeated statements eventually become
accepted and unquestioned.
<p>Liberals make lousy salespeople.  They compulsively
give both sides of a story.  They explain the downside
as well as the upside.  They consider and respect
other's viewpoints, thus becoming prone to poor
productivity and time-management issues.  They display reluctance at asking for the sale and easily grow bored with repeating the same pitch over and over. 
Liberals have noticeable problems selling products in
which they do not personally believe.
<p>Even when liberals are passionately committed to
what they are selling, they tend to confuse their
clients with too many statistics and too much
supporting information.  They overanalyze.  Clients
become overwhelmed, uncertain, distracted, suspicious,
and ultimately disinterested.  Liberals often avoid
forcing their clients to reach a decision for fear of
making them feel uncomfortable or pressured.  In fact,
they will even accept "let me think about it" as a
legitimate answer.  
<p>Some people are just too honest to make a decent
living selling life insurance.
<p>Successful salespeople are not always the most
intelligent or the most ethical.  But they are usually
the most driven.  They know what they want, they do
what they need to do to get it, and desire more once
they have it.  Because they embrace their personal
goals, they work tirelessly.  They remain focused   
<p>They understand that those who want it the most
win.
<p>Take President Bush.  While his detractors were
busy explaining all sorts of reasons why invading Iraq
would be unwise, immoral, illegal, illegitimate, and
counter to everything Americans hold dear, he seized
control of the discussion.  Instead of being
distracted by arguments that the war was actually
about oil, strategic positioning, empire building,
protecting the dollar, or expanding American business interests, he gave people the option: either attack Iraq preemptively or wait until their evil leader builds his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to
the point that he attacks America first.   
<p>Mr. Bush did not bog anyone down with facts and
figures.  He repeated his selling points over and over
again until he closed the deal.  
<p>Once the war began Mr. Bush again clearly defined
the option for Americans and other nations: either
support the US invasion and help liberate the Iraqi
people or support Saddam Hussein and a continuation of
the past atrocities of his regime.
<p>Mr. Bush created a straightforward closed-ended
question: are you with us or against us?  Meanwhile,
his detractors bogged themselves down in ideological
analyses regarding international implications and our democracy's future.  They again lost the interest of the public with far too many details and in-depth arguments.
<p>Liberals think too much and, as a result, ask their
clients to think too much.  They make appeals based on intangibles, ideals, and values.  Good salespeople will incorporate lofty and impressive sounding words and phrases, but they will understand that the sale must ultimately be consummated based on more concrete issues.  The client wants to know "what's in it for me?"  Successful salespeople will convince clients that their lives will be immediately better off once they make the purchase.  
<p>Mr. Bush sold safety and security.  He sold
protection of the American lifestyle.  He sold
entitlement: his supporters now believe only they
should share the spoils of war.
<p>Already the Bush administration has begun making
new sales pitches.  They are threatening Syria, Iran,
North Korea, and even France.  They are hyping new tax
cuts for the wealthy that are also supposed to help
the poor and the economy.  They are calling for a
Patriot Act II, further subversions of international agreements, and additional restrictions on environmental protections.
<p>While his detractors bemoan the need to discredit
yet another outrage, Mr. Bush relentlessly moves
forward.  While his opposition tires from re-fighting
the same old fights they once thought they had won and
from readdressing the same issues, injustices, and
attacks again and again, Mr. Bush persists.  
<p>His energy and stamina are truly impressive.
<p>Such strength results from his single-minded
determination to achieve clearly defined objectives. 
His total commitment to forwarding the agendas of big
business and America's most wealthy enables him to
sell his initiatives even to the vast majority of
Americans who such agendas will ultimately severely
harm.  
<p>Such is the power of great salesmanship.
