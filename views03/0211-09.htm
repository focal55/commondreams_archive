<p>These days, you'll hear plenty of voices for war. But
not many voices for peace.

<P>Bush rattling a saber can make headlines all day. What
can a person of peace rattle? I mean, besides Bush's
conscience.

<P>So, in these times of orange alert, let me introduce
you to two unique American voices you should know
about.

<P>They both want more time for inspections and a more
humanitarian way of dealing with any threat Iraq might
pose.

<P>One is a nun who's a lawyer. (Go ahead, try to name
another one.  Sally Field played a nun who flew but
didn't sue. Others may have acted as prosecutors during
your youth, but that was just habit).  Sister Simone
Campbell is a bona fide barrister who can take you to
court for bad behavior.

<P>The other is Kawal Ulanday, an Asian American of
Filipino descent who just got a visit from the FBI -- one that can serve as
a message for
you, and for any others out there who rattle for
peace too loudly.

<P>Because I'm a good Catholic, let's begin with the nun.

<P>Sister Simone Campbell practiced poverty law in
Oakland for 18 years, then moved to Sacramento to
become executive director of Jericho, an interfaith
group that lobbies politicians on issues such as health
care, welfare and affordable housing.

<P>Sister Simone was unimpressed by Secretary of State Colin Powell's
U.N. presentation the other day.

<P>"If we've had information we've been holding on to,
the inspectors should have had it, and they should
have checked it out," she said. "And those unnamed
sources ...

<P>"He didn't convince me," Sister Simone added. "But I've been there, so I'm
probably harder to convince."

<P>Concerned that the government seems to be diverting money from
domestic issues and applying it to preparations for war, Sister Simone
decided she
needed to go to Iraq as a witness.

<P>While the media followed Blix and the gang, Sister
Simone's religious group went to see how people live
in Baghdad and Basra.

<P>"We went as a spiritual journey," said Sister Simone.
"But we had to be open that we might find things that
support the war. We heard that the Iraqi people wanted
the U.S. to liberate them. So, if we found that out,
we'd have to say that.

<P>"But that's not what we found."

<P>No liberation necessary?

<P>"Not by the United States, and not by war," said Sister
Simone. "People would come up to us on the streets
because they heard us speaking English. Every person
we talked to said, 'Please, let's have peace. Can't
there be a way we can talk?' There was a great fear
and apprehension about war and a real desire for
peace. And an end to sanctions."

<P>The infamous U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990 after
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Unfortunately, they have
worked all too well. Not on Hussein, but on the Iraqi
people.

<P>"The closest thing to anyone wanting liberation is a
man who said he just wanted it over because we are
killing them slowly with sanctions," said Sister Simone.
"'You might as well bomb us,' is what he said."

<P>Sister Simone called witnessing the sanctions at work
"horrific" and claimed they have worked in unintended
ways. More than 1 million Iraqis have died -- 500,000 of them
children -- because of U.N. policies that have
destroyed the country's water supply. She recalled
seeing raw sewage in the rivers. Thousands unemployed.

<P>So, why haven't the people revolted against Hussein?

<P>"The irony is, the sanctions have preserved Hussein's
power," said Sister Simone. "If 70 percent depend on
the government for employment and 40 percent depend on
the government for their sole source of nutrition,
they're not about to risk changing the government."

<P>Yet, to her surprise, Sister Simone did find some Iraqis
willing to criticize Hussein openly. Just not enough of
them to overthrow him. "They called him 'the Big
Guy,'" she said.

<P>With the prospects of a war, she saw the Iraqi people
as an afterthought, caught in the middle in a dispute
between the United States and Hussein.

<P>"I'm terrified how they'll end up," she said. "War is
not just one person."

<P>Going to Iraq convinced her of that.

<P>She's heartened that the pope has agreed to meet Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Feb. 14.

<P>Maybe George Bush should, too.

<P>As Sister Simone and I ended our conversation, I wondered what the
president who quoted somberly from Isaiah after the
space shuttle Columbia accident might say when the first body bags
of Americans return from the Gulf.

<P>A preemptive strike will be a choice, not an accident.

<P>Another person of peace you should know about is Kawal
Ulanday.

<P>In the Asian-American community, he works as a
professional conscience. If you don't have one, you
can borrow his. If you don't feel like taking action,
he'll act on your behalf.

<P>He's a member of the steering committee of the Asian and Pacific
Islander Coalition Against the War and belongs to
the Filipinos for Global Justice Not War Coalition.

<P>And that's just some of the groups he's affiliated
with.

<P>On Jan. 20, Ulanday got a "home visit" from agents of the FBI's
Joint Terrorism Task Force.

<P>As a "pro," Ulanday knows what you should do if you
get a knock on the door from the FBI. He knows you
have a right to remain silent. And that anything you
say can be used against you -- or somebody else.

<P>But Ulanday talked to the FBI anyway.

<P>"I was just caught off guard," he told me. "It was the
day before my brother's funeral service. We had so
many people at my house because it was a time of
loss.  I knew I just needed to cooperate at a time
when my family's needs were paramount."

<P>See, even activists have priorities.

<P>The FBI knew Ulanday had no criminal record. In
fact, they knew all the answers they asked him: Were
you born in Mindanao? Are you Muslim? Do you have any
connection with any Muslim extremist groups connected
to al Qaeda? Are you anti-American?

<P>The answers to all the questions were no, of course.
But this visit wasn't about getting information.

<P>"It was clear they were sending a message," said
Ulanday. "That Big Brother was watching -- not just me,
but a rapidly growing peace movement of countless
individuals, groups and alliances who share a popular
people's sentiment against a looming war in Iraq."

<P>If it was intimidation, it didn't work.

<P>"I'm still going forward," he told me. "I'm not
intimidated at all.  If anything, I'm definitely
stronger."

<P>That's an activist talking.  But what about you, and
others?

<P>Will intimidation silence others who question the
actions of our democracy?  Or will you have the
courage to be like Sister Simone and Ulanday, two
voices rattling about peacefully while others bang
away for war?
