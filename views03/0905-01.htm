<p>Attorney General John Ashcroft marked the two-year anniversary of the
   terrorist attacks of September 11 by launching a national publicity
   tour to sell Americans on the USA Patriot Act. That he felt the need
   to do so was itself revealing. The act is, of course, already law,
   and when it came to a vote just six weeks after the 9/11 attacks only
   a single senator (Russell Feingold) and sixty-six members of the
   House voted against it (even though almost no one had had time to
   read the 342-page bill before voting). But the act has come under
   increasing grassroots criticism ever since--more than 150 towns,
   cities and states have enacted ordinances condemning it--and the
   Justice Department finds itself on the defensive.

<p>Even more telling, however, is the fact that Ashcroft's national tour
   will not address the public. His speaking engagements are all before
   closed audiences, primarily law-enforcement officers. The choice to
   speak to police and exclude the people captures much of the flavor of
   the Administration's war on terrorism: It has repeatedly sought to
   maximize police power while minimizing public oversight. But that
   tactic may be backfiring, as the American people are starting to
   fight back [see David Sarasohn, page 23].

<p>The Administration has done everything in its power to duck scrutiny
   of its actions. In the initial weeks after the attacks it arrested
   hundreds of people in secret, and it has continued to fight to keep
   their names secret, despite an Inspector General's report in June
   revealing that virtually all those arrested have been cleared of any
   connection to terrorism. It held secret trials for all those held on
   immigration charges and then staved off Supreme Court review of the
   practice, telling the Court that the trials had been completed and
   therefore there was no need to find whether the practice was
   constitutional (one court of appeals had declared it
   unconstitutional; another had upheld it).

<p>The Administration has also opposed any judicial review of its
   detention of the more than 650 foreign nationals held incommunicado
   in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, without charges, hearings or trials.
   And it initially argued that American citizens declared "enemy
   combatants" were similarly barred from seeking court review,
   abandoning that view only after the courts rejected it. Now it argues
   that the only "review" a court can exercise vis-&agrave;-vis citizens
   is a highly deferential perusal of a written declaration filed by a
   midlevel government functionary. The courts may not hear evidence
   from the detainee and may not look into the declaration's statements
   to determine whether they're true. According to the Administration,
   there is literally no opportunity for a person to present evidence
   that would prove his innocence.

<p>The Administration has invoked a similarly one-sided process in its
   attacks on Muslim charities. It has frozen the assets of three of the
   country's largest, alleging that they have ties to terrorist groups.
   But when one of them--the Holy Land Foundation--produced evidence
   showing that the government's claims were false, the government moved
   to keep the evidence out of court, arguing that the charity had no
   right to present new evidence and that the court should uphold the
   government's actions on its evidence alone.

<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), greatly expanded
   by the Patriot Act and heavily relied upon by the Justice
   Department since
   9/11, is even more one-sided [see Steven Donziger, page 24]. It
     allows the government to conduct secret searches of "foreign
     agents" in criminal investigations without establishing probable
     cause of criminal activity, which the Fourth Amendment generally
     requires before a warrant can be issued. The fruits of these
     searches can be used in criminal trials, but the law does not
     permit those against whom the evidence is used access to the
     original search-warrant application, rendering illusory any review
     of the search's validity.

<p>The Administration has also used less formal measures to limit review
   of its actions. It has moved three detained "enemy combatants" to
   South Carolina, attempting to insure that any legal challenges would
   be heard in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's most
   conservative. It has reportedly threatened defendants with onerous
   sanctions, including implications that they might be declared enemy
   combatants. These threats have helped prosecutors secure guilty pleas
   and avoid trials even where defendants have strong constitutional
   defenses. In Lackawanna, New York, for example, six young men who had
   attended an Al Qaeda training camp pleaded guilty to violating a law
   that another court in New York has since declared unconstitutional.

<p>So why, given this history of secrecy and obfuscation, the sudden
   desire to launch a publicity tour? The Administration apparently
   fears the tide may be turning, and there are increasing signs its
   concerns are warranted. A May CBS News poll found that 52 percent of
   Americans were "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned" about losing
   their civil liberties at the hands of the Administration. Democratic
   presidential candidates are competing over who can criticize Ashcroft
   more harshly. A GOP-introduced bill to repeal the Patriot Act's
   "sneak and peek" authority, which allows searches without prior
   notification of the homeowner, passed in the House 309 to 118. A
   House bill to protect library and bookstore records has more than 130
   sponsors, and a Senate version is likely to be introduced shortly.
   The ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights recently filed
   lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of parts of the act, and
   the February leak of a Justice Department draft of "Patriot Act II"
   led to such widespread criticism that Ashcroft has not yet dared
   introduce the bill.

<p>The Administration has also come under increasing heat for its
   treatment of the Guant&aacute;namo detainees. The American Bar
   Association has criticized hobbling restrictions on defense lawyers
   in the upcoming military trials, and the National Association of
   Criminal Defense Lawyers has gone even further, urging its members to
   refuse to serve in the trials. In August bar leaders from England,
   Canada, Scotland, Sweden, Northern Ireland, Australia, France and
   Wales published a joint letter condemning the planned military trials
   and demanding that the detainees be tried fairly in civilian courts.

<p>Ashcroft's response? In addition to the speaking tour in which he
   will preach only to the converted, he has launched a website,
   www.lifeandliberty.gov, ostensibly designed to correct the "myths"
   surrounding the Patriot Act and to tout the Justice Department's
   "success" in the war on terrorism. But Ashcroft's defense fails to
   address most of what the public is worried about.

<p>Public concern is not limited to the Patriot Act's four corners but
   arises from a whole range of measures this Administration has
   advanced, from secret detentions to ethnic profiling to "Total
   Information Awareness" and the "enemy combatant" designations. The
   Patriot Act has become shorthand for these excesses. Ashcroft's
   defense, however, ducks virtually all this criticism, focusing only
   on a handful of the act's provisions. He doesn't mention, for
   example, its most troubling sections, those affecting immigrants.
   They allow the government to exclude foreign nationals for their
   speech, to deport them on the basis of wholly innocent associations
   with any group Ashcroft blacklists and to lock them up on his say-so,
   without showing that they are dangerous or a flight risk (the only
   two constitutionally recognized justifications for preventive
   detention). Nor does he bother to defend a provision authorizing
   freezing of assets based on secret evidence. And his website makes
   only passing reference to the act's dramatic expansion of FISA power
   to authorize search warrants in criminal investigations without
   probable cause of criminal activity.

<p>At the same time, Ashcroft's defense of the few provisions it chooses
   to address is highly misleading. In response to criticism of Section
   215, for example, which allows the government to demand access to
   library and bookstore records without probable cause, Ashcroft claims
   that this authority has always been available through grand jury
   subpoenas. But he does not say that those subpoenas are limited to
   criminal investigations and are public, while Section 215 requests
   need have no connection whatsoever to crime and are carried out
   entirely in secret. He also stresses that records requests must be
   approved by a court upon a showing that the records are related to an
   investigation concerning a foreign national and, if the investigation
   concerns a US citizen or permanent-resident alien, that the
   investigation is not based solely on First Amendment-protected
   activities. But he fails to acknowledge that these limitations apply
   only to the target of the investigation and not to those whose
   records are sought. Once the government has a legitimate
   investigation under way, the act allows it to obtain library records
   on unlimited numbers of citizens, without making any showing that
   these citizens were involved in illegal activity.

<p>Ashcroft's most questionable claim is that the Patriot Act has led to
   crucial successes in the war on terrorism. First, his linkage of the
   act to indictments he has handed down is dubious. He typically points
   to an indictment, asserts that it depended on cooperation among
   local, state and federal intelligence and law-enforcement officials,
   and then vaguely claims that the act broke down the "wall" that
   previously blocked communication between law enforcement and
   intelligence agencies. But with the exception of a single provision
   allowing prosecutors to share grand jury information with
   intelligence officials, the Patriot Act did not eliminate any legal
   "wall." As insiders have observed, the "walls" between agencies were
   cultural and bureaucratic, not legal, and the Administration did not
   need the Patriot Act to bring them down.

<p>Second, Ashcroft greatly exaggerates his "successes." He claims to
   have brought 255 criminal charges in terror investigations, but the
   vast majority of those charges were pretextual criminal charges (like
   credit card fraud or lying to an FBI agent) used to justify holding
   people who turned out to have no connection with terrorism.
   Similarly, he claims to have deported 515 people in the investigation
   but fails to mention Justice Department policy that authorized
   deportation only after the FBI cleared immigrants of involvement in
   terrorism. To call these successes is to treat bullets that miss the
   target completely as bull's-eyes.

<p>Third, and most important, Ashcroft fails to account for losses in
   liberty and privacy. If we were to repeal the Fourth Amendment, every
   police department in the country would be able to point to arrests
   that were made possible as a result. But to judge whether we lived in
   a better world for it, we'd want to know how many innocent people had
   been searched and how much the loss of privacy had undermined our
   quality of life. Ashcroft tells us only one side of the story. But
   there are by now thousands, mostly Arabs and Muslims, who could tell
   us the other side.

<p>In the end, Ashcroft's self-promotion recalls Benjamin Constant's
   account of Jacobin excesses during the French Revolution: "They
   dreamt of nothing else but measures of public safety, great measures,
   masterstrokes of state; they thought themselves extraordinary
   geniuses because justice seemed to them a narrow preoccupation. With
   each political crime they committed, you could hear them proclaiming:
   'once again we have saved the country!' Certainly we should have been
   adequately convinced by this, that a country saved every day in this
   manner must be a country that will soon be ruined."
