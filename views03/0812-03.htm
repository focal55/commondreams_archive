<p>What do you get when companies shift factories from high-income countries to

low-income countries?  The answer is capital flight.

This is today's global marketplace.  Just ask a top Wall St. economist.

<p>"For more than a decade, the vigour of Chinese export growth has come far 
more from the deliberate outsourcing strategies of western multinational 
companies than from the rapid growth of indigenous Chinese companies," wrote

Stephen Roach, the chief economist of Morgan Stanley, in the Aug. 7 
Financial Times.

<p>Currently, U.S. companies such as Du Pont, General Electric and General 
Motors are employing Chinese workers to produce a range of commodities. And 
these corporations are profiting handsomely in the process, an article in 
the same edition of the FT reported.

<p>Mr. Roach further noted this trend of capital flight to China is "a 
by-product of the struggle for competitive survival by high-cost producers 
in the industrial world."  Presumably, workers of "high-cost producers" 
enjoy weekends off, meal breaks and paid holidays, a drag on the bottom 
lines of big businesses based in the U.S.


<p>As market competition has forced employers to seek lower cost workers, 
"communist" China  has emerged as a preferred point of production.  We thus 
see capital fleeing from investors in the E.U., U.S. and Japan to China.

In turn, Chinese workers from rural areas are entering the global wage-labor

market.  Crucially, their commodity of labor-power, especially those of 
manufacturing workers, is less costly than that of U.S. workers.

<p>This trend, in turn, has helped to increase the wage gap in the American 
labor market.  "Virtually all economists recognize that the availability of 
low cost manufactured goods from developing nations has been one of the 
factors contributing to the growth in wage inequality between college and 
non-college educated workers," wrote Dean Baker, an economist with the 
Center for Economic and Policy Research.

<p>The developing nation leading the way in producing low-cost commodities for 
the global market is China.  Thus Chinese workers are super-exploited.

In this way, investors from rich nations get higher profits and more market 
share.  Otherwise, they lose one or both to business rivals.

<p>Meanwhile, the wages of manufacturing workers in America are being further 
depressed by job losses. This trend has continued during the administration 
of President George W. Bush.

<p>U.S. manufacturing employment has "declined continuously since July 2000," 
the Labor Dept. reported this July.  In that month, 71,000 manufacturing 
workers were thrown out of a job.

"Since its most recent peak in July 2000, manufacturing employment has 
fallen by more than 2.6 million," the Labor Dept. reported this June.  In 
June 2003, U.S. manufacturers cut 56,000 jobs.

<p>Think that capital flight is only affecting these American workers?  Think 
again.

<p>"And then there's the ominous trend of sending higher-skilled jobs overseas 
to low-wage places like India and China, an upscale reprise of the sweatshop

phenomenon that erased so many U.S. manufacturing jobs over the past quarter

century," wrote Bob Herbert on Aug. 7 in the New York Times.

<p>First, blue-collar workers in the U.S. lose their jobs to capital flight.  
Subsequently, the trend of job loss from firms shifting work abroad is 
reaching into the ranks of America's "upscale" white collar workers.

Perhaps this will spur a new class consciousness among those who work in 
offices and are now facing a tenuous job future.  We will see about that.

<p>Socially, what has happened as capital has fled the U.S.? The number of 
Americans locked up in jails and prisons has quadrupled since the mid-1970s.

Thus the 2,166,260 people now being held in U.S. jails and prisons (and 
invisible in Labor Dept. reports) are not on the outside earning wages.  
Significantly, the rising inmate population in which blacks are 
over-represented is partly a response to the crisis of profitability and 
weak demand for hiring workers in America's manufacturing sector.

<p>Social life (who gets by, how and why) in the U.S. during the past 25 or so 
years has been driven by the changed relations of economic and political 
power between America and other rich nations.  Americans' improved living 
standards after World War II ebbed as big businesses in Germany and Japan 
began to take market share and profits from their U.S. counterparts.

<p>The Vietnam War was a watershed time for American society in more ways than 
one.  Then, the profitability crisis (too many products for too few buyers 
on the world market) began in the manufacturing sector, as author and 
scholar Robert Brenner has written.

<p>Big business in the U.S. responded by attacking unions and New Deal/Great 
Society social spending that protected the working class from the market.  
More recently, the cutting of social spending as U.S. investment capital 
scours the globe for higher rates of return has been called "globalization."

<p>On one hand, the term can conceal more than it reveals, shedding little 
light on the part that ordinary people play in maintaining the global system

each day they go to work.  On the other hand, the sober business logic of 
capital seeking lower labor costs worldwide is hard to miss.

<p>Capital flight to China a case in point.  The goods made by Chinese workers 
now on the shelves of your local Wal-Mart are proof of that.

Based on U.S. government estimates, Wal-Mart
"sourced about $10 billion worth of goods from China last year," the Aug. 7 
Financial Times reported.  On a related note, the same retailer is the 
biggest private firm in America, paying its nearly 750,000 female employees 
working as "sales associates" $6.10 an hour, on average, according to the 
National Organization for Women.

<p>Meanwhile, the needs of capital to expand are equated with  decision-making 
processes in the rich nations.  As Mr. Roach wrote, "A high-cost industrial 
world has made a decision that it needs China-based outsourcing to ensure 
competitive survival."

<p>Well, has capital flight to China flowed from a popular mandate led by the 
American people?  Were there elections across America supporting the flight 
of U.S. capital to China?

<p>I don't remember them.  Do you?

<p>What do we think about globalization? And how does globalization make us 
think?
