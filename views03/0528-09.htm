<p>We don't know, says the Bush administration.

<p>And we don't care, says the public.

<p>That seems to sum up the matter of weapons of mass destruction in
   Iraq. The Bush crew still hasn't uncovered evidence that its prewar
   pronouncements about WMD were on (or close to) the mark. Nor has it
   been able to explain why the Pentagon did not move expeditiously
   during and after the war to secure suspected WMD sites, particularly
   nuclear facilities that were known to hold large quantities of
   radioactive material that could be of value to anyone seeking to
   build a nuclear or dirty bomb.

<p>The Pentagon did announce it had found several tractor trailers that
   it concluded were mobile biological weapons labs. But not a spot of
   biological agent had been found on them. Two former UN weapons
   inspectors--David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and
   International Security, and a scientist who asked not to be
   identified--told me that even if these trailers had been thoroughly
   scrubbed, there should be trace residues that would indicate what was
   done in them. Moreover, these trailers--as threatening as they might
   have been--were hardly the bulk of Bush's case against Iraq.

<p>Still, Bush has not had to answer the tough questions regarding WMD.
   Such as, where are they? No wonder: last week, The Washington Post
   published a front-page story--"No Political Fallout for Bush on
   Weapons"--that reported polls showed Americans "unconcerned about
   weapons discoveries." If the public doesn't care, it's not likely
   Republicans will be rushing to hold congressional hearings to grill
   Bush aides on this subject. The war, the Post noted, was supported by
   over 70 percent of the public.

<p>But the postwar may be a different matter. Last week, Democratic and
   Republican senators began criticizing the Bush administration's
   handling of postwar Iraq. At a hearing of the Senate Foreign
   Relations Committee, Senator Joseph Biden, the ranking Democratic,
   whacked Paul Wolfowitz, asking the deputy defense secretary, "When is
   the president going to tell the American people that we're likely to
   be in the country of Iraq for three, four, five, six, eight, ten
   years, with thousands of forces and spending billions of dollars?
   Because its' not been told to them yet." (Biden supported the war.)
   Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican, noted, "We may have underestimated
   or mischaracterized the challenges of establishing security and
   rebuilding Iraq." Senator Richard Lugar, who chairs the committee,
   remarked, "I am concerned that the administration's initial
   stabilization and reconstruction efforts have been inadequate." In a
   Washington Post op-ed, Lugar gently jabbed at Bush: "Clearly, the
   administration's planning for the post-conflict phase in Iraq was
   inadequate." He estimated the US occupation will last at least five
   years and observed that the final tab may hit $100 billion.

<p>No one in the Senate yet is throwing bricks at a White House occupied
   by a popular president. But the screw-ups in postwar Iraq are
   becoming an unavoidable topic for legislators. The senior Democrats
   and Republicans on both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
   the House International relations Committee have requested that the
   General Accounting Office examine the entire US occupation in Iraq:
   the security efforts, the relief programs, the awarding of contracts,
   the economic plan, and the political rebuilding. This request was a
   sign that senators and representatives in both parties have become
   frustrated with the slow flow of information from the Bush
   administration on its postwar endeavors. (The Bushies not sharing?
   What a surprise.)

<p>The turmoil in Iraq has also prompted Democratic presidential
   candidates--including those who supported the war--to swing harder at
   Bush. Writing for The Boston Globe, Senator Joseph Lieberman, who
   twice in the op-ed identified himself as an advocate of the war,
   griped, "In Iraq, shock and awe is giving way to stumble and fumble.
   Weeks after a brilliant military victory, the Bush administration is
   failing to secure the peace." He also complained that "many of the
   most sensitive facilities in Iraq--sites we believed to house weapons
   of mass destruction--were left unprotected and were looted after the
   fighting ended." He might have been stretching things. It is clear
   that nuclear materials were grabbed by parties unknown, but there is
   no public indication that actual WMDs were in Iraq and snatched.

<p>Senator John Edwards has blasted Bush's postwar policy as "confused
   and chaotic," urging the White House to further involve the United
   Nations and NATO in reconstituting Iraq. "Most disturbing," he
   commented, "nuclear, chemical and biological facilities have been
   left unprotected and have been ransacked--not only destroying
   possible evidence about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, but
   presenting a real threat such materials will end up in the hands of
   terrorists." Senator John Kerry, who raised questions about the war
   but ultimately backed it, took a different tack. He wrote to Bush
   requesting that he "instruct the Secretary of Treasury to identify
   Saudi Arabia as a primary money laundering concern [for terrorists]
   under the authority provided" in the USA PATRIOT act. In doing so,
   Kerry was implicitly criticizing the commander-in-chief of not doing
   all he could to neutralize the evildoers. (Is the Saudi connection an
   Achilles' heel for Bush? The Bush clan--including former President
   Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker--have long had
   business dealings in Saudi Arabia, and one cannot do business there
   without cozying up to the autocrats. So how tough can Bush get with
   the Saudis?)

<p>Interviewed on CNN, Representative Dick Gephardt, another Democratic
   fan of the war, defended Bush's prewar assertions about WMD. "We're
   going to get to the bottom of this," he said. "It's going to take
   time." Gephardt did remark that he wished "the president would talk
   more about the various reasons that terrorism is upon us and what we
   need to do....He keep saying we're going to get 'em. We all want to
   get 'em, but there are a lot of other things we need to do to prevent
   them from doing acts of terrorism." This was a milder rebuke those
   hurled by his 2004 competitors.

<p>The two main war-critics in the race for the Democratic nomination
   have issued postwar reproaches in keeping with their different
   styles. Representative Dennis Kucinich hit the House floor and asked,
   in a raised voice, "Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
   Indeed, what was the basis for the war? We spend $400 billion for
   defense. Will we spend a minute to defend the truth? The truth is
   this administration led America into a war with such great urgency.
   Yet, it is still refusing to account to the American people for its
   false and misleading statements." And former Vermont Governor Howard
   Dean has argued that the jury's still out on the war because a
   possible outcome might be an Islamic fundamentalist state in Iraq.
   After the fall of Baghdad, Dean said of Saddam Hussein, "We got rid
   of him. I suppose that's a good thing." He took plenty of flak for
   that suppose. But he has stuck to his stance that war was a
   "diversion," noting "we're not safer today than we were before Saddam
   Hussein left." He has not, though, made a big issue of the postwar
   trauma. A hunch: after kick-starting his campaign as a foe of the
   war, he may well be attempting to move on by pushing other aspects of
   his candidacy, such as his pitch for expanded healthcare coverage.

<p>The complaints about Bush's handling of postwar Iraq have hardly
   reached a crescendo within the Democratic Party or beyond. But there
   are stirrings. The Shi'ites aren't the only ones restive. Democratic
   presidential candidates are eager to find national security-related
   ground upon which they can challenge Bush the Conqueror and
   Protector. And independent-minded Republicans have started fretting
   about what's to come in Iraq.

<p>The primary reason the United States invaded and occupied
   Iraq--WMD--may already be old news. But the costly mess in Iraq isn't
   going away anytime soon. Perhaps there will be more of a debate on
   the postwar than the war itself.
