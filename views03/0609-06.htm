<p>We all grew up learning that tyrannical or totalitarian governments were the cause of much suffering. Today's world is showing us something else as well: The greatest human misery can happen where there is no functioning government at all. The most tragic example is the multisided civil war in the misnamed Democratic Republic of Congo. 

<p>News from the Congo's Ituri region in recent weeks has been so grim as to make one want to turn the page or flip the TV channel in despair: tens of thousands of refugees in flight, ethnic-based mass murder, killers jubilantly draping themselves in the entrails of their victims, rival militias using child soldiers - 10- and 11-year-old boys bearing AK-47s and hand grenades. Such horrors are but the latest in a civil war whose death toll, in less than five years, is estimated by the International Rescue Committee at 3.3 million at least. This is the greatest such bloodshed anywhere on Earth since the end of World War II and there is no end in sight. 

<p>The conflict's origins are many. A hundred years ago, under King Leopold II of Belgium, the Congo was the scene of the most brutal part of the European colonization of Africa. The king's private colony - and, to a lesser extent, the early years of the Belgian Congo that succeeded it - was based on a draconian system of forced labor that, over a 40-year period, slashed the territory's population roughly in half, an estimated drop of about 10 million people. 

<p>But the heritage of colonialism can't be blamed for everything. The formation of a modern nation state is a slow, complicated business, which in most of Western Europe was accompanied by war and violence and took several centuries. To survive in the modern world, Africa doesn't have those centuries to spend. 

<p>One trigger for the Congo's war came in 1994, when the world did nothing to stop the Rwanda genocide. When the Hutu regime that carried out those killings was overthrown, its leaders and nearly a million other Hutus fled to the Congo. 

<p>Angry at continuing attacks mounted from there by an extremist Hutu core, the army of the new government in Rwanda eventually occupied part of northeastern Congo. 

<p>Seeing a huge, mineral-rich country whose sclerotic, corrupt, U.S.-backed Mobutu regime collapsed in 1997, other nearby African nations soon joined in dividing the spoils. At various points, the armies of seven of them have had troops on Congo's soil. They formed an ever-changing web of alliances with local rebel groups, and with the many foreign corporations (American, South African, European) eager to buy the Congo's diamonds, gold, timber, copper, cobalt and columbium-tantalum, or coltan. Coltan, which has at times has rivaled gold in price per ounce, is used in chips in cell phones and computers; 

the eastern Congo has more than half the world's supply. 

<p>This vast wealth in the ground and the lack of a functioning central government have been a catastrophic combination. When there is no money in the public treasury, armies become self-financing networks of miners and smugglers. 

<p>When there are few schools, they can easily recruit children. When there are few jobs, control of precious minerals becomes the source of all money. 

<p>So, what is to be done? Peace won't come easily to the Congo, but three things would help: 

<p>International intervention: The minuscule and hamstrung United Nations peacekeeping force now there should be dramatically expanded, its mandate toughened and its length of service seen as a matter of years. 

<p>After Iraq, of course, we all need to be suspicious of any high-sounding justifications for military intervention and to remember that even multinational "humanitarian interventions" are usually done for non- humanitarian motives. The United States and Europe would probably never have sent troops to Kosovo if there had not been a danger of a million Kosovar refugees flooding into nearby NATO countries - yet that intervention saved tens of thousands of lives. The number saved could be much greater in Congo. 

<p>The Congo's vast bloodshed does not threaten to spill over into the United States and Europe, so can we expect Americans and Europeans to risk the lives of their soldiers? Washington has already said no. Canada, several European nations and a few countries elsewhere have said yes - but only on a very small scale. That scale needs to expand drastically, and Washington - at the very least - needs to be shamed into helping to pay for it. If there is no meaningful intervention, the United Nations will be shown to be helpless and hollow. This may be what President Bush wants, but most people on Earth have higher hopes. 

<p>Policing the entire Congo - a land mass considerably bigger than Alaska but without a network of working roads or rail - is too much to hope for. But a U. N. force at least several times the size of the 10,800-soldier contingent now under discussion could begin to halt the terrible bloodshed in the northeastern corner of the country, where most carnage has taken place. 

<p>Outlaw 'conflict minerals': Anarchic civil wars like those in the Congo are fueled by lucrative minerals. Recognizing how diamonds have helped drive the conflicts in Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, more than 50 nations recently agreed to cease trading in "conflict diamonds." Remarkably, given its scorn for most international agreements, the signers included the United States. It remains to be seen how much the agreement will be enforced. But, a recent World Bank study suggested, if conflict diamonds can be outlawed, why not "conflict gold" and "conflict coltan"? If followed, such pacts could slash the funding for the warlords who have ravaged so much of the Congo. 

<p>Stop selling arms to Africa: Finally, we must stop arming Africa. The United States and France have been the worst offenders here. Just during the 1990s, the United States alone gave more than $200 million worth of equipment and military training to African armies, including six of the seven that have had troops involved in Congo's civil war. 

<p>This is the modern version of what happened hundreds of years ago, when American and European ship captains used muskets and ammunition as one of the currencies for purchasing slaves from African dealers. This senseless, destructive flow of arms into the continent fueled a brutal commerce in human beings then, and it fuels a brutal commerce in conflict minerals today. It's time to call a halt.
