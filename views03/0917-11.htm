<p>The recent collapse of the World Trade Organization negotiations in Cancun 
represents a victory for democracy, civil society, and the unity of 
developing nations.  The crumbling of the WTO meeting highlights the growing 
resistance from people who have been adversely affected by trade 
liberalization and free trade agreements.  But what really happened in 
Cancun and why did the talks collapse?

<p>We had heard about the notorious “green rooms”, off limits to all but the 
very influential, where delegations of experts from the United States (US) 
and European Union (EU) would pressure trade ministers from developing 
countries.  Often alone and without counsel, trade ministers from poor 
countries would be coerced to sign onto the latest round of trade rules in 
secret “informal meetings” for which no minutes would be kept.

<p>Yet it was still appalling to hear that on the last day of the WTO 
conference, Ministers from eight countries of the Global South (Kenya, 
Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, China and India), had been called at 
1:00 am for two hours of negotiations with the US and EU.

<p>Additionally, there are no participatory procedures for drafting and 
revising WTO texts.  Many WTO Ministers and the general public do not know 
how the drafts of the Declarations are made and very little time is given to 
the delegations to review and act on them.  The initial Draft Text was made 
available only two weeks before the negotiations began. The views of many or 
most of the developing countries were ignored in the revised texts.

<p>During five days of negotiations Ministers from 148 countries met to discuss 
new ways of enhancing trade for thousands of things ranging from corn to 
cotton to medicines to water.  One of the most important issues in the 
"green rooms" was agriculture.  The US and EU wanted all countries to lower 
tariffs, thereby promoting free trade.

<p>The part of the “free trade” debate that the US and EU would not discuss was 
their insistence on continued agricultural subsidies for their markets 
amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per year.  Approximately 80% of 
American farm subsidies go to large agribusiness allowing them to flood the 
world market with cheap agricultural goods (a.k.a. dumping). In short, the 
US and EU represent the interests of large corporations.

<p>To put the enormity of these subsidies in perspective, an American cow 
receives $2.90 a day in subsidies and a European cow $2.20 per day while 1/2 
of the people in the world survive on less than $2.00 per day. Due to 
taxpayer funded subsidies American and European cows are financially better 
off than the majority of people in the world.

<p>During the week of trade negotiations over 6000 campesinos (farmers) from 
all over the world held a separate shadow conference in Cancun to discuss 
the effects of trade liberalization on their lives and to inform the trade 
Ministers that the current system was not sustainable.

<p>On the first day of the conference the campesinos organized a march from 
downtown to the conference center, which was strategically situated 8 km 
away from the city on a road, which was barricaded with a twenty-foot fence.

<p>Included was a group of 200 South Korean farmers led by Mr. Kyung Hae Lee, 
President of the Korean Farmers Organization.  Mr. Lee had dedicated his 
life to analyzing the effects of free trade and organizing farmers.  Upon 
arriving at the barricade Mr. Lee climbed the wall and took his life as an 
act of solidarity with millions of small farmers who have been harmed by 
trade liberalization.

<p>"Don't worry about me, just struggle your hardest," Mr. Lee shouted as he 
took his own life.

<p>Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) began in 1994 the rate 
of small farmer bankruptcies in the US and Canada has risen five fold and 
millions of Mexican farmers have been forced off their land.  With the help 
of NAFTA and the WTO, big agribusiness has taken over.

<p>A coalition of developing countries called the G-22, recognizing the 
destructive effects of the subsidies, resisted US and EU demands and walked 
out of the talks.

<p>“For the first time in the WTO, the developing world united not on 
ideological grounds but on key and well articulated interests and acted in 
concert to advance its developmental agenda,” said South Africa’s minister 
for trade and industry, Alec Erwin.

<p>It seems that the developing countries have now figured out that the WTO’s 
current playing field is not level and the trade is neither free nor fair.

<p>The collapse of the talks is a victory for developing nations; however the 
US may use this as an opportunity to pull away from the WTO and use its 
bullying tactics on countries individually to pursue bilateral trade 
agreements.  The US would like to do this throughout Latin America with the 
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).

<p>The US has already used open threats to continue to bully developing 
countries such as the one by Chuck Grassley, Chair of the U.S. Senate 
Finance Committee, who said he would judge other countries seeking bilateral 
trade deals by their behavior in Cancun.

<p>Whether it’s through the WTO or new forms of bilateral trade agreements, the 
economic principles that govern our new world should be based upon the 
promotion of human rights and democratic principles, not on corporate 
profits.  Unfair trade agreements must be resisted and reformed into an 
economic system of trade that benefits the many, not the few.
