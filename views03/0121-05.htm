<p>He's been demonizing Saddam Hussein for a year, but U.S. President George Bush still hasn't managed to sell most Americans on his Iraq policy, much less the rest of the world.<P></P>While six in 10 Americans are prepared to attack Iraq, fully half want a United Nations mandate first, and that's going to be hard to obtain. Barely three in 10 would go it alone. This is no great show of support for the commander-in-chief.<P></P>It helps explain why 200,000 or more peace activists thronged Washington on Saturday in a protest reminiscent of Vietnam War days. <P></P>Here in Canada, where Prime Minister Jean Chrétien rightly prefers the multilateral U.N. route, 10,000 brave souls faced down the arctic cold Saturday to march in Toronto, as did 20,000 in Montreal and thousands more in other cities. Six in 10 now oppose an attack without U.N. approval, a new poll suggests. Not one in six endorses a unilateral assault. In Britain, sentiment runs much the same.<P></P>Despite a huge military buildup, Bush has failed to put forward a compelling case for attacking Iraq, a full year after making his "axis of evil" speech. That's remarkable, given America's tendency to rally to the president in war, the 9/11 effect, the power of the presidential bully pulpit, the reach of U.S. intelligence services, and a largely compliant American media.<P></P>While the U.S. still has reason to <i>contain</i> Saddam, Bush's approach looks more like bullying and less like prudence with every passing day.<P></P>The push is now on to frighten Saddam into exile, or to spark a palace revolt. Should that fail, Bush wants the Security Council to begin consideration of war as soon as chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix delivers his verdict Monday on Iraq's cooperation after 400 inspections.<P></P>U.S. officials contend Saddam is not "co-operating" sufficiently. But what of the news yesterday that he is? Blix reported that Iraq has given inspectors access to "all sites." That Iraq has been "helpful" setting up inspection offices. That Iraq has begun to produce some weapons. That Iraq is providing documents that the U.N. needs. That Iraq promises to answer queries about its 12,000-page weapons declaration. And that the U.N. will get to interrogate scientists in private.<P></P>Is this enough? No. Bush rightly points out Saddam has yet to account for some nuclear know-how and some biological and chemical weapons.<P></P>Yesterday Blix agreed, and called for more ``proactive" co-operation. There's been "positive co-operation," he said. But "proactive would require very active effort on their part to bring forward evidence, documents, interviews.'' At the same time, he argues inspections must continue for many months more, as an alternative to war.<P></P>A majority of permanent Security Council members — the Chinese, Russians and French — agree.<P></P>They believe sanctions have blunted Saddam's threat. They think Bush is overly dismissive of Iraq's co-operation so far. They argue the renewed U.N. inspections make it hard for Saddam to cheat, and the inspectors need more time. They see no need to rush into war. It's hard to disagree, as long as Saddam co-operates, and no "smoking gun" emerges.<P></P>The need to attack Iraq is far from evident. The timing is wrong. The human cost could be tragically high.</i></p>
