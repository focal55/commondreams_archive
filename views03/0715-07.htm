<p>The day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that sodomy was OK after all, The News-Journal received a one-line letter from a reader upset at the way the paper headlined the ruling: "I hope," the reader wrote, "your child or children all ask you what Sodomy is when they see your front page today." The word did appear in a point size big enough to make the Gomorrah Chamber of Commerce jealous. But the ruling wasn't about lollipops. And euphemisms about sex have a Jane Austen dullness to them that would, if used in a 21st century newspaper, send our readers lunging for Geraldo. Had my 9-year-old daughter asked (disappointingly, she didn't), I'd have answered no differently than if she'd asked why lovers French-kiss in public or why New Yorkers cuss like Corsicans: It's what people do, and who are we to demand otherwise?
<p>With homosexuals, we demand that they act otherwise all the time. Treating gays like lepers is the last full-throttle prejudice. It's not acceptable in polite company to call blacks niggers (at least not since Strom Thurmond died), to make jokes at the expense of most ethnic groups (the French excluded), even to catcall. It's still done, but it usually raises eyebrows or echoes with face-saving disclaimers.

<p>No disclaimer necessary with gays. Bash them all you want. To do so is a sign of virility -- physical and moral, by the way. The only raised eyebrows are directed at those who would insist that something is amiss when the land of liberty turns Sodom and Gomorrah on gays the moment they want to serve in the military, get married, teach school, be Boy Scouts or Father Confessors. That last raises a thorny issue in light of the Catholic Church's proclivity for pedophile priests. But it's the Catholic Church that has given gays a bad name, not the other way around, as its cover-up of a problem that has everything to do with sexual predators fed into myths that have absolutely nothing to do with gays.

<p>The heart and soul of the prejudice against gays -- the money shot that gives it its Good Housekeeping seal of approval and its solidarity-rich membership across races, religions, police precincts and sports fans everywhere -- is the knee-jerk equivalence of gays as pedophiles and recruiters for the "lifestyle," a word purposefully made to sound like a limp wrist in the given context. The Spanish Inquisition used the same logic of association when it blamed infidels for earthquakes (and incinerated them), or when, a few centuries earlier, good, clean, fun Europeans blamed Jews for the plague (and incinerated them).

<p>Grand inquisitors never die. They just wear different robes. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a devout Catholic, gave voice in his dissent from the sodomy decision to a common fear that the ruling would open the door to legalized "bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity," as if most of these pleasures were anything to worry the state about. What little remains of the liberal press gave Scalia a beating. But going after him allowed liberals to ignore the intolerance among their own. One Democratic presidential contender after another, including the alleged ultraliberal Howard Dean, has gone Scalia Lite on the ultimate gay right: Yes to "equal rights" under the law, no to gay marriage. It is sexuality's separate-but-equal doctrine, no less demeaning to gays than Plessy vs. Ferguson was to blacks. And just as racists for four centuries pointed to the Bible as their justification for treating blacks like animals, so homophobes today cite "Judeo-Christian tradition" as blessing their contempt for gays. Repugnant attitudes generally fail to meet more rational standards, although some people try.

<p>A favorite formula goes like this: "I have nothing against gay people as long as they don't throw their lifestyle in my face." Aside from pointing to the closet, the formula is a jewel of right-thinking bigotry. It assumes that being gay is an act. It degrades tolerance to whatever is acceptable to majority rule, which makes sludge of free choice. And it assumes that gays brandish their sexuality in ways heterosexuals don't, which is the greatest heterosexual crock since Liberace. In advertising, in movies, in schoolbook narratives, in every conceivable social and political assumption, the country is pathologically heterosexual, brandishing the point like an adolescent high on hormones -- and throwing it in everybody's face, children included. Compared to that, two guys smooching on a street corner is modesty incarnate.

<p>The family values set would consider that disgusting, of course. That's the set giving us a run at a constitutional amendment that would define marriage exclusively as a union between a man and a woman, thus bringing back in law the moldy notion that marriage begins with rules, and rules defined from above, no less. Senators led by Majority Leader Bill Frist want the proposed amendment on the agenda. It may become the 2004 election's sexiest issue. From dark age superstitions to leaps of idiocy, we'll have in-your-face homophobia as national political sport, because neighborhood gay-bashing just wasn't enough.





<p>And you thought the Taliban was just an Afghan thing.
