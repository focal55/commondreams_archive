<p>Will there be an investigation into whether Bush administration 
officials violated the law and undermined national security in 
order to mount a political vendetta? It's up to the CIA and the 
Justice Department. Cynics, start your engines.</p>
<p>
As first noted <a 
href="http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?b
id=3&pid=823" target="_new">here</a> (and further explored <a 
href="http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=
845" target="_new">here</a>), several weeks ago, Bush officials lashed out at 
former Ambassador Joseph Wilson by telling journalists--including 
conservative columnist Robert Novak--that Wilson's wife was a 
deep-cover CIA operative working in the field of weapons 
counterproliferation. Novak and others reported what they were 
heard from these administration sources. Their stories either blew 
her cover or falsely branded a woman, who is known to friends as 
an energy analyst in a private firm, as a CIA officer. Wilson will 
not say whether his wife is a spy. But the prevailing assumption 
among journalists covering this controversy is that she is (or 
was) a CIA operative. After all, administration officials keep 
repeating this claim. And in case you forgot, Wilson's sin (in the 
eyes of the vengeful Bushies) was that he went public about a trip 
he took to Niger in February 2002--at the request of the 
CIA--during which he investigated the allegation that Iraq was 
shopping for uranium there. He concluded that the charge was 
"highly doubtful." His account undercut White House claims that 
it 
had no reason to suspect President Bush was not speaking 
accurately when he included this dubious allegation in his case 
for war during his 2003 State of the Union address.</p>
<p>
If Wilson's wife is an Agency op specializing in counter-WMD work, 
then it is possible that Bush officials damaged the intelligence 
establishment's effort to thwart the spread of weapons of mass 
destruction <i> and</i> broke the law. Under the Intelligence 
Identities Protection Act of 1982, it is a crime for anyone with 
access to classified information to reveal intentionally the 
identity of an undercover intelligence officer. The punishment: a 
fine up to $50,000 and/or up to ten years in jail. (Journalists 
are generally not covered by the law.) 
</p>
<p>
So if a crime of this sort has been committed, where's the 
investigation? In a July 24 letter to FBI director Robert Mueller, 
Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, requested that the 
FBI "immediately launch an investigation to determine the source 
of this [leaked] information and assess whether there is enough 
evidence to refer the matter for criminal prosecution." In a 
statement, Schumer noted that investigations into such leaks are 
not unusual. In June 2002, the FBI investigated the allegation 
that someone had leaked classified congressional testimony 
provided by Lt. General Michael Hayden, the head of the National 
Security Agency. The Bureau, according to Schumer, questioned 37 
members of the House and Senate intelligence committees and about 
60 staffmembers. Vice President Dick Cheney had been one of the 
instigators of that inquiry. "The current scandal," Schumer says, 
"is just as serious as the one from June 2002." He adds, "This is 
one of the most reckless and nasty things I've seen in all my 
years of government. Leaking the name of a CIA agent is tantamount 
to putting a gun to that agent's head. It compromises her safety 
and the safety of her loved ones, not to mention those in her 
network and other operatives she may have dealt with. On top of 
that, the officials who have done it may have also seriously 
jeopardized the national security of this nation." (Without 
knowing exactly what Wilson's wife did for the CIA, it is not 
possible to judge fully the consequences of this leak. But 
Schumer's melodramatic appraisal could well be justified.)
</p>
<p>
Is the FBI hot on the trail? Not exactly, not yet. And that's 
partly because the CIA gets to say whether there is a full-fledged 
criminal inquiry. In other words, the CIA will determine if the 
Justice Department and the FBI investigate Bush administration 
officials. According to several government sources familiar with 
leaks investigations, this is how it usually works: if the CIA 
learns of an authorized disclosure of classified information and 
wants to see the case pursued, it refers the allegation to the 
Justice Department. The DOJ then evaluates the legal issues and 
decides whether to have the FBI investigate. After Schumer made 
his formal request to Mueller, the FBI kicked the matter over to 
the CIA, according to a government source monitoring the case. 
Does the CIA want an investigation? Mark Mansfield, a spokesman 
for the CIA, declined to comment. And what about the congressional 
intelligence committees? A Senate intelligence committee source 
says that committee members have made inquiries but that nothing 
major is likely to happen until the CIA informs the Justice 
Department that it suspects the law was broken.
</p>
<p>
By now, you see the potential problem. For an investigation to 
proceed, it appears, the CIA--and that probably means CIA chief 
George Tenet--has to ask for one, and Attorney General John 
Ashcroft (or an underling) has to greenlight it. Will either of 
these two Bush allies be willing to take on the White House and 
trigger an inquiry that could embarrass, if not threaten, the Bush 
administration? The relationship between the CIA and the White 
House has already been strained recently. War hawks in the 
administration--including Cheney--reportedly leaned on the CIA 
before the invasion of Iraq to produce intelligence to back up 
their claims that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass 
destruction and was in cahoots with al Qaeda. Unidentified CIA 
officials fought back by telling reporters that the White House 
was trying to pressure the CIA and rig the intelligence. 
</p>
<p>
During the Nigergate scandal, the CIA contradicted explanations 
offered by the White House, which at one point tried to pin the 
blame for this screw-up entirely on the CIA. And a new--and 
slim--book by Laurie Mylroie, a neoconservative scholar associated 
with the American Enterprise Institute, accuses the CIA of 
actually trying to thwart Bush's war on terrorism. Mylroie's 
book--endorsed by Pentagon adviser Richard Perle--may well reflect 
the suspicion with which some neocons in (and close to) the Bush 
administration view the CIA.</p>
<p>
Amid all this, would Tenet want to get into a new pissing match 
with the White House and place Bush officials in the crosshairs? 
That would be the bureaucratic equivalent of declaring nuclear 
war. And despite the tensions of late between the White House and 
the CIA on Iraq-related issues, Tenet certainly owes Bush. After 
9/11--which was, in part, an intelligence failure--Bush 
enthusiastically defended Tenet's CIA and embraced the director. 
There was no talk from the White House of replacing him. (It 
probably didn't hurt that Tenet, a savvy Washington survivor, had 
named CIA headquarters after Bush's father, who spent one year as 
CIA director in the 1970s.)</p>
<p>
Will Tenet dare ask Ashcroft to unleash the FBI's gumshoes upon 
the White House? Would Ashcroft and the FBI mount an unfettered, 
let-the-chips-fall inquiry? And if either the CIA or the Justice 
Department declines to pursue this issue, can the public be 
confident that the decision was based on legitimate--not 
political--grounds? 
</p>
<p>
No official--as far as I can tell--has yet publicly broached the 
possibility of a special counsel. The independent counsel law no 
longer exists. But the Bush administration could still on its own 
appoint a special counsel to examine the Wilson leak. The Bush 
White House, though, has shown little interest in determining if 
vindictive administration officials did disclose classified 
information to harm Wilson and his family. Once summer is over and 
Congress returns to Washington, several Democratic 
legislators--including Schumer--are expected to ask if an 
appropriate investigation is under way. If one is not, they might 
have no recourse other than to call for a special counsel. 
</p>
<p>
The leak about Wilson's wife was an ugly act. Wilson is convinced 
it was arranged by the White House to intimidate others who might 
consider disclosing information troubling for the administration. 
If Bush officials did purposefully destroy the cover of a 
government employee combating WMD proliferation in order to punish 
Wilson, certainly an accounting is deserved and punishment 
warranted. But is Tenet in any position to sic the FBI on the 
White House, upon which he depends for his budget and his own job? 
Can FBI officials who answer to Ashcroft be sure their careers 
will not be impaired should they vigorously investigate Bush 
officials? Perils abound for the spooks and law enforcement 
officers who chase this case. After all, the suspects are people 
who went after a man's family. 
</p>
<p>
The public may not learn--officially--whether the CIA requests an 
investigation. The CIA has good reason to keep its decision under 
wraps. If the CIA or the Justice Department were to announce that 
the Agency had asked for an investigation, it would be public 
confirmation that Wilson's wife was (and may still be) a CIA 
officer. Members of Congress and officials at the CIA and the FBI, 
though, will be in a position to know if an inquiry goes forward. 
And news of an investigation--or the lack thereof--will likely 
slip out. In the meantime, the few Senate and House members who 
have expressed outrage over the Wilson leak ought to start 
considering the next step. The only way to assure that there is an 
honest investigation devoid of bureaucratic intrigues could well 
be to turn to a special counsel and free Tenet and Ashcroft from 
deciding whether the Bush White House ought to be probed for a 
dirty deed that might have threatened national security.
