<p>George W. Bush has brought the world to the brink of one war and plunged it into another: the war that he is hell-bent on unleashing on Iraq, and the other on the diplomatic front, where he has torpedoed the Atlantic alliance, undermined moderate Muslim allies and is about to sink the system of international law that has helped govern the world since World War II.<P></P>For this, we can blame Saddam Hussein, of course, but also America — more precisely, the Bush administration. Its unmatched arrogance, staggering dishonesty and extraordinary incompetence at international relations have set the stage for the coming week's showdown, not between enemies but friends.<P></P>France, Russia and China are threatening to use their Security Council veto against an Anglo-American resolution indirectly authorizing war. They had been hoping Bush would back off to avert a crisis. He gave his answer Thursday night: Go ahead, make my day! <P></P>In forcing the vote, the president must hope the veto-bearing dissenters will blink, abstain and let America have its way.<P></P>If they don't, he will be aiming for nine votes out of 15 and — notwithstanding the veto(es) — claim a dubious "mandate of the majority" to invade Iraq.<P></P><b> </b>No leader, let alone an American president, should have boxed himself like this — arguing first that there was no need for U.N. authorization, then asking for one and, being denied one, barrelling ahead unilaterally, partly because he has 250,000 impatient troops on standby halfway around the world raring to go.<P></P>A similar clumsiness has marked the administration's constantly shifting case for invading Iraq, by hook or crook.<P></P>First, it was about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. Then, about the gullibility of the United Nations inspectors to his machinations. <P></P>But with the inspectors swatting away many baseless American charges, and successfully beginning to destroy banned missiles, it is no longer about those weapons per se. Now, it is about the American read of Saddam's "intent" on getting rid of them.<P></P>Off and on, it has also been about getting Saddam, dead or alive — or perhaps not. He can stay if he disarms. No, he can't. He should be exiled.<P></P>Lately, it has also been about Saddam's links to Al Qaeda — a thoroughly discredited allegation pursued nonetheless in a shameless exploitation of the American people's understandable post-Sept. 11 fears.<P></P>Since last week, the Bush mission has also been about establishing democracy in Iraq and liberating Iraqis from Saddam's tyranny — the strongest moral point in the American arsenal but totally ineffective in light of its own past patronage of the tyrant, its callous discounting of Iraqi suffering under economic sanctions and the fact that its bombs will kill many Iraqis before freeing them.<P></P>
American disdain for international law is also on display in the stepped-up bombing of Iraqi defenses in and around the north and south no-fly zones.
<P></P> The zones were created for the protection of Shiites and Kurds from Saddam, not for warfare against him. The Anglo-American bombing there since December, 1998, has itself been questionable — in that it had no specific U.N. mandate. Lately, the bombers have been taking out surface-to-surface missiles and rockets that might reach American troops in neighboring Kuwait.
<P></P>So, the war has begun before it has begun.<P></P>Anyone questioning any of this is deemed an appeaser of a new Hitler. Never mind that the analogy is utterly false: The Fuehrer was marching across Europe as Neville Chamberlain twiddled, while Saddam is surrounded.<P></P> Critics are routinely called anti-American. They are insulted and have their integrity and motives questioned. The millions of anti-war marchers are foolish. France is an aging beauty unaware of its wrinkles. Turkey is a bazaar where the haggling never ends. Chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix is a retiree who does not want to return to Sweden as the man who caused a war.<P></P>Meanwhile, the simplest and the most profound questions remain unanswered: Why war now, especially when it lacks international legitimacy, both in law and in the court of world public opinion? Why abandon the inspections precisely when they are beginning to work? Why risk the entire U.N. system? Why risk geopolitical upheaval? More importantly, why risk inflicting a humanitarian catastrophe on an already crushed people?<P></P>><i>Haroon Siddiqui is the Star's editorial page editor emeritus.
