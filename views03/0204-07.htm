<p>Greetings, members of the United
Nations.  <p>I am writing on the eve of Secretary of State
Colin Powell’s February 5 presentation on Saddam Hussein and
Iraq’s alleged links to al Qaeda and its possession of
and/or ongoing attempts to develop banned weapons of mass
destruction.  Many of you will read this after February 5,
and that’s fine.  You will be debating and discussing the
import and details of Powell’s presentation in the days and
weeks that follow, and you will be aided immeasurably by a
fuller understanding of the man and his standards.<p>Judging
from the following excerpt of an article in Sunday’s
Washington Post (<small><a href=
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12652-2003Feb1.html target="_new">
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12652-2003Feb1.html</a></small>),
European diplomats in particular have far too rosy a view of
Powell’s character and credibility: <p>“Any hope of an
agreement, a European diplomat said, rests with Powell. He
is widely trusted by council governments, and many said his
words this week will have a heavy impact.  ‘You are lucky to
have a representative for this administration that is as
credible as he is,’ the European diplomat said. ‘If you
didn’t have him, you’d really have much, much greater
difficulties working with a whole lot of
Europeans.’”<p>Secretary Powell is a brilliant man, but I
ask that you leave open the question of trust and
credibility.  For starters, you might ask Hans Blix to
expound on this portion of a recent New York Times article: 
“Mr. Blix took issue with what he said were Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell's claims that the inspectors had found
that Iraqi officials were hiding and moving illicit
materials within and outside of Iraq to prevent their
discovery. He said that the inspectors had reported no such
incidents” (<small><a href=
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/international/middleeast/31BLIX.html target="_new">
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/international/middleeast/31BLIX.html</a></small>).<p>If
Blix is correct, this suggests that Powell is willing to
deceive on matters that are easily checked.  What would such
a man be capable of when presenting “evidence” that is not
subject to verification?  <p>Although our immediate focus is
Iraq, I include below a <a href=#postscript> postscript</a>
that offers evidence and citations from reputable human
rights groups of Powell’s “fictitious” certifications to
Congress on aid to Colombia, as well as his devotion in the
1980s to murderous governments and rebel forces in Central
America and Africa whose depridations would make that
European diplomat’s skin crawl.<p><b> Iraq:  Powell for the
prosecution</b><p>U.N. members, if you prepare properly for
Powell’s presentation, you can make an invaluable
contribution to your own and the world’s understanding of
the true extent of Iraq’s threats to its neighbors and the
global community, as well as its links, if any, to al Qaeda.
If you’re not prepared, you could make a horrendous mistake
with unfathomable repercussions. <p>Powell’s presentation
will be in the form of “here is the unvarnished truth as we
understand it.”  But his will be a case for the prosecution
and should be viewed as such.  He will present only those
tidbits that strengthen his case while suppressing tidbits
that undermine it — and he will have a great advantage over
a prosecutor in an American court.  <p>You see, that
prosecutor would earlier have taken part in what is called
the “discovery” phase.  The rules differ by state and by
type of case, but the idea is that both sides in a trial get
access to just about all the information and evidence the
other side has gathered.  You, on the other hand, will not
be privy to the mountain of evidence from which Powell has
selected his damning tidbits.  You won’t have access to the
material that places each accusation in its proper context,
or the material that weakens or directly contradicts each
accusation.  <p>Nor will you know if certain evidence is
unreliable because it was obtained through torture.  On
Monday Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights
Watch, wrote a letter to Powell (<small><a href=
http://hrw.org/press/2003/02/powell-ltr020303.htm target="_new">
http://hrw.org/press/2003/02/powell-ltr020303.htm</a></small>)
urging him to denounce the use of torture and not to include
in his presentation any “information” obtained through
torture or severe mistreatment.  (An in-depth story in the
Dec. 26 Washington Post, cited by Roth, indicates the
administration now countenances torture.)  Would the Bush
administration permit U.S. intelligence agencies to torture
directly and/or ship detainees to foreign torture centers in
hopes of extracting the magic words “Saddam and al Qaeda —
all for one and one for all”?  You might want to ask
Secretary Powell.<p><b> The tubes:  What did Powell know and
when did he know it?</b><p>Powell has known for many months
that officials in his own State Department, as well as
experts in the Energy Department, doubted that those
aluminum tubes Iraq tried to purchase were intended for use
in a nuclear-weapons program.  Yet Powell stood by as
President Bush delivered three major speeches where he
stated as incontrovertible fact that Iraq’s purpose for the
tubes was nuclear.  If the president wanted to mislead the
American people — to scare them into supporting his desire
for war — that was just fine with Powell.  <p>It was in
President Bush’s September speech to your body, the United
Nations, that he made his first categorical statement that
Iraq had attempted to purchase aluminum tubes necessary for
building centrifuges for the enrichment of uranium.  He
didn’t say that the tubes “could” be used in a nuclear
project, or that “we have grave concerns” that this might be
the case.  He didn’t say what he and Powell knew to be true:
“Even though we lean hard on all our intelligence pros to
put the worst possible spin on Iraqi actions, the truth is
that many of our best people make a persuasive case that the
tubes are for a non-nuclear program.”   <p>Bush repeated his
categorical statement about the tubes’ nuclear purpose in a
national address October 7.  He repeated it again January
28, in his State of the Union address.  Between the two
speeches, evidence continued to mount that the tubes were
indeed for the purpose that Iraq told the U.N. inspectors: 
for conventional artillery rockets.<p>We now know, thanks to
the work of Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick (not to be
confused with pretend-reporter and Powell-mouthpiece Bob
Woodward), that the nuclear theory had plenty of holes from
the start (“U.S. Claim on Iraqi Nuclear Program Is Called
Into Question” (<small><a href=
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35360-2003Jan23.html target="_new">
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35360-2003Jan23.html</a></small>).<p>Amazingly,
the primary reason cited by CIA and Pentagon proponents of
the nuclear theory — the fact that Iraq was seeking tubes of
a precise size — is the strongest evidence for the
conventional-rockets theory!  (So much for the pretense by
Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz that the CIA is too eager to dismiss
allegations of Iraqi misdeeds.)  In fact, the 81mm tubes
were a perfect fit for the conventional-rocket program that
dated back to the 1980s, and not even close to a fit for
centrifuges.  On Jan. 8, reports Warrick, Dr. el Baradei of
the IAEA issued his “preliminary assessment that the tubes
were ‘not directly suitable’ for uranium enrichment but were
‘consistent’ with making ordinary artillery rockets -- a
finding that meshed with Iraq’s official explanation for the
tubes.”  Yet on Jan. 28, the president continued to pretend
otherwise in a nationally televised speech, confident that
the major U.S. news media would let him get away with one
more lie.  Confident that his much admired and respected
secretary of state would side with him, rather than the
American people who were the target of the lie.<p><b> Big
lies that go unchallenged produce big results for Bush and
Powell</b><p>Recall what else Bush was saying around the
time he first told his tall tubular tale:  He was trying to
scare the hell out of the American people and Congress with
warnings about the grave and imminent nuclear threat posed
by Saddam.  At a Sept. 7 news conference, Bush said, “I
would remind you that when the inspectors first went into
Iraq and were denied — finally denied access [in 1998], a
report came out of the Atomic — the IAEA that they were six
months away from developing a weapon.  I don't know what
more evidence we need.”  But as Joseph Curl reported three
weeks later in the conservative Washington Times, there was
no such report:  “In October 1998, just before Saddam kicked
U.N. weapons inspectors out of Iraq, the IAEA laid out a
case opposite of Mr. Bush’s Sept. 7 declaration:  ‘There are
no indications that there remains in Iraq any physical
capability for the production of weapon-usable nuclear
material of any practical significance,’ IAEA
Director-General Mohammed Elbaradei wrote in a report to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan” (<small><a href=
http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020927-500715.htm target="_new">
http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020927-500715.htm</a></small>).
<p>But Bush’s lie was reported widely as fact, and along
with other lies it has had a tremendous impact on public
perceptions.  According to a recent Knight-Ridder poll, 41
percent of Americans believe Saddam has nuclear weapons
while only 24 percent know the truth:  he has none
(<small><a href=
http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/4911975.htm target="_new">
http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/4911975.htm</a></small>).
If Bush and Powell had a policy of leveling with the
American people, support for a war would plummet.<p>There is
a long list of lies and half-truths in Bush’s three major
speeches on Iraq, as the Institute for Public Accuracy
(<a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">accuracy.org</a>) and others have shown.  Each lie and
half-truth merits its own investigation, to determine just
how long that Powell and Bush have known it was all or
partly false, yet continued to peddle it.  It is bad enough
to take unconfirmed rumors and pass them off on the public
as certified facts.  But it is unconscionable to knowingly,
willfully mislead the American public and the community of
nations in order to trick them into waging a war of
aggression.<p><b> How to stage your own “discovery”
phase</b><p>You won’t have access to the raw data from which
Powell will build his case, but if you try hard enough you
can have the next best thing:  honest national-security
bureaucrats who’ve seen all this data and, in recent months,
have provided to the handful of serious reporters in
Washington careful analyses that directly contradict the
party line pushed by Powell and Bush.  These reporter
include the Post’s Joby Warrick, Knight-Ridder’s Jonathan
Landay and Warren Strobel (<small><a href=
http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/nation/1607676 target="_new">
http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/nation/1607676</a></small>
), and the Los Angeles Times’ Greg Miller and Bob Drogin
(<small><a href=
http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/la-na-cia11oct11.story target="_new">
http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/la-na-cia11oct11.story</a></small>).
<p>The reporters and their sources can help you start your
own “discovery” process.  It could begin the day of Powell’s
presentation and continue in the days and weeks that follow.
It can be carried out in a manner that safeguards
intelligence “sources and methods” and in conjunction with
those members of the U.S. Congress who are still eager to
have the free, open and honest debate they were denied last
fall.  <p>These dedicated, experienced officials, Landay and
Strobel report, “charge that the administration squelches
dissenting views and that intelligence analysts are under
intense pressure to produce reports supporting the White
House’s argument that Saddam poses such an immediate threat
to the United States that pre-emptive military action is
necessary.  ‘Analysts at the working level in the
intelligence community are feeling very strong pressure from
the Pentagon to cook the intelligence books,’ said one
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  A dozen other
officials echoed his views in interviews.  No one who was
interviewed disagreed.”<p>I can’t tell you their names.  I
don’t know them because they spoke to the reporters on the
condition they not be named.  Landay and Strobel explained
why:  “None of the dissenting officials, who work in a
number of different agencies, would agree to speak publicly,
out of fear of retribution.”<p>Powell is on the side of the
squelchers and the bullies.  He is no friend of the
frightened officials who want nothing more than for their
leaders to be honest with the American people.<p>Bring these
reporters to New York.  Ask them to tell you what their
sources told them.  Ask them how to reach their sources, and
plead with those sources to go public.   Tell them there is
safety in numbers.  If 20 blow the whistle, it will be
impossible for the White House to discredit them all.  Ask
dissident members of the U.S. Congress, former President
Jimmy Carter and retired General Anthony Zinni to echo your
plea.  It only takes a few brave bureaucrats to open the
floodgates for dozens more to follow.  <p>Only by bringing
these well-informed, honorable patriots out into the open
can U.S. citizens and the world community begin to have the
full, open and honest debate that we absolutely must have
before making such a momentous and fateful decision to go —
or not to go — to war.<p><b> The ultimate “team player” on a
team that cheats</b><p>All his career, Colin Powell has been
known as a “team player.”  But as was the case in the 1980s,
today he’s playing on a team that cheats.  Ponder for a
moment the words of the thoughtful Wall Street Journal
reporter David Wessel, writing in the December 12
edition:<p>“[T]his administration seems particularly proud
of its skill in misleading the press, the public and
Congress, when convenient.  It has even hired Elliott Abrams
and John Poindexter, both of whom were convicted of lying to
Congress about Reagan-era aid to Nicaraguan rebels. . . .  A
White House aide who had told me one thing on the record a
few weeks ago tried to persuade me over the weekend, not for
attribution, that the opposite was true.  I protested.  His
reply:  ‘Why would I lie?  Because that’s what I’m supposed
to do.  Lying to the press doesn’t prick anyone’s
conscience.’”<p>Lying to the press is the same thing as
lying to the public.  It’s a hallmark of the Bush team, and
Powell is its all-star.  Beware.<p>Sincerely yours,<p><a

<h3>Postscript:   More Reasons to
Be Wary of and Sickened by Powell</h3> <big> Human
Rights Watch says Powell files “fictitious” certification on
Colombia</big></center><p>On January 14, 2003, Human Rights
Watch (HRW) held a press conference to announce the release
of its latest world report.  Executive director Kenneth Roth
said that Powell’s State Department twice in 2002 issued
“fictitious” certifications that Colombia had met the
human-rights and rule-of-laws conditions that the U.S.
Congress had attached to Colombia aid.  Congress required
him to make an honest judgment, and HRW, Amnesty
International and the Washington Office on Latin America
demonstrate in a collaborative report that Powell did no
such thing (<small><a href=
http://hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/colombia-certification4.htm>
http://hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/colombia-certification4.htm</a></small>).
He says Colombia met all of the conditions; they say none. 
If you read the report, you’ll be hard-pressed to consider
this an “honest disagreement.”<p>Two of my own articles
(<small><a href=
http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0209-04.htm>
http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0209-04.htm</a></small>,
<small><a href=
http://www.colombiareport.org/colombia85.htm>
http://www.colombiareport.org/colombia85.htm</a></small>)
address Powell’s slippery — dare I say “Clintonesque” —
language in 2001 when the State Department designated the
AUC (a rightwing paramilitary death-squad federation in
Colombia) a “Foreign Terrorist Organization.”  The carefully
worded statement included not a hint of a relationship
between the AUC and the U.S.-backed Colombian army.  HRW
has, for years, documented that intimate working
relationship.  If Powell had acknowledged the obvious truth,
he and President Bush would have been placed in the awkward
position of justifying continued aid to an army that, in a
myriad of ways, aids and abets terrorists.<p><b> Powell
proud of his support for murderous contras</b><p>During the
1980s, thousands of Nicaraguan were murdered by a terrorist
rebel force known as the contras, which had been created by
the U.S. from the remnants of the hated National Guard of
the deposed Somoza dictatorship.  The U.S. organized, armed
and trained the contras, directed them to attack defenseless
Nicaraguan villages, and produced and distributed a handbook
that justified and encouraged the assassination of local
officials.   In 1986 the International Court of Justice
ordered the Reagan administration to end the contra war and
pay reparations to Nicaragua.  It did neither.<p>You can
read all about the contras in the gruesome reports of HRW,
whose careful documentation has stood the test of time. 
But, you ask, what does that have to do with Powell?  To
this day, Powell is proud of his contribution to the contra
cause.  Here’s what he said to journalists Norman Solomon
and Robert Parry in 1995:<p>“Working for Ronald Reagan as
his deputy national security adviser and national security
adviser, I worked very hard, fought very hard to get
adequate support to the contras, the freedom fighters, who
were resisting the communist government of the Ortegas in
Nicaragua.... I have no regrets about my role.” (<small><a
href= http://www.fair.org/extra/9601/powell.html>
http://www.fair.org/extra/9601/powell.html</a></small>)<p>According
to HRW, the contras made torture, murder of defenseless
civilians, and execution of surrendered enemy soldiers
standard operating procedure.  In the eyes of Powell, the
contras were “freedom fighters.” <p><b> A word on the U.S.
Ambassador to the U.N. John Negroponte</b><p>The Reagan team
had bribed the brutal generals who ran Honduras behind a
democratic façade to provide bases and sanctuary for the
contras.  You see, the contras, unlike a legitimate
guerrilla force, could not establish themselves in their own
country.  The CIA helped the worst of the Honduran military
set up a death squad called Battalion 316, which developed a
habit of torturing suspects to death.  The man whose job it
was to hush this up, to pretend that no systematic abuses
were being committed by our allies, was the U.S. ambassador.
His name is John Negroponte, and many U.S. senators, as well
as his predecessor in Honduras, consider him dishonest.  But
he’s a good friend of Powell’s, and today he’s the U.S.
ambassador to the U.N.<p><b> The only notable black American
to countenance Constructive Engagement</b><p>Ask your fellow
ambassadors from South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, the
Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and Namibia
what they thought of the “Reagan Doctrine” and of
“Constructive Engagement” with South Africa.  Ask them how
many of their countrymen were slaughtered in the 1980s as a
result of U.S. support for monsters named Savimbi and
Mobutu.  Ask them about the strategic alliance between
Powell’s president and the apartheid regime that was
destabilizing the entire southern African region.  The
number slaughtered as a direct result surely is in the
hundreds of thousands.  Ask these African ambassadors what
they think of a black man who is proud to have served in the
uppermost foreign-policy reaches of an administration that
conceived the abomination known as Constructive
Engagement.<p>No African American of stature other than
Powell would have willingly served as a cheerleader for the
Reagan Doctrine, with its murderous consequences in Africa
and beyond.  Perhaps this helps explain why Powell is so
beloved by the big names of America’s lilywhite,
center-right news media.<p><b> My background</b><p>I’m a
moderate liberal who, in the 1990s, taught courses on
American foreign policy and mass communications as an
adjunct (part-time) professor at the University of South
Florida’s St. Petersburg campus.  In the 1980s I wrote a
number of essays and book reviews on U.S. intervention in
the Third World and how the major U.S. media tended to stick
close to the White House party line (a tendency that’s in
full force today).  The essays appeared in Christianity &
Crisis, the National Catholic Reporter and the Berkshire
Eagle newspaper.  Today I write as an opponent of the
looming war, hoping to persuade you to join me in
opposition.  <p>I have no love for Saddam Hussein.  I regard
him as one of many brutal dictators whose most grisly crimes
were committed in the 1980s, when they had strong support
from the Reagan administration that Powell so loyally
served.  My preferred solution to the current crisis is for
Saddam to go into exile, with a 5-year grant of immunity
from international prosecution, after which he must fend for
himself.  He can come to my state, sunny Florida, where two
U.S.-backed Salvadoran generals whose human rights record is
nearly as appalling as Saddam’s are enjoying their
retirement in relative tranquility.
