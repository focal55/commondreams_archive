<p>Before the Iraq war, U.S. President George Bush declared the United Nations would condemn itself to "irrelevance" unless it endorsed military action. It did not. And now the folly of the U.S. going it alone without U.N. legitimacy is clear for all to see.

<p>American diplomats worked the Security Council's corridors yesterday trying to drum up interest in a new U.S. resolution giving the U.N. a bigger political role in Iraq's post-war reconstruction, appealing for more multinational troops under U.S. command, and asking for more aid.

<p>In short, Bush is looking to be bailed out as U.S. casualties mount, Iraqi anger rises, and terror grows. Far from delivering the democracy, peace and recovery they promised, the occupiers are presiding over a shambles.

<p>Bombs and mortars have shredded Iraq's key political and religious landmarks in recent weeks. The most revered shrine in Iraq was bombed, killing the country's senior Shi'a leader, Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, and 125 others. He was Bush's most important religious ally. The United Nations headquarters was destroyed, killing top envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello. Baghdad's police headquarters was bombed; the chief barely escaped. Abu Ghraib prison was mortared. The Jordanian embassy was bombed.


<p>The message? The Americans can't keep order and protect the Iraqis and institutions they need rebuilt, much less police the roads, and guarantee power and water supplies. Suddenly, no one feels safe. People are in the streets shouting "We'd rather have Saddam than this. There's no order, no government." So much for liberation.

<p>Bush is now spending $1 billion a week to keep 150,000 troops in Iraq, along with 11,000 British troops and 10,000 others. Yet he has precious little to show for it. Saddam Hussein is still on the loose, and Iraq is being infiltrated by fighters bent on driving the Americans out.

<p>This explodes the neo-conservative fiction that rebuilding Iraq as a stable democracy would be a cakewalk, once Saddam was deposed. 

<p>Every passing day validates Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's principled decision to have nothing to do with this war, absent U.N. approval. And as the post-war trauma deepens we can be grateful that Canadian troops are too busy stabilizing Afghanistan's capital to be drafted into Iraq's chaos.

<p>As yet, Bush's proposals for expanding the U.N.'s role remain sketchy.

<p>When the Security Council does weigh them, it should demand the U.N., not Washington, have the "central role" overseeing Iraq's new governing council and cabinet, with a clear timetable for drafting a new constitution, organizing democratic elections and restoring Iraqi sovereignty.

<p>Until then, Iraqis should run the country on a day-to-day basis, restore infrastructure and rebuild the army and police.

<p>And the U.S.-led military coalition should confine itself to battling Saddam's loyalists, protecting the new Iraqi authorities and U.N. personnel, and supporting the Iraqi security services as they are rebuilt.

<p>Above all, Iraq must be returned to self-rule quickly. Rule-by-outsiders is not a viable long-term option. It never was.
