<p>The six undecided countries on the
United Nations Security Council are in a tough
bind. If it were put to the vote of their people,
these nations would undoubtedly be against the
Iraq war, just like the rest of the world. But in
the spirit of the Godfather, President Bush is
making offers that they cannot refuse, so it's a
tough situation for these governments.

<p>The leaders of these countries will have
to weigh their choices carefully, but there is
some advice that we can give them about
dealing with President Bush: get the money up
front. As New York Times columnist Paul
Krugman recently pointed out, President Bush is
not a man who lets past commitments interfere
with his freedom of action. In other words, his
promises don't mean very much.

<p>In the 2000 election, education was one
of his main themes as he promised to "leave no
child behind." In 2001 he got Congress to
approve a large increase in education funding as
part of this commitment. Now he is proposing
substantial cutbacks in education spending, so
that there will be enough money to pay for more
tax breaks for the wealthy. He also refuses to
assist state and local governments that are being
forced to close schools and libraries in order to
balance their budgets.

<p>After the September 11th attacks he
promised a large aid package to help New York
rebuild. The people of New York are still
waiting for most of that money. He also
promised increased funding of homeland
security to protect ports, bridges, and other
vulnerable targets against terrorist attacks. Here
too he has not delivered, as the appropriations
he requested are far too small to meet the need.

<p>President Bush's list of broken promises
is impressive for a man who has held office for
just over two years. The willing should keep this
in mind when he asks for their support at the
UN Security Council.

<p>Even if he were sincere, it is not clear
that President Bush would be able to meet his
commitments to the new coalition. Our rapidly
expanding budget deficit is only one of the
obstacles to paying for Security Council votes.
The other big problem is the trade deficit. Some
of the willing may be selling their vote in
exchange for greater access to the U.S. market.
This might make sense if the U.S. presented a
growing market for imports. Unfortunately this
is not the case.
<p>The United States has a current account
deficit that was running at close to a $550
billion annual rate at the end of 2002. A deficit
of this size cannot be sustained for long. Until
now, foreign investors have been willing to
support this deficit by purchasing U.S. financial
assets, such as stocks, bonds, and short-term
notes. But they have been suffering huge losses
on these investments in the last couple of years.
Investing in euro-denominated bonds and notes
would have provided far greater returns than
dollar-denominated bonds or notes.

<p>At some point foreign investors will stop
throwing away money by buying U.S. financial
assets, and the dollar will fall. When this
happens the U.S. market will shrink -- imports
are likely to decline by $200 to $300 billion
annually. Having greater access to a shrinking
market is not worth very much. In this case, the
willing will have sold their votes for nothing.

<p>In short, the undecided countries will
get what they see up front. But they could well
end up with a net loss: the war will have a
serious negative impact on the world economy.
The IMF has estimated that a war that goes
badly could knock two percentage points, or
more than $800 billion, off of world economic
growth. This is an enormous loss, but even a
much smaller negative impact of the war could
easily wipe out any gains that the willing accrue
from the bribes that are actually paid up front.

<p>Unfortunately for the willing there is no
court to enforce bribery agreements at the UN.
And even if there were, the Bush administration
would ignore it. So the governments that trade
away their votes on the Security Council will
get what they see up front, minus their losses
from the war. They should make sure that this is
a high enough price for selling their souls.
