<p>What is President Bush doing with the popular support he has received from the victory in Baghdad? First, he pushed through his tax cuts that gave over one-fourth of the benefits to millionaires even while schools are laying off teachers and shutting down after-school programs. Now he is after your paycheck and your weekend.

<p>In March, the Bush administration proposed administrative changes in the Fair Labor Standards Act. Bush's ''technical changes'' will deprive millions of workers of overtime pay.

<p>Call it an employer's bill of plunder. Bush's proposal would exclude workers previously protected under the act by allowing employers to classify them as ''managers'' or administrative and professional employees who are not eligible for overtime. Serving the customers at Wal-Mart, you're a manager, not an employee. Forget about the 40-hour week.

<p>The president also would make those earning more than $65,000 a year ineligible for overtime protections. Republicans always ask what do Democrats mean by ''the rich.'' Well, now we know what Republicans mean--anyone earning over $65,000 is too ''rich'' for overtime pay.

<p>And the president would strip overtime protection from large numbers of workers in aerospace, defense, health care, high-tech and other industries. During the war, Republican Sen. Ted Stevens suggested that New York's cops and firefighters should work overtime without pay as a wartime sacrifice. ''I don't know why the people working for the cities and counties ought to be paid overtime when they're responding to matters of national security,'' he said. The president has applied that principle to workers in critical industries. 

<p>But Bush's congressional partners, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, are pushing for more. This week, they'll vote on legislation that would allow employers to give workers ''time off'' rather than pay them time and a half for overtime. They paint it as a family-friendly measure, designed to help working parents by rewarding them with time off rather than pay. Whenever Frist and DeLay start talking about family-friendly measures, you all should hold onto your wallets.

<p>In fact, the bills give the employer the control over when--and even if--a worker is allowed to use comp time. The bills do not have any protection against employers who require workers to accept comp time, rather than cash, or sanctions against employers who assign overtime only to those willing to take time off instead of cash. And in the Senate bill, the 40-hour work week is eliminated for an 80-hour two-week work period. If you are required to work 50 hours one week and 30 the next, you don't get overtime pay--you're just working 80 hours over two weeks. 

<p>For employers, this is a bonanza. You demand that workers work overtime. You don't have to pay them anything. Their projected compensation goes into a corporate time bank. When orders slow down, the employer tells you to take your comp time. If business is brisk and you want to take the time, the employer can refuse. You've essentially given the employer a tax-free loan for the pay that you have not gotten.

<p>he Economic Policy Institute analyzed the Republican bills (HR 1119 and S 317) and concluded: ''There is nothing in the bill for workers except rhetoric and slick marketing. Not only will employees who substitute comp time earn less, so will employees who refuse comp time and insist on being paid. . . . Employers will assign overtime preferentially to those who accept comp time, thereby depriving the workers who need the extra cash of overtime work.''

<p>Everyone knows this is the CEO administration that has perfected crony capitalism: an energy plan for and by big oil, a prescription drug plan for and by the drug companies, an environmental policy by and for the polluters' lobby. But this is ridiculous. Taking away the weekend and overtime pay in the name of ''flexibility'' may be good marketing, but it isn't good policy. In this minefield, it is clear who gets the gold and who gets the shaft.
