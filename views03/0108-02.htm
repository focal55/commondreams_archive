<p>Something weird is happening. It looked like a Gore-Bush battle again in 2004, but suddenly it seems that every member of Congress unhappy about being in the minority has decided to run for president.
<p>This is like a smorgasbord of Democratic choices, but nearly all of these guys look and sound similar (except Al Sharpton). But I have found the candidate who really represents our democratic constituency.
<p>It may take some deft maneuvers to skirt the constitutional provisions about being born in America, but if George Bush could get the Supreme Court to install him as president in the greatest trick since Wisconsin&#039;s own Houdini was on stage, it might be worth a try.
<p>My hero is Luiz Lula da Silva, the newly elected president of Brazil. In his inaugural address he announced the cancellation of contracts worth $760 million for the purchase of fighter jets.
<p>He explained: &#034;So long as there is a single Brazilian brother or sister going hungry, we have ample reason to be ashamed of ourselves. If at the end of my term every Brazilian can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, I will have completed my mission.&#034;
<p>Imagine a Democratic candidate for president saying, &#034;I will cancel all military contracts until every American has comprehensive health coverage.&#034;
<p>There are 25 million hungry Brazilians, according to the New York Times. While saving $760 million amounts to only $30 for each hungry Brazilian, it is refreshing to read about a leader willing to take on the real human needs within his own borders at the expense of the generals.
<p>We should work out a way to elect him in 2004. There are 40 million Americans working and unemployed who have no health insurance. Can we permit our brothers and sisters to live this way? I think not. Viva Lula!
<p>Instead of Lula, we have Bob Graham, Tom Daschle, Dick Gephardt, John Edwards and Joe Lieberman. Even Joe Biden, whose pathetic performance in the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings will never be forgotten, feels &#034;the call&#034; of the American people.
<p>Don&#039;t you wonder where these guys hang out? Where do they hear the call? I travel a fair amount, and I&#039;ve never heard anyone say, &#034;Gee, wouldn&#039;t it be great if Joe Biden or Joe Lieberman or Bob Graham were president?&#034;
<p>What is missing so far are the &#034;called&#034; Greens, disturbed independents and disaffected (thinking) Republicans. Candidates tell us what is wrong with Bush but the message is muffled when they speak about what they would do instead. If we get into &#034;I would be a better manager than Bush&#034; or &#034;I would cut taxes for the wealthy by only 40 percent instead of 50 percent,&#034; then we are in for a ridiculous election.
<p>We need a Paul Wellstone, a Bob La Follette, a Robert Kennedy to build a groundswell, but instead we get nicely packaged candidates who favor nuance over clear alternatives to the Bush agenda.
<p>Can&#039;t any of these candidates find their voice? Can&#039;t one of them join the growing group &#034;Not in My Name&#034; by clearly and decisively saying that attacking another nation is not in our tradition, it is immoral, and it must not be permitted?
<p>Charlie Rangel has it right. It is time to reinstate a draft because the American people who make policy, vote in elections and contribute to candidates would not put up with the notion of their child losing life or limb for this cowboy from Texas and Karl Rove. You can bet on that.
<p>Ah, but here at home we can appreciate living in a city with two newspapers with diametrically opposed editorial opinions. As Jim Doyle became the first Democratic governor in 16 years, the State Journal reminded readers of the unsuccessful term of John Reynolds. In Reynolds&#039; case it was two years and out; the State Journal regrets it will take four to get rid of Doyle. The Capital Times, on the other hand, conjures up Gaylord Nelson&#039;s clarion call of 1959. And while I keep fingers crossed that Gov. Doyle will be a second Nelson, there is an old saying that you should &#034;pray for peace but keep your powder dry.&#034;
<p>Citizen groups that sprang up under Tommy Thompson to protest state support of Perrier, the Crandon mine and poorly sited ethanol plants must not put down their picket signs or cancel next month&#039;s meeting. The grain producers who hired lobbyist Bill Broyderick to push through ethanol plants will not suddenly see the light. As one of them put it the other day, &#034;Same circus, different clowns.&#034;
<p>The big boys never stop. They can switch from Republican to Democrat as quickly as the circus audience can shift from one circle to the next, and never miss a beat. Example No. 1: The highway lobby was nervous for a month but is now in ecstasy over the appointment of Frank Busalacchi as state transportation secretary. They will have an ally to pave over the entire state so they can start repairing their work in eight years.
<p>This is no time to relax for citizens who depend on local democracy to save their environment, fight sprawl, develop serious smart growth policies, and stop the invasion of the big boxes. We can pull for Doyle but keep our powder dry. The stakes are too great to put all our savings on one horse.
<p><i>Ed Garvey is a Madison lawyer who was the Wisconsin Democratic candidate for governor in 1998.</i>
