<p>ANY HOPE that Congress will address the nation's overreliance on fossil fuels and the climate change they cause faded last week with the Senate's decision to punt on energy policy. Unable to win agreement on a new energy bill larded with subsidies for the oil, gas, coal, and nuclear industries, the Senate's Republican leaders Thursday decided simply to approve the scarcely better version that had passed a year ago under Democratic leadership. That one died in conference committee with the GOP-led House. 

<p>GOP senators are openly saying that in conference committee negotiations with the House they will tack on some of the provisions that failed in the full Senate. If the bill that emerges from the conference committee is as lacking in measures promoting conservation and renewable energy as both the current House and Senate bills, it should be defeated on the floor. No bill is better than these giveaways to the energy industry. 

<p>To make matters worse, the Bush administration was found to have suppressed research on greenhouse gas emissions. Leaked documents from the Environmental Protection Agency revealed that the EPA had buried an analysis of a plan to curb carbon dioxide emissions backed by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. The researchers' preliminary result indicated that the measure -- which the two senators hoped to include in the energy bill -- would not have a seriously adverse impact on the economy. 

<p>The McCain-Lieberman approach runs counter to the administration's ineffectual plan for voluntary emission reductions by industry. Administration officials and their allies in Congress worry that curbing the economy's appetite for hydrocarbon fuels would cripple it. 

<p>Lieberman, on the other hand, says that meeting the reductions in his measure would create high-tech jobs and be only a minor drain on the economy. Under his and McCain's plan, CO2 emissions in 2010 would be cut back to their 2000 level, a less Draconian standard than the Kyoto international treaty on global warming calls for. 

<p>But rather than stand by the study by her own researchers, former EPA head Christine Todd Whitman in June wrote to McCain that the Energy Department was doing an analysis of his bill. Its estimates of the costs of the legislation, she told McCain, ''should not be significantly different from the estimates that EPA would have produced.'' 

<p>In fact, the estimates were radically different. The Energy Department concluded that the McCain-Lieberman bill would shrink the economy by $106 billion in 2025. The EPA study's preliminary finding was that the economic loss attributable to the measure would be only between $1 billion and $2 billion. 

<p>Whatever happens to the energy bill, McCain and Lieberman still hope to have a Senate vote on their plan. Its chances of passage would be greater if the administration were not burying an analysis by its own staffers showing the plan would make environmental gains with little effect on the economy. The country will never solve problems like climate change if its elected officials hide research and let politics trump science.
