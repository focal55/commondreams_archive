<p>No, the <a href="http://www.mediacampaign.org/" target="_new">White 
                House anti-drug ads</a> don't work, the latest, stealth report 
                from the federal government indicates. Commissioned by the Office 
                of National Drug Control Policy and conducted under the auspices 
                of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, it states: &quot;There 
                is no evidence yet consistent with a desirable effect of the [Media] 
                Campaign on youth.&quot; Though this semi-annual report builds 
                on the poor results documented previously, the taxpayer-funded 
                ads - despite their demonstrated inability to keep kids from drugs 
                - do serve any number of purposes. One new use for the campaign 
                made its debut during the year's high-profile advertising showcase, 
                Sunday's Super Bowl.</p>
 <p> As Joseph R. Giganti, Director of Media 
                and Government Relations at the American Life League stated after 
                reviewing the new anti-marijuana ad - entitled &quot;Pregnancy&quot; 
                - on ONDCP's website, &quot;Without question, there is a very 
                strong but subtle pro-life statement presented in this commercial.&quot;</p>
 <p> Saying that &quot;abortion on demand&quot; 
                thrives on the notion that actions lack consequences, Giganti 
                added, &quot;This ad reinforces the consequences.&quot; Still 
                commenting on the ad, he said, you can't &quot;just slice and 
                dice a baby and everything'll be good.&quot;</p>
 <p> As to the ad's outcome of a young teenager 
                having her baby, Mary Jane Gallagher, Chief Operating Officer 
                of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said, &quot;They coded the message 
                to make it seem this was this woman's only option.&quot; According 
                to Gallagher, &quot;Such speaking down to viewers - that keeping 
                the child is the only alternative - I'm not used to that from 
                the government in a democracy.&quot;</p>
 <p> Alerted to the ad, Nellie Gray, President 
                of the March for Life Fund and organizer of the annual anti-Roe 
                v. Wade demonstrations in Washington, said: &quot;A government 
                agency properly uses this scene of a pregnant mother's drug abuse 
                and grandparents' youth to help viewers understand that there 
                is no justification for anyone intentionally killing a preborn 
                baby.&quot; As to any possible ill effects on the baby from the 
                mother's &quot;drug abuse,&quot; Gray added that her group has 
                a &quot;no exceptions, no compromise&quot; policy on abortion.</p>
<p> I've reported on the Clinton White House 
                granting the networks some $22 million in ad time they owed it 
                in exchange for inserting <a href="http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v00/n043/a09.html?126" target="_new">government-approved</a> 
                (and even <a href="http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/01/13/smart_guy/" target="_new">government 
                scripted</a>), anti-drug plots in TV shows. More than one source 
                worried that if the government got away with that, there'd be 
                scant reason to limit its social engineering to drugs. Someday, 
                some administration gripped by a perceived responsibility to instruct 
                people how to live might soon train its sights on reproductive 
                rights, or so these First Amendment advocates thought. Fearing 
                that anti-abortion themes might conceivably start cropping up 
                in sitcoms and dramas, no one worried they'd be flaunted in the 
    ads themselves.</p>
 <p> Well, the Clinton Federal Communications 
                Commission eventually ruled the government couldn't pay for messages 
                embedded in TV shows without alerting viewers to that fact. Such 
                notice robbing those messages of much of both their ability to 
                influence viewers and their appeal to government social marketers, 
                the Bush administration commendably scrapped that part of its 
    anti-drug campaign.</p>
 <p> However, it took only about a year of his 
                running the national ad campaign for Bush Drug Czar John Walters 
                to launch his first attack on abortion in the guise (or so said 
                the two anti-abortion activists quoted above) of his increasingly 
    outrageous ads.</p>
 <p> The woman holding the pregnancy test strip 
                in the ONDCP Super Bowl ad is certainly young and curvy enough 
                that, in a cute little bit of misdirection, viewers no doubt assumed 
                the test was for her, especially since her daughter is off-camera. 
                But we soon learn the parents of the girl who looks about 14 and 
                got pregnant via the demon weed, are - pay attention now, America 
                - soon to be, &quot;the youngest grandparents in town.&quot; Ramming 
                the point home, the ad tells us, &quot;There will be an addition 
                to their family soon.&quot; As for the also young, but balding 
                grandfather-to-be, he probably doesn't look nearly as frayed by 
                life as he soon will.</p>
 <p> That's because, in the ad's self-contained 
                world, options apparently aren't available to this family. &quot;Youngest 
                grandparents&quot; - that's the only outcome that's indicated. 
                And, as mom embraces her, the ad ends with the young girl's face 
                registering fear and what looks like acquiescence as we're informed: 
                &quot;Smoking marijuana impairs your judgment - it's more harmful 
    than we all thought.&quot;</p>
 <p> For many, of course, having the baby would 
                indeed be their choice. But - for now, anyway - there are other 
                choices, not that viewers would glean that from a government ad 
                that seeks to model 'correct' behavior. Gallagher, of NARAL Pro-Choice 
                America, asserted that, &quot;The government's message didn't 
                portray the legal options available to this young woman under 
                Roe v. Wade: to keep the child, to put the child up for adoption, 
                or to seek a safe and legal abortion.&quot;</p>
<p> Katherine Minarik, Director of Campus Programs 
                for the Feminist Majority Foundation, said that government commercials 
                should try to paint a picture of reality. &quot;And if in that 
                picture you eliminate the concept of reproductive freedom, then 
                you're doing an enormous disservice to not only the health, but 
the lives of young people.&quot; </p>
 <p> Saying that her legal team will ponder action 
                regarding the ad's public funding (the total ONDCP Super Bowl 
                ad buy exceeded $4 million), Gallagher said, &quot;We can't let 
                this effort go unchecked - that they take these social policies 
                that run counter to the majority of Americans' views and push 
                them down our throats.&quot;</p>
 <p> Ken Diem, Chairman of the New York State 
                Right to Life Party, countered that government advertising, &quot;should 
                be promoting abstinence and respect for your body, which involves 
                no drugs and no promiscuity.&quot; Saying that the ad meshes well 
                with his party's concerns, Diem said, &quot;The government should 
                promote an abstinence program hand-in-hand with the anti-drug 
                message.&quot; In fact, he'd like to see it part of any Bush administration 
                faith-based initiative. As to any criticism of the government's 
                involvement in the abortion issue, Diem said, &quot;Poppycock. 
                The government has been involved with a woman's right to choose 
                since day one. Only when the government stands up to respect the 
                sanctity of life do they cry foul.&quot;</p>
 <p> Minarik agreed with Gallagher that the ad 
                makes it appear the young woman has but one option. &quot;But 
                teenagers still have choices after an unintended pregnancy. And 
                we as a society can never let them believe they have no choice. 
                This is just another example of a broader policy of eliminating 
                access to needed information on reproductive health,&quot; she 
                said.</p>
 <p> Everything old is new again. Harry Anslinger, 
                Walters' ideological and official progenitor both, could have 
                warned the ad's father to lock his daughter away from those fiends 
                hopped up on that reefer stuff. This a new century, not Anslinger's 
                1930s, the young wanton was apparently a willing participant, 
                wacked as she was herself on pot. How else to explain a teenage 
                girl falling prey to a boy's pressure? (Simple decency requires 
                shrinking from the notion of such a young girl's lasciviousness 
                unmediated by marijuana.)</span></p>
           
 <p> Giganti said the point that sex has its 
                consequences is driven home by the girl's &quot;fearful&quot; 
                expression as the ad ends. There's no &quot;easy solution&quot; 
                to this family's dilemma, he said. &quot;It's realistic that the 
                parents are concerned.&quot; He applauded that they're not being 
                &quot;complicit in the murder of their own grandchild.&quot; By 
                being &quot;loving, concerned and comforting,&quot; the parents 
                are &quot;taking a bad situation and making the best of it.&quot;</p>
 <p> Gallagher, however, felt the ad was wildly 
                unrealistic: &quot;It indicates this will be easy for the family 
                to tackle. It's absurd.&quot; </p>
 <p> Giganti doubted that Walters intentionally 
                sat down with his creative team and in the context of a hard-hitting 
                ad for teens, reached for a message on abortion. Acknowledging 
                the ads' &quot;subtext,&quot; Giganti said, &quot;I don't know 
                if it's intentional. I believe not.&quot; He added, &quot;I don't 
                think it was set up to reflect a pro-life view. Though in a perfect 
                world that might be what happens.&quot;</p>
 <p> The ad was created gratis by McCann-Erickson 
                Worldwide Advertising and filtered through the Partnership for 
                a Drug-Free America for subsequent approval and purchase of airtime 
                by ONDCP. Both the partnership (which, to its credit, has refused 
                to get involved with the White House drugs = terrorism ads) and 
                ONDCP declined comment. McCann-Erickson refused to make its creative 
                team available for an interview; spokeswoman Susan Irwin would 
                say only that McCann-Erickson was &quot;responsible for the idea.&quot; 
                Irwin elaborated no further, so it would seem, therefore, that 
                the get-pregnant, have-the-child (though you're a child yourself) 
                message originated on Madison Avenue.</p>
 <p> Since McCann-Erickson won't say that Smith 
                or Jones on its staff cooked up the idea -- and what prompted 
                their thinking -- what remains clear is that the White House approved 
                the ad. And it paid for its inclusion in the year's most-watched 
                show amidst all the other high-profile ads that debuted on Sunday.</p>
 <p> This came less than a week after President 
                Bush addressed by phone hookup a massive anti-choice protest in 
                Washington seeking to overturn Roe v. Wade. Voicing his hope to 
                ban a type of late-term abortion he termed &quot;partial-birth&quot; 
                abortion, Bush spoke on the 30th Anniversary of the Supreme Court 
                decision. He told the crowd that a &quot;self-evident truth calls 
                us to value and to protect the lives of innocent children waiting 
                to be born.&quot; Not wanting to risk a photograph of himself 
                at the rally for later use by pro-choice advocates (and yes, he 
                was out of town, but the anniversary occurs on the same date every 
                year), Bush continued Ronald Reagan's weaselly tradition of addressing 
                the annual protest only by telephone.</p>
 <p> Lest you un-American eggheads who don't 
                watch television and don't let your kids watch consider yourselves 
                immune to the ads, consider this from an ONDCP press release: 
                &quot;[T]he Campaign is designed to reach Americans of diverse 
                backgrounds wherever they live, learn, work, play and practice 
                their faith.&quot;</p>
 <p>&quot;Play&quot; I knew about, having seen 
                a White House ad emblazoned on the backboard at my local glass-strewn, 
                schoolyard basketball court, the bent, naked rims without a net. 
                (Never mind the social science proving that spending on decent 
                athletic facilities, along with the after-school programs to use 
                them, go further than any TV ads to keep kids from abusing drugs.) 
                But I haven't detected the White House's heavy hand in my quirky 
                little church yet. Given the administration's evident willingness 
                to breach the church-state divide, perhaps it's only a matter 
                of time.</p>
