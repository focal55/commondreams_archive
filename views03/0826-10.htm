<p>"It's official - Saddam was not an imminent threat," read the headline in weekend editions of Britain's Guardian newspaper. 

<p>London's Daily Mirror declared: "NO THREAT - Revealed: E-mail from Blair's top man said Saddam was NOT imminent danger." The lead editorial in The Independent newspaper declared, "Now we know that No. 10 did order a rewrite of the dossier to justify war." 

<p>For the most part, American media is doing a lousy job of following the British investigation of how Blair and his aides spun the case for war with Iraq. Hopefully, that will change this week, as Blair takes the stand in the inquiry. After all, the story of official deceit in Britain is also the story of official deceit in the United States. 

<p>When Bush was trying to con Congress into giving him a blank check to launch a war with Iraq last fall, the president's efforts were hindered by his rather serious credibility gap. Veteran members of the U.S. intelligence community were signaling - from behind the scenes and, in some cases, publicly - that they did not buy the argument that Iraq posed a serious enough threat to merit military action. 


<p>And senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including former chair Bob Graham, were asking what had happened that would require a dramatic change in U.S. policy. Other members of Congress, such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee members Russ Feingold, a Democrat, and Lincoln Chafee, a Republican, said the U.S. should focus on fighting terrorism, as opposed to squandering resources to remove a secular Iraqi leader who was at odds with the Islamic fundamentalists of al-Qaida. 

<p>Bush was even having trouble with some top Senate Republicans, who were talking about the need to attach some strings to the resolution authorizing the administration to use military force against Iraq. 

<p>The president was able to evade those restraints, and to thwart congressional debate on the Iraq issue, by flashing around a so-called "intelligence dossier" prepared by the office of British Prime Minister Blair. Widely viewed as a more moderate player than Bush, Blair was supposed to be the sensible partner in the emerging "coalition of the willing." 

<p>Dozens of members of Congress who had expressed doubts about the Bush administration's case for war say they were influenced by the dossier - which appeared less than three weeks before the October 2002 congressional votes - to believe that Iraq was aggressively developing weapons of mass destruction and that those weapons threatened the world. Now, however, it turns out that the dossier was doctored. New revelations from Britain are confirming the skepticism of objective members of Congress - including Graham, Feingold and Chafee - who last fall rejected the so-called "evidence" as insufficiently credible to legitimize the blank check. 

<p>Britain's independent investigation, led by Lord Hutton, a respected senior jurist, was launched to answer questions about the death of David Kelly, a British expert on chemical and biological weapons, who helped reporters expose the Blair team's manipulation of intelligence data. But it has turned into a broad examination that is considering information not merely regarding Kelly but the whole question of how Blair and his aides made the case for war. 

<p>Last Tuesday, Hutton released copies of e-mails revealing that Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, cautioned against using the dossier to claim Iraq posed anything akin to "an imminent threat." After reviewing the evidence, Powell e-mailed top members of the prime minister's team to argue that the information "does nothing to demonstrate a threat, let alone an imminent threat from Saddam." 

<p>The prime minister's chief of staff found the evidence on which the dossier was based so thin that he said it would only be "convincing for those who are prepared to be convinced." 

<p>Blair and his top aides chose to disregard the cautions and hyped the dossier with claims that it confirmed Iraq's WMD program was "active, detailed and growing." Even after U.S. intelligence agencies warned that the dossier was of questionable validity, Bush peddled the dubious data. 

<p>This week's revelations about the extent to which Blair and his aides massaged and manipulated the intelligence data should suggest to members of the U.S. Congress that it is time for the United States to again follow the lead of Britain. Congress should authorize a full investigation to determine whether, in the midst of a debate about war and peace, Bush and his cohorts chose to deceive Congress and the American people.
