<p>What a difference a year makes.

<p>On Sept. 12, 2002, President George W. Bush traveled to the United Nations and declared that the world body would be "irrelevant" if it didn't jump on his war bandwagon. The UN said "no," the war started, and yet Bush went back anyway, asking the suddenly relevant UN for help.

<p>Why did he do it?

<p>Easy. He's in big trouble. According to a new Gallup Poll, his approval/disapproval rating is 50:47. Indeed, he loses in head-to-head match-ups with both Wesley Clark and John Kerry - who, perhaps not coincidentally, are the two candidates in the race who went off to fight in Vietnam, back in the days when Baby Boomers had to decide whether to risk everything for their country.

<p>Bush is in trouble because he gambled, gambled big - and lost. He overplayed his war cards.

<p>After 9/11, the world rallied to America's side. Foreigners laid wreaths and lit candles in front of American embassies; the French newspaper Le Monde published a front-page editorial headlined, "We are all Americans." The German foreign minister, a member of the Green Party, sat in the Oval Office, wearing red, white and blue ribbons, and offered "unlimited solidarity." NATO mobilized for America. The UN condemned the 9/11 attack and endorsed American action against the terrorists.

<p>Within weeks, the Taliban and al-Qaida were gone from power in Afghanistan. If Bush had stopped there, he could have seized the moment to build a new world order based on collective defense against terrorism, a global alliance of countries wanting their big-city skylines to remain intact. And 90 percent of the countries in the world would have clamored to join, isolating the true rogues.

<p>But instead, he went down a different path. Spurning the multilateral approach that worked in Afghanistan - and still works, as measured by the polynational contingent of troops pulling peacekeeping duty to this day - he decided that the United States would go after Iraq, with or without the world. His neoconservative advisers and propagandists convinced him that he was another Winston Churchill, destined for world-historical greatness - if he just followed their unilateral-war guidance.

<p>So the Texan spent 2002 campaigning for a fight with Iraq. He gained support in the United States, even as he lost it around the world. Muslim allies such as Turkey peeled away. The UN Security Council opposed him; he couldn't even get the vote of his "friend," Russian chief Vladimir Putin. Parenthetically, one must note with wonder that Bush has never figured out that the ex-KGB man has been playing him like a balalaika. As he hosts Putin at Camp David tomorrow, it can be said that no president has been so trusting of the Russians since Franklin D. Roosevelt clinked glasses with Josef Stalin during World War II.

<p>And then of course, besotted with speechwriter-generated "moral clarity," Bush went to war anyway. The plan was to catch or kill Saddam Hussein, expose the weapons of mass destruction and get out clean. By now, the United States was supposed to have maybe 30,000 troops overseeing happy Iraqis electing a pro-American government and paying for their own reconstruction with oil money.

<p>None of those optimistic scenarios has come true. The president's latest rationale is that the war was fought to secure human rights in Iraq. His hard-core supporters have fallen loyally into line - although curiously, most opposed helping Liberia, and none demand action against mass slaughter in Congo.

<p>And Bush now has enemies on the right, too. Many of the neoconservatives who urged him into Iraq are now urging him to invade Syria and/or Iran - and making no secret of their disappointment in his not heeding them. Neo-hawk Mark Helprin, for example, writing in the Claremont Review of Books, dismisses Bush's entire Middle East policy as "ill-conceived" in its Iraq-only focus.

<p>That's what happens when a big mission fails. The opponents get close for the haymaker, and Machiavellian supporters get out of the way. And incidentally, he won't get much out of the UN.

<p>Bush might still hunker down at home, play to his base and win re-election. But his foreign policy "vision" has been shattered. The pieces that once reflected his own vain posturing are strewn across America. They are drenched in blood but, of course, it's not Bush's.
