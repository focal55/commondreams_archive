<p>As U.S. joblessness rises and consumer confidence falls, President Bush  
launched a preventive war against Iraq on March 19.  What are the likely 
economic effects of this action in America?

<p>Nobody knows.  But we can look at what is currently known.

<p>Recently, the Bush White House went on the record with a “concrete” 
estimate, its first, of $60 billion to $95 billion for a U.S.-led attack to 
disarm Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and “liberate” the Persian Gulf 
nation.

<p>“Don't believe either number,” wrote Paul Erdman, an economist and author, 
February 27 on CBS.MarketWatch.com.  “In the end we are going to be talking 
in terms of hundreds of billions of dollars.”

<p>He is hardly a radical.  This makes his view all the more notable.

<p>According to Erdman, the administration’s estimate of an Iraq war is 
incomplete.  The price tag fails to fully account for a U.S. postwar 
occupation of Iraq, plus payoffs for “support” to compliant nations (the 
coalition of the bullied and coerced).

<p>In all, invading and occupying Iraq could easily double the cost for 
American taxpayers to $200 billion.  Consider this.

<p>If the price of war against Iraq is $100 billion, each and every American 
citizen would pay approximately $375.  With a $200 billion bill, the cost 
would rises to about $750 per person in America.

<p>Thus for an average four-person household, a U.S.-led invasion and 
occupation of Iraq would result in an expenditure of between $1,500-$3,000.  
That’s dollars that won’t be spent in thousands of American communities on 
goods and services.

<p>This trend is the opposite of economic stimulation.  Even the Bush 
administration’s low estimate to invade and occupy Iraq will cause tens of 
billions of dollars to flow out of the American economy to invade, then 
occupy and rebuild Iraq.

<p>The cost to the U.S. taxpayer of this imperial action would also boost the 
federal budget deficit from a projected $300 billion upwards to maybe a 
half-trillion dollars (about five percent of the U.S. gross domestic 
product).   American taxpayers (businesses and consumers) will pay for such 
deficit spending in 2003 with tax hikes and spending cuts, plus the future 
financing of this public debt (payments for principal and interest).

<p>So much for the GOP being fiscally conservative.  In fact, the federal 
budget deficit is booming under Bush.

<p>By contrast, there were federal budget surpluses during the Clinton era.  
But crucially on his watch, the private debt of U.S. consumers and 
corporations doubled.

<p>Could the U.S. economy grow without accumulating such debt?  Just ask 
foreign lenders.

<p>Currently, they fund America’s trade deficit to the tune of $1.5 billion 
dollars each and every day.  This trend receives much less news coverage 
than the federal budget.

<p>Returning to the public debt front, the Bush White House plans to use the 
growing federal deficit as an excuse to hold down non-military spending.  
The bottom line?

<p>American taxpayers will buy more million-dollar cruise missiles.  Meanwhile, 
41 million people in the U.S. have no health care.

<p>Billions for bombs.  Where are the billions for people living in the richest 
nation to have health care?

<p>Meanwhile, energy costs are climbing, hammering the U.S. public.  
Nationally, the cost of energy with a petroleum base jumped 6.6 percent in 
January and 10.2 percent in February, according to the Department of Labor.

<p>And as U.S.-led forces strike Iraq, most every state in America is battling 
a budget deficit.  Think of the preventive war in Iraq as federal tax 
dollars being spent by the White House that could have instead flowed to the 
nearly 50 states going broke.

<p>Instead, current and projected spending cuts to balance state budgets are 
harming low- and middle-income people—kids, students, the aged and infirm.  
Many of them are questioning the fairness of this situation.

<p>And the prospect for federal tax revenues to recover from the recession that 
began two years ago?  Such an outcome is not likely in the short-term.

<p>Why?  Besides the Iraq attack, President Bush is also pushing for more tax 
cuts to benefit corporations and the well-heeled at the expense of ordinary 
people.

<p>In late imperial America, there’s no public budget crisis when it comes to 
using tax dollars to bomb Iraq into peace (pieces) or increase the bank 
accounts of the super rich.  At the same time, more of the American public 
is on its own to sink or swim as the nation’s economic crisis worsens.

<p>Will it become clearer that Bush’s preventive attack on Iraq is making life 
more economically precarious for the U.S. public?  If so, such a recognition 
could well serve as a bridge for more people to join the American anti-war 
movement.
