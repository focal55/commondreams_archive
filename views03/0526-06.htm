<p>At a recent staging of one of President Bush's 
speeches, White House aides asked members of the 
audience to take off their ties. These people would 
appear as background for the President's attempts to 
persuade the public that his latest round of tax cuts 
would primarily benefit ordinary people, and they 
needed to look the part.

<p>Backstage is another reality. One third of 
American taxpayers will get nothing from this tax cut, 
and more than half will get less than $100 for the 
year. Nor will the tax cuts provide much of a stimulus 
to the economy, which could really use one right now.

<p>But this legislation was not designed to jump-
start the economy, nor to help distressed families. The 
purpose is to rewrite the tax code so as to shift even 
more of the nation's income to the richest taxpayers.

<p>This is easy to see: if economic stimulus were 
the goal, you would want to increase spending in the 
economy. That means now, not two or three or ten 
years from now.

<p>So there is no need to rewrite the tax code, and 
create future deficits when the economy doesn't need 
them. A much more effective stimulus would be for 
the federal government to help the states. State and 
local governments are cutting back health care 
spending, laying off employees, even shortening the 
school year in a tragic attempt to balance their 
budgets. The shortfall is expected to exceed $100 
billion over the next year.	

<p>The Senate added to the tax bill some $10 
billion of aid to the states for each of the next two 
years, but that is not nearly enough to stem the 
bleeding. The administration had other priorities: 
getting rid of the tax that stockholders pay on 
dividends.

<p>"If you're a teacher, you own equities," said 
President Bush. "If you're a policemen, you own 
equities."  Maybe so, but the vast majority of people 
that hold stock-- including teachers and policemen -- 
do so in retirement accounts. So they will not benefit 
from the proposed dividend tax cut, since they will 
still have to pay taxes on their accumulated dividend 
income when they withdraw their money for 
retirement.
<p>The dividend tax cut will therefore go 
overwhelmingly to upper-income households. Not 
surprisingly, the whole tax package is skewed toward 
the rich: between 19 and 23 percent of the money will 
go to the four-tenths of one percent of taxpayers who 
make more than $500,000 a year.

<p>No fantasy appears too wild to be included in 
the marketing scheme. When asked about how the tax 
cut would affect the Federal budget deficit, Treasury 
Secretary John W. Snow replied "Well, it's actually 
going to be lower." But it's hard to find an economist 
 even among Republicans -- who believes this 
"Voodoo Economics," as President Bush's father 
aptly named it. 

<p>The Bush team cries "class warfare" when 
anyone questions why the well off and the super-rich 
need the tax code revised yet again in their favor. But 
what has been going on for the past three decades? 
From 1973-2001 the wages of a typical worker grew 
by about 7 percent -- almost nothing, as compared to 
the nearly 80 percent increase during the first half of 
the post-World-War II era.
<p>In other words, the gains from economic 
growth have all been going to the upper half -- and 
mostly to the upper 10 or 20 percent. A continual, 
one-sided "class warfare" has plagued this country for 
the past 30 years. This latest tax cut is just one more 
battle in that war, but it certainly won't be the last.
