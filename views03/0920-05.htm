<p><I>Let them eat cake.</I> 

<br>&#151; Attributed to Marie Antoinette
<P>If more is better, then things couldn't be better, although the juxtaposition is a bit awkward. Recent statistics show an increase in the wealth of the wealthy, the number of poor and the number of unemployed. Much of it can be attributed to the enlightened policies of the Bush administration, although the wealthy's increasing wealth was a work in progress when Mr. Bush became president and was simply enhanced by his enlightened tax cuts. 
<P>According to a report by Rorie Sherman, Editor in Chief of Trusts and Estates Magazine, the most recent Federal Reserve Board survey of consumer finances discloses that the rich in America have gotten even richer over the last few years. Ms. Sherman reports that the "[a]verage net worth of the top 10 percent of households increased by 30 percent to $2.75 million from 1998 through the end of 2001. Average income, assets and home value of the top 10 percent of households also increased in that time by 39 percent, 29 percent and 31 percent respectively." The survey interviewed 4,449 families and found that the remaining 90 percent of the population enjoyed gains as well, but in significantly smaller amounts. Income, assets and home value for that group increased on average 10 percent, 19 percent and 18 percent, respectively. 
<P>The survey results are hardly a surprise. In an effort to boost the economy, all sorts of tax cuts have been enacted under the watchful eye of George Bush and most of their benefit has been reserved for the very rich. Thanks to the tax cuts, those with incomes in excess of $1 million a year (which probably includes most of the folks in the top 10 percent) realize tax savings of more than $100,000, whereas those with exceedingly (or as they might put it, excessively) low incomes realized savings of less than $100. 
<P>The wealthy's good news was accompanied by census figures released on Sept. 2. They disclosed that at the same time the very rich were getting even richer and the rest of us were getting only slightly richer, there were a few leftovers who escaped this felicitous trend. They are those we prefer not to notice but who continue to force themselves into our collective consciousness because of their deplorable state, which is mostly attributable to their own lack of resourcefulness. They are the poor and the unemployed. 
<P>According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the number of Americans living below the poverty line (and thus not enjoying increased incomes, assets and home values) grew by more than 1.3 million people during the second year of the second Bush administration. The total percentage of people living in poverty in the wealthiest country in the world went from 12.1 percent to 12.4 percent, bringing the number of people who live in poverty to 34.8 million. Families living in poverty went from 6.6 million in 2001 to 7 million in 2002 and the number of children living in poverty rose from 11.6 million to 12.2 million. 
<P>Responding to the report, Stuart Butler, an economist with the American Heritage Foundation, was quoted in The New York Times as saying that the data were "a fairly predictable product of the slowing economy." He went on to say that: "The issue is, what do you do to continue to strengthen the economy? You take the necessary steps to encourage people to move back into the work force, plus making sure we don't do anything to weaken the welfare reforms put in place some years ago." 
<P>Which brings us to the final bit of good news, as it were. 
<P>On Sept. 5 the Labor Department announced that 93,000 jobs were lost in August, thus suggesting that a lot of people need encouragement to "move back into the work force." The problem is, if there are no jobs, encouragement is not terribly useful. Mr. Bush, being a compassionate sort, since he knows what it's like being a failure in business (having been that himself on more than one occasion), said in a speech that the unemployment report "shows we've got more to do. And I'm not going to be satisfied until every American who's looking for a job can find a job." 
<P>Being the president of everyone in the country, including the poor, he did not simply end his speech with meaningless words. He came up with great ideas on how the jobless could find work. In a speech given the same day as the new unemployment statistics were released, he articulated the solutions. He said that the tax cuts which have been so helpful to the very rich should be made permanent, which will, of course, be of great benefit to the unemployed. He called upon Congress to limit legal damages against doctors and corporations and urged it to permit more domestic oil and gas drilling. He also said Congress should ease up on regulating business. Although he didn't say it, given the context of the speech, it is obvious that he thinks once those things are done, jobs will magically reappear and the unemployed will once again become productive members of society. 
<P>Of course it will probably take a few weeks for Congress to do all those things. In the meantime, the unemployed should be patient. They know Mr. Bush cares about them and that's worth a lot even to the hungry.
