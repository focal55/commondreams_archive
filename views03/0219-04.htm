<p> One can almost sense a palpable shifting of momentum, from an unrestricted 
Bush war-juggernaut rolling to its bloody unfolding to an administration 
caught between Iraq and a hard place, condemned if it unleashes the dogs of 
war (imperial warmonger), condemned if it pulls back and bides its time 
(wimp).

<p>In a sense, what's transpiring reminds one of the delicious secret of "The 
Wizard of Oz": more and more people are beginning to sense, and sometimes 
even see, that the "all-powerful" governmental leader behind the curtain is 
just a flawed little man broadcasting to an overly-awed (and/or frightened) 
polity. Or, to shift fairytales: "The Emperor's New Clothes," where the 
leader, who has been nude all this while for all to see, suddenly finds that 
his subjects, heretofore willing to swallow the illusion of the emperor's new 
garments, realize that he's not wearing any.

<p>In short, Bush is just another leader -- not even an elected one at that -- 
who, to disguise his incompetency and true motives, has lived on propaganda and 
falsification, and now the jig is up. His citizens are beginning to see through 
the charade -- even many who once supported him, including a good many ordinary, 
moderate Republicans, appalled at the powers assumed by Big Government and its 
willingness to eviscerate the Constitution in its push toward more and more authoritarian 
control. 
<p>Certainly those outside the United States have seen through America's 
ostensible leader, and they, being more familiar with imperial arrogance, 
have not liked what they've seen. No, not at all. Even though they know they 
might pay a high price for telling the emperor to his face that he's full of 
bullbleep and that they refuse to have blood on their hands just because he 
says it's time to go to war, they have stood up. (Sad to say, there are some 
signs of wavering these days.)

<p>What's about to come down over the next several weeks doesn't look hopeful. 
Bush&Co. are pulling out all the stops -- threatening, bribing, cajoling, 
arm-twisting, bullying -- in an effort to smooth the path to war, to give 
fig-leaf cover to their rush to military onslaught devoid of overt evidence 
to justify the haste.  

<p>There IS going to be a war, you know. Bush&Co. will not have it any other 
way. The Bush&Co. domestic and global agenda requires it. How can you get 
your extremist domestic agenda passed unless a frightened Congress and 
populace rallies around the flag being unfurled in a Mideast desert? How can 
the U.S. exercise its "benevolent hegemony" of the globe (and totally by 
coincidence, have effective control of the world's natural resources) unless 
would-be upstarts get bombed to smithereens, to demonstrate to others that 
they'd better not make the same mistake of getting in our way? So, it's full 
speed to Baghdad.

<p>Doesn't matter if the allies are opposed, doesn't matter if thousands of 
Iraqi citizens get slaughtered as the missiles rain down (no wonder 
"Guernica" was covered up when Powell arrived at the U.N.), doesn't matter if 
North Korea insanely is threatening nuclear war against the U.S., doesn't 
matter if the American citizenry doesn't want a pre-emptive war on its 
conscience, doesn't matter if America is torn apart by dissension and 
economic disaster, doesn't matter if millions are demonstrating in the 
streets of America even before bombing has begun -- none of that matters. 
(Reminiscent of what Bush once told an ordinary citizen when that man deigned 
to criticize him at some public event: "What do I care what you think?") 

<p>But, let's clear up something right away. Iraq War #2 already has begun. U.S. 
special forces are currently operating in northern Iraq, moving to protect 
the oilfields from Saddam's orders to destroy them. U.S./British bombing of 
military targets is happening on a more frequent basis. Propaganda leaflets 
are already being released from U.S. planes over Iraq, warning soldiers not 
to follow the orders of their superiors to use biological or chemical 
armaments or risk "war crime" trials later. 

<p>So the war is on. All that's missing is "Shock & Awe" -- the U.S. plan for 
the first several days of missile attacks (hundreds and hundreds of them) 
aimed at Baghdad and Basra and elsewhere -- this to break the back and morale 
of Iraq's defense forces and to keep civilians from wanting to fight when the 
U.S./British troops arrive in downtown Baghdad. 

<p>There is little doubt that the U.S. onslaught will defeat the Iraqi forces -- 
ignoring for a moment what might happen if and when Saddam uncorks his 
biochem agents and aims them at the invaders. But, per usual when it comes to 
Bush foreign/military policy, little thought has been given to the 
consequences of what happens when the dogs of war are loosed on the world 
scene, especially on that ready-to-explode part of the world. (But this is in 
keeping with Bush&Co.'s we'll-deal-with-the-consequences-later domestic 
agenda -- for example, pushing for more tax cuts for the wealthy and 
corporate sectors in the face of an economy that already is in shambles 
because of earlier take-the-money-and-run policies.)

<p>So, here we are -- we liberals and progressives and radicals and moderates 
-- congratulating ourselves on our marvelous work of the past few months, building 
a stop-the-war coalition here and abroad that culminated in those fantastically 
impressive marches and rallies and demonstrations around the world and throughout 
the U.S. last weekend (perhaps as many as 11 million! peacefully protesting). 
True, those demonstrations were effective morale boosters and put the fear of 
electoral defeat in the rulers of a number of countries as they saw millions of 
their normally passive, ordinary citizens marching in the streets. 
<p>But Bush&Co. will have their war. So, what we in the opposition need to do 
now is to start reckoning with an overt, shooting-war situation: How can we 
throw sand into our government's war machine? How can we mobilize for peace 
candidates? How can we help the Democrats become a true party of opposition? 
How can we best help educate more of our fellow citizens -- the ordinary, 
somewhat-troubled middle-class ones sitting on the sidelines for now -- about 
the duplicity of our rulers and the dangerous policies being carried out in 
our names? How can we move toward impeachment for this incompetent, 
dangerous-to-American-interests Administration? 

<p>In short, how can we use the energies displayed on the streets in the past 
few months to build a dynamic, unstoppable Movement for peace and justice and 
economic recovery?

<p>Those of us who were active in the civil rights/anti-Vietnam War Movement of 
the '60s and '70s know how much work is involved in building to critical mass. 
it took years and years of hard, slogging work to educate and agitate and begin 
to change the way the great American muddle class saw the world and their political 
leaders devoid of illusion. 
<p>That transition can be accomplished much faster in 2003 -- especially given 
the speed with which news and information and communications can be 
disseminated these days, via the Internet and television and cell phones. 

<p>Don't get me wrong. It's not going to be easy. And it's going to come at a 
heavy price for many -- who will be persecuted, arrested, beaten, perhaps 
killed, censored, etc. -- as the forces of reaction fight tooth and nail to 
hang onto their greed-and-power agenda.

<p>But none of us doubts that the battle needs to be waged  -- in as creative 
and life-affirming way as possible. Let's continue to try to stop the war 
from happening, but, if -- as seems likely -- we can't, let's get our nascent 
Movement in gear and revved-up for the fight ahead. If you love your country, 
and your Constitution, and the world, and your kids, we can do no less. 
Onward!
