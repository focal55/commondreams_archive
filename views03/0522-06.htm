<p>Is Colin Powell going to apologize to Canada, the United Nations or France? With French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin in Ottawa today, it would be a good time to do so.

<p>Remember the 80-minute chest-thumping appearance before the UN Security Council on Feb. 5 in which the U.S. Secretary of State assured the world of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear arsenals or programs? These alleged horror stocks were the grounds for war. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of them, even for a few months, was "not an option."

<p>Canada, France and the UN weapons inspectors wanted more time and more proof. They weren't convinced. But Mr. Powell told them they were wrong -- and most everyone believed him. Journalists here and everywhere fell at his feet with paeans of praise. Irrefutable evidence, they said. Opinion polls racheted up in favour of war.

<p>French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin was one of the few to cast doubt on the validity of Mr. Powell's assertions. He was relentlessly ridiculed.

<p>In supporting the UN's more cautious approach, Jean Chrétien was belittled. The fact that the United States was saying there was proof meant he was supposed to jump through hoops. It was as though Washington had never lied or exaggerated threats in the past -- the McCarthyist Red Scare, the domino theory, the Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam, the mega-overstatements on Soviet arms buildups, the bombing of a non-existent chemical weapons lab in Khartoum, Bill Clinton's wag-the-dog bombings of Baghdad, the highly inflated numbers on Serb terror in Kosovo.

<p>For his tales of the great Iraqi arsenals, Mr. Powell was a hero -- until the facts came in. Then everyone found out they had been suckered. No weapons of mass destruction. A war on the basis of spurious assumption.

<p>Mr. Powell is praying that his masses of inspectors combing every inch of Iraq will come up with something. They probably will. In fairness, Mr. Powell said many of the stocks had been hidden.

<p>But whatever is found means little now. Even if Saddam Hussein had the weapons, he didn't use them. Not even in the war to end his regime. This makes mockery of the stated American reason for the aggression -- that with his "deadly" arsenal, he was an immediate threat.

<p>All this said, the war was won -- and it may well be a case in which the end justifies the means. Getting rid of the tyrant is a good thing even if he didn't possess the weapons. Washington did the job, and the Iraqi people will be the better for it. That is a victory.

<p>Even if the American military advantage was such that the war's outcome was comically predictable and even if it is grating to see George W. Bush on the strut, the world does have one less despot to worry about.

<p>No one can really assess the war's virtues or lack of them until it is known whether the prediction of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -- that the war might create 100 new Osama bin Ladens -- will come to pass.

<p>Mr. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair looked impressive until (a) the weapons argument turned out to be a crock, (b) the argument that the war would diminish terrorism turned to be a crock, and (c) the idea that it might facilitate a peace accord in the Middle East turned out to be a crock.

<p>Since Iraq hadn't been tied to recent terrorist activity, crushing the regime was hardly going to reduce terrorism. Going after a lizard doesn't get you the snake.

<p>But what is distressing is the misinformation, the exaggerations, the fabrications that Mr. Powell put out. What is discouraging is that, with his patriotic media, he knows he can get away with it. What is depressing is how U.S. intelligence can't be relied on to get anything right. How about those great savage armies Saddam Hussein was supposed to have to protect Baghdad? They were as non-existent as 30,000 chemical weapons and his advanced nuclear program.

<p>Mr. Powell has done much to diminish his credibility. In his own country, he can hide under the triumphalism of victory. But from now on, others will be hesitant to take him at his word. His lust for war outran prudence of judgment.

<p>For its own show of prudence, Canada took a lot of abuse from Mr. Powell's White House and Ambassador Paul Cellucci. No apology will be forthcoming. We can be sure of that -- no matter how wrong they were on the reason for the war.
