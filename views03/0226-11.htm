<p>While the official announcement wasn't a surprise to anyone working 
          at the network, MSNBC officially canceled the primetime show &quot;Donahue&quot; 
          on Tuesday, citing disappointing ratings.</p>
        <p>And in fact, if you look at the raw ratings numbers, the struggling 
          news channel may have a point. Originally conceived as a liberal alternative 
          to the popular O'Reilly Factor, the show started slow and never recovered. 
          During this month, a "sweeps" period in which ratings are watched closely 
          to set advertising rates, "Donahue" averaged 446,000 viewers. O'Reilly 
          drew 2.7 million viewers, up 28 percent from February 2002, according 
          to Nielsen Media Research. </p>
        <p>But as it turns out, the picture isn't as clear as it initially seems.</p>
        <p>While &quot;Donahue&quot; does badly trail both O'Reilly and CNN's 
          Connie Chung in the ratings, those numbers have improved in recent weeks. 
          So much so that the program is the top-rated show on MSNBC, beating 
          even the highly promoted &quot;Hardball With Chris Matthews.&quot;</p>
        <p>Although Donahue didn't know it at the time, his fate was sealed a 
          number of weeks ago after NBC News executives received the results of 
          a study commissioned to provide guidance on the future of the news channel.</p>
        <p>That report--shared with me by an NBC news insider--gives an excruciatingly 
          painful assessment of the channel and its programming. Some of recommendations, 
          such as dropping the &quot;America's News Channel,&quot; have already 
          been implemented. But the harshest criticism was leveled at Donahue, 
          whom the authors of the study described as &quot;a tired, left-wing 
          liberal out of touch with the current marketplace.&quot; </p>
        <p>The study went on to claim that Donahue presented a &quot;difficult 
          public face for NBC in a time of war......He seems to delight in presenting 
          guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's 
          motives.&quot; The report went on to outline a possible nightmare scenario 
          where the show becomes &quot;a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at 
          the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.&quot;</p>
        <p>A source close to Donahue claims that while he wasn't aware of the 
          specific study, the tone and outcome aren't surprising. </p>
        <p>&quot;It's not a coincidence that this decision comes the same week 
          that MSNBC announces its hired Dick Armey as a commentator and has both 
          Jesse Ventura and Michael Savage joining the network as hosts. They're 
          scared, and they decided to take the coward's road and slant towards 
          the conservative crowd that watch Fox News.&quot;</p>
        <p>While that assessment may be a bit harsh, it seems clear that MSNBC 
          has surrendered quicker than most recent Mike Tyson opponents. Rather 
          than building a unique voice, the news channel has opted to become a 
          lesser alternative to the Fox News Channel. And that decision was one 
          that even the NBC News study recommended against making. </p>
        <p>&quot;The temptation is to chase the audience that is already out there 
          and play to what seems to be working at Fox. But there is another road, 
          and if we build our unique voices from within, we have a chance to develop 
          a loyal and valuable audience.&quot;</p>
        <p>Well, I guess now we'll never know.</p>
