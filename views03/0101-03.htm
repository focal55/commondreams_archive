<p> The Defense Department's &quot;<a href="http://www.defendamerica.mil/" target="_new">Defend America&quot; Web site</a> reads, &quot;Dear member of 
    the U.S. military: Thank you for defending our freedom.&quot; Fill in your name 
    and hometown and click to join the more than 2 million who have sent the 
    message.

<p>
      The sentiment seems hard to argue with. No matter what one thinks of the 
      coming war against Iraq, can't we all send such a message to those who 
serve?</p>
    <p>
      Not if we want to be honest about U.S. war plans, for those troops won't 
      be defending our freedom but defending America's control over the 
      strategically crucial energy resources of the Middle East. They will be 
      in the service of the empire, fighting a war for the power and profits 
of the few, not freedom for the many.</p>
    <p>
      To some, that statement may seem disrespectful. But resistance to the 
      coming war against Iraq doesn't signal a lack of respect for those who 
      do the fighting. I never have served in the military, but my family and 
      friends have, and I have empathy for people on the front lines who face 
the risks.</p>
    <p>
      If I truly am to respect them &#8211; as human beings and as fellow citizens &#8211; 
I should be willing to state clearly my objections to this war.</p>
    <p>
      That requires distinguishing between the rhetoric and the reality of 
      U.S. foreign and military policy. Every great power claims noble motives 
      for its wars, but such claims usually cover an uglier reality, and we 
are no different.</p>
    <p>
      For most of the post-World War II era, the United States' use of force 
      against weaker nations was justified as necessary to stop Soviet plans 
      for world conquest. The Soviet regime was authoritarian, brutal and 
      interventionist in its own sphere, and it eventually acquired the 
capacity to destroy us with nuclear weapons.</p>
    <p>

      But the claim that the Soviets were a global military threat to our 
      existence also was a political weapon to frighten Americans into 
      endorsing wars to suppress independent development in the Third World 
and accepting a permanent wartime economy.</p>
    <p>
      With the Soviet Union gone, American planners needed a new justification 
      for the military machine. International terrorism may prove more durable 
      a rationale, for organizations such as al-Qaeda are a real threat, and 
we have a right to expect our government to take measures to protect us.</p>
    <p>
But the question is: Which measures are most effective?</p>
    <p>
      U.S. intelligence officials have acknowledged that the U.S. attack on 
      Afghanistan did little to reduce the threat and may have complicated 
      counterterrorism efforts. But the war was effective at justifying a 
      continuing U.S. military presence in Central Asia. A war against Iraq, 
      being marketed as part of the war on terrorism, is even more obviously 
about U.S. control of the region's oil.</p>
    <p>
      So, we have to separate what may motivate people in the armed forces 
from the real role of the U.S. military.</p>
    <p>
      I have no doubt that many of the people who serve believe they are 
      fighting for freedom, an honorable goal we should respect. But they are 
      doing that for a government with a different objective &#8211; to shore up 
      U.S. power and guarantee the profits of an elite &#8211; that we shouldn't 
support.</p>
    <p>
      There is no disrespect in urging fellow citizens who have joined the 
      military to ask, &quot;What am I really fighting for?&quot; and, &quot;Who really 
benefits from the risks I take?&quot;</p>
    <p>
      If we civilians truly care about the troops &#8211; as well as the innocent 
      people of Iraq who will die in a war &#8211; we should make it clear to 
      Washington that we won't support wars for power and instead demand a 
      sane foreign policy that seeks real freedom and justice, not dominance 
and control.</p>
    <p>
      My message to the troops would be: &quot;Thank you for being willing to 
defend freedom, but please join the resistance to this unjust war.&quot;</p>
    <p>
      That is a message of support for the troops and a plea for solidarity 
      among ordinary people who want to build a better world, not serve the 
empire.</p>
    <p>
      It is a reminder that, as John McCutcheon put it so eloquently in song: 
      &quot;The ones who call the shots won't be among the dead and lame/And on 
    each end of the rifle we're the same.&quot;</p>
