<p>Public space, universal community services and their historic traditions
which bind our nation together are all under assault. A Presidential 
Commission recommends that the U.S. Postal Service obtain commercial 
appraisals of their post offices and land with the view of selling the 
property off to help pay its expenses. The smaller postal services can 
find a place in a commercial mall to handle its "customers", advised 
this Bush-appointed Commission, dominated by corporate executives.

<p>The Government Printing Office (GPO), established by President Abraham 
Lincoln who named it "The People's Printer" to educate the public by 
providing all kinds of government documents, reports, and hearings at a 
very cheap price, just announced it is closing its 23 retail stores in 
major cities all over the country.

<p>Reason? A GPO spokesman, Andrew M. Sherman, said that their online 
operation is draining the retail end of its operations. Sales have 
dropped fifty percent. The GPO said they would save the princely sum of 
$1.5 million annually with all the closures.

<p>Aggressive real estate developers are eyeing public libraries and their 
urban branches with the aim of enveloping them under multi-use projects 
that include stores, cinemas and condos. In return, these tax sheltered 
developers will offer to pay for a portion or all of a new library 
structure.

<p>Is there anything wrong with these trends? Plenty, and they revolve 
around the difference between commercial and civic values right down to 
the neighborhood level.

<p>For over two centuries, free standing Post Office buildings have 
anchored communities of all sizes. In small towns and rural areas, it is
a vital force, a place to access all kinds of government information and
notices, a gathering spot to chat briefly and meet your friends and 
neighbors, a place to send and receive mail and parcels. This is 
something both tangibly and intangibly different than going to an 
enclave in a sprawling corporate Mall. People in small town-rural 
America see the Post Office as a symbol of Uncle Sam, of what the New 
York Times called "the national community." It is hard to imagine people
rallying to save the Postal enclave in a Mall, as they do to save their 
little Post Office.

<p>Budget-reduced public libraries are under increasing pressure to rebuild
their libraries under multi-use projects. City Hall sees multi-use as 
relieving its library budget. And the federal government can continue to
spend more every 48 hours in Iraq than its entire support of libraries 
in America over one year.

<p>Again, the loss of free-standing library structures and their 
landscaping means families and individuals entering and leaving 
libraries must navigate between people with shopping bags and carts 
negotiating adjacent stores, parking, and all the noise. Commercial minds do not appreciate the sanctuaries of such public 
institutions. They do understand dependency, however, as well as the 
proverbial foot in the door toward privatization (better called 
corporatization).

<p>The Edison company which aspires to corporatize a goodly part of the 
$400 billion annual public school budget, has suggested that schools 
could be on floors of office buildings. What is so sacrosanct about a 
free-standing school-house, anyway, it argues?

<p>Then there are the GPO stores. Maybe if the GPO had a better sense of 
promoting the dazzling variety of fascinating and important government 
publications, it could have avoided these stores closures all together. 
To be sure, there needs to be some enabling changes in the GPO's 
statutory base; but was there any excuse for the GPO shredding 1500 of 
the historic Watergate prosecutor's report years ago instead of letting 
people know how to get this increasingly valuable historic document?

<p>Rather than discounting, or giving away its surplus reports, the GPO 
often shreds and gets a few pennies per pound for scrap paper.

<p>The GPO store in Denver was 29 years old. The manager, Kathleen Moss, 
said many of her patrons "are appalled that we're shutting down. A lot 
of people would still rather come in and see the books on the shelf." 
This is otherwise known as browsing with others, something some human 
beings might prefer to a computer screen.

<p>One patron of the store, who was looking for books on Gen. George 
Armstrong Custer, said: "they think everybody would rather have a 
computer in their lap than a book." All this to save $1.5 million 
dollars, instead of actually expanding its market.

<p>It is permissible to think that Abraham Lincoln would have disapproved.
