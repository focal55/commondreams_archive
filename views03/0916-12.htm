<p>Tomorrow is Citizenship Day. The day doesn't mean much anymore. It is hardly noted, let alone celebrated. The typical school calendar lists the slugger holidays -- Thanksgiving, Christmas, Labor Day -- and a few optional types -- Veterans, Presidents, Martin Luther King. But Citizenship Day might as well be Nesting Turtle Day or Take Your Inner Liberal Out of the Closet Day. It's probably just as true that the word <i>citizenship</i> doesn't mean much either outside of a few schoolhouse walls, where it means playing nice and recycling, which has as much to do with citizenship as knowing who won the 1952 World Series (the Yankees, of course).<p>That's a shame. Citizenship Day used to be a great occasion for remembering what this country is about, for honoring naturalized citizens and reminding native-born citizens of the great bargain they take for granted. Congress started the commemoration in 1940 as the somewhat clunky "I Am An American Day," to be held annually and in every city on the third Sunday in May. President Truman renamed it and moved it to September 17 to coincide with the day founders signed the Constitution in 1787. For a while it took on the characteristics of early July 4 celebrations, when statesmen used the occasion to deliver great and sometimes bitterly partisan orations about the meaning of America. New York City set its celebrations in Central Park and combined them with naturalization ceremonies for thousands. But the big gatherings didn't outlast World War II, after which immigration was severely restricted for two decades. By the time a 1965 law opened the gates again, tales of napalm, riots and assassinations made prideful celebrations difficult. The day's purpose was lost.<p>These days the country doesn't take citizenship very seriously. To most Americans citizenship is something more akin to civility or patriotism than civic engagement: Most of us don't vote. Most of us would rather get our teeth cleaned than serve on a jury. Freedom of speech for the average American "is simply the freedom to repeat what everyone else is saying and no more" (as Gore Vidal put it). Dissent, as the mob mentality of the last two years continues to prove, is considered unpatriotic. Yet the nation's most politically fertile period -- the founding years between the drafting of the Constitution and the Jefferson presidency -- was also among its least civil. Bill Clinton would have felt at one with George Washington when a newspaper published by Ben Franklin's grandson declared on Washington's leaving office that "if ever a nation was debauched by a man, the American nation has been by Washington." The nation wasn't less well served by those differences. They reflected a passion for ideas, for the <i>purpose</i> of citizenship in a free nation. There's plenty of flag-waving and name-calling today. But the substance behind it is runny.<p>Expectations of citizenship are set low at the front door. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has been devoured by the Department of Homeland Security and spit back out as various "bureaus" with business-like responsibilities. Applicants for citizenship must pass a civics test. But they're given the 100 questions <i>and the answers</i> from which they'll be asked just 10 at test-time. They need answer no more than six correctly. Sample questions: "What are the colors of our flag?" "How many states are there in the Union?" A few questions can get a bit more interesting, even subjective -- "What is the basic belief of the Declaration of Independence?" "Name three rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights." But the sad thing isn't the simplicity of the questions, or their general irrelevance so far as the duties of citizenship are concerned. It's that immigrants are likelier to get them right than native-born citizens.<p>At my naturalization almost two decades ago I wouldn't have minded being required to learn by heart parts of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution or the Gettysburg Address, and made to explain them in their context <i>and</i> today's. Or made to recite parts of those speeches delivered on Citizenship Day many years ago. The greatest one was Judge Learned Hand's in Central Park on May 21, 1944. "What then is the spirit of liberty?" he asked, posing the most central question of American citizenship, and answering it as justly as it has ever been answered: "I cannot define it; I can only tell you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the mind of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest."<p>Learned Hand didn't mean heaven. He wasn't even certain what he meant. But "the spirit of that America which lies hidden in some form in the aspirations of us all" was a clue.<p><i>Tristam is a News-Journal editorial writer.
