<p>Lying about his sexual dalliances was not Bill Clinton's great crime. Even the Talmud includes sex among the three things one may lie about (one's erudition and the quality of someone else's hospitality are the other two). Better spare a spouse or a child -- or a nation -- the embarrassment of scurrilous but private misdeeds than publicly own up to a truth that's none of the public's business. The walls of the White House could speak of enough scurrilous "misdeeds" to make a Times Square wall blush, and not just because of Kennedy groupies. Half of South Dakota's Black Hills would have to be carved out if Mount Rushmore were devoted to our philanderers-in-chief.<p>Clinton's crime was to have misjudged the times. He failed to detect a political establishment high on what Philip Roth so aptly termed "the ecstasy of sanctimony." <i>That</i> was a failure of leadership far greater than his bush-league misdeeds, because it gave way to Ken Starr's fixation on the president's libido and a right-wing cabal more interested in destroying a presidency than in serving the public interest. In that sense, Clinton and his detractors co-dependently reduced the world's most powerful government into a vaudeville act. It was no joke. For two years the national agenda shifted from a world of crises and emerging dangers, including al-Qaida's rise and the economy's coming free-fall, to an obsession with Monica Lewinsky. The world became a more dangerous place because Washington wouldn't look past the president's crotch.<p>Ancient history? In names only. Today, Saddam is President Bush's Lewinsky.<p>It is an obsession as scabrous as the original, but with hugely worse consequences. The president isn't being harebrained. He isn't misguidedly dragging the nation through the muck of private thrills gone wrong. He is purposefully letting a private obsession rooted in his father's unsettled scores turn into an international game of chicken. He is about to drag the United States and Iraq through the most violent and costliest conflagration, potentially, since Vietnam in lives, money and good will. He is about to unsettle every government from North Africa to East Asia. And he's digging rifts through every community of nations that helped keep the peace since World War II (NATO, the United Nations, the European Union).<p>He's doing all this not because of Sept. 11 terrorism, al-Qaida's ties to Iraq being nil, not because of any credible threat Iraq poses to its neighbors or the world's oil supplies, and least of all to the United States. He's doing it because he has a score to settle and because he has discovered himself to be incapable of governing as a peacetime president. He made it clear to his National Security Council within weeks of the 2001 attacks, as Bob Woodward's last book, "Bush at War," indicated. A war against Iraq had to be high on the priority list, if only to keep the American public's interest in the greater war on terror from flagging. Never mind that there was no link between the two. From his Texas-size magic bag of evildoers, Bush would provide the link if his aides provided the war. And so they have.<p>As with the original Lewinsky, even the president's detractors are abetting his obsession. There is no war opposition to speak of in Congress. Sens. Robert C. Byrd, Bob Graham and a couple of others tried. But three and a half speeches on C-SPAN don't make an opposition. Democrats beat a retreat from <i>any</i> organized opposition in 2001 and never returned. Only six members of Congress are suing Bush over his end-run around the constitutional requirement that only Congress can declare war. Which is to say that 528 members don't take one of the Constitution's gravest provisions, or themselves, seriously. Eunuchs usually don't.<p>The chasm between Bush and his abettors gaped last weekend as millions of marchers at home and abroad voiced opposition to war. The signs from England to New Zealand were telling, and once again -- as in the aftermath of Sept. 11 -- revealed a deep empathy with Americans. There is no anti-Americanism to speak of in Paris any more than in New York or Daytona Beach. There is only anti-Bushism (or anti-<i>boucherie</i>, as the French pointedly punned on their translation for "butchery"). There is a refusal to go along with one man's obsession.<p>When the Lewinsky affair broke mid-way through Clinton's second term, the world wasn't exactly in crisis. Kosovo and the East Asian currency crisis aside, the planet seemed OK for a change. The Lewinsky obsession only deepened the delusion that nothing else of great importance needed attention. After 2001 Bush had no such excuse, and in 2003 even less. The United States is threatened by a worldwide terror network. Osama bin Laden is still happily at large. Al-Qaida's dalliances with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, those Bush administration "friends," don't even bother with covertness. North Korea is rattling nuclear-tipped sabers. Anti-Bushism is at an all-time high. Bush's domestic popularity, after its NASDAQ-like bubble of 2001, is paralleling the sputter-coughs of the economy. Deficits are out of control again, and the nation's health care system is as good as a daily human right abuse for millions. But Bush persists in courting his Babylonian Lewinsky and dragging us all through the muck.<p>The stain, this time, will be bloody, and the consequences won't end with a book deal. They'll be brutish and enduring.<p><i>Tristam is a News-Journal editorial writer. Reach him at <a href="mailto:ptristam@att.net">ptristam@att.net</a>.</i></p>
