<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures by desperate people. Because of that, I've decided to make the supreme sacrifice for my country and run for president in 2004. 

<p>Some might question my qualifications. While it's true I'm nowhere near as bright as Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton, I can with ease become as bland as Ronald Reagan, as unprincipled as the first George Bush or as treacherous and mentally unstable as the current George Bush. 

<p>No, I take that back. Even at my worst moments, and I've had a few, I could never be as treacherous as George W. Bush. 

<p>In any case, I qualify for the job. So do you, if you are American born, at least 35 years old, have a measurable IQ, can talk out of both sides of your mouth and have been sober for five minutes. 

<p>I'll be running for president under the auspices of the Utopian Party, which I founded about 30 seconds ago, after long and prayerful consideration. We Utopians (known derogatorily as Gardeners of Eden) believe that a better America can be created simply by electing politicians who love America more than they love power and money. I qualify. 

<p>So now, with fond memories of the late Earl of Asti and Sage of Sonoma, the man who could have done it incomparably better -- Pat Paulsen -- I present a few representative planks from the Utopian Party platform ... 

<p>Minimum wage: We Utopians believe the minimum wage should be a "living wage," enough money for a single person with a decent car to survive in a one-bedroom apartment in his or her community. It would vary from place to place depending on each place's cost of living, and it would include all classes of workers, including farm workers. 

<p>A "living wage" is, of course, a pro-business measure. Higher pay for workers means greater tax deductions for employers, and more customers for all businesses. Imagine a society in which everyone can afford to eat out, leave town on vacations and fly on airplanes! 

<p>If a businessperson cannot afford to pay a living wage, he or she has no business being in business. There's a principle involved here: the abolishment of slavery. We Utopians don't believe in virtual slavery any more than we believe in actual slavery. 

<p>Health care: Health care, like national defense, water systems, fire protection and police protection, is too important to be left up to money-grubbing individuals and corporations, who by their very nature will always charge as much as possible while providing as little as possible. 

<p>Our government should follow the example of other governments in Western industrialized countries, and take over our nation's health-care system. 

<p>This would mean, among other things, that neither you nor your employer would ever have to pay another dime to a for-profit health-insurance corporation. It would also mean, if done right, that 90 percent of the paperwork now required by health providers could be done away with, creating an immense savings in the cost of health care. 

<p>Taxes would have to go up to pay for this, of course, but because of no more health-insurance premiums, most workers and employers would probably come out ahead. 

<p>A better system for less money! We'd have it now if the insurance companies weren't so successful at bribing politicians and conning the public. 

<p>Auto insurance: Imagine a world in which you never had to pay a huge car-insurance premium! If the cost of insurance was added to the cost of gasoline (the "pay at the pump" system), the people who drive the most and have the least fuel-efficient cars would pay the most, as they should. (Allowances would have to be made for some commercial drivers, who would be paying far too much under this system. It could be worked out.) 

<p>Bad drivers -- those with at-fault accidents or traffic tickets on their records -- could be required to pay more. A system for that would have to be devised. It could be done. 

<p>Pay-at-the-pump has the advantage of getting all drivers into the system, thus lowering the cost of insurance for responsible individuals while raising it for those who don't carry insurance. And it would end discrimination against young people, who are assumed to be bad drivers because they're members of a high-accident group. 

<p>Education: We Utopians would, if we could, abolish private schools. Nothing would improve public education quicker than forcing the movers and shakers of our society to send their kids to public schools. But that idea would never wash. 

<p>More practically, we should abolish the U.S. Department of Education and return control of schools back to the counties. Nationalizing education was a bad idea to begin with. Our schools are no better now than they were before that department was created in 1979. We just pay more for them. 

<p>We also should abolish busing for racial-integration purposes. It's a waste of money and destroys the fabric of neighborhoods (which are usually held together by children). If we want black children to attend "white" schools, we should help willing black families move into "white" neighborhoods. 

<p>And vice versa. That would be real integration, not the artificial kind we have now. Which brings us to ... 

<p>Race relations: When it comes to colleges and universities, affirmative action would not be an issue if we had enough classrooms for all qualified students in our "better" schools. 

<p>We waste a lot of time and energy trying to decide what color students to admit to, say, UC Berkeley, when the real issue is that the university isn't big enough for all who want to attend. 

<p>Why not enlarge it, or build a comparable university nearby? Why should any qualified student be left out? 

<p>And what is this about legacies, the policy of giving special consideration to applicants whose parents graduated from the university? 

<p>Frankly, I never heard of legacies until a few years ago, and I'm still stunned to know they exist. Of all the un-American ideas I've ever heard of, legacy preference wins the prize. It smacks of royalty and hereditary privilege. Americans rejected the concept of royalty in 1776. In 2004, we should abolish the legacy system. Its existence in public institutions like Berkeley is an embarrassment in a democracy. 

<p>Homeland security: We Utopians who lived through World War II detest the word "homeland." It smacks of totalitarian propaganda, like the Nazi Fatherland or the Soviets' Mother Russia. We would stop using that word, and we'd abolish the new Department of Homeland Security, which is sure to evolve into a national police force. 

<p>We would, of course, do what we could to protect our nation, but we recognize the futility of trying to completely insulate ourselves from all dangers. We abhor the silliness of trying to protect our bridges, for instance, by parking California Highway Patrol officers at the ends of the bridges. Suicide bombers are not deterred by the threat of capture. 

<p>National defense: We Utopians believe America is in a position, because of its size and strength and traditional idealism, to lead the world by encouraging international cooperation. We prefer brains to bombs. We acknowledge that war as an instrument of defense may sometimes be necessary, but we also see war as the failure of diplomacy. 

<p>We Utopians would work hard to restore the international dignity and respect our nation has lost in the last two years. 

<p>So, if you see my name on the ballot next year, vote for me and the Utopian Party. If you don't see my name, well, heck, vote for somebody else -- as long as his name isn't Bush.
