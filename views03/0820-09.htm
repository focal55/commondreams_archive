<p>DON'T THINK for one second that Alabama Chief Justice Roy S. Moore doesn't know he's got a hot hand with his campaign to keep a 21/2 ton granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery. Justice Moore claims with a straight face that his refusal to obey a federal court order to remove the monument is all about Alabama's "right to acknowledge God." But he knows better, just as does anyone else who has followed his controversial public career. Roy Moore has been riding the Ten Commandments as a campaign issue since he first struck out for judicial office. And left to his own devices, he intends to ride the Decalogue as far as his appeals to emotions and lust for power will take him.

<p>Mr. Moore managed to get his name on the map -- and his face in the news -- when he was an Alabama circuit court judge. He took the decidedly un-judicial route of defying a court order to remove a hand-carved, wooden plaque of the Ten Commandments from behind the bench in his courtroom. Flushed with the attention and acclaim he won for that stunt and depicting himself as the "Ten Commandments Judge" and a defender of Alabama against moral decline, Mr. Moore advanced his political career in 2000 by winning an election for the chief justice post. And shortly after he settled in at the state courthouse -- and in the dead of night after his fellow justices had left the building -- Mr. Moore had the granite monument installed in the rotunda, with the entire episode recorded on film by an evangelical Christian media organization. That the organization, Coral Ridge Ministries, has used the proceeds from the sale of the film to pay Mr. Moore's legal expenses tells a story in itself about the extent to which he would exploit the Ten Commandments for his personal ends. Mr. Moore's decision to deliberately link his theology to the justice dispensed by the Alabama judiciary, to thumb his nose at the First Amendment prohibition against state establishment of religion, and then to go before an Alabama crowd of thousands and tell them that he will continue to defy a federal court order, recalls the worst days of Alabama Gov. George Wallace's defiance of federal desegregation decrees and is an affront to the rule of law.

<p>U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson, who ordered the monument removed from the judicial building by today because it violates the Constitution, has indicated that $5,000 daily fines could be imposed against Alabama if the order is not carried out by the deadline. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta has upheld Judge Thompson's ruling, and Alabama Attorney General William H. Pryor Jr. -- President Bush's nominee for a seat on the 11th Circuit -- has said he would "exercise any authority provided" to bring the state into compliance with the federal court order, adding, "I will not violate nor assist any person in the violation of this injunction." For any law-abiding judge, that should be enough, especially when the state's chief law enforcement officer, and a conservative himself, refuses to come to the judge's defense. But this is Roy Moore, who now has evangelist Jerry Falwell and other religious conservatives whipping up the crowd in his behalf.

<p>So what if deficit-ridden Alabama can hardly afford a $5,000 daily fine, or that Roy Moore believes he has sole discretion to decide which federal court orders to obey? There's nothing quite as intoxicating as having the power to stir up and win over people for one's own political ends, even at the expense of law and the Constitution.
