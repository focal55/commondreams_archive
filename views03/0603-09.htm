WASHINGTON -- A fraction of humanity enjoys unprecedented wealth and opportunity, while billions live brief, afflicted lives of unremitting toil for meager rewards. Yet surprisingly modest investments could break the vicious circle of poverty, disease, violence and environmental decline that is destabilizing the planet. Countries that spend huge amounts of arms should realize that their best defense lies in investing instead in health, education, environmental protection and innovative industries.

      <p>Consider these examples:

<p>Infectious illnesses kill 14 million mostly poor people worldwide each year, twice as many as cancer. Africa and Southeast Asia have 36 percent of the global population but account for 75 percent of deaths from communicable diseases that strike many people in their early or prime years of life. AIDS, for instance, has taken parents from more than 13 million children, unravelling the economic and social fabric of societies as it does so.

<p>Environmental degradation is exacerbating poverty and undermining global stability. Land clearing, deforestation, and climate change contribute to weather-related disasters that are most catastrophic for the poorest.

<p>As many as 35 million people have been driven from their homes by conflict and repression, and at least 25 million are environmental refugees. A quarter of the world's 50 wars and armed conflicts in recent years have involved a struggle for control of natural resources, while other hostilities have emerged from scarcity caused by overuse and depletion of resources.

<p>Yet the elimination of starvation and malnutrition would cost only about $19 billion annually; the prevention of soil erosion, $24 billion; reproductive health care for all women, $12 billion; clean drinking water, $10 billion; and the eradication of illiteracy, $5 billion. That amounts to $70 billion - just a fraction of the more than $830 billion spent on arms each year.

<p>An unconventional defense strategy would scale up existing initiatives to improve health, education and the environment, such as the programs that have made access to AIDS treatment more equitable in Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica, Panama and Botswana.

<p>Governments could also get behind industries that create jobs with less pollution and waste generation. Wind turbines, for example, provide clean electrical power to a growing number of people. Global wind-generated capacity has tripled since 1998 and remains the fastest-growing power source.

<p>Stability in the developing world also hinges on shoring up embattled agricultural systems. Subsidized food from industrial nations undermines farmers in poorer nations. Money should be spent instead on protecting croplands from erosion, supporting efficient irrigation water use and devising ways to ensure adequate farm incomes.

<p>Every war is meant to be the last. But while concerns about health, education and the environment recede in wartime, social and environmental progress is not a luxury that can be set aside without far-reaching consequences. Unalleviated hardship - and the frustration, despair and anger it can breed - will lead to another "last" war, and another, for many tomorrows to come.
