<p>With the chicken hawk-driven war on Iraq in high gear, Bush and Cheney 
have learned that the best way to silence the Democratic Party, distract
from their miserable domestic outrages and provide the corporate and 
rich classes with favors is to envelop our nation in fear. Using false or distorted statements, contrary to the findings of U.S. 
intelligence agencies, to exaggerate Iraqi threats, weapons and 
terrorist (al-Qaeda) connections as reasons for the war, their invasion 
and prolonged occupation may produce greater risks of stateless 
terrorism in the U.S. Last fall, the CIA informed Congress of just this 
higher probability resulting from an Iraqi invasion.
Watching reports describing our draft-dodging President as totally 
immersed in the scope and details of his Iraqi invasion, a number of 
puzzling questions arise:
<p>1.) Why is Bush pouring half of the entire U.S. military at huge cost 
into the Persian Gulf while rejecting the frantic requests by cities and
states (such as New York City) for overdue monies for homeland security?
<p>2.) What will Bush say to Americans if no weaponized nuclear, chemical 
or biological materials are found in Iraq or, if found, not used, as 60 
Minutes World War II vet Andy Rooney believes we ourselves would use if 
a powerful foreign invasion was overwhelming our country? The CIA told 
Bush that Saddam would be more likely to use these chemical and 
biological weapons if the U.S. invades.
<p>3.) With domestic necessities of the American people being ignored, why 
is Bush pushing Congress for yet another huge tax cut for the wealthy 
while Alan Greenspan is warning about larger budget deficits this year 
and afterwards?
<p>4.) Albeit surrounded by his little clique of ideologues, why has Bush 
refused requests to meet from any of thirteen major antiwar groups 
representing tens of millions of Americans? They include labor, 
business, clergy, human rights, war veterans, academics with national 
security experience, physicians and elected city officials who have much
to inform him. Some have battle experience in the Gulf and know about 
toxic exposures to our troops. Others have returned from Iraq with first
hand knowledge about conditions. Still others are steeped in the 
boomerang effect of ill-advised belligerence and distraction from more 
serious global conflicts and struggles against sabotage.
Tony Blair in London received for nearly an hour a delegation from the 
National Council of Churches headed by former Congressman Bob Edgar. Yet
the Council leaders have been rejected by their own President for the 
past year. There is the cause and effect of history that Bush needs to 
know about in the Middle East. Maybe he would not have used the word 
"crusade" or have invoked God's will and his divine guidance regarding 
overthrowing Saddam. Such references are viewed in Islamic societies as 
meaning a religious war.
<p>But Bush does not seek any advice, information or insights from these 
informed Americans. He ignored all their written requests (see 
  <a href="http://www.essentialaction.org" target="_new">www.essentialaction.org</a>).
<p>5.) Immersed in Iraq, Bush pays little attention to America. He is 
spending far more time on the Middle East, and destructively so, than on
the manufacturing decline of the Middle West. And he wants to cut 
veterans benefits. His unchallenged domination of the mass media leaves 
little space for others to raise these issues.
<p>Heard about opportunity cost (or opportunities lost) of his 
Messianicmilitarism lately? No attention to a long frozen minimum wage, 
worsening poverty, skyrocketing drug prices along with soaring consumer 
bills for oil and natural gas. Heard about advances needed for energy 
efficiency and solar power and less gas guzzling motor vehicles? Bush 
has put America on hold!
<p>6.) What is a weapon of mass destruction anyhow? Ask Iraqi families 
whether or not Bush has sent weapons of mass destruction from the air, 
from the sea and on land, to smash their country and destroy tens of 
thousands of lives in order to topple one man. Haven't the economic 
sanctions blocking medicines, surgical materials and sanitation 
purifiers for clean drinking water taken the lives of enough Iraqi 
children over a decade? Deliberately making civilians suffer for a 
military overthrow of a dictator happens to be a violation of 
international law.
<p>7.) Why did know-it-all Bush, who ironically brags about making 
decisions from his gut, stifle dissent from his war policy and its 
likely aftermath that still simmers at sub-cabinet levels inside the 
Pentagon, the CIA and the State Department? Leading retired Generals, 
Admirals, diplomats and national security officials tried to articulate 
the same criticism publicly over the past few months.
<p>8.) Except for the oil and munitions industries, the war is a downer on 
the economy. A few business executives have spoken up strongly. Most are
not prone to speak publicly for fear of retaliation by the Bush 
Administration which, in this area, is believed to be vindictive against
corporate dissenters.
<p>From the big Geneva Switzerland auto show last month, Automotive News' 
executive editor, Peter Brown of Detroit, talked to many European auto 
executives. He writes: "Personally, most of the executives oppose the 
war as unnecessary and likely to lead to greater terrorism and 
instability." This is pretty much the judgment of most of the U.S. 
foreign policy establishmentwhose prominent ex-government officials are 
also being ignored by the all-knowing, instinct-driven President.
