<p>Here, from two California observers familiar with the strangeness that passes 
for politics in this state, is our preliminary analysis of the recall 
imbroglio.

<p>Many in the media are focusing on the farcical nature of the proceedings -- 
and there is much about it that is absurdly comical -- but, at heart, this is 
deadly serious politics. 
<p>(Note: This story is unfolding so rapidly that aspects 
of what we write today are likely to seem dated by the time you read it.)

<p>The first thing to recognize is that this is not merely a California story. 
We don't mean that what's happening in the Golden State is being repeated 
elsewhere --  although given how many states are being bankrupted by the poor 
national economy (44 are now in serious financial difficulty) and that the feds 
aren't helping lift the states from their financial pits, that is true to some 
extent.

<p>No, what we're referring to is that the political impetus for the recall 
apparently did not arise from California, but rather from Washington, D.C., and, 
even more specifically, from the White House. (See cited sources, below).


<p>What seems to be occurring is that the rightwing forces controlling the 
Republican Party want TOTAL victory, and not just for the upcoming 2004 election. 
They want to control the direction of the United States, both foreign and 
domestic, for the foreseeable future, for decades to come. (In the past 
two-and-a-half years, the country has received only the first taste of their extremist 
agenda: unilateral foreign adventurism, "pre-emptive" attacks on countries that 
are not imminent threats, the shredding of Constitutional guarantees of due 
process, the stealth moves to decimate and eliminate popular social programs, 
huge tax breaks going to the wealthy and corporations, polluters given free 
rein, etc. etc.)

<p>To fully implement their agenda, these extremists believe that they must 
thoroughly neutralize all those who might put up a fight -- not simply to defeat 
them politically, but rather to effectively DESTROY them -- so that little 
organized opposition to Bush&Co. policies can get in the way of total control of 
the political/social/economic apparati in this country.


<p>GETTING THE DEMOCRATS

<p>One key institution that must be so weakened that it cannot offer effective 
resistance is the Democratic Party. Even though the Democrats are barely 
distinguishable from the Republicans on many issues, the power-hungry forces of 
Bush&Co. want to make sure that the Democrats are so scattered, debilitated and 
demoralized that their opposition will mean nothing when the Bush forces begin, 
after their projected 2004 victory, to roll over the political landscape. 
Accordingly, the Rove demolition team has taken aim at the primary sources of 
financial support to the Democratic Party: e.g., the teachers and public-service 
unions, and the trial lawyers.

<p>(This desire for total control reminds one of how the Watergate scandal 
started: All the polls indicated that Nixon was going to win a huge victory over 
his Democratic opponent, Sen. McGovern. But this wasn't enough for Nixon. He

felt that he had to insure his win by tapping the telephone of the DNC
chairman.)

<p>And so, in large state after large state, the Democratic party and its 
institutions are being attacked.

<p>* In Texas, on orders from Washington  -- read: Karl Rove (see below for how Bush's brain may well have accomplished this) and hatchetman Tom Delay --  
there is an illegal attempt to redistrict the Congressional delegation, so that 
the Democrats will lose their majority.

<p>* In Florida, and in the rest of the states moving to a computer-registration 
and voting system, the same forces that ensured a Bush victory in 2000 in the 
Sunshine State, are <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=222&row=" target="_new">hard at work to minimize the Democratic vote once again</a>. Remember that for the 2000 
election in Florida, about 94,000 Democratic voters, under the cover that they all 
were convicted felons, were removed electronically from the computerized 
polling lists and not permitted to vote, even though <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/2002/11/04_Palast.html" target="_new">91,000 of those names were 
there by mistake</a>. Of 
course, this outrageous act alone sufficed to yield Florida, and eventually the 
White House, to Bush.  

<p>* In California, a governor elected in a fair vote just nine months ago is 
now subject to recall and replacement, even though he has done nothing criminal 
or outrageous that would warrant such an extreme move.

<p>In short, what is going on here is an attempt to get these large, electoral 
vote-rich states into the Bush column for 2004 and to the GOP beyond.

<p>* And we haven't even gone into detail about the computer-voting scandal, 
which may well have led to a number of other large states, such as Georgia, going 
into the Republican column in the 2002 election, thus giving control of the 
U.S. Senate to the Republicans.

<p>(See our <a href="http://www.crisispapers.org/topics/electoral-integrity.htm" target="_new">Electoral Integrity file</a> 
 for stories about how the three companies that make computer-voting 
machines -- one partially owned by a Republican senator, all three supporters 
of Republicans, at least one tied to a right-wing foundation -- refuse to 
permit examination of their software, which has been shown to be highly 
manipulable to vote-tampering, without leaving any evidence of having been altered. In 
Georgia, for example, Democratic war-hero incumbent Senator Max Cleland was 
ahead in the polls right up to the election, and surprisingly lost by a 
significant percentage; similar oddities occurred in five other states where

computer-voting screens were employed. And no one has fully explained why exit-polling, 
the most accurate predictor of election results, was suddenly cancelled in 
the 2002 election, just as the polls were closing.

<p>OVERTURNING ELECTIONS

<p>What is happening is a persistent attempt to overturn the outcomes of 
previous elections by using dirty tricks and changing the rules in midstream.

<p>In Texas, as <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/startelegram/news/columnists/molly_ivins/6443268.htm" target="_new">Molly Ivins writes</a>, 
 the 
Republicans want to alter the partisan makeup  of the Texas Congressional 
delegation -- from Democatic majority over to Republican -- even though this

would be in violation of the redistricting laws. In California, even though the 
governor was elected fair and square in November, the GOP is using an arcane


1911 recall law, to oust him and install one of their own in his  place. (The 
California population is angered by the failing state economy and by the way the 
energy companies, led by Enron, manipulated prices -- and have been encouraged 
to take out their frustrations on the one public figure everyone can see each 
day, the governor.)

<p>So, in all the hoopla about Arnold Schwarzenegger and the 200+ other 
candidates running, Rove and friends back in Washington, D.C. must be chortling with 
glee. The focus of national media attention has shifted from Bush's crimes, 
lies and failures to Hollyweird on the Left Coast.

<p>Even if Davis manages to hang on to his job -- the strong union movement in 
the state is mobilizing, Schwarzenegger has many vulnerabilities, etc. -- the 
recall might be partially successful for the GOP: The Democrats would have had 
to spend millions of dollars that would otherwise have been been reserved for 
the 2004 general election. And if Davis is taken down, California -- which 
normally votes overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections -- is put back 
into play, forcing the Democrats to divert precious resources from elsewhere

in the country to fight Bush in the Golden State. (Of course, this assumes 
that Bush will be the GOP nominee in 2004 and not in the impeachment well of the 
Senate.)

<p>DEFEATING THE RECALL 

<p>The bottom line: What Democrats and Independents need to concentrate on is 
the defeat of the California recall. 

<p>If Davis can somehow cut through the media mayhem to the issue of fairness, 
he could have a chance. That is: Davis was elected, in a fair election, nine

months ago, defeating a Bush Republican soundly, with the issues now being used 
against him pubicly debated at the time; since the governor hasn't done 
anything in the interim to warrant recall, it isn't fair, or even sporting, to try 
to overturn the will of the voters. In our democracy, we have a way of getting 
rid of politicians we no longer choose to support: We vote them out in the 
next election.

<p>Davis is no great shakes as a governor, and certainly is not a charismatic 
personality. But he's competent, and has found himself in a terrible position 
largely because of the economy -- some of that was the dot-com bust, but a 
significant part is a result of Bush's disastrous economic and tax-cut/war policies 
-- and by the way Enron and the other energy companies criminally manipulated 
the  prices to rake in huge profits. (Speaking of Enron, has Bush's mentor 
and financial supporter, Kenny Lay, been indicted yet? Just asking.)

<p>It's helpful to remember that a good share of the State Legislature 
contributed to the state's current woes: They voted for the deregulation of the energy 
system in the state, and they failed to react in time to the dot-com bubble 
bursting. Furthermore, in the current budget crisis, the GOP legislators 
steadfastly refused any tax increases to offset the fiscal shortfall. (In California, 
a 2/3 vote is required to raise taxes). Since attempting to recall all of 
those legislators is out of the question, Davis has become, thanks to the 
GOP-initiated recall process, the target.

<p>If enough voters are able to discern that the issue is overturning a 
free-and-fair election, and not whether they like or don't like Davis, the Rove/GOP 
plan will falter in the face of united Democratic/moderate-Republican 
opposition. The Texas Democrats are refusing to cooperate with the Rove/Delay scheme in 
that state, having made sure a quorum can't be called. The computer-voting 
scandal finally is making its way into the mainstream media, and suits are being 
filed.

<p>IS YOUR STATE NEXT? 

<p>In short, the opposition is starting to stand up and be counted. We must do 
everything possible here in California, and across the country, to roll huge

boulders into the path of the Bush&Co. juggernaut that is seeking total control. 
We've seen the disasters, foreign and domestic, that have taken place during

the past two-and-a-half years since Bush's selection to office. That will look 
like a friendly tea-party if Bush&Co. are given free rein after 2004.

<p>For we must never forget or discount these simple and apparent facts: The 
HardRight is profoundly anti-democratic. According to demagogues such as Rush 
Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, liberals and Democrats are not merely The Loyal 
Opposition to be defeated in fair and honest political debates and elections. 
Instead, they say, liberals and Democrats are "traitors" deserving elimination. When 
the will of the people, in fair elections, results in victory for the 
Democrats, those decisions must be undone, either by impeachment (Clinton) or recall 
(Davis). Language is to be used without scruple as a political weapon, along

lines envisioned by George Orwell: "freedom is slavery," "war is peace." Dogma 
trumps science, evidence, practical experience, and even civic morality. The

ends justify the means, even if the means includes gross lying to the public. 
Compromise displays weakness. There is no middle ground. "You are either with us 
or against us."

<p>These are the politics of fascism, and we are moving relentlessly in that 
dreadful direction. Unless, at last, true American patriots with sufficient 
voices draw the line and say: "This far, and no further." And then proceed to 
reclaim our Constitution, our rights, and our republic.

<p>Will the California recall election be that line? There are less than 60 days 
until the vote (unless a courageous federal judge enjoins the recall). We 
Californians have work to do. To those beyond our borders, we urge you not to 
stand idly by. This is your fight too. You could be next. Be vigilant.

<a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/analysis/03/08/08_recall.html" target="_new">Evidence
 from BuzzFlash</a>. 
<p>In chronological order:

<p>KARL ROVE: POSSIBILITY OF A GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER "WOULD BE REALLY, REALLY

NICE." "With Mr. Rove's blessing," Bush political advisers met with 
Schwarzenegger in 2001 about the prospect of Schwarzenegger running for CA governor in  
2002. The New York Times reported on the meeting: "That would be nice," Mr. 
Rove said of the prospect of a Governor Schwarzenegger. "That would be really 
nice. That would be really, really nice." [New York Times, 4/15/01]

<p>BUSH GURU KARL ROVE MET WITH SCHWARZENEGGER IN APRIL. Schwarzenegger visited

the White House for a meeting with top Bush adviser Karl Rove on April 12th,

2003. Both Schwarzenegger and Rove claimed that politics was not discussed  
during the meeting. [Washington Post, 4/13/03]

<p>LAURA BUSH'S PRESS SECRETARY HELPED GOP CANDIDATE STRATEGIZE FOR RECALL 

CAMPAIGN. Noelia Rodriguez, Laura Bush's press secretary and former LA deputy 
mayor, was in Los Angeles for a week in July helping former mayor Richard Riordan 
assemble a campaign team and strategy for a possible run on the recall ballot. 
[ Los Angeles Times, 7/31/03; New York Times, 8/1/03]

<p>TOP BUSH CA. ADVISER PLAYING MAJOR ROLE IN RECALL. Gerry Parsky, Bush's top 
adviser in California, has been advising GOP candidates on the recall strategy. 
The Sacramento Bee reported, "Bush isn't staying entirely out of the 
election. His liaison in California, businessman Gerald Parsky, summoned  
representatives of potential Republican candidates to his office Tuesday to discuss how 
the  GOP could help recall Davis." [Sacramento Bee, 7/30/03]

<p>HIGH-LEVEL BUSH RE-ELECTION STRATEGIST INVOLVED IN RECALL EFFORT. Mindy 
Tucker, who served as a Bush spokesperson in the 2000 election and is currently a 
high-level Bush campaign strategist, is involved in the recall election 
strategy. A memo by a California GOP campaigner noted, "Mindy Tucker, former Bush 
campaign spokesperson and current Bush campaign operative in California, has the  
White House's blessing." The same memo noted that Tucker would be involved in 
 coordinating recall campaign events, and that "the resulting issue-oriented

and image-enhancing coverage will benefit the image of the Republican Party,

the  recall candidates, and will benefit President Bush as we remind the 
public of who is to blame for the mess in this state." [San Francisco Chronicle, 
8/6/03]

<p>TUCKER HAS DENIED WHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT, BUT ALLUDES TO BUSH STRATEGY. 
Tucker has claimed that her involvement is not on the part of the White House, but 
has also said, "the president has given everybody in California his blessing

to take a position on this." Tucker has also said, "We've identified some  
areas where the recall will help us build the party -- not only for the recall, 
but also for '04, which everyone believes is important." [San Francisco 
Chronicle , 8/6/03] #
