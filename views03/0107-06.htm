<p>ISTANBUL, Turkey -- In anticipation of a war against Iraq, the Turkish Doctors Union (Türk 
Tabipler Birligi), the professional association to which all doctors in Turkey 
belong, has recently announced measures to be taken in the event of a chemical 
or biological weapons attack. The first indicator of an attack is vapor in the 
air with an almond, garlic kind of odor. This is followed by the appearance of 
oil and water droplets in the surroundings. "Immediate headaches, coughing, 
watery eyes, visual defects, nausea, breathing difficulties and sudden bleeding 
are some of the major symptoms. Dead rats, flies, and insects may also indicate 
an attack" (See <a href="http://www.ttb.org.tr/savas/" target="_new">www.ttb.org.tr/savas/</a> and 'Turkish Daily News', Jan. 2, 03).

<p>No wonder that, according to recent polls, over 80% of the people here 
are saying "Savasa Hayir," No to War.
<p>Except by those who have traveled here, little is known of the socially 
impressive sensibility and liveliness of Turkish society, across all sectors, 
rich and poor, elite and marginal, conservative and dynamic. Certainly none of 
the military strategists on the 24 hour news channels in the United States 
who are busily calculating the "use of our bases in Turkey" and the 
"friendship" of Turkey as a "reliable ally" appreciate or know of the strollers 
in the marketplaces, parks, and malls (these days decorated with New Years 
Trees and Noel Babas, and playing host to sold out shows of "The Two Towers"). 
None of the strategists for "Showdown in Iraq," seem to care to consider the 
social context for the upcoming war, like the cosmopolitan diversity of the 
crowded, lively cafes here, where, even amidst the ongoing anguish of an
impoverishing economic crisis (since February, 2001), friends, families, and 
lovers gather for conversation, tea or one of the local spirits, games of 
backgammon, and, in the evenings, song and dance. None seem to have ever heard 
the playful sounds emanating from the yards of the elementary schools and 
soccer fields, or witnessed the busy scholarly arenas of the universities, or 
encountered the relatively trustful public atmosphere that one finds here in 
Istanbul, a city of over 12 million, in which passengers on commuter buses pass 
their fare hand to hand from where they sit to the driver (who sends the change 
back, hand to hand) and children play and travel more freely than they do in 
even the mid-size towns of the United States.
<p>And, yes, like the American administration, too few of the public  
strategists in the US appreciate the rationality of protest in the region 
against a war that seems to be more about projecting American power and control 
(over oil, but not only that) than "fighting terrorism." At least the National 
Alliance in Afghanistan was *already* at war with the Taliban. Here, among 
those who support helping the Americans, the calculation is more that the costs 
are too great to be left on the outside, and that, once in, Turkey should seize 
the opportunity to secure -- what the authorities consider -- the country's 
"national interests" (both economically and strategically, in northern Iraq). 
"There are too many reasons why we have to be in the action," Prime Minister 
Abdullah Gül recently told the editors of the major newspapers. 
<p>Yahoo!News reported the burning of American, British, and Israeli flags at 
a demonstration last week here, but it made no mention of the legitimate
worries and objections of tens of thousands of ordinary citizens and
non- Governmental Organizations like the Doctors, Bar, and Women's Associations, to 
this planned, US-led assault. As Turkish nationals and supporters of democracy, 
those "saying no" are hardly pro-Saddam. They are concerned for their own 
welfare and the safety of their neighbors in Iraq, and they ask for the 
consistent application of international law, region-wide weapons reductions 
plans, and comprehensive conflict resolution efforts. They object in principle 
to the impatient instrumental use of their country ("Turkish soil and ports," 
what to Americans are "our bases") and of their friends or relatives in the 
army for "America's war" (to quote one friend with such connections), and they 
are deeply troubled by the sense that something very, very nasty is about to 
happen here.
<p>Military calculations, like war itself, are much more easily made from 
afar, where the lives of those immediately affected and used -- including the 
American and allied troops who are poised to do their jobs -- remain remote.  
But if, despite the protests and pleas for restraint from those whose
well- being hangs in the balance, the US administration decides to launch a war, the 
battles are not going to be remote from Turkey, or Kuwait, Jordan, Syria, Saudi 
Arabia, and Iran, or even Baghdad. What preparations are being made by the 
administration, its allies in the region, and the UN Security Council to
protect the noncombatant doctors, lawyers, teachers, marketsellers, lovers and 
dancers, or the youngsters now playing computer games next to me from the 
effects of harmful gases and biological agents? US policy-makers took pride in 
the humanitarian efforts they made during the height of the war in Afghanistan 
(dollar donations from children; food relief efforts). Not only should they now 
listen to the reflective, non-belligerent voices of those directly affected -- 
for their objections to the current course of US policy will not disappear with 
Saddam. They should also, before deciding to launch a war, organize and take 
all necessary measures to protect the lives of all noncombatants in the region, 
here and in other countries (just as one sees in Washington, New York, and Tel 
Aviv), by distributing gas masks and home-protection kits, and by making
antidotes to weapons of mass destruction readily available. Economic and
political incentives for the local regimes to "join the coalition" are, 
emphatically, *not* enough. If all present efforts at a peaceful resolution 
fail, then, in Iraq too, the US must do more than simply try to avoid 
casualties; it should help people survive war.
<p>If a nasty war looms in the near future, the consequences of not 
addressing these needs will be, quite possibly, truly catastrophic. As 
indispensable as the informative services of the Turkish Doctors Union are, if 
and when the dead rats transform the lively arenas of life here into potential 
mass morgues, no one should be left without the resources they need to survive.
