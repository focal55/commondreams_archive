<p>There I was, reclined in the dentist's chair, cheek numbed, while two sets of able hands reworked an old filling. "Classic rock" radio drifted into my ears between the drill's whining. 

<P>It was during a break in the oral festivities that I heard a mellifluous, yet <I>very</I> manly, voice over a background of patriotic music. The essence of this "public service message" was, "No campus protester, no newspaper columnist, no politician fights for <I>your freedom</I>. Support the troops, damn it." 

<P>Half my face was numb, but my brain was not. Good for the troops, I thought, for routing the torturous, iron-fisted Iraqi regime. But as to whether they were defending <I>my</I> actual freedom, I had some doubts. 

<P>The owner of that radio station doesn't do doubt. Clear Channel Communications is an enormous radio/concert promotion conglomerate deeply enmeshed with the U.S. right wing. And since an ill-advised, 1996 deregulation of radio, Clear Channel has increased the number of stations it owns from 40 to a whopping 1,225 &#151; about 970 more than its closest competitor. 

<P>Clear Channel likes to tell us what to think and listen to. Besides telling helpless dental patients what to think, it was banning music by the Dixie Chicks from its stations because singer Natalie Maines had expressed "shame" at being from the same state as George W. Bush. In addition, Clear Channel organized pro-war demonstrations in cities across the nation. And just after Sept. 11, 2001, the company's programmers developed a list of "don't play" songs that might "offend" listeners, including (no, really) "Jet Airliner" by Steve Miller and "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen. 

<P>Big deal, you say? That's their right? Well, yes, but some of us &#151; including wingnut liberal William Safire &#151; think it's dangerous to let any company with a monolithic political viewpoint gobble up more and more media sources, and wield ever-increasing influence over play lists. 

<P>"It's a good thing to have a system that has Fox News on the air," says Harold Feld, associate director of the non-profit Media Access Project. "It's a bad thing if the only thing you have on the air is Fox News." 

<P>But despite the havoc wrought upon radio by Clear Channel, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell (Secretary of State Colin's son) is eager to further loosen restrictions on media conglomeration. Six rules are under consideration for change, including one limiting the number of local TV stations that any company can own and prohibitions of one media company, say, Disney/ABC, from owning another conglomerate such as Viacom/CBS. (For a detailed summary of the rules, go to <a href="http://www.mediaaccess.org" target="_new">www.mediaaccess.org</a>.) 

<P>Powell, a die-hard libertarian who thinks media concentration is just swell, needs only convince two of his colleagues on the commission (two Republicans, two Democrats) to undo or drastically alter those rules, paving the way for more Clear Channel-style debacles. A decision is anticipated in June. 

<P>I prefer a world of diverse viewpoints. It's part of my job, in fact, to publish opinions with which I strenuously disagree, and I do it with pride. 

<P>If you don't want monolithic viewpoints to dominate our airwaves &#151; which in reality belong to <I>us</I> &#151; send a comment to the FCC via <a href="http://www.FCC.gov" target="_new">www.FCC.gov</a>, and contact your congressional representatives to let them know how you feel.
