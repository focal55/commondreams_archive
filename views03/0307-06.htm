<p>Mr. President, do you see them? The signs of our time? </p>
<p>They're everywhere.</p>
<p>Draped over people's backs. Perched atop wooden sticks. Plastered on hand-held poster boards. </p>
<p>Written in chalk. Scrawled in marker. Lettered by strips of duct tape. </p>
<p>In Rome. In New York. Right here in Seattle.</p>
<p>They sound a warning trumpet -- beware the tides of a march to war.</p>
<p>"No Iraq War," read a blur of red-white-and-blue signs. They bobbed past me the other day in a sea of protesters that flushed into downtown Seattle.</p>
<p>Other signs read: "Peace is Patriotic"; "We Cannot Spread Democracy With Laser-Guided Bombs"; "Violence Isn't Reasoning."</p>
<p>Are the messages getting through, Mr. President?</p>
<p>Sign bearers want a way out of this Iraqi mess without an awful shed of red -- the blood of brave American military men and women who will take up arms for a dangerous cause.</p>
<p>There also is the blood of innocents in Iraq, who could lose their lives from our Saddam-seeking missiles.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the signs speak of doubt and show conflict within us.</p>
<p>"The World Sees Through It, Can We?" said a sign, written in blocky letters on cardboard. </p>
<p>"Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics," said another.</p>
<p>"It's About <b>L</b>iberat<b>IO</b>n, Stupid -- <b>OIL!</b>" screamed a sign, which sought to set the record straight on why our country really wants to go to war.</p>
<p>One sign asked: "Why Do His Reasons For War Keep Shifting?"</p>
<p>They are talking about you, Mr. President.</p>
<p>Some messages implore you to focus elsewhere: "War Is A Distraction. We Need Jobs And Healthcare"; "Regime Change Starts At Home"; "Books Not Bombs, By George!"; "Where's Osama?"</p>
<p>I have to admit some of what has been written is not very pretty:</p>
<p>"Bush = Hitler"; </p>
<p>"Preemptive War is An Oxymoron. George W. Bush is All Moron";</p>
<p>"Drop Bush, Not Bombs";</p>
<p>"Frodo Failed. Bush Has The Ring."</p>
<p>"Hey Bush! Quit Wiping Your Ashcroft With Our Constitution."</p>
<p>My apologies, Mr. President. </p>
<p>Some of those writers, flip and rude as they are, are simply frustrated and scared about what may lie ahead. Scared just like the rest of us. </p>
<p>They would say anything -- no matter how sharp -- in the faint hope that you hear the meaning behind their message. </p>
<p>But look closely. </p>
<p>Not all signs speak of disunity or criticize the military: "Support Our Troops. Not War" said one, followed by "Cure Gulf War Syndrome," after which came "Use Force of Law, Not Law of Force."</p>
<p>Some signs simply offered another perspective.</p>
<p>"We Can Bomb Iraq to Pieces But Not To Peace"; "War Doesn't Prove Who's Right -- Only Who's Left"; and "Why Wouldn't They Attack Our Cities If We Start It?"</p>
<p>Very good question.</p>
<p>Questions are why millions of people have been gathering in cities across the world in recent weeks, hoping and praying for other options, aside from violence, to get rid of an evil, violent man.</p>
<p>Saddam, you say, has weapons of mass destruction. He has conducted a "willful charade" of disarmament. There's truth in that.</p>
<p>However, your leadership, Mr. President, requires you to hear diametrically opposed voices.</p>
<p>People just want you to exhaust every possible effort before declaring war, even if that means pushing back the timetable a bit.</p>
<p>Public debate and an exchange of viewpoints are the hallmarks of democracy, yet many Americans and people elsewhere -- including France, Germany and Russia -- feel as if you are just giving them the royal White House brush-off.</p>
<p>They all can't be dumb, misguided or uninformed, can they?</p>
<p>Last night on national television you spoke to the world. You acknowledged the chasm between you and other world leaders about how best to deal with Saddam. </p>
<p>You summed it up as "a disagreement."</p>
<p>But Mr. President, did you know that if the presidential election were held today you would narrowly lose to a Democrat candidate? That's what one nationwide opinion poll -- by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute -- says.</p>
<p>People are that concerned about the economy and about the prospect of war. They have "a disagreement" with you. </p>
<p>Those signs are out there -- just like one, among the many at Westlake Plaza, that said "Bush Does Not Speak In My Name."</p>
<p>Mr. President, all you have to do is open your eyes. You would see the signs, too.</p>
