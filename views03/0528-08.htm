<p>Did anyone notice the uncanny similarities between the recent U.S.-led war 
in Iraq and Indonesia in its crackdown of Aceh?

<p>Last week, the peace agreement between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) 
and  Indonesian government collapsed and Indonesia's President Megawati 
Sukarnoputri imposed a state of martial law in the remote province, 
ordering tens of thousands of troops to militarily crush the guerrilla force.

<p>Indonesia's foreign minister Hassan Wirayuda, seems to see the connection 
between Aceh and Iraq, quoted by the BBC as saying "Honestly, what we are 
doing or will do in Aceh is much less than the American power that 
was  deployed in Iraq."

<p>A spokesman for Mr. Wirayuda said that "Iraq may cause some pause in 
criticism against us among governments who readily used force."

<p>The United States seems not to be making the connection between its actions 
and the military prerogatives of other countries. U.S. State Department 
spokesperson Richard Boucher indicated that both sides of the conflict in 
Indonesia had not explored every peaceful alternative at the Tokyo 
negotiations, seemingly oblivious to the U.S. policy of "do as I say, not 
as I do."

<p>Prior to the war in Iraq, the international community overwhelmingly 
supported dialogue and international weapons inspectors through the United 
Nations to root out any weapons of mass destruction that Iraq might have

been hiding. The United States preferred military action to negotiations, 
and against the better judgment of the United Nations and most allies, 
proceeded with the invasion.

<p>In Aceh, too, negotiations and dialogue had been underway through the Henry 
Dunant Center (HDC) which had brokered a peace deal that included a 
monitoring agency comprised of representatives from the Indonesian 
government, the Free Aceh Movement and the HDC. The United States and Japan 
had provided ample financial backing to the monitoring agency, called the 
Joint Security Committee, and have been invested in finding a non-military 
solution to the problem in Aceh.

<p>Indonesia has complete support from every country in the world for its 
sovereignty over Aceh. No secession is seriously at hand and the world was 
actively engaged in disarming the rebels and negotiating a solution. The

<p>Indonesian government and military, following in the footsteps of the 
United States, steamrolled through international pleading, trashed the 
peace talks and launched a
military crack down of Aceh.

<p>Besides arresting the negotiators, the military campaign started with a 
dramatic photo opportunity as the Indonesian military parachuted hundreds 
of soldiers into the Banda Aceh airport, a location they already 
controlled. Why didn't they just disembark out of a landed plane. This 
stunt rivals the grandiose rescue of Jessica Lynch in Iraq.

<p>However, staged photo-ops are only one way to manipulate a "free 
media".  Fifty Indonesian journalists have been embedded in the Indonesian 
military (TNI), a cadre of individuals whose newspapers largely support the 
Indonesian military action in Aceh. It appears that in Aceh, as in Iraq,

mainstream media has surrendered its perspective and impartiality by 
becoming the public relations arm of bloodthirsty governments.

<p>Like the USA, Indonesia also uses the label of terrorism to validate its

war on Aceh. A senior advisor of President Sukarnoputri said  that 
separatist movements, like the GAM, could now be considered terrorist 
groups. I wonder how she would label the the United States revolutionary

patriots?

<p>A major component of the U.S.-led war on Iraq was control of Iraq's oil.

<p>The war in Aceh also has similar subtexts. The gas-rich area of 
northwestern Sumatra houses a huge Exxon-Mobil gas field which is at the

heart of the controversy. Acehnese universally claim that revenues from 
natural resources found in Aceh are distributed unequally to the benefit of 
the Indonesian government.

<p>To complicate matters, the Exxon-Mobil plant is guarded by the Indonesian 
military which, according to human rights groups, receives upwards of 
$100,000 per month for security services from the corporation. In a dual

role, the TNI forces is massacring civilians while protecting the interests 
of multi-national enterprise.

<p>The TNI is using U.S.-made military equipment in Aceh that it acquired 
prior to the U.S. Congressional ban on military sales, according to Human 
Rights Watch. While currently not supplying the Indonesian military with

weapons, last year the House and Senate Appropriations Committees voted to 
restart the International Military Education and Training for 
Indonesia  akin to the training that Latin American soldiers receive at the 
School of the Americas at Ft. Benning, GA.

<p>The Indonesian troops have drawn lessons from the US military doctrine of 
"overwhelming force" General Endriartono Sutarto told his troops to fight 
the rebels "until your last drop of blood," telling them that "you are 
trained to kill, so wipe them out."

<p>What concerns many humanitarian groups in Aceh and the international 
community is that civilians, and human rights workers, are already being

killed in this renewed war. An estimated 10,000 innocent people have been 
killed in the 26-year-old fight for independence, and according to recent 
UNICEF figures, 23,000 children have been displaced. Plans for massive 
civilian relocation camps trouble many people concerned with human rights 
violations in the region.

<p>With disturbing parallels from the U.S.-led invasion Iraq, the Indonesian 
invasion last week could signal a dangerous trend in international affairs. 
Has diplomacy become a disingenuous euphemism for placating other 
countries' hopes for peaceful resolution of disputes and flouting the rule 
of international law until the military is good and ready to attack?

<p>How many other countries will resort to force rather than dialogue?
