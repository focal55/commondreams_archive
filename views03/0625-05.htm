<p>In the past few weeks, there have been many questions raised in the 
U.S. and world press about whether George Bush knowingly presented 
fraudulent evidence about the existence of a nuclear capability in 
Iraq. It was on the basis of such Weapons of Mass Destruction,(WMD) 
that Iraq was said to present a danger to the US. This was the U.S. 
government's public justification for its war against Iraq. 

<p>Currently there are inquiries by the British, US and Australian 
governments about the use of such a fraudulent case to justify war. One 
of the most significant falsifications in the WMD public debate, is 
Bush's reference to an alleged attempt by Iraq to buy 500 tons of 
uranium oxide from the African country, Niger. In his State of the 
Union address on January 28, 2003, Bush declared that, "The British 
government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant 
quantities of uranium from Africa." 

<p>Similar claims had been made by the CIA in their September 24, 2002 
briefing to the Congress. The case for Iraq's nuclear capability was 
based on documents known to be forged as of March 2002. Yet the claims 
continued to be used by Bush, by the CIA, and by other administration 
officials as a key component of their case for the war against Iraq. 

<p>According to several different reports, in 2001, the CIA learned of the 
claims about Iraq trying to buy uranium oxide from Niger. Vice 
President Dick Cheney's office raised questions about this situation in 
February 2002. The CIA sent a former U.S. ambassador, one who was 
respected in Africa, to Niger, to speak with government officials 
there. The ambassador learned that the dates and signatures on the 
documents being used to support the claim were fraudulent. He reported 
his findings back to the CIA. A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52813-2003Jun12.html?nav=%20hptop_ts%20" target="_new">Washington Post article</a>  indicates 
that the CIA sent the White House a report of the fraudulent nature of 
the documents in March 2002. Six months later, however, in September 
2002, the head of the CIA was still referring to a nuclear weapons 
program in Iraq. The reports are that he referred to the Niger 
information, without presenting the result of the ambassador's 
investigation. A number of Congressmen say they voted to authorize a 
war against Iraq based on the administration claim that Iraq had a 
nuclear capability. The Democratic Party minority has now asked for a 
transcript of the CIA official testimony at the September 24, 2002 
Congressional hearing. They want to determine whether the CIA testimony 
at the hearing presented the forged nature of the Niger documents. 

<p>Other CIA or State Department activities in 2002 and 2003 continued, 
making the same case to justify a war against Iraq. For example, in 
response to the Iraq weapons declaration filed with the UN on December 
7, 2002, Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN 
Security Council on December 19, 2002. He presented the Security 
Council with a one page State Department fact sheet in response to the 
Iraqi declaration. That fact sheet stated that, "The Declaration 
ignores efforts to procure uranium from Niger. Why is the Iraqi regime 
hiding their uranium procurement?" 

<p>After Bush's State of the Union speech, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) requested that the U.S. government provide evidence about 
the Iraqi efforts to purchase uranium oxide in Africa. On March 7, 
2003, a day after the documents were finally given to the Agency, the 
head of the agency, Director General Mohamed ElBaradei publicly 
presented that the documents were forgeries. 

<p>On March 17, 2003, Representative Henry Waxman, a Democratic 
Congressman from California, and minority Chair of the Government 
Reform Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, wrote a 
<a href="http://www.house.gov/waxman/text/admin_iraq_march_17_let.htm" target="_new">letter</a> to Bush's office asking for an explanation of how the case 
for a nuclear capacity in Iraq could be built on the basis of forged 
documents. 

<p>He received a response from Paul Kelly, of the State Department 
legislative office. Kelly writes: 

<p><i>Beginning in late 2001, the United States obtained information through 
several channels, including U.S. intelligence sources and overt 
sources, reporting that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium from 
Africa. In addition, two Western European allies informed us of similar 
reporting from their own intelligence services. As you know, the UK 
made this information public in its September 2002 dossier on "Iraq's 
Weapons of Mass Destruction." The other Western European ally relayed 
this information to us privately and said, while it did not believe any 
uranium had been shipped to Iraq, it believed Iraq had sought to 
purchase uranium from Niger. We sought several times to determine the 
basis for the latter assessment, and whether it was based on 
independent evidence not otherwise available to the U.S. Not until 
March 4 did we learn that in fact the second Western European 
government had based its assessment on evidence already available to 
the U.S. that was subsequently discredited.</i> -- Letter from Paul V. Kelly, Assistant Secretary of Legislative Affairs, 
U.S. Dept of State, April 29, 2003   

<p>The U.S. government had used the case for Iraq's nuclear capability in 
the case Powell made to the UN Security Council on December 19, 2002 
and in the President's State of the Union address on January 28, 2003, 
even though they knew there were forged documents as the basis for this 
claim. Kelly suggests that it was all right to continue to make the 
case, based on hearsay evidence from some other country, until they 
learned on March 4, 2003 that the other Western European government 
information was also based on forged documents. Such reasoning 
continues the deception. It doesn't acknowledge the responsibility of 
government officials to honest activity in the conduct of their office. 
Once forged documents are recognized, and Kelly acknowledges the 
recognition of the forgery, there is no basis to continue to make a 
case. There is the responsibility to challenge any other documents 
which make a similar case. 

<p>While such an excuse for including discredited information in an 
important speech like the President's State of the Union speech appears 
flimsy at best, yet another explanation has been given by National 
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice when she appeared on Sunday 
television talk shows on June 8, 2003. She said that the President's 
Office didn't know that the CIA had judged the Niger story to be based 
on forged documents. 

<p>In a <a href="http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs_108/pdf_inves/pdf_admin_iraq_nuclear_evidence_june_10_let.pdf" target="_new">letter</a>  to Rice on June 10, Waxman quotes her comments. She 
says: 

<p><i>..I will tell you that when this issue was raised with the 
intelligence community...the intelligence community did not know at 
that time, or at levels that got to us, that there were serious 
questions about this report. </i>
<p>Disputing Rice's claim that the State Department did not know of the 
forgeries, Greg Thielmann describes how his office conveyed this 
information to the Department of the Secretary of State well before the 
State of the Union address. As Director of the State Department Bureau 
of Intelligence and Research (INR) until Fall 2002, he explains that 
the Niger documents were judged to be "garbage" by his office. He 
reports that this judgement was conveyed at that time to the Office of 
the U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell. Thielmann has been quoted in 
newspaper and magazine accounts and has appeared on television 
interviews refuting that the State Department did not know of the 
forgeries. 

<p>Whether or not the Bush administration recognized the fraudulent nature 
of the Niger documents as the case for Iraq's possession of nuclear 
weapons before the first week in March 2003, however, still does not 
relieve them of a responsibility regarding the discrepancy between the 
nature of their case for war and the evidence they provided for that 
case. Kelly admits that by March 4, 2003 the forgery was known. There 
was still plenty of time for George Bush to reverse the decision to go 
to war against Iraq. He didn't reverse it. No other reliable evidence 
was presented at the time of any Iraqi nuclear capacity. Yet on March 
19, 2003, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030319-17.html" target="_new">George Bush announced</a>  the beginning of a war against 
Iraq, claiming that the purpose of the war was to" disarm Iraq and 
to...defend the world from grave danger." 

<p>One conclusion that can be drawn is that it didn't matter to George 
Bush that the reasons given to the public to go to war against Iraq 
were based on fraudulent evidence. Whether the public was behind Bush's 
march to war or not, was unimportant to Bush. He couldn't know that 
unless an honest case was made to the public about the reasons for 
going to war. 

<p>What is the effect of having presented a fraudulent case to the U.S. 
Congress, the U.S. public, the U.N. Security Council, and the world 
about the reasons for a war against Iraq? John W. Dean, former Counsel 
to the Nixon White House, recently reminded the public that the abuse 
of U.S. government processes by the President and other offices of 
government is a crime of the highest order. Though Dean doesn't mention 
the fraudulent nature of the U.S. government claims about Iraq's 
nuclear capability, he does explain that lies by government officials 
regarding WMD in Iraq are a challenge to the integrity of the U.S. 
government. Waging war against a sovereign nation based on fraudulent 
claims and misrepresentations like those presented about the existence 
of WMD in Iraq, is a challenge to any pretense of democratic processes. 
How can people oversee what their government officials are doing if the 
government officials openly lie to them? How can there be any pretense 
of constitutional processes where sovereignty resides with the people 
if they are not allowed to know what government officials are doing? 
This is a serious challenge to the nature and future of law and 
government. Whether this challenge can be taken up or not is an 
important question for our times.
