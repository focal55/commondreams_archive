<p> The war was thoroughly unpopular: its objectives confused, if not downright dishonest, its consequences increasingly fraught. The times required someone to act as a rallying point against a president the pundits assumed was invulnerable. An improbable figure emerged to do precisely that. <P>Thirty-five years ago tomorrow, on March 12 1968, a date described by the journalist Tom Wicker as an Agincourt in American politics, the earth shook. The Vietnam war did not cease at once: the final act was another seven years away. But from that moment the Americans' passage deeper and deeper into that particular bog ceased, and they began to turn round. From that day on, the US stopped thinking about winning, and started thinking about how the hell to get out.  <P>March 12 was the date of the New Hampshire primary, and the improbable figure was Eugene McCarthy, the senator from Minnesota: little known, donnish, a writer and poet, decidedly different from the average politician. McCarthy took 42% of the Democratic vote, only just behind President Lyndon Johnson. A few days earlier it had been assumed he might get 10% or so.  <P>The McCarthy campaign was based on the support of about 10,000 anti-war students who descended on New Hampshire. The ones who looked most freaky, in keeping with the fashions of the time, were confined to indoor duties. Only those who smartened up - "Clean for Gene" - were allowed on the streets. It was described as a "children's crusade".  <P>The consequences of that one vote were staggering. Within days, Bobby Kennedy, brother of the martyred president, entered the race as another anti-war candidate after months of dithering. Before the month was over, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election. Only 10 weeks after that, Bobby was murdered, moments after accepting victory in the California primary. By then the overtly anti-war vote had been irreparably sundered, and the nomination fell to Johnson's gushy vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, at a convention infamous for the way the Chicago police smashed the heads of the anti-war demonstrators. Humphrey then lost, narrowly, to Richard Nixon.  <P>To anyone even half alert at the time, it was stunningly vivid. But that means you now have to be pretty close to 50. Nowadays people get confused between Gene McCarthy and his namesake Joe, the communist witch-hunter of the early 1950s. And the principals are dead now, bar one. Gene McCarthy is almost 87, largely forgotten, but still senatorially handsome, sharp, erudite and funny: he lives in a retirement home "like a cruise boat on the River Styx". Last week he was re-reading Lord of the Flies: "It's about the Bush administration, you know," he said.  <P>It seems faintly absurd to ask McCarthy what he thinks about Iraq. Always a little fey and detached, he can hardly help finding present events ridiculous. "The Vietnam thing lasted 20 years before it became a real war. This just sort of developed from young Bush's plans. My feeling is it won't last long. It's a bit like one of those Roman wars where a general got an army together and went to Africa."  <P>I said I assumed he was against it. "I've been pretty negative about everything in government for 15 or 20 years," he replied. "I've been putting together an article on de Tocqueville, who said pretty much what Eisenhower said about the military-industrial complex. If the army gets so large that no one knows what to do with it, you get a sort of parallel state." McCarthy finds it hard to summon more than genial contempt for the present regime. He is especially appalled by Bush's constant invocation of religion, "but you forgive him because you don't think he understands it, anyway".  <P>"You know, the worst person to elect as president is a state governor. They've inflicted capital punishment so they're not afraid of death, They've sent out the National Guard. Clinton ran the presidency as though it was a governorship, and so did Jimmy Carter. Former vice-presidents are almost as bad, because they've been destroyed by their old job. I'd only elect senators and college professors. And newspaper men." Then he was off on to another marvelous riff about Nixon trying to eliminate the pigeons from Washington, because they flew over his first inaugural parade.  
<P>Only dolts imagine there are precise historical parallels between different eras, wars and elections. There is no new Hitler in this war, no new Churchill, no new Jack Kennedy. And we have yet to find the new Gene McCarthy, brave and skillful enough to stand up into the teeth of the political gale, articulate an inchoate public feeling, and do it with wit, grace and style.
