<p>What was the lowest point in Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's
appearance on <i>Oprah</i>? Was it when the three of them chortled and
beamed about how exciting it was for Arnold to learn about "all those
issues" he'll have to deal with as governor ("Like are they at your
house to--teaching you stuff every night?" Ms. Winfrey asked)--and the
audience applauded? Or was it when Schwarzenegger compared his refusal
to participate in more than one debate to the way he had skipped over
the Mr. Venice Beach contest and gone straight for the Mr. Olympia
title--and the audience applauded? Hurray for the candidate with no
experience, no information and no knowledge! Bravo for the candidate who
won't stoop to defending his platform--or even explain what it is!
</p>
<p>

The purpose of this hourlong infomercial--but why, Oprah, why?--was to
give Schwarzenegger a chance to debunk his image as a male chauvinist
boor with Oprah's huge, mostly female audience, and who knows, maybe it
worked. First there was Maria, glamorous, lean as a whippet, her diamond
cross sparkling against her black long-sleeved sweater, enthusiastically
proclaiming how much she loved him, how ardently he supported her career
(he was "one of the most gracious, supportive women--I mean man--man
I've ever met") and how peeved she was by suggestions that as a Kennedy
female she had been "bred to look the other way" while her husband
pawed, cavorted and harassed his way through life. Those stories were
all lies. Then Arnold bounded out looking tanned and relaxed, and the
three sat around like the old showbiz troupers and friends they are and
laughed about the cup of coffee Arnold makes Maria every morning, and
the children, who do their own laundry and are being brought up to be,
says Maria, "kind, polite, you know, grateful" (grateful?
<i>Achtung!</i>), and the crazy things people did back in the 1970s,
when Arnold told <i>Oui </i>magazine that he took part in a gangbang of
a "black girl" at Gold's Gym. Except maybe he didn't: "The idea was
always to say things, as I said, over the top so you get the headlines
because bodybuilding, like I said, had no reputation yet." He was just
pretending to be a macho jerk for the good of the sport. See?
</p>
<p>

As of this writing the California recall has been postponed, which is
supposed to hurt Schwarzenegger, because it allows people more time to
find out how conservative and obnoxious and ignorant he is. (I know, I
know, I say that like it's a bad thing.) But it also allows him more
time to win over women, who favor his Democratic rival Cruz Bustamante.
The media seem determined to defuse the sexism issue. On CNN, Howie
Kurtz pooh-poohed the <i>Oui</i> interview as "celebrity gossip," and
his guest William Bastone of TheSmokingGun.com barely demurred, even
though Bastone broke the story. The day after the <i>Oprah</i>
appearance, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> ran a front-page article
pointing out how often in his career Schwarzenegger has noted that a
woman is "smart" or mentioned brains as a good thing for a woman to
have. As he says in the July <i>Esquire</i>, "When you see a blonde with
great tits and a great ass, you say to yourself, hey, she must be stupid
or must have nothing else to offer.... But then again there is the one
that is as smart as her breasts look, great as her face looks, beautiful
as her whole body looks gorgeous, you know, so people are shocked."
</p>
<p>

Now just imagine for a moment that a Democratic politician had told a
soft-core men's magazine in 1977 about gangbanging a "black girl"--and
when asked about it in 2003 said he didn't remember a thing about the
interview or the incident itself, but also said he made the whole thing
up to get attention. Would that story have been relegated to the bin of
youthful escapades by Fox, CNN, the <i>New York Post</i>, Peggy Noonan,
Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and the rest? Or would we be hearing a lot
about "character" and the "I was lying" defense? Suppose that same
Democrat told <i>Playboy</i> in 1988 he didn't allow his wife or mother
(?!) to wear pants in public. And suppose that in 2000, two British
television journalists accused that Democrat, now 53, well past the
youthful-escapade phase, of groping them, and publicly declared
themselves disgusted and offended? Let's say that he told
<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> this past July how fun it was to push
Kristanna Loken's head into a toilet in <i>Terminator 3</i> ("I wanted
to have something floating in there"). Let's say papers in Britain were
reporting all this and more--from feeling up women in the presence of
his wife to heavy use of illegal steroids to rumors of an extramarital
affair with a 16-year-old actress--wouldn't we be hearing about it night
and day?
</p>
<p>

And if that Democrat was a woman? Forget it! A rich, egocentric, freaky
Hollywood diva whose naked photos were plastered all over cyberspace,
who waves away questions about her program ("details, details!") would
have no credibility in the first place. Angelina Jolie for governor of
the fifth-largest economy in the world? Are you out of your mind? But
even if she were a Rhodes scholar, a four-star general and a churchgoing
mother of six, that woman would be finished the minute the media turned
up so much as the femur or tibia of a sexual skeleton among the power
suits in her closet. Wherever that "black girl" is today, you can bet
it's not politics. What's good for the groper is not good for the
groupie.
</p>
<p>

The explanation for the political and gender double standard can't be
something as simple as the media being mostly owned by conservatives and
mostly written, edited, produced and spoken by men--can it? (Fun fact:
There are actually fewer female newspaper executives or top editors
today than five years ago.) After all, there is Oprah--the queen of
go-girl empowerment, the anti-Howard Stern, the woman who brought Toni
Morrison to the masses--and Oprah thinks Arnold Schwarzenegger is a
prince among men. Celebrity is thicker than sisterhood. Now that she has
jumped into the California recall, the <i>New York Times</i> rightly
called on Oprah to invite all the major candidates onto her show. The
people who really need a platform, though, are the women like the
activists of Code Pink who follow Schwarzenegger around with their
Arnold,You're Terminated banner--the women who think humiliating,
insulting and harassing women is something worth talking about.</p><p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2003 The Nation</p>
