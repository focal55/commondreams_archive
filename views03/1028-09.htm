<p><i>&quot;There's no such thing as a stupid question.&quot;
</i>- My sixth grade teacher
<p>Was President Bush just pulling our leg when he first appointed Henry Kissinger to head the federal 9/11 investigation commission? And why is the Bush White House refusing to release information being requested by the bipartisan 9/11 commission now?

 

<p>In a capitalist economy like ours, isn't the cause of poverty a lack of capital? And if so, shouldn't fighting poverty be more about democratizing capital instead of pursuing policies that trap people in the work-spend cycle, which makes capital accumulation impossible for all but a few?


<p>While Rush is on ice in the rehab center, trying to kick his Oxycontin addiction, will he realize that his ESPN resignation wasn't so much about race as it was stupidity? Has Rush ever heard of Doug Williams or Randall Cunningham or Steve McNair? And will somebody tell him that the NFL already has a QB poster boy - he's a black guy named Michael Vick?

<p>I understand that Rush was probably trying to make a "subtle" political point about affirmative action and the secret media conspiracy to destroy America with liberal propaganda, but, honestly, how did he get that job as an ESPN analyst? I mean, if a political pundit is going to cross over into NFL commentary, shouldn't he or she at least be as knowledgeable about football as George Will is about baseball?

<p>Doesn't the resignation of a white sports analyst, who made a stupid remark about a black quarterback in a demonstration of just how unqualified he was for the job, help make the case that affirmative action has not outlived its usefulness?


<p>Why do banks charge something like $25 for writing a bad check? If I write a bad check, doesn't that mean I don't have the money? And why do banks keep their vault doors open during business hours but chain their pens to the counters?


<p>Isn't UNSCOM inspector Scott Ritter, who said long before the invasion of Iraq that his team of weapons inspectors had disarmed 85 to 95 percent of Iraq's WMD capabilities in the 1990s, owed an apology by those who viciously attacked him as a traitor for speaking out against the shaky Bush administration claim that Iraq posed a threat to world security?


<p>In our religious obedience to the notion of sacred violence, why do we fail to make the distinction between being willing to die for freedom and being willing to kill for it, which is, ultimately, what war is all about?


<p>Why do historians consider the last 10,000 years as the complete story of human history when biologists and anthropologists remind us that the human species has been on this planet for 3 million years?

<p>Are those other 2.9 million years what they call human "pre-history." What is the best form of human social organization? Might the answer to that question be found in human "pre-history" instead of where most political scientists look for it, namely among civilizations of the last 10,000 years?


<p>Now that Arnold has been elected the Republican governator of California, will conservative pundits continue to ridicule other Hollywood celebs like Danny Glover and Sean Penn for sticking their noses in the real life world of politics, speaking out against the illegal wars of special interest groups (i.e. Halliburton, etc.)?

<p>Given his stellar performances as a deranged, civil-liberty hating cop in "Lethal Weapon" and his portrayal of patriotic warriors in "The Patriot" and "Braveheart," should Mel Gibson be our next president?
