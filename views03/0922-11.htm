<p>The satire "Wag the Dog," a cinematic artifact from the lost age of 1997, 
may occupy a unique place in film history. It is becoming our national 
portrait in the attic, worth a trip up the stairs every few years so that we

may gaze upon its shifting surface and behold the latest, ghastly truths

that have become visible there, reflecting our real political face.

<p>It started out as a fairly puerile idea: The sparse, fuzzy green video of 
the Gulf War easily could have been faked using miniatures and special 
effects. What if Bush I had faked the war to boost a sagging presidency and 
his re-election chances? This was embroidered by David Mamet and Barry 
Levinson into a broad farce with the premise of a presidential sex scandal 
tossed in to motivate the media distraction of a fake war. Mere weeks after 
its release, the movie that had been intended as a parody of the Bush 
administration showed its astonishing predictive powers when the Clinton sex

scandal broke, a virtual mirror image of the one concocted by the 
filmmakers. The astonishment stakes were raised when Clinton started lobbing


missiles into Iraq to distract from the impeachment hearings.

<p>Seen today, the movie's sex scandal trappings fall away and the rest of the 
film jumps out in high relief. Astonishment ascends to hair-raising wonder 
at a movie that seems fated to be a political ouija board:

<p>- The plotters decide to declare a backwater country a haven for terrorists.

<p>Also, the plotters decide, the designated nation has acquired nuclear 
capability. We are in imminent danger from their weapons of mass 
destruction. We must go to war immediately to defend ourselves.

<p>- In one scene, chief White House spinmeister Robert DeNiro talks his way 
out of a tight spot with CIA agents who have discovered the plot and are not

thrilled. They have intelligence that makes it clear the alleged threat 
being used as the basis for war is a fraud. DeNiro proclaims his fake war is

part of the "new kind of war" that must be fought against terrorists. The 
CIA acquiesces to his logic.

<p>- The necessary patriotic songs memorializing the forthcoming splendid 
little war are shown being scored and orchestrated. Mamet lays on the 
schmaltz with a trowel, but still can't match the real thing, to be heard on

the nation's radios four years later.

<p>- A random soldier is selected to be a prisoner of war. The concocted p.r. 
tale of the designated war hero's ordeal triggers the intended media frenzy,

transfixing the nation and causing support for the war and the president to 
skyrocket.

<p>- A farrago of official lies, catch phrases fall-back positions when things 
go wrong, and easy manipulations of the media and public opinion unspool

with pinpoint predictive accuracy.

<p>Needless to say, this film could not be made today. The theme of our 
besotted infatuation with string-pulling patriotism and all things martial 
-- though nothing in the movie approaches the reality of a president in a 
Navy flight suit landing on an aircraft carrier ordered to halt for the 
photo op -- is a form of satire that met its expiration date on Sept. 10, 
2001. More to the point, what was biting, cynical political satire in 1997 
is no longer cynical enough. The film's plotters don't kill anybody (other 
than one of their own overly talkative members). The fake war is literally 
fake. The motive in the movie was simply to sink a scandal and win an 
election, not secure world domination and initiate a right-wing dream 
project for a New American Century. It is about mere personal corruption, 
not the abduction of a nation and the destruction of another in the name of 
a mad ideology. Hence, "Wag the Dog" is now both scary and quaint 
simultaneously.

<p>And, of course, the movie is no longer even a little bit funny.
