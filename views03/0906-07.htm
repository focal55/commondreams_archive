<p>James Jesus Angleton embodied the inevitable trajectory of a person committed 
to counterintelligence. Maybe he got a little crazy at the end but that might 
explain why we are all getting a little crazy too.

<p>Angleton was director of counterintelligence for the CIA from 1954 until 1974. 
Fans of spy fiction might think of him as John Le Carre's George Smiley, but 
that portrait puts a benign and smiling face on the grimace that 
counterintelligence practitioners can't completely hide.
<p>For twenty years, Angleton's job was to doubt everything. This enigmatic 
figure presented puzzles for people to solve in every conversation, stitched 
designer lies into every narrative, trusted no one.
<p>The task of counterintelligence is to figure out what the other side is doing, 
how they are deceiving us, what double agents they have planted in our midst. 
CI is predicated on double deceiving and triple deceiving the other side into 
believing fictions nested within fictions, always leavened with some facts,  
just enough to seem real. 
<p>Counterintelligence is a dangerous game. You have to be willing to sacrifice 
pawns to save queens. Those pawns may be loyal agents but nothing you have 
told them, no promises or pledges, can stand in the way of letting them go 
when you have to, letting them be tortured or killed or imprisoned for life to 
protect a plan of action.
<p>Angleton came to suspect everyone. Whenever a mole was uncovered in our ranks, 
he believed that he had been allowed to discover that mole to protect a bigger 
one, higher up.
<p>You see how the moebius strip twists back onto itself. Every successful 
operation is suspect. If you discover double agents in your own ranks, it is 
because the other side wanted you to find them. The more important the agent 
you uncover, that is how much more important must be the one you have not yet 
found.
<p>Example. The Americans built a tunnel under the Berlin wall so they could tap 
Soviet military traffic. In fact, a mole working for the Soviets told them 
about the taps. But he told the KGB, not the military whose traffic was 
tapped. The KGB did not tell the military because then they might alter the 
traffic which would signal that the Soviets knew about the taps. That in turn 
would mean there was a mole. So to protect the mole, the traffic was allowed 
to continue unimpeded. 
<p>The Americans, once they knew about the mole, concluded that the intercepted 
traffic had been bogus because the operation had been compromised from the 
beginning when in fact the Soviets had let the Americans tap the traffic, 
saving their mole for future operations. 
<p>You get the idea. It's not that we know that they know that we know but 
whether or not they know that we know that they know that we know.
<p>It takes a particular kind of person to do this sort of work. Not everyone is 
cut out for distrusting everybody and everything, for thinking that whatever 
they accomplish, they were allowed to do it to protect something more 
important. Daily life for most people means accepting the facts of life at 
face value and trusting the transactions in which we are engaged, trusting the 
meaning of words, trusting that there is firm ground under our feet.
<p>Otherwise we inevitably tend where Angleton tended. Every defector considered 
a plant, every double agent considered a triple agent, everyone in the 
American network considered compromised. Angleton tore the agency apart, 
looking for the mole he was sure the moles he found were protecting. 
<p>I am struck lately by how many plain people, mainstream folks uninvolved in 
intelligence work, volunteer that they distrust every word uttered by the 
government or the media. How many treat all the news as leaks or designer lies 
that must be deconstructed to find a motive, plan or hidden agenda. Daily life 
has become an exercise in counterintelligence just to figure out what's going 
on. 

<p>It's not a question of party politics. This is deeper than that. It's about 
trying to find our balance as we teeter precariously on the moebius strip of 
cover and deception that cloaks our public life, that governs the selling of 
the latest war, that called the air in New York clean instead of lethal, that 
has darkened the life of a formerly free people who enjoyed constitutional 
rights as if there's a mid-day eclipse. We see our own civil affairs through a 
glass darkly and nobody really knows what's what. 

<p>As the envelope of secrecy within which our government works has become less 
and less transparent, the projection of wild scenarios onto that blank space 
where the truth was once written has become more evident. But that only makes 
sense. The inability to know what is true unless you are a specialist in 
investigative work makes our feelings of dissonance, our craziness 
understandable. 

<p>We are all getting a little crazy about now. We are becoming the confused and 
confusing person of James Jesus Angleton in a vast undifferentiated mass, a 
citizenry treated as if we are the enemy of our own government. We spend too 
much time trying to find that coherent story that makes sense of the 
contradictory narratives fed to us day and night by an immense iron-dark 
machine riding loud in our lives.

<p>It got to be too much and at last they let Angleton go into that good night in 
which he had long lived where nothing was what it seemed and everyone was 
suspect. So he retired and went fishing. But where can we go? On what serene 
lake should we go fish, listening to the cry of the loons, trailing our hands 
in the cold water because cold is at least a fact we can feel, one of the few 
in a world gone dark and very liquid?
