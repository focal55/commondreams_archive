<p>On Feb. 24th, 20 of us set up a 4-day tent encampment
in the Demilitarized Zone between Iraq and Kuwait. 
"Between heaven and hell, that's how I felt, the whole
day" said our Franciscan priest, Jerry Zawada.
<p>When we arrived, the sky was darkening, thunder
rumbled across the desert.  Yet the border area,
desolate and dramatic, was oddly still.  Neville
Watson, an Australian lawyer and Uniting Church
minister, recalled the original Gulf Peace Team camp
in January, 1991.  Then, anticipating war, our
encampment on the Iraq side of the Iraq-Saudi border,
was filled with futility and despair the first night
of the Gulf War.  Huddled together beneath the clear
skies on a cold moonless night, 72 of us watched and
listened as bombers flew overhead once every five
minutes.  Within three days, Iraq's electrical grid
was destroyed, along with much of its crucial
infrastructure.  Now, 12 years later, Neville
murmured, "What does it take to stop such madness?  Is
nothing changed?" 

<p>Later in the day, Neville and I agreed there are
significant differences, mainly because so many people
now feel a personal commitment to stop this war. 
<p>Yesterday we walked to the border post carrying
enlarged vinyl banners bearing pictures of people
we've met.  From a short distance it almost looked as
though these friends were walking alongside us.
Examining the pictures more carefully, I recognized
several children from the nearby village of Abu
Faloos, a forlorn little place known to us mainly
because a little girl who lives there was struck by a
bomb on January 25, 1999.  The bomb, aimed at a
fertilizer factory, missed its intended target and hit
Israa as she left her school.  She now has only one
arm and bears large scars on her torso and belly. 
After we leave the border, we can bring the beautiful
vinyl pictures of children from Abu Faloos to the
village.  What an adornment.
<p>A bevy of Basra shoeshine boys had wished us well
as we left for the border.  Akram, Haider, Zayn, and
Ali are grade school kids who've befriended us through
multiple visits.  Archbishop Kassab blessed us and
invited Jerry to return and celebrate a Liturgy.  Some
of us went to visit friends in Jumurriyah, Basra's
poorest neighborhood, during later afternoon hours.  
<p>We attached the posters on the border crossing gate. 
We draped paper cranes made by school children from
Eureka, CA over a tall rusted rectangle frame in the
roadway and then wrapped a second string of the
colorful tiny paper birds over a stretch of ugly
coiled barbed wire.  We read aloud letters, some of
them poignantly funny in their crude level of
awareness, from high school students in Western
Washington.  
<p>Presently our outreach effort reaches a large
support network and thousands beyond  - messages
stream forth in hope of stopping a war.  The tiny
arrow we represent points to possibilities of unarmed intervention, someday - perhaps in a future when
America gains political maturity.   
<p>Late last night, air raid sirens droned for
several minutes before midnight.  I thought of my
visit, several weeks ago, with a Basran friend who was
confined to bed rest because of a difficult pregnancy.
 She and her children live on the second floor of a
small cramped dwelling.  "My children - they hear
siren and they seize me.  They insist, they want me to
come downstairs.  And I tell them, 'No, there is no
difference between upstairs and downstairs.  There is protection only in Allah and Allah is everywhere'". 
And so it goes. The massive capacity for destruction
on the other side of this border can erupt across this
very road where we now sit, damning many thousands to
hellfire in the weeks ahead.
<p>Vulnerable, unarmed, without the slightest desire
to bring harm to American people, a haven and heaven
of innocence dwells in neighborhoods, throughout
villages and cities, on this side - on the cusp of
heaven and hell.
