<p>Years ago, I was asked to write a speech for President Nixon. 

<p>I didn't do that, but I wish President Bush would ask me to write a speech for him now. 

<p>Here's what I'd write if he asked me to - which is unlikely: 

<p>My fellow Americans - (the word "fellow" includes women in political speeches): 

<p>My fellow Americans. One of the reasons we invaded Iraq was because I suggested Saddam Hussein had something to do with the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. No evidence that's so, I wish I hadn't said it. 

<p>I said we were going to get Saddam Hussein. To be honest, we don't know whether we got him or not. Probably not. 

<p>I said we'd get Osama bin Laden and wipe out al Qaeda. We haven't been able to do that, either. I'm as disappointed as you are. 

<p>I probably shouldn't have said Iraq had nuclear weapons. Our guys and the U.N. have looked under every bed in Iraq and can't find one. 

<p>In one speech, I told you Saddam Hussein tried to buy the makings of nuclear bombs from Africa. That was a mistake and I wish I hadn't said that. I get bad information sometimes just like you do. 

<p>On May 1, I declared major combat was over and gave you the impression the war was over. I shouldn't have declared that. Since then, 215 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq. As the person who sent them there, how terrible do you think that makes me feel? 

<p>I promised to leave no child behind when it comes to education. Then I asked for an additional $87 billion for Iraq. It has to come from somewhere. I hope the kids aren't going to have to pay for it - now in school or later when they're your age. 

<p>When I landed on the deck of the carrier, I wish they hadn't put up the sign saying MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. It isn't accomplished. 

<p>Maybe it should have been MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. 

<p>I've made some mistakes and I regret it. Let me just read you excerpts from something my father wrote five years ago in his book, “A World Transformed.” 

<p><i>I firmly believed we should not march into Baghdad ...To occupy Iraq would instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab world against us and make a broken tyrant, into a latter-day Arab hero … </i>
<p>This is my father writing this. 

<p><i>...assigning young soldiers to a fruitless hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning them to fight in what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war. </i>
<p>We should all take our father's advice. 

<p>That's the speech I'd write for President Bush. No charge.
