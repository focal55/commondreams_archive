<p>Many around the world are skeptical when George Bush says he wants to use 
war to help create democracy in Iraq. As a step toward bolstering his 
credibility, Bush might start taking seriously democracy in the rest of the 
world, and at home.
<p>U.S. reaction to the weekend news that Turkey's parliament had rejected a 
proposal to accept the basing of U.S. troops for an Iraq war only confirmed 
what has long been obvious: The Bush administration believes democracy is 
wonderful -- so long as it doesn't get in the way of war.
<p>Let's remember the basic notions behind democracy: The people are 
sovereign. Power flows from the people. Leadership is beholden to the people.
<p>If those ideas are at the core of democracy, Bush's recent reaction to the 
will of the people suggests he has contempt for the concept.
<p>Bush has a habit of praising as "courageous" those leaders who most 
effectively ignore their people. In the U.K., polls show more than half the 
public against the war, and close to a million people turned out for the
Feb. 15 protest in London. In Spain, 2 million hit the streets of Barcelona 
and Madrid, and 74 percent oppose the war. But Bush has praised the courage 
of prime ministers Tony Blair and Jose Maria Aznar in remaining fanatically 
prowar in the face of massive public opposition.
<p>Silvio Berlusconi is another favorite of Bush. The Italian prime minister 
has to ignore the 80 percent of his people who object to the war, and on
Feb. 15 the largest demonstrations in the world were in Rome, where police 
put the crowd at 1 million and others estimated two to three times that many.
<p>But perhaps the most courageous leader in Bush-speak is the prime minister 
of Turkey, Abdullah Gul.
<p>The Bush team found that it took some convincing (and $15 billion) to 
secure the ruling Justice and Development Party leadership's support for
U.S. use of bases for a war. In that effort, as a former Pentagon planner 
and ambassador to Turkey explained, "the biggest problem is that 94 percent 
of the Turks are opposed to war."
<p>After winning over the key leadership, U.S. officials faced another 
problem: The Turkish constitution requires a vote of parliament to allow
those new U.S. troops. With tens of thousands of Turks protesting in the
streets during the debate, the proposal failed by a narrow margin.
<p>The State Department, expecting a favorable vote, had prepared a statement 
of congratulations. Because the initial reports out of parliament suggested 
the proposal had won, that statement was released and -- you guessed it
-- it applauded the Turkish government for its "courageous leadership."
<p>U.S. officials hope to reverse the vote later this week. No doubt Bush's
people will be tough negotiators, but the Turks also can expect 
understanding of the problems that Gul and his party face. During earlier 
negotiations between the United States and Turkey, one U.S. official 
explained the process was time-consuming because, "We are dealing with a
new and inexperienced [Turkish] leadership that is feeling very much caught 
by the situation."

<p>"Experience" in this context means the ability to ignore and override the 
will of the people, an endeavor in which U.S. politicians have considerable 
experience.

<p>And what of democracy at home? When asked about his reaction to the 
hundreds of thousands of Americans who rallied on Feb. 15 to oppose a war, 
Bush brushed them off as irrelevant. To pay attention to the largest 
worldwide political event in recent history, he said, would be like 
governing by focus group.

<p>Of course, political movements -- people coming together because of shared 
principles to try to affect public policy -- are not quite like focus 
groups, which are convened by folks in advertising and marketing to test
out their pitches. Demonstrations are real democratic expressions of the
strong commitments of people; focus groups are a research tool used to 
craft manipulative slogans and advertising strategies in order to subvert 
real democracy. But let's put aside the president's confusion and go back 
to his assessment of how the system should work:

<p>"The role of a leader is to decide policy based upon the security -- in 
this case, the security of the people," Bush said.

<p>That's all well and good, but beside the point. The question is, does Bush 
think "the people" have any ideas about their own security that are worth 
considering?
