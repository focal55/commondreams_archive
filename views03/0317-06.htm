<p>The emperor has spoken. Let the world take heed.

<p>Mark the date: March 16, 2003. It will go down in history as the day our
new Caesar crossed his personal Rubicon. Bush's twin ultimata, to Iraq and 
to the United Nations, constituted the final and ultimate declaration of
the new New World Order.
<p>The first formal declaration was in his speech to Congress on September 20, 
2001. "Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you 
are with us, or you are with the terrorists." The open implication was that 
the rule of law, already honored mostly in the breach, was to be replaced 
by the rule of force; that force, naturally, to emanate from Washington.
<p>Over the 1.5 years since then, there have been numerous reaffirmations
-- 
the launching of the pre-emption doctrine, the warning to the UN that if it 
didn't do America's bidding it would make itself "irrelevant" -- but it was 
always possible to imagine that even this reckless administration might be 
turned back, might at least at least generate an illusion of a velvet glove 
in which to cloak its iron fist.
<p>No more. Bush's declaration was crafted to lock in the insane and 
potentially suicidal course that the administration has taken ever since
the attacks of 9/11.
<p>What was really shocking and terrifying was not simply the effective 
declaration of war against Iraq; it has been a foregone conclusion for at 
least six months that, in the absence of overwhelming opposition, the war 
would happen. Rather, it was the way the ultimatum was delivered. To give 
Iraq 24 hours to "disarm" (even while Dick Cheney and Colin Powell make the 
rounds of talk TV saying there is no longer a way for Iraq to comply) is
openly farcical. An administration that took a year after 9/11 before it
instituted widespread X-raying of checked bags might be expected to 
understand this. To give the Security Council 24 hours to pass a resolution 
is a naked imperial imposition.
<p>It is an ultimatum designed not to elicit any response, but rather to 
humiliate.
<p>It is also perhaps worth commenting on the stunningly open mendacity of the 
Bush administration, continued with Bush's ultimatum yesterday. To make 
this declaration on the 15th anniversary of the gassing of Halabja, to 
mention it specifically, is a profound insult not just to the Iraqi people 
but to all of us; where is the mention that the United States supported 
Iraq fully at the time, with biological and chemical materials, loan 
guarantees, and diplomatic cover? That it went so far as to issue organized 
disinformation (<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0117-01.htm" target="_new">http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0117-01.htm</a>)
suggesting 
that Iran was the culprit? To mention Rwanda as an example of the "failure" 
of the UN was possibly even worse. Again, where was the mention that the UN 
"failed" because the United States kept UN peacekeepers from being 
reinforced, cut off their supplies, and pushed ceaselessly to have them 
removed? Or the mention that the State Department deliberately covered up 
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/press.html" target="_new">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/press.html</a>) its clear 
knowledge that what was happening was genocide?
<p>Indeed, it is again as if these references were added simply to display 
flagrant contempt for the rest of the world, which may know the truth but 
consistently feels unable to express it because of the weight of U.S. coercion.
<p>And perhaps the most important lie was the reference to France. France has 
"shown its cards" and "said they were going to veto anything that held 
Saddam to account" -- this right on the heels of Chirac's effective 
surrender by agreeing to a 30-day deadline for disarmament.
<p>This was is much bigger than a war on Iraq. It is a gauntlet hurled in the 
face of France and the rest of "old Europe." It is a frontal assault on the 
concept of democracy worldwide. It is, if you look at the planning 
documents (<a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org" target="_new">http://www.newamericancentury.org</a>) of the neoconservatives who 
now run our foreign policy, the first stage in a long campaign against China.
<p>Yesterday, Bush drew the battle lines through the entire globe and through 
the middle of each country. In order even to begin to understand how to 
oppose this new imperialism, we must understand this: weapons of mass 
destruction have nothing to do with this war, and even Iraq itself has to 
do with this war only in the sense that it is a strategic prize. This war 
is a small part of an ongoing attempt to reshape the world.
<p>The target of this war is not Iraq. The target is the entire world order, 
and Iraq is simply collateral damage.
