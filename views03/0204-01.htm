<p>WASHINGTON -- </br>
  </i>LARRY LINDSEY was basically correct. The former White House economic policy chief, removed after last fall's elections for excessive candor in public, had tried to put the cost of an impending invasion of Iraq in broad outline and offered a range of $100 billion to $200 billion. The White House suggested that Lindsey's guesstimating was wildly excessive.
<P>

   Now, however, it is beginning to look sensible.
<P>

   The budget proposal released yesterday by President Bush pretends that no war is imminent, a superficially rational approach before the fact. In the last week, however, an assumption like that has come to seem fanciful at best as the drumbeat for invasion has become deafening, with virtually no hints that it is avoidable.
<P>

   For that reason, quite apart from the rosy assumptions and radical proposals that permeate the rest of Bush's 13-pound document drop, the president's proposal is virtually useless as a clue to how badly ruined the country's public finances are likely to be.
<P>

   With the possibility of fighting within a month, the most likely congressional action on the budget in the short term is no action at all. Bush may have been obligated by law to make his proposal, but congressional  leaders in both parties will be loath to do much until they have some idea if an invasion is around the corner. The controversial proposals for more tax cuts and restraints on domestic programs will make little sense in Congress until everything can be put on the table. As it is, even without any idea of the Iraq bill, the government is poised to run record deficits exceeding $300 billion for the next two years, even if the economy returns to a solid growth path.
<P>

   The outlook, however, is certain to get worse. The administration is already poised to come back with a supplemental spending request for the war on terrorism of at least $15 billion in a few months.
<P>

   In addition, administration officials have begun saying that should there be an invasion of Iraq soon, its one-year cost will likely approximate the $60 billion-plus expended on the last Persian Gulf War 12 years ago. That cost, however, was mostly picked up by pliant oil-producing and Asian countries anxious to see the oil from occupied Kuwait start flowing again.
<P>

   This time, the cost is almost certain to fall almost entirely on the United States, and even if postinvasion oil revenues from Iraq (assuming the country's oil fields survive intact) are applied to occupation and reconstruction bills, the cost of war and its aftermath will still be huge. Whether that burden is borne entirely by the United States remains to be seen, but without more allies the outlook is grim.
<P>

   The Bush administration did not just leave any indication of what war in Iraq might entail out of its budget presentation yesterday. It is also a subject officials refuse to discuss even privately.
<P>

   It's easy to understand why by examining a nearly ignored study done more than two months ago by the nonpartisan staff of the Congressional Budget Office, which in effect provided more substantive background for Lindsey's estimate.
<P>

   Just to give an indication of a low-end cost, the CBO assumed a war of very short duration, heavy on the bombing, relatively light on the ground troops, lasting about a month, with no occupation costs at all, and came up with a figure of $21.1 billion. The force involved would nonetheless be substantial: two-and-a-third Army divisions, one-third of a Marine division, 10 Air Force fighter wings, 72 bombers, six Navy and Marine air wings, and 60 ships.
<P>

   More realistically, it also included a heavier ground operation and three months of combat, and came up with a figure of about $44 billion, due mostly to the assumption of five Army divisions and a full Marine division.
<P>

   The wild card is the cost of occupying the country after the fighting has stopped. Depending on the size of the occupying force -- 75,000 to 200,000 people --  the CBO estimated five-year costs from just under $100 billion to more than $270 billion. That should be viewed as conservative, because few experts believe that five years is enough time to do the job right; and no one knows how much additional money a reconstruction program would cost.
<P>

   With these kinds of numbers in the background, Congress would be nuts to do very much with the president's proposal until the spring. If there is an invasion, however, those same numbers make his tax cut proposals appear even more preposterous.
<P>

   It is one thing to propose $1.3 trillion in additional tax cuts on top of the $1.6 trillion enacted two years ago. But it is beyond irresponsible to do so in the face of the largest two looming deficits in American history, deficits that so far do not include a single dollar for a looming invasion of Iraq.
