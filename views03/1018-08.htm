<p>An escalating spiral of bloodshed in the Mideast is careening out of 
control.  Much of it involves U.S. personnel and weapons.  They are paid for
partly with the economic surplus created by the American people, themselves 
under attack in capital's one-sided class war against them.

<p>Some Americans, like me, oppose the politically connected who represent such
wealth.  Not in private, but in public.  As one of these working folks who 
were born into (but not practicing) the Jewish faith, I have a choice to 
make concerning U.S. policy in the Mideast.

<p>I can be mute.  I can play it safe.  I can conform.

<p>Or I can speak out. I can take a principled stand against U.S.-led war and 
the human suffering it causes to civilians abroad and in America.  I can 
join with other Americans of all backgrounds to demand that our government 
reduce its presence in the Mideast.

<p>In that way, we are trying to reverse the rising cycle of violence plaguing 
the energy-rich region, and turning America into a garrison nation.  An 
unclear number of us think and proceed accordingly.  We are still getting 
our political legs, learning by doing so.

<p>A couple of years ago I penned a piece in a local alternative weekly that 
criticized U.S. Israel policy.  I focused partly on the military inequality 
between the state of Israel and the Palestinian people living under a harsh 
occupation.  A co-worker quite outside the anti-war choir I am part of gave 
me some feedback.

<p>"I read your article," she said.

<p>"What did you think of it?" I replied.

<p>"Interesting."

<p>I thanked her.  She then continued with negative comments about the 
Palestinian people.  My point?

<p>She and many Americans of all backgrounds are lied to from birth about U.S.
foreign policy.  It is a propaganda blitzkrieg, a culture of misinformation 
from school to work.  This has bred deception, including the demonization of
official American enemies.

<p>Today the enemies are the Palestinians.  Tomorrow the foes will be the 
Syrians.  And then or at the same time the Iranians will be evil incarnate.

<p>Deceptive editorializing and reporting on the Mideast, petrol station to the
rich nations, has shaped public opinion dramatically in America.  Consider 
the slanted focus on Islamic  fundamentalism.  In contrast, Judeo-Christian 
fundamentalism gets a wink and a nod, unless you read Sara Diamond and other
radical writers.

<p>My co-worker was not likely a part of the fantastic Feb. 15 pro-peace 
demonstrations against the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.  But she and millions 
of others like her could be.  And that must be one of our goals.

<p>Such poorly informed working folks, in unions or not, will need to be so 
engaged around war and peace to continue the historic shift of Americans' 
national identity.  It is marked, in my view, by an emerging desire to 
settle national disputes without the maiming and murdering of civilians.  
Peace with justice is not just a slogan.

<p>Americans by and large expect federal and state lawmakers to protect them 
and respond to their wishes.  Angry California voters who just helped to 
elect an action film star to be the new governor in a recall vote are proof 
of working people's longing for a "change in government."  What actions Mr. 
Schwarzenneger does or does not take against striking grocery and transit 
workers in Los Angeles will show what he means by "change."

<p>In the meantime, it is becoming more clear with each passing day that the 
occupation of Iraq and Palestine is an imperial quagmire.  Tens of billions 
of tax dollars from working people in the U.S. are making the Mideast less 
safe by funding the proxy forces of the Israeli government, the regional 
bonecrusher.  Meanwhile in America, state and local governments are going 
broke, widening income inequality as social programs are slashed.

<p>This process has left in its wake many hurt and hurting Americans. Some of 
them are being made redundant by an economy that is recovering without 
creating new jobs.  And those who have jobs are being pressed by their 
bosses to work harder, creating much stress and tension.

<p>Government spending priorities are not cast in concrete but are up for 
grabs.  On that note, Americans do not have to be skateboards for imperial 
power.  The daily carnage in occupied Iraq and Palestine claiming the lives 
of the native population and U.S. personnel provides ample examples of what 
humanity must steer clear of to avoid further chaos and conflagrations.
