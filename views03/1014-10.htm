<p>I am typing this list immediately after hearing on television about somebody actually shoving a man to the ground in a baseball game at Boston! The violence of it!

<p>On another station, there was adoration about a baseball pitcher with the Florida Marlins team, who at the age of 23, Lord, imagine anybody that young performing under a nation's glare? Looked the enemy in the eye and went the entire nine innings and shut out the Chicago team. What courage! What a deep well of physical strength and stamina!

<p>This column today is about young men who were playing in another world. You can find the names in virtually no other place. Obscure people dying in obscurity. The Pekinese of the Press do not feel dead soldiers are worth mentioning. Only the guy next to them knew what they were made of.

<p>The last time I listed dead from Iraq, there were nine names. I went to California and returned to find faxes from the Department of Defense telling of many more. They are victims of George Bush's serial lying. It is his duty, and one that he shirks, to get up and read these names to a country distracted by a game for boys. Herewith the names, not including the three most recent, whose names are not yet available. We apologize that the manner of death seems repetitious but these wars happen to come out like this:
