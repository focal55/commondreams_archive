<p>JOHNSTOWN, PA. -- This is fertile ground for recruitment.

<p>The offices are in a shopping mall outside this once-thriving coal city that is instantly recognizable to Canadians as the rundown mill setting for Slap Shot, the Paul Newman film that has such a cult following among hockey fans.

<p>Air Force, Navy, Marines and Army recruitment offices -- all in a row, all with their enticing posters on the windows and brochures in the stands.

<p>"Be A Soldier in an Army of One."

<p>"Take the Path Few Have the Courage to Take."

<p>"Become one of The Few. The Proud. Do that, and there's nothing in the world that can stop you."

<p>Of course, this isn't quite true: a bullet can stop you, or an accident, or a suicide bomb. In the first 19 days of the war in Iraq, the Pentagon says the U.S.A. lost 88 men and women, a far cry from the 200 a week that were dying in the worst days of the Vietnam War and fewer, so far, than the total of 146 who were lost in the Persian Gulf war.

<p>These 88 deaths, carried on 24-hour news programs and covered intensely by the print media from first word to burial, have not, however, deterred the recruitment process -- at least not in Johnstown.

<p>"If anything, it's up," says Matt Ronan, the 24-year-old non-commissioned officer in charge of Marine recruitment.

<p>The marines, as expected, have been involved in the most dangerous missions of the war and have, naturally, suffered multiple casualties. Marines have been front and center in the coverage, the heroes one day, the sad and poignant reports of tragedy the next -- and yet still the young men and women come in through the front door.

<p>"We'll have two or three come in today who will say 'I want to go to war. I want to kill people,' " says Ronan.

<p>"We'll talk to them, but after the screening process, they won't be recruited. They're not the ones we want."

<p>Both recruiters present admit to a frustration with their assignment in that they, too, would rather be involved in the actual fight.

<p>"I feel like I'm riding the bench," says 30-year-old Sergeant John Conley.

<p>Almost everywhere in America a visitor goes, there is this eagerness among the young to get involved. In Wheeling, W.Va., two 12-year-old Young Marines say they would happily do whatever their country asks of them. In rural Palestine, W.Va., the 18-year-old sister of Jessica Lynch, the soldier who was so dramatically rescued a week ago, says she, too, is joining up to be like her older sister and brother.

<p>"The army," says Brandi Lynch, "needs more Lynches."

<p>Only one young man along this journey, 18-year-old Jason Leifester of Comfort, Tex., seems uncertain -- and with reason. His best friend, James Kiehl, was one of those lost with Lynch's maintenance unit and has since been listed as "killed in action."

<p>He will not volunteer, he says, but "I'll go if I have to."

<p>Something profound has happened to America in this conflict. After 18 American soldiers were lost in Somalia 10 years ago, it was widely perceived that the public had lost its tolerance for casualties in war.

<p>But the war on terrorism has raised that tolerance. There has even been talk of returning to a universal draft, something that has not been in existence since 1973 and was the cause of such bitterness during the Vietnam era.

<p>The oddity today is that the ones in favor of some form of draft tend to be doves, while hawks prefer to stay with the voluntary service.

<p>Those who criticize the current system say it leans too heavily on the lower classes. Peace groups like to say that only four members of the U.S. Congress have children in the military.

<p>They say it is wrong to have a professional blue-collar military -- which some even refer to as a "warrior caste."

<p>Others say that a volunteer force is a superior fighting force, that today's soldiers are better trained and more dependable.

<p>Representative Charles Rangel of New York and Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina have both talked about a return to the draft, but for quite different reasons.

<p>Rangel, a Democrat and decorated combat veteran from the Korean War, is opposed to the Iraqi conflict but argues a universal draft is necessary because, "The affluent are not doing their share."

<p>Hollings, a Republican and a combat veteran of the Second World War, supports the Iraqi war but believes conscription can serve a useful purpose rarely considered.

<p>"You will find," he has said, "that this country will sober up -- and its leadership, too."

<p>The two Johnstown Marine recruiters are not convinced by either argument.

<p>"I don't think there's any need for a draft," Ronan says.

<p>"Unless after this North Korea starts up," adds Conley.

<p>"If that happens, you never know."
