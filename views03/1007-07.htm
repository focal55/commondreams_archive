<p>Here is a thought experiment. Suppose you had run for president of the United States and had lost the popular vote but managed to take office because of (for you) a lucky electoral anomaly. In other words, you have assumed office knowing that more people voted for your opponent than for you.
<p>How would you govern? Would you try to keep your principles while striking a moderate pose, realizing that you had a nation to unite? If the country was attacked by murderous thugs, would you seek the help of the international community? Would you search for a balance between competing interests on taxation, jobs, the deficit, the environment, health care, education, media consolidation, corporate crime and the budget? Would you be humble and cognizant of your limitations? Would you surround yourself with those of different viewpoints and backgrounds, representing the diversity and smarts of the greatest country in the world?
<p>Or - would you decide that because you were now in charge, whatever you thought was right and you would govern the way you pleased? Would you take steps that you knew would isolate and divide the nation?
<p>It is not at all unreasonable to assume that the vast majority of Americans would choose the first course. That's because most Americans have a sense of fairness and moderation. But that is the opposite of what President Bush has done. He has deliberately ignored millions of voices in the name of a strange ideology - strange because the notion of extremism is alien to a large majority of Americans.
<p>Bush's course is so unusual that he has even turned his back on the positions of members of his own party.
<p>For example:
<ul>
<li>More than 90 percent of Americans say they are against the recent media consolidation vehemently backed by Bush;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A vast majority of Americans oppose destructive environmental policies that Bush supports;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The corporation-friendly Bush wants to eliminate overtime pay for as many as 8 million people, a proposal opposed by most workers;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most Americans say we needed the exact kind of international cooperation that Bush resisted in the Iraq war.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For some, this resoluteness is Bush's strength. Some believe that his steadfast hand is a virtue, and, indeed, in some cases that can be what is needed in trying times.
<p>But what is astonishing about this administration is the consistency of its single-mindedness - it frequently pursues extreme policies, without compromise, to be imposed at its will. These policies may be popular on right-wing radio and cable networks. But their very popularity among these audiences defines their remoteness from the notions of a vast majority of the American people.
<p>You need not be a liberal to oppose Bush's vision of America. You don't even have to be a moderate. You can be a conservative and find reason for alarm in reckless budgeting, abuses of civil rights and go-it-alone warfare. 
It is not that Bush is too conservative to lead America - in fact, his policies are contrary to conservative ideals. Simply put, Bush has taken an extremist course of government while deliberately and coldly ignoring those who want nothing more than to make sure America remains as great as it is.
