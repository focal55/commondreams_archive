<p>Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, the public assistance program for poor mothers and their children, is up for reauthorization by Congress.

<p>Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services is touting figures showing that in the last year the number of recipients has declined by 4.3 percent since March 2002. The Bush administration's proposal for reauthorization, which has been passed by the House of Representatives and awaits Senate action, would increase work requirements for mothers of young children to up to 40 hours per week and increase participation rates to 70 percent of the caseload.

<p>It also would allow only up to three months in any two-year period to be used to overcome obstacles to employment, such as post-high school education or training, mental health, drug counseling or domestic violence programs. Moreover, the funding level is inadequate for additional child-care needed if the work hours and participation levels are increased.

<p>Although an assistant HHS secretary, Wade F. Horn, says that "full-time work is the best route out of poverty," the most recent Census Bureau report found that the number of Americans living below the poverty level (which is less than $18,300 for a family of four) increased in the last year to 12.4 percent of the population - almost 38 million people. The increase in children under 5 living in poverty increased to 19.8 percent.

<p>In August, the number of jobs lost nationwide totaled 93,000. Indeed, in the last three years, the United States has experienced the greatest job loss since the start of the Great Depression. Since the beginning of the latest recession, March 2001, this nation has lost 2 percent of its jobs. New York State has fared even worse - losing over 3 percent of its jobs.

<p>There seems to be a disconnect between proposed policies and the reality. If more people, even those working, are poor, and fewer jobs are available, does it make sense to require women - often with few skills, lack of education and other barriers - to leave their children for long hours of work?

<p>If they are unable to find real jobs, which is increasingly the situation, they are forced into "workfare." They are required to work, without pay - just for their meager TANF benefits - long hours at make-work jobs while their children risk being without proper supervision. If they refuse their assignments, they risk being thrown off the rolls or at least having their monthly allowance reduced.

<p>During TANF's first six years, when jobs were growing and the economy was expanding, many did leave welfare for jobs. But, even then, the average wage was only $7.10 per hour, not enough to pull a mother and her children out of poverty, even if she could work full-time. With the economic downturn, these last hired are often first fired. Many of their jobs were part-time or temporary, so they often become unemployed. Studies show that only about two-thirds of those leaving welfare were working after six months. Now, in states like Illinois, about half those leaving or kicked off welfare are not working.

<p>Even working full-time, families might be off welfare, but still be unable to be "economically independent" and support their families. The same Census report also found that in the last year households on Food Stamps increased from 6.4 million to 6.8 million.

<p>So, if more families and children are poor and there are fewer jobs available, how is it that the welfare rolls continue to decline? It's no surprise, because there is now a maximum five-year lifetime limit for families receiving temporary assistance. In some states the limit is only two or three years. What that means is that even if former recipients who found jobs later lose them, they may no longer be able to return to welfare.

<p>The decline in the rolls is in part a result that they are no longer eligible to be on the rolls. Another reason for the decline is that recipients are sanctioned for infractions of rules. In a study conducted in Suffolk County a few years ago, we found that one-third of recipients had been sanctioned at least once, for such reasons as not showing up for an appointment. Sanctions range from a reduction in the monthly grant, to removal from the rolls.


<p>This is no reason to celebrate a decline in the welfare rolls. Instead, what we need is a bill that allows recipients to use education and training as a work activity so they can qualify for decent paying jobs, to provide funds for child care and to exempt from the work requirements women who are caring for infants or disabled family members.

<p>If we are serious about moving families out of poverty, and not just off welfare, then we need to roll back the tax refunds for the richest Americans (who are getting over $70,000 in one year) and use these funds to create needed jobs in rebuilding the infrastructure, for more teacher aides, and in homeland security. Then we can hire low-income people in these real jobs so they can be free not only of welfare, but of poverty.
