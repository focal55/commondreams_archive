<p>President Bush recently announced that he wants to expand federal funding 
for school services to help low-income children.  Yet the $1 billion of his 
proposed new funds for these kids amounts to less than a single day of 
military spending.  Regardless, the Los Angeles Times reported that such
"education reform" is a "signature issue" backed by Democrats and 
Republicans.

<p>Political differences do exist, however.  Some Democrats have responded that 
the president's proposed funding increase for poor students falls far short 
of what's needed.  This qualifies as the understatement of the young new
year.
<p>Both parties supported the No Child Left Behind Act that Bush signed on Jan. 
8, 2002.  The NCLBA partly allocates funds to low-income families to move 
their children from inferior to superior schools.  The funding is also 
available to pay tutors for after-school instruction.
<p>Yet if educational opportunity was more than a word used to dupe the public, 
Congress and the president could have transferred tens of billions of 
taxpayer dollars from the Pentagon for Star Wars to public schools for 
smaller class sizes.  But that was not to be.  So goes the politics of 
education reform in the U.S.
<p>Puzzling?  The nation's political circles of power have their priorities.  
High on the list is fully funding the Pentagon, not public schools.
<p>The absence of evidence that military spending is more socially useful than 
education spending is evidence of the absence of critical journalism on 
these two subjects.  To be sure, exceptions to this sorry state of affairs 
do exist.  Regrettably, they are too few to shape public opinion much.
<p>Concerning the NCLBA, the LA Times article noted that, "Some critics have 
said that approach emphasizes standardized testing at the expense of 
instructional time and imposes unfair penalties on problem schools." Bush 
disagreed, shifting the criticism to unchanging schools where teachers fail 
students.  "Instead of getting excuses, parents will now get choices," he 
said.
<p>Particularly, market choices are what await these parents.  The Republican 
White House and Congress firmly back the competition of the marketplace as 
the path to social improvement.  Presumably, the GOP's mission to level the 
educational playing field by removing market fetters will unleash the 
untapped learning potential of poor students.
<p>Positive education results, we can be sure, will follow the mandatory math 
and reading tests, given annually by states, to needy students in the third 
through eighth grades under the NCLBA.  This testing requirement begins in 
fall 2005.  Then, states will be able to determine which students are
(not) learning their lessons.
<p>Such testing is "the only way" to make accurate educational evaluations,
according to the president.  One standardized test fits all.  More 
marketization of education means more standardization in public schools.

<p>The LA Times article also reported that the Bush administration has boosted 
total federal expenditures on public education to $22 billion, a 40 percent 
increase, for the current instructional year.  Crucially, this overall 
amount of public school spending pales in comparison to the current Pentagon 
budget of about $400 billion.  Here are two public programs that receive
disproportionate amounts of tax dollars, but aren't generally reported in 
relation to each other.

<p>The contrast between the two programs is stark.  Accordingly, the political 
priorities are self-evident once people are informed.  To this end, they
need journalists with independent news media to buck the conventional wisdom 
and give the business of war more than a wink and a nod.

<p>Meanwhile, low-income households are being used as pawns by political power 
interested in scoring points around reform of the nation's underfunded 
public schools.  But the marketization of education is no more a solution to 
the substandard schools that poor U.S. kids attend than "smart bombs" are 
the tools to liberate the Iraq people from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.  
Many in the U.S. would no doubt vote to transfer their taxes from the 
Pentagon to public schools if the politics of education reform was made 
clearer.
