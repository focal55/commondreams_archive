	</a> It seems to be no coincidence that Iraqi songs are invariably melancholic and sad. The justification, Iraqis say, is that &quot;our history is rife with injustices.&quot; Their future does not seem to be more promising.<p>On the eve of the UN arms inspectors' second report to the United Nations, and with America apparently determined to attack Iraq no matter what, the Iraqis seem to face further injustices that may be more horrifying than anything that has so far befallen them.<p>From the beginning of time Iraq has offered humanity some of its richest civilizations. It is the land of Mesopotamia and of the Code of Hammurabi, the oldest human law. To the people of the region, it is baffling that Iraq - whose people had been renowned as the best readers in the Arab world and which produces the best intellects - should become a testing ground for the latest missiles and weaponry.<p>To speak only of Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime is to ignore more than 20 million Iraqi people whose lives have been reduced to a subhuman level by the cruel and unfair sanctions that have been imposed on the country. Iraq has not only oil but also civilization, a rich history and a people who will be irreparably harmed if a war is launched against their country.<p>The international community, including the American people, has expressed poignantly its opposition to a war. I would like to pay tribute in particular to the relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks who came all the way to Baghdad to express their rejection of the war option. One of them said, &quot;I lost my brother in the attacks of Sept. 11, and I do not want any human being to suffer such a loss.&quot;<p>This is what our humanity represents at its best. If only the American government could rise up to the example of the citizens it is supposed to represent and save Iraq, the region and the entire humanity the devastating consequences of unnecessary aggression.<p>Most people of the region feel that the Bush administration behaves as if the Middle East is a region without people, or as if its people are without human rights and as if their lives, security and sovereign rights are worth nothing but to satisfy certain ideological designs that are in the minds of some leaders in Washington.<p>The statements of President George W. Bush and some of his senior officials in this regard have invited both amazement and anger. It was baffling to watch Bush threaten the United Nations that it will become insignificant if it doesn't support his war against Iraq - as if he had forgotten that the United Nations is an expression of international will.<p>UN inspectors are still doing positive work and their statements indicate that Iraq is cooperating. The Bush administration has called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis over North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so what is the rationale behind its rush to disarm Iraq by carrying out a military attack?<p>People in the Arab world see the discrepancy in the U.S. attitudes to Iraq and to North Korea as yet more proof that the Bush administration is moved by religious hatred toward Arabs. It is also strongly believed here that Israel is the driving force behind the unjustified plan to attack Iraq, especially as the lack of respect that Israel has always shown to the role of the United Nations is slowly but steadily leaking into statements by senior American officials.<p>No one here believes that the Bush administration is coming to modernize or democratize or bring in better political systems. After all, the policy of successive U.S. administrations played a vital role in supporting the same regimes that it describes as undemocratic or dictatorial.<p>If the Bush administration wants to be viewed as fair in the region, it should support UN resolutions concerning the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and take a stand against the Israeli occupation and settlements - and Israel's killing of Palestinian women and children, and destruction of houses - rather than give Prime Minister Ariel Sharon a free hand to spill so much Palestinian blood.<p>Sharon's strategy, which has plunged Palestinians and Israelis into a cycle of violence unprecedented in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, has brought nothing but pain to both sides. Now the Bush administration, on the basis of a strategy similar to Sharon's, is on the verge of infecting the entire region with the same kind of violence and counterviolence.<p>If it goes to war, in other words, the United States may inadvertently unleash an Arab-American or even a Muslim-American conflict - with unpredictable and, in all likelihood, uncontainable consequences.
