<p>From the electronic sidelines, I’ve been following debates between progressive friends concerning Dean and Kucinich. Dean’s not a true progressive, says one camp. Kucinich is not electable, says the other. 

<p>Here’s what I think: Dean is running a remarkable, history-making campaign. He’s opened it up to the grassroots in a way that will fundamentally change campaigns forever. He’s showing that Democrats can raise campaign funds in a spirit true to Democratic ideals, instead of aping Republican tactics. Dean has given voters the sense that they can participate in his campaign and their voices will be heard. He’s allowed them into the “smoke-filled backroom” of his political campaign. That in itself says something significant about the candidate. 

<p>Meanwhile, Kucinich is out on the stump articulating things that Democrats need to hear. Democrats aren’t a slightly more liberal version of Republicans. They invented the social programs that make for a compassionate, civilized society! Now that very society is under attack. Democrats must get out and defend those social programs and everything for which they stand. Kucinich is doing so with courage. And his personal experience of childhood poverty informs his every word.

<p>But best of all, Dean and Kucinich are only two of nine candidates in this race. We should celebrate the wealth of talent we find in the lineup. Carol Mosley Braun, while running a shoestring campaign, speaks articulately on the issues and carries herself with dignity. Graham is an experienced elected official from the South (still thought by some to be of critical importance), who stood up to Bush regarding the attack on Iraq. Kerry, too, is an intelligent, honorable, experienced politician with an impeccable military record. Sharpton has a way of saying exactly the right thing at the right time, and does so with surprising sensitivity toward his Democratic opponents. Gephardt has years of political leadership experience, yet still managed to maintain connection with people who work for an hourly wage. Edwards (another Southerner) is a young firebrand who fought for the underdog as a trial lawyer and who can rabble-rouse with the best of them. And Lieberman is an earnest, thoughtful man of strong convictions and deep beliefs. 

<p>None of these candidates is perfect—not one. And only one will win the party nomination and (she states with confidence) the presidential election. If you’re a grown-up, you know that no person is perfect. Why, at this stage of the game, denigrate our choices? Can there ever be too much of a good thing? Not when it comes to candidates, surely.

<p>I appreciate each candidate for different reasons. Most of all, I appreciate them for being willing to try, for sending their ideas out to the American people and hoping that some of those ideas catch fire. For signing on for the grueling trek that leads to the White House. For showing that the Democratic Party is still messy and chaotic and full of ideas. What better contrast could we make with the Republicans? Here’s our current line-up: old, young, male, female, Jewish, religious, agnostic, doctor, minister, war hero, rich, middle-class, working-class, African-American, white, northern, southern, conservative, liberal—hey, it looks like America!

<p>And on the Republican team: one middle-aged, white, right-wing, failed businessman—born to a life of privilege, a wastrel in his youth, AWOL from the National Guard when his compatriots were dying in Vietnam—who has completely mucked up every area of executive responsibility. What does that look like—Enron, WorldCom, etc.? Not an America that voters want to see.

<p>Let’s revel in our riches. Let’s be proud of our groaning buffet table laden with a smorgasbord of voices, ideas, and life experiences. Fill your plate with one candidate’s offerings or spoon up a little from each. But take your time; don’t rush to digest. And don’t turn your nose up at a dish you haven’t tried. This meal’s a long one; in the end, everyone will get his or her just deserts.
