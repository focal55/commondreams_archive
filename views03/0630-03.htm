<p>The vaunted US "road map" to peace lies battered in a
series of attacks that claimed dozens of lives this
month alone. By embracing the concept of "pre-emptive assassination," the United States seems determined to follow the Middle East down the same bloody path. 

<p>The White House predictably responded to recent clashes
by denouncing Palestinian suicide bombers; less
predictably, Bush also criticized Israel's botched
attempt to assassinate a senior Hammas leader, which
ended up instead killing three bystanders and setting
off the fresh wave of violence. 

<p>Labeling the pre-emptive assassination strike a
"troubling" blow to peace, Bush later bowed to pressure
from pro-Israel lobbying groups and Congress members;
White House opinion now firmly backs the Sharon
government's crackdown on militant groups, covert
lethal operations and all. 

<p>No wonder. Eager to follow Sharon's lead in
pre-emptively bumping off enemies, the Bush
administration is said to be working with Israeli
government officials to establish the legal framework
for creating America's own targeted-assassination
policy. The Israeli justification (that ongoing
conflict in the West Bank and Gaza Strip necessitates substituting warfare laws for self-defense) sits well with a US president hoping to fight a never-ending "war on terror." 

<p>Coincidence? The Israeli attorney-general's office
calls "legal and legitimate" the systematic elimination
of almost 100 Palestinian militants (not to mention
innocent bystanders) since the intifada broke out in
late 2000. The US State Department similarly defined
its own hit job on an Al-Aqaeda operative in Yemen last November as "legal and necessary."

<p>But pre-emptive assassination strikes are not the Bush administration's only covert method of eliminating enemies. Plans are underway to turn the controversial detention facility at Guantanamo Bay into a full-fledged death camp, equipped with its own death row and execution chamber. 

<p>In direct breach of Geneva Conventions, the United
States has held hundreds of prisoners of war at
Guantanamo, long-term and without charge, some
prisoners as young as 13 years old. But plans have been revealed to try, convict and execute prisoners without a jury or right of appeal. It's a new twist on the concept of pre-emptive assassination: kill POWs so they can't fight you later. 

<p>But the ultimate in pre-emptive assassination was the
recent invasion of Iraq. Claiming America was under
"imminent threat" because of Hussein's supposed WMD
program, the White House invoked a "pre-emptive war"
policy to justify inadvertently killing thousands of
Iraqi civilians. 

<p>Ethical and legal implications aside, it's reckless for
the US to continue pursuing a pre-emptive assassination
policy, in any form. How ironic that US government and political leaders play up their Christianity, yet don't put pre-emptive killing in the obvious biblical
context: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. 

<p>Put bluntly, if the United States can openly murder
foreign POWs, how soon before American POWs are
systematically murdered abroad? If the US can justify
invading another country because of unproven "imminent
threat," how soon before US cities are similarly
attacked? And if pre-emptive assassination deems the
murder of civilians/bystanders abroad acceptable
collateral damage, then how about on US soil? The Bush administration has already tacitly accepted the Sharon government's plan to conduct assassinations in "friendly countries" - presumably including the United States. That's right: <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0116-10.htm">the White House has basically given the green light for Israel to conduct targeted assassinations on US soil</a>. Feeling safer?

<p>At heart is the debate over whether pre-emptive
assassination in any form is justified. Does it support
or sabotage the political process; does it promote
peace or further bloodshed? What proof of guilt should
be required before the White House carries out an assassination; what level of collateral damage is acceptable? Until there has been open and honest debate over the pre-emptive assassination issue, the US government must avoid this dangerous path.
