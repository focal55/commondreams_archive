<p>Who has not clambered onto a bus, headed off to a protest 
demonstration and stood amid sparse company in the rain, thinking, "What's the 
use?" Who has not listened to some plucky orator rasping through a 
bullhorn, "Let our message go forth..." and thought privately, "Forth to 
whom? Who's listening? Who cares?" 
	<P>These days, there's a spirited movement growing across the United 
States opposing a war against Iraq. There have been some big events, like 
the rallies in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, attended by vast 
throngs. But there have also been rallies and vigils by the score in small 
towns. 
	<P>Are they making a difference? 
	<P>Of course they are, just like the demonstrations in Europe, the Middle 
East, Australia and elsewhere. U.S. ambassadors and CIA heads of 
station may deprecate and downplay the world protests in their reports, but 
they cannot dismiss them, any more than can the White House. How can you 
ignore a turnout of 500,000 in Florence? 
	<P>In short, protests count, just as they did in the very earliest days 
of organizing against the war in Vietnam. This organizing was undertaken 
by far-left groups, small Trotskyist and Maoist sects moving far ahead 
of the mainstream. 
	<P>When did these efforts begin? Back in 1963 and even earlier, half a 
decade before the huge throngs began to muster in Washington, D.C. In the 
past few weeks, many veterans of these early marches have been pooling 
their memories. Here's a recollection to me of one of the earliest, 
from Lawrence Reichard, who these days works as an organizer in Stockton, 
Calif., defending rural workers. 
	<P>"In the spring of 1962," Reichard says, "when I was 3 years old, my 
mother dragged me to a demonstration against the U.S. war in Laos in 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa. There were five people at that demo. My mom, my older 
brother, me and two others." Then, "In 1969, I rode in a VW bus from 
Charlotte, N.C., to Washington, D.C., for an anti-war demo that drew 
500,000. According to Daniel Ellsberg, that demo made President Nixon 
reconsider the madman recommendation of his Joints Chiefs of Staff to nuke 
Vietnam within a few miles of the Chinese border." 
	<P>That trip was especially memorable for him, Reichard continues, 
because he made it with the family of Norman Morrison, who immolated himself 
in front of the Pentagon in protest over the war. Reichard recalls that 
he read later that Lyndon B. Johnson's aides cut mention of Morrison's 
death out of his newspapers so he wouldn't see it. 
	<P>"On the rare occasion that I'm asked to speak at a demo, and the 
turnout is low," Reichard concludes, "I speak about the turnout in Cedar 
Rapids and the turnout in D.C. years later, as a way to rally the troops 
and lift spirits. Imperialism and colonialism are not stopped in a day!" 
He points out that "it is also noteworthy that in 1954 or 1955 the 
American Friends Service Committee wrote a letter to the Eisenhower 
administration warning against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Needless to say, 
the anti-war movement of today is way ahead of the movement that brought 
out five demonstrators in Cedar Rapids in the early '60s." 
	<P>Reichard ended thus, "The anti-war movement has much to be proud of. 
To the absolute fury of the right wing, the anti-war movement of 
yesterday and today still, to this day, shackles this country's ability to 
wage unfettered war. Right off the bat, they have to forget about any war 
that might last more than six months or cost more than a few hundred 
U.S. lives. For this, you can thank the peace movement and the 
Vietnamese, who, at tremendous cost, beat us militarily. The entire world owes a 
tremendous debt to the Vietnamese."</i></p>
