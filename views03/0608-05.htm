<p>Good news for all of you anxiety sufferers out there! Are you are 
stressed, upset or depressed over the current state of our democracy? 
Worried about the complete breakdown of logic, and the absence of 
compassion on the part of our government? Do you lie awake at night, 
worrying about your job, your future, your retirement, lack of health 
care, and permanent war? Do you fear a worldwide backlash as a result 
of America's belligerent foreign policy? Upset at the loss of your 
civil rights at home?

<p>These worries, and many more like them, can soon be a thing of the 
past.

<p>Yes my friends, through an amazing new application of existing 
medical technology, in combination with major advances in control and 
dissemination of information, you can completely eliminate all worry 
about the blatant totalitarian nature of our government, freeing you 
to blissfully accept, and even embrace, the march towards fascism!

<p>Sound simple? It is! How many of you have hoped and prayed for relief 
from these well founded and difficult to suppress worries? How many 
of you have attempted to drown those nagging fears by immersing 
yourselves in ultra- nationalist patriotic displays? You've tried 
flag waving and unquestioning support of authority figures. You've 
tried to conquer your own fears by trying to silence and intimidate 
others whose questioning of these trends has made you feel 
uncomfortable, vulnerable, and frightened.

<p>If you are like many Americans, you have done all of the things 
described above but it just isn't enough. With each new revelation 
about the inconsistencies, lies, and disinformation foisted upon us 
by our government, that nagging sense of worry returns. Despite your 
best efforts to ignore the truth, and to listen only to sources that 
support your illusions, you are still troubled by the fact 
that "news" stories like the Jessica Lynch rescue tale are now 
revealed (by our closest ally and even by our own corporate press) to 
be nothing but manufactured lies. You still have difficulty 
overlooking your government's multiple violations of international 
law, resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians. Or 
perhaps the fruitless search for the all important, but apparently 
nonexistent Weapons of Mass Destruction has gotten you down.

<p>If you, like millions of others, still suffer from anxiety over these 
troubling events, the time has come to take decisive action. You can 
put all such worries out of your mind once and for all. At long last 
there is an affordable new treatment that utilizes the best elements 
of medical science, psychology and corporate engineered mind control. 
Now you can achieve guaranteed, permanent results, with very little 
effort, and minimal expense. Now, you too can have your very own, 
FRONTAL LOBOTOMY!

<p>I can already hear you skeptics out there, with questions such as: 
Haven't lobotomies been around for decades? What's so fresh and new 
about this idea? Isn't brain surgery a bit extreme? Since I already 
watch FOX News and read the New York Times, why would I need a 
lobotomy? Wouldn't it be redundant?

<p>Read on, silent sufferers, because this is the only product on the 
market today with the power to put your mind completely at ease. 
Don't allow your fear to stand in the way of its cure.

<p>The Lobotomy has been around for a number of years, but its 
therapeutic potential has been limited by a reluctance on the part of 
practitioners to expand its use to treat common anxiety. But our 
cutting-edge research indicates that eliminating the area of the 
brain that carries out analytical functions is the only foolproof way 
to eradicate the cognitive dissonance caused by awareness of the huge 
discrepancy between reality and pro government corporate propaganda.

<p>Think about it. If you no longer have the capacity for rational 
thought, no longer have the ability to discern fact from fiction, you 
will be free to live a hassle free, happy life. You will be 
unconcerned with the annoying and petty details of life, free from 
the burden of having to distinguish between right and wrong. Only 
then can you be truly free to wholeheartedly support unspeakable 
atrocities committed by your government and paid for with your tax 
dollars.

<p>Sure, corporate media is doing its part to exclude any mention of 
stories that might disturb your peace of mind. And in the wake of the 
recent FCC decision to allow further media consolidation in the hands 
of ultra right wing billionaires, like Rupert Murdoch, you can expect 
even more disturbing news to disappear from the headlines. But can 
you really expect corporate media to do the whole job? 

<p>We maintain that it is too much to ask that government and corporate 
manipulation of information provide you with all of the relief you 
seek. For insight into why this is true, you have only to look at a 
few of the basic assumptions that they must sell you before you can 
feel good about your government. Just look at this partial list.

<p>A. Waging unprovoked, preemptive war will preserve peace.

<p>B. The world will be a safer place after America embarks on an 
expensive new arms buildup, constructs new nuclear weapons, attacks 
sovereign foreign nations at will, and demands that all those same 
nations that we are attacking, threatening and arming ourselves 
against, must immediately disarm.

<p>C. Massive tax cuts for billionaires in a time of ballooning 
deficits, while teachers are being laid off nationwide and social 
services are being slashed, will be good for average Americans. The 
extra cash available to people with multimillion dollar annual 
salaries, will be just the money that inspires these billionaires to 
start new businesses. The incredibly large and ever expanding gap 
between rich and poor, has left the super rich perpetually just one 
massive tax cut below the threshold at which they will suddenly be 
inspired to invest in an all-out effort to provide jobs for 
unemployed Americans.

<p>D. Providing Israel with billions of dollars worth of weaponry every 
year and looking the other way while the Israeli government seizes 
Palestinian land, destroys homes and kills civilians, is an essential 
and helpful part of the Peace Process.

<p>E. Concentration of media ownership in the hands of a few 
billionaires will lead to diversity of programming. The concept is 
succinctly expressed by this equation: Monopoly=Diversity

<p>F. Obvious lies are not lies, because you can trust us to be balanced 
and fair.

<p>G. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

<p>Do you see what we are getting at here? You subject corporate media 
in America to highly unreasonable expectations if your hope is that 
they can convince you that your government is acting in your best 
interests. The task, for them, is no less daunting than it would be 
for you to attempt to convince people that pigs can fly.

<p>You have a deeply rooted, even pathological need to feel good about 
your country, and this need already enables you to overlook many 
obvious inconsistencies. But to really feel good, you need be 
absolutely free of worry about the direction chosen for your country 
by your leaders.

<p>Sure, you could resort to time consuming, difficult and frustrating 
political activism, in an effort to improve your country to the point 
where you could feel good about it. But there is a better way. As the 
late John F. Kennedy once so eloquently said, "Ask not what your 
country can do for you, but rather, ask what you can do for your 
country." The answer to that question, my fellow citizens, is simple. 
Get a Lobotomy.

<p>You deserve the peace of mind that only a Lobotomy can give you. And 
all you will have to sacrifice to find that peace, is a small piece 
of your mind.
