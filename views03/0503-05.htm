<p>Last June, there were 2.1 million Americans behind bars.  Out of sight and 
mind?  The answer is yes when it comes to official unemployment figures.

<p>A similar invisibility for the incarcerated was also the case in an April 27 
New York Times report on workers out of a job for increasing periods of 
time.  Those locked up in U.S. jails and prisons were also locked out of

this report.  Talk about perception management of the American economy.

<p>The number of people incarcerated in the nation has quadrupled since the

mid-1970s, the New York Times editorialized on April 9.  Today, the souring 
job market would appear even worse if those held in the American gulag were 
acknowledged as potential workers earning a salary or wage.  But such is not 
the case in government job statistics or flagship corporate media.

<p>To be sure, the incarcerated do work.  It's not called the prison-industrial 
complex for nothing.  Yet even when these human beings do toil outside of 
their cells, they're not officially counted as being employed.

<p>Meanwhile in America since 1973, the working day has increased 199 hours for 
American workers, on average, according to a report last October 24 in the 
NYT, citing data from the International Labor Organization.  During the same 
time period, the unionization rate of private-sector workers has tumbled

sharply as employers and the government have teamed up to beat up on unions. 
  These trends have been a boon for America's Fat Cats.

<p>Their wealth accumulation has expanded almost beyond belief.  This, in turn, 
has rendered a growing section of the nation's work force increasingly 
irrelevant to the U.S. economy.  From Boston to Compton, these are the 
throwaway people, no longer needed to labor for the creation of wealth held 
by a few.

<p>What are the social implications?  Who is (not) asking this crucial 
question?  And why?

<p>Currently, the U.S. economy is floundering.  Some wits have called this a 
"post-bubble" phase of the business cycle, following the hi-tech and stock 
market meltdowns.  In response, President Bush and Congress are fiddling

with the amount of new tax cuts for the super rich, presumably to re-start 
economic growth.

<p>One hears, reads and sees much about the need for business spending to 
increase for job creation to improve.  To be sure, this would help workers 
of all genders and skin colors.  Under a market economy, their labor-power 
is a commodity that is sold and bought, bought and sold, depending on the 
demand for it by business.

<p>This market process is governed by the profitability of the few who own 
society's productive assets such as factories, land and so forth.  Some in 
the GOP might call such an assertion evidence of "class warfare."  But every 
social story has at least two sides to it, and often more than that.

<p>Under today's market economy, how much would business spending have to grow 
to employ the 8.8 million Americans who were officially unemployed in April? 
  And for those living in U.S. jails and prisons who aren't counted in the 
official jobless rate to be gainfully employed?  One need not have the 
answers to ask the questions.
