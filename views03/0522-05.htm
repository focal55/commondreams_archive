<p>When the Bush administration totals up the cost of the war in Iraq it better be prepared to tack on billions of dollars more to clean up the toxic residue left over from this conflict, specifically its widespread use of cluster weapons and Depleted Uranium (DU).

<p>While the shooting may be winding down, the consequences of the United States using these controversial weapons will be around for a long time to come, with clusters taking a steady toll on the unwary and DU poisoning the air and water.

<p>Cluster munitions bombs, shells and rockets that release highly explosive canisters that shred everything from people to tanks have been an environmental nightmare since the war in Southeast Asia. Some 90 million cluster munitions were dropped on tiny Laos from 1964 to 1973, of which 30 percent failed to explode.

<p>The result is a national minefield that has killed and maimed more than 12,000 people, and which continues to exact a yearly toll of 100 to 200.

<p>The United States used more than 50 million clusters in the 1991 Gulf War. In the two years following the conflict, unexploded bomblets killed 1,400 Kuwaiti civilians. This deadly legacy continues, while there are no figures on the number of cluster weapons or DU ammunition used, they were deployed in the first Gulf War, Kosovo and Afghanistan and it is assumed they were used in Gulf War II. For example, the British humanitarian Mines Advisory Group reported in late April that unexploded munitions caused 52 deaths and 63 injuries in one week after the "liberation" of the Iraqi city of Kirkuk.

<p>Almost as deadly, Depleted Uranium is ubiquitous on any recent American battlefield. The United States used 320 tons of it during the first Gulf War, and 10 tons of it in Kosovo. Its resistance to enemy projectiles and its ability to turn hardened armor into margarine gives the United States an enormous advantage over any opponent who lacks it. 

<p>Anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent of DU turns into tiny dust particles, which may travel as far as 40 kilometers. DU is not very radioactive -- about the same as naturally occurring uranium -- but if ingested, according to the U.S. Environmental Policy Institute, it "has the potential to generate significant medical consequences."

<p>DU has long been a suspect in Gulf War Syndrome, the mélange of physical woes afflicting up to 30 percent of the veterans from the 1991 conflict. The Department of Defense doesn't consider low-level radiation a threat, but a recent study by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute may force a re-evaluation. 

<p>"People have always assumed low doses are not much of a problem," Alexandra Miller of the Institute told The Guardian (a British newspaper), "but they can cause more damage than people think." The study indicates that DU damages bone marrow chromosomes.

<p>Another worry are DU "misses," where the enormous weight and speed of DUs drive them as deep as 24 inches into the ground. "A major concern of the potential environmental effects by intact (DU) penetrators or large penetrator fragments," notes the World Health Organization, "is the potential contamination of ground water after weathering."

<p>Besides being radioactive, DU also is a toxic metal that can damage kidneys and livers. That's a poor legacy to leave behind in a country we are trying to win the hearts and minds of.

<p>Cluster bomb and DU cleanup is likely to be enormously expensive, and who pays for it is an open question. The Bush administration is depending on Iraqi oil sales to foot most of the bill, but the figures don't add up. 

<p>At most, Iraqi oil could bring in $18 billion a year, barely enough to feed the 60 percent of the population dependent on food handouts.

<p>Nor does this even address rebuilding the country's infrastructure, ravaged by 12 years of sanctions and the recent war. The price tag, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm, will probably run in excess of $300 billion.

<p>Iraq also has a debt burden that may be as high as $383 billion, and no one seems to be stepping forward to write it off. Unlike in Gulf War I, where the allies picked up most the tab, the Bush administration's "Coalition of the Willing" is flat broke, and the White House has only allotted $2.4 billion to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. On top of that, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been hesitant to step in without United Nations authority. 

<p>In the end it likely will be Iraqi civilians and U.S. occupation troops who pay the price for the way we choose to use radioactive weapons and cluster bombs when we wage war.
