<p>If there were a 10-metre statue of CNN's Paula Zahn, I'd be the first to throw a rope around its neck and topple it.<P></P>Not to pick on her in particular, okay?<P></P> 
I'd be happy to take down any number of cable news anchors right now, not to mention U.S. President George W. Bush, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Pentagon spokesperson Victoria Clarke, CentCom front man Brig.-Gen. Vincent Brooks, Saddam Hussein, his body doubles and his computer-generated doppelgangers, that master of obfuscation, Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, as well as all the other featured players in Operation Iraqi Freedom with whom I have been embedded these past three weeks.
<P></P>Call it Operation Antonia Freedom. <P></P>I sense that, like the Iraqi people, I'll soon be out on the streets again, singing and dancing, free from the brutal, vicious dictatorship of 24/7 media-watching.<P></P>But seriously...<P></P>Not being a military expert like Vice-President Dick Cheney, I am in no position to make military judgments, as he did yesterday in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, on the analytic capabilities of those "retired military officers embedded in TV studios" who criticized the Pentagon's plan for taking Iraq.<P></P>Never mind that, unlike many of those generals, not to mention hundreds of thousands of other Americans of his generation who served in Vietnam, the multi-millionaire former oil executive "had other priorities" during the war. <P></P>Meanwhile, there was Rumsfeld yesterday, lecturing Western reporters on how this great day for the Iraqi people was their "opportunity to listen and report. It is an historic opportunity for journalists."<P></P>Yeah, well, now that it's relatively safe to do the job without being torn up by U.S. tank fire.<P></P>Anyway, Cheney finally came out to play after not having been seen in public for weeks, not since that March 16 appearance on NBC's <i>Meet The Press </i>when he accurately predicted that the Iraqi people would "welcome as liberators the United States."<P></P>And so they did.<P></P>Yesterday, North America woke up to images of chanting Iraqis in Baghdad's Firdos Square, where a Leninesque statue of Saddam Hussein towered over them. <P></P>They were trying everything to bring it down, ropes around its neck, chains around its feet, hammers on its base. <P></P>Eventually the U.S. Marines moved in, with their tanks, gun-ho attitude and can-do determination, bringing it down with a winch and steel cable.<P></P>As CNN's senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre would later report, even the Iraqis couldn't do "without the muscle of the U.S. military."<P></P>Even if you didn't catch it live, CNN ensured you couldn't miss it because they ran it and re-ran it all day long. (In fact, every time I pause to think as I type this, I turn to the TV and there it goes ... again! ... and again! ... and again!)<P></P>Um, what about that new Osama bin Laden tape? Where exactly is Saddam? Bombs were still falling elsewhere. People were still being maimed and killed.<P></P> And what about winning the peace?<P></P>There didn't seem to be much time for any of that between shots of Saddam's iron head being dragged around town.<P></P>But that wasn't the worst of it.<P></P>No, CNN also featured shots of Edward Chin, the U.S. Marine who climbed the statue before it fell and draped an American flag over its head. <P></P>According to the network's Barbara Starr, there was "an audible gasp" at the Pentagon when that happened &#8212; and you can bet somebody in Virginia was on the blower pronto with Baghdad because that flag came down pretty fast.<P></P>Too late. The scene was telecast to the world, and captured on Internet news sites &#8212; and you can bet it didn't play that well in the Arab bazaars.<P></P>
Still, CNN reveled in the image, even interviewing Connie Chin, Edward's sister, who gushed with pride.
<P></P>Go troops, go.<P></P>Don't get me wrong: I support those kids who are in Iraq, far from home, and who may not be coming back for a long time. And when they do, they may not find jobs, no thanks to this war. They'll also discover the current regime in Washington, which has been cutting taxes for the rich, has also been cutting support to veterans.<P></P> But you don't see that in all this weepy "America's Bravest" coverage.<P></P>And some readers wonder why I get so riled up at U.S. TV news?<P></P>Let me tell you: I can hardly wait for the day when I shall be liberated from the fog of its war coverage.
