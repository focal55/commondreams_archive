<p>Over the last six weeks, major civic groups with deep concerns about 
the impending war with Iraq have requested meetings with President Bush, 
who not once in the past year has met with a domestic antiwar delegation.
<p>    Astonishingly, not one of these groups, which collectively represent
millions of Americans, have received any invitations to meet in response
to their written requests.
<p>    After the completion of his long overdue news conference on March 
7th, Senator Robert Byrd remarked: "He spoke like a man who has stopped
listening." There are many engaged citizens who wonder whether President
Bush ever started listening or at least directly hearing views of civic
leaders who don't want a war, invasion or lengthy occupation of Iraq.
<p>    Many commentators and reporters -- having spoken with people inside 
the Bush Administration -- have noted the isolation, the solitude and the
exclusionary nature of the Bush White House on this subject. Others such
as Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who interviewed President
Bush, say the President views himself as a "black and white" type of
person, of a man who makes decisions "from the gut" or from instinct.
<p>Combined with isolation from many informed contrary views, this attitude
is made more disquieting by the President's continual invoking of God
and God's will, when it comes to Iraq. Viewed from abroad, this
Messianic militarism appears to millions of people as if President Bush
is embarking on a religious war.
<p>    Now is the time for President Bush to spend a few hours listening to
cogent presentations by these Americans of widely different backgrounds
and insights, but mostly similar in their opposition 
towar-invasion-occupation.
<p>   Meeting with representatives of these groups, which oppose the
President's proposed policies would afford President Bush an opportunity
for a two-way exchange. There have been too many monologues, which serve
their purpose of course, but a dialogue tends to probe and clarify the
issues and test the strength of opposing views.
<p>    Leaders of veterans groups and former military leaders are anxious to
convey to the President details of the horrific toxic aftermath of the
war-invasion to both Iraqis and U.S. troops. They know about the first
Gulf War first hand and have been closely associated with the treatment
of over 200,000 soldiers who were disabled and have been receiving
disability payments. Even were the President to take this country to war
he would benefit from knowing how under-trained and inadequately
equipped U.S. soldiers are to defend themselves against what the
President has said is the likely prospect of chemical warfare by Iraq's
brutal dictator.
<p>    *From women's groups, including those back from numerous trips to
Afghanistan, he would learn about the terrible effect on the civilian
population long after hostilities ended, due in part to the lack of 
promised follow-through assistance by the United States to the Kabul 
government. They can also convey the likely consequences on Iraqi 
families whose elderly, mothers and children will especially suffer from 
lack of food, spreading disease, fires, and score-settling.
<p>    *From the perspective of working families, the President would hear 
why this is the first time that major labor unions, with the encouragement
of the AFL-CIO, have ever opposed a war by the United States, in part
because it is an unprovoked war.
<p>    *From the business leaders, he would hear concerns about the further
instability and decline of our economy with its effects on standards of
living, employment and neglected domestic budgets.
<p>    *From representatives of the clergy, the President would hear why the
broad religious community believes there is no  moral justification for 
this war and its chaotic.
<p>    *From leading physicians having experience poor with health conditions
and capacity in Iraq, the President will be informed of the scale of 
civilian mortality and morbidity, including contagious diseases, that 
come from war and its aftermath.
<p>    The additional organizations requesting to meet with the President
represent a broad cross-section of the American people.  They include:
elected representatives of city councils representing tens of millions
of Americans; environmental organizations knowledgeable about the
environmental devastation to the region and the planet on a level even
greater than 1991 that is likely from this proposed war; international
intelligence specialists with past governmental experience who will tell
the President what many dissenters inside the Pentagon and the State
Department cannot say about consequences and alternatives, prominent
academics, historians and civic leaders; and the next generation, from
groups representing millions of college students.
<p>    They seek a dialogue with President Bush, not out of political
partisanship, but because they have not been convinced that war with
Iraq is necessary.
