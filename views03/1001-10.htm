<p> For several weeks now I've posted on my office door a daily list, 
 Killed in Iraq Today: The names, pictures, and ages of all U.S. 
 casualties in Iraq. By last week they covered the entire door and
surrounding frame.
<p> I'm not certain why I began doing this. Like many others, I'm torn
up each day as I read about this unconscionable loss of life. In part, 
I suspect that I somehow feel responsible, even complicit in their 
deaths because they were sent off to kill and be killed in my name. 
And I never feel I'm doing enough to get the troops back home.
<p>I also wanted a graphic display so that the human consequences of 
all the official lying couldn't be evaded by anyone passing by my office.
<p>Adjacent to the pictures, a notepad is attached to the wall with an 
invitation to leave comments. Dozens have done so but there is little 
agreement. Examples: 
<p>1) "It's  incredibly sad that so many people lost 
their lives for absolutely nothing."

<p>2) "It's not for us to reason why but to do or die. Grow up!" 
<p>3)"Freedom is paid for by the blood of patriots." 
<p>4)I have a friend in 
 bootcamp and pray every day that I won't see his face on your door." 
<p>5)"This is what blood for oil looks like."
<p>Whatever their feelings, these folks went beyond the statistics to 
ponder the faces of fellow citizens who've made the ultimate 
 sacrifice. For a heart-rending and haunting reality check,readers may 
wish to go to: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2003/iraq/forces/casualties/" target="_new">cnn.com/SPECIAL/2003/iraq/forces/casualties/
</a>
<p>For myself, I've been heartened to read about the parents of U.S. 
soldiers in Iraq, including those in the Reserves, who've begun 
 organizing against the occupation. Fernando Suarez, whose 20 year old 
 son, Jesus, was killed in Iraq, recently accused President Bush of 
 being responsible for his son's death when he wrote, "My son died 
because Bush lied." Mr. Suarez has joined 1,300 other parents of 
 soldiers in Iraq to say,"It is time for these troops to come home. 
Neither my wife nor my family want more children to die in this 
illegal war. We are no less patriotic for wanting peace."
<p>Larry Syverson, father of two sons serving in Tikrit and Baghdad, 
wrote, "I'm in awe of my sons and the honorable service they give. But 
the leaders they serve have not acted honorably. They have failed my 
sons. They have failed all of us." (<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0927-08.htm" target="_new">The Guardian, 9/27/03</a>)
<p>Tom Predmore, a soldier in the 101st Airborne Division, based in 
Mosul, recently wrote <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0917-13.htm" target="_new">a lengthy piece</a> in the Peoria Journal Star, in 
which he declared,"For the past six months, I have been participating 
in what I believe to be the great modern lie: Operation Iraqi 
Freedom."
<p> Even today, the real reasons for the war are avoided by the dominant 
media and administration officials are never asked the obvious 
questions. But Predmore dares to mention the pink elephant standing in 
the living room when he inquires, "So what is our purpose here?" His 
answer: "This looks like a modern-day crusade not to free an oppressed 
 people or rid the world of a demonic dictator...but a crusade to 
control another nation's national resource. Oil - at least to me - 
seems to be the reason for our presence."  But beyond these unsavory 
motives, massive deceit, the puppet Chalabi's clique and crony 
capitalism reconstruction contracts, one compelling truth
 remains: our men and women are dying. There are 12-15 attacks on U.S. 
forces every day, resulting in substantial numbers of wounded soldiers.
<p>What to do? Many groups like Veterans for Peace and the rapidly 
growing Military Families group are demanding the withdrawal of all 
 occupation forces. The United Electrical Worker's union recently 
 passed a resolution that calls on the Bush administration to 
 immediately cease military operations in Iraq; bring home U.S. 
 military personnel and turn over the task of rebuilding Iraq to a 
 genuine multinational peace-keeping force under the supervision of the 
 United Nations, with the United States making good on its obligation 
to finance rebuilding; And all efforts to give Iraq's industries, 
 service sector, and public resources to multinational corporations 
should cease.
<p> Some U.S. officials believe that a given number of casualties is 
 "acceptable." I would argue that not a single causality is acceptable. 
 As soldier Tom Predmore pleads from Iraq, "How many more must die? How 
 many more tears must be shed before Americans awake and demand the 
return of the men and women whose job it is to protect them, rather 
 than their leader's interest?"
<p> Meanwhile we await tomorrow's list from the Department of Defense.
