<p><i>Profoundly anti-Israel views are increasingly finding support in progressive 
intellectual communities. Serious and thoughtful people are advocating and 
taking actions that are anti-semitic in their effect if not their intent.<br>
--
</i>Lawrence Summers, 17 September 2002 

<p>When the president of Harvard University declared that to criticize Israel 
at this time and to call on universities to divest from Israel are 'actions 
that are anti-semitic in their effect, if not their intent', he introduced a 
distinction between effective and intentional anti-semitism that is 
controversial at best. The counter-charge has been that in making his 
statement, Summers has struck a blow against academic freedom, in effect, if 
not in intent. Although he insisted that he meant nothing censorious by his 
remarks, and that he is in favor of Israeli policy being 'debated freely 
and civilly', his words have had a chilling effect on political discourse. 
Among those actions which he called 'effectively anti-semitic' were European 
boycotts of Israel, anti-globalization rallies at which criticisms of Israel 

were voiced, and fund-raising efforts for organizations of 'questionable 
political provenance'. Of local concern to him, however, was a divestment 
petition drafted by MIT and Harvard faculty members who oppose Israel's 
current occupation and its treatment of Palestinians. Summers asked why 
Israel was being 'singled out . . . among all nations' for a divestment 
campaign, suggesting that the singling out was evidence of anti-semitic 
intentions. And though he claimed that aspects of Israel's 'foreign and 
defense' policy 'can be and should be vigorously challenged', it was unclear 
how such challenges could or would take place without being construed as 
anti-Israel, and why these policy issues, which include occupation, ought 
not to be vigorously challenged through a divestment campaign. It would seem 
that calling for divestment is something other than a legitimately 'vigorous 
challenge', but we are not given any criteria by which to adjudicate between 
vigorous challenges that should be articulated, and those which carry the 
'effective' force of anti-semitism.

<p>Summers is right to voice concern about rising anti-semitism, and every 
progressive person ought to challenge anti-semitism vigorously wherever it 
occurs. It seems, though, that historically we have now reached a position 
in which Jews cannot legitimately be understood always and only as 
presumptive victims. Sometimes we surely are, but sometimes we surely are 
not. No political ethics can start from the assumption that Jews monopolize 
the position of victim. 'Victim' is a quickly transposable term: it can 
shift from minute to minute, from the Jew killed by suicide bombers on a bus 
to the Palestinian child killed by Israeli gunfire. The public sphere needs 
to be one in which both kinds of violence are challenged insistently and in 
the name of justice.

<p>If we think that to criticize Israeli violence, or to call for economic pressure 
to be put on the Israeli state to change its policies, is to be 'effectively 
anti-semitic', we will fail to voice our opposition for fear of being named 
as part of an anti-semitic enterprise. No label could be worse for a Jew, 
who knows that, ethically and politically, the position with which it would 
be unbearable to identify is that of the anti-semite. The ethical framework 
within which most progressive Jews operate takes the form of the following 
question: will we be silent (and thereby collaborate with illegitimately 
violent power), or will we make our voices heard (and be counted among those 
who did what they could to stop that violence), even if speaking poses a 
risk? The current Jewish critique of Israel is often portrayed as 
insensitive to Jewish suffering, past as well as present, yet its ethic is 
based on the experience of suffering, in order that suffering might stop.

<p>Summers uses the 'anti-semitic' charge to quell public criticism of Israel, 
even as he explicitly distances himself from the overt operations of 
censorship. He writes, for instance, that 'the only antidote to dangerous 
ideas is strong alternatives vigorously advocated.' But how does one 
vigorously advocate the idea that the Israeli occupation is brutal and 
wrong, and Palestinian self-determination a necessary good, if the voicing 
of those views calls down the charge of anti-semitism?

<p>To understand Summers's claim, we have to be able to conceive of an 
effective anti-semitism, one that pertains to certain speech acts. Either it 
follows on certain utterances, or it structures them, even if that is not 
the conscious intention of those making them. His view assumes that such 
utterances will be taken by others as anti-semitic, or received within a 
given context as anti-semitic. So we have to ask what context Summers has 
in mind when he makes his claim; in what context is it the case that any 
criticism of Israel will be taken to be anti-semitic?

<p>It may be that what Summers was effectively saying is that the only way a 
criticism of Israel can be heard is through a certain acoustic frame, such 
that the criticism, whether it is of the West Bank settlements, the closing 
of Birzeit and Bethlehem University, the demolition of homes in Ramallah 
or Jenin, or the killing of numerous children and civilians, can only be 
interpreted as showing hatred for Jews. We are asked to conjure a listener 
who attributes an intention to the speaker: so-and-so has made a public 
statement against the Israeli occupation, and this must mean that so-and-so 
hates Jews or is willing to fuel those who do. The criticism is thus given a 
hidden meaning, one that is at odds with its explicit claim. The criticism 
of Israel is nothing more than a cloak for that hatred, or a cover for a 
call for discriminatory action against Jews. In other words, the only way to 
understand effective anti-semitism is to presuppose intentional 
anti-semitism; the effective anti-semitism of any criticism turns out to 
reside in the intention of the speaker as retrospectively attributed by the 
listener.

<p>It may be that Summers has something else in mind; namely, that the 
criticism will be exploited by those who want to see not only the 
destruction of Israel but the degradation or devaluation of Jewish people 
in general. There is always that risk, but to claim that such criticism of 
Israel can be taken only as criticism of Jews is to attribute to that 
particular interpretation the power to monopolize the field of reception. 

The argument against letting criticism of Israel into the public sphere 
would be that it gives fodder to those with anti-semitic intentions, who 
will successfully co-opt the criticism. Here again, a statement can become 
effectively anti-semitic only if there is, somewhere, an intention to use it 
for anti-semitic purposes. Indeed, even if one believed that criticisms of 
Israel are by and large heard as anti-semitic (by Jews, anti-semites, or 
people who could be described as neither), it would become the 
responsibility of all of us to change the conditions of reception so that 
the public might begin to distinguish between criticism of Israel and a 
hatred of Jews.

<p>Summers made his statement as president of an institution which is a 
symbol of academic prestige in the United States, and although he claimed 
he was speaking not as president of the university but as a 'member of our 
community', his speech carried weight in the press precisely because he was 
exercising the authority of his office. If the president of Harvard is letting 
the public know that he will take any criticism of Israel to be effectively 
anti-semitic, then he is saying that public discourse itself ought to be so 
constrained that such statements are not uttered, and that those who utter 
them will be understood as engaging in anti-semitic speech, even hate 
speech.

<p>Here, it is important to distinguish between anti-semitic speech which, say, 
produces a hostile and threatening environment for Jewish students - racist 
speech which any university administrator would be obliged to oppose and 
regulate - and speech which makes a student uncomfortable because it opposes 
a particular state or set of state policies that he or she may defend. The latter 
is a political debate, and if we say that the case of Israel is different, that any 
criticism of it is considered as an attack on Israelis, or Jews in general, 
then we have singled out this political allegiance from all other allegiances 
that are open to public debate. We have engaged in the most outrageous 
form of 'effective' censorship.

<p>The point is not only that Summers's distinction between effective and 
intentional anti-semitism cannot hold, but that the way it collapses in his 
formulation is precisely what produces the conditions under which certain 
public views are taken to be hate speech, in effect if not in intent. Summers 
didn't say that anything that Israel does in the name of self-defense is 
legitimate and ought not to be questioned. I don't know whether he 
approves of all Israeli policies, but let's imagine, for the sake of argument, 
that he doesn't. And I don't know whether he has views about, for instance, 
the destruction of homes and the killings of children in Jenin which 
attracted the attention of the United Nations last year but was not 
investigated as a human rights violation because Israel refused to open its 
borders to an investigative team. If he objects to those actions, and they are 
among the 'foreign policy' issues he believes ought to be 'vigorously 
challenged', he would be compelled, under his formulation, not to voice 
his disapproval, believing, as he does, that that would be construed, 
effectively, as anti-semitism. And if he thinks it possible to voice 
disapproval, he hasn't shown us how to do it in such a way as to avert the 
allegation of anti-semitism.

<p>Summers's logic suggests that certain actions of the Israeli state must be 
allowed to go on unimpeded by public protest, for fear that any protest 
would be tantamount to anti-semitism, if not anti-semitism itself. Now, all 
forms of anti-semitism must be opposed, but we have here a set of serious 
confusions about the forms anti-semitism takes. Indeed, if the charge of 
anti-semitism is used to defend Israel at all costs, then its power when 
used against those who do discriminate against Jews - who do violence to 
synagogues in Europe, wave Nazi flags or support anti-semitic organizations 
- is radically diluted. Many critics of Israel now dismiss all claims of 
anti-semitism as 'trumped up', having been exposed to their use as a way of 
censoring political speech.

<p>Summers doesn't tell us why divestment campaigns or other forms of public 
protest are anti-semitic. According to him, some forms of anti-semitism are 
characterized as such retroactively, which means that nothing should be said 
or done that will then be taken to be anti-semitic by others. But what if 
those others are wrong? If we take one form of anti-semitism to be defined 
retroactively, what is left of the possibility of legitimate protest against 
a state, either by its own population or anyone else? If we say that every 
time the word 'Israel' is spoken, the speaker really means 'Jews', then we 
have foreclosed in advance the possibility that the speaker really means 
'Israel'. If, on the other hand, we distinguish between anti-semitism and 
forms of protest against the Israeli state (or right-wing settlers who 
sometimes act independently of the state), acknowledging that sometimes 
they do, disturbingly, work together, then we stand a chance of understanding 
that world Jewry does not see itself as one with Israel in its present form 
and practice, and that Jews in Israel do not necessarily see themselves as 
one with the state. In other words, the possibility of a substantive Jewish 
peace movement depends on our observing a productive and critical distance 
from the state of Israel (which can be coupled with a profound investment in 
its future course).

<p>Summers's view seems to imply that criticism of Israel is 'anti-Israel' in 
the sense that it is understood to challenge the right of Israel to exist. A 
criticism of Israel is not the same, however, as a challenge to Israel's 
existence, even if there are conditions under which it would be possible to 
say that one leads to the other. A challenge to the right of Israel to exist 
can be construed as a challenge to the existence of the Jewish people only 
if one believes that Israel alone keeps the Jewish people alive or that all 
Jews invest their sense of perpetuity in the state of Israel in its current 
or traditional forms. One could argue, however, that those polities which 
safeguard the right to criticize them stand a better chance of surviving 
than those that don't. For a criticism of Israel to be taken as a challenge 
to the survival of the Jews, we would have to assume not only that 'Israel' 
cannot change in response to legitimate criticism, but that a more radically 
democratic Israel would be bad for Jews. This would be to suppose that 
criticism is not a Jewish value, which clearly flies in the face not only of 
long traditions of Talmudic disputation, but of all the religious and 
cultural sources that have been part of Jewish life for centuries.

<p>What are we to make of Jews who disidentify with Israel or, at least, with 
the Israeli state? Or Jews who identify with Israel, but do not condone some 
of its practices? There is a wide range here: those who are silently 
ambivalent about the way Israel handles itself; those who only half 
articulate their doubts about the occupation; those who are strongly opposed 
to the occupation, but within a Zionist framework; those who would like to 
see Zionism rethought or, indeed, abandoned. Jews may hold any of these 
opinions, but voice them only to their family, or only to their friends; or 
voice them in public but then face an angry reception at home. Given this 
Jewish ambivalence, ought we not to be suspicious of any effort to equate 
Jews with Israel? The argument that all Jews have a heartfelt investment in 
the state of Israel is untrue. Some have a heartfelt investment in corned 
beef sandwiches or in certain Talmudic tales, religious rituals and liturgy, 
in memories of their grandmother, the taste of borscht or the sounds of the 
old Yiddish theatre. Others have an investment in historical and cultural 
archives from Eastern Europe or from the Holocaust, or in forms of labor 
activism, civil rights struggles and social justice that are thoroughly 
secular, and exist in relative independence from the question of Israel.

<p>What do we make of Jews such as myself, who are emotionally invested 
in the state of Israel, critical of its current form, and call for a radical 
restructuring of its economic and juridical basis precisely because we are 
invested in it? It is always possible to say that such Jews have turned 
against their own Jewishness. But what if one criticizes Israel in the name 
of one's Jewishness, in the name of justice, precisely because such 
criticisms seem 'best for the Jews'? Why wouldn't it always be 'best for the 
Jews' to embrace forms of democracy that extend what is 'best' to everyone, 
Jewish or not? I signed a petition framed in these terms, an 'Open Letter 
from American Jews', in which 3700 American Jews opposed the Israeli 
occupation, though in my view it was not nearly strong enough: it did not 
call for the end of Zionism, or for the reallocation of arable land, for 
rethinking the Jewish right of return or for the fair distribution of water 
and medicine to Palestinians, and it did not call for the reorganization of 
the Israeli state on a more radically egalitarian basis. It was, nevertheless, 
an overt criticism of Israel.

<p>Many of those who signed that petition will have felt what might reasonably 
be called heartache at taking a public stand against Israeli policy, at the 
thought that Israel, by subjecting 3.5 million Palestinians to military 
occupation, represents the Jews in a way that these petitioners find not 

only objectionable, but terrible to endure, as Jews; it is as Jews that they 
assert their disidentification with that policy, that they seek to widen the 
rift between the state of Israel and the Jewish people in order to produce 
an alternative vision of the future. The petitioners exercised a democratic 
right to voice criticism, and sought to get economic pressure put on Israel 
by the US and other countries, to implement rights for Palestinians 
otherwise deprived of basic conditions of self-determination, to end the 
occupation, to secure an independent Palestinian state or to re-establish 
the basis of the Israeli state without regard to religion so that Jewishness 
would constitute only one cultural and religious reality, and be protected 
by the same laws that protect the rights of others.

<p>Identifying Israel with Jewry obscures the existence of the small but 
important post-Zionist movement in Israel, including the philosophers Adi 
Ophir and Anat Biletzki, the sociologist Uri Ram, the professor of theatre 
Avraham Oz and the poet Yitzhak Laor. Are we to say that Israelis who are 
critical of Israeli policy are self-hating Jews, or insensitive to the ways 
in which criticism may fan the flames of anti-semitism? What of the new Brit 
Tzedek organization in the US, numbering close to 20,000 members at the last 
count, which seeks to offer a critical alternative to the American Israel 
Political Action Committee, opposing the current occupation and working for 
a two-state solution? What of Jewish Voices for Peace, Jews against the 
Occupation, Jews for Peace in the Middle East, the Faculty for 
Israeli-Palestinian Peace, Tikkun, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, 
Women in Black or, indeed, Neve Shalom-Wahat al-Salam, the only village 
collectively governed by both Jews and Arabs in the state of Israel? What do 
we make of B'Tselem, the Israeli organization that monitors human rights 
abuses in the West Bank and Gaza, or Gush Shalom, an Israeli organization 
opposing the occupation, or Yesh Gvul, which represents the Israeli soldiers 
who refuse to serve in the Occupied Territories? And what of Ta'ayush, a 
Jewish-Arab coalition against policies that lead to isolation, poor medical 
care, house arrest, the destruction of educational institutions, and lack of 
water and food for Palestinians?

<p>It will not do to equate Jews with Zionists or Jewishness with Zionism. 
There were debates among Jews throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries 
as to whether Zionism ought to become the basis of a state, whether the Jews 
had any right to lay claim to land inhabited by Palestinians for centuries, 
and as to the future for a Jewish political project based on a violent 
expropriation of land. There were those who sought to make Zionism 
compatible with peaceful co-existence with Arabs, and those who used it as 
an excuse for military aggression, and continue to do so. There were those 
who thought, and still think, that Zionism is not a legitimate basis for a 
democratic state in a situation where a diverse population must be assumed 
to practice different religions, and that no group ought to be excluded from 
any right accorded to citizens in general on the basis of their ethnic or 
religious views. And there are those who maintain that the violent 
appropriation of Palestinian land, and the dislocation of 700,000 
Palestinians, was an unsuitable foundation on which to build a state. Yet 
Israel is now repeating its founding gesture in the containment and 
dehumanization of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. Indeed, the wall 
now being built threatens to leave 95,000 Palestinians homeless. These are 
questions about Zionism that should and must be asked in a public domain, 
and universities are surely one place where we might expect critical 
reflections on Zionism to take place. Instead, we are being asked, by 
Summers and others, to treat any critical approach to Zionism as effective 
anti-semitism and, hence, to rule it out as a topic for legitimate disagreement.

<p>Many important distinctions are elided by the mainstream press when it 
assumes that there are only two possible positions on the Middle East, the 
'pro-Israel' and the 'pro-Palestinian'. The assumption is that these are 
discrete views, internally homogeneous, non-overlapping, that if one is 
'pro-Israel' then anything Israel does is all right, or if 'pro-Palestinian' 
then anything Palestinians do is all right. But few people's political views 
occupy such extremes. One can, for instance, be in favor of Palestinian 
self-determination, but condemn suicide bombings, and find others who share 
both those views but differ on the form self-determination ought to take. 
One can be in favor of Israel's right to exist, but still ask what is the 
most legitimate and democratic form that existence ought to take. If one 
questions the present form, is one anti-Israel? If one holds out for a truly 
democratic Israel-Palestine, is one anti-Israel? Or is one trying to find a 
better form for this polity, one that may well involve any number of 
possibilities: a revised version of Zionism, a post-Zionist Israel, a 
self-determining Palestine, or an amalgamation of Israel into a greater 
Israel-Palestine where all racially and religiously based qualifications on 
rights and entitlements would be eliminated?

<p>What is ironic is that in equating Zionism with Jewishness, Summers is 
adopting the very tactic favored by anti-semites. At the time of his 
speech, I found myself on a listserv on which a number of individuals 
opposed to the current policies of the state of Israel, and sometimes to 
Zionism, started to engage in this same slippage, sometimes opposing what 
they called 'Zionism' and at other times what they called 'Jewish' 
interests. Whenever this occurred, there were objections, and several people 
withdrew from the group. Mona Baker, the academic in Manchester who 
dismissed two Israeli colleagues from the board of her academic journal in 
an effort to boycott Israeli institutions, argued that there was no way to 
distinguish between individuals and institutions. In dismissing these 
individuals, she claimed, she was treating them as emblematic of the Israeli 
state, since they were citizens of that country. But citizens are not the 
same as states: the very possibility of significant dissent depends on 
recognizing the difference between them. Baker's response to subsequent 
criticism was to submit e-mails to the 'academicsforjustice' listserv 
complaining about 'Jewish' newspapers and labeling as 'pressure' the 
opportunity that some of these newspapers offered to discuss the issue in 
print with the colleagues she had dismissed. She refused to do this and 
seemed now to be fighting against 'Jews', identified as a lobby that 
pressures people, a lobby that had put pressure on her. The criticism that I 
made of Summers's view thus applies to Baker as well: it is one thing to 
oppose Israel in its current form and practices or, indeed, to have critical 
questions about Zionism itself, but it is quite another to oppose 'Jews' or 
assume that all 'Jews' have the same view, that they are all in favor of 
Israel, identified with Israel or represented by Israel. Oddly, and painfully, 
it has to be said that on this point Mona Baker and Lawrence Summers 
agree: Jews are the same as Israel. In the one instance, the premise works 
in the service of an argument against anti-semitism; in the second, it 
works as the effect of anti-semitism itself. One aspect of anti-semitism or, 
indeed, of any form of racism is that an entire people is falsely and 
summarily equated with a particular position, view or disposition. To say 
that all Jews hold a given view on Israel or are adequately represented by 
Israel or, conversely, that the acts of Israel, the state, adequately stand 
for the acts of all Jews, is to conflate Jews with Israel and, thereby, to 
commit an anti-semitic reduction of Jewishness. 

<p>In holding out for a distinction to be made between Israel and Jews, I am 
calling for a space for dissent for Jews, and non-Jews, who have criticisms 
of Israel to articulate; but I am also opposing anti-semitic reductions of 
Jewishness to Israeli interests. The 'Jew' is no more defined by Israel than 
by anti-semitism. The 'Jew' exceeds both determinations, and is to be found, 
substantively, as a historically and culturally changing identity that takes 
no single form and has no single telos. Once the distinction is made, 
discussion of both Zionism and anti-semitism can begin, since it will be as 
important to understand the legacy of Zionism and to debate its future as to 
oppose anti-semitism wherever we find it.

<p>What is needed is a public space in which such issues might be thoughtfully 
debated, and to prevent that space being defined by certain kinds of 
exclusion and censorship. If one can't voice an objection to violence done 
by Israel without attracting a charge of anti-semitism, then that charge 
works to circumscribe the publicly acceptable domain of speech, and to 
immunize Israeli violence against criticism. One is threatened with the 
label 'anti-semitic' in the same way that one is threatened with being 
called a 'traitor' if one opposes the most recent US war. Such threats aim 
to define the limits of the public sphere by setting limits on the 
speakable. The world of public discourse would then be one from which 
critical perspectives would be excluded, and the public would come to 
understand itself as one that does not speak out in the face of obvious and 

illegitimate violence.
