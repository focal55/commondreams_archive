<p> The chatterers are still digging themselves out. They'd already bought 
into this war. They'd stopped asking why -- or why now -- weeks ago. 
They were counting countries and comparing bookings. Where's France? 
Who's got Rumsfeld or Ridge? But last weekend suggests that George W. Bush 
hasn't sold this war nearly so well outside the storm center as he has 
inside it. The fact that war may be a foregone conclusion is no excuse 
for not asking the hard questions. Back to basics. 
	<p>Who were all the people out protesting? Just people, an 81-year-old 
friend told me, who hadn't been to a march in years and was nursing her 
legs. My daughter wanted to go with a delegation from her school, but 
she was home with a fever. Everyone complained that there were hardly any 
cameras there, a friend told me. But word got out even if the 
Democratic candidates who might be the natural leaders and attention-getters 
are, with the exception of Howard Dean, still fighting the last war. 
	<p>What had been striking about the polls on this war is how, in every 
debate, everybody always had one that supported his position, rendering 
all of them virtually meaningless. The administration kept claiming 
everyone was behind them. People do like Bush, and as my father used to 
say, you can't beat a horse with no horse. In that atmosphere, the 
administration succeeded in convincing at least those who come in closest 
contact with it to translate its own determination to use force and thus 
the inevitability of war into the appearance of public acceptance of it; 
to extend the pre-emption policy of foreign affairs into media coverage 
of policy. The media and the smart boys (sorry, but they are mostly 
boys) tuned in and out before most people realized it was time for the 
World Series. 
	<p>Why? You hardly hear anyone even ask it anymore; its about who's 
hoodwinking who, and how, and with what, and what the score is in the United 
Nations. 
	<p>Why now? He's been a bad guy for a long time, poisoned his own people 
years ago. 
	<p>What's the role of oil in all this? What will be the reaction in the 
Arab world if the United States is seen as going it alone? The country 
is now engaged in a debate that Democrats were afraid to have and the 
media passed over. 
	<p>Here's how Washington works. You get sold. You have to believe the 
people you work for or report on are ultimately smart. If 
you're covering them, your success depends to a certain, large extent on 
their cooperation, on their coming on your show, giving you access. If you 
work with them, you don't get access, face time or promotions by 
telling them they're wrong; and that applies from bookers to Colin Powell, 
from lowly direct-reports to Donald Rumsfeld. 
	<p>Yes is always the safest answer. “Here's how” beats “you're wrong”. At a 
certain point, no one asks why you're headed in a certain direction, but 
only how many you've added to your column, or who's for and against -- 
and you keep track. 
	<p>But there's a war coming, and clearly millions of Americans are not 
persuaded and don't know the answers.  To watch the press, you'd think 
the questions had long been addressed. 
	<p>The emergence of an antiwar movement has almost been an afterthought 
for a debate that has never really happened. 
	<p>Which makes the next set of questions even more difficult: 
	<p>Are we allowed to keep raising these questions once the war begins? 
What was the lesson of Vietnam? That you aren't supposed to go to war 
without public support, or that you aren't supposed to protest when there 
are servicemen and women who are putting their lives on the line for 
their country? Do Pearl Harbor rules apply, even though we didn't exactly 
have a Declaration of War? Does a blank check from a band of cowardly 
lions count? 
	<p>Washington is digging out. President Bush is reportedly determined to 
push on, despite what the world, the demonstrators or anyone else has 
to say. 
	<p>Is war a foregone conclusion? So what if it is. That shouldn't deter 
the media from acting as if it isn't. Isn't that why we have a First 
Amendment?
