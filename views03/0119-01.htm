<p>MENOMONIE, WISCONSIN -- Jan. 18, 2003 -- 
Earlier today, I attended a rally opposing a new Mideast 
war, held in the small Midwest community of Menomonie 
(population 15,000), set amidst the rolling hills and dairy farms 
of northwestern Wisconsin.  Despite a blustery winter day, 
with a wind chill hovering around zero, about 200 people 
turned out for the rally and march on Main Street, far 
exceeding the expectations of local organizers. 

<p>Marchers held signs on all four corners of the major 
downtown intersection, in front of a cafe and 
theater, as passing cars and pick-up trucks 
honked their greetings. The rally, which was well covered 
by area TV stations, was organized in only one week. 
(Organizers jokingly  estimated the crowd at 6,000, 
so the media would report an accurate lower number.) 

<p>Enormous rallies were held today around 
the world against an invasion of Iraq, including hundreds of 
thousands who turned out in Washington DC and San Francisco. 
While those huge rallies demonstrate the breadth 
of antiwar activism in the country, the rallies 
today in Menomonie and other smaller communities 
show the depth of antiwar sentiment spreading around 
the country. We expect large rallies in San Francisco 
or in the state capital of Madison, but not in Menomonie. 

<p>As a participant in the movement opposing 
the first Gulf War, it appears to me that the sentiment 
is more widespread now than in 1990-91, 
and can be found in pockets where it had 
not previously penetrated. Some Menomonie rally participants 
had wanted to travel to Washington, but were limited 
by funds and family or work obligations. They instead 
decided to remain in their own area, to convey 
their feelings to local residents and media, to begin 
a difficult and rewarding process of social change 
at home. 

<p>Menomonie is a nice little town. Residents still greet 
each other on Main Street. The town still has barber shops 
where retired men sit and talk for hours. It has 
bathroom hot air dispensers with instructions 
that do not have letters scratched out to spell 
nasty words.  In short, it is the quintessential 
polite Midwestern town, where one would least 
expect to find traces of antiwar activism. 

<p>Menomonie is also home to the 
University of Wisconsin-Stout, but the semester 
does not begin until next week.  Everyone at the rally 
agreed that many more would have attended had the 
college students had been on campus. Many 
grandparents, parents, and small children attended 
the rally, lending it an intergenerational legitimacy 
not felt at many campus demonstrations. 

<p>It is through patient community organizing that area peace 
groups attracted 200 people to the protest on Main Street today. 
Much of the emphasis of the peace movement has in past years 
been on activism--mobilizing and activating the people 
who already have progressive political impulses to attend rallies 
or other actions. 

<p><b>Organizing and activism </b>
<p>A growing emphasis on community organizing is 
giving the new peace movement a needed boost. 
Peace groups need both "organizing" to build the movement, 
and "activism" to deepen its impact. A balance of organizing 
and activism can help avoid both social isolation and 
and the political/legal "hoops" we are always made to jump 
through. Activism is a way to set our own agenda, instead 
of simply responding to crises.Organizing is about attracting new people 
into the movement to keep it alive and kicking. 

<p>Organizing does not mean just putting on events or 
benefits that "preach to the choir." It does not mean looking 
inward to our own groups or networking with other groups. Organizing 
is the art of convincing the unconvinced, and building relationships with 
people from different walks of life. It means getting outside our usual 
circles and reaching people who have not been reached before. 

<p>Organizing is about changing minds, and recognizing that most people 
already have a split consciousness that contains both progressive 
and conservative impulses. Organizing means not writing off someone 
because they sound like an angry "redneck," but working with the 
progressive half of their mind--finding out the conditions that make 
them angry, and help direct their anger toward the corporate or government 
structures that really created the conditions. 

<p>Organizing means not overestimating the factual knowledge that people have, 
but also not underestimating their intelligence and wisdom once they have the facts. 
It means not talking over people's heads, or talking down to 
people. It means having faith in the ability of people to understand and change. 

<p>Above all, effective grassroots organizing in this era of corporate 
advertising means making some real link to people's everyday lives. 
No matter what the issue we are addressing, we have to make some 
simple and relevant connection to people's past experiences, 
the places they live today, or alternative ways of doing things in the future. 

<p>We often talk about what appear to be high-level abstractions to most 
people--free trade agreements, foreign policy conspiracies, Washington 
scandals--without showing how they affect human beings in a way they 
can see, hear and feel. We often talk about the negative violations 
of human rights at home and abroad, but forget that many people are 
drawn to political groups also for their positive visions of a better future. 

<p>Some progressive activists attack "mainstream" people as nothing but 
consumers and TV watchers, without recognizing that people are 
passive because they feel powerless, and feel they have limited choices 
in their lives. The Native American poet John Trudell has said that 
"white people feel they are not oppressed, but they feel powerless. 
Indian people know they are oppressed, but don't feel powerless." 
We forget that certain sectors of society possess enormous 
power when it comes to issues of war and peace, even if they do 
not yet realize it. 

<p><b>Key constituencies </b>
<p>At the Menomonie rally today,  I stood with two local high school 
students who were thrilled to see a march stretched 
along two blocks of Main Street, and a Vietnam veteran 
from Eau Claire, whose father had fought in World 
War II and his grandfather in World War I. They 
represented two out of the three constituencies with an influence 
in matters of war and peace that far outweigh 
their numbers: high school students, military personnel, 
and military workers. 

<p>High schools have become a battleground 
for the hearts and minds of American youth. 
Military recruiters have poured enormous 
resources into the high schools to convince students to 
join the armed forces. By the time they leave high school, 
students have decided whether or not to enlist, or 
(in the case of 18-year-old males) whether to register for 
the draft.  Yet the peace movement has focused much 
of its energies on university campuses, where important 
and creative organizing is being done, but too late for many 
military-age youth. 

<p>Military personnel, past and present, also have a 
central role in the new peace movement.  Many 
veterans spoke at the rallies today around the country. 
In the first Gulf War, hundreds of military resisters refused 
to be deployed to the Gulf, and some communities 
offered themselves as "sanctuaries" that would not 
turn in the resisters. We can expect to see similar 
incidents during the current deployment, but just 
as important is the information and insights that 
active-duty and reservist personnel can provide 
the peace movement.  Yet peace 
groups are often reticent about working with GIs, 
partly out of fear of a negative reaction or of getting 
the troops into legal trouble. 

<p>Besides high school students and military personnel, 
a third key group is military workers, who manufacture 
the weapons and often have troubled consciences 
about doing so. They could play an invaluable role in 
steering their unions and businesses toward 
emphasizing civilian-sector contracts. Most military 
workers have little or no awareness of where the 
howitzers or chemical munitions are heading, or 
what foreign militaries are purchasing them for 
use against civilians.  The peace movement could provide 
them that information. 

<p>Much of the focus of traditional peace groups toward 
high school students, military personnel, and 
military workers has usually been to facilitate open resistance, 
such as Conscientious Objection among draft-age youth or 
GIs. COs have played a heroic role in the peace movement 
for many decades, but the young person who openly 
resists for ideological or religious reasons is relatively rare. 
It may be more effective to identify more low-level, discreet 
means that high school students, GIs and military workers can 
use to slow down the war machine. 

<p>Thousands of young men who quietly delay registering 
for  the draft until just before their 26th birthday 
(when federal restrictions on loans and jobs 
become permanent), or fail to report their address 
changes, are doing far more to frustrate the Selective 
Service System than a solitary CO. 

<p>Veterans who speak with high school students 
offer a more realistic view of 
war than that offered by military recruiters. 
Many GIs who quietly talk or organize 
among themselves can be more effective than a single public 
resister. 

<p>As for workers in military plants, anyone who 
has worked in a dead-end job knows that there are ways 
to slow down operations, without going public or 
violating any laws. Peace activists or organizers can 
further our efforts by working respectfully with 
people directly involved in the "military-industrial 
complex," and with people from all different walks 
of life. 

<p><b>Movement culture </b>
<p>The public and media image of the peace movement, dating from 
the 1960s, is of campus intellectuals, countercultural 
activists, and fuzzy-headed "naive" pacifists.  To some extent, 
there is a kernel of truth in this image. Since the 1960s, 
the movement has been largely centered in an white, urban 
upper middle-class culture, with some important 
historical exceptions. 

<p>Some rural people have not 
seen a place for themselves in the urban-based movement. 
Many younger people are alienated by older peace 
activists who do not respect their creativity and self-organization. 
Many people of color and women are put off 
white male leadership of the movement, much as they 
were in the 1960s through the 1990s. 

<p>The culture of the peace movement is changing, 
however, as it broadens and deepens.  Whereas earlier 
rallies would only have folk musicians, the new 
peace movement is beginning to see the value of 
rap and punk artists.  We will need to reach out  to 
country and metal artists if we want to seriously 
reach rural Americans. And we need to respect the 
autonomy of people who want to organize their 
own social group or community without guidance 
from others. 

<p>Finally, a purely pacifist message is not necessarily always 
effective, particularly in military counterrecruitment. 
While many youths join the military for economic reasons, 
some actually do join the "Army of One" for the "adventure." 
Vietnam Veterans Against the War have encouraged 
some of these young people to instead go into 
martial arts to (more peacefully) gain a sense 
of confidence and self-worth. Other job fields, 
such as firefighting or political activism, can 
also fill the needs of energetic youth. They do not always 
need to adopt our peaceful values or images in order to act 
in the interest of peace. 

<p><b>Building a bridge to Iraqis </b>
<p>Besides, the problem is not simply that the U.S. is commiting 
violence in Iraq. It is also strangling Iraq's civilian economy, 
and weakening the ability of the Iraqi people to militantly oust 
their own dictator. Iraqis had successfully overthrown 
their monarchy in 1958. The U.S. backed Saddam's dictatorship during 
his war with Iran in the 1980s. After the 1991 Gulf War, 
it had a chance to back a popular uprising against Saddam, 
but let him crush the revolt, partly because a truly democratic 
government may have kept out Western oil companies. 
Washington instead preferred to work with exiled generals, 
bankers, and armed opposition factions that hate each other 
more than they hate Saddam. Independent Iraqi civilians 
are generally left out of the Pentagon's postwar schemes. 

<p>The peace movement can undermine 
this U.S. strategy not only by preventing an invasion of 
Iraq, but by morally supporting Iraqi civilians 
or soldiers if they again try to topple Saddam 
from below.  Last year, Iraqi mothers protested for 
an accounting of their "disappeared" sons and 
daughters, after Saddam released some of his 
opponents from prison. 

<p>This kind of Iraqi grassroots opposition, 
largely ignored by a Bush Administration hell-bent on 
a war, can be supported by the peace movement. In so doing, 
we can begin to build a bridge between our civilians and Iraqi 
civilians, against an escalation of the bombing and sanctions, 
as well as against the lack of self-determination 
inherent in both Saddam's brutal regime and the planned U.S. 
military administration of Iraq and its oil fields. 

<p><b>The movement's potential </b>
<p>The U.S. peace movement often underestimates its 
own potential. The movement (and GI resisters) 
helped to shorten the Vietnam War, by recognizing 
that our military could not defeat the Vietnamese. 
It prevented a full-scale invasion of Nicaragua and El Salvador 
in the 1980s, as it helped to end apartheid in South 
Africa. Although it failed to prevent wars against Iraq, 
Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, questions around the 
bombing of civilians (from home and abroad) 
may have ratcheted down the scale and duration of 
those wars, or prevented their escalation. 

<p>With millions marching around the world 
against a new Iraq War, joined by hundreds of thousands 
in the U.S., the global peace movement has a real chance 
to head off a full-scale invasion. Unlike before the first Gulf 
War, when its central message was to prevent U.S. military casualties, 
the new peace movement is more realistically focused on the 
effect of war and sanctions on Iraqi civilians. 

<p>Many Americans also understand that war will only increase 
their sense of insecurity (would you feel safer or 
less safe flying in an airplane in the weeks and months after 
an Iraq invasion?). The challenge will be to sustain the 
current opposition if the bombs begin to fall on Baghdad, 
and TV images of "surgical strikes" again lull the public 
into a sanitary view of war, as they did in 1991. 

<p>But seeing the long march on Menomonie's Main Street 
gave me a sense of hope today, just as great as seeing the 
huge DC crowds on CNN.  If local organizers can attract 
a following in a small Midwestern community, and let 
their neighbors know what invasion would mean 
for people in the Mideast, they will have made an 
amazing and important contribution to peace. Change 
always begins at home.
