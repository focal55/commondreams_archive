<p>WASHINGTON - What's that faint stirring we're hearing from Capitol Hill? Can it be that Congress is finally waking up to the fact the war's still going on, that we're fighting it for reasons other than the principal ones put forward by President Bush, and that his administration won't tell us what it's going to cost? 
<p>After blandly going along with the president's war resolution and invasion of Iraq, some of the good legislators seem to be coming around to the awareness that they and their brethren bought a pig in a poke without a price tag attached to its hoof. 

<p>The president's chief intellectual architect and salesman of the adventure, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, took his case to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the other day and ran into an uncommon torrent of criticism about what he has wrought. Also uncommonly these days, some Republicans joined Democrats in a bipartisan inquisition of the man who still insists on the basis of skimpy or nonexistent evidence that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with Osama bin Laden. 

<p>As they sought to extract from him how much the administration will have to pay for his brainchild, Mr. Wolfowitz blithely clung to his flawed rationale that the war wasn't about some imminent threat from weapons of mass destruction at all. It was about the Iraqi dictator's well-known beastliness. 


<p>Mr. Bush, meanwhile, has been keeping U.S. warships merely treading water off Liberia, whose strongman, Charles Taylor, has a reputation of comparable beastliness. From all reports, the Liberian people have suffered the same sort of mayhem Mr. Wolfowitz said justified pre-emptive war against Iraq. 

<p>In what a committee member called the administration's "shifting justification" for the invasion, Mr. Wolfowitz proclaimed that the war in Iraq was "the central battle in the war on terror." It's a theme that has also been expressed by the president and by Vice President Dick Cheney - obviously off the latest administration talking points. 

<p>Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island was blunt in sifting through the Wolfowitz chatter. All he was hearing in "a steady drumbeat," he said, was "weapons of mass destruction. ... So, I'll ask the question, Secretary Wolfowitz - What are we doing there?" 

<p>Mr. Wolfowitz replied that he and his administration sidekicks had always talked about what a bad guy Mr. Hussein was. Others will remember, however, that in the runup to the war, such references were distinctly secondary to the supposed imminent chemical and biological weapons threat that President Bush said required immediate action. 

<p>Another Republican, Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, despite his always reasonable manner, was not going to be put off by Mr. Wolfowitz about the cost of putting the Iraq Humpty Dumpty back together again. Mr. Lugar also wanted to know why the administration wasn't being more successful in bringing in peacekeeping troops from other countries. 

<p>Members of Mr. Bush's "coalition of the willing" have been dragging their feet, and as for the coalition of the unwilling that wouldn't back his war, the reason is all too obvious. Having called the United Nations "irrelevant," the president can't expect its members who opposed the invasion to enlist in the cleanup. 

<p>Mr. Wolfowitz allowed that the administration was willing to have such assistance "provided it does not put limitations" on the Iraq reconstruction being undertaken on an essentially unilateral basis by the president's on-site czar, L. Paul Bremer III. In other words, give us your bodies but keep your kibitzing to yourselves. 

<p>The deputy secretary observed at one point that "speed is of the essence here, and the U.N. isn't always speedy." Certainly its weapons inspectors weren't speedy enough for him in his eagerness to launch the invasion. The administration's subsequent search for the same weapons is not being clocked so impatiently at the Pentagon. 

<p>Meanwhile, Congress and the American taxpayers will have to be more patient waiting to find out not only where those weapons are, but also how much bigger a hole will be shot in the federal budget by this war of shifting justifications.
