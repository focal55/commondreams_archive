<p><i>"The whole of government consists in the art of being
honest"</i>
        -Thomas Jefferson

<p>The slick logo headlining the evening news proclaims "The Showdown with Saddam," while local radio offers up "The Lowdown on the Showdown."
<p>But don't expect to see the human reality of war-the burn victims and the bodies.  Expect touching stories of American
servicemen serving, and smart bombs obliterating fuzzy black-and-white targets.  This will be our evening diversion, our reward for paying taxes-$1 billion plus per day for the most awesome military machine ever to threaten the planet.
<p>And what will be the reward for those who command those
taxes, the Bush Junta?  Re-election?  Untold riches?
Prison?  We don't know, but we do know that things are not going exactly as planned.  Millions of the world's citizens are in the streets protesting, and news of this dissent is somehow reaching the American public.  Ordinary Americans are beginning to ask questions.  After the millions of tax dollars spent on "preparing public opinion," that wasn't supposed to happen.
<p>Of course the war planners want war, with or without public support, but they remember Vietnam, and they have openly vowed to not repeat the PR mistakes of the past.  There is a
joke going around in which Bush says, "Why should I care
what the American people think-they didn't vote for me!"
True enough, but he does care, for in the end, after all we have seen, we will vote again.
<p>I believe it is extremely important for the future of our society that we understand the significance of the propaganda war being waged on this country.  This assault on
truth is not just one piece of the political equation that
got us here--financially ruined and on the verge of war--it
is the primary reason we are here.  Change just one
thing--make truth readily available--and the political,
social and economic direction of this country will reverse itself.
<p>The Bush regime owes its existence to its ability to be believed and its capacity to manipulate the news, filter information, and operate in secrecy.  In a democracy it is no easy task to turn reality upside down, but the ministers of  truth have several important advantages.
<p>First, they have access to money.  As we know, their rise to
power was financed by the Who's Who of the conservative corporate world, by companies like Enron, that have since become household words.  Now in power, they use the government's offices and money to conduct their focus groups
and execute their information campaigns.
<p>Second, they enjoy the complicity of the news media.
Without this "fourth branch of government," the regime
simply could not function.   Most of the news that reaches
us is selected by the guardians of huge corporate conglomerates. "Selected" is the correct term, because these media functionaries decide such things as which stories will be covered, who will be allowed to speak and what the emphasis will be.  When the Turkish Parliament refused to allow American forces to attack Iraq from their soil-a stunning development deserving huge headlines-the story in the Denver Post did not appear on page one.  It did
not even appear on page two or three.  It was placed on page
27, behind a story about taxes in Alabama and another about
the 100th anniversary of the Hershey Chocolate factory.
<p>Third, the ministers of information have human nature as an ally.  We want to believe them and we like to give them the benefit of the doubt. We can be told the most obvious, breathtaking lies, and we will believe them.  George Bush gave a speech after September 11, explaining "why they hate us."  He said, "They hate our freedoms."  The fact that he was not simply laughed off the platform for that remark speaks volumes about the information gap we have in this country.
<p>Besides using our openness and trust to lie to us, Bush and
his lieutenants have been even more adept at appealing to
our darker instincts.  They play our fears and like a harp. They appeal to our most primitive patriotic tendencies. Rather than educate and uplift, they dumb down.  Of all the acts committed by this administration, the deliberate assassination of our humanity is by far the worst--worse than the graft, the greed, the lies, the plundering of the national treasury, and the violent, imperial approach toward
the world's citizens.  For me, their most inexcusable act as
leaders is intentionally teaching their fellow Americans to hate.

<p>How bad is the information gap?  My travel abroad has taught
me that among all the educated people in the world,
Americans have the poorest understanding of American foreign
policy.  In other words, educated Brits, Indians and
Argentines know more about the behavior of the United States
in the world than we do.  If I'm right, that is a stunning fact.

<p>How bad is it?  There may be no other country in the world where political lies are so readily swallowed.  Maybe only in North Korea, where the majority of the people have grown up in a true police state, it is worse.

<p>But as I said, things are not going as planned.  People all over the world are protesting, marching, and placing their bodies between the tanks and the truth.  Not just thousands,
not tens or even hundreds of thousands, but millions of
people are demanding that this rush to slaughter stop.

<p>Meanwhile, the sexy Fox and CNN military programs are
reviewing the troops and panning across the bristling
military hardware, their omission of the real news growing
ever more desperate.

<p>Columnist Molly Ivins asked the most relevant question I
have heard about the proposed slaughter:  "Do they get to
vote on it?"  Do the citizens of Baghdad get to choose
between living under a brutal dictator or getting burned
alive by us?  Maybe as a first step, to demonstrate our commitment to democracy in the region, we should let them vote on that one.
