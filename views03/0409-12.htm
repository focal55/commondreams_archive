<p>It was the picture of the day -- the toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue in 
Baghdad -- and may end up being the picture of the war, the single image
that comes to define the conflict. The message will be clear: The U.S. 
liberated the Iraqi people; the U.S. invasion of Iraq was just.

<p>On Wednesday morning television networks kept cameras trained on the statue 
near the Palestine Hotel. Iraqis threw ropes over the head and tried to 
pull it down before attacking the base with a sledgehammer. Finally a U.S. 
armored vehicle pulled it down, to the cheers of the crowd.

<p>It was an inspiring moment of celebration at the apparent end of a brutal 
dictator's reign. But as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has pointed 
out at other times, no one image tells the whole story. Questions arise 
about what is, and isn't, shown.

<p>One obvious question: During live coverage, viewers saw a U.S. soldier 
drape over the face of Hussein a U.S. flag, which was quickly removed and 
replaced with an Iraqi flag. Commanders know that the displaying the U.S. 
flag suggests occupation and domination, not liberation. NBC's Tom Brokaw 
reported that the Arab network Al Jazeera was "making a big deal" out of
the incident with the American flag, implying that U.S. television would
-- and should -- downplay that part of the scene. Which choice tells the more 
complete truth?

<p>Another difference between television in the U.S. and elsewhere has been
coverage of Iraqi casualties. Despite constant discussion of "precision 
bombing," the U.S. invasion has produced so many dead and wounded that 
Iraqi hospitals stopped trying to count. Red Cross officials have labeled 
the level of casualties "incredible," describing "dozens of totally 
dismembered dead bodies of women and children" delivered by truck to 
hospitals. Cluster bombs, one of the most indiscriminate weapons in the 
modern arsenal, have been used by U.S. and U.K. forces, with the British
defense minister explaining that mothers of Iraqi children killed would one 
day thank Britain for their use.

<p>U.S. viewers see little of these consequences of war, which are common on 
television around the world and widely available to anyone with Internet
access. Why does U.S. television have a different standard? CNN's Aaron 
Brown said the decisions are not based on politics. He acknowledged that
such images accurately show the violence of war, but defended decisions to 
not air them; it's a matter of "taste," he said. Again, which choice tells 
the more complete truth?

<p>Finally, just as important as decisions about what images to use are 
questions about what facts and analysis -- for which there may be no 
dramatic pictures available -- to broadcast to help people understand the 
pictures. The presence of U.S. troops in the streets of Baghdad means the 
end of the shooting war is near, for which virtually everyone in Iraq will 
be grateful. It also means the end of a dozen years of harsh U.S.-led 
economic sanctions that have impoverished the majority of Iraqis and killed 
as many as a half million children, according to U.N. studies, another 
reason for Iraqi celebration. And no doubt the vast majority of Iraqis are 
glad to be rid of Hussein, even if they remember that it was U.S. support 
for Hussein throughout the 1980s that allowed his regime to consolidate 
power despite a disastrous invasion of Iran.

<p>But that does not mean all Iraqis will be happy about the ongoing presence 
of U.S. troops. Perhaps they are aware of how little the U.S. government
has cared about democracy or the welfare of Iraqis in the past. Perhaps 
they watch Afghanistan and see how quickly U.S. policymakers abandoned the 
commitment to "not walk away" from the suffering of the Afghan people. 
Perhaps we should be cautious about what we infer from the pictures of 
celebration that we are seeing; joy over the removal of Hussein does not
mean joy over an American occupation.

<p>There is no simple way to get dramatic video of these complex political 
realities. But they remain realities, whether or not U.S. viewers find a
full discussion of them on television.
