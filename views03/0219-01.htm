<p> THIS MANY PEOPLE braving the ice might be the tip of the iceberg that blocks 
the war in Iraq. In New York, between 100,000 and 400,000 people, depending on 
police or organizer counts, clogged the streets last Saturday to protest against 
a US invasion of Iraq. They came despite a temperature of 25 and wind chills well 
below that. They came despite the arctic gusts of government censorship. New York's 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, his police department, and John Ashcroft's US Justice 
Department all ganged up in court to get a federal court order that prevented 
a march past the United Nations. The court order allowed the police to limit and 
freeze protesters in pens on First Avenue on the East Side and erect barricades 
to keep protesters coming from the west to join the throng. In a city that still 
allows massive ethnic parades (parties are OK, concern for human devastation is 
not), President Bush and his allies in local government won their goal of avoiding 
the politically embarrassing photo-op of hundreds of thousands of people marching 
past the symbol that Bush and the Republicans have trashed for two decades (Colin 
Powell inside the UN to call for war is OK, but citizens outside the UN calling 
for peace are not). 
<P> The attempt at icing the crowd in New York was silly compared with the rallies 
in Europe. In Rome, 600,000 people marched to St. John's Cathedral. In London, 
750,000 people marched to Hyde Park. In Berlin, 500,000 people marched toward 
the Brandenberg Gate. In Spain, at least 500,000 people demonstrated in Barcelona 
and at least 600,000 marched in Madrid. 
<P> The London demonstration -- England is America's biggest ally for a military 
strike against Iraq -- was the largest political demonstration in the nation's 
history. The turnout at the Brandenberg Gate was the largest German political 
rally since World War II. The 70,000 in Amsterdam was the largest demonstration 
in that city since antinuclear rallies in the 1980s. The 200,000 protesters in 
Sydney, Australia, was that city's biggest rally since Vietnam. 
<P> Though the demonstrators in New York were denied a march and the opportunity 
to make a supercharged symbolic statement, there were some critical things the 
government could not stop. Newspaper photographs and interviews of participants 
revealed a broad range of Americans by color, age, religion, and profession (some 
even waved American flags), all urging Bush to find a peaceful solution to Saddam 
Hussein's weapons program. 
<P> Just when you thought the only thing apathetic Americans ventured into the 
cold for were football games, skiing, and Christmas shopping, the thousands of 
people who came to New York despite the pens and barricades created a new optimism. 
Surely many more would have come if it had been warmer in temperature and in welcome 
by a government that claims that it wants to invade Iraq for our ''freedom.'' 
<P> It raises the possibility that the closer we get to war, the more Americans 
will march away from a first-strike war. The February polls still show that we 
have been convinced that an invasion is ultimately necessary. According to the 
New York Times/CBS poll, the CNN/USA Today poll, the ABC/Washington Post poll, 
the Newsweek poll, and the Fox News poll, between 63 and 70 percent of Americans 
favor military action, while only 23 to 34 percent are opposed. 
<P> But in the same polls, a majority of Americans have also called for patience. 
In the polls, between 56 and 59 percent of respondents say the United States should 
get approval from the UN before invading Iraq, while only between 37 to 39 percent 
say it is important for the United States to invade quickly, even without international 
support. 
<P> Those numbers mean that all the speeches by Bush and all the talk-show appearances 
by Secretary of State Powell, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and National 
Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice out to galvanize Americans behind an invasion 
have only gone so far. Despite two years of declaring on so many occasions that 
the United States has a divine right to ignore the rest of the world, Americans 
are showing that we really are concerned as to how the world would view us if 
we were to abuse the power in a unilateral, unprovoked war. 
<P> The demonstrators were the best demonstration yet of that concern, despite 
the icy winds and icy reception by the government and despite the downplaying 
of rallies earlier this winter by several major newspapers. Bush and New York 
tried to pen them in, but by their numbers, the people who came to say no to war 
moved the nation a step closer to lassoing Bush. Bush now has to choose whether 
to ignore the tip of the iceberg or proceed full steam ahead, just as once did 
the arrogant operators of the Titanic.
