<p>President Bush stated recently, "We've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with September the 11th."  Yet in a recent Washington Post poll it was determined that 70% of Americans believed that it was likely that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the September 11 attacks.  So from where did this belief arise?  It has been documented that immediately after September 11, 2001 members of the Bush administration saw the tragedy as an opportunity to settle scores with Iraq.  Although the Bush administration never explicitly said that Iraq was behind the September 11 mass murder it continually tried to link Saddam Hussein with Al-Qaeda, as part of its justification for the war in Iraq.  The President and others explicitly used what happened on September 11 as a reason for the invasion of Iraq.  His administration was helped in its effort to create a link between Iraq and September 11 by Republican Congressmen and propaganda from a certain segment of the media.
<p>It has happened before.
<p>Two quick statements:  The Spanish-American War began because the Spanish sank an American battleship, the U.S.S. Maine, in Havana harbor in February 1898.  The United States was never an overseas colonial power.

<p>Both statements are untrue.  The second statement is but one of the many oft-repeated lies of Oliver North.
<p>This is not revisionist history.  Although the truth cannot now be determined for certain, the study of Admiral Rickover published by the Naval History Division of the US Department of the Navy concluded that the cause of the explosions that destroyed the Maine was a fire in its own coal bunker.  There was NEVER any evidence that the Spanish were behind the attack.  Indeed, the Captain of the Maine reported that the Spanish officers and crews of nearby ships helped rescue the survivors.  Nevertheless, the "yellow press," especially the Journal published by William Randolph Hearst-the FOX News/talk radio of its day-declared with certainty that the Spanish were behind the tragedy.  They also trumpeted and exaggerated the authentic horrors of the Spanish "reconcentration camp" policy for suppressing the Cuban Independence rebellion.

<p>The Maine was originally sent to Havana, because of concern about the endangerment of American economic interests in Cuba.  Americans controlled an important natural resource in Cuba-vast sugar plantations.  Our involvement in Cuba was propelled by the political interests of Congressional Republicans who were concerned about the 1898 elections.  Nothing is more effective at fooling people in the short-term into supporting the party in power than a war.  Interestingly, a Republican Senator from Indiana was a leading skeptic on intervention in Cuba.  The Republican McKinley administration, which came to power in an election that is considered the first where the political contributions of big business purchased a presidential victory, demanded concessions on Cuba, to most of which the Spanish government acceded, and then declared war on Spain.  The Pope and most of the European powers (but not Great Britain to any great extent) opposed the war.
<p>As a result of victory in the war, America acquired Cuba (soon granted formal independence), Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  The United States then suppressed an insurrection in the Philippines led by the shifty character Emilio Aguinaldo (who the US had returned to the Philippines to fight the Spanish in a move that is similar to the Reagan-era support for Saddam Hussein and the arming and training of Islamic fundamentalists that are at root of our current problems).  The US Army adopted the approaches of the Spanish in Cuba for the suppression of the Philippines and then retained them as an overseas colony.  More American soldiers died in the suppression of the Philippine insurrection than died in the Spanish-American War.  Conservative estimates indicate that the number of Philippine civilians who died in the war (200,000) was similar to that of the Cuban civilians who died as a result of Spanish policies.  The Philippines did not become independent until 1946.

<p>The parallels to our current entanglement in Iraq are obvious.  False pretenses and domestic political motivation for going to war, inflammatory propaganda from a segment of the media and suppression of dissent, demands for concessions and American rejection of their acceptance as inadequate, disdain for international opinion and enthrallment to natural resource interests, a quick war and prolonged suppression of a resistant native population, damaged American credibility and more American casualties after than during the war. 

<p>"REMEMBER THE MAINE!"  But learn from the whole story.
