<p>To suggest that there isn't enough religion in America's public sphere is akin to suggesting that Americans aren't fat. It is wishful thinking in reverse, a sort of opportunistic denial, like Richard Simmons hollering that he's run out of thighs to prune. His corpulent faithfuls all over the land would start piling on extra cellulite just to reassure him.
Claim that God is missing from the public square, as the odd southern ayatollah warns with seasonal regularity, and believers will fill stadiums' worth of self-disproving prophesies.

<p>Religion is the cholesterol in our civic diet, second only to advertising as the senses' permanent clog. Whether you want it or not it is ladled out just about anywhere. It is every politician's six-shooter, every athlete's steroid, every everyman's flack jacket and every white noise's continuo.

<p>So Alabama's Roy Moore and his Ten Commandments crusade was less an aberration than a variation on a traditional theme. That posting one-liner moralisms in courthouse lobbies or on schoolhouse walls supposedly reduces the murder rate, the incidence of wife beating, teen pregnancies or high taxes is an appealing shortcut. It's always easier to call on spiritual welfare than pull one's social responsibilities by the bootstraps and actually work to make others' lives more bearable, or put up the money that may help make a difference (those taxes again), even if some of it is wasted along the way.

<p>Preaching costs nothing and sounds terrifically proper. But the notion that a more pious nation is a more morally responsible or caring nation is a bit of a stretch.

<p>High taxes aside, those social indicators (crime, teen pregnancies etc.) are healthiest in Europe -- where, as George Orwell put it, most people feel "a sort of frozen disgust" when they hear the word "God." Yet where religion is not only in the public sphere but down your throat and often across it, -- think Taliban, think Saudi Arabia, think Iran -- life is less lived than feared.

<p>Admittedly, opposing religious influence in the public sphere purely for anti-clerical reasons would only amount to reverse dogmatism, and so would be just as obstructive as its opposite. But the question not asked enough whenever a demagogue like Moore makes a crutch of the Commandments is not whether religion could add anything to public life, but whether that kind of doctrine -- the Commandments -- is anything we'd want to hang our hopes on.

<p>To begin with, there are the obvious fallacies people like Moore peddle to make the Commandments mean more than they do in America's legal tradition. The Commandments do find their way in the Constitution's genealogy, but barely. "Thou shalt not steal" and "Thou shalt not bear false witness" mirror the Constitution's reverence for property and due process, and the bits about coveting and adultery have inspired author John Updike's entire oeuvre. But it'd be hard to find any of the other commandments having even an imagined resemblance to anything constitutional. The document was certainly influenced by Montesquieu, Locke and Machiavelli, by Plutarch, Livy and Cicero to some extent, even by John Calvin, given the Founders' bleak view of human nature. But Moses? Hardly.

<p>Moore would have been safer posting the Bill of Rights in public places if it's legal historicism he was looking for. But he wasn't. The problem with the Ten Commandments as pin-up is that it is a bunch of "Thou shalt nots" -- negative reinforcements as outdated as parenting by the whip. Posting them has little to do with making life better for your fellow-man, with seeking out a little justice for those less lucky than you, with nurturing a bit of equity for those not as wealthy as you. It is moralism by cudgel, and responsibility on the cheap.

<p>I don't think most people would object to the display of moral codes if they were backed up by deeds. An instructive alternative to the Moore commandments is Samuel Milton Jones, better known as "Golden Rule" Jones, the great mayor of Toledo at the turn of the last century. Judging by his nickname, preaching morality to other people might have been his avocation. But as a manufacturer of oil well machinery, wrote historian James MacGregor Burns in "The Workshop of Democracy" (Knopf, 1985), Jones "posted the Golden Rule in his plant and instituted the eight-hour day, a minimum wage, vacations with full pay, Christmas bonuses; he forbade child labor, timekeepers, and piecework. As mayor of Toledo, he supported municipal ownership of utilities, free kindergartens, public playgrounds, free concerts; he made the police swap their police clubs for light canes and he disapproved arresting on suspicion and holding without charge."

<p>In short, he practiced what he preached. Unlike Moore and his fans he did not orbit above the law or with the angels. He was concerned with the demands of the here and now. He was a man of his deeds.
