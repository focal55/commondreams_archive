<p>As Time Warner begins the process of renegotiating its franchise 
agreement with the city of Portland, much of the coverage in the Press 
Herald has focused on cable television. And for good reason.
<p>City residents have no cable choice but Time Warner, and since 1996 the 
cost of its service has risen three times faster than inflation.
<p>But a far more serious long-term issue for Portland residents and 
Maine's economy is Time Warner's stranglehold on broadband cable 
Internet service.
<p>The Internet as we know it developed within a framework of "open 
access." That is, people could choose their own Internet service 
provider (ISP), view any Web site and transmit any information they desired.
<p>Open access did not happen by chance but rather by regulation. Many 
years ago, the Federal Communications Commission required that, for a 
reasonable fee, local phone companies allow their wires to be used by 
rival ISPs to provide Internet service.
<p>The result was robust competition. More than 7,000 ISPs sprang up 
nationwide. Competitive, low-cost service ushered in rapid growth. Open 
access ensured that the Internet developed as a diverse, free-flowing 
and democratic medium.
<p>Today, most people still access the Internet through a dial-up modem. 
But dial-up is rapidly being supplanted by broadband. Broadband is many 
times faster and allows users to view high-resolution streaming video, 
download graphics-rich Web sites and utilize new real-time interactive 
applications and services.
<p>Broadband service can be provided through a cable network, or through a 
digital subscriber line (DSL) that runs on the local phone network, or 
by satellite.
<p>Rather than extend open access rules to broadband, the Bush 
administration issued regulations last March that allow cable companies 
to lock out rival ISPs. A few months later, the administration proposed 
lifting the open access rules for DSL lines as well.
<p>This means that just two companies - Time Warner and Verizon, which 
offers DSL - could control Portland's broadband service for the 
foreseeable future.
<p>The administration says its policies are necessary to ensure that big 
cable and telephone companies have an incentive to roll out broadband 
service nationwide. But about 80 percent of all households are already 
linked to one or more types of broadband infrastructure. There's no 
indication that heightened competition will slow deployment.
<p>The administration also argues that people will be able to choose among 
different kinds of broadband (DSL, cable or satellite) and this will 
provide sufficient competition. But satellite service has technological 
limitations that render it less than ideal. That leaves at best a duopoly.
<p>Lack of competition means higher prices. Even worse, the lack of 
nondiscriminatory open access rules will allow broadband providers like 
Time Warner to inhibit or block access to certain Web sites.
<p>This is no far-fetched conspiracy theory. Cisco Systems, a leading 
network equipment manufacturer, issued a memo to providers recently 
explaining that Cisco tools can "restrict the incoming . . . broadcasts 
(from competitors) as well as subscriber's outgoing access to the . . . 
site to discourage its use. At the same time, you could promote and 
offer your own or partner's services with full-speed features to 
encourage adoption of your service."
<p>Time Warner could thus transmit its own content and the content of 
affiliated companies at high speeds while slowing or blocking access to 
rival sites.
<p>The economic implications are severe. Imagine if a private corporation 
controlled the highways and allowed affiliated companies to truck their 
goods in the fast lane while rivals were restricted to a snail's pace. 
We would never stand for it - nor should we allow the Internet, another 
key piece of economic infrastructure, to be similarly hijacked.
<p>The First Amendment implications are even more chilling. While phone 
companies are prohibited from interfering with a citizen's right to call
(or access through a dial-up modem) anybody he or she wishes, these same
protections have not been extended to broadband.

<p>With Time Warner in control, how long will we be able to view sites 
criticizing big media companies or advocating open access or lower cable
rates? Unfortunately, federal laws bar Portland from requiring open 
access as part of Time Warner's franchise renewal.

<p>The City Council, however, chould pass a strong resolution calling on 
the federal government to revise its policies and adopt open access. A 
resolution could bring attention to the issue and perhaps spur our 
congressional delegation to action.
