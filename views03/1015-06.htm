<p> During the Bush administration, presidential nominations have proved a political battle zone, and the latest struggle over the nomination of Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has been no exception. On October 1, Democrats on a Senate committee boycotted a vote on Mr. Leavitt's nomination because he hadn't fully answered their questions on both his mixed environmental record and the Bush administration's dismal record.

 

<p>Speaking recently at an Environmental Law Institute seminar in Washington, former EPA administrators Carol Browner and William Reilly recognized that Democrats had seized an important opportunity to make the administration accountable. 

 

<p>Indeed, the administration has not been quite forthcoming about the effects of its environmental rollbacks; there are many instances where the administration has either withheld information or approved harmful policies behind Americans' backs:

 
<p><b>Factory Farm Exemptions
</b>
<p>Documents leaked to the Sierra Club demonstrate that the administration had been secretly negotiating with agribusiness lobbyists on a proposal that could enable gigantic farms to pollute indefinitely without facing lawsuits. They would pay a mere one-time $500 penalty plus $2,500 fee per farm for violating clean air standards. The money would finance - what else! - an air monitoring program.

 

<p>Factory farms not only produce tons of waste from hogs, chickens and cows on a daily basis, but also emit large amounts of air pollution in the form of soot, chemicals that come from smog, and toxic gases such as ammonia. The pollutants have resulted in numerous health problems for neighboring communities including headaches, excessive coughing, diarrhea and burning eyes.

 
<p><b>Clean Air Roll Backs
</b>
<p>In late August, when Congress was out and when many Americans were taking relaxing vacations in the fresh air, the EPA relaxed clean air rules. This latest stunt from the Bush administration modifies an anti-pollution provision known as New Source Review (NSR) and permits thousands of utilities to pollute more.

<p>Administration officials have tried to mask this corporate give-away as a revision that will make it easier for corporations to navigate complicated and unclear regulations. In reality, the new initiative creates a loophole in what constitutes "routine maintenance," potentially exempting power plants and utilities from ever having to install anti-pollution devices when undergoing upgrades.

<p>According to a recent Public Citizen report, Bush officials made untrue statements to two Senate committees about the consequences of the NSR change. Clean air administrator Jeffrey Holmstead claimed that enforcement officials informed him that the revision would not undercut ongoing lawsuits against companies that had violated NSR. In fact, in meetings attended by Holmstead, enforcement officials had expressed the contrary. Moreover, companies facing lawsuits have already begun citing the rule change as part of their defense. 

<p><b>Harmful Cost-Benefit Approaches
</b>
<p>A government agency called the Office of Management and Budget has been advocating sneaky procedures that could weaken environmental and health regulations by devaluing human lives. One proposed analysis calculates seniors are worth 37% less than younger people. Another goes against traditional government methodology of valuing whole human lives and only values the remaining years of a life. Not only does this approach favor younger people (with more years left) than seniors, but it also devalues other sectors of the population facing life shortening diseases (who also have fewer years left to live). The Truth about Global Warming Not only has the Bush administration refused to acknowledge that global warming is real but it also suppressed scientific evidence that doesn't serve its interests. Recently, the EPA deleted a section on global warming in a comprehensive state of the environment report. Additionally, the EPA decided against regulating carbon dioxide gas, a major contributor to global warming.

<p><b>Post 9/11 Air Quality at Ground Zero
</b>
<p>After the 9/11 attacks, the White House failed to notify the public about the EPA's warnings about air quality and public health at and around Ground Zero, endangering the lives of thousands of survivors, firefighters and rescue workers. Cleanup and emergency workers have continued to complain of respiratory problems since 2001, experiencing what is often called the "World Trade Center cough."


<p>The Bush administration's deft maneuvering around clean air protections should come as nothing new. This is the same administration that has misled us on U.S. intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the costs of a long-term occupation. The Democrats could end their boycott soon and Leavitt will very likely be confirmed. Recent events, nonetheless, demonstrate that while we should continue to raise questions about the administration's foreign policy, we should also make every effort to bring its environmental record to light.
