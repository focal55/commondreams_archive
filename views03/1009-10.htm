<p>COLORADO SPRINGS - Iraq is not a quagmire. 

<p>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld wants to make that very clear. On Tuesday, he told several thousand Fort Carson soldiers and their families that calling Iraq a quagmire was just "flat wrong."

<p>At a news conference Wednesday during a NATO seminar at The Broadmoor resort, Rumsfeld reinforced the point by finding something wrong with almost every question reporters asked about Iraq.

<p>A French journalist, for instance, was wrong to say there had been a "poor response" to the U.S. request for other nations' troops to help in postwar Iraq.

<p>"The response," Rumsfeld declared, "has been excellent."

<p>Right now, 130,000 American troops serve in Iraq. Collectively, the rest of the world has provided 24,000, most of them British. Twelve-month tours are now the rule for U.S. service people in Iraq.

<p>These are the longest combat deployments since Vietnam. But this time around, there is no hiding in the Reserves. American reservists have been called to active duty by the thousands.

<p>But response by other nations to help in Iraq has been excellent. A dozen NATO countries, which until the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks had never sent troops outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's borders, actually have soldiers in Iraq, Rumsfeld emphasized.


<p>The term "poor response" is just more media mumbo-jumbo.

<p>"All of this myth about responses and the U.S. going it alone is just that - a myth," Rumsfeld said.

<p>Sort of like the hype created by reporters over a new chain of command for rebuilding Iraq. The secretary of defense wanted to make it perfectly clear that his authority has not been diminished by a White House initiative that puts national security adviser Condoleezza Rice in charge of rebuilding Iraq.

<p>No big deal, Rumsfeld said Wednesday. Sure, he didn't see the memo. But, he said, the decision was so minor the memo wasn't important enough to reach someone of his stature.

<p>It would be wrong to assume these changes in any way represent a reaction to an operation that isn't going as expected. Why, in the past four months, the U.S. has created an Iraqi security force from scratch, the secretary said. Sure, it cost U.S. taxpayers billions in a bad economy. But, Mr. Secretary said the security force went from zero to 56,000.

<p>"The goal of the coalition is not to become the permanent provider of security in that area," of the world, Rumsfeld said.

<p>hat's saying something.

<p>On the other hand, no one can say when Iraq's crack new military will be able to take over the protection of its countrymen, except that it will be years. Meanwhile, three to six American soldiers die each week in Iraq, and dozens more are wounded. Fort Carson, where Rumsfeld told listeners that things are going according to plan, ranks third in the country for fatalities, based on the number of troops committed.

<p>Still, Rumsfeld emphasized, American commanders don't want or need more U.S. troops, because no one wants to create the impression of an occupation.

<p>That would be wrong.

<p>It would be a notion as misbegotten as the one proffered by a reporter from England. He speculated that the lack of U.N. involvement in postwar Iraq might have some negative effect on an upcoming international summit of countries that might donate money to help pay for the reconstruction of Iraq.

<p>He was, of course, wrong.

<p>The U.S. invaded Iraq without the United Nations' blessing. The current failure to get members of the U.N. Security Council to agree on a plan for postwar Iraq might affect troop commitments, Rummy ruminated, but probably not donors. Remember, Mr. Secretary reminded, "we believe the basic task of rebuilding Iraq belongs to the Iraqis."

<p>he international community has a big interest in seeing Iraq rebuilt, Rumsfeld added.

<p>The role of the international community, especially the United States, is just to get things started, Rumsfeld proclaimed. Other countries have already given "hundreds of millions" to the cause.

<p>That compares with the $20.3 billion in emergency funds the Bush administration now wants U.S. taxpayers to pony up in order to fix roads and bridges and running water and electricity and oil and a bunch of other stuff we destroyed while running Saddam Hussein off to parts unknown.

<p>If you think those numbers are skewed, you're wrong.

<p>You have it from the highest authority.

<p>A man who wouldn't know a quagmire if he was stuck in one.
