<p>So much for American unilateralism.

<p>As our strategic doctrine of choice, unilateralism had a one-year run, from one Labor Day to the next. A year ago the administration announced we had both the right and the might to run the world free from the constraints of entangling alliances or multinational accords.

<p>George W. Bush didn't repudiate that right in his speech to the nation on Sunday, but he did allow how we didn't have the might.

<p>Grudgingly, to be sure. The current number of U.S. troops in Iraq, he said, was "appropriate to their mission"; then he asked other nations to come up with another division. Apparently, our mission in Iraq is to be one division short of providing adequate security for that nation's reconstruction.

<p>In this administration, the definition of a U.N. supporter is a unilateralist who's been mugged by reality. How far Bush is willing to go to entice other nations into the joys of nation-building is not at all clear. France and other critics of our war will doubtless demand that postwar Iraq be placed under the United Nations' political authority -- a position at which Bush will balk. But he needs other nations' troops to be patrolling the streets of Baghdad, especially because it's inconceivable that other nations' money will be made available to fund the occupation.

<p>Like Lyndon Johnson, Bush has gotten us stuck in a no-win conflict in a distant land, and, as they did during Johnson's war, the American people know it. The action, thankfully, is nowhere near so bloody now as it was then, and partly for that reason hardly anyone is demanding, as Americans did of Johnson, that Bush bring all the troops home right now. The American left as well as the American right understands that we have a moral obligation to help rebuild Iraq, though liberals believe that task will be more readily accomplished when under a genuinely international aegis.

<p>There will be arguments over how to come up with an additional $87 billion for Iraq but not, I suspect, much argument over our obligation to provide substantial funding for reconstruction. Even if we strike a deal with the French and persuade the Pakistanis to stand guard over the oil pipelines, it will be U.S. taxpayers who'll finance the sentry duty.

<p>ut stuck is stuck, and the American people do not take kindly to leaders who squander U.S. lives and treasure for a cause that seems remote from U.S. interests. As Johnson did with Vietnam, Bush sought to depict the current action in Iraq as necessary to safeguarding our shores.

<p>"We are fighting that enemy in Iraq and Afghanistan today so that we do not meet him again on our own streets, in our own cities," Bush said. The president will have to deliver a more persuasive speech than he did Sunday, however, if he's to convince Americans that our checkpoints in Tikrit somehow enhance our homeland security. The diehard Baathists who likely are attacking our soldiers plainly have no agenda outside Iraq, and if al Qaeda is now operating there, it's because we have turned our troops, and supporters of the reconstruction efforts, into sitting ducks for religious fanatics.

<p>When it comes to justifying the financial costs of the war, Bush's hand is actually weaker than LBJ's was. Johnson argued that the United States could afford guns and butter simultaneously, that we could find the resources to save Vietnam from communism even as we built the Great Society -- establishing Medicare and federal aid to education -- here at home. Bush must argue that we can afford guns and tax cuts, that we can find the resources to reconstruct Iraq, though we must neglect the reconstruction of our power grid and our health care system so that we can shower the rich in trillion-dollar tax giveaways. Worse, he must argue for funding the aftermath of his war even as the constant decline in American jobs continues apace, and he seems powerless to arrest it.


<p>he nervousness that suddenly hangs over the Bush White House is well deserved: The president has lost control of the situation he created in Iraq and of the American economy as well. It is not Bush's fault that this is the first truly global recovery, that American corporations now rebound by hiring (when they hire at all) abroad rather than in the States.

<p>It is most certainly Bush's fault, however, that there is no funding to put people to work rebuilding our various tattered infrastructures because he has squandered it all on the rich.

<p>Stuck in Iraq, stuck at home and the polling shows that the American people increasingly realize it and lay the blame on Bush.

<p><i>Unilaterally.
