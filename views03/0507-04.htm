<p>It is called the "Capitalist Woodstock" - the annual event at which billionaire Warren Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, dispense sage advice on how to invest. About 15,000 people travel each year to Omaha, Neb., for the event. And it is a safe bet that most arrive carrying dreams of growing as wealthy as Buffett and Munger, whose firm, Berkshire Hathaway, earned $1.7 billion in the first three months of this year. 

<p>It is not a safe bet, however, that everyone who trekked to Omaha heard the sage advice from Buffett and Munger. And it is a virtual certainty that the economic warlocks who guide the Bush administration's policymaking heard nary a word of Buffett's lecture. 

<p>That's because, with his recent suggestions that capitalism should have a conscience, Buffett is "off message." Instead of letting his greed get the better of him and endorsing the president's proposal to cut another $550 billion in taxes for the super-rich, Buffett rejected the scheme as the madness that it is. 

<p>"I am not for the Bush (tax) plan," Buffett told the crowd in Omaha. "It screams of injustice." 

<p>Buffett objected to the inherent unfairness of President Bush's plan, which he said "will result in us (himself and Munger) giving a smaller percentage of our income to Washington than the people who work in our shoe factory." 

<p>Buffett and Munger rejected the suggestion that the tax cuts would strengthen the economy. "This is not going to stimulate the economy. It will stimulate us," Buffett said, referring to his wealthy partner and himself. 

<p>The U.S. economy, notes Buffett, has been in a recessionary cycle for the past two years - a period roughly parallel to the time since Bush's first round of tax cuts for the country club class were enacted. 

<p>Buffett suggested that the economy would be better served by a shareholder revolt against inflated pay and benefits for corporate officers. "We have seen more misdirected (CEO) compensation in the last five years than in the previous 100," said the man who is hailed as the sage of Omaha. "There was a wealth transfer like never before." 

<p>Even when CEOs fail, they are paid more, Buffett noted. "It's a bad system," he added. 

<p>As troubling as a CEO compensation system that redistributes wealth upward, Munger says, is the embrace by U.S. corporations of deceptive accounting standards. "The quality of accounting in America is terrible. It is too optimistic. People pay attention to the audited numbers, not the reality. If the accounting is lousy, then business decisions are lousy." 

<p>Which brings us back to the Bush tax cut proposal. Conservative Republicans - and even a few moderate Democrats - are always quick to say that they want to run government like a business. The problem is that, with a plan that runs deficits up while eliminating sources of revenue, the Bush administration is adopting the worst practices of American corporations. 

<p>Instead of following the Enron example, the Bush team might want to heed the advice of a business leader who is actually successful. Of course, that would require a big leap: Bush and his aides would need to recognize that the sort of conscience-free capitalism they practice is merely greed - the sort of greed that, invariably, destroys businesses, and nations.
