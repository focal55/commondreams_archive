<p>In recent weeks U.S. officials have made a
series of remarkably unfriendly statements against
the government of Venezuela, and its President
Hugo Chavez. This breach of diplomatic norms can
only serve to worsen relations between the two
countries. It also provokes resentment in Latin
America -- in the same way that the Bush
administration's decision to disregard the United
Nations and invade Iraq lowered our standing
throughout the world.

<p> "I think that some of the things that he
[Chavez] has done at home politically and his
policies on the economic side, has ruined what is a
relatively wealthy country," said Roger Noriega, the
State department's top diplomat for the Americas.
This statement is ironic, since Venezuela's current
recession is mainly a result of the 64-day oil strike
organized in December and January by opposition
leaders seeking to overthrow the government. The
State Department did not criticize this strike nor ask
its friends in the opposition to desist from it, even

though the Bush administration was preparing for
war in the Middle East and had a strong interest in
maintaining the flow of oil from Venezuela, the
world's fifth largest oil exporter.

<p>U.S. officials have also made a number of
statements indicating support for a referendum to
recall President Chavez. This is in sharp contrast to
the Bush administration's position on the California referendum. When Republicans were gathering signatures to recall Governor Gray Davis, the Bush team remained studiously neutral.

<p>In addition, U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela
Charles Shapiro violated diplomatic protocol by
meeting with the country's newly appointed
electoral commission last week , even before the
commission had met with the government. He
offered "assistance" with the commission's work,
including their first task of deciding whether to
accept the opposition's recall petition. The petition
was subsequently rejected unanimously by the
commission, with even the opposition members
abstaining.

<p>Administration officials have also made
statements, without offering any evidence,
indicating that the Chavez government is supporting
the guerillas in neighboring Colombia. And in July
our government cut off U.S. Export-Import Bank
credits to Venezuela.

<p>Chavez has responded angrily to these
statements and actions, telling our government "not

to meddle" in Venezuela's internal affairs. Noriega,
in turn, accused Chavez of "unrelenting hostility" to
the United States.

<p>But how would the Bush Administration
react if the president of France, for example, were
to call for the impeachment of President Bush?
Clearly it is Washington's hostility to Venezuela
that is causing the problem.

<p>In fact, the Bush Administration openly
supported the military coup against President
Chavez in April 2002, reversing its stance after it
became clear that the United States was
diplomatically isolated.

<p>Our government's clear pro-opposition bias,
as well as its lack of respect for democracy and
national sovereignty in Venezuela, prevents it from
playing any positive role in resolving political
conflicts there. Nor is such intervention necessary.

<p> Venezuela is a democracy, with complete
freedom of the press, speech, assembly and
association. In spite of Washington's support for the
military coup last year, the Chavez government has
done its best to maintain friendly relations with the
United States. It is our third largest trading partner
in Latin America, and has always -- except during
the opposition's oil strike -- been a reliable energy
supplier.

<p>The Bush Administration's policies are
destabilizing Venezuela, politically and
economically. This is wrong and dangerous, and has
the potential to push the country towards civil war.
There needs to be more pressure on the Bush team
here in the United States to change course, before it
creates another foreign policy disaster.
