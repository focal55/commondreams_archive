<p>PATRIOT GUT CHECK (Vol. 1, No. 1)<br>
LOCATION: A one-room meeting hall in a suburb near you.<br>
TIME: 10 p.m.

<p>OK, people - settle down, settle down. I've called you here because our 
president, whom we all hold in our prayers every morning and night, has just 
thrown us a mighty big surprise. OK, I shouldn't say surprise, because that 
word indicates weakness to all enemies of patriotism far and near. No, our 
president has given us, his loyal supporters, an unexpected challenge. Each of us has lawn signs and bumper stickers that say "Liberate Iraq." For 
months, we've stood behind those words with concrete American grit and 
might. Well, in the likelihood you haven't yet choked down this piece of
news, our coalition forces, who invaded Iraq and fought so bravely to 
liberate it, say they now plan to control Iraq indefinitely and not let the 
Iraqis govern themselves, at least not any time soon.<p>
See what I'm driving at here, people? This means we aren't leaving Iraq. Our 
coalition forces are now occupying forces. That stands in direct 
contradiction to our lawn signs and bumper stickers.<p>
I'm sorry to be so blunt about this, but I've consulted my dictionary and 
there's no two ways around it. According to ol' Webster, liberate is a verb 
that means "to set free, as from oppression, confinement or foreign 
control."<p>
People, our forces are now a source of foreign control in Iraq. Some might 
make the case we're also oppressing and confining the Iraqis, but I am not 
about to fuel our enemies on the foreign and domestic battlefields by 
splitting hairs in this time of crisis.<p>
What I'm worried about is this - we can't call for the liberation of Iraq if 
our president no longer wishes to liberate Iraq. If we support our 
president, which I'm certain we all are prepared to do to our apocalyptic 
deaths, if our president deems that necessary, then we must do something
about these signs and stickers.<p>
One might suggest we simply remove them. I, for one, do not see that as the 
appropriate course. Lest you've forgotten, the signs also say "Support Our 
Troops." There's also the little issue of the American flag next to 
"Liberate Iraq." At the very least, these are conflicting sentiments. Taking the signs down would leave us vulnerable to the accusation our 
patriotism runs hot and cold. It would also confuse us patriots. I mean, are 
we still supporting our troops, even if our troops are a foreign, 
controlling force in Iraq, which we wanted to liberate but now apparently 
don't? People, this is a mess.<p>
Apparently, some of us put up the "Liberate Iraq" signs without ever caring 
one lick about liberating Iraq. Indeed, if you're like me, we fear a truly 
liberated Iraq, because only God knows who or what form of murderous evil 
will emerge from a country completely independent of United States rule. I'm going to come clean and candid about this - in all honesty, this talk of 
liberation came out of the blue. Up until about a year ago, I had no idea 
Iraq was even a problem anymore. Rush wasn't talking about Iraq. Bill 
O'Reilly wasn't talking about Iraq. Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld and General
Powell weren't discussing Iraq on any of the Sunday morning chatter shows. But Mr. Bush declared Iraq a danger, so Iraq was a danger. Mr. Bush told us 
Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda were connected, so Saddam must have had 
something to do with September 11. Was Saddam plotting to launch poisonous 
missiles at us? I didn't know about it until our president told us so. So 
when Mr. Bush announced it was time for regime change, damn it, it was time 
for regime change.<p>
Our president's word was all we needed before and it's certainly all we need 
now. Our confusion over Mr. Bush's message is in no way his fault. He's a 
cunning, calculatedly compassionate leader. No, it's our fault we didn't
make signs large enough to hold all the nuances of his complex goals. We can point fingers all we want, but I'm going to follow my political 
party's lead and refuse to dwell on mistakes, let alone learn from them or, 
heaven forbid, admit to them. Our adversaries, ungodly and peace-loving 
alike, would only interpret that as further weakness.<p>
I have received neither divine guidance nor approval from the Bush 
administration on this, but until we receive official word, here's my 
suggestion - let's keep the signs and stickers right where they are and 
simply whitewash the word "Liberate."<p>
This solves two problems: It keeps our American flag and support for our
troops right where they should be - on the lawns and pickups of true-blue 
American families - and it clears space on the signs for Mr. Bush's next
policy verb on Iraq.<p>
Remember, when it comes to our president, as it does with our bibles, ours 
is not to question why. Ours is simply to obey and pray. Now, who's got 
paint?
