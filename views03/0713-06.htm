<p>Most whistleblowers are nervous wrecks. Exposing fraud or wrongdoing creates enemies, and most seek anonymity once the deed is done. Upsetting the status quo is a pursuit you don't do twice.<P></P>Unless you are American physicist Theodore Postol.<P></P>In which case, you will publicly attack your government twice in one decade. And, this time round, you'll also throw in your employer &#8212; one of the world's most renowned universities &#8212; accusing it of covering up a scientific fraud.<P></P>
The fraud in question is the viability of the Pentagon's much-vaunted missile-defense system, aimed at defending the continent against long-range ballistic missile attack by rogue nations or terrorist groups. 
<P></P>(Ottawa has yet to formally decide if it will participate in the system. Washington will proceed regardless.)<P></P>Tens of billions of dollars have been spent developing ground-based, sensor-equipped rockets &#8212; "kill vehicles" that would intercept and destroy incoming warheads &#8212; the first of which is to be installed in the fall of 2004.<P></P>There's just one problem, according to Postol, a 57-year-old missile systems specialist at Boston's Massachusetts Institute of Technology: They do not, cannot and will not work.<P></P>The system is fatally flawed, he says, because the sensors are incapable of distinguishing between a missile and a decoy &#8212; and decoys would be part of any enemy attack.<P></P>Postol charges that the findings were manipulated by the contractor, TRW Inc. <P></P>Moreover, when MIT's prestigious Lincoln Laboratory was asked to review TRW's research, rather than risk millions a year in government funding, it rubber-stamped the work.<P></P>Or, as the blunt-speaking physicist prefers to put it: "They lied and concealed evidence. They covered up a scientific fraud. They may be in criminal violation."<P></P>Postol will tell this to anyone who asks. He's determined to first embarrass MIT into retracting its approval and then return to his campaign to halt &#8212; not fix because it's "unfixable" &#8212; a defense system he's convinced will end in as a monumentally costly failure.
<P></P>"What else can I do?" he says from Boston. "I'm a witness to a crime. Do I just walk away?"<P></P>He didn't the last time.<P></P>Shortly after the 1991 Gulf War, Postol notoriously attacked the Pentagon's claims of dazzling success with its new Patriot missiles. <P></P>Sifting through hours of videotape, he produced evidence showing that the Patriots had failed to intercept almost all the Scud missiles fired by Iraq.<P></P>The Pentagon was furious, launching an investigation into whether Postol had committed security violations and slapping a classified rating on the article in <i>International Security</i>, the journal in which he made his case.<P></P>
It took the better part of a decade and considerable denigration before Postol was vindicated and the defense department officially conceded he'd been right. The Patriot <i>had</i> been a disappointing failure (which would be corrected in time for Gulf War II).<P></P>
Postol was incensed then, and is now, that his patriotism is so often questioned. He is not opposed in principle to missile defense, he says. "I just think if you're going to have these things, they should work."<P></P>
For the last four years, he's been hot on the trail of the defense shield, and even his critics don't deny he brings as much credibility as bravado to the task. 
<P></P>In the early 1980s, Postol worked at the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, analyzing, among other things, the MX nuclear missile. <P></P>He was then senior scientific adviser to the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon before returning to academia, first at Stanford University, then at his alma mater, MIT.<P></P>
He knows the military establishment, he says, and it isn't the generals who are pushing for the current defense system. 
<P></P>"The military thinks it's a bad idea because it takes money away from what they need to do right now," he explains. "The U.S. has a lot of defense commitments around the world."<P></P>Postol says it's the civilian leadership at the Pentagon and the inner circles of George W. Bush's White House who are to blame, a deadly mix of true believers and opportunists.<P></P>"Half of them are motivated by ideology and have no understanding of the technology. Those who do understand it know it's nonsense, but they want to advance themselves. Their attitude is, `I'm not going to be on watch when it fails.'"<P></P>In a typically brash reference to Adolf Hitler's architect, he calls them "the Albert Speers of the administration." As for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, "his belief system is disconnected from the world as I know it."<P></P>It was Rumsfeld who repeatedly claimed that North Korea has the wherewithal to launch a nuclear attack on the United States, a statement that did much to assuage missile-system skeptics, though it was later knocked to the ground.<P></P>
Having nuclear material on hand and having the capacity to weaponize it, especially over intercontinental distances, are two very different things. Postol says the United States faces no imminent threat necessitating the rush to build a defense shield.
<P></P>But 10 silos, six of them in Alaska and four in California, are slated to be in the ground by next fall &#8212; just before the November election, he pointedly adds.<P></P>"Even if the technology did work, there isn't even time for it to be tested. They say, `We've got to get something in the ground, then we can see if it works.' That's just wasting vast resources."<P></P>
Postol was alerted to defects in the missile technology by Nira Schwartz, a computer scientist at TRW who was fired after trying to get the company to admit the problem to the defense department.
<P></P>She attempted to sue TRW under the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to blow the whistle on companies that are defrauding the government. She failed, but the U.S. Justice Department twice set up two outside investigations into her charges (both biased, in Postol's view).<P></P>When Postol saw Schwartz's evidence, he concluded the flaw was even worse than she'd thought. A kill vehicle's sensor could hit isolated objects, but it could make no distinction if more than one kind of object was coming in. <P></P>Warheads produce no "signature" of heat, radiation or movement that would ever uniquely identify them &#8212; a decoy balloon would look exactly the same to the sensor.<P></P>In 2000, Postol wrote a letter to then-president Bill Clinton's chief of staff outlining the defects and cover-up and recommending an independent team of scientists review the data and be allowed to monitor future testing. He forwarded a copy to the New York Times. <P></P>The Pentagon responded as it had done before &#8212; promptly classifying the letter.<P></P>Whistleblower Part II was in play.<P></P>In the months following, MIT agreed to re-examine the original TRW report, but an FBI investigation concluded Postol's charges were merely a "scientific dispute" and his "attempts to raise it to the level of criminal conduct had no basis in fact." <P></P>Congress set up a series of hearings in which the Pentagon and TRW stood by the technology, saying it had been improved and Postol was out of date.
<P></P>It's an insane claim, Postol says.<P></P>"It doesn't matter if they improve the technology, it is not a `solvable' problem. It's like realizing 30 stories up that the high rise you're building doesn't have solid foundations in the ground. But you keep building up, thinking it will correct itself. It won't."<P></P>Postol is the only one still talking publicly about the issue. <P></P>The Pentagon says: "We are done with this." <P></P>MIT refers inquirers to a statement released in January saying: "The bedrock principle for all research done at MIT is scientific integrity. Any allegation that there has been any deviation from that principle must be taken seriously, and that is what MIT has done in this case."<P></P>Postol doesn't see how that could be done without him knowing about it &#8212; and he doesn't.<P></P>He has dispatched accusatory letters to MIT's president, Charles Vest, and its governing board of directors but has received no reply. Board member Michael Koerner, president of Canada Overseas Investments Ltd. in Toronto, won't comment on the situation because "there is potential litigation." <P></P>Though he has tenure, Postol is convinced MIT wants him out and will accuse him of breaking confidentiality rules to do so.<P></P> Harassment has already begun, he claims, with the administration transferring research funds out of accounts earmarked for his use.<P></P>Robert Birgeneau, president of the University of Toronto and former dean of science at MIT, doubts that. He knows Postol's department head and says "he would defend Postol to the hilt."<P></P>In fact, Birgeneau knows all the players on the MIT side of the contretemps, describing Postol as "a sophisticated scientist, worth taking seriously. This isn't a question of, `There's that crackpot Postol.'"<P></P>On the other hand, "Charles Vest is a straight-shooter. He wouldn't take part in a cover-up."<P></P>Postol, meanwhile, doesn't think MIT has a leg to stand on and now has lawyers advising him. His confidence in what he is doing remains unshaken.<P></P>"What can any of them do?" he asks. "I was right the last time, and I am right today."</p>
