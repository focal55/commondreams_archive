<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, one of the most 
important and successful civil rights laws in U.S. history, may soon be 
undermined by the Bush Administration's Commission on Opportunity in 
Athletics.
<p>Title IX bars sex discrimination in any educational program or 
activity that receives federal funding, including athletics. The law 
gave women access to classes, facilities and opportunities that had 
historically been male-only.
<p>While not at risk of being repealed, it is widely believed that the 
Bush Administration established the Commission on Opportunity in 
Athletics as a vehicle to push a pre-determined agenda to weaken Title 
IX. The commission is to submit a written report to the U.S. Secretary 
of Education Rod Page by February 28, 2003.
<p>Prior to Title IX, if a woman wanted to pursue a professional degree
in college, she could be passed over for a law school or medical school 
program simply because she was a woman. Since then, the 30-year-old law 
has proven itself integral to women's rights. From the class rooms and 
playing fields to the executive suites, Title IX has been a vital tool 
in advancing equal opportunities for women and girls.
<p>It is the college playing field where Title IX is now being 
threatened. Some athletic directors and commentators mistakenly blame 
the law for the elimination of some minor men's sports. To give women 
the same athletic opportunities as men, say Title IX critics, schools 
are forced to remove men's opportunities because of a lack of money to 
support added teams. They claim that Title IX's equality standard 
(commonly referred to as "proportionality"), which requires colleges to 
demonstrate roughly the sameratio for male and female athletes as for 
students enrolled at the school, results in discrimination against male 
athletes.
<p>Contrary to the rationale of those who would like to weaken Title 
IX's equality standard, men's sports participation and funding have 
continued to grow.
<p>The real expenses starving minor men's sports of funding are the 
disproportionate share of university athletic dollars spent on one or 
two teams - football and men's basketball - and not spent to add new teams 
for women or to support other men's sports. Title IX should not be the 
scapegoat for irresponsible, nonprofit institutions of higher education 
that operate their football and men's basketball programs like 
professional franchises.
<p>Attention should turn to college presidents and athletic directors 
who fuel the growing arms races in football and men's basketball with 
million dollar coaches and excessive expenditures. The fact that these 
sports may bring in revenue (though some actually lose money) does not 
justify their bloated budgets, which take funds away from other men's 
sports as well as women's sports. Rather than sharing a little of what 
the football and men's basketball programs spend, the remaining men's 
and women's sports are forced to fight for the scraps, pitting the 
deprived against the deprived.
<p>Despite the gains women have made under Title IX, resources for 
women's sports have never caught up to resources for men's sports at 
most colleges and universities. Women's athletic programs continue to 
lag behind men's programs by every measurable criterion, including 
participation opportunities, athletic scholarships, operating budgets 
and recruiting expenditures.
<p>While 55 percent of our college populations are female, female 
athletes still receive only 42 percent of all college athletic 
participation opportunities,36 percent of sports operating expenditures,
32 percent of athlete recruitment spending, and 42 percent of athletic 
scholarship money amounting to $133 million less than male athletes 
receive in scholarships each year.
<p>Why are women still second-class citizens in athletics despite a law
guaranteeing that we treat our daughters as well as our sons? Because 
Title IX has never been adequately enforced. In fact, the federal agency
responsible for enforcing the law, the U.S. Department of Education's 
Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has never initiated a single proceeding 
to remove federal funds at any school or college that fails to comply. 
Instead, OCR has served as a negotiator of settlements that are usually 
less than what Title IX requires.
<p>In order to obtain the legal rights for gender equity in athletics 
guaranteed them under Title IX, women across the country have 
successfully filed civil rights complaints and lawsuits against 
institutions. But until women have the same opportunities as men to 
enjoy the psychological, physiological and sociological benefits that 
sports participation can provide, we must all insist on the preservation
and strengthened enforcement of Title IX.
