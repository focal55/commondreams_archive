<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well here we all are again, some of us
together for the first time but many of us now getting to know each
other rather well. This has been a special time in the history of our
nation. Through our anger and our pain we have also found great joy.
It is the joy of making our lives mean something--it is the joy of
connecting with deep values and worthy dreams. </p>
<p>And in the past few months I have come to
understand that human values and truth are winning, as they sometimes
do. They are lighting up the dark and challenging the politics of
fear and lies with the politics of love and truth. </p>
<p>We don't know how many times we will be
able to meet together--life is short--so we should savor these
moments. We should take a moment to recognize what has been done by a
small group of these friends here present and so many others around
our nation.</p>
<p>One of my favorite moments in this hard
time was when, in a District of Columbia courtroom, as I stood
accused of reading the Declaration of Independence aloud in the
Capitol Rotunda, and for which I and many of my friends had been
arrested and jailed--we were there to push for campaign finance
reform and to ask Congress to declare its independence from special
interest money--the judge passed judgment on us. He could have kept
us in jail for some time, of course. What dear old Judge Hamilton
said was exactly this--it is from the court record: "As you know, the
strength of our great country lies in its Constitution and her laws
and in her courts. But more fundamentally, the strength of our great
country lies in the resolve of her citizens to stand up for what is
right when the masses are silent. And, unfortunately, sometimes it
becomes the lot of the few, sometimes like yourselves, to stand up
for what's right when the masses are silent."</p>
<p>Well, he wasn't just speaking to me and to
my friends in that room. He was speaking to you--you brave souls who
dared be Americans when that meant speaking out for the soul of your
nation, against a torrent tide of madness. It became the lot of the
few to speak out even when the greatest newspapers and news
broadcasters were silent, and when our very Congress was spineless
and complicit. You stood in small groups on street corners with
signs. You wrote letters and you protested and you emailed, emailed,
emailed and shared what you could find out. You suffered name calling
and abuse and many of you went to jail. Our founding fathers led a
revolution with bravery, but they were a strong brotherhood of great
men acting together, and sometimes it was just you, and just him, and
just her, and I want to say how proud I am of all of you, for the
tide has turned and you have turned it. </p>
<p>And sure, we have a long way to go, and the
suffering is only beginning, and the forces of fear are still in
their ascendancy, though we now see their mortal arc. We know now
that a sleeping nation has awakened and our dear neighbors and our
Congressmen and newsmen and who were so long asleep or so bent under
their anchor desks in fear have begun to remember who they are and
what there jobs are. </p>
<p>And who was it who held the torch while
they were away but you, and you, and you--ye band of sisters and
brothers?</p>
<p>Can we see forward to a time when the
American government represents, all over the world, the best and
happiest instincts of the American people? Can we see a time when we,
each of us, can live in responsible balance with nature and all other
people? Can we evolve to our better selves as a nation, whose people
are at the reins of our own government and whose harsh past, harsh
from its very beginning, can move into the light? What better thing
have we got to do?</p>
<p>Indeed, we have waited for the last minute,
for the glaciers of our beautiful old planet are melting and the
people we have injured and oppressed are no longer impossibly far
away. We have come to a century of come-uppance, and we can, I
believe in my heart, come up to it. We have no choice, nor would we
want any other choice but to do our honorable best in the broad world
and here at home.</p>
<p>And now we have our election
coming.</p>
<p>Well, we all have jobs to do in the next
months. Many of you will work for candidates. I think you must do
that, and spare the fighting among yourselves in favor of moving the
message out to those who have given up on voting. We need those
votes, friends, and they do not come toward negative
campaigning.</p>
<p>For myself, I intend to do one thing in
this election. </p>
<p>Let me tell you that, for many long years,
I worked in a shoe factory here in Manchester. I know what it means
to be a working woman. It is hard in this culture, for there are many
demands placed upon you. There is little time for anything but for
life's essentials.</p>
<p>In this election, voting has become one of
life's essentials.</p>
<p>I want to help as many working women as
possible by bringing them what they need to register to vote and to
see that they have the time off to vote, the rides to the polls or
the reminders they need to do this important thing for themselves,
their retirement, their families, and for their America and its
freedoms and its justice.</p>
<p>I love my little house in the woods of New
Hampshire. I am comfortable there, next to a bright stream. But I
will be happy to run an errand, and I will do it very soon. I will
travel to work sites where women work to bring them what they need to
vote. I will walk through many towns to do this, finding as many
workplaces as I can, and I am going to buy a little red wagon for my
voter supplies. I will be happy to be driven between towns so that I
can cover the ground more quickly than when I walked the nation. My
friends have helped me map it out. We will cover 36 states and, with
the help of my friends, we will visit 100,000 workplaces. There is
only one thing that could possibly keep me from getting back home in
time to vote, and either way I shall be happy.</p>
<p>I do expect to be around for several more
elections, but you never know. If this is my last wish tour, then my
last wish is that America's women, who worked so hard amid great
violence for the right to vote, take that now as a sacred duty in
2004. It is not particularly easy to travel at my age, but I hope
they will take my little sacrifice as a nudge to inconvenience
themselves and vote.</p>
<p>I will need your help. Go to <a href="http://www.grannyd.com" target="_new">GrannyD.com</a>and volunteer to help me along the way. And if there is something I
can do along the way to help you in your own mission, just
ask.</p>
<p>Our friends and neighbors are full of
common sense, and that is what a democracy requires. If they have
good information from awakened news people and from candidates who
will please, God, spare us the platitudes and spend their millions on
useful information so that a great nation might make an informed
choice, then we have good reason to let our hearts fill with hope. We
must all talk-up the election. We must all share information with our
neighbors. We must speak in calm tones and respect the dignity of our
opponents even when it is clear they are scoundrels, for the tone of
our society is a part of the substance of our society. </p>
<p>We must encourage our free press as it
sputters back to life. Not only must we demand and encourage good
reporting, but we must take the best stories and copy them out and
share them with our friends and neighbors--to double their effect.
And we must encourage the news networks to get back in the business
of exit polling during the election. Many of us are worried about the
honesty of our elections. The networks pulled away from exit polling
because they thought--or they say they thought--that they got it
wrong in Florida. In fact they got it right. They do get it right and
they are our best safeguard now for an honest election. Demand exit
polling. Create petitions to insist on it, and to pledge to only
watch coverage by networks who will provide it. And I hope good
watchdog organizations will be on hand to make records of those who
are turned away from voting.</p>
<p>And for ourselves more personally, we must
vote and take our neighbors to vote and call from lists that we must
make to see that this is a turnout like no other. And then our
democracy will be safe enough to begin its larger awakening, and God
help us to see that day, for the world and all nature awaits that
joy.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say that my hope is that we
all vote so that our leaders will be expression of our highest civic
values. You know, it is interesting that the United Nations
headquarters is in our country. It is interesting because the United
States is in a real sense a union of nations. Look around your
community and you will see your fellow Americans who are Iraqis and
Palestinians and Jews and Russians and French and Irish and Africans
and South Americans and Europeans and Catholics and Mormons and
Buddhists and Sikhs and Moslems and Baptists and Asians and Pacific
Islanders and all the rest. This nation is a union of the world's
people and, my, that is a grand thing to celebrate. Our president and
our other leaders must be worthy of that America, and they must be
men and women of peace and creativity and joy. Only with such
leadership, where all our children are raised together with the best
we can give them, where our adventures into the broad world are
unselfish and full of light, can America prosper and survive this
amazing time. What work we have to do, and how we do love
it!</p>
