<p>One of my cherished childhood memories is of my petite, polite mother
closing the front door firmly on two hulking FBI agents who wanted to
come in and ask her questions. "I don't have to talk to you," she
informed them in a steely voice, and she didn't. Wow, Mom! I can't swear
to all the details--were the agents really so big, or was I just little?
and did they really wear hats and trench coats, or have I dressed them
to fit the 1950s stereotype?--but I do have a distinct memory of them
casually lifting the lids from our streetside garbage cans as they left
and peering inside, like cooks checking the stockpot. I doubt they
really expected to find secret papers tossed in with the banana peels
and steak bones; they were simply making a point. After my mother died,
I sent away for her FBI file, which revealed, among other more serious
invasions of privacy, that every year the FBI would phone our house on a
pretext to make sure we still lived there. Honestly, hadn't they noticed
that the phone book has addresses too? Your government dollars at work.

</p>
<p>

But why wallow in ancient history? In the wake of September 11, spying
on citizens is back in all its careless glory. Indeed, it appears it
never really went away. For example, my old friend Barbara Levy Cohen
and her husband, Mark Cohen, are among the many represented by an ACLU
lawsuit against the Denver Police Department. The Colorado branch of the
ACLU announced last March that it had learned that the DPD had conducted
surveillance and maintained "criminal intelligence files" since the
1950s (!) on people engaged in constitutionally protected political
activities. Soon after, Mayor Wellington Webb admitted that "the issues
that have been raised by the ACLU as well as others are legitimate" and
that files existed on 3,200 individuals and 208 organizations, from the
Million Mom March to the "criminal extremist" American Friends Service
Committee, the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center and NARAL.
</p>
<p>

As always seems to be the case with police files, the Denver dossiers
are full of egregious misinformation and dark comedy. Barbara, a
serious, mild-mannered secretary who, when not organizing around Native
American and fair-trade issues, likes to read and go to the movies, is
identified as having a "direct relationship" with an "outlaw biker" gang
involved with "narcotics, weapons." (Not true, Barbara says, for the
record.) Mark's file contains a group photograph with an arrow pointing
to him--only it's not him. Margaret Taniwaki, a Japanese-American woman
who spent time as a child in a World War II internment camp in
California, is identified as "Caucasian" (maybe they meant to write
"Asian"?); her ex-husband of twenty years has a file because she drove a
car registered in his name. Sister Antonia Anthony, a 74-year-old nun
who belonged to a pro-Zapatista organization called the Chiapas
Coalition, was cited as supporting the overthrow of the Mexican
government--which would make her more of a firebrand than the Zapatistas
themselves.
</p>
<p>

But there are more serious items, too. Glenn Morris, chair of the
political science department at the University of Colorado, Denver, and
member of the leadership council of the Colorado American Indian
Movement (AIM), had a death threat listed in his files: The police knew
about it but never passed it on. While Cassandra Medrano and Pavlos
Stavropoulos were in Greece, another couple used their car to drive to
an antiglobalization demonstration; that couple's 9-year-old
child--listed as a "reliable" source in the files--gave a police officer
information about her parents that the DPD misassigned to Medrano and
Stavropoulos; using this "information," the DPD started a file on
Medrano and added to its file on Stavropoulos. Do we want to live in a
society where fourth-graders are considered reliable sources, and in
which cops probe children for information about their parents on the
basis of political beliefs and activities that are legal?
</p>
<p>

What causes do "criminal extremists" favor in Denver? Besides
reproductive rights, good works and pacifism, apparently they are keen
on Native American rights: "Of the files I've seen," Barbara tells me,
"three-quarters mention AIM and protests against Columbus Day, which is
a big issue here in Denver." The Direct Action Network, an
antiglobalization/fair trade group, also caught the inquisitorial eye:
So much so that at one point the DPD, aware that its usual infiltrators
had become familiar faces, asked a detective from the vice and drugs
control bureau to attend a DAN meeting undercover. Given such practices,
it's not surprising that another popular cause is protesting abuses of
the citizenry by the Denver Police Department. Barbara's and Mark's
files note that in 1991 they co-signed a letter published in the
<i>Colorado Statesman</i>, a local weekly, criticizing the police for
racism. Why does this classic exercise of the First Amendment belong in
secret dossiers?
</p>
<p>

Not that spying on the nonviolent would ever be right, but it's worth
noting that the Denver debacle was facilitated by the police's lack of
training in the use of the Orion Scientific Systems software program:
Crucial decisions about how to categorize and input information (what
constituted "criminal extremism," for example) were made in an
unprofessional, whimsical way. Other cities in which secret police files
have been uncovered tell a similar story of inept paranoia: Until the
mid-1980s, four years after passage of a state law barring police spying
on nonviolent political activities, Portland police kept tabs on a wide
variety of groups, including the Northwest Oregon Voter Registration
Project, a food co-op, a bicycle repair collective, a group setting up a
rape hotline and a battered women's shelter.
</p>
<p>

These days, local authorities are eager to jettison longstanding
restraints imposed after abuses in the 1970s and go back to their
old-fashioned ways. The New York City Police Department, for example,
announced that it wants to be able to spy on citizens without having to
persuade an official three-member panel that it has just cause--even
though it cited no examples of this process hindering an investigation.
In a fine twist, the NYPD plans to use an updated version of the Orion
software employed to such notable effect by the Denver PD.
