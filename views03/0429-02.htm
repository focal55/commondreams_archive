<p>WASHINGTON -- What if the North took over the South and didn't find any slaves? The Civil War could have been justified by other arguments, some of which seemed more compelling at the time: The South's defiance of past agreements; its attempt to impose its will on neighboring territories; the economic cost of depriving northern mills of a reliable source of cotton. But everyone knew the underlying tension was related to slavery, and any attempt to deny it would have distorted the meaning of the war. As Ulysses S. Grant concluded after 584 pages of his famous memoirs, ''the cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United States will have to be attributed to slavery.'' Obviously, the South made no effort to hide the existence of slavery the way Saddam Hussein denied the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But the US buildup to the Iraq war was based on the virtual certainty that such weapons existed and, by their very presence, presented an irresolvable conflict. 

 

<p>Last week in Washington, while the search for weapons of mass destruction proceeded with archeological slowness, the Bush administration trumpeted other justifications for the war, such as Hussein's brutality, while quietly expressing confidence that banned weapons will be discovered or found to have been destroyed. Democrats, even some who supported the war, began rumbling about how a failure to find any weapons of mass destruction would damage President Bush's credibility, as if his standing were the only thing at risk.

<p>This is political spin, aimed at a presidential election that's already underway. But this dialogue, as much as the chance that inspectors won't find any weapons, threatens to undermine what has been the most consistent message of the war, that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction must end and that nations who fail to cooperate will face dire consequences.

<p>Were Bush to back away from that argument to save political face -- blurring the message of the war with talk of striking blows for freedom and toppling tyrants -- the world would reasonably think that Iraq was targeted because it offended American ideals. Those ideals are not shared by most regimes in the Middle East and many in Asia and Africa.

<p>Those regimes could reasonably take a different message from the war, that the United States will strike out against them even if they don't have a nuclear program or freezers full of chemicals and viruses. Furthermore, they are likely to decide, as North Korea and Iran seem to have concluded, that the best way to defeat US aggression is to gin up just those weapons programs Washington wants to ban. And a war that began as a demonstration of resolve against weapons of mass destruction could end up fueling a race to secure those very weapons.

<p>Last week, North Korea interrupted its joint talks with China and the United States to advertise its own nuclear arsenal and threaten to go into the business of selling bombs. It also reportedly declared it was reprocessing fuel rods, a significant escalation of its nuclear program. North Korea has habitually tossed down the nuclear card to trump any outside efforts to penetrate its anachronistic, Communist society, but it has worked itself into a paranoid frenzy since Bush labeled it part of the ''axis of evil.''

<p>The Iraq war should send North Korea an important message about the necessity of giving up its nuclear ambitions. But that message won't register if the North Koreans believe that the United States is coming after them anyway.

<p>Bush, his advisers say, studied Lincoln to glean lessons of a wartime presidency. Donald H. Rumsfeld reportedly recommended that Bush read the work of Eliot Cohen, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, who praised Lincoln's willingness to overrule his generals. Last year the president was seen carrying a copy of Jay Winik's book on the last days of the Civil War, ''April 1865.''

<p>If he's kept up his reading, Bush probably realizes that the greatest contribution of a wartime president, other than winning a war, is establishing its meaning. Lincoln remolded a war that began for a confusion of reasons into an enduring statement about freedom and civil rights, a reference point for centuries of struggle.

<p>Clearly Bush wants the Iraq war to make the world safer by sending a message about weapons of mass destruction. Failure to find evidence of those weapons could erode the ability of the United States to deter terrorism. Happily, most in Washington still believe that some evidence will come to light. But this is one test that Bush shouldn't try to pass by lowering expectations.
