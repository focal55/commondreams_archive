<p>On my radio show back in October of 2002, I had renowned conservative author Ann Coulter appear as a guest.  Already giddy because of her successful release of Slander, Coulter spoke condescendingly to me after I asked her if the drumbeats of war with Iraq by the Republican Party was right to do during the campaign season.

 

<p>Here’s how Coulter responded:

 
<p> <i>No, I love this Democratic idea that issues that don’t reflect well on the Democrats are unfair to use as a campaign issues--like it would be outrageous for Americans to know where a politician stands on a rather important issue of war.  Yeah, I think it should be an issue.
</i>
 

<p>The final moments transpired as follows:

 

<p>Pat Johnston:<i> Who’s worse: Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein, because we don’t hear much about Osama bin Laden any more.

 

</i>
<p>Coulter:<i> Right, that’s because he’s dead!</i> (Laughter)

 

<p>Johnston:  <i>You think he’s dead?


 

</i>
<p>Coulter: (Inaudible) <i>He’s less than a threat to America.</i> (Laughter)

 

<p>Johnston: <i>Okay, if he’s dead, all right.  Well I didn’t know he’s dead.  I haven’t heard Condoleezza Rice or anybody out there say he’s dead yet, so . . .

 

</i>
<p>Coulter:  <i>Don’t worry, I’m telling you.</i>

 

<p>Well, I think it is suffice to say this wouldn’t be the first time Coulter’s (and other neo-cons) presumptions proved to be disastrously wrong.  Yet she and her friends were the ones driving the American discourse as the war drums were beating. 

 

<p>Many didn’t share the dangerous views Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, or even former liberal funnyman Dennis Miller had about Iraq and why it had to be destroyed.  Nor did many believe everything would be rosy in Iraq once the Americans ousted Saddam from Iraq.  But those voices were crushed under the guise of “patriotism.”

 

<p>We were told we have to get Saddam before he gets us!  Remember 9/11!  We have to stop Saddam from blowing us up, just like they did on 9/11!

 

<p>Then, the French became our tackling dummies for actually questioning America’s motives behind Bush’s political war.  Frankly, every dissenter became a tackling dummy for the right and the President whenever they wrapped themselves up with the flag.

 

<p>And the unforgivable lack of media oversight was one of the two main reasons this war was allowed to go forth.  The media were too busy cozying up to the administration and the government, so they could send their correspondents on tanks with our soldiers.

 

<p>After all, the networks were after ratings, not truth.

 

<p>Perhaps the television and print mediums were afraid to appear “Un-American.”  The jingoism from the neo-conservative press and the Republican Party frightened the mainstream press to actually ask important questions.  For example,  “What will we do once we oust Saddam?”

 

<p>After all, newspapers and television networks are rewarded by advertising.

 

<p>Remember what happened to Bill Maher when he said the first politically incorrect statement on Politically Incorrect after 9-11?    Advertisers fled, and ABC flung Maher.

 

<p>A Detroit Free Press story on August 27, 2002, titled “Cheney talks up Iraq: Poll finds Americans support military strike,” described how “a solid 67 percent favor taking the war on terrorism to Iraq, according to a new Knight Ridder poll conducted by Princeton Survey Research.”  What’s more is that the American people believed Iraq was the next step in the war on terrorism.  According to the article, the president of Princeton Survey Research said, “The American people felt gravely wounded by 9/11, and the urge to take steps to prevent something like that from ever happening again is extremely strong.  People think of things through that Prism.  9/11 is the context of all discussion of Iraq.”

 

<p>You have to hand it to the Bush administration for a job well done.  Disinformation was the incredible weapon to rally the populace around your goal for regime change.  Not only that, but fear is another weapon to sway the public.

 

<p>Vice President Dick Chaney told a group of veterans in August of 2002, that Hussein was preparing to use weapons of mass destruction against the United States.  The same Free Press story quoted Chaney criticizing dissenters of the war of “wishful thinking or willful blindness.”

 

<p>Because the President and his neo-con buddies were successful in blurring the 9/11-Iraq line, almost 70 percent of American in a Washington Post poll taken around the two year anniversary of 9/11 believed Iraq did play a role in the 9/11 attacks.

 

<p>The press did not pursue that rather significant question: If Iraq didn’t have anything to do with 9/11, why are we attacking that country and not Saudi Arabia?

 

<p>The answer to that question was quite obvious.  If you remember back in August of 2002, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah had lunch at Bush’s Texas ranch.  Bush, as The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd pointed out, sadly fawned “over the Saudis.”  She also lamented that the Saudis “have never formally apologized to America for the 15 Saudi citizens who came here and killed 3,000 Americans as they went to work on sun-dappled September morning.”  

 

<p>Saddam at least allowed the U.N. inspectors back in Iraq to search for weapons, only to find none.

 

<p>We have been in Iraq for over seven months trying to find the “smoking gun,” only to find nothing.

 

<p>A few members of the press are accepting some of the blame.  Finally.

 

<p>CNN’s top war correspondent, Christian Amanpour, told CNBC last week, "I think the press was muzzled and I think the press self-muzzled.”  She admitted the press did not fulfill its job by refusing to ask tough questions about weapons of mass destruction.  She said, "It looks like this was disinformation at the highest levels."

 

<p>A Fox News spokesperson responded to Amanpour’s charge, saying, "Given the choice, it's better to be viewed as a foot soldier for Bush than a spokeswoman for Al-Qaeda,"

 

<p>You can understand why Fox News is praised for its objectivity.

 

<p>Thomas Jefferson said of the press, that, “Our liberty depends upon freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.”  Because of this administration’s control of the press, it was lost.  If you disagree, I refer you back to the President’s quasi-press conference just before the war began. 


 

<p>The Democratic Party, too, failed at its job as being the dissenting party.  With the exception of a few—Senator Ted Kennedy and Rep. Dennis Kucinich to name a couple—the party panicked during the 2002 elections.  They tried to sound like Bush, and ultimately failed.  The party didn’t even come to the aid of Vietnam veteran Max Cleland after he was grossly juxtaposed in a political advertisement as a friend of Hussein and bin Laden’s.  They feared the public, but even worse, they feared the Bush machine.

 

<p>Many of the Democrats voted to authorize Bush the power to invade Iraq.  Presidential hopeful John Kerry is still trying to explain that vote.  They quibbled a little before the war began, and once again hibernated once the first bombs were dropped.

 

<p>But one man decided to take him on, and argue that the plan in Iraq was flawed from the start.  That man was little-known Democratic Presidential candidate Howard Dean, a former governor of Vermont.  He quickly understood that there were many Americans outraged by the complicity of the Democratic Party and of the American Press.  After all, Prime Minister Tony Blair was not receiving the hero’s welcome back in Great Britain.

 

<p>He attacked Bush and the neo-cons, and refused to back down to their hateful rhetoric.  The press could no longer ignore Dean as his popularity and numbers grew.  And slowly, Bush’s numbers fell, and fell some more.  Americans began to wonder if we should ask for some outside help.  Because if there’s one thing Americans don’t like to hear, is that they are going to be the ones to pay for everything in the end.

 

<p>The President asked Congress and the American people to accept the bill for $87 billion.  Not only that, consider the billions we have already spent.  Recall that we bribed—er—offered Turkey billions to help America in its cause.  Believe it or not, the money is still being shelled-out to Turkey.

 

<p>As Thomas Oliphant noted in The Boston Globe this week, Bush signed-off another $8.5 billion in loans and “other goodies” to Turkey over the weekend, in order to get Turkey into Iraq.  Oliphant insightfully illustrates why Senator Kennedy wasn’t hitting one out of bounds when he criticized the way this administration uses money to gain a coalition.

 

<p>The lack of questioning by the American media, and by the opposition party has led to this quagmire.  Not in Iraq, but rather the quagmire of the United States budget.  For a party, or for a group of people who loathe government spending, the Republicans have no reservations about throwing money at a problem; a problem in which $87 billion won’t be the final number when all is said and done.

 

<p>But Bush, and the many members of Congress will be long gone, once the American people start paying off this war and the debt.  It must be nice not to be held accountable for poor planning, and poor advice.

 

<p>Thanks to the Ann Coulter’s of the world, the American people have to pay for the neo-cons mistakes.  Well, at least it’s not their kids who have to die in Iraq.
