<p>The stench of hypocrisy, that cheap perfume, has been permeating the air lately.
<p>First, Bill Bennett's gambling habit was outed, to mild censure. His defenders have a point. Who cares if a desperately addicted rich guy loses $8 million over a 10-year period to one-armed bandits, as long as the wife and kids aren't starving, etc.? It was his money. The vice is legal. What's the harm?
<p>You'd have to be pretty partisan to point out that Bennett, along with such famous philanderers as Newt Gingrich and Henry Hyde, tried with vicious single-mindedness to bring down Bill Clinton over the matter of a little adultery.

<p>All addicts deserve understanding. Anyway, Bennett's gambling days are over. Good luck on that!

<p>But still, you know, the compassion catches. A besmirched moralist asks for the sort of forbearance that he wouldn't have given some another poor sinner in a million years. His political currency was rectitude; he clubbed Clinton with it, then all the rest of us. All the while, wow, the moralist was running up $200,000 tabs in Vegas. How come no one heard his cry for help?

<p>About the same time that Bennett's filthy-lucre-stained laundry was wafting, ghosts of the hypocrisy-enflamed hysteria known as the Red Scare were coming back to haunt us.

<p>SEEING RED

<p>The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs released the transcripts of Joe McCarthy's closed-door hearings of suspected subversives 50 years ago. They showed -- no big surprise -- that he browbeat his witnesses. But what a weasel. He also used the secret hearings to cull out the more fearless and articulate of his ''suspects.'' Those who stood their ground weren't called on to testify later in public.

<p>The grinding sham of this! McCarthy manipulated not only the machinery of democracy but also the fears and values -- the sacred cows -- of his constituent public. He gave us spectacle in the guise of truth-seeking. Like many of the high-profile bigots of the same era (e.g., Orville Faubus), McCarthy didn't believe in his cause so much as play, for personal gain, to a public that believed in it passionately.

<p>But the most asphyxiating odor of hypocrisy is the freshest. This isn't about 50 years ago or 10 years ago, but today.

<p>The game of power never changes, I suppose. Like Casablanca's Claude Rains, many of us were ''shocked, shocked'' to hear that a Dick Cheney's old company, Halliburton, will now be pumping oil in Iraq -- 125,000 barrels a day, and maybe 400,000 a day by summer -- in a no-bid contract with the Army Corps of Engineers that has a, gasp, $7 billion cap.

<p>The same day that reporters and Democrats wrested loose the gory details of Halliburton's contract -- no, they're not just putting out oil fires; they're taking over the whole operation -- came news of Iraqis' digging something else out of the ground: the bones of Saddam Hussein's political opponents. They dug with their bare hands.

<p>As many as 200,000 people disappeared during the 24 years of that regime, according to Human Rights Watch. The numbers bloom with new horror as they turn into skulls and rib cages and clumps of hair -- human remains unearthed by the victims' relatives from mass graves beneath prison yards and soccer fields.

<p>You could say that the price the Iraqis paid for the privilege of digging up their dead was sovereignty and, in particular, control over the black gold beneath their sand.

<p>''American soldiers came here on the first day and promised to come back and help dig,'' a Shiite university student named Najji Hamed told a Chicago Tribune reporter during excavation of a mass grave in Hillah. ``They lied.''

<p>We've secured the oil fields with due dispatch and have begun making plans to privatize them, but we are callously fumbling any collaborative role with the people of Iraq in the grim and sacred task of identifying and reburying Hussein's political dead. Oil and profit come first.

<p>In Iraq, the rising scent is not merely that of human remains.
