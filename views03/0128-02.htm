<p>About a week ago, I was a guest on Michael Medved's nationally syndicated talk radio show. The topic was my last column.<p>
I had written about a group of business leaders and just plain rich folk (members of the top five percent of income earners and asset holders in the United States) who belong to this organization called Responsible Wealth.<p>
They have made a name for themselves speaking out in opposition to the Bush push for permanent repeal of the estate tax. In five simple words, their message is: Mend it; don't end it.
<p>
So, I'm on the program trying to explain the traditional American values behind the movement that Newsweek has called the "billionaire backlash." Medved isn't one to give guests like me much time to talk and so it was difficult to expose the many fallacies that surface when discussing the subject with people who think all taxes are nothing more than official theft.<p>
One sweet-sounding lady called to ask me a question. "I don't mean this in a combative way," she said, "but are you a Marxist?"<p>
I'll leave the State of the Union address to the president's brilliant speechwriters. But I can tell you that the state of public discourse is in a bad way right now.<p>
Marxism used to refer to Stalinist-command economies. Now you can be branded as a member of the international "evil empire" for suggesting that a tax going back to 1916 ought to be reformed and not repealed.<p>
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. After all, I've seen letters to the editor insulting the memory of Holocaust victims by comparing public smoking bans to Nazism. As CIA analysts take for granted, social instability is the inevitable result in societies where wealth is highly concentrated and economic inequality is great.<p>
Here's something I bet you won't hear much about tonight when No. 43 perches himself atop The Bully Pulpit: The top one percent of this great nation's economic pyramid own 38.1 percent of America's wealth, while the bottom 40 percent have a mere 0.2 percent.<p>
Over the past 20 years, the wealth gap in the United States has grown dramatically. This is partly due to the fact that the economic boom of the 1990s happened in a decade when most working people's real wages remained flat or failed to recoup the ground that had been lost since the 1970s. America now has the distinction of being the most economically unequal nation in the industrialized world, which is why some observers refer to our time as the second Gilded Age.<p>
During America's first Gilded Age, there were two inheritance tax ideas being promoted. One was that the hereditary transfer of concentrated wealth is incompatible with the ideal of equality of opportunity and democracy.<p>
The other idea was based on the realization that society plays a significant role in the creation of individual wealth and, therefore, has some claim on a portion of that wealth.<p>
And so in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed a federal inheritance tax, arguing that "the man of great wealth owes a particular obligation to the State because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government...<p>
"The primary objective of an (estate tax) should be to put a constantly increasing burden on the inheritance of those swollen fortunes which it is certainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate."<p>
According to the talk radio lexicon, that's a Marxist talking.<p>
Medved did acknowledge that the pro-repeal PR machine has made exaggerated claims about the "family farms and businesses" that have been impacted by the estate tax, but several other confusions persisted.<p>
Confusion: The estate tax is "double taxation." The researchers at United for a Fair Economy (www.FairEconomy.org) counter: "Money is taxed any number of times as it cycles through the economy, generally during transactions. Workers, for example, pay income, payroll, sales and property tax on their wages. What's more, the bulk of the largest estates, which consist of unrealized capital gains, would never have been taxed were it not for the estate tax."<p>
Confusion: The estate tax 'confiscates' over half the value of all estates. Clarity: "For 98 percent of Americans, the estate tax takes away nothing. For the other 2 percent, the average effective tax rate is 19 percent.<p>
Don't take my word for any of this. Check it out for yourself. With millions of children going hungry and without health insurance everyday in America, and with schools in desperate need of resources, you just might join the chorus of those singing: Mend it; don't end it.<p>
