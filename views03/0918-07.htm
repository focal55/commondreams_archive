<p>Last summer a survey by a reputable Washington organization -- the Pew Research Center For The People & The Press -- revealed that the solidarity the world felt for the United States after the attacks of 9/11 was vanishing. For the most part, 35,000 respondents in 27 countries still had a positive view of the United States, even in France and Germany (where approval was above 60 percent), but anti-Americanism was growing.

<p>This summer, good feelings appear to have vanished for good. The kind of rabid Anti-Americanism once heard of mostly in the Arab street is spreading worldwide. Last year South Korea and Russia were still in the favorable camp. Now, 46 percent of South Koreans and only 36 percent of Russians still view the United States favorably. Italy's favorable rating has fallen from 70 percent last summer to 60 percent. The rating is down to 45 percent in Germany and 43 percent in France (from 61 and 63 percent, respectively). The drop in Indonesia, supposedly an ally, was drastic: from 61 percent to 15 percent. It is even lower in Pakistan, one of the biggest beneficiaries of American aid since 2001.


<p>Feelings in Arab nations are expected to be violently anti-American; state-controlled media there peddle the prejudice like a sport. But that doesn't explain why good feelings have eroded severely in Britain, Canada and Brazil. This may: Overall, 75 percent of respondents say the world is more dangerous in 2003 than it was in 2002, and they blame American power -- not terrorism -- for fostering insecurity. The blame is to a large extent unfair and simplistic. American ambitions are broad and frequently heavy-handed. They provide an easy target for critics, especially those in Arab countries looking for scapegoats to their own failings. But they're not more dangerous than terrorism.

<p>Still, the question remains: Why is American power perceived as such a threat in the very nations the United States seeks to be protecting? President Bush's rash, go-it-alone strategy is one answer. "I will seize the opportunity to achieve big goals," he told an interviewer last year. "There is nothing bigger than to achieve world peace." But Bush has convinced himself that only the United States can achieve those ends. For good reason, the world is not convinced.

<p>The consequences have been two-fold. On one hand, there's been a new wave of the kind of popular America-bashing that has swept the globe from time to time ever since the United States became a superpower. In Britain, making fun of Americans in commercials is as common as French claims that Americans are unsophisticated. It's mostly harmless, and its flip side is on display in the United States when restaurants declare that they won't serve French wine anymore or the congressional kitchen renames its french fries "freedom fries."

<p>Far more harmful to American interests, however, is the way anti-Americanism bleeds into diplomatic and trade relations. For all the questionable reasons surrounding the Iraq invasion itself, the rebuilding of Iraq could be a unique experiment in birthing democracy where it never existed. Sustained world cooperation is vital. But American intransigence is in the way. Whether because U.S. control safeguards lucrative rebuilding contracts for friends of the Bush administration, or whether President Bush really believes that only Americans are qualified to build democracy, the strategy is foolish, immensely costly, and likely to fail. The resentment the strategy has fostered among allies is now echoed by resentment among Americans, a majority of whom oppose Bush's latest request of $87 billion to pay Iraq's ongoing bills.

<p>Trade relations are suffering as well. Facing a record $600 billion trade deficit this year and a continuing drain of manufacturing jobs, President Bush needs big trading partners such as China to compete fairly. On Sept. 2 Treasury Secretary John Snow went to China to talk tough about China's undervalued currency, which boosts Chinese exports while undermining job creation in the United States. He talked plenty but got nothing: American leverage, and unilateralism, only goes so far.

<p>For all the unfairness of much of the America-bashing, it is also a signal to President Bush that the world doesn't just want American leadership to feel secure, but American cooperation. So far, Bush persists in being only half right.
