<p>Did retired General Anthony Zinni really call George W. 
Bush's war in Iraq a "brain fart"? That seems to be the case. 
But first, some background.</p>
<p>
On Thursday night, Zinni, the former commander of the U.S. 
Central Command, was interviewed by Ted Koppel on <i> 
Nightline</i>. And he was rather sharp in his assessment of 
George W. Bush's policy in Iraq. Before the war, Zinni, who 
had been an envoy for Bush in the Middle East, opposed a 
U.S. invasion of Iraq, arguing that Saddam Hussein did not 
pose an imminent threat. On <i> Nightline</i>, Zinni 
compared Bush's push for the war with the Gulf of Tonkin 
incident--an infamous episode in which President Lyndon 
Johnson misrepresented an attack on two U.S. Navy 
destroyers in order to win congressional approval of the war 
in Vietnam--and he challenged "the credibility behind" Bush's 
prewar assertions concerning Iraq's possession of weapons 
of mass destruction and its association with anti-American 
terrorists. "I'm suggesting," Zinni said, "that either the 
[prewar] intelligence was so bad and flawed--and if that's the 
case, then somebody's head ought to roll for that--or the 
intelligence was exaggerated or twisted in a way to make a 
more convenient case to the American people." Zinni said he 
believed that Hussein had maintained "the framework for a 
weapons of mass destruction program that could be quickly 
activated once sanctions were lifted" and that such a 
program, while worrisome, did not immediately endanger the 
United States.</p>
<p>
Zinni raised the issue that Bush might have purposefully 
misled the public and not shared with it the true reason for 
the war: "If there's a strategic decision for taking down Iraq, if 
it's the so-called neoconservative idea that taking apart Iraq 
and creating a model democracy, or whatever it is, will 
change the equation in the Middle East, then make the 
[public] case based on that strategic decision....I think it's a 
flawed--like the domino theory--it's a flawed strategic thought 
or concept....But if that's the reason for going in, that's the 
case the American people ought to hear. They ought to make 
their judgment and determine their support based on what 
the motivation is for the attack."</p>
<p>
Zinni was, in a way, being polite. Earlier in the month, he 
addressed a forum sponsored by the U.S. Naval Institute and 
the Marine Corps Association. There he let loose. Reflecting 
the views of high-ranking U.S. military officials who were 
dubious about launching a war against Iraq and skeptical 
about the occupation that would follow, Zinni accused the 
Bush crowd of having not been ready for the challenges to 
come after defeating the Iraqi army. "We're in danger of 
failing," he noted, because the Bush administration had not 
readied itself for what would follow the initial military 
engagement. "We fought one idiot here [in Iraq], just now," he 
said. "Ohio State beat Slippery Rock 62 to 0. No shit! You 
know! But we weren't ready for that team that came onto the 
field at the end of that three-week victory." He went on:</p>
<p>
"Right now, in a place like Iraq, you're dealing with Jihadists 
that are coming in to raise hell, crime on the streets that's 
rampant, ex-Ba'athists that still running around, and the 
potential now for this country to fragment: Shi'ia on Shi'ia, 
Shi'ia on Sunni, Kurd on Turkomen. It's a powder keg. I just 
got back from Jordan. I talked to a number of Iraqis there. 
And what I hear scares me even more that what I read in the 
newspaper. Resources are needed, a strategy is needed, a 
plan. This is a different kind of conflict. War fighting is one 
element of it."</p>
<p>
Zinni displayed little confidence in Bush and his aides. He 
said that their Iraq endeavor has landed the United States 
into the middle of assorted "culture wars" in the Middle East. 
"We don't understand that culture," he remarked. "I've spent 
the last 15 years of my life in this part of the world. And I'll tell 
you, every time I hear...one of the dilettantes back here speak 
about this region of the world, they don't have a clue. They 
don't understand what makes them tick. They don't 
understand where they are in their own history. They don't 
understand what our role is....We are great at dealing with 
the tactical problems--the killing and the breaking. We are 
lousy at solving the strategic problems; having a strategic 
plan, understanding about regional and global security and 
what it takes to weld that and to shape it and to move 
forward."</p>
<p>
Do you think Zinni is angry over the war? He did get worked 
up as he ended his speech:</p>
<p>
"We should be...extremely proud of what our people did out 
there....It kills me when I hear of the continuing casualties 
and the sacrifice that's being made. It also kills me when I 
hear someone say that, well, each one of those is a personal 
tragedy, but in the overall scheme of things, they're 
insignificant statistically." (Perhaps he had in mind the 
comment Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made in 
June, when he played down attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq by 
saying, "You've got to remember that if Washington, D.C., 
were the size of Baghdad, we would be having something 
like 215 murders a month; there's going to be violence in a 
big city.") Zinni continued: "When we put [our enlisted men 
and women] in harm's way, it had better count for something, 
It can't be because some policy wonk back here has a brain 
fart of an idea of a strategy that isn't thought out."</p>
<p>
Brain fart? That's not quite a military term. But those are 
fighting words. And Zinni practically counseled his audience 
to rebel against the Bush administration. U.S. troops, he 
said, "should never be put on a battlefield without a strategic 
plan, not only for the fighting--our generals will take care of 
that--but for the aftermath and winning that war. Where are 
we, the American people, if we accept this, if we accept this 
level of sacrifice without that level of planning? Almost 
everyone in this room, of my contemporaries--our feelings 
and our sensitivities were forged on the battlefields of 
Vietnam, where we heard the garbage and lies, and we saw 
the sacrifice. We swore never again would we do that. We 
swore never again would we allow it to happen. And I ask 
you, is it happening again? And you're going to have to 
answer that question, just like the American people are."</p>
<p>
Brain fart. Garbage and lies. Never again. This was harsher 
rhetoric than Zinni deployed on <i> Nightline</i>, though his 
message was essentially the same. With such talk, he is in 
sync with Senator Ted Kennedy, who was blasted by 
Republicans for calling the war a "fraud." Note to Kennedy 
and other critics of the war: Fire away. If a Republican 
counter-attacks, you can always reply, at least I didn't say 
Bush is asking Americans to give their lives for a war based 
on mental flatulence.</p>
