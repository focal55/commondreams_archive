<p>Rush Limbaugh's demeaning comment on ESPN about Black quarterback 
Donovan McNabb has dominated the news. The statement  was vintage Limbaugh, although 
some insist it was relatively mild compared to his usual diatribes. Limbaugh

said that  McNabb was overrated by the media and inferred that criticism of 
him was toned down because he was Black.  After just a few months, Limbaugh has 
now resigned from ESPN likely because of the reaction to his racist comment as 
well as the recent allegations about him illegally taking prescription drugs. 
 The incident incorporated the blend of white supremacy and corporate 
complicity.

<p>In his article "The Other Race Card: Rush Limbaugh and the Politics of 
White Resentment", anti-racist activist Tim Wise writes that "...what Rush did 
on ESPN was to play the conservative and white version of the so-called race

card. The one that goes like this: 'Black people get treated with kid gloves, 
get coddled, get preferential treatment, get held to a lower standard, get away 
with sub-par performance in ways that no white person could'."
<p>Wise goes on to say that conservative whites "Ignore that fact that the

very same blacks who (they claim) take white jobs are three times more likely 
to be unemployed, even when their  credentials are equal to their white 
counterparts...Ignore the fact that whites are more likely than members of any other 
racial groups to get into their first-choice college, while blacks are least

likely to do so....Ignore the study published in the Journal of Economic 
Literature--actually an analysis of over 200 other studies--which found that

persons who have benefited from affirmative action perform equal to or better than 
their white contemporaries, indicating that not only are they not being held to 
a lower standard, but are meeting whatever standard that exists for everyone

else."
<p>In 1994, I was one of the international observers in the first 
democratic elections in South Africa. The experience was instructive for any number of 
reasons, not the least of which was to better understand the apartheid system 
that kept Blacks from holding government or corporate positions of 
significance. As a white person living in America, I was appreciative of this opportunity 
because I knew that the architects of apartheid drew upon the Jim Crow laws 
in the United States and making comparisons or observing parallels might be 
useful.
<p>Shortly after the elections, I drove with Black South African friends to 
a government office in Cape Town. As usual, the encounter for them was 
frustrating. During the apartheid era, whites were given government and corporate 
positions simply because they were white.  My friends told me that if a job was 
vacant a white needed to be found and hired, often regardless of their 
qualifications, as the most important qualifier was that they were white. When they 
came out of the office they were angry and I suspected it was because of racial 
abuse they probably experienced which was typical in the apartheid state. I 
was wrong. They were furious at the incompetence! The administrator in the 
government office was white and seemingly ill-informed about the policies in

question and my Black friends had to instruct her. They told me that unqualified 
white workers were the norm in South Africa which was, of course, a constant

irritant for them...and further that they invariably had to teach the people in 
charge something about South African policies. 
<p>While I have been an observer of racial discrepancies and hypocrisy in 
the United States, seeing it in another context was helpful. The Cape Town 
experience drove home the insanity of white supremacy and the loss of qualified 
workers, thinkers and creativity we're sure to have experienced in America 
because of our prevailing policies and attitudes toward race. 
<p>Just think about it. Throughout America's history, whites have been 
either appointed to or taken positions of power because they are white and in 
recent years many hail from the South.  It's no wonder the country is in such a 
quandary (i.e. corruption and lies) from Enron to the White House and seemingly 
endless scandals with George W. Bush at the helm. 
<p>For understanding the US today it is perhaps helpful to look at our 
history and what shaped contemporary values. The development of the Mississippi 
Delta in the mid-1800's and how it evolved in molding the South and US values 
generally is a case in point. In his book <i>The Most Southern Place on Earth: The 
Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity</i> scholar James Cobb notes 
writer David Cohn's concession that " his region (the Delta) had rejected 
Calvinist morality and 'the gospel of success with its repellent attributes of 
thrift and hard work."  The success of whites was largely due to the hard work of 
slaves and freedmen who were growing cotton on that rich Delta soil.  White 
plantation owners in the Delta were not plowing the fields nor were their 
managers - they were making slaves do the work and ultimately freedmen. Further, 
relatively few low income white farmers made their way to the Delta due to the 
excessive amount of money and labor needed to clear the land. 
<p>Cobb said that the Delta was driven by extremes of greed and social 
ambition at the expense of humanity and economic equity..."the implications of the 
Delta story" are that in which "material success counted for more than moral

failure, and human and environmental costs were all too often no object at 
all." Cobb ends by inferring that the "larger society" in the United States is becoming much like the Delta. Given the increasing economic disparities in 
America, the corrupt "material seeking" corporate and government leaders, 
environmental degradation and inhumane domestic and international policies to name but 
a few, Cobb has a point. 
<p>Back to Rush Limbaugh and the ESPN incident. ESPN should have known 
better. It should never have hired an inflammatory bigot to serve in such a high 
profile position or any position for that matter. Did ESPN expect Limbaugh to 
tone down his rhetoric when he was hired? This is highly unlikely. We know 
Limbaugh, but perhaps it's time we had a closer look at ESPN, it's ownership and 
political/racial philosophy. At present, the jury's out!
