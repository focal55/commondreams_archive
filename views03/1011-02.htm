<p>One year has passed since Congress authorized President Bush to order an invasion of Iraq. Those lopsided votes by the U.S. House and Senate represented a shameful abandonment of duty by the legislative branch of the federal government and set the nation on a path that has damaged this country&#039;s international reputation, emptied our treasury and cost the lives of at least 323 Americans, allied soldiers and countless Iraqis.
<p>A year into the mess that Bush has made of our country&#039;s international relations, there are many who say they have come to realize that the vote to authorize the president to invade Iraq was a mistake. But it is important to remember that millions of Americans knew it was a mistake in October 2002. That this wisdom was not reflected in the congressional votes is a tragedy.
<p>It is important to remember, however, that a majority of the Democrats in Wisconsin&#039;s congressional delegation voted against the House and Senate resolutions. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and Reps. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison; Gerald Kleczka, D-Milwaukee; Tom Barrett, D-Milwaukee; and Dave Obey, D-Wausau, all voted against authorizing the president to take the steps that led to an unwise and unnecessary war.
<p>Another member of the Wisconsin delegation, La Crosse Democrat Ron Kind, voted for the House resolution. But as the president sent clear signals that he was not going to work with the United Nations or consult with the Congress, Kind became a prominent player in efforts to slow the rush to war. The letter he authored with Ohio Rep. Sherrod Brown was one of the final initiatives to force the president to explain his actions and to detail the costs of war.
<p>The rest of the delegation -- Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and Reps. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville; Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Menomonee Falls; Tom Petri, R-Fond du Lac; and Mark Green, R-Green Bay -- all voted for the resolution and remain little more than cheerleaders for the Bush administration&#039;s failed policies.
<p>The next test for members of the House and Senate will come in votes on the administration&#039;s &#036;87 billion proposal to fund the U.S. occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan -- a pair of countries that the administration promised would quickly become bastions of democracy that could be left to their own devices. Now, this huge expenditure is being described by the administration as a necessary investment in the stabilization of countries that have, in many senses, become less stable since the U.S. invasions.
<p>The United States should not be an occupying force in Iraq or Afghanistan. If those countries need outside administration and policing, it should be done by the United Nations. The only funding that Congress allocates should be the money that is necessary to facilitate the transfer of authority in those two countries to an international force, to support any U.N. initiatives, and to pay for the safe return of our troops to the shores of the United States.
