<p>Did senior Bush officials blow the cover of a US intelligence 
officer working covertly in a field of vital importance to 
national 
security--and break the law--in order to strike at a Bush 
administration critic and intimidate others?
</p>
<p>
It sure looks that way, if conservative journalist Bob Novak 
can be trusted.
</p>
<p>
In a recent column on Nigergate, Novak examined the role of 
former Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV in the affair. Two 
weeks ago, Wilson went public, writing in <i> The New York 
Times</i> and telling <i>The Washington Post</i> about the 
trip he took to Niger in February 2002--at the request of the 
CIA--to check out allegations that Saddam Hussein had tried 
to purchase uranium for a nuclear weapons program from 
Niger. Wilson was a good pick for the job. He had been a 
State Department officer there in the mid-1970s. He was 
ambassador to Gabon in the early 1990s. And in 1997 and 
1998, he was the senior director for Africa at the National 
Security Council and in that capacity spent a lot of time 
dealing with the Niger government. Wilson was also the last 
acting US ambassador in Iraq before the Gulf War, a military 
action he supported. In that post, he helped evacuate 
thousands of foreigners from Kuwait, worked to get over 120 
American hostages out Iraq, and sheltered about 800 
Americans in the embassy compound. At the time, Novak's 
then-partner, Rowland Evans, wrote that Wilson displayed 
"the stuff of heroism." And President George H. W. Bush 
commended Wilson: "Your courageous leadership during 
this period of great danger for American interests and 
American citizens has my admiration and respect. I salute, 
too, your skillful conduct of our tense dealings with the 
government of Iraq....The courage and tenacity you have 
exhibited throughout this ordeal prove that you are the right 
person for the job."  
</p>
<p>
The current Bush administration has not been so 
appreciative of Wilson's more recent efforts. In Niger, he met 
with past and present government officials and persons 
involved in the uranium business and concluded that it was 
"highly doubtful" that Hussein had been able to purchase 
uranium from that nation. On June 12, <i> The Washington 
Post </i> revealed that an unnamed ambassador had 
traveled to Niger and had reported back that the Niger caper 
probably never happened. This article revved up the 
controversy over Bush's claim--which he made in the state of 
the union speech--that Iraq had attempted to buy uranium in 
Africa for a nuclear weapons program. 
</p>
<p>
Critics were charging that this allegation had been part of a 
Bush effort to mislead the country to war, and the 
administration was maintaining that at the time of the speech 
the White House had no reason to suspect this particular 
sentence was based on faulty intelligence. "Maybe someone 
knew down in the bowels of the agency," national security 
adviser Condoleezza Rice said days before the <i> Post</i> 
article ran. "But no one in our circles knew that there were 
doubts and suspicions." Wilson's mission to Niger provided 
more reason to wonder if the administration's denials were 
on the level. And once Wilson went public, he prompted a 
new round of inconvenient and troubling questions for the 
White House. (Wilson, who opposed the latest war in Iraq, 
had not revealed his trip to Niger during the prewar months, 
when he was a key participant in the media debate over 
whether the country should go to war.)
</p>
<p>
Soon after Wilson disclosed his trip in the media and made 
the White House look bad. the payback came. Novak's July 
14, 2003, column presented the back-story on Wilson's 
mission and contained the following sentences: "Wilson 
never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an 
Agency operative on weapons of mass destruction. Two 
senior administration officials told me Wilson's wife 
suggested sending him to Niger to investigate" the 
allegation.
</p>
<p>
Wilson caused problems for the White House, and his wife 
was outed as an undercover CIA officer. Wilson says, "I will 
not answer questions about my wife. This is not about me and 
less so about my wife. It has always been about the facts 
underpinning the President's statement in the state of the 
union speech."
</p>
<p>
So he will neither confirm nor deny that his wife--who is the 
mother of three-year-old twins--works for the CIA. But let's 
assume she does. That would seem to mean that the Bush 
administration has screwed one of its own top-secret 
operatives in order to punish Wilson or to send a message 
to others who might challenge it. 
</p>
<p>
The sources for Novak's assertion about Wilson's wife 
appear to be "two senior administration officials." If so, a pair 
of top Bush officials told a reporter the name of a CIA 
operative who apparently has worked under what's known as 
"nonofficial cover" and who has had the dicey and difficult 
mission of tracking parties trying to buy or sell weapons of 
mass destruction or WMD material. If Wilson's wife is such a 
person--and the CIA is unlikely to have many employees like 
her--her career has been destroyed by the Bush 
administration. (Assuming she did not tell friends and family 
about her real job, these Bush officials have also damaged 
her personal life.) Without acknowledging whether she is a 
deep-cover CIA employee, Wilson says, "Naming her this 
way would have compromised every operation, every 
relationship, every network with which she had been 
associated in her entire career. This is the stuff of Kim Philby 
and Aldrich Ames." If she is not a CIA employee and Novak is 
reporting accurately, then the White House has wrongly 
branded a woman known to friends as an energy analyst for 
a private firm as a CIA officer. That would not likely do her 
much good.
</p>
<p>
This is not only a possible breach of national security; it is a 
potential violation of law. Under the Intelligence Identities 
Protection Act of 1982, it is a crime for anyone who has 
access to classified information to disclose intentionally 
information identifying a covert agent. The punishment for 
such an offense is a fine of up to $50,000 and/or up to ten 
years in prison. Journalists are protected from prosecution, 
unless they engage in a "pattern of activities" to name agents 
in order to impair US intelligence activities. So Novak need 
not worry.
</p>
<p>
Novak tells me that he was indeed tipped off by government 
officials about Wilson's wife and had no reluctance about 
naming her. "I figured if they gave it to me," he says. "They'd 
give it to others....I'm a reporter. Somebody gives me 
information and it's accurate. I generally use it." And Wilson 
says Novak told him that his sources were administration 
officials. 
</p>
<p>
So where's the investigation? Remember Filegate--and the 
Republican charge that the Clinton White House was using 
privileged information against its political foes? In this 
instance, it appears possible--perhaps likely--that Bush 
administration officials gathered material on Wilson and his 
family and then revealed classified information to lash out at 
him, and in doing so compromised national security. 
</p>
<p>
Was Wilson's wife involved in sending him off to Niger? 
Wilson won't talk about her. But in response to this query, he 
says, "I was invited out to meet with a group of people at the 
CIA who were interested in this subject. None I knew more 
than casually. They asked me about my understanding of the 
uranium business and my familiarity with the people in the 
Niger government at the time. And they asked, 'what would 
you do?' We gamed it out--what I would be looking for. 
Nothing was concluded at that time. I told them if they wanted 
me to go to Niger I would clear my schedule. Then they got 
back to me and said, 'yes, we want you to go.'" 
</p>
<p>
Is it relevant that Wilson's wife <i> might</i> have suggested 
him for the <i> unpaid</i> gig. Not really. And Wilson notes, 
with a laugh, that at that point their twins were two years old, 
and it would not have been much in his wife's interest to 
encourage him to head off to Africa. What matters is that 
Wilson returned with the right answer and dutifully reported 
his conclusions. (In March 2003, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency concluded that the documents upon which 
the Niger allegation was based were amateurish forgeries.) 
His wife's role--if she had one--has nothing but anecdotal 
value. And Novak's sources could have mentioned it without 
providing her name. Instead, they were quite generous. 
</p>
<p>
"Stories like this," Wilson says, "are not intended to 
intimidate me, since I've already told my story. But it's pretty 
clear it is intended to intimidate others who might come 
forward. You need only look at the stories of intelligence 
analysts who say they have been pressured. They may have 
kids in college, they may be vulnerable to these types of 
smears."
</p>
<p>
Will there be any inquiry? Journalists who write about 
national security matters (as I often do) tend not to big fans of 
pursuing government officials who leak classified 
information. But since Bush administration officials are so 
devoted to protecting government secrets--such as the 
identity of the energy lobbyists with whom the vice president 
meets--one might (theoretically) expect them to be appalled 
by the prospect that classified information was disclosed 
and national security harmed for the purposes of mounting a 
political hit job. Yet two days after the Novak column's 
appearance, there has not been any public comment from 
the White House or any other public reverberation. 
</p>
<p>
The Wilson smear was a thuggish act. Bush and his crew 
abused and misused intelligence to make their case for war. 
Now there is evidence Bushies used classified information 
and put the nation's counter-proliferation efforts at risk merely 
to settle a score. It is a sign that with this gang politics 
trumps national security.
