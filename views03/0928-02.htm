<p>So, you're mad as hell, and you're not going to take it anymore. The 
powerful spirit of populism is now channeling through California's body 
politic: "Throw the rascal out!" And Gray Davis is a fine specimen of 
rascality: an ice-veined governor who catered to big donors and simmered the 
books in Sacramento until they exploded with red ink.
<P>But the winds of populist anger rarely reach gale force on their own. In 
politics, no one should expect a perfect storm to occur by accident. Much more 
than a pressure system is needed. Lots of money and access to media help. So 
do calculated ambiguities.
<P>Just about every candidate tries to sound anti-elitist. In or out of office 
-- from the left, right or center -- politicians rail against "special 
interests" (either defined or kept vague). Campaigners insist they just want 
to help citizens reclaim their government.
<P>"Most people are eternally taken in by the myth and rhetoric of democracy," 
says Gray Brechin, the author of a book about the Golden State's development, 
"Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin."
<P>"What we have now is an increasingly uneducated public -- especially in 
what used to be called civics -- dealing with evermore complex issues with 
which they are unequipped to knowledgeably deal," Brechin says. "We have a 
population ripe for manipulation by powerful public relations firms and 
political consultants who are expert in sound bites and seductive imagery."
<P>The recall grew from genuine grass roots but germinated on political 
Astroturf.
<P>While high octane populist anger fuels the state's first gubernatorial 
recall, the vehicle for it would not have budged without Darrell Issa's $1.7 
million jump-start. Now, three replacement candidates are in the front seat 
with a realistic chance to win: a pair of Republicans along with Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante, who is chairman of the California campaign for Sen. Joe Lieberman -- the most conservative contender for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination.
<P>Fury at Gov. Gray Davis hails from all over the ideological map, but not a 
single plausible winner on the recall ballot is more progressive than the 
corporate centrist now in the governor's office. This situation must be 
gratifying to those who initiated the process.
<P>From the outset, anti-tax crusader Ted Costa has been a key promoter of the 
recall. As chief executive of the People's Advocate organization, he formally 
launched the drive by filing a recall petition with the secretary of state's 
office on Feb. 5, the same day that leading Republicans announced a parallel 
effort. Costa walks in the footsteps of his longtime mentor, Paul Gann, the 
People's Advocate founder who 25 years ago co-authored Proposition 13 -- the 
most enduring legacy of California's electoral populism in the last half 
century.
<P>When voters approved it as an amendment to the state Constitution in 1978, 
the proposition's appeal was widely obvious, but the long-term devastating 
impacts weren't. The measure not only capped annual property taxes at 1 
percent of assessed value, it also imposed a 2 percent limit on yearly 
increases in valuations and froze assessments entirely for existing owners. 
Prop. 13 nailed local governments to the lowered property-tax ceiling.
<P>Californians, says Brechin, "really hadn't a clue about what they were 
doing to themselves and the public life of the state. And, unfortunately, the 
effects of Prop. 13 were masked because (then-Gov.) Jerry Brown used the state 
surplus to bail out the counties that would have had to almost immediately 
begin shutting down all sorts of public and emergency services had he not done 
so. When the real effects began kicking in, people couldn't make the 
connection. . . . The decline in the quality of public life only made them 
angrier and riper for more manipulation."
<P>For corporations and homeowners, Prop. 13 has been a gift that keeps on 
giving. It's a prime example of contorted populism that rewrites the social 
contract, inserting fine print that undermines the middle class and the poor. 
We're still dealing with grim results while government in California fails to 
meet immense social needs -- for health care, education, housing, employment 
and environmental protection.
<P>The recall battle is another historic turning point for California. Yet 
insufficient scrutiny has been devoted to Costa and the organization that he 
heads. Aptly described by media outlets as "leading the campaign for the 
recall" and "ground zero of the recall movement," Costa and People's Advocate 
are marketing a type of well-heeled populism with a nativist odor.
<P>For many years the president and then chairman of the People's Advocate 
board of directors was Dan Benvenuti Sr., a Sacramento-based real estate 
magnate who is now an emeritus board member. The vice president of People's 
Advocate is Stanley Diamond, coordinator of the California English Campaign.
<P>The Web site of People's Advocate proudly explains that Diamond worked in 
the mid-1980s to pass Proposition 63, making English "the official language of 
California." Diamond now "heads up the efforts of People's Advocate to enforce 
the provisions of Prop. 63 and represents People's Advocate in the national 
effort to make English the official language of the United States."
<P>People's Advocate -- the organization with the most pivotal role in the 
launch of the recall -- appears to fit the profile of what authors Chip Berlet 
and Matthew N. Lyons refer to as "repressive populist movements." Such 
movements "deflect popular discontent away from positive social change by 
targeting only small sections of the elite or groups falsely identified with 
the elite, and especially by channeling most anger against oppressed or 
marginalized groups that offer more vulnerable targets."
<P>Consider the indignant tone and anti-immigrant undertow of the declaration 
that's featured in the "California English Campaign" section of the People's 
Advocate site: "The Legislature has thus far failed in its official duty to 
implement Prop. 63. In fact, our research found that the Department of Motor 
Vehicles (DMV) offers the driver's license exam in 37 languages! AND the DMV 
employs approximately 8,000 people who act as 'translators.' To add insult to 
injury, the Attorney General has issued an opinion stating that the voters' 
will was merely 'advisory' and not binding on the state."
<P>Some very different populist voices are being heard in the recall campaign. 
The inclusion of progressives Arianna Huffington and Peter Camejo in debates 
has widened the spectrum of public discourse. But in a state with a population 
larger than many countries, Huffington and Camejo lack the multimillion-dollar 
campaign war chests necessary to win a race for governor.
<P>In political arenas, the broadness of populist sentiment is its strength 
and weakness: The rage is unmistakable, but the proclaimed solutions with the 
highest media decibels tend to be vague and simplistic.
<P>Everyone except a die-hard Davis loyalist can blame the governor for the 
state budget wreck. But when Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom McClintock talk 
about the need to make California more friendly to business, their stump 
speeches ignore the ways the governor's undue deference to huge corporations 
was a crucial factor in electricity price-gouging as well as in the state's 
budget mess. And, given Bustamante's career-long political swoon for corporate 
power, it would be unwise to take very seriously his newfound populist 
effusions about challenging big business.
<P>"When an election came up during a time of rapid social change and 
increasing problems," the seasoned progressive journalist Carey McWilliams 
wrote soon after Ronald Reagan won the governorship in November 1966, "the 
people of California fled reality. Instead, they indulged in a ritual 
cleansing, and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the 
basis of being a political innocent." Thirty-seven years later, another 

"ritual cleansing" may be in the offing, with foreseeably dire consequences.
<P>Yet it would be a mistake to denigrate the power of populist action to 
improve our society. The fact that anti-elitist rhetoric is often useful to 
elites for their avaricious schemes is no reason to be cynical about the 
potential value of idealistic activism at the grass roots. "History -- and 
certainly the history of our country -- is the story of people struggling, 
always going uphill against the powerful to seek a little more democracy, a 
tad more justice, a slightly wider sliver of the economic pie," progressive 
populist Jim Hightower writes in his new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031410/commondreams-20" target="_new">Thieves in High Places.</a>"
<P>But it is not progressive populism that has stampeded California to its Oct.
7 rendezvous with recall destiny. The election is extraordinary, but the 
pattern is familiar. "Popular anger and desire for easy answers to complex 
problems have been manipulated time after time by special interests and elites,
" Brechin points out. "The referendum and initiative have been used to 
essentially hamstring and bankrupt the state, especially since Prop. 13." 
Looking ahead, he speculates gloomily that "the recall of Davis, and 
especially the election of Arnold, may well be the final nail in the golden 
coffin, except for those who are wealthy enough to provide themselves with 
private security."
<P>If Davis is recalled, he won't be the first or last politician to ride out 
of Sacramento festooned with tar and feathers. Nor will his replacement be the 
last corporate bootlicker to arrive on a spiffy white horse while spouting 
populist hosannas.
<P>A central problem with throw-the-bum-out populism is that plenty of other 
bums are cued up and, in the absence of a coherent analysis of inequities or a 
program for structural reform, the underlying problems remain. This is not to 
blame populism for modern-day political demagoguery any more than we should 
blame religion for the fundamentalist madness of terrorists and militarists. 
But assertions of religious faith -- or heartfelt populist zeal -- are no 
assurances of anything.
