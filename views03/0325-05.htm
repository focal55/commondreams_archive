<p>U.S. forces are closing in on Baghdad to bring freedom to the Iraqi 
people. On the home front, federal authorities are expanding their 
surveillance of U.S. citizens.
<P>The White House decries treatment of U.S. soldiers captured in Iraq. Yet 
Afghan fighters held by the United States are deliberately denied protection 
under the Geneva Convention.
<P>"It's a complete double standard," said Beth Givens, director of the 
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a San Diego nonprofit organization. "How can we 
preach democracy in Iraq while the government is doing all these other things 
at home?"
<P>This is what civil liberties advocates are asking as the war in Iraq 
intersects with America's war on terror.
<P>"The policies are deeply contradictory," said Pamela Karlan, a professor at 
Stanford Law School who specializes in constitutional law.
<P>No one disputes that law enforcement authorities need to be fully equipped 
to defend the flock from predators. The question critics are asking is how 
many freedoms and legal protections should be sacrificed in the name of 
national security.
<P>"We're living in a whole new world," acknowledged Randall Scarlett, a San 
Francisco attorney who focuses on civil rights cases. "But the degradation of 
citizens' rights cannot in any way be considered a healthy and decent thing to 
do to our democracy."
<P>The latest apparent drop in that bucket is news that the U.S. Justice 
Department has significantly increased use of emergency powers enabling it to 
tap phones and seize personal records without a court's prior approval.
<P>Attorney General John Ashcroft has personally signed more than 170 
"emergency foreign intelligence warrants" allowing wiretaps and searches of 
people deemed threats to national security.
<P>His use of this little-known measure is in fact three times greater than 
that of all other U.S. attorneys general combined over the past 23 years.
<P>"In the post-9/11 world, it shouldn't be a surprise that more emergency 
warrants are being issued," said Mark Corallo, a Justice Department spokesman 
in Washington. "The reason you're doing it is because you're going after spies 
and terrorists."
<P>That would be suspected spies and terrorists?
<P>"Right."
<P>Corallo also stressed that all the anti-terrorism moves have been upheld in 
court, including in the U.S. Supreme Court, which on Monday rejected -- albeit 
on procedural grounds -- a challenge to the government's broader surveillance 
powers.
<P>"This is all within the law," he said. "We're on solid legal ground and 
solid constitutional ground."
<P>But Stanford's Karlan countered that the same was said when courts upheld 
the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and loyalty oaths 
during the McCarthy era.
<P>"The Justice Department may be succeeding in the short run," she said. "It 
will be a different question when we look back 10 years from now and ask 
whether the courts got it right."
<P>Civil liberties advocates have been crying foul ever since passage of the 
Patriot Act in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and 
Pentagon. It expanded the government's ability to conduct surveillance and 
searches.
<P>Meanwhile, they can't help but take note of President Bush's insistence 
that captured U.S. soldiers in Iraq be treated in accordance with the Geneva 
Convention, which requires that prisoners of war "must at all times be 
protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation."
<P>However, the more than 600 prisoners captured by U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan and held at a military facility in Cuba have been denied POW 
status and are instead termed "unlawful combatants." They do not, in turn, 
fall under the safeguards of the Geneva Convention.
<P>"It's a stark example of doublespeak," said Ann Beeson, an attorney for the 
American Civil Liberties Union in New York.
<P>"Protecting civil liberties in this country should serve as an example to 
the rest of the world," she said. "The promise of democracy in Iraq rings 
hollow if we're gutting our own core liberties at home."
<P>What about national security?
<P>"No one's saying you shouldn't vigorously go after terrorists," Beeson 
replied. "But in a democracy, you comply with the Bill of Rights before you do 
it."</p>
