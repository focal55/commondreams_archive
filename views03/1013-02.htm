<p> I well remember the day I decided to move to America.

<p> As part of a story I was doing, I was trying to get some information from the U.S. Justice Department, and the press office was not returning my calls. In what I thought was an act of desperation, I dialed the switchboard and asked to be put through to the official who had written the document I was enquiring about.

<p> When I introduced myself and told him what I wanted, he said, "Is this conversation on or off the record?"

<p> Nothing unusual in that, my U.S. colleagues will think. But to someone working in Britain, where a cold call to an equivalent official in the Home Office would have been met -- at best -- with a curt "call the press office," it was a revelation.

<p> And the more I learned, the clearer the epiphany became.

<p> Here was a country where the legislature could subpoena members of the Cabinet and force them to give testimony under oath; where presidential candidates released their tax returns and medical records; and where the Freedom Of Information Act made it illegal -- ILLEGAL -- for federal officials not to return journalists' phone calls and answer their questions.

<p> Even the knowledge that "no comment" constituted an answer could not dampen the heady rush that knowledge gave to someone born in a country where every government document not specifically made public is an official secret.

<p> But now it seems, that balance is changing. And -- at least from my vantage point on the western side of the pond -- in the wrong direction.

<p> In recent weeks, I have followed with increasing astonishment the work of the Hutton inquiry. The inquiry is looking into the apparent suicide of David Kelly -- a government scientist who was the source for a half-baked and badly reported story by BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the production of a dossier laying out the prime minister's case for war with Iraq.

<p> It was like a car wreck, I couldn't look away. 

<p> The revelations about last minute changes to the dossier "suggested" by Prime Minister Tony Blair's office are bad enough. 

<p> Still worse is the complete cynicism of officials revealed by the diary of Blair's spin-doctor, Alistair Campbell. The document was reportedly released to the inquiry in the teeth of government opposition -- and one can easily see why.

<p> It paints a lurid picture, complete with four-letter words, of how determined Campbell and Defense Minister Geoff Hoon were to "get the source out" -- reveal Kelly's identity -- in order, to quote the diary, to "f--k Gilligan."

<p> Of course the inquiry suffers from the touches of eccentricity that characterize any undertaking by the British judiciary. Like the ban on any recording or broadcast of the proceedings, and the consequent -- and sometimes unintentionally hilarious -- nightly TV re-enactments of crucial exchanges.

<p> But that in no way dulls the excitement of seeing on the Web, the Web, for goodness sake, copies of correspondence between the head of MI6 -- an organization that, until less than 20 years ago, the British government did not even formally admit existed -- and the Cabinet secretary -- the apex and archetype of that permanent and secretive establishment, Her Majesty's Civil Service.

<p> Parenthetically, historians may note the highly ironic contrast between the two occasions on which Iraq has humiliated this quintessentially British institution in less than a decade.

<p> After all, the last time the civil service's hallowed curtain of secrecy was plucked aside to such embarrassing effect was during the Scott inquiry in 1995. That was a probe into the Thatcher government's shameful collaboration with efforts to supply Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein with exactly the kind of banned weapons -- in this case, a ballistic-ranged "supergun" -- that the Blair government gave as the reason for going to war against him.


<p> As one comedian remarked recently: "How do we know he's got weapons of mass destruction? Simple -- we kept the receipts!"

<p> But while Hutton -- precipitated and egged on by a news media aggressive as a pit bull -- has torn away emperor Tony's new clothes, revealing his government's behind-the-scenes cynicism in all its weasely nakedness, it's been a very different story so far over here.

<p> At least six congressional committees could claim that their jurisdiction covers the criminal investigation into the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame, allegedly in revenge for husband Joe Wilson's public criticism of the administration's case for war against Iraq.

<p> But the Republican chairmen of those committees -- who, like their Democratic counterparts, usually take every opportunity to assert and expand their turf -- have either maintained a deafening silence on the issue, or -- remarkably -- denied that the issue fell within their ambit.

<p> "I don't think that runs (under) our committee's jurisdiction," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, recently. 

<p> Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the whole executive branch, called it "a law enforcement issue."

<p> "It's appropriately handed by the Department of Justice," she said. "They've got an investigation underway."


<p> And the career prosecutors there who are overseeing that investigation will doubtless do a diligent job. But it seems Congress is much less likely to fulfill its obligations. Oversight doesn't mean very much if it doesn't include probing the machinations of government when they may have involved lawbreaking and the deliberate release of classified information.

<p> But it seems that Plame-gate, as it is inevitably being dubbed, is a political hot potato that no Republican to want to touch. 

<p> More significantly, the same appears to be true of the broader questions about the evidence on which the U.S. government based its case for war.

<p> The simple truth is, the facts on the ground have not borne out the assessment of the most extensive -- and most expensive -- information gathering and processing machinery in human history: the U.S. intelligence community.

<p> At best, U.S. intelligence got it wrong -- and it's no defense to say, as some have, that everyone else got it wrong, too. At worst, it might have got it wrong because of pressure from Cabinet-levels officials to come up with politically expedient answers. 

<p> Although some of these same issues ended up under the Hutton inquiry's harsh light, the real arc lamp of its investigation was shone elsewhere -- at Kelly's shameful outing and subsequent suicide. There are already calls in Britain for another inquiry, this time aimed directly at how the government made its case for war.

<p> Britain -- having investigated its own "outing" scandal so rigorously -- is already one step ahead of my adopted home in the transparency stakes. I hope, for my sake and the sake of everyone else here, that the United States doesn't fall any further behind.
