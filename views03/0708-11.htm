<p>In his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," Martin Luther King Jr. 
 lamented a "tragic misconception of time," namely, "the        
 strangely rational notion that there is something in the very  
 flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills." Today, Dr.   
 King's observation ought to serve as a cautionary note to      
 those who have seized upon Justice O'Connor's wishful          
 expectation that, "25 years from now," race-conscious          
 admissions policies "will no longer be necessary."  Indeed,    
 the stark racial disparities in educational opportunity that   
 persist even as we approach the 50th anniversary of Brown vs.  
 Board of Education compel us to re-assess our societal faith   
 in the curative effects of time.                               
                                                                
                                                                
<p>The conclusion of the Michigan litigation brings with it an    
 opportunity to replace the corrosive debate over affirmative   
 action with, at the very least, a twenty-five year             
 collaboration on the project of solving the problems that      
 create the need for race-conscious policies in the first       
 place. If, as critics claim, affirmative action is simply a    
 "band-aid" for deeper social ills, then continuing warfare     
 over this inadequate remedy should take a back seat to the     
 collective effort to find real and lasting solutions to racial 
 disparities in educational opportunity.                        
                                                                
                                                                
<p>However, there are reasons to question whether critics of      
 affirmative action are the champions of educational equality   
 that they claim to be. One might wonder, for example, why no   
 serious steps were taken by successful proponents of           
 Proposition 209 in California and Initiative 200 in Washington 
 to advance educational equity in primary and secondary         
 schools. After all, their message to voters was that while     
 affirmative action did not provide the key to educational      
 opportunity, direct intervention in failing schools did.       
                                                                
                                                                
<p>Unfortunately, these "champions of equality" did not put their 
 money where their mouths were. The millions that could have    
 been spent to support fledgling efforts to equalize schools    
 were used instead to fund other attacks on the so-called       
 band-aid solutions. If the patient is indeed educational       
 equity, its life is slipping away while those opposed to the   
 band-aid fail to offer basic life support.                     
                                                                
                                                                
<p>In the aftermath of the decision in Grutter, the continuation  
 of the well-funded and highly organized campaign to eliminate  
 diversity-based affirmative action programs will only foment   
 racial strife. The consequences of this assault are            
 particularly troubling during a time when it is clear that our 
 collective interests are advanced by utilizing all our         
 citizens' talents and focusing on what holds us together as a  
 nation. While the generals in this war against diversity say   
 they want to put this strife behind us, one suspects that      
 their sentiments are more akin to those of Justice Scalia, who 
 bemoans the endless litigation Grutter may spawn while         
 simultaneously dictating line and verse the litigation         
 strategy for attacking the decision in that case.              
                                                                
                                                                
<p> Fortunately, opponents of affirmative action do not represent  
 a monolith. Justice O'Connor, surely not a liberal on this     
 matter, pointed the way forward by parting company with those  
 who seem intent to inflame racial resentment rather than focus 
 energies on the common goals laid out in Brown. Conservatives  
 similarly concerned about our society's future should follow   
 her lead and set out their own agenda.                         
                                                                
                                                                
<p>Achieving the goal set forth by Justice O'Connor is no small   
 undertaking. Setting goals is easy; serious soul searching     
 about our willingness to bear the cost of equalizing           
 educational opportunity is far more challenging. A declaration 
 of détente would enable the infrastructure that conservatives  
 have built to wage the war on affirmative action - the think   
 tanks, law firms, and foundations - to be retrofitted to       
 attack instead the underlying inequalities. Indeed, what       
 better target exists than the education juggernaut itself,     
 which provides such differential rewards and burdens to        
 different races, classes, and regions? For that matter, why    
 not broaden the attack to include unwarranted reliance on      
 measures of merit which hinge a lifetime of opportunities on   
 dubious standardized exams, undervaluing the potential of      
 millions of whites as well as people of color?                 
                                                                
                                                                
<p>Justice O'Connor's aspiration was not an invitation to wait    
 for racial equity to develop in the by and by. As King has     
 taught us, "time itself is neutral; it can be used either      
 destructively or constructively." We should also decline       
 Justice Scalia's de facto invitation to endless litigation.    
 The resources that might be tapped to reverse this modest      
 decision will be far better directed at the significantly more 
 pressing problem of securing real educational opportunity in   
 this country.
