<p>As the echo of the war drums fades away and the angry masses calling for
    blood slowly disperse, we, as a nation must now confront the truth. We face
    the unpleasant reality of an uncertain future, compromised safety, a failing
    economy, and the question of how a society of otherwise reasonable citizens
    was systematically lied to and manipulated into backing the political
    "hijacking" of Iraq.</P>
<P>Before a single bomb was ever dropped, some of us,
      formerly called the "anti-American and unpatriotic," have questioned or
      opposed this war.&nbsp; Now, each day, as the dust settles and the truth slowly
      surfaces, more and more people come to the inevitable conclusion of what a
      debacle this whole war was.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>39,000 bombs later, no weapons of mass destruction
    uncovered, no dangerous dictators captured, no connection to Sept 11. What have we gained but relentless media coverage of a fallen statue
    and some stolen oil fields -- the spoils of this misadventure. Not to
    mention lucrative corporate payoffs and an enormous price tag of over 80
    Billion dollars . . . some tax cut.</P>
<P>But what have we lost? We have lost the lives of over
    300 Americans.&nbsp; Approximately 2 U.S. troop deaths each day, 193 deaths since
    the war was declared over. In total, an estimated 20,000 people have died,
    thus far, in this conflict.</P>
<P>In addition to the lives given for this effort, our
    nation has suffered the loss of respect within the world community,
    particularly the United Nations.&nbsp; We have managed to squander any goodwill
    we once had to now succeed in solidifying our image as the globe's leading
    bully.&nbsp; Arrogant and thoughtless. </P>
<P>The word Democracy means literally "by the people."&nbsp;
    This is the basis of our government and society.&nbsp; It is what this country
    was founded upon and what makes us American.&nbsp; It is not just our "right" but
    also our duty to speak out and voice our thoughts and opinions.&nbsp; How, then,
    was it possible that, in the land of freedom, those who opposed the common
    opinion were called."un-American?"&nbsp; Resentfully, we wonder.&nbsp;    </P>
<P>The song "To Washington" was met with criticism and was
    labeled an anti-war song.&nbsp; That was not at all the case or intention; it was
    merely a report of the political climate, in the age-old tradition of the
    troubadour spreading the news through song and story. Professionally, we,
    the Mellencamps, have the opportunity to travel extensively, and we take
    full advantage of that by talking to, listening to, and experiencing the
    diversity our vast country has to offer.&nbsp; The lyrics of "To Washington" are
    not just a personal opinion, but also the view from a very wide horizon.</P>
<P>Who is to say what is or isn't "patriotic?"&nbsp; Do the
    flags that wave from every minivan really offer any support?&nbsp; Where is the
    support for the thousands of service men and women who return to the states
    to see their benefits cut, their health problems ignored, their jobs gone
    and their families living in poverty?&nbsp; How are they repaid for their
    efforts; for risking or losing their lives?&nbsp; So far, dismally.</P>
<P>This nation was founded to enable freedom and diversity
    of opinion, and many lives have been lost to secure that liberty.
    Paradoxically, some still resist the open mindedness that is the very
    foundation of this country.</P>
<P>The Governor of California was removed from office
    based on finance troubles. And yet George W Bush has lied to us, failed to
    keep our own borders secure, entered a war under false pretense, endangered
    lives, and created financial chaos.&nbsp; How is it that he hasn't been
    recalled?&nbsp; Perhaps this time we could even have a real election . . . but
    that wouldn't fit the Bush administration's "take what you want and fire
    people later" policy.&nbsp; Take an election; take an oil field; take advantage
    of your own people -- a game of political Three-Card Monte. </P>
<P>The fight for freedom in this country has been long,
    painful, and ongoing.&nbsp; It is time to take back our country. Take it back
    from political agendas, corporate greed and overall manipulation.&nbsp; It is
    time to take action here in our land, in our own schools, neighborhoods,
    farms, and businesses. We have been lied to and terrorized by our own
    government, and it is time to take action.&nbsp; Now is the time to come
    together.</P>
