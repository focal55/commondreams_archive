<P>There are many things to be said against condoms, and most people
reading this have probably said them all. But at least they work. Not
perfectly--they slip, they break, they require more forethought and
finesse and cooperation and trust than is easy to bring to sex every
single time, and, a major drawback in this fallen world, they place
women's safety in the hands of men. But for birth control they are a
whole lot better than the rhythm method or prayer or nothing, and for
protection from sexually transmitted diseases they are all we have. This
is not exactly a controversial statement; people have been using condoms
as a barrier against disease as long as rubber has been around (indeed,
before--as readers of James Boswell's journals know). You could ask a
thousand doctors--ten thousand doctors--before you'd find one who said,
Condoms? Don't bother.

</p>
<p>

But what do doctors know? Or the Centers for Disease Control, or the
World Health Organization, or the American Foundation for AIDS Research
(Amfar)? These days, the experts on condoms are politicians, preachers
and priests, and the word from above is: Condoms don't work. That is
what students are being taught in the abstinence-only sex ed favored by
the religious right and funded by the Bush Administration--$117 million
of your annual tax dollars at work. The theory is that even mentioning
condoms, much less admitting that they dramatically reduce the chances
of pregnancy or HIV infection, sends a "mixed message" about the value
of total abstinence until marriage. How absurd--it's like saying that
seat belts send a mixed message about the speed limit or vitamin pills
send a mixed message about vegetables. Anti-condom propaganda can
backfire, too: True, some kids may be scared away from sex although
probably not until marriage; others, though, hear only a reason to throw
caution to the winds. According to a 2002 Human Rights Watch report on
abstinence-only sex ed in Texas, a condoms-don't-work ad campaign led
sexually active teens to have unprotected sex: "My boyfriend says they
don't work. He heard it on the radio." Why is the Bush Administration
giving horny teenage boys an excuse to be sexually selfish? You might as
well have high school teachers telling them using a condom during sex is
like taking a shower in a raincoat.

Now it seems the Vatican is joining fundamentalist Protestants to spread
the word against condoms around the globe. "To talk of condoms as 'safe
sex' is a form of Russian roulette," said Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, head
of the Vatican's office on the family. On the BBC <i>Panorama</i>
program "Sex and the Holy City," Lopez Trujillo explained, "The AIDS
virus is roughly 450 times smaller than the spermatozoon. The
spermatozoon can easily pass through the 'net' that is formed by the
condom." That latex has holes or pores through which HIV (or sperm) can
pass is a total canard. A National Institutes of Health panel that
included anti-condom advocates examined the effectiveness of condoms
from just about every perspective, including strength and porosity;
according to its report, released in July 2001, latex condoms are
impermeable to even the smallest pathogen. Among STDs, HIV is actually
the one condoms work best against. "We're all a bit stunned by Lopez
Trujillo's lack of respect for scientific consensus," Dr. Judith
Auerbach of Amfar, who sat on the NIH panel, told me. "Where do his
numbers come from?" Is Lopez Trujillo, who even suggests putting
warnings on condoms like those on cigarettes, a loose cannon such as can
be found in even the best regulated bureaucracies? According to "Sex and
the Holy City," in Africa, where HIV infects millions--20 percent in
Kenya, 40 percent in Botswana, 34 percent in Zimbabwe--Catholic clergy,
who oppose condoms as they do all contraception, are actively promoting
the myth that condoms don't prevent transmission of the virus and may
even spread it. The <i>Guardian</i> quotes the archbishop of Nairobi,
Raphael Ndingi Nzeki, as saying: "AIDS...has grown so fast because of
the availability of condoms." Thus is a decade of painstaking work to
mainstream and normalize condom use undone by the conscious promotion of
an urban legend.

When the Nobel Prize for Peace was awarded to Shirin Ebadi, the first
ever to a Muslim woman, an Iranian and a crusader for women's rights,
not everyone was thrilled. What about Pope John Paul II, now celebrating
the twenty-fifth anniversary of his election, and possibly near death?
"This...was his year," wrote David Brooks in his <i>New York Times</i>
column, a hymn of praise for the Pope as the defender of "the whole and
the indivisible dignity of each person." A few pages over, Peter
Steinfels said much the same in his religion column: "Is there any other
leader who has so reshaped the political world for the better and done
it peacefully?" More knowledgeable people than I can debate how much
credit the Pope should get for the fall of Communism--I always thought
it was Ronald Reagan with an unintentional assist from Gorbachev plus
the internal collapse of the system itself. With the crucial exception
of Poland, the countries in the old Soviet bloc aren't even Roman
Catholic, or are so only partially. Whatever his contribution to that
historic set of events, though, the Pope is on the wrong side of history
now. Women's equality, sexual rights for all, the struggle of the
individual against authoritarian religion and of course the global AIDS
epidemic--the Pope has been a disaster on all these crucial issues of
our new century. It's all very well for David Brooks to mock those who
critique the Pope for his "unfashionable views on abortion," as if
78,000 women a year dying in illegal procedures around the world was
just something to chat about over brie and chablis. But add it up: a
priesthood as male as the Kuwaiti electorate--even altar girls may be
banned soon, according to one recent news story--no divorce, no
abortion, no contraception, no condom use even within a faithful
marriage to prevent a deadly infection.
</p>
<p>

It's bad enough to argue that condoms are against God's will while
millions die. But to maintain, falsely, that they are ineffective in
order to discourage their use is truly immoral. If not insane. </p>
