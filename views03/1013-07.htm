<p>HANADI JARADAT, a 27-year-old Palestinian apprentice lawyer, once dreamed of having a career and children. Instead, she joined the Islamic Jihad, 

secretly crossed into Israel, charged into a Haifa restaurant, shot a security guard, blew herself up and murdered 19 innocent civilians. 

<p>Though both her family and community grieve for her, they also embrace her martyrdom.  

<p>What kind of society praises the suicide of its young? What has happened to a people who willingly sacrifice young women, universal symbols of life, the promise of future generations? 

<p>Such criminal acts and grotesque attitudes are the result of a society that has lost all hope and is driven by despair. 

<p>For Palestinians, as well as Israelis, this catastrophic cycle of revenge is a great tragedy. For Israelis, moreover, it is now impossible to "profile" a suicide bomber. Any Palestinian woman, absent a scarf, can readily pass for her Israeli counterpart. 

<p>The Israeli response to these events has been to escalate the conflict and bomb a purported terrorist training camp in Syria. Borrowing a page from the Bush Doctrine, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has decided that Israel, 

like the United States, has a right to attack pre-emptively any nation that might harbor terrorists. 

<p>What will end this murderous cycle of terrorism and revenge? Unfortunately, neither Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat nor Sharon appears willing to create a lasting peace. Nor is the United States a neutral peace broker in the Middle East. In fact, the United States bears great moral responsibility for the crimes against humanity that both sides have committed. 

<p>Why? Because Bush's so-called "road map" to peace is a farce. The president claims to have a vision of a two-state solution, but at every turn, he has failed to condemn Sharon's expansion of new settlements, the bombing in Syria, the targeted assassinations of suspected terrorists, the bombing of Palestinian homes, the bulldozing of their communities, or the construction of a wall. 

<p>Rejecting a land-for-peace solution, Sharon has instead created a string of Bantustans, loosely tied together by spaghetti-like roads. But peace will only come when Palestinians gain a viable and coherent state. 

<p>Peace is possible. We should never forget that this intifada, which has killed hundreds of people and maimed thousands more, began in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon entered the holy Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif area with armed soldiers. Before that provocative act, the Israeli people had enjoyed years of relative security. 

<p>The war in the Middle East is too dangerous for us to remain silent. Last week, I spent Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in spiritual contemplation and reflection. I thought about how much we Americans are complicit in Israel's self-destructive policies. It is our government, after all, that gives Israel billions of dollars in aid and offers loans and guarantees for new settlements. 


<p>I realize these views will elicit accusations of anti-Semitism or Jewish self-hatred. The truth is, in my case, I know a great deal about anti-Semitism. 

<p>The Nazis killed most of my families' relatives; I spent a lonely childhood because anti-Semitic parents forbade their children to play with a Jewish child. 

<p>I also know the difference between opposing Israeli state policy and anti- Semitism. Nevertheless, I worry about how easily worldwide condemnation of Israeli policies could morph into virulent anti-Semitism. 

<p>The best way we can ensure the survival of Israel is to condemn Sharon's failure to freeze settlements and be prepared to withdraw U.S. political and financial support until Israel complies with Bush's road map to peace. 

<p>Suicide bombings will only end when young people believe in a future with hope, rather than despair.
