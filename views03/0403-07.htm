<p>Where women appear in public life right now in the West, there seems to be nothing distinctively female about what they are doing. There are a few eager-sounding women sitting in coalition tanks. A prisoner of war held by the Iraqis is a woman, while another, "girl soldier" Private Jessica Lynch, was rescued yesterday. In Britain, some of the most forceful pro-war voices, from Barbara Amiel to Melanie Phillips, are female. And as for the female voices in politics, such as that of Condoleezza Rice, they tend to sound pretty much indistinguishable from the bellicose growl of the men.

<p>Does this mean that one of feminism's old arguments, that more powerful women would make the world a better place, has stalled? After all, you might ask what the point is of going on agitating for women to get into public life – if they are indistinguishable from men once they get there.

<p>But, for a start, even if it were the case that powerful women didn't try to rearrange the furniture in the corridors of power, I would still want to see them there. That is because I believe equality between men and women is something worth working for, even if it doesn't make the world a sweeter place. Just as it wasn't necessary 100 years ago to believe that women would vote differently from men to say that they should have the vote.

<p>And I still think you can be certain that if women did actually attain equality, the world would look very different. I'm talking about equality. Yes, equality; not the pitiful token presence in public life that women have right now. The examples I quoted above – that solitary high-profile American female politician, a tiny percentage of soldiers in non-combat roles, a few prominent commentators – do not make for equality. Nowhere near.

<p>All they do is to provide a couple of spots of color in what is still a monochrome masculine world. It would be absurd to think that even the United States has yet got anywhere close to equality. If you hear people arguing it has, remember that just 13 per cent of American politicians are women.

<p>So even when women get to carry out orders or explain orders or support orders, that doesn't mean that these are orders that women have participated in forging. Over and over again, when we are shown pictures of the most powerful people in the world, going from meeting to meeting at Camp David, or in the UN debating chamber, or in our very own Parliament, what we see is cluster after cluster of men, with maybe, just maybe, the occasional woman looking on from the outskirts of the group.

<p>It almost sounds too obvious, when I put it like that. It almost sounds naive to go on being outraged by this constant and overwhelming imbalance. And it seems to be swimming against the tide to try to remind people that it doesn't have to be like this. This is not what most feminists are interested in debating right now. On the contrary, feminism in the West seems to have moved from the dissection of the world around us to the dissection of the worlds within us – to the guilts that plague women and the psychological expectations that hold us back.

<p>Yet it is worth restating that these two sides to women's experiences, their frustration in public life and their frustration in their personal lives, are intimately connected. It is because so many men have so utterly failed to take on more responsibility in the sphere of family and home that so many women still feel overwhelmed in their personal lives. And while women take on the full weight of domestic work, they are unable to do any more than keep their own patch of turf in order, let alone try to move around the bigger fields of politics and activism and protest and leadership.

<p>We cannot just accept the siren voices of complacency that tell us that women are happy with the world as it is, that they would all rather retreat to the warm dream of becoming a domestic goddess than face the cold winds outside the home. The fact that progress in the West seems to have stalled on this reality, of the impossibility of women moving on in the world at large until men move on in small ways in the home, is not something to be complacent about. A shocking new book of essays by various American women writers, The Bitch in the House (published by Viking, edited by Cathi Hanauer) exposes the rawness of the situation that we are in now in the West.

<p>Many of the writers in this book lift the lid on the ways that women are still shouting and striving and bellyaching and raging in order to try to get men to take their responsibilities at home at all seriously. The honesty with which these writers expose their fury at the current situation is all the more staggering because our culture tends to assume that women like these – women with good jobs and nice husbands and gorgeous children – are, or should be, contented with their lot.

<p>Just as so many women in the West are, still, looking for changes at home, many women are still also looking for change in the wider world. We should not underestimate how many women are feeling alienated from the political tenor of our times. The latest polls on the war show that women in the UK have not been won over by the supposed requirement to support our soldiers in action. A third of women, as opposed to a quarter of men, believe that this war is going badly. They are repelled by the extent of civilian casualties to a much greater extent than men, and are more ready to question the aims of the war; 82 per cent of women now believe that soldiers should only strike at targets if there is little or no risk of civilians being killed.

<p>Given the kind of fighting that is now going on in Iraq, that means more and more women are being alienated from what is being done by our forces. Despite the fine words of the coalition leaders, we can see that this war is being fought by trigger-happy soldiers who cannot – or will not – distinguish military from civilian targets, and that the primary victims of this war are injured children and weeping parents.

<p>You do not have to believe in any old-fashioned myths about women naturally being peace-loving to understand why more women than men might tell pollsters that they find this unacceptable. While the gap between the people who do caring work and the people who are powerful is still so great, politicians will go on taking decisions that will alienate more women than men.

<p>Given how long feminists have been making these arguments, it feels almost like time to despair. But perhaps the young women who have just started taking to the streets in their first ever protests against the status quo will find that one day they, and their partners, have the will and the energy to break down those barriers that currently look so immutable.
