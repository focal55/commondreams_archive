<p>You may have already seen it. It was a proclamation to the people of Baghdad, signed by the newly self-installed "Lieutenant-General, Commanding Army of Occupation" - an army including a few Australian troops. Some excerpts: 

<p>"Our military operations have as their object defeat of the enemy and the driving of him from these territories. In order to complete this task, I am charged with absolute and supreme control of all regions ... but our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators ...

<p>"It is the wish not only of my [leader], but it is also the wish of the great nations with whom he is in alliance, that you should prosper even as in the past, when your lands were fertile, when your ancestors gave to the world literature, science and art and when Baghdad city was one of the wonders of the world ... 

<p>"But you people of Baghdad, whose commercial prosperity and whose safety from oppression and invasion must ever be a matter of the closest concern to [my government], are not to understand that it is the wish of that government to impose upon you alien institutions.

<p>"It is [our] hope that the aspirations of your philosophers and writers shall be realized and that once again the people of Baghdad shall flourish, enjoying their wealth and substance under institutions which are in consonance with their sacred laws and their racial ideals."


<p>The point, of course, was that this proclamation was signed by one F.S. Maude, on March 19, 1917 - just a few months before he tragically died from cholera - when the Brits, with Australian help, had successfully wrested Baghdad from the clutches of the Germans and the Turks during World War I. (The Allies feared Baghdad being used as a base for operations launched against them.) And if in reading it now there is a sense of deja vu , so too must there be some recognition that the great weight of history is not on the "coalition of the willing's" side.

<p>(A moment here, to allow the more jingoistic of my journalistic brethren to draw a bead on anyone who would dare to do anything other than alternate between cheerleading for the war, and sneer-leading against those who do not share their confidence that everything will proceed perfectly from this point on.)

<p>Still, this is not an isolated view. When Colin Powell, the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the United States, was asked in 1992 why American forces had not pushed on to Baghdad after routing the Iraqis in Kuwait in 1991, he replied that it was because he did not wish for American forces to find themselves right in the middle of 5,000 years of Mesopotamian history.

<p>Of course, it is possible that all of us who marched against the notion that the way to world peace was to drop more bombs on the Middle East, are wrong. 

<p>We all - despite the many attempts to paint us otherwise - earnestly hope we are wrong. We hope that the estimated 20,000 protesters who yesterday marched against the US presence, across Iraq - ten of whom were killed and 100 wounded by American troops at the protest in Mosul - are way less representative of the collective Iraqi will than the 150 who pulled down Saddam's statue with the help of an American tank in front of the international media's hotel last week. 

<p>If two years from now peace indeed reigns across a democratic and prosperous Iraq, if the beacon of Baghdad shines across the rest of the Middle East, showing the way forward to a peaceful prosperity that they too could enjoy, if by that time the awesome cache of weapons of mass destruction on which the whole war was justified have indeed been discovered, if international terrorism is less of a problem ...

<p>then, terrific. Our demonstrated lack of wisdom in being so comprehensively proved wrong will be as nothing to the knowledge that our children will grow up in a stable world, and our hats will go off to all who made the right call. 

<p>On the strength of what we've seen so far, however, our best hope is that Iraq does not turn into complete and utter chaos, and produce an environment which breeds precisely the kind of terrorists the whole action was intended to quell. Oh, that we may be proved wrong.
