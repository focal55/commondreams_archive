<p>AUSTIN, Texas -- One interesting aspect of the Seriously Dumb Tax Cut 
we are watching develop in Washington is that we are simultaneously 
witnessing the effects of Seriously Dumb Tax Cuts at the state level. The 
states are plotzing right and left, caught in hideous binds -- whether 
it is better to release dangerous prisoners or cut back the schools, 
cut back health care for kids or nursing homes for old folks.
	<p>Politically, it's notoriously difficult to oppose tax cuts precisely 
because the trouble doesn't show up until after the next election, but 
this time we have are having our noses rubbed in the results even as 
Bush proposes to do it again at the federal level.
	<p>And what a tax cut it is. According to <a href="http://www.ctj.org/" target="_new">Citizens for Tax Justice</a>, the 
wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, those who make over $356,000 a year, 
will get almost 50 percent of the benefit of eliminating the tax on 
dividends and 45 percent of the money from accelerating the rate cuts. The 
80 percent of the households making less than $73,000 a year would get 
less than 10 percent of the new tax breaks.
	<p>The Bushies have various ways of justifying this monstrosity, none of 
which holds up under scrutiny. The first claim is that the rich pay 
more in taxes in the first place. Well, yeah, they do: They have more 
money. The richest 1 percent have 18 percent of all the pretax income and 
they pay 36 percent of all personal income taxes. But one of the many 
disingenuous tricks with statistics you will see used by the Soak the 
Poor school is to ignore the rest of the tax burden. Most of us actually 
pay more in payroll taxes than we do in income taxes, but FICA taxes cut 
OFF at $87,000 -- you make more than that, you don't have to pay on the 
rest. And of course the sales tax is notoriously regressive -- rich 
families and poor families alike pay the same sales tax on a refrigerator, 
but it's a much bigger chunk of the income of the poor family.
	<p>Despite all the screaming and yelling, the progressive income tax is 
the fairest form of taxation ever invented (unless you want to count the 
wealth tax used by most European countries). When Dwight Eisenhower 
left office, the highest marginal tax rate was 95 percent and no one 
thought Ike was a communist. It's now down to 38.6 percent and due to drop 
to 35 percent. For 70 years, the income tax has made at least part of 
the total tax picture here progressive, rather than regressive. It's not only 
unfair to change that, it's stupid.
	<p>Bush is now arguing that we need a tax cut because the economy is in 
recession.  Originally, he argued for a tax cut because the economy was 
so good. It is true that a balanced budget is not the be-all and 
end-all of good governance -- that's one of those panaceas we occasionally 
fall for -- and running a deficit at the federal level is not the end of 
the world or necessarily even bad policy. Tax cuts can stimulate the 
economy. But note the long, circuitous thinking about giving tax cuts to 
the rich: If the rich have more money, they will invest it -- and that 
investment will allow companies to expand, and then they will hire more 
workers, and that will end the recession. Whereas, if you give tax cuts 
to the middle and working classes, they go out and spend the money 
because the baby needs new shoes. Presto, demand is up, factories back in 
action, end of recession.
	<p>There's no guarantee that rich people will do anything economically 
productive with more money. Their major strategy seems to be stashing it 
in offshore banks so they don't have to pay any taxes. As Leona 
Helmsley so famously remarked, taxes are for "little people." The dirty little 
secret about taxes in this country is that rich people and corporations 
mostly don't pay them now -- they have a whole system of shelters and 
offshore deals. We don't need to raise taxes in this country, we need to 
collect them.
	<p>The centerpiece of the Bush tax cuts is eliminating dividend taxes, 
effective immediately, on the grounds that the dividends are "taxed 
twice" -- by the corporate income tax and then the dividend tax. This one 
has absolutely nothing to do with economic stimulus, it's a pure 
give-away to the rich. 
	<p>One reason dividends should be taxed is because the people who get 
them don't work for the money. In the old days, people who lived off their 
investments were known as "coupon clippers" and generally despised as 
non-working parasites. Granted, it takes some smarts to do well enough 
in the stock market to live high (and somebody, like your granddaddy, 
had to make the money in the first place), but the fact is most investors 
don't spend their lives poring over company prospectuses -- they pay 
someone else to do it. They're making money off other people's labor. Why 
shouldn't they pay taxes on it?
	<p>The final reason it's dumb to cut taxes for the rich is the problem of 
social justice. We're already in trouble because the income gap between 
the rich and the rest of us keeps getting worse and worse. The rich buy 
their way out of our public institutions -- schools, hospitals, parks 
-- and then contribute money to politicians who let the public 
infrastructure go to hell. It doesn't work.<p align="center">&copy; 2003 Creators Syndicate</p>
