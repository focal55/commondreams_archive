<p>Dear Friends,

<p>It is impossible to describe.  It is like we are
submerged in a glowing yellow-orange cloud here in the
city.  Our Iraqi friends say they have never seen
anything like it.  It is eerier than any science
fiction film I've ever seen.  Some say it is caused by
a combination of the burning oil and the billowing
smoke from the bombs.  Both near and far the bombs
continue to fall.  

<p>Heavy bombing woke me out of a deep sleep last night. 
Earlier I'd been on the telephone  with a friend who
told me that in her neighborhood a missile had struck
the day before wounding 29 and killing 5.  Among the
dead was a 12 year old.  "Cathy" she said, "please
tell them (the U.S.) to stop talking about
humanitarian aide."  Apparently this keeps coming on
over the television news.  "Please tell them to shut
up!"  How ludicrous to speak of humanitarian aide as
the country is being bombed, people being killed and
wounded and their homes destroyed!   

<p>The Bush administration said a couple of days ago that
the war has been successful because so far there have
been only 500 casualties.  I am anxious to get word to
you about some of these "casualties" as I've been to
the trauma hospitals these last 3 days to see for
myself.  This is not to mention the trauma of fear and
terror of the bombing which has no end.  As I write
you the bombs continue and the windows threaten to
explode.  Should I move somewhere else?  There really
is no safe place.

Nada Adnan, 14 years old and a student at high school for girls, states &quot;I wish that God would take Bush. Why did he do this to us? to me?&quot;. She has an open gash on her right cranium with underlying fracture and a large, deep shrapnel gauged cut into her upper left thigh. She has no narcotic relief and cries out as aides press guaze into her leg wound. <br>

</table></font>Let me tell you about Amar, a 7 year old boy whom I
saw in the hospital this morning.  He has an emergency
chest tube to drain blood as he suffered multiple
shell injuries.  His mother, Hannah, died in the
direct hit to their house this morning. He is from a
farming village on the outskirts of Baghdad.  Then
there is Mueen, 8 years old also the son of a farmer,
but from another area.  He is in the bed alongside
Amar and also has a drainage tube.  But his is from
the abdomen.  The doctor showed us a plastic bag
holding parts of his small intestine which had to be
removed during surgery in order to try and get to all
of the shrapnel.  His father died in that bombing, and
his 6 year old brother Ali was wounded in the head.   
 
<p>Shall I go on?  Ten year old Rusel was wounded in an
explosion outside her door.  We saw the shrapnel in
her chest on the Xray and she too has a chest tube. 
Her right hand is fractured.  I had seen her yesterday
and to my surprise she remembered me.  We played with
the finger puppet of the frog for a moment and I
decided to leave it with her.  I told her that I was
going to tell other children what a brave little girl
she is.  Her father said "Bush said he'd bring
democracy to Iraq.  This is not democracy.  This is
terrorism!"  

<p>Nada Adnan is a 14 year old high school student who
came in with a deep gash and fracture to her right
forehead.  She also has a hunk of shrapnel in her
upper thigh..
Some of our folks were present when she and her family
were brought into the hospital.  Her mother had to be restrained as she was so distraught.  A missile had crashed into her uncle's home where they were staying, causing the walls to collapse. Nada's 8 year old sister had died as a result.  Nada said "Is this good what is happening here?  How many children have been killed?  How many wars they've done to us?  And we have so much pain.All the countries know that Bush has committed a crime."

<p>An elderly woman, Fatima, had fallen in fear during
the bombing and fractured her hip.  She had already
had surgery for the hip, but her ankle too is in a
cast and her knee is wounded.  Mohammed her husband
said  "We are not the enemy or against you.  We love
freedom for everyman, for every human in the world. 
Bush is not human.  He is the enemy against humanity."
 
<p>We meet Ali and his wife in the hospital, the parents
of four young children.  They tell us that they want
the war to stop for the children's sake, for the
mothers.  They say that families are all leaving their
homes to run away from the bombs.  They try and stay
all together at one of their relatives homes.  "If we
die, we want to die together."  Ali works in a food
shop, they explain.  But all of the stores are closed
and there is no work.  No money coming in.  The
children no longer go to school.  All of their
children are fearful and hiding under the covers.  

<p>And Mr. Bush says the war is successful.  Children
maimed for life.  Children orphaned in an instant. 
Their homes destroyed.  Their young men forced to
fight.  A peaceful people visited by unspeakable
terror and violence.   Oh tell me Mr. Bush, what
should I do with my anger, with my rage?  Can you tell
me what to say to the people here when they ask me
what have they done?, when they ask me why is this
happening?  

<p>They know I am from America.  As I meet their
questioning eyes and despairing expressions I have no
words.  Mr. Bush, shall I tell them that the war so
far is a success.  I can only say "I'm sorry" on
behalf of us all.  And, please God stay the hand of my
nation.  

<p>Love,<br>
Cathy
