</table></font>Dave Borell did the humane and proper thing when he tried to get medical treatment for those wounded children.  That he was moved to tears when he couldn’t help them speaks volumes about him and the decency of the human spirit in hellish situations. 

<p>But for those of us watching from the comfort of home, do not shed too many tears for these particular youngsters.  Rather, save them, and multiply them by a million and a million more, for all the suffering Mr. Bush’s war has caused and will cause. 

<p>Save them for the children and adults, Iraqi and American, shot through with shrapnel, burned, terrorized in their sleep, horrified from watching loved ones blown to bits in front of their eyes.  Save them for the survivors who’ve begun a lifetime of grief. 

<p>Save them for the children to be born to the veterans of this war, and for hundreds of generations of Iraqi children yet unborn, who will come into this life defective and sick from the genetic effects of depleted uranium weaponry.  Save them for those here who will be victims of the violence certain to be spawned by Mr. Bush’s dirty little war. 

<p>Even as George Bush’s lies propelled us toward war in Iraq, millions of us here and around the globe demanded peace.  Less than a month before the bombing began, Charlie Liteky, a Vietnam vet and Medal of Honor recipient and I told the international press corps in Baghdad that we were embarking on a journey to take a message to U.S. troops waiting in Kuwait.  Two days later, across no-man’s land at the Iraq-Kuwait border, Charlie’s voice boomed it through the still, desert air, audible to soldiers on the other side, and we handed it to UN representatives for delivery to U.S. troop commanders.  It said in part: 

<p>“Our prayer for every one of you is for a quick return to families and loved ones without having to participate in the horrors of war.  We recognize that you have been placed in a position of anxiety and danger, and we share in the responsibility for you being here.  We recognize you are in this position because back home we do not truly govern ourselves—but are instead ruled by a minority who decide questions of war and peace in the interests of the few instead of the many.  Our inadequate democracy has led us into deadly quagmires in the past, and now to the brink of another conflict that can only be described as a tragic war of empire. 

<p>“…The decisions we make in the next few days and weeks will forever change the lives of millions of people.  Not only will you, our American brothers and sisters in the armed forces suffer greatly if war is waged, but so will the family we have come to know here in Iraq—the common, decent, ordinary people who populate this country’s cities and villages; who work in its shops and restaurants; go to school; practice their religion; celebrate birthdays and weddings and funerals; who, like the innocents in every war will bear the greatest suffering—and who are virtually indistinguishable from our families back home, especially in their desire for peace.  Indeed, it was General and President Dwight Eisenhower who told us, ‘Remember that all people of all nations want peace.  Only their governments want war.’  We ask you, our fellow citizens, to think with your head and your heart and do the right thing.” 

<p>Our efforts and those of millions of people around the globe were obviously not enough.  As one international activist I met in Baghdad said, “this isn’t only about war, it’s about democracy.  Our governments are taking us to war against the will of their people.” 

<p>That is true and difficult to stop.  And so another generation of young men and women has experienced what no should ever have to see.  When will we learn?
