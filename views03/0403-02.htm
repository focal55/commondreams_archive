<p>America invaded Iraq because, George W. Bush said, Saddam Hussein posed a danger to America. So America will pay for the war, won't it? Not necessarily.<P></P>Who will verify the weapons of mass destruction that America will "find" in Iraq? United Nations inspectors, right? Wrong.<P></P>Who will control post-Saddam Iraq? The U.N., under a trusteeship, no? No.<P></P>The 1991 Gulf War, which cost $60 billion, was paid for almost entirely by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which had invited the American forces in. Having marched in uninvited this time, America does not have anyone to pay the big bills. Yet.<P></P>"I expect we will get a lot of mitigation, but it'll be easier after the fact than before the fact," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told Congress long before the start of the war.
<P></P>Consider President Bush's recent request to Congress for a $75 billion war appropriation as merely bridge financing. <P></P>
The money will be recovered from future Iraqi oil revenues. Or from those for whom the neighborhood has been made safe from Saddam, principally Israel and Kuwait. Don't be surprised if the Kuwaitis are leaned on for protection money.
<P></P>Who should organize relief work in Iraq? <P></P>
The United Nations, say Tony Blair and Colin Powell. But Bush, vice-president Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld <i>et al </i>are not keen. They think the U.S. military can handle humanitarian aid and look good doing it.<P></P>But 13 leading relief agencies, including Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders, refused to enter Iraq under any authority but the U.N.'s. So America supported last week's 45-day extension of the U.N.'s oil for food program, suspended when the war began.<P></P>Who should pay for the aid?<P></P>The U.S. Agency for International Development has an idea: Tap into the $8 billion oil for food escrow account.<P></P>So, Iraqis must pay for the humanitarian crisis caused by the United States. <P></P>Who will be the Lakhdar Brahimi of Iraq? He is the U.N. special envoy co-ordinating relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction work in Afghanistan. <P></P>No one, if Bush has his way. <P></P>He has named a former American general to be the military governor of post-war Iraq. Jay Garner, head of the Pentagon's new Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, is already in Kuwait, waiting to enter Iraq.<P></P>But America and Britain do want the U.N. to bless his rule. <P></P>"The important thing is that we end up with something that is U.N.-endorsed," said Blair. <P></P>So, having violated the will of the U.N., America wants the U.N. to legitimize its illegal invasion &#8212; <i>and</i> bless its post-war governor.<P></P>But Washington does not want the U.N. to do any post-conflict nation building of the sort it has done in the post-Cold War era.<P></P>James Baker, secretary of state to former president George W.H. Bush, confirmed that yesterday.<P></P> Speaking in Toronto, he said the U.S. would oppose a U.N.-led "cumbersome and politicized administration" in post-war Iraq. Translation: Butt out.<P></P>General Garner will thus keep political control until he puts in place a puppet government. Along the way, he will ensure that Americans have first dibs at the war booty.<P></P>Under the oil-for-food program, the U.N. was supervising Iraqi agencies supervising the pumping of about 2 million barrels a day for revenue of about $13 billion a year. We can guess who will control the production and the revenue from now on &#8212; the U.N. or the U.S.?<P></P>The bigger honeypot is the reconstruction of the entire Iraqi infrastructure. That's about a $100 billion job.<P></P>Who will pay for that?<P></P>International law requires "occupying belligerents" to repair the damages caused in a conflict. But the Bush administration wants the funds to come principally from Iraqi oil revenues.<P></P> So, Iraqis will pay for fixing the damage wrought by the Americans. And preferably pay it to American corporations.<P></P>Back in February &#8212; when Bush was ostensibly working for a peaceful solution through the U.N. &#8212; his administration called for bids to rebuild a post-war Iraq. It restricted the bidding to U.S. companies, contrary to the procurement rules of the World Trade Organization.<P></P>Criticism forced Halliburton, Cheney's former employer, to pull out of the bidding.<P></P> But Bechtel and other benefactors of the Republican party are very much in the running, to the chagrin of British corporations.<P></P>Among Garner's other jobs, he will have to settle the issue of the $170 billion outstanding Iraqi reparations to Kuwait from the 1991 war. Plus the $60 billion Iraqi foreign debt, mostly to Russia. Which is why, it was said, Russia has been behaving the way it has, opposing American intervention. <P></P>But the spectacle of America jockeying for preferential financial arrangements in every aspect of post-war Iraq is jarringly at odds with the declared noble mission of liberating Iraqis and introducing much-needed freedom and democracy to the region.<p><i>Haroon Siddiqui is The Star's editorial page editor emeritus.
