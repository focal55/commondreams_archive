<p>A man wearing a T-shirt reading “Give peace a Chance” is arrested at a Mall (private property) in Albany. On February 15th protestors were forbidden to march in New York City. The vice president’s lawyer sent a threatening letter to a website that parodied Lynne Cheney. The bare breasts on the statue of a woman that stood behind John Ashcroft as he gave briefings were draped. The tapestry of Guernica at the U.N. was also draped and covered during interviews with diplomats discussing war with Iraq. Poets were disinvited to the White House when it was learned thay had anti-war verses and they intended to read them. False reports of Osama bin Laden’s sons being captured aired fifteen minutes before the Security Council at the UN convened to hear Hans Blix’s report on the disarmament of Iraq. An accurate report that North Korea was planning missile tests in the Sea of Japan aired twenty-five minutes before the same Security Council convened. Colin Powell’s voice cracked several times as he made a case for military action following speeches from the German, Russian and French ambassadors making a case for a peaceful resolution.  Jack Straw, without listening to the interpretation of Mohammed Aldouri, the Iraqi ambassador to the UN, was caught on camera sharing a laugh with a US diplomat as the ambassador from Iraq was speaking. The US diplomat was sitting in Colin Powell’s seat. At the exact same time Mohammed Aldouri was making his case before the Security Council, Colin Powell was conducting a press conference that aired on all cable news. The image most of the American people saw and heard was Powell answering questions with an insert of the Iraqi ambassador. Powell was heard again, Aldouri was a silent moving image. Powell did say that the last thing anyone wants is war. Bush said no one wants war. Timothy McVeigh was a Gulf War veteran. Most Iraqi citizens say they will fight an invading force. The prisons in Iraq have been emptied. It has been widely reported that Saddam Hussein has ordered military uniforms that look like American and British uniforms and that his soldiers will wear those uniforms, perform atrocities on their countrymen and blame the Americans and British. Any democrat would beat George Bush in an election held right now. The New York Times reports that 3,000 “precision guided” missiles will hit Baghdad if the inspections are abandoned and Bush gives the order. The decision is Bush’s alone to make. Bush did not win the popular vote. A restaurant owner in Long Island poured a thousand dollars worth of French wine down the toilet in protest to France’s resistance to U. S. military action against Iraq. The envoy from the Pope, who believes that an attack against Iraq would be immoral and illegal, was given a photo op session with Bush. The customary live cameras and microphones were not used for that visit. The Pope also intervened on behalf of Karla Faye Tucker to then Governor Bush. Bush did not show clemency and she was executed. Bush claims to lose no sleep over the executions allowed under his watch as Governor of Texas.  Texas used to be part of Mexico, it was then an independent state for nine years, was annexed by the US and war with Mexico followed. Mexico supports the inspections and a peaceful resolution to the Iraq crisis. Senior journalist Helen Thomas was scrubbed and marginalized at the recent and rare press conference held by Bush. She made the statement the he is the worst president she has ever covered. At this press conference Bush mentioned September 11th eleven times and yet no journalist asked him about the progress of the investigation into September 11th. No connection has been made between Iraq and September 11th. The president's job is to keep the American people safe.
<p>Tommy Franks is ready. France will veto. Bush prays for peace.
