<p>"Mission accomplished," declared the Top
Gun as he staged the most elaborate photo-
opportunity of his presidency, landing an S-3B
Viking aboard the Abraham Lincoln aircraft
carrier. That was six months ago, and little did he
know that the war in Iraq was just beginning. The
occupation is a disaster, Americans are getting
killed nearly every day, and President Bush will
be lucky if this war doesn't run him out of office
like Vietnam did to President Lyndon B. Johnson.

 <p>        Welcome to the spin zone. The war is
starting to spin out of control, but there's another
issue that could make or break Bush's re-election
bid depending on how it is perceived by American
voters: the economy.

<p>         The U.S. economy has lost 2.8 million
jobs since February of 2001. Unemployment
stands at 6.1 percent of the labor force, not
including the millions who are working part-time
because they cannot find full-time jobs, or those
who have given up looking for work.

<p>Despite fast-growing productivity, real
wages have barely grown over the last year.

Soaring health care costs -- including an
increasing share shifted to employees -- have
taken a big bite out of most people's income.
Millions of older workers are now slogging past
their planned retirement to make up for the
savings they lost in the stock market crash and
corporate crime wave.

<p>         But President Bush has made a political
career out of setting the bar low enough --
remember the Presidential debates of 2000? -- that
anything less than Great-Depression-style failure
could possibly be spun by the Bush team as
success.

<p>         And they are trying, with Treasury
Secretary John Snow boasting that the economy
would create 200,000 jobs a month over the next
year.

 <p>        But the economy needs to create more
than 150,000 jobs each month just to employ new
entrants to the labor force and keep the
unemployment rate from rising. Even if Snow's
prediction were to come true, the 200,000 jobs per
month would still not make up for the 2.8 million
jobs lost since President Bush took office.

 <p>        Mr. Bush is well on his way to being the
first president since Herbert Hoover, more than 70
years ago, to preside over a net loss of jobs.

 <p>        Some have argued that the economy is
recovering fast enough, but that productivity -- the
amount of output produced per hour of labor -- is
growing too much. According to this argument,
since businesses can produce more and more with
fewer labor hours, they're not hiring more
employees.

<p>         But this is not true. Productivity always
grows more rapidly after a recession, and this
recovery is not much different from the last five --
going back to the 1960s -- in terms of productivity
growth. The problem is simply that the economy
has not grown fast enough -- as it did in previous
recoveries -- to create new jobs.

 <p>        To be fair, the Bush team is not
responsible for the recession that officially began
in March of 2001. That was caused by the
collapse of the stock market bubble, an entirely
foreseeable event that all of our political leaders --
and the press -- should have warned us about. But
the Bush team can be blamed for not doing
anything to counteract the downturn.

<p>         For example, they could have provided
federal funds to the state governments, which are
reducing employment and economic growth as
they try to close an $80 billion shortfall. But
instead they chose to rewrite the tax code in favor
of their very richest contributors, creating chronic
fiscal deficits far into the future -- while providing relatively little economic stimulus at present. And they embarked on a costly war, based on false pretenses, with no end in sight.

 <p>        The economy generally looms large in any
Presidential election. Al Gore would most likely
be president today if he had chosen to campaign
on the economy, as most political observers
expected he would. After all, his administration
had presided over the longest economic expansion
in American history. But for reasons that remain
unexplained, he chose not to make a major issue
out of it.

 <p>        The Democratic candidate this time is
unlikely to make the same mistake. He might take
a page from Ronald Reagan, who in 1980
famously asked voters, "Are you better off than
you were four years ago?" For most Americans,
even those fortunate enough to be employed, the
answer next year will probably be no.
