<p>At 7 a.m. on any weekday, in any city in the country, you can tune in to "The War Show!"<p> Switch on any television network and you'll see stern morning show anchors promoting their war coverage, all of it with bold titles like "Brink of War," "Showdown With Iraq" and "Greetings From the Front." <p> Correspondents standing in front of the White House repeat the threats President George W. Bush made to Saddam Hussein the night before, as if the warnings were coming from their own lips. The anchors conduct daily interviews with U.S. generals who discuss their invasion plans in front of huge maps of Iraq.<p> "How prepared is the Air Force?" NBC's Katie Couric asked Secretary of the Air Force James G. Roache the other day, a leading question if ever there was one.<p> "We're ready," the secretary replied, as if there could be any other answer.<p> Correspondents and anchors who are "embedded" with U.S. troops in Kuwait describe the massive U.S. military buildup along the Iraqi border and how few troops Saddam Hussein has. We see pictures of Cobra helicopters, Brady tanks and scary B2 bombers, and the anchors ask the generals to describe even-scarier weapons, like the 21,000-ton "Mother of All Bombs," and the E-bomb, which allegedly explodes in the sky, destroying all of the enemy's communications systems. The anchors and reporters gush about how "high tech" the U.S. military operations are, compared to the last Gulf War. And, of course, there are pictures of U.S. soldiers, who, we're told, are itching to get into battle, so they can get home sooner.<p> The network news shows aren't covering the war, they're promoting it. Their message is that the United States is powerful and righteous, that we're prepared to give Hussein a good whipping, and that anybody who opposes us is suspect.<p> One of the most gratuitous segments on television this week was an interview Charles Gibson of "Good Morning America" did with Fox News talk show host and ranter Bill O'Reilly about French opposition to the war. <p> "They sold us out," O'Reilly said, calling the French "weasels." "Don't buy French stuff!" he added.<p> Now and then, the shows throw in a piece about how the war's actually going to kill a lot of people, increase the threat of terrorist attacks on us because it's making people around the world very angry, and probably hurt the economy. But the coverage is mostly bellicose and rah-rah-rah. It's tragic that the Bush administration has brought the world to this state of anxiety, fear and conflict over a war based on false pretenses. That the networks are partners in this deception makes it worse.<p> "It's outrageous," says John R. MacArthur, a publisher of Harper's magazine and the author of "Second Front," a book about press coverage of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. MacArthur feels that "television in its raw form works as propaganda" in times of war.<p> Why? The networks depend on the government - for licenses, access to the military, pictures - so they don't ask hard questions about the administration's actions. And since the Democrats have punked out of criticizing the war for fear that it'll hurt them politically, the press have no war opposition to feed off of.<p> Not that the newspapers have done much better. So many war-mongering stories were promoted by the Bush administration that later turned out to be specious or totally fabricated - like Hussein's alleged attempts to develop nuclear weapons and his supposed ties to Osama bin Laden. Newspapers have spread them just like the networks. But because television coverage is so relentless, so aggressive in parroting the administration's lines, its impact is greater.<p> I once worked at a television network and I know these are highly intelligent people. I'm tempted to say they must really believe what the administration says about this war. But I also know that they believe it partly because they want to, need to, because war is such a great television story. <p> It's hard to watch "The War Show!" without lamenting that the people who're supposed to be covering the war are shamelessly exploiting it.
