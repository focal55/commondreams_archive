<p>The American Film Institute just put out its top 10 list of movie heroes and villains of the last 100 years. "Atticus Finch" was listed as good guy numero uno.
The Harper Lee-inspired character was made famous with Gregory Peck's portrayal in one of my personal all-time favorite movies, "To Kill a Mockingbird."

<p>The top bad guy honors went to "Dr. Hannibal Lecter," played by one of my favorite thespians Anthony Hopkins in "The Silence of the Lambs." Hopkins also played Lecter in the two other murderously entertaining installments based on Thomas Harris' trilogy of novels.

<p>Atticus and Hannibal, though polar opposites in many ways, both share a common trait - an amazing ability to empathize. Atticus tried to inculcate that old Indian wisdom into Scout and Gem - you have to walk around in someone's moccasins a mile or two before you can accurately discern the meaning of their behavior.

<p>Dr. Lecter helped the FBI catch other serial killers because of his ability to feel and understand the inner-workings of dis-eased souls.

<p>What fascinates me about Lecter is his sheer absurdity. He's an intellectual, cannibalistic, serial-killing, forensic psychiatrist who has a pallet for fine wine and Renaissance art.

<p>Whether Harris (Lecter's creator) meant to or not, he has given us a potent symbolic figure for our criminal justice system - a schizophrenic institution whose endtrail, the penitentiary, does as much harm to the common good as it does to preserve it.

<p>To see what I'm getting at, allow me to play a little mind-game first. Call it the Evil Dr. Lecter exercise, where the objective is to wreak havoc on society by creating as many crime victims as possible.

<p>First, a few observations: It appears that most people define justice as making sure that those people get what they deserve. And, according to conventional wisdom, criminals deserve to be punished.

<p>A few other simple observations: Most criminals are never caught. Convicted criminals are only that minority of law-breakers who are either stupid enough, brazen enough, poor enough or unlucky enough to get caught. And, finally and most importantly: The majority of convicted criminals will eventually be released.

<p>Now, playing the role of evil bad guy, I would try to distract people so they don't see how ridiculous it is to believe "the crime problem" will be greatly affected by what we do with the minority of criminals who are actually caught. But with so many business-as-usual politicians muddying the media trying to look "tough on crime," I'm covered on that front.

<p>Playing an all-powerful Dr. Lecter, I would devise a penal system where prisons serve as a cages for convicted criminals (people who already feel cheated by society) and then I strip them of what little bit of human dignity they might still possess, treating them like bad children in a laboratory rat maze.

<p>Then, because "they deserve it," I would house violent and nonviolent offenders together, deny them the right to vote and make it as difficult as possible for any of "them" to get an education or job training so they can be left to teach each other the tricks of the trade. You know, a real crime university.

<p>But when all of the non-lifers get released is where my evil plan all comes together. Uneducated, jobless and treated as a moral leper by "respectable people," I have helped to exponentially increase the chances that the ex-con will commit more crimes, thus creating many, many more future victims.

<p>Of course, no evil scheme can work without a little help from good Christians - true believers that have yet to digest the words of their Savior who said things like "judge not...(and)...be like God who makes the sun shine on the just and the unjust." What did the religious call for? "Crucify him!"

<p>In my evil plot, I wouldn't want Christians to start thinking that maybe Jesus wasn't so much teaching ye shall do this or ye shall do that, but merely making an observation that if ye want thy life and thy society ye live in to work as it was designed, discern with empathy...but "judge not."

<p>Wait a minute. That was just a game. But what I just described is the system we actually have. And that's more frightening than Dr. Lecter.
