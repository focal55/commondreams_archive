<p>I thought for a moment that I was going to be "liberated by the masses" from my temporary jail in the north Chinese countryside. The wooden doors to the courtyard where I was being held were flung open by three or four broad-shouldered peasants who advanced upon my captors: a crowd of murmuring villagers followed them. Their advance slowed to an uncertain halt. Faced with the village policeman and some junior police officers from the nearby town, my new friends hesitated and, without a word on either side, drifted back outside again. 
I was left to contemplate my crime: I had not applied for permission (which I knew I would be refused) to visit this village. I would have to wait for more senior officials to arrive so that I could be interrogated, sign a ritual confession, and be put back on the night express to Beijing. It was dark before they came, and we had to do the stern questioning and the confession by candlelight. When I finally left, the peasant crowd was still milling restlessly outside under the stars, 

<p>The villagers' silent protest reflected the deep hostility felt by many rural Chinese towards the cadres who so often bully and over-tax them. They did not know whether I had broken the law or not, but they were on my side. 

<p>Yet the lesson is not that China is ruled by a totalitarian machine with an all-powerful grip. If I had not lingered in the village too long and been caught by the local cop, no one in Beijing would have complained about the story that I wrote afterwards. Chinese bureaucrats usually do not want to be bothered - and many believe the rules are outdated anyhow. One young official with the job of monitoring what the British press writes about China regularly tones down his summaries: "There's no point in upsetting some old guy among the top leaders," he explains. 

<p>A quarter of a century after Mao Zedong died (and since I began to report regularly from China) the country is still in a process of uneven transition where the reality is often not what it seems. Trying to understand this is made harder by the wooden propaganda in which the Communist party is always "great, glorious and correct". It is equally complicated by the crude stereotypes - often dating back to the cold war - that still mould many western perceptions of China. 

<p>Too often the complexities of life in China are reduced to what I came to call, during my last five years' reporting from Hong Kong and Shanghai, the "babies-in-ditch" cliche. Yes, babies, especially unwanted female ones, do get abandoned: they also get sold. (The village where I was arrested was a baby-selling center: the story had already been exposed in the Chinese press.) Yet babies also get rescued from ditches and from the dealers, by passers-by and by dedicated welfare officials and police. Many of them get adopted too - often by couples who "want a girl". In a village outside Beijing, disabled children from a city orphanage were fostered by rich farming families who did not really need the modest subsidy they gained. Once the kids reached 16, they were supposed to go back to the city, but the house mothers had a different idea. "They've become part of the family now: we can't let them go!" 

<p>The foreign media exposes - rightly - the plight of the millions of Chinese workers laid off with miserable benefits from failing state-owned industries. Yet for years western diplomatic sources, quoted by the same media, have insisted that China's readiness to dismantle its "unprofitable" state industrial sector is a key test of its "commitment to reform". We have drawn attention - correctly - to the pitiful state of China's rural medical services which would be quite unable to cope if the Sars virus spread deep into the countryside. Yet when China took the quasi-capitalist road under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, there was widespread applause for its wholesale rejection of the socialist values of the past - including the rural "barefoot doctors" whose absence is now deplored. 

<p>In judging Chinese foreign policy too, Beijing's "rationality" is too often measured by a partisan pro-US yardstick. In 1999 it was accused of stirring up xenophobia when many Chinese objected loudly to the American bombing of their embassy in Belgrade. Their genuine anger at the US spy-plane episode in April 2001 was also said to have been orchestrated. The real surprise should have been the speed with which Beijing patched up the dispute with a new US administration that had already sounded an unfriendly note towards China. 

<p>On the night of September 11, China was accused of reacting callously because the state TV did not carry live coverage from New York (though several provincial stations that I watched in Shanghai pirated CNN to do so). The reality was that China joined the US-led "war on terror" very quickly, and has kept its criticism of the Iraq war strictly muted. In Beijing I witnessed recently how the only Chinese demonstration against the war was squelched by police, while a march by foreign residents was tolerated for just 20 minutes. 

<p>China's missile deployment and its formal refusal to "renounce the use of force" are cited as a threat to Taiwan. Again, the real story should be Beijing's failure to do more than verbally denounce the pro-independence government. 

<p>Many Chinese who are critical of their own government still find western coverage unbalanced. "I object strongly to the persecution of the Falun Gong and other human rights abuses," says a graduate from an MBA program in the US, "but I simply did not recognize my country in the one-sided reporting there." Chinese officials tighten a vicious circle of misunderstanding further by blocking the kind of access that would give a more balanced picture. A foreign NGO working in Yunnan province on HIV-Aids tried for nearly a year without success to get permission for the Guardian to cover its project. "The irony is that the authorities there are doing really good work", said the project director. 

<p>I believe however that the speed of change in China is now so fast that within the next decade the stereotypes will be shattered - on both sides. 

<p>Many aspects of emerging capitalism in China are as raw and bloody - and as historically inevitable - as when Marx chronicled them 150 years ago in Europe. Western manufacturers (and consumers) benefit from the comparative advantage of cheap Chinese labor, while shaking their heads when another sweatshop with barred windows catches fire and a dozen more workers die. Yet the migration of between 70 million and 100 million migrant workers to the cities will create a reverse flow of social awareness transforming rural life. Many young rural women are already less willing to accept the male domination of family elders. 

<p>We frown on the ugly glossiness of the new urban China, with its extremely rich who build replicas of the White House on their estates and squander millions in the casinos of Asia. More significant in coming years will be the growth of a better-educated middle class with more modest aims and a much greater social identity. 

<p>Foreign China specialists are wary of making predictions about the future -we have often been wrong in the past - leaving the field to a small number of doomsday forecasts about the "collapse of China". Certainly the Communist party is still moving too slowly and its brutish instruments of repression remain mostly unaccountable. Yet a series of shocks, from the 1998 floods to this year's Sars crisis, have already forced the leadership to show more concern for the rich-poor gap, the deprived inner provinces and the environment. 

<p>I believe that younger forces in the party and outside will prevail and that China has a better chance of making a peaceful transition. The determined young journalists whom I got to know and the cheerful students my wife taught offer the best hope for the future.
