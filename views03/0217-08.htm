<p>On Saturday (Feb. 15), we stood on the Capitol steps in Austin, Texas --
across the street from the governor's mansion where George W. Bush once 
lived -- and spoke to 10,000 Texans who had gathered to reject Bush's mad 
rush to war in Iraq.

<p>The next morning we watched National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice 
explain on a talk show why the views of those 10,000 people -- and hundreds 
of thousands more across the United States, and millions more around the
world who rallied and marched against a war -- don't really matter.

<p>At first glance Rice seems right; increasingly public opinion has little to 
do with public policy, which is probably why Americans feel so alienated
from politics.

<p>In the past decade, the institutions that govern our lives have grown more 
unaccountable and remote. Take a crucial issue such as corporate power. 
Public outrage over Enron and similar scandals has been wide and deep. On 
the eve of the 2000 election, a Business Week survey showed that nearly 
three-quarters of Americans said business has gained too much power over
too many aspects of their lives. The public would like to see corporate 
power curbed, yet politicians -- Republicans and Democrats -- take no 
serious action.

<p>Of all the public policy issues, none seems as remote and beyond citizen
influence as foreign policy. Even though opposition to U.S. wars persisted 
throughout the 1990s, organized protest dwindled as people begin to feel
powerless.

<p>In the past six months that trend has dramatically reversed, for several
reasons.

<p>First, after Sept. 11, 2001, everyone sees that foreign policy directly 
affects us at home; there is no denying that U.S. actions in the Middle 
East have helped fertilize the soil in which terrorism grows. People 
realize it is a mistake to leave such issues to foreign-policy "experts."

<p>Second, people understand that the Bush administration is manufacturing 
pretexts for war and that there is no credible threat; none of Iraq's 
neighbors (with the exception of Israel, whose leaders favor a U.S. war on 
Iraq for their own interests) fears an Iraqi attack. The Hussein regime is 
brutal (which is not exactly news to the American officials who once 
supported Hussein), but few people believe that Bush is telling the truth 
about U.S. motivations. When administration officials claim a war has 
nothing to do with U.S. desires to maintain and extend its global hegemony 
-- including greater control over the flow of oil and oil profits -- people 
around the world simply laugh.

<p>And, perhaps most importantly, people are beginning to believe once again 
that they can change things.

<p>In public, Rice and other administration officials appear to pay little 
heed to opposition. They want to undermine people's sense of their own 
power, instill a sense of futility and convince us of the inevitability of 
war. But in private, they no doubt are paying attention -- and are nervous.

<p>The same has been true in the past. In 1969, President Richard Nixon had a 
secret plan called "Duck Hook" to escalate dramatically the attack on 
Vietnam, including the possible use of nuclear weapons. Nixon officials 
planned to issue an ultimatum to North Vietnam on Nov. 1, 1969.

<p>On Oct. 15, across the country millions took part in local demonstrations, 
  church services and vigils as part of Vietnam Moratorium Day. Another major 
demonstration was in the works for the following month. Although the public 
would not know until years later, that opposition was a main reason Nixon 
canceled Duck Hook.

<p>The Bush administration, as the Nixon administration before it, wants 
desperately to ignore the rising tide of worldwide and domestic opposition 
to this war. But the more we begin to believe in our own power and act on 
that belief, the harder it will be to ignore us.

<p>That is why -- even as Bush officials work desperately to block diplomatic 
solutions -- all who reject the administration's militarism and plans for 
empire must speak louder and press harder. That commitment by people of 
conscience -- people who believe in their own power -- has changed history 
in the past. Our commitment today can do the same.
