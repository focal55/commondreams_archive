<p>On March 15 I was one of 19 engaging in civil disobedience near Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora to register opposition to war with Iraq. 

<p>I believed our government had been less than candid about its "evidence." I doubted that weapons of mass destruction existed or that Saddam would be easily dispatched. 

<p>A simplistic reaction to 9-11 had precluded the administration's formulating a viable foreign policy, and I suspected Iraqis wouldn't welcome an occupation. I feared for servicemen and women treated as expendable, many of whom return — if they return — maimed, ill and all-too-often demoralized (see former Marine Anthony Swoford's "Jarhead" and Chris Hedges' "War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning"). And after the 1994 LIFE article on American servicemen from the Gulf war who'd had children with birth defects that matched those of Iraqi children — and the documentary "Invisible War: Depleted Uranium and the Politics of Radiation" — I dreaded our troops' being forced again to contaminate themselves, Iraqis and the environment with this substance. 

<p>Civil disobedience has a venerable history. Our own American Thoreau went to jail for refusing to pay the poll tax because it funded slavery. Gandhi's high-profile use of this tactic set an example that was continued by the women's suffrage movement in Britain, African-Americans struggling for civil rights, opponents of the nuclear arms race and nuclear power industry, the sanctuary and divestment campaigns of the '80s, South Africa's anti-apartheid movement and ACT UP — to name a few. 

<p>"I must see that I do not lend myself to the wrong I condemn," Thoreau wrote in "Civil Disobedience" in 1849. And as for "the ways which the state has provided for remedying the evil, they take too much time, and a man's life will be gone." Like Thoreau, we decided that "if the injustice ... is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then ... break the law. Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine." 

<p>Representatives from the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center met with Aurora police well before our action. Together with the police, they clarified the details: how many of us, where, when, how, what the charges would be. The police knew that we'd act nonviolently. We in turn understood that they would perform their duties of keeping the peace and carrying out our arrests. Then what we'd imagined as cooperation on the part of the police turned into deception. We learned later that only 18 of us had acted in good faith. The nineteenth "demonstrator" was a police informer. She'd infiltrated our planning meeting; asked one of us at the time of the action to read her statement for her; pretended to be arrested; and waited with us to be booked. 

<p>Planting an informer in our midst would be laughable if it weren't at the expense of the taxpayers. Funds used to pay the informer were wasted, since she learned nothing we hadn't told the police ourselves. And she made no written report — because there was nothing more to say. 

<p>Much of what I feared has come to pass. Saddam is unaccounted for. Sunni and Shiite hostility mounts. No weapons of mass destruction have surfaced. Iraqis are desperate for work and for their own government, and another dose of depleted uranium will live on in the bodies of children not yet born. The war appears to have been futile, save for those in the political-corporate lobby who'll profit from Iraqi oil. 

<p>Those who enact civil disobedience have to be willing to engage the legal system. We pleaded not guilty to get jury trials, hoping to make our case against the war on the stand. But in pretrial hearings the judge has ruled that we couldn't invoke the precedents establishing that not only governments but individuals must uphold international law. Nor may we cite the presence of the informer as part of our defense. 

<p>Under these conditions, we'll get a hearing only if citizens inform themselves about the duties of jurists. Jurors have the power to decide cases not on narrowly circumscribed charges as defined by the judge (i.e., whether or not we blocked a street for 15 minutes) but on the basis of issues the jurors themselves feel are relevant. 

<p>Jurors have this power; but it's the custom that judges do not inform jurors of this power. Jurors themselves have to know that, as our patriot forefather John Adams said in 1771, "It is not the juror's right but his duty to find the verdict according to his own ... judgment and conscience, though in direct opposition to the instruction of the court." Search the Internet for jury nullification to learn more about this citizen power. If potential jurors inform themselves, our trials just might become a truly open and public examination of the war we opposed.
