<p>Ship me off to Guantanamo: I've become a rogue
person filled with misconceptions, negativity, and
anger.  This is not the America I want.  This is not
the America I expected.  Based on the standards of
this America, I'm the enemy.
<p>I know I only have myself to blame for my illusions
and for the path I've taken, yet surely the
misinformation I learned as a youth extenuates
circumstances.  Misunderstandings about our Founding
Fathers clearly added a great deal to my confusion
about the real meaning of America.  
<p>I was thoroughly convinced our founders really
wanted to identify our nation with liberty, equality,
truth, justice, civil rights, humanity, dignity,
integrity, progressiveness, and freedom.  I actually
thought America was supposed to represent the highest
ideals and standards of democracy to the world.
<p>I admit it now: I was wrong.
<p>President Bush, however, truly understands the
American way.  He knows exactly what will be exported
to the Middle East in the name of democracy.   
<p>Apparently, I don't understand America.  I don't
understand running the government as a business.  I
don't understand restricting civil rights,
information, and social safety nets in order to enrich
the already rich and to strengthen the already strong military-industrial complex.  I don't understand placing the interests of business and property ahead of those of people.  I don't understand not cooperating with other nations in protecting the world from nuclear proliferation, global warming, land mines, and war crimes.  I don't understand an Environmental Protection Agency that contradicts its own name.
<p>I just don't get it.  
<p>I must have gotten the notions about not
participating in wars of aggression and not meddling
in the internal affairs of other nations from Star
Trek's prime directive or some such place, not from
our Founding Fathers.  I must have erroneously
attributed a lot of ideals and values to our founders
and to America from concepts derived from television,
movies, folklore and elsewhere.
<p>Popular culture can really play tricks.  
<p>History indicates our Founding Fathers
predominantly intended to represent the interests of
business and the land's wealthiest individuals, not
those of average people.  They chose much of their
lofty language in order to attract more soldiers from
the poorer classes for the revolution.  They designed
our government to exclude Native Americans, slaves, non-landowners, and women from voting and other rights.  
<p>It was Star Trek that envisioned a future when all
people would unite and work harmoniously together,
form an egalitarian federation, and strive for
compassion, understanding, and human betterment - not
our Founding Fathers.  It was Star Trek that
considered societies dominated by the desire for
monetary gain and conquest to be primitive.
<p>I must sort out my thinking.  
<p>When terrorists crashed planes into the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon President Bush accurately
stated they had attacked symbols of democracy and
liberty.  I mistakenly thought they had attacked
symbols of capitalism and militarism.  
<p>Invading Iraq was actually nothing new.  America
has fought many unprovoked preemptive wars against
practically defenseless opponents.  America has
supported many unjust causes and has committed
countless atrocities inside and outside our borders. 
America has long been about exclusion, not inclusion; capitalism, not human rights.  
<p>I've just been stubbornly clinging to a mistaken
definition of America.  
<p>Many appear to agree with President Bush's
definition.  These are America's positive thinkers. 
They are for things: for our president, for whatever
he wants, for war, for tax cuts, for big business, for
money.  They unselfishly sacrifice their own best
interests to those of big business and America's most
wealthy.  These people side with winners.
<p>They don't let facts erode their beliefs or become
bogged down worrying about actual Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction, international laws, collateral
damage, or environmental destruction.  They know
humankind can adapt to any new world order or ecology.
<p>They are America's true patriots.  They understand
this America.  They understand that when Mr. Bush
talks about democracy, he's talking about capitalism;
when he talks about liberty, he's talking about
military force.  They get it.  
<p>Then there are those like me who are down on this
America: the negative thinkers.  They are anti-war,
anti-media consolidation, anti-mountaintop mining, anti-clear-cutting, anti-pollution, anti-government surveillance, anti-privatization, anti-exploitation, anti-economic inequity, anti-social inequality, anti-this, and anti-that.  These unfortunates are not happy people.  
<p>This negative bunch should be sent away along with
me to Guantanamo without due process for refusing to
accept the true definition of America and for thinking
they can choose the America they want.
<p>Maybe we'll even be able to create a better America
there inside our cages.
