<p>I wanted to title this July 4th column “Goin’ to Graceland.” Elvis Presley, an American icon, would be a fitting subject for an essay on America’s birthday. But we didn’t get there. Driving to a convention in Nashville, Tennessee, Arlene and I had planned to spend a few extra days in  Memphis to see Graceland and also the studio of Sun Records where Elvis, B.B. King, Howlin’ Wolf, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins made their first records. We then planned to loop south to visit the Museum of the Delta Blues in Clarksdale, Mississippi. We didn’t get there either. 



 



<p>A few hours out of Vermont we decided that driving on the Interstate was no way to see America. So we went south, cutting through the parallel ridges of Pennsylvania, camped in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, and then wound our way through the narrow hills and hollows of Eastern Kentucky.



 



<p>One has to get off the beaten track to see small town, rural America. Everywhere we drove on an interstate or highway, we saw the same stores, the same logos, the same mini-marts, the same fast food franchises, the same motels, the same everything. 



 



<p>During the Civil War, Jeb Stuart burned Chambersburg, Pennsylvania to the ground, but the locals rebuilt it.  Today the Main Street is an architectural gem. But it’s deserted: without people, shops, businesses, or places to eat. Wal-Mart, Home Depot, nearby malls, and other big-box stores have succeeded where the Confederate cavalry failed. They have effectually sacked the downtown heart of America’s small towns and cities. 



 



<p>I was looking forward to returning to Eastern Kentucky. I had been there in the early 1960s helping to research a wildcat coal miner strike. We hadn’t been in the city of Hazard more than fifteen minutes when the chief of police hauled us in to the station, pulled out a copy of the Village Voice and asked us if we read this “commie paper.” Eastern Kentucky, then, was isolated and suspicious. When the police saw a stranger, they wanted to know “which side are you on?” 



 



<p>There’s a new courthouse under construction in Hazard, but the Main Street there, too, is deserted. Eastern Kentucky, in the 1960s, was one of the poorest and most remote parts of the country. It’s still poor, but now, thanks to government programs, it has parks, schools, new roads and highways – and strip development. People eat at the same restaurants and shop in the same stores in Hazard, Kentucky as they do everywhere else in the country. 



 



<p>America has become a homogeneous community of consumers. A plastic credit card is the passport to citizenship. There’s something positive to be said about the democracy of the dollar. Overt hostility over racial, ethnic, and religious differences has greatly diminished. (Gay couples, however, still may find travel difficult in many parts of America. The homophobia coming out of talk-radio is fearsome).  



 



<p>Bemoaning the loss of regionalism and downtown community life is more than nostalgia. It’s a loss for our country, a warning sign for the future. During the early days of the Iraqi War, the press quoted a young G.I. to the effect that the Iraqis had no malls, no shopping centers, no familiar fast food outlets, hence no civilization. This was just one young soldier trained for battle rather than for cultural sensitivity or an appreciation of history. The arrogance of his ignorance can be excused. But as we lose our regional peculiarities and other cultural differences, as we lose the experience of living among people with different tastes in foods, clothes, customs and culture, we risk becoming like that young soldier – unable to appreciate and respect the distinctiveness of different people and other societies. And for a country bent on maintaining global influence, that’s dangerous. 



 



<p>I’m not disappointed in missing Graceland.  The Mecca of American pop idolatry, it’s where Elvis ate and drugged himself to death, creatively and actually. Elvis made great records for Sun and, in the late 1950s, for RCA Victor. (For an example of the rawest, greatest and most authentic Elvis, visit www.sunstudio.com). He was the white singer who sang black and, given the racism of the time, it’s no wonder the morality police were in an uproar. To see videos or listen to records of Elvis in his prime is to witness a cultural earthquake, society being changed. Then the corporate suits took control of his career, steered him away from country music and the blues, sent him to Hollywood, and toned down his act. They homogenized him, corporatized him, packaged him, and made him wealthy enough to buy his Graceland mansion where boredom rotted his soul.  Elvis’ tragedy, the tragedy of creativity killed, is a lesson for all America. 



 



<p>In Nashville, the Grand Ole Opry is now located in a country music mall. But in a downtown honky-tonk, a no-name cover band of musicians in their twenties launched into a Hank Williams tune. Hank Williams, another white singer influenced by black blues, was the poet laureate of male vulnerability to lost dreams and hopeless love. He very rarely wrote a happy song, but when he did, when he broke through the pain of his life in what Tom Jefferson referred to as “the pursuit of happiness,” his joy was contagious. 



 



<p>“Hey, good lookin’! Whatchya got cookin?”.



 



<p>The old white-haired couple at the next table started singing along with the band, and we did too. They were in Graceland. We were in Graceland. Graceland is not a mansion or a theme park or a big-box mall. It’s a creative spirit, molten energy, a mixing of cultures, a melding of bodies, a meshing of dreams, of songs of hope, and yearning hearts.  



 



<p>That which made America special and great is not for sale at a franchised shopping center or the mall.
