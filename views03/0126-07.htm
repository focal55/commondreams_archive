<p><i>The Man, the Armed Man! <br>
The Armed Man must be feared! <br>
Everyone says each one should arm himself with a hauberk made of iron. <br>
The Armed Man must be feared! <br>
</i>-- 15th century popular song, "L’homme armé"  (freely translated)
<p>There were a lot of armed men to fear in Renaissance Europe. People of all classes carried swords or daggers, and no one was safe from armed thugs seizing property, money or persons, or enforcing parochial customs or religious beliefs. There was hunger, poverty, illiteracy, rape, looting and killing, outbreaks of plague, as well as torture and public executions by burning, hanging or disembowelment for heresy and political incorrectness. William Tyndale (1492-1536) was burnt at the stake for translating the Bible into English, and Henry VIII (1491-1547) beheaded two inconvenient wives. 
<p>The song "L’homme armé" sounds almost barbarous nowadays, and the masses based on it seem only a little less bleak. Yet by the 16th century feudal barbarism was already beginning to be tamed by wealthy merchants and powerful nobles who financed literacy, learning, science, and the arts. After another 300 years an alternative to governance by fear and force was developed. The U.S. Constitution created a society based on shared values of equality, freedom and civil liberties for all (at least in principle) and provided a framework for sharing responsibilities and benefits "...to insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense ...."
<p>To achieve almost anything, humans make plans, a process that entails thinking about what we want the future to be like and how to make it so. Families and tribes share futures, and must reconcile differing individual values and goals, and find means to share the benefits and responsibilities of their plans. Today the challenge of globalization is that everyone on earth shares the same future, and planning is enormously complex. Unless we want a future governed by fear and power, we have to agree on basic shared values and develop policies and processes for allocating benefits and responsibilities fairly 
<p>Fear is still powerful in the world. Most nations keep armed forces who are expected to internalize the public fear and kill professionally to remove threats. Some societies also invest enormous resources in weapons for killing with efficiency, scope and precision. 
<p>Americans, insulated by oceans, wealth, self-satisfaction, and huge military budgets, are unaccustomed to fear and naive about its power. We remain more bewildered than frightened by the wanton attack on American civilians on September 11, 2001. Most of us don’t feel personally threatened, though we would like to be safe from further attacks and have the perpetrators brought to justice.
<p>But in our bewilderment, we risk letting fear overcome our responsibility to stand up for our values. We risk becoming terrorists ourselves, letting the ends justify the means and using fear and force against anyone we appoint as enemy.
<p>We must never forget that civil liberties, including the right of due process, freedom of speech, press, religion, and free and fair elections are not optional perks of Americanism, but the very stuff of democracy, the system that keeps us sharing our values, benefits and responsibilities with our neighbors.
<p>Do I fear armed men -- terrorists armed with planes with full fuel tanks, or zealots armed with plastic bags of anthrax spores? Of course. But even more I fear powerful men armed with secret tribunals and a "USA Patriot Act". I fear a Congress that spends billions on weapons and skimps on funding for education and health. I fear a mass media that treats us like gullible, irresponsible, not-very-bright children. I fear rich merchants and political nobles who invest in oil, weapons and power instead of literacy, learning, science, and the arts. Most of all I fear a President who assumes the power to make war and decide for the world who should die -- when, where, and for what cause. 
<p>Listen carefully to President Bush’s State of the Union speech. Is he planning your future, the future of your nation, the future of your planet -- according to values you share? Is he planning benefits for his friends and the responsibility of paying the bills for the rest of us?  Is he planning to enrich the American economy by impoverishing the rest of the world?  Is he planning a fine heroic war and a second term as president for himself and death for our children in arms, and for any children in Iraq?

<p>Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. The absolute power to make absolute war corrupts absolutely. Be afraid, be very afraid, when someone armed with the largest arsenal of the most deadly weapons on earth plans to remake the world to his specifications.

<p>In the 16th century wearing a hauberk (chain-mail protecting neck and shoulders) was probably prudent. Metaphorically, it was a way of not sticking your neck out, though it must have had serious drawbacks.

<p>But hauberks are not a solution for us. Americans must stick their necks out or there will be no defense against government by armed men in Washington. Each and every one of us, stakeholders in the future of democracy, must assume responsibility for disarming and rendering harmless those armed men who threaten us, and all our children, with death and destruction.

<p><i>L'homme armé doibt on doubter!</i></p>
