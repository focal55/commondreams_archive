<p>Each day I log on to my progressive news sites perform my daily 
reading.  There's GNN, Alternet, Common Dreams, and when I'm feeling 
less completely subjective - Salon.  What I've seen a lot of recently 
is a troubling trend amongst progressive writers.  While the country 
seems deeply split on a macro level between issues of Liberal and 
Conservative, the progressive movement is also evenly split between 
Liberal and More Liberal.  Or Dean and Kucinich.  Though I normally 
welcome this healthy debate, our democracy is not healthy today.  We 
are being led by a President that is universally regarded around the 
world and by many in this country as the most dangerous leader we have 
ever had.  Therefore, consider the following a call for unity.

<p>The mainstream press has given Howard Dean the mixed blessing of 
magazine covers with headlines like "Destiny or Disaster?", the 
progressive press seems to be engaging in the same public thought 
process.  Perhaps this was best marked by two articles recently, one 

titled "The Progressive Case for Howard Dean" while the other responded 
"A Progressive Case for Dean? Not Yet, Kucinich is Still Our Man."

<p>Whether it's Newsweek or Guerrilla News, the message is clear:  "Once 
the progressives learn who Howard Dean really is they will run from him 
faster than Dick Cheney fleeing to his 'undisclosed location.'"

<p>Truth be told, I'm still waiting for a minority radical feminist who 
puts renewable energy above everything else and guts the military 
budget to invest in renewable state-of-the-art public schools 
(including free college education).  But you know what?  I'll be 
waiting a little while longer.  While I could write articles saying 
Dennis Kucinich isn't my dream candidate - "After all, one need not 
point out that our candidate of hope is not EVEN a minority radical 
feminist." - while I could do this, I don't.  And why?  Because today 
there is a bigger fight to be fought.

<p>Two years ago, France faced a similar crisis.  An unpopular Prime 
Minister led to a record low Primary election voter turnout of 73%.  
Can anyone imagine an 73% voter turnout here.  It would be like nothing 
we've ever seen in our lifetime.  A triumph.  In France, it was 
catastrophe.  Not just because it showed a real civil detachment from 
the political process, but also because this weakness was seized upon 
by Jean-Marie LePen.  LePen was a fascist in the truest sense of the 
word.  I know we all get fired up and call Bush a fascist, but really, 
this guy was a self-described fascist.  He meant every word of it.  
With his election success, France now faced a tough decision.  
Apathetic voter turnout allowed the country's favorite candidate, 
Jospin, to lose in the Primary.  France now faced a general election 
between the hated Jean-Marie LePen and the also hated (though now that 
word was put into new context) Jacque Chirac.

<p>What did the French do?  Did they publish article after article 
exposing all the positions where their Socialist party leader just 
wasn't socialist enough?  No.  They rolled up their sleeves and fought 
the good fight.  They knew that if they tried to run an independent 
candidate they would lose the country to a Fascist who's fondness 
towards blaming foreigners for poisoning the country's economy sounded 
a little too familiar to that of another Fascist that visited their 
country only 50 years ago.  No, with this election it was time to 
swallow pride and put aside political differences to save the country.  
European TV all over the continent showed coverage on election day of 
the French, in a moment of great national humor, casting their ballot 
for Chirac and then stepping forward into a shower to cleanse 
themselves.  And guess what?  Chirac won.  Was it a triumph for French 
politics?  Absolutely not.  I think the French will be the first to 
tell you though, that sometimes averting a political disaster is 
triumph enough.

<p>Can you accurately imagine the disaster of Dubya having four years to 
operate without fear of reelection.  He could do virtually anything he 
wanted.  Heck, he could create laws that allow him to spy on all of us 
without any probable cause.  He could lock up thousands of people 
without charging them and deny them access to a lawyer.  He could make 
deals with his business cronies to open up our national parks to a 
buffet of abuses.  He could invade other countries and steal their 
resources.  Oh wait, that's his first term.

<p>And that's my point.  I don't think any one of us could have imagined 
this first term.  Now, from that starting point, imagine the next four. 
  It should keep you up at night.

<p>In reality, from the mainstream viewpoint a win by Howard Dean in the 
general election would herald a new era in American politics.  It would 
seem that America was operating, overall, on a liberal foundation.  
After all the statements to the contrary, constituents wanted MORE 
progressive candidates and not more centrist candidates.  Right wing 
radio wouldn't know how to spin it.  Politicians would throw out their 
old playbook and start over.  And that's where the progressive movement 
can really be effective.

<p>Do I love Kucinich despite the fact that he's not a minority radical 
feminist?  Yes.  Does he look like he's going to win the general 
election, let alone the Primary elections?  I don't think so.  We 
should really take our cue this time from France.  Election cycles are 
not about enacting 180 degree radical political shift.  Change takes 
time.  The Republicans didn't take over in one election.  George Bush 
is not the 1960s republican.  Even Nader frequently laments that he's 
nostalgic for conservatives like Nixon.  George Bush represents a 
gradual takeover (albeit one that was accelerated by illegal voter 
fraud in Florida).

<p>The key is to unite.  In its most crude terms, the Democratic wing of 
the Democratic party can be broken down into two camps:  The Deans and 
The Kucinichs.  Can we all please unite around one of them?  I am more 
than willing to throw full support behind Kucinich if he were setting 
the record for fundraising, grassroots turnout, and media coverage.  
All I ask is the same from you because right now that person is Howard 
Dean.
