<p>War looms. Troops are moving into place. Administration 
officials 
refuse to discuss alternatives. And everyday George W. Bush 
has 
some new rhetorical device to turn up the heat. The game is 
over. 
The game is <i> really</i> over. I mean it: the game is <i> 
really, really</i> over.  Americans opposed to (or skeptical 
about) this war are desperately trying to mount preemptive 
protests, as conquest--bombing, invasion and 
occupation--nears. 
Antiwar actions have been organized for the weekend of 
February 15 
and 16, to coincide with protests around the world. In the 
United 
States, the main events will be demonstrations held in New 
York 
and San Francisco. This could be the last chance the antiwar 
warriors have before the cruise missiles fly. Yet the 
peaceniks 
pulling together the San Francisco march and rally may have 
tainted their efforts by allowing the banning of Rabbi Michael 
Lerner as a speaker.</p>

</table></font></font></font>Lerner is <i> the</i> progressive Jew. He edits <i> 
<a href="http://www.tikkun.org/" target="_new">Tikkun</a></i>, a 
magazine mostly written by lefty Jews. (Its name is Hebrew 
for "to 
mend, repair and transform the world.") He can be counted 
on to 
sign on to most liberal causes. He is a signatory to the Not In 
Our Name antiwar pledge. His Tikkun Community is a 
member of the 
<a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">United for Peace & Justice coalition</a> that opposes a U.S. war 
against Iraq. (Other members include the American Friends 
Service 
Committee, Global Exchange, Greenpeace, TransAfrica, 
Working 
Assets.) He has been a leading Jewish voice against the 
hawks of 
Israel and a supporter of Palestinian rights, while calling 
himself a Zionist. 
</p>
<p>
So it was natural that his name was floated as a speaker for 
the 
protest. Not In Our Name and United for Peace & Justice 
were two 
of the four coalitions behind the event. (According to Lerner, 
he 
did not ask to address the San Francisco rally. "You can't say 
much in three minutes," he notes.) But International 
ANSWER, 
another of the organizers, said no. 
</p>

<p>
Lerner's crime: he had dared to criticize ANSWER, an outfit 
run by 
members of the Workers World Party, for using antiwar 
demonstrations to put forward what he considers to be 
anti-Israel 
propaganda. That ANSWER objected to Lerner is not 
surprising. The 
WWPers in control of ANSWER are socialists who call for the 
revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, who support Slobodan 
Milosevic and Kim Jong Il, who oppose UN inspections in 
Iraq 
(claiming they are part of the planning for an invasion aimed 
at 
gaining control of Iraq's oil fields), and who urge smashing 
Zionism. Last month, referring to an upcoming ANSWER 
demonstration, Lerner wrote, "In my view, the organizers of 
this 
demonstration have allowed far too many speakers who 
believe that 
this war is being done because Israel wants the war, far too 
few 
who share my view that this war is not in the best interests of 
either Israel or of the United States." Yet Lerner didn't let his 
differences with ANSWER trump his opposition to the war; he 
encouraged people to attend the rally. After that protest, he 
told 
<i> The New York Times</i>, "There are good reasons to 
oppose the 
war and Saddam. Still, it feels that we are being manipulated 
when 
subjected to mindless speeches and slogans whose 
knee-jerk 
anti-imperialism rarely articulates the deep reasons we 
should 
oppose corporate globalization."
</p>
<p>
ANSWER's <i> nyet</i> doesn't irk Lerner as much as the 
fact that 
Not In Our Name and United for Peace & Justice didn't 
oppose it. 
Before 
Lerner had been suggested as a speaker, the coalitions 
engineering 
the San Francisco event had agreed that any individual who 
had 
publicly disparaged one of the organizing groups could be 
vetoed 
as a speaker by that group. ANSWER used this right to 
banish 
Lerner. (The rabbi maintains he had no intention of using his 
podium time to slam ANSWER: "Why waste my three 
minutes on 
ANSWER?") Other organizers of the San Francisco event 
argued 
against ANSWER's thumbs-down but ended up abiding by 
the 
agreement. (ANSWER has not been involved in the 
organizing of the 
coming New York City protest.)
</p>
<p>
ANSWER could cite Lerner's criticism of ANSWER as a 
reason for 
blocking him. But its objection to Lerner also jibes with the 
group's political agenda. On January 28, Tony Murphy, the 
media 
coordinator for ANSWER, appeared on a radio show in New 
York and 
said, "I know that the ANSWER coalition would not have a 
pro-Israel speaker on its platform." (Lerner is pro-Israel in 
that 
he supports the existence of the Jewish state.) ANSWER's 
anti-Israel stance has also been reflected in its relationship 
with at least one troubling anti-Zionist. At its January march in 
Washington, ANSWER handed a microphone to Abdul Malim 
Musa, a 
Muslim cleric. On October 31, 2001, Musa had appeared at a 
news 
conference at the National Press Club with other Muslim 
activists 
and members of the New Black Panther Party, where 
speakers 
asserted that Israel had launched the 9/11 attacks and that 
thousands of Jews had been warned that day not to go to 
work at 
the World Trade Center. At that press conference, Musa 
blasted the 
"Zionists in Hollywood, the Zionists in New York, and the 
Zionists 
in D.C." who "all collaborate" to put down blacks and 
Muslims. 
ANSWER has room in its antiwar coalition for Musa, but not 
Lerner.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, Lerner disseminated an email reporting he had 
been 
banned. And Beyt Tikkun synagogue, where Lerner serves 
as a rabbi, 
released a statement saying, "we do not believe that had 
ANSWER 
been criticized by a major feminist or gay leader and then 
vetoed 
that leader to speak at a demonstration that the other 
coalition 
partners would go along with that. So why should criticism of 
anti-Semitism and Israel-bashing be treated differently?....So 
why 
should our voice of critique of ANSWER's anti-Israel policy 
serve 
as justification for excluding our rabbi from speaking?" 
</p>
<p>
ANSWER did not return my call seeking comment. Which 
isn't a 
shock. I've written critically about their role in the antiwar 
movement, and their folks, in return, have assailed me. I also 
tried reaching Andrea Buffa, the San Francisco-based 
co-chair of 
United for Peace & Justice, and didn't hear back. Bert Knorr, 
an organizer in the 
San Francisco office of Not In Our Name, says, "We're 
concerned with what happened and hope it can be amicably 
resolved." On Monday 
evening, 
organizers of the rally tried to "resolve" the matter, 
according to one source. But Lerner was not offered a 
speaker's 
slot. Instead, he says, he has been asked by the organizers 
to 
talk about all this <i> after</i> the event. In the meantime, <i> 
The Wall Street 
Journal</i> and 
National Public Radio have interviewed Lerner about 
ANSWER's 
rejection of him and the other organizers' 
acceptance of that. And over 150 progressive writers and 
activists 
have signed a 
letter 
decrying the Lerner ban. (Click <a 
href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0211-09.
htm">here</a> to read the 
petition.)
</p>
<p>
"This is about the suppressing of dissent among the 
dissenters," 
Lerner asserts. "My progressive Jewish allies said, 'Don't 
raise 
this issue, it's more important to stick to the struggle against 
the war.' But in my view, we should be able to critique the war 
and this section of the antiwar movement, just as did the 
women 
who fought against sexism in the antiwar movement in the 
1960s. I 
don't accept an either/or."
</p>
<p>
Some peace activists in San Francisco were dismayed that 
Lerner 
took the dispute public. "What Michael did doesn't help," one 
says. But Lerner was more of a <i> mensch</i> than the 
people of 
ANSWER. Even after being blackballed, he has been 
advising people 
to attend the protest. "I don't want to boycott the 
demonstration," he says. "It's extremely important for 
progressive 
Jews to be standing up and critiquing the war, particularly 
when 
so many in the Jewish world are supporting it. We'll be part of 
the event, no matter what they do to me." 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps he should have stayed silent for the good of the 
cause. 
Who needs such <i> tsuris</i> right before an important 
protest? 
But Lerner was not the source of the problem; ANSWER was. 
This 
distracting episode shows what can happen when sincere 
do-gooders 
enter into deals with the ANSWER gang. If the reasonable 
and 
responsible foes of war are fortunate enough to have further 
opportunity to rally opposition to the conflict before it occurs, 
they ought to reconsider their alliance with the censors of 
ANSWER.</p><p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2003 The Nation</p>
