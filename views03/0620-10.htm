<p>How can we keep hope alive in times like these?  Do we even have any 
business trying?  A couple weeks back I heard that George W. and Laura Bush 
were visiting some old Nazi death camp or other.  Good, I thought.  Maybe it 
would turn out to be a life-changing experience for them as it was for me 
when in 1979 I visited Dachau. 

<p>At that time, the bus let you off outside a benign entrance...I mainly 
remember lots of vines.  Just inside, the first striking thing was what at 
first glance seemed to be an exaggeratedly huge, thick barbed wire enclosure. 
<p>A bit closer to this you would recognize, however, that it was in fact a 
sculpture with the 'wire' and 'barbs' actually the twists and angles of 
human bodies writhing in and out.  I've never encountered mention of this 
sculpture anywhere and wonder if it is still there.  I'd read an account by 
a nun who visited Dachau years later who decried the changes the museum had 
gone through in the '80's.  It had become more sanitized...much less 
disturbing a memorial apparently.  But wasn't "disturbing" the point, I 
thought?  Anyway, 24 years later, I can't forget that sculpture or the rooms 
of life size photos of inmates in their striped clothes...the effect of their 
collective black-and-white 'eye contact' full of hopes and fears was truly 
overwhelming. 

<p>There was a film they showed there every hour or so...similar to one I'd 
seen in 6th grade when I was bussed to a mostly Jewish school...the same 
film many of my generation has seen at some point; with corpses carted off 
to enormous holes by the truckload, unceremoniously dumped in, their naked, 
emaciated bodies flopping lifelessly into piles as uniformed officers looked 
on at this new routine no one could have anticipated 10 years prior.  Then 
the film shows people crying coming out from inside the 'ovens' and shots of 
skeletal survivors in a daze, not yet comprehending their release from their 
horror as troops arrive to liberate them from the camps.  When the film was 
over, no one spoke a word...how can one after something like that?  How can 
you do anything but walk around in a daze...wander outside for some air and 
greenery until you find yourself somehow standing before an enormously tall 
structure and notice that absolutely no one in this crowd is venturing toward 
it but you.  You can barely manage to stagger back away from there and down 
another, less hellish path to where prisoners slept, stacked in like level 
after level of chickens in a huge and crowded hen house...no room to turn 
around---just enough of a box to fit your adult frame in if you assume a 
fetal position.  All clean and empty now, it almost amplifies the cruelty of 
those times.  Visitors shake their heads in disbelief, shame, heartbreak, 
outrage. 

<p>Outside between these buildings was where groups would be lined up and shot. 
It's obvious by this time that no one ever ventures down that long path 
cutting across a huge field (a mass grave?) toward that building with the 
smokestacks.  I couldn't look at it.  Something about it affected my 
eyes...maybe all our eyes...like a negative magnet repels.  I can't claim to 
have gotten a very good look at it, though it was definitely THERE.  Not 
sure if it was a fear thing or a respect for the dead thing or a grief thing 
that made it so unapproachable and difficult to look at head on. 

<p>The friend I had gone there with was a fellow traveler from Australia.  We 
were too stunned to speak for hours it seemed.  I hope Mr. Bush got to feel 
that.  The first lady, too.  I hope it wakes something up in them both.  I 
hope they will visit other places; Guatemala near the Chixoy dam... 
Kandahar... Baghdad... Somalia.  I hope they will pay close attention to the 
ways stubborn adherence to ideologies of the powerful that rationalized 
violence could create such outcomes.  Perhaps then they could begin to grasp 
the huge difference between 'free trade' and 'fair trade'...maybe even 
develop an interest in sustainable agriculture or alternative energy 
sources. Maybe the Patriot Act and paramilitary security forces could be 
dismantled intelligently, thoughtfully and publicly.   Maybe George and 
Laura  would begin to relate to how Rachel Corrie could stand before that 
bulldozer refusing to believe it wasn't worth it.  Maybe then more of the 
world could believe our Commander in Chief when he used words like 
"humility" or "compassion" or "leaders of conscience".  Maybe there'd be 
less of a goose-step's swagger in his and his entourage's actions. 

<p>What would it take for such a change of heart, I wonder?  Do human beings 
evolve or mature according to some predetermined, genetic timetable?  Or can 
they grow and learn and cultivate a sense of interconnectedness... 
integrity... courage... kindness?  I keep remembering an article I cut out 
of the newspaper years ago and kept on the fridge about George Wallace... a 
much older, frail George Wallace in a wheelchair.  He was publicly asking 
forgiveness for his years of bigotry and racial hatred.  So.  There's your 
answer.  Truth and reconciliation can happen.  I hope our 'leaders of 
conscience' -in media, in politics, in business - can remember that and act 
accordingly.
