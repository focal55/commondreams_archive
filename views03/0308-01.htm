<p>PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC -- Nearly everyone reading this is about to become an 
                          accomplice to murder.</p>
                          <p>You are on the verge of launching a massive assault 
                          on Iraq, which will result in the deaths of thousands 
                          of innocent civilians and soldiers duty-bound to 
                          defend their land. Your massive aerial slaughter will 
                          be the denouement to a decade of silent genocide that, 
                          in the name of peace and security, has claimed the 
                          lives of hundreds of thousands of children. </p>
                          <p>Your invasion will be swift and brutal. You will 
                          rid the world of an ugly tyrant and probably put 
                          another in his place. It may lead to unimaginable 
                          consequences — revolution, terrorism, and war — across 
                          the Middle East and beyond. It will be a staggering 
                          blow to the rule of law and justice in international 
                          affairs.</p>
                          <p>Your invasion will be illegal and illogical, based 
                          on flimsy evidence and supported by childish, 
                          Orwellian propaganda. It is happening because untold 
                          billions will accrue to those who control the media 
                          you watch and the companies which suck your retirement 
                          funds dry: it is permitted because those who bear the 
                          costs are invisible people in a far-off land of which 
                          you know nothing. Iraq will be invaded not because it 
                          is a threat but because it is so weak it cannot even 
                          defend itself. People will not be liberated, but oil 
                          surely will.</p>
                          <p>All this will be done in your name, as you buy 
                          canned food and huddle in basements because of a 
                          conveniently-timed &quot;terror alert.&quot; Done in your name 
                          as an anti-war movement, it is studiously ignored by 
                          politicians and the media. </p>
                          <p>You have been duped by a gang of seedy, evil men 
                          who could not enumerate Wilson’s Fourteen Points 
                          without laughing, who plot war while kneeling in 
                          church, who can stage a photo op of a chickenhawk 
                          general in front of a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt 
                          without blushing. Men to whom the stench of corpses 
                          and the attendant profit is so much perfume. Men who 
                          can’t even be bothered to make their lies remotely 
                          credible when they stand in mockery before the world. 
                          You will send your sons and daughters to kill and be 
                          killed, while they wire profits to their offshore 
                          hedge funds. You will believe that it is all right and 
                          good and the American Way, and that is a repellent 
                          thought. </p>
                          <p>Václav Havel’s last act upon leaving the presidency 
                          of the Czech Republic was to sign a letter stating his 
                          support for the coming slaughter. I thought that of 
                          all nations, the Czechs would know what it means to 
                          stand helplessly at the sidelines as one’s country is 
                          offered as a sacrificial lamb to the ambitions of a 
                          stronger power. I thought that of all Europe’s 
                          leaders, Václav Havel would be the one to look at 
                          George Bush and recoil from the greedy violence, 
                          abysmal ignorance and the blind lust for power that 
                          now threatens the peace of the world. I thought that 
                          my adopted home would raise its voice, small and 
                          insignificant as it might be, against the thundering 
                          drums of war. </p>
                          <p>I was wrong to think these things, and that 
                          disappoints me bitterly. But that bitterness is 
                          nothing compared to what I feel when I watch Bush and 
                          Rumsfeld defecate proudly on the memory of that old 
                          home I still hold so dear. </p>
                          <p>The Bush administration feels no need to display 
                          objectivity or nuanced argumentation, so neither shall 
                          I. They have whored your honor and the memories of our 
                          greatest leader’s half-realized dreams, from Jefferson 
                          to Wilson to Martin Luther King. They have whored the 
                          memories of those who lie in silent tombs, from 
                          Normandy to New York, for a paltry 30 pieces of 
                          silver. In your hearts you know what they are doing, 
                          but you still let them get away with it. This is a 
                          shame that will not diminish over time, but grow and 
                          grow as the stench of needless death thickens 
                          inexorably. </p>
