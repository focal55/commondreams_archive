<p>No riot. None dead. That could have been the headline for the day after the verdict in the trial of police officer Jeremy Morse at the Airport courthouse in Los Angeles last week. 
<p>Morse was the officer who, in the course of an arrest in Inglewood last year, slammed a handcuffed black teenager, Donovan Jackson, face first on to the boot of a police car. Had not a bystander with a video camera captured the incident on film, nothing more would have been heard of it. But the film, which showed Jackson being hoisted up from a prone position by his handcuffs and smashed down like a piece of airport baggage, was shown across the country. 

<p>It reminded many people of the Rodney King case in 1991, when a black man had been beaten by white officers and the incident had been caught on camera. The white officers in that case were acquitted by an all-white jury, and the outrage sparked by that verdict led to the 1992 riots in LA in which 55 people died. 

<p>Much has changed in the past decade in both LA and the United States and there were a number of key differences in this case. In 1991, the chief of the LA police, the confrontational Daryl Gates, backed his officers. This time, the chief of police in Inglewood, the city in LA county where the latest incident took place, acted swiftly and sacked Morse. He also gave evidence against his own officer in court. The jury were clearly more thoughtful, only declaring that they were hopelessly split, with seven for a conviction and five against, after three days of deliberation: a hung jury and a possible retrial. A second officer, who was charged with filing a false report - essentially saying that he had seen nothing untoward - was acquitted. 

<p>But there were some similarities: Morse was defended by one of the lawyers who defended the King officers and the jury, with only one African-American, did not reflect the population of Inglewood, which is around 50% black. While the general feeling had been that this time there would be no riots even if the officer was not convicted, the authorities were taking no chances: all police in the LA area were on alert. 

<p>Down in Inglewood, just a few miles from the courthouse, there was a prayer vigil that evening to call for calm in the wake of the verdict. Many were angered that, with such clear evidence, there were no convictions. At the rally were the leaders of local churches, mosques and unions, the mayor and chief of police and even the young man, Mitchell Crooks, who shot the fateful video. There also was Dick Gregory, the comedian and veteran civil rights activist. 

<p>Gregory compared the peaceful, if angry, response in Inglewood to the recent behavior of the country's president. Mr Bush, he told the crowd, had employed 200 troops in a four-hour firefight to kill Saddam Hussein's sons and a 14-year-old boy, rather than try to carry out arrests and submit people for trial. In contrast, he said, the people of Inglewood had responded to their anger at the verdict peacefully and had eschewed the notion that violence is an acceptable tactic. 

<p>Gregory's presence was a reminder of the old civil rights movement and the example set by its leaders, many of whom, like Martin Luther King, were churchmen. The civil rights movement won many waverers through the dignity of its peaceful protest in the face of southern billy-clubs and guns. A new 37 cent stamp just issued in the US carries the face of Cesar Chavez, the late farmworkers' leader, who helped to organize exploited fruit-pickers by using the Gandhian example of non-violence. Both the meeting in Inglewood and the Chavez stamp are tributes to the concept of organized peaceful resistance to injustice. 

<p>The point that Dick Gregory was making was that the country is now being set an example by its president that violence is an acceptable political response. If you cannot be bothered to wait for resolution, use force. The death of a 14-year-old in the attack that killed the Hussein brothers has been barely noted. Were 200 US troops surrounding a building unable to bring out three men and a boy, asked Gregory. 

<p>Last week, President Bush, answering questions about gay marriage, noted obliquely that "we're all sinners". He and his administration have made much of their Christian faith yet they practice a buffet-style Christianity, picking and choosing the parts of the Bible (anything with the word "smite" in it) that they fancy and ignoring the parts they don't, like boring old "Thou shalt not kill" and references to rich men and eyes of needles. 

<p>In Inglewood, the Christians and Muslims who gathered and prayed and who walked the streets that night counseling peace, however angry people felt at the verdict, acted as an example of faith in action rather than in the empty words of politicians for whom religion is now more a cosmetic campaign accessory than a moral code. "No riot, none dead" may not attract much international attention, but it was a reminder of another side of America that is too often ignored.
