<p>Let me begin by assuring you that my rose-coloured glasses have been in storage for years, and I do not believe that international relations are driven by the purest of principles. However, the sheer intensity of Washington's "good versus evil" rhetoric invites closer scrutiny. <P></P>Despite talk of multilateralism and legality, America's impending war against Iraq has little to do with international co-operation or law. Images of a lawless and dangerous Iraq camouflage the <i>realpolitik</i> U.S. agenda. Indeed, the U.S. says as much by closing every discussion on Iraq with the promise that it will go it alone. <P></P>U.N. approval does, however, serve a purpose: It gives fence-sitters like Canada an excuse to join the campaign without looking too obsequious. <P></P>In making the case for war against Iraq, we are offered the following dialectic: Iraq is a rogue state possessing weapons of mass destruction ("WMD"), making it a threat to world security, and therefore requiring an externally imposed regime change. <P></P>Iraq has been in America's bad books for the last decade, ever since Saddam Hussein did not "play nice" with Kuwait. George Bush Sr. drew "a line in the sand" and launched the Gulf War, wreaking continuing havoc for Iraqis and the environment to "liberate" Kuwait's autocratic regime. <P></P>Although there was the usual bombast about freedom and democracy, the administration was surprisingly forthright in calling that war what it was: a war for oil.<P></P>Today, we are told that Iraq-the-rogue-state is an imminent global threat, because it possesses WMD. Saddam is alleged to possess an arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and is on the verge of developing nuclear capability.<P></P> Despite these dramatic claims, the U.S. and its sycophants have yet to produce any credible evidence of these threats. But assume for a moment that these allegations are correct. <P></P>The only conclusion, as Robert Fisk of the Independent newspaper notes, is that 10 years of economic embargo have been futile because Saddam's WMD program has not been deterred.<P></P>Worse, the loss of 500,000 children as a result of the sanctions was not "worth it," as then-U.S. secretary of state Madeline Albright claimed in 1996.<P></P> The story gets more interesting when one asks, who created the monster Saddam and his WMD?<P></P>It takes little effort to discover that Saddam's regime was raised on the support and largesse of the U.S. The Reagan administration encouraged Saddam in his brutal war with Iran during the 1980s, providing him with all manner of weapons from cluster bombs to anthrax. <P></P>Howard Teicher, a staff member at the National Security Council in the 1980s, shed light on this relationship; He accompanied Rumsfeld to Iraq to offer the assistance of the U.S. and Israel in Saddam's combat against Iran. Apparently, the morality of arming a rogue state with WMD is not particularly troublesome when the rogue gets busy causing grief for your enemies.<P></P>Some argue that America's prior relationship with Saddam doesn't preclude it getting religion on the WMD issue today. While prior sins do not preclude the sinner from changing his ways, newfound morality should not, if sincere, be subjectively applied. <P></P> Yet, the "rogue-state/regime-change" dialectic applies to a rather small subset of those who fit the description, with North Korea proving that even within the "axis of evil" some are more evil than others. <P></P>These are signs that Bush's zeal is being fuelled by something other than a sincere desire to protect the world against WMD.<P></P> This war is not about freedom or WMD, it is about pursuing and securing America's myopic short-term interests. America's lifeblood is oil; its economy, war machine and lifestyle depend on carbon fuels. Without oil, everything is at risk. And when it comes to oil, Iraq is a keystone. <P></P>Securing Iraq through regime change, occupation and the installation of a compliant government will ensure that the flow of oil is uninterrupted. As well, more direct control of the tap sends a message to those who might defy American hegemony.<P></P>War serves secondary interests as well; rising military expenditures bring temporary economic boosts. In addition, war's entertainment distracts from poverty, racism, health care and the crisis of American capitalism, all issues which present more serious challenges to America than invented rogues.<P></P>If the world came with a "pause" button, now would be the time to hit it. <P></P> We would marvel at Bush's trick of pulling a rabbit out of a hat by manufacturing a war against Iraq so swiftly. The rationale is weak and incredible, but the post-Sept. 11 climate of fear and belligerence makes easy work of this sleight-of-hand. How quickly "terror" has replaced the "red menace" as the all-purpose bogeyman. <P></P>The implications of Bush's Iraq adventure are troubling.<P></P> Violence is now a first level policy tool and policy, itself, is founded on narrow interests that totally disregard the interests of others.<P></P> By acting like the rogue states it vilifies, the U.S. is setting a disturbing precedent for the future of international relations; a precedent that will have negative consequences for us all, including the long-term interests of the United States itself.<P><i>Ziyaad Mia is a Toronto lawyer currently an LLM candidate at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Law.</i></p>
