<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON&#8212;It was no surprise yesterday that somebody finally asked U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld about the invisible coalition partners.
<P></P>Coalition partners? What coalition partners? a reporter in effect asked at yesterday's Pentagon briefing.<P></P>For half an hour, Rumsfeld and U.S. Army Gen. Tommy Franks talked about waging war alongside Washington's military allies against Iraq's Saddam Hussein. <P></P>"The coalition forces will prevail," Rumsfeld said repeatedly.<P></P>Yes, Bulgaria committed 150 non-combat troops. Croatia is allowing U.S. warplanes en route to Iraq to refuel. And Lithuania has opened its airspace.<P></P>But, other than a hefty 28,000-strong British force already on site in Kuwait, limited co-operation from Washington's Gulf State allies and a decision by Australia to send 150 members of its Special Air Service unit and a squadron of F-18s ... what?"Yes," agreed Rumsfeld. "The coalition is difficult to perceive."<P></P>But he argued that, with the U.S. resolution calling for force against Saddam stalled at the Security Council, no decision has been taken to declare war.<P></P>Nations are waiting to "make their judgments" based on concrete decisions to launch an assault against the Iraqi regime, he said.<P></P>"A large and growing number of countries has said to us that they want to participate," Rumsfeld insisted.<P></P>It's clear that many countries want to wait and see if the U.N. Security Council sanctions an attack on Iraq, a move that will supposedly make it easier on everyone, including Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr&#233;tien. Such authorization forged a strong coalition during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.<P></P>For the time being, Canada has sent military planners to Qatar but refused to make a commitment of ground troops to an Iraq campaign.<P></P>However, Canadian troops are spelling Iraqi-bound U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.<P></P>"Having made the substantial commitment to Afghanistan, we will not be in a position to send substantial troops for a year or more to any other country," Defense Minister John McCallum recently told the House of Commons.
<P></P>Retired general Lewis MacKenzie, former commander of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia, told the Star last night Rumsfeld's political problem might actually be a boon to Persian Gulf theatre-of-operations commander Franks.<P></P>"The political leadership wants to have as big a coalition as possible and that's what they are going for," said MacKenzie.<P></P>"But I think Tommy Franks would be quite happy with fewer (coalition) forces &#8212; he needs just enough troops to execute his plan," he said, adding that the more coalition troops are brought into the mix, the more complicated the command.<P></P>"(For the military) when you put together a coalition, you want it as small as possible," he said. "The political leadership wants as many people as they can enlist for the sake of international public opinion.<P></P>"It's not really a battle between the military and the politicians, but for the military, a big coalition is an irritant."<P></P>Interestingly, MacKenzie was to deliver a lecture this week at Alabama's Maxwell Air Base on the challenges of military coalition forces. <P></P>Scheduled to be delivered to the joint flying officers war-fighting course, it was cancelled at the last minute.<P></P>Sort of like Rumsfeld's coalition.</p>
