<p>Along with Iraq and North Korea, President Bush included Iran in his famous "axis of evil." Now that Saddam Hussein's regime has been tossed out of power in Iraq by invading U.S. and British forces, speculation is rife that Iran may be next. That notion is reinforced by the dispute between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency over suspicions of a covert Iranian nuclear weapons program.

<p>If the president intends to extend his romp through the Middle East, however, it is important for Americans to be aware of our history in the region. Our collective lack of historical perspective creates an opening for policymakers to paint almost any picture of reality they choose.

<p>At this point it's fairly clear that the Bush administration manipulated the facts and Americans' fear of terrorism to start a preemptive war in Iraq. We went to war to stabilize a region that is a breeding ground for violent anti-Americanism. Yet instead of stabilizing it, this war has put more pressure on both Iran and Syria, arguably making both countries much more dangerous to us.

<p>In the face of recent student protests in Iran, the Bush administration has decided to support Iran's democratic forces in the hope that there may soon be another Iranian revolution. But the administration is in for a disappointment. One need only compare the conditions leading up to the 1979 revolution and current conditions to see just how implausible a second revolt is.

<p>Of course, there's oil at the bottom of U.S. involvement in Iran. In 1951, the Iranian government voted to nationalize oil in order to keep profits in Iran. Britain (which had been controlling Iranian oil) took Iran to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in favor of Iran's right to keep the profits provided by its own oil wells. In 1953, the CIA orchestrated a coup that ousted Prime Minister Muhammad Mossadeq and reinstated Shah Muhammad Riza Pahlavi. 

<p>Iran became the United States' "democratic" stronghold in the Middle East. Unfortunately, the shah practiced totalitarian dictatorship. After a quarter-century of repression and economic inequities, the people of Iran revolted. They united behind Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his message of an Islamic Iranian state free from U.S. influence and interference. In the end, Khomeini led the Iranian revolution astray, forming an intolerant, conservative, theocratic government.

<p>It is fair to say that the general Iranian population harbors no illusions when it comes to the current government, but the greater movement is toward reform within the existing theocratic structure, not democratic revolution. We have to realize that student protests are not a reliable indicator of the social unrest, because students in all societies tend to be more radical and socially active than the general population. In 1979, people of all classes, not just students, cried out for change. Though unemployment and inflation are both on the rise, Iranians are not suffering terrible financial hardship -- and as long as Iranians remain financially comfortable, revolution is highly unlikely. The student rebels will simply be repressed.

<p>Another important difference between the current situation and the circumstances of the revolution in 1979 is the leadership and organization provided by clerics and the mosques. While the shah's regime had control of the media and political parties, it did not exert control over Iran's religious institutions. The relative freedom of the mosques, in conjunction with the widespread practice of Islam, created a framework within which the people of Iran could organize and communicate. 

<p>Today, the Iranian government exercises strict control over both religious and secular institutions, making it nearly impossible for people to organize opposition, to say nothing of resistance.

<p>Furthermore, Iran lacks emerging opposition leaders. In 1979, Khomeini was a vocal opponent of the shah and was able to inspire and animate the people of Iran. Today there are reformists within the government, but genuine democratic forces have been essentially eliminated, making it almost impossible for a moderate leadership to emerge. It is here that our recent experience in Iraq becomes vital.


<p>The current disarray and violence in Iraq has much to do with the lack of coherent opposition to Saddam Hussein's regime. The United States invaded and dismantled that regime with no viable replacement in sight. We are now faced with a violent power struggle; the prospect of a functional, democratic Iraq seems to be moving further out of reach. The establishment of the provisional Iraqi Governing Council was certainly a step in the right direction, but none of its members got there by way of a popular mandate and the violence has not abated. Indeed, the recent bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad makes the reality of a prolonged and violent occupation all too clear. 

<p>So if President Bush contemplates intervening in Iran, the American people ought to be certain that there is an organized, broad-based democratic opposition to the current regime. Otherwise we run the risk of another long-term, disorganized occupation and the appearance of expansionism.

<p>Our history in the Middle East is complicated and marked by an assumed superiority of purpose that has served only to hinder progress. The current administration's ahistorical, isolated approach to the world puts us at risk of failure there. And American citizens' lack of historical awareness makes us easy prey for politicians with an agenda.

<p>As long as we allow patriotism to be defined as blind faith in elected officials, young Americans will lose their lives in the name of half-truths and misrepresentations.
