<p>War is imminent, an act of insanity by a man who was not elected by a 
majority of American voters and who is influenced by a gaggle of ideologues 
who apparently want America to take over the world with the most dazzling 
array of high-tech weapons in history.
<P>Grassroots peace marches and vigils aren't making a difference to the 
Washington warmongers. It's really a different-looking protest crowd, not just 
the great unwashed of the Vietnam War-era, but soccer moms and their children, 
as well as white-haired women comfortable in their Saks Fifth Avenue outfits.
<P>This is a melancholic moment for me. I am thinking about the strange 
juxtaposition of some celebratory moments for Asian Americans, for example, 
and the impending war.
<P>In recent days, there's been a flood of laudatory articles in The Chronicle 
about the opening of the Asian Art Museum. In about a week, PBS will broadcast 
a three-part series applauding Chinese Americans for "making it," despite a 
history of racism and discrimination. For many Asian Americans, these are good 
times, if the kind of mainstream media and cultural attention represented by 
the Asian Art Museum and Bill Moyers' approval are a measure.
<P>I recently got a plea from an upscale Asian American group to join the 
Asian Art Museum (for $125) so that I could be part of the crowd in a special 
preview. I read a newspaper account about a glittery preview evening at the 
museum, where Asian and non-Asian partygoers went all out, wearing all manner 
of "native, ethnic" outfits -- silk this, brocade that.
<P>I chose not to join the Asian Art Museum, thus forgoing an opportunity to 
hobnob with my well-to-do brethren and their well-coiffed and bejeweled 
spouses, to say nothing of the best and brightest of the San Francisco social 
scene bedecked in, presumably, form-fitting cheongsams and silk jackets.
<P>Instead, I have chosen to bear quiet witness in peace marches and vigils. 
In one San Francisco march, I noticed a sprinkling of Asian faces, mostly 
youngish (20s and 30s). I know other Asian Americans have long been active in 
the peace movement, including my sister Nellie Wong, a renowned poet and 
socialist; acclaimed writer Maxine Hong Kingston and civil-rights activist 
Yuri Kochiyama. In a smaller demonstration, however, I saw only three other 
Asian faces in a crowd that was mostly white.
<P>I don't mean to ignite a class war among us yellows and don't want to 
disrespect the visionaries, organizers and supporters of such cultural 
institutions as the Asian Art Museum or PBS. Perhaps the timing is unfortunate 
that mainstream cultural events are focused on Asians and Asian Americans just 
as our mighty nation is about to bomb to smithereens a society that has 
descended from the cradle of civilization. Maybe it's an accident of history 
that that once mighty civilization is now led by a madman of its own, Saddam 
Hussein. That alone, however, does not justify what our own madman is about to 
do.
<P>I challenge my Asian brothers and sisters to reorder their priorities, as 
hard as that may be to do at a time when mainstream America, which has 
profoundly disrespected us, seems to be infatuated with us. Celebrate the 
Asian Art Museum. Feel good that PBS is saying nice things about us. But delve 
deeply into your own conscience to discover what you feel about what our 
nation is about to do to countless thousands of innocent people in Iraq.
