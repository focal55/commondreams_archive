<p>On June 23rd the Associated Press reported <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0623-09.htm">a story</a> about burned Iraqi children being turned away by US Army doctors.  The story revealed a callous attitude of military leaders toward the innocent victims, many of them children, of our war in Iraq. What’s even more shocking is that if one were to do a search of major newspapers worldwide one would find that this story shares similarities to a growing list of reports that cite US military indifference or direct action as the cause of suffering to Iraqi citizens. What makes this story stand out is the actions of Sergeant David Borell of Toledo, Ohio. He is the lone soldier who had the courage to draw a line in the sand and bring the incident to national attention in order to uphold the principles for which most Americans believe the war was fought.  At a time when our government’s motives for going to war in Iraq are being called into question it is at least reassuring to know that there is no question regarding the good character of so many of the enlisted men and women on the front lines. 

 

<p>In an effort to quell criticism of the army’s actions, or rather lack there of, public affairs officer Maj. David Accetta explained to the AP in an e-mail message that the children’s condition did not meet the Army’s criteria for treatment. He stated, "Our goal is for the Iraqis to use their own existing infrastructure and become self-sufficient, not dependent on U.S. forces for medical care."  But it was only after he was unable to get medical attention from the ill-equipped local hospital in Balad that the children’s father sought help from the US Army hospital. 

 

<p>Cicero once said, “Homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto,” I am a human being, nothing human is alien to me.  Humanity is very often a casualty of war.  War has the power of making both those who must kill and those who are killed seem less than human. Luckily it would seem that war has left Sgt. Borell with his humanity intact. When he first encountered the wounded children he said he was reminded of his own two daughters.  It is an utterly human view that seems to be at odds with the view of senior US officials in Iraq who often refer to civilian casualties as “collateral damage.”

 

<p>After the children were turned away by Army doctors, a distraught Sgt. Borell wondered how much it would have cost to treat the suffering children after giving them what little he had in the way of medical supplies from his first aid kit.  In political terms the answer to his question is that it would have cost much less than it did not to treat them. Not treating those children has only placed the hearts and minds of the Iraqi citizenry further out of reach. 

 

<p>Our leaders have shown us how easily they can defeat the enemy.  We have been significantly shocked and awed by the capacity of the US military for destruction but now is the time for healing.  While the military brass is apparently doing everything they can to cover their ends, Sgt. Borell has put his on the line for “duty, honor, and country.” It’s something good soldiers often do. According to the Toledo Blade, U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo) has asked the Defense Department to investigate the matter and recommended that Borell be promoted for bringing the dark incident to light.  A promotion is in order not merely for his compassion and actions above and beyond the call of duty but for his deft understanding of how to handle the volatile political situation in Iraq. Perhaps a huge promotion would send shockwaves through the US military and civilian leadership in Iraq so that the actions of this angel of mercy, Sgt. Borell, might touch “the better angels of their nature” as well.
