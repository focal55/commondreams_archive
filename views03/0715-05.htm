<p>George Bush is so shocked by AIDS sufferers in Africa because he never put a foot in Brooklyn. 

<p>At last count issued by the New York City Department of Health, Brooklyn had 31,636 people with AIDS. 

<p>At last count, Brooklyn had 19,659 die of AIDS.

<p>The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood had 7,399 with AIDS. The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood had 4,607 die.

<p>One neighborhood over, Brownsville-East New York, there were 2,734 cases and 1,824 deaths. This is more than in 12 states. 

<p>The government in Washington says it has real great compassion for people with AIDS and says it is funding places like Brooklyn. It funds with no funds. 

<p>You find AIDS at the The Brownsville Multi-Service Family Center, a green two-story building on Rockaway Avenue, between Blake and Dumont avenues. Yesterday, the sidewalk outside was a surf of small children twisting around their parents' legs. Inside, the reception room was filled with women and children - the center has obstetrics and pediatric services. 

<p>The center acts as much as it can, despite crowded waiting rooms, as a doctor's office. And then it also serves as a clinic for people walking in. They have an ophthalmology department, housing assistance and mental health counseling. But these are only for the normal diseases of a body. AIDS, scourge of the poor, dominates the building. 

<p>"When a woman comes in here pregnant, we suggest they take an HIV test, too," Collette Pean, project director for HIV prevention, was saying. "Whenever it comes out positive the woman is shocked. She doesn't know she's sick."

<p>Down one hall was a haggard man and a beleaguered woman.

<p>There was no way to tell how sick they were or with what. Nobody tells you they have AIDS and nobody asks. But there are 2,500 people with HIV or AIDS who come to this center. 

<p>With no sensational revelations coming from the white gay community of Greenwich Village, the vision of AIDS looming over daily life for so many faded. Many thought that the disease had been controlled and was on the way out.

<p>The count from Brooklyn shows this is frightfully wrong. No one could guess the ceaseless withering of thousands and thousands. This count goes up even more.

<p>This happens despite AIDS education, which became a term associated with life saving. There were pamphlets and lectures and magazines and books and television. What happened was the walking dead increased. 

<p>While it is stunning to see the number dying in South Africa, that country's president grapples with the label of being simple. It is beyond comprehension to think that people in a place such as New York could be so dumb as to think that AIDS is something that can be handled by dismissing the idea.

<p>Collette Pean says that the first reason for AIDS in Brooklyn is using dirty needles for heroin. You can get the needles free at a clinic. You can buy a needle at the drugstore for 25 cents. You can buy 10 of them without a prescription. 

<p>Instead, you have a guy with a dirty needle sitting on a stoop on the lip of the earth.

<p>But then we had the Cardinal of New York, John O'Connor, who roared, "I would rather sit up through the night nursing someone dying with AIDS before I would let him have a condom or a clean needle."

<p>If the Catholic church was run by such a man, what do you want from the streets of a poor Brooklyn neighborhood? 

<p>The second cause of AIDS is heterosexual sex. After that is gay sex.

<p>The heterosexual sex brings out the stupidity in people of any age. A worker at the center tells how human beings behave in a personal situation, where pride comes before danger. There are male and female condoms available. You have to wrestle with people to get them to use them.

<p>"He doesn't want to," a young woman told the worker.

<p>"I don't," he said.

<p>"Why don't you want safe sex?" the professional recalls asking him.

<p>"I can tell looking at her, she would never do that. She would never have sex with anyone but me. She told me she would have sex only with me."

<p>"I told him that," the girl said.

<p>"And you trust her," the professional said. 

<p>"With my life."

<p>The professional recollects that the girl said, "I trust him. He promised he would never have sex with anyone but me." 

<p>"On my father and mother," he said.

<p>They both were so sure that they needed no such thing as safe sex. They would go on in love and trust. The people at the center try to get men and women to negotiate over condom use. 

<p>"What happened with them?" the professional was asked.

<p>"I'm not sure what happened to them. Sometimes you don't see people. They go away and get sick and then they go to some other center. They're embarrassed to come back here."

<p>Before Bush comes up here to film commercials for a campaign that he is starting right now, he might take a ride across one of the bridges and see suffering in Brooklyn. Then when he's asked about it, he won't have to lie.
