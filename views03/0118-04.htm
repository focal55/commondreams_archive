<p>One of the most important votes of 2003 will be cast not in Congress or
in voting booths across the country but at the Federal Communications
Commission. At stake is how TV, radio, newspapers and the Internet will
look in the next generation and beyond. At stake are core values of
localism, competition, diversity and maintaining the vitality of
America's marketplace of ideas. And at stake is the ability of consumers
to enjoy creative, diverse and enriching entertainment.</p>
<p>

But most people and most journalists are ignoring this momentous vote.
Last year FCC chair Michael Powell announced that the commission would
vote this spring on whether to scrap, modify or retain our media
concentration protections. These rules currently limit a single
corporation from dominating a local TV market; from merging a
community's TV stations and newspapers into one voice; from merging two
major TV networks; and from controlling more than 35 percent of TV
households in the nation. And now we are on the verge of dramatically
altering the nation's media landscape without the national debate that
this issue merits.</p>
<p>

What will happen if these rules disappear or are significantly loosened?
We have some history to guide us. The FCC eliminated many of its radio
consolidation rules in 1996. This action has already caused real
problems, according to numerous media experts. Conglomerates now own
hundreds of stations across the country. One company, Clear Channel,
owns more than 1,200. Today there are 30 percent fewer radio station
owners than there were before the commission abandoned its rules in
1996. Most local radio markets are oligopolies. More and more
programming originates outside local stations' studios--far from
listeners and their communities.</p>
<p>

Media watchers like the Media Access Project, the Center for Digital
Democracy and Consumers Union argue that this concentration has led to
far less coverage of news and public interest programming and less
localism. A study by the Future of Music Coalition strongly suggests
that consolidation has led to the homogenization of music. Many
observers say that radio now serves more to advertise the products of
vertically integrated conglomerates than to inform or entertain
Americans with the best and most original programming. In addition, the
work of the Parents Television Council shows that offensive and indecent
programming has grown more pervasive on radio. As programming decisions
are wrested from our local communities and made instead in distant
corporate headquarters, our children are exposed to more and more
offensive material.</p>
<p>

Despite this history, we are now about to decide whether to eliminate
the rules that govern the rest of the media world. If all these rules
are scrapped or if the FCC seriously weakens them, one company could
dominate a region's access to information by controlling its radio
stations, television stations, newspaper and cable system. And those who
believe the Internet will save us from this fate should realize that the
dominant Internet news sources are owned by the same media giants who
control radio, TV, newspapers and cable. The fate of cable television
and the emerging fate of the Internet should teach us that new
technology alone, without rules that protect against its being co-opted
by media giants, will not guarantee healthy, independent local media.</p>
<p>

Yet the FCC is charging ahead without adequately studying the vast
consequences of its actions. It has resisted calls to hold public
hearings. Only under pressure did it agree to hold one lone official
hearing in Richmond, Virginia. Most Americans don't even know that
momentous decisions are about to be made. It is the FCC's responsibility
to tell them and to solicit their thoughts. Failure to do so disserves
the public interest and makes it appear that the commission is trying to
eliminate concentration protections in the dark of night.</p>
<p>

But it is also the media's responsibility to bring this story to the
public. That hasn't happened yet. Indeed, some very important media
enterprises have financial interests riding on the outcome of the
ownership proceedings. The very institutions we rely on to be a forum
for this debate are the institutions most affected by its outcome. The
media are at pains to assure us their newsgathering operations are
independent of their corporate interests. Here is an opportunity to test
that claim.</p>
<p>

Suppose for a moment that the FCC votes to remove or significantly
modify the concentration protections. Suppose that turns out to be a
mistake. How would we ever put the genie back in the bottle? The answer
is that we could not. That's why we need a national dialogue on the
issue and better data and analysis. We need this debate in Congress, at
the commission, among concerned industries, in the media and all across
America. The future of the media, a key part of the infrastructure of
democracy, hangs in the balance.</p>
