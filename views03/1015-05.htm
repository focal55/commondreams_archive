<p>SO THE NATIONAL Enquirer was right-Rush Limbaugh does have a drug problem. 
As you probably know by now, the archconservative radio personality has 
admitted having a painkiller addiction.

<p>Though it may take a bit of self-discipline for some of us, we should resist

any temptation to revel in Limbaugh's misfortune-or vilify him for his 
apparently illegal behavior (it seems inconceivable that he could have fed 
his habit without illegally obtaining the drugs).  Like millions of 
Americans, Limbaugh has a serious health problem-a debilitating dependency 
on  addictive substances.

<p>Limbaugh's admission should be greeted as an opportunity to  acknowledge a 
few truths: 1) drug abuse is primarily a public health problem; 2) the 
get-tough criminal-justice approach to the problem causes more harm than 
good; and 3) the war on drugs  disproportionately targets those who don't 
fall into the same demographic as Limbaugh.

<p>For years, while our prisons have filled to the point of overflowing with 
nonviolent drug offenders who tend to be poor and nonwhite, the right wing 
has gotten gobs of political mileage out of pushing a 
lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key agenda.

<p>Not surprisingly, Limbaugh has given (loud) voice to this zealotry. In the 
mid-1990s, he said: "There's nothing good about drug use.  And we have laws 
against selling drugs, pushing drugs, using drugs, importing drugs. And the 
laws are good because we know what happens to people
in societies and neighborhoods which become consumed by them. And so if 
people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and 
they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up."

<p>Limbaugh went on to question the claim that too many people of color were 
being locked up on drug charges, but concluded that if that were the case, 
it simply meant that more white drug offenders had to be put behind bars, 
too.

<p>Maybe now Limbaugh will want to reconsider his position. If so, he could 
start by digesting this information:

<p>* Drug offenders make up nearly 60 percent of all federal inmates, according

to The Sentencing Project, which advocates alternatives to the 
mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws that are filling up our prisons. The group

also notes that there has been a thirteenfold increase in the number of drug

offenders in state prisons since 1980, and that they now account for a fifth

of all state prisoners.

<p>* Most of the people who wind up in the slammer for drug offenses are small 
fish in the narcotics trade and  generally have no prior record of 
committing violent crimes, The Sentencing Project reports.

<p>* Three-fourths of all convicted drug offenders are people of color, a ratio

vastly disproportionate to their share of drug users in society, according 
to The Sentencing Project.

<p>If race and, to a large degree, class are major factors in determining who 
gets busted on drug charges, the laws themselves ensure that people will do 
time once convicted. Mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws, enacted in the 
mid-1980s as politicians fell over themselves proving they were tough on 
crime, guarantee that the prisons will fill up, but do little to get most 
drug addicts the help they need to kick their destructive habits.

<p>Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and even the 
conservative William Rehnquist have questioned the wisdom of 
one-size-fits-all sentencing laws. But that exemplar of the moralistic 
right, Attorney General John Ashcroft, last month instructed federal 
prosecutors to rat out judges who depart from the government's rigid 
sentencing guidelines.

<p>Ashcroft's opposition to greater sentencing flexibility makes certain that 
nonviolent drug offenders will continue to be dealt lengthy prison terms-and

that will hurt lots of us in these tough times, because money spent 
warehousing convicts is money that won't be used to build schools, provide 
health care, or close yawning budget gaps.

<p>Given the staggering cost of keeping so many Americans locked up ($30,000 a 
year, on average, for a state inmate), it should come as little surprise 
that 18 states and the District of Columbia have implemented  reforms since 
the mid-1990s that offer more flexibility in sentencing and alternatives to 
incarceration.

<p>We need to rethink not only mandatory-minimum sentences, but also a drug war

that targets certain racial and income groups and approaches a public-health

epidemic almost exclusively from a criminal-justice perspective.

Limbaugh now is in a position to be a persuasive advocate of a more sensible

strategy for combating our nation's drug problem. Here's hoping that he gets

cleaned up-and that a sober Limbaugh becomes more susceptible to reason on 
the drug issue.
