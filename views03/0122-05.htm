<p>The members of America's so-called Greatest Generation &#8212; those who fought in World War II &#8212; were not themselves in any way necessarily the greatest, in the sense of being the best and bravest.<P></P>But because of the challenges they had to face, many of its members became unusually mature, more fully grounded, more understanding of the importance of the general good rather than just of their own.<P></P>That generation, which took part in what is accepted universally as a good war, a just war, is now sending out a most significant message about the war America is about to engage in against Iraq.<P></P>A good many remaining members of the Greatest Generation are saying they aren't at all sure this war will be a good war, a just war.<P></P>Two recent polls show this. A survey of 5,000 Americans by Pew Research in Washington has found that while 60 per cent of Americans of all ages support a war against Iraq, only 41 per cent of those aged 75 or more do so.<P></P>
A survey by the Los Angeles Times similarly found that while 58 per cent of Americans favor the war, support among those aged 75 or more drops to 35 per cent.
<P></P>Those Americans who know most about war and about the meaning of moral clarity in conflict, are the most skeptical about the morality of the war their country is about to engage in.<P></P>For President George W. Bush, this finding ought to be deeply disturbing. Far more disturbing than the fact that opposition to the war should now be mounting right across Europe, including in Britain, his closest ally. Similar sentiments are found in Canada (only 15 per cent now support unilateral U.S. action), and in the Middle East itself, such as in Turkey, another close ally, where public opinion is forcing the government to scale back to a minimum the facilities it can provide to U.S. forces.<P></P>The particular point of concern for Bush ought to be that the boast that he's been waging war against terrorism with a particular "moral clarity" is now being challenged.<P></P>Until now, that claim has been pretty persuasive. Rather than the ambiguity and relativism and tortured self-guilt so common these days, Bush has dared to define as black and white an issue that, in fact, is ultimately black and white, namely, that terrorism is evil and that its victims are victims.<P></P> There has always also been a disturbing overlap between Bush's moral clarity and plain moral simplicity. Bush's good/evil, we/they division of the world, while deeply felt, was also calculatingly convenient. It provided an escape from the need to consider why it was that these terrorists existed at all (other than in the simple-minded formulation, "they hate us"), and thus to have to examine the role in helping to create terrorism of American foreign policy or of the ever-widening global income gaps.<P></P>The appeal of Bush's moral clarity persisted, nevertheless, because it was decisive and bold, and most plainly and simply, clear. <P></P>Each day now, as Bush gets closer and closer to invading Iraq, that priceless asset of his is wasting away.<P></P> The contrast between Bush's bellicose policy towards Iraq, which has no nuclear weapons, or none of consequence, and his diplomatic dealings with North Korea, which has both bombs and the missiles to deliver them, is too obvious to be justified except by resort to the old arguments of realism and of national interest. These may be valid pragmatically; they most certainly are not moral.<P></P>As for the core justification for invading Iraq &#8212; it has a program of weapons of mass destruction that could threaten the region and even the world &#8212; it is looking increasingly unsustainable. Two months of the most intensive inspection in history &#8212; the U.S. itself would be deeply embarrassed by a far-less intrusive inspection regime &#8212; has produced no "smoking gun."<P></P>Beyond question, Iraq did once have such a program, although a pretty backward one technologically. But such a threat could easily be contained by continued United Nations inspections reinforced by military sanctions. <P></P>
The U.S., in short, is going to war because it wants to go to war, whether for oil, or to avenge family honor, or, probably, because Bush would lose too much face if he didn't invade Iraq.
<P></P>Those old geezers, who actually know about war, have figured this out. They won't be able to stop him, any more than will all the mounting street demonstrations and peace marches.<P></P>But while Bush will still have his war it'll now be just that &#8212; his war, rather than a war against terrorism or for some higher morality.<P><i>Richard Gwyn appears Wednesday and Sunday.</i></P>
