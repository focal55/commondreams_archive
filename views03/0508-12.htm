<p>The ideals and values expressed in the written
words of our Founding Fathers continue to dominate our
loftiest expectations of our nation.  America
represents democracy.  We identify our nation with
liberty, equality, truth, justice, civil rights,
humanity, dignity, integrity, progressiveness, and
freedom.  We picture ourselves as a role model for
other nations, a measure towards which they should
strive, a trusted friend and partner.

<p>Star Trek optimistically envisions the future of
our planet as a time during which all people will
unite and work harmoniously together.  We will join
peoples from other worlds in forming an egalitarian
federation that obeys the prime directive of never
interfering in the internal affairs of other nations
and peoples, that strives for compassion and
understanding, and that considers societies dominated
by the desire for monetary gain and conquest as
primitive.

<p>President Bush offers America a totally different
future.

<p>Much of his vision derives from that of the Project
for the New American Century: as the world's only
superpower the United States should dominate the
world's resources for economic, strategic, and
political advantage.  From that commanding position
the US can build an empire unencumbered by the rules, regulations, and requirements of others. 
Domestically, business interests and the enrichment of America's most wealthy individuals supersede all other interests, needs, and rights.

<p>Star Trek would likely portray the PNAC as a
radical neoconservative fringe group with strong
upper-level government connections and members bent on pillaging the riches of the world and subverting the interests of their government and its people for their own selfish goals and profit.  

<p>Mr. Bush now intends to export his vision of
democracy to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the rest of the
Middle East.
          
<p>Shortly after terrorists slammed airplanes into the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing over
three thousand people, Mr. Bush sought retribution
from those responsible for attacking these symbols of capitalism and militarism.  He claimed they attacked symbols of democracy and liberty. History may side with Mr. Bush: democracy and liberty just might equal capitalism imposed by military means. 

<p>While our Founding Fathers spoke and wrote
eloquently, they also predominantly represented the
interests of business and the land's most wealthy
individuals.  Historians argue they chose their lofty
words to help recruit more soldiers and support from
the lower classes of colonial society for the
Revolution.  They designed a government that excluded
the native people, slaves, non-landowners, and women
from voting and other rights.  

<p>Throughout our nation's history many other leaders
have spoken great words, sometimes meaningfully, too
often manipulatively, while government and business
have predominantly worked hand in hand.  Yet the
historic preeminence of such practices does not
necessarily validate their desirability or
correctness. 
 
<p>In spite of whatever might have been the real
intentions behind our Founding Fathers great words,
many Americans truly believe in the ideals and values
they expressed.  Many also believe in those envisioned
by Star Trek.
 
<p>Before Mr. Bush progresses too far in imposing his
concepts on the rest of the world, the people of this
nation should determine whether or not they agree with
his vision.  A national forum should develop to openly
explore, debate, and determine the position of the
American people on the major issues that define our
nation and chart our future.  We should reassess
America's goals, values, ideals, and mission.
    
<p>Americans could choose whether they prefer a
government run as a government or a government run as
a business.  In the process of reaching such a basic
decision debates would likely surface over such topics
as national health insurance, privatized water
systems, ending mail delivery to those in outlying
areas, and letting the poor starve and the weak die.

<p>Americans could decide whether they want people or
money to control their government, whether they want
increased civil rights and liberties or increased
government surveillance and restrictions, whether they
want freedom of information or even greater media
consolidation and greater corporate and government
secrecy, whether they want more financial independence
or more power and wealth to consolidate into fewer and
fewer hands, and whether they want international
relations conducted through building friendships and understanding among equals or as superiors solving problems militarily, bombing other nations into submission, and building an empire.  
   
<p>Some degree of urgency exists in creating such a
forum since without it Mr. Bush's representation of
our essence wins by default.  Americans still have a
choice: the future promised by our Founding Fathers
and envisioned by Star Trek or the one proposed by Mr.
Bush.
 
<p>The world awaits our decision.
