<p>The Pentagon's 
            online &quot;terror&quot; futures market may have gone down in 
            flames, but questions surrounding 9/11 insider trading and market 
            rigging before the Iraq invasion still linger.
<p>
            In a much-aligned 
            plan the Pentagon described as &quot;engaging and ... 
            profitable,&quot; anonymous traders were invited to bet on the 
            likelihood of Middle Eastern death and destruction; public outcry 
            forced the &quot;Policy Analysis Market&quot; (PAM) plan to be yanked 
            days before its scheduled launch.
<p>
            But allegations 
            about the ultimate &quot;terror&quot; futures market, 9/11 insider 
            trading, have yet to be adequately addressed. It's known that just weeks
             before the attacks, <A href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/oct2001/bond-o05.shtml" target="_new">speculative trading surged on companies to be 
            hardest hit</A>, such as those located in the World Trade 
            Center. There was a rally in five-year US Treasury notes, the best 
            investment in times of US crisis, and sales of airline-based put 
            options (bets a stock's price will fall) increased sharply too; 
            interestingly, many
             such put options were <A href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/10_09_01_krongard.html" target="_new">sold through a firm previously managed by top 
            CIA director</A>, A.B. &quot;Buzzy&quot; Krongard.
<p>
            Estimates of 9/11 
            profit-taking are in the billions of dollars, and according to Dylan 
            Ratigan of Bloomberg Business News, &quot;This could very well be 
            insider trading at the worst, most horrific, most evil use you've 
            ever seen in your entire life. This would be one of the most 
            extraordinary coincidences in the history of mankind if it was a coincidence.&quot;
<p>
            Bowing to public 
            pressure, the FBI and other federal watchdogs promised swift and 
            thorough investigations into potential 9/11 insider trading. 
            Significant that today, almost two years after the attacks, no 
            progress seems to have been made.
<p>
            It's also 
            indicative that the US government didn't take market volatility 
            preceding 9/11 more seriously, especially since the rationale behind 
            its recent PAM terror-trading scheme was that the &quot;extremely 
            efficient&quot; predictive quality of futures markets could enhance 
            national security.
<p>
            But some analysts 
            charge the Bush administration has actually been too active in the 
            markets, effectively <A href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/business/articles/timid60605?version=1" target="_new">manipulating
             levels to build up public support before its invasion of Iraq</A>.
             Here's how analysts say it worked: a secretive US governmental 
            committee orchestrated massive selling in the euro, crude and gold 
            right before the invasion, effectively lowering prices and bumping up 
            the dollar. The covert committee simultaneously purchased targeted 
            Dow Jones equities to prop up the relatively unsophisticated index, 
            thereby creating a rally big enough to calm investors. How else, 
            analysts say, to explain the market rally when it seemed an invasion 
            would be postponed, followed by a rally one week later at news war 
            was imminent?
<p>
            The fact that a 
            team of US governmental and Wall Street leaders periodically moves 
            the markets in US interests is undisputed; the group was created by <A href="http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/codification/executive_order/12631.html" target="_blank">Executive
             Order 12631</A> in the Reagan years and continues today under 
            the nickname Plunge Protection Team.
<p>
            What is less 
            clear, however, is if the Bush administration's desired invasion of 
            Iraq was deemed a US interest vital enough to rig the markets.
<p>
The Pentagon's 
            dubious futures-market scheme may have been axed, but far too many 
            questions surrounding the link between US stock markets, war and 
            terrorism remain.
