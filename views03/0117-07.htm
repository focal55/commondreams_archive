<p>Today, in the deep chill of winter, I sit comfortably in a warm room (courtesy of a non-renewable fossil fuel) working at a computer (components probably made by low-wage workers on the Pacific Rim), sipping a mug of hot chocolate (possibly produced by child-slaves in Africa) and listening to Joseph Haydn’s Missa in Tempore Belli, written in August 1796, when Austria was under threat of war from Napoleon’s troops in Italy. 
<p>Two centuries later we are again (or still) in tempore belli, in a time of belligerence on the verge of war under the rubric of stopping "terrorism". Our President has assumed war powers against this abstraction but seems to understand it only as a license for attacking a small nation for its oil and cutting taxes for his friends. 
<p>Far from stopping terrorists, Bush is doing everything to help them: setting the U.S. up against the rest of the world, undermining the rights and freedoms of  our democratic government, reneging on treaties for the common good, depleting the natural wealth of his own nation and the planet, protecting the wealthy at the expense of poor, ill-nourished, ill-educated, disenfranchised, and oppressed people world-wide.
<p>And far from stopping terrorism, Bush is actually adopting it, using ever-more inhumane and barbaric weapons and tactics to kill more efficiently and wage endless wars. 
<p>Our President and a Congress in the hire of weapons manufacturers and oil producers are busily spending the wealth, resources and talent of the U.S. to make war instead of investing in the future of humanity and life on our small, finite planet.
<p>Any nation that spends its wealth on oil and weapons gets exactly what it pays for. Any nation that doesn’t nurture and educate its youth and invest in the health of its citizens gets only what it invests in. Any nation that doesn’t control greed and lust for power gets an elite ruling class that must defend its wealth and power with violence and fear from a citizenry kept ignorant, dispirited, and fearful. Any nation that consumes its natural wealth gets a depleted land and poisoned water and air. And any nation that exploits other nations’ wealth or people wins the hatred and scorn of the rest of the world.
<p>Apparently President Bush honestly believes that the world is driven by fear and power, and that it will be made better by his resolute deployment of murder, destruction and terror. So did Hitler, so did Pol Pot. Saddam Hussein isn’t even in the same class -- he’s just a petty, egotistical dictator, exhilarated by being rich and feared by his own people and the President of the United States.
<p>Yet anytime -- ANYTIME -- someone comes to us saying that to make the world better or safer, it is necessary to make war on another nation or use nuclear weapons, we have a human duty rise up and assert the sacredness of life and our fragile planet, and the primacy of respect for others’ lives and liberties.
<p>Natural selection over millions of years has developed human skills and institutions well adapted to enable societies of a few hundreds -- maybe even thousands -- to live off the renewable resources of their environment. Human societies have now grown to great size and complexity and developed powerful political, economic and military systems and institutions. They have also created immense technological power -- in communications, transport, energy, healing and weapons -- to do things unimaginable two hundred years ago. 
<p>Natural selection has not had time to generate skills and institutions appropriate to living in societies of millions that consume Earth’s resources and modify the biosphere itself. In another few million years it might do so, but the learning curve is steep, the risks are high, and the costs incalculable. 
<p>Present humans may not be clever enough, and their technology and institutions may not be adaptable enough to manage global, biological, technological, and political systems of the magnitude and complexity we have created. Bush may not even understand the problems, but his crony-capitalist friends think they do, and further assume they can manage the world -- and make a profit doing it. But even if American know-how could manage the whole world, should it?  After all, we aren’t alone on this planet. There are some 5 3/4 billion other people who live here too, and would like some say in how -- and especially if -- they should live.
<p>Haydn’s Missa in Tempore Belli begins, as is traditional, with an appeal for mercy from an all-powerful, supernatural being. Thereafter, like so much of human endeavor, the music of human goodness -- love, mercy, hope -- plays against the ancient fundamentalist texts of power, evil, and terror.
<p>Two hundred years ago people had little recourse against the tides of war except to plead for heavenly mercy. Nevertheless, Haydn’s mass ends not with despair and craven pleading to be spared the horrors of war, but with hope and an undaunted demand for peace --emphasized with kettledrums. 
<p>The drums of war and terrorism are toneless, evoking fear and futility. The drums of peace are tunable, harmonious with life, resonant with hope. In this time of war it is our duty -- our honor -- to tune our kettledrums to human hopes, and raise a great chorus to the world: 
<p><i>Dona nobis pacem. </i>
