<p>Prophets are everywhere . First there was Isaiah, paraphrased by President Bush in his eulogy to the seven dead astronauts. 'Lift your eyes and look to the heavens. Who created all these? He who brings out the starry hosts one by one, and calls them each by name.' <P>Then came Colin Powell, a seer accorded the Cassandra fate of being forever disbelieved, at least in Paris, Moscow and Beijing. What Secretary Powell's warnings lacked in novelty or substance was balanced by his phial of (US-made) anthrax, his grainy espionage shots and a rhetoric blending Blackpool beach clairvoyancy and Old Testament gloom.  <P>All suspicion and no proof,  Le Monde complained the next day. That is not quite fair. It is true that, in trying to hitch Iraq to the war on terror, Bush and Blair have offered the long-running impression of a Jane Austen matriarch attempting to betroth an ageing daughter to a regency buck. Once again, Secretary Powell offered no credible evidence that Saddam and al-Qaeda are an item.  <P>Otherwise, his case was plausible, if you discount the toytown security dossier compiled by the internet pirates of Downing Street. Saddam, as we knew, has chemical and biological weapons. He is a murderous tyrant bent on obfuscation. Powell's assertions of mobile laboratories and field officers whispering of nerve agents did not sound mad. The absence of even a smoking catapult may not matter. You can buy almost the entire Powell package, agree that victory might be swift and still reject the case for war.  <P>It is late. We are past the five to mid night set by Hans Blix, the chief weapons inspector. Saddam's attempts to turn back time are likely to be spurned by Bush. The 'Screaming Eagles', the 101st Airborne Division whose 36-hour deployment capacity makes it the harbinger of war, have landed. In this time of nemesis, doves are pitied, or reviled in the case of Tony Benn and his Listen with Saddam broadcast, suitable for credulous under-fives.  <P>And still the case for peace is stronger than the argument for war. The imperative of smashing Saddam before he goes for us ignores three caveats. There is no sign he plans to do so. Pre-emption encourages the bellicose, from Washington to Pyongyang, to arm up and strike first. And we have been here before.  <P>'The international community cannot tolerate continued Iraqi defiance. There is too much at stake for the UN and the world.' That was George Bush Senior in 1992, deeming inspections a failure. But containment worked, however patchily, for 10 years more. What changed things? 11 September, Afghanistan, and a President with old scores to settle, oilfields to secure and the need for a scalp to flourish. Since Osama bin Laden's head could not be sourced, the substitute was Saddam, a monster with a pedigree and postcode. He turned out to be no closer to al-Qaeda than the network's 60 other mostly unwitting hosts, but at least Bush knew where he lived.  <P>Such arguments repel advocates of a humane war. Only a democratic revolution can really help the children of Iraq, they say, and they may be right. But there is no certainty that an imposed solution would work in a country with no track record of democracy.  <P>The UN is sure, conversely, that urbanised Iraqi children will suffer worse than their rural Afghan counterparts did in a war that killed 5,000 civilians outright and ordained the deaths of 20,000 more. The price, in torment and the torn bodies that rarely make it on to CNN, may be terrible. Plans for rebuilding a wrecked country are vestigial. A democratic war, prosecuted by Britain, a nation acting without the democratic mandate of its own parliament, and against the wishes of a majority of its people, carries no warranty of salvation.  <P>We are terrified lest our own children, a generation of PlayStation generals, are corrupted by mock violence. Dare we subject Iraqi children to the real thing, confident beyond reasonable doubt that it will all be for the best? Ends rarely justify the means, particularly when the outcome is so opaque, for them and us. You can guess at how much weaponry Saddam may be incubating, but hatred is impossible to calibrate.  <P>This conflict, the successor to the more legitimate first Gulf War, may be a touchpaper for terror. It may, in David Owen's dreams, also be a necessary prerequisite for a Palestinian solution, although it is hard to see how war would make Israel feel more secure, or Washington's neo-conservatives more benign. Then there is equivalence. Syria, Egypt, Iran and Libya have chemical weapons. Some rogue states, and the US, maintain a cavalier attitude to arms proliferation treaties. Why Iraq? Why now? the peacemakers ask. In part, and paradoxically, through the actions of those who called for Resolution 1441.  <P>Bush's wimps' charter also supplied a potential casus belli where none existed. If the arms inspectors report a material breach by Saddam, the trigger for 'serious consequences' is in place. The Security Council, a useful brake on conflict, should not be a sop to fragile consciences. Unanimity procured because France wants the spoils of war, Russia is buyable and China abstains would offer no moral imprimatur.  <P>The second resolution demanded both by Blair, who needs its sanction, and by doubters seeking consolation would make war more consen sual, not purer. The emphasis, as Kofi Annan wishes, should stay on containment. An imperfect policy, even if Saddam Hussein is more compliant, it remains the last best solution, on which the safety and the peace of the world may hinge.  <P>But the tide runs fast the other way. Bush is intent on a war predicated, in Dustin Hoffman's synopsis, on 'money, oil, power and suits'. In the eyes of humanitarian hawks, it is a war of mercy, even though the prime object is the West's protection. It is also about imperialism, global hegemony and God.  <P>No, Bush and Blair do not pray together, as Jeremy Paxman discovered. The crude question seemed, understandably, to infuriate Blair. Even so, God is, I believe, the coalescing agent of this war, the unifying bond between a Prime Minister guided by religious certitude and a President in thrall to bible and gun. The countdown, presented as a play-off between Hobbes, an advocate of superpower rule, and Kant, the patron of the nation state, is presided over by a higher force.  <P>War, if it cannot be stopped, will be the ultimate in modern retribution, an initiation into the virtual way of death. It may become, or lead to, the first nuclear conflict of the century. It will also echo back through 2,500 years of bloodshed justified by the sway of good over evil. Bush should have studied Old Testament prophecy further.  <P>The President's anointed guardian of astronauts' souls also foretold the destruction of the land Saddam now rules. Even at a time when the vengeance of the righteous went unquestioned, the prophet recoiled from the 'grievousness' of war. 'Babylon is fallen; is fallen, and all the graven images of her gods broken unto the ground' - Isaiah, chapter XXI, verse nine. Here we go again. </p>
