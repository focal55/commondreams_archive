<p>After five years spent working to end the sanctions on Iraq, I find myself 
in an odd position. I'm opposed to the current U.S. plans to end the sanctions.
<p>The new situation is fascinating. For a dozen years, every time we in the 
anti-sanctions movement talked about the suffering caused by the sanctions 
(well over 500,000 children under the age of five dead and a society in 
ruins), the constant refrain  from the Bush administration, the Clinton 
administration, and the Bush administration -- was that the suffering was 
not caused by sanctions but by the regime. Once the regime is destroyed,
miraculously, the Bush administration realizes overnight that sanctions 
were actually harmful and that it's necessary to remove that burden from
the Iraqi people in order to provide humanitarian aid and reconstruction.

<p>Adding to the confusion, the two countries on the Security Council 
previously most against continuation of the sanctions, France and Russia, 
did an about-face and opposed the U.S. plans. Both (especially Russia) have 
insisted that sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors 
certify that Iraq is disarmed of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This is 
true even though Vladimir Putin of Russia openly mocked Tony Blair about
the dramatically unconfirmed claims by "coalition" members that Iraq 
possessed WMD that posed a threat to the world.

<p>Did this administration, which tried to keep Iraqi infants from being 
vaccinated for diphtheria and limited imports of streptomycin into the 
country, see a blinding light on the road to Baghdad? And did other 
countries suddenly decide that the deaths of Iraqi children was, as 
Madeleine Albright put it in an interview in 1996, a price worth 
paying  and this time merely in order to uphold a trivial legalistic argument?

<p>Actually, it's not so confusing. The United States has moved to consolidate 
control over Iraq. The talks being held by selected members of the "Iraqi 
opposition" under the control of the U.S. military are not intended to 
create an independent government, but rather one which is tightly 
controlled by the United States  just as in Afghanistan. As in Afghanistan, 
the meetings are excluding entire segments of the political spectrum. They 
are being done with express disregard of calls across that spectrum for 
meetings to be held under neutral U.N. auspices rather than under those of 
an occupying power with clear plans for increased regional domination.

<p>Those plans have become clear as well. The Bush administration wants to set 
up permanent military bases in Iraq, making it the main Middle East staging 
area for U.S. "force projection." The massive political leverage given by 
this presence will be used as a club against Iran and Syria and also to 
force the Palestinians to acquiesce to the Israeli occupation through the 
latest "peace plan." The administration also wants not only to open up 
future Iraqi exploration to foreign corporations (with U.S. and maybe 
British corporations presumably favored) but to privatize, at least in 
part, the state oil companies and their currently producing wells.

<p>All of these things can be obtained through the U.S. military presence and 
the creation of what will essentially be an Iraqi puppet government. 
However, some problems are the kind that can't be solved by bombs. Existing 
U.N. resolutions require Security Council approval for Iraqi oil sales and 
for disbursement of oil money to pay for other goods. Other countries may 
be leery of buying Iraqi oil without some clear understanding that what 
they're doing is legal, so the United States cannot simply declare those
resolutions void by fiat, the way it declared war on Iraq.

<p>The draft resolution being currently circulated would give the United 
States very open, explicit control over Iraq's oil industry and the money 
derived therefrom. Then, instead of being forced to disburse USAID funds to 
corporations like Bechtel that are closely tied to current and past 
administration figures in closed bidding processes with no foreign 
corporations allowed, the United States will be able to use Iraq's money to 
pay off mostly American corporations. In the process, it will try to escape 
the legal obligation it shares with the United Kingdom: since they 
committed an illegal aggressive war (with no Security Council 
authorization) against Iraq, they are financially responsible for the 
reconstruction. Iraq should not have to pay for its own reconstruction, 
especially since for years to come its oil revenues will be barely enough 
to meet the basic needs of its people.

<p>This fundamental violation of the rights of the Iraqi people is being done 
in the name of the immediate crisis faced. Yet the way that the sanctions 
work is not the way they used to. Most imports are automatically approved 
without any requirement for deliberation by the Sanctions Committee. 
Furthermore, the biggest bureaucratic delays were created by deliberate 
U.S. understaffing, so that there were never enough people to review all
the proposed contracts (see Joy Gordon's article "Cool War: Economic 
Sanctions as a Weapon of Mass Destruction, Harper's, November 2002). 
Finally, all members of the Security Council have indicated willingness to 
cooperate in expediting the release of all goods required for immediate 
needs. In the long run, the sanctions must be lifted because they impose a 
highly inefficient foreign control of the Iraqi economy, causing the 
collapse of local economic activity and requiring money that should be 
spent internally to be spent on foreign corporations; in the short run, 
there is no compelling reason to lift them in the absence of a legitimate 
Iraqi government that has the right to make choices about how Iraq's oil
wealth is to be used for the benefit of the Iraqi people, not for U.S. 
corporate boondoggles and plans for military-based political domination.

<p>France and Russia are opposing this move (France rather weakly), not 
because of any genuine concern about WMD, but for two reasons. First, the 
venal one: they don't want to be completely shut out of any lucrative 
postwar contracts and certainly want to hang on to oil concession deals 
signed with the previous Iraqi regime. Second, a reason that activists in 
the United States and elsewhere should support fully: they don't want to
retroactively legitimize U.S. aggression and thus contribute further to its 
more and more openly imperial role in the world.

<p>In fact, overt subordination of the United Nations to the United States is 
a central part of the Bush administration agenda. It has served notice that 
the U.N. has no role in anything "important"  not in weapons inspections, 
in the Iraqi political process, in major reconstruction decisions, nor in 
peacekeeping (where a multinational "coalition of the willing" is being 
assembled). Instead, as George Bush said, the "vital role" of the U.N. is 
easily defined: "That means food. That means medicine. That means aid." Or, 
as Richard Perle said even more openly, in an op-ed shortly after the war 
began titled "Thank God for the death of the U.N.," "The 'good works' part 
will survive, the low-risk peacekeeping bureaucracies will remain, the 
chatterbox on the Hudson will continue to bleat." No longer content with a 
system where nominally the U.N. is the ultimate authority but the United

<p>States dominates it by coercion and bribery, the Bush administration wants 
explicit recognition that the U.N. should play only the roles allowed to it 
by the United States.
<p>An example from history helps to illuminate the fundamental principle 
regarding the sanctions. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, one of
the first things it did was try to set up a puppet regime composed of 
Kuwaitis to rule the country as a satellite of Iraq. It would actually have 
withdrawn most of its army had that regime gotten any international 
recognition. Instead, the sanctions that were levied at U.S. insistence 
embargoed not only Iraq's oil sales but Kuwait's. Kuwaiti oil was not to be 
sold so that an illegitimate regime could not plunder Kuwait's oil wealth 
for the benefit of the Iraqi government. Those sanctions were indefensible 
for reasons that don't apply today, including the almost complete 
termination of food imports into Iraq (although food was technically 
allowed under UN Security Council Resolution 666, in practice virtually 
none got in). The principle, however, was sound.

<p>Today, the United States is willing to (partially) withdraw after it 
installs its own puppet regime (one that will presumably have more 
independence than the one Iraq tried to install, but will still be 
subservient to U.S. dictates). It also wants to plunder Iraq's oil wealth 
for its own political purposes and for the benefit of U.S. corporations.

<p>This is reason enough to keep the sanctions on until there is a legitimate 
Iraqi government. This can only happen if U.S. and other "coalition" forces 
withdraw, there is a multinational U.N. peacekeeping force with no 
participation from any of the aggressor nations, and the Iraqis are given a 
genuine chance to exercise their right to self-determination.
