<p>"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa." 

<p>For George Bush and his lieutenants those are just "16 words." That's what national security adviser Condoleezza Rice kept telling the Sunday morning news shows.

<p>The problem for Rice and other Bushies is that those 16 words betrayed American servicemen and women and their families and friends.

<p>The president's claim was wrong. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency knew it was wrong.

<p>That matters. Just like it matters that we can't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Just like Bush's "bring them on" taunt about terrorist attacks matters.

<p>It all matters to folks like Audrey Carl.

<p>Carl lost her husband, Army Cpl. Richard Carl, a medical specialist stationed at Fort Carson, when his helicopter crashed in the Tigris River. Cpl. Carl, who was posthumously promoted to sergeant, died May 9, eight days after President Bush officially declared the major fighting over.

<p>"I didn't really believe we should have been going to Iraq in the first place," Audrey Carl said. "I still feel that way."

</table></font>She is a 23-year-old widow. She has two small children - 3-year-old Ealy Ann and 20-month-old Dominick. She knows very little of the sloppy intelligence that has come to light recently. She stopped reading the paper or watching the news after her husband died.

<p>"I didn't want to see, because I didn't want to know," Carl said Monday in a telephone interview from her home in Idaho. "I didn't want any more pain."

<p>The extra hurt proved inevitable. It came with the realization that no weapons of mass destruction have yet been found and that the administration may have embellished intelligence reports to justify the war.

<p>"It disturbs me," Carl said. "It makes me upset that my husband may have gone to war for no reason."

<p>Or for reasons that were partly trumped up.

<p>The issue is not whether Saddam Hussein was a murderous dictator. He was.

<p>What counts here is that more than 200 Americans have died in Iraq, and more die every week. What counts here is how the administration justifies those casualties to the people who feel those losses directly. You don't lie about that. You don't twist the truth. You don't exaggerate. Not if you respect the people you put in harm's way.

<p>Audrey Carl believes George Bush is a decent man.

<p>"If I was president," she said, "I wouldn't have been in Iraq. But he acted on his morals. He wanted to help those people."

<p>So did her husband.

<p>"My husband died doing what he loved," Carl explained. "He died helping people. I don't think it was totally in vain."

<p>At the same time, Carl struggles to explain to herself what her husband died for.

<p>Answering that question is important for her and every other survivor of Iraqi war casualties. It will become critical for the rest of the country as the "liberation" of Iraq bogs down into a years-long guerrilla war where troops die standing in line to buy soft drinks.

<p>Right now, this looks more like Palestine than paradise.

<p>That's what makes all the shuck and jive about "16 words" and "bring them on" so reckless and insensitive.

<p>Richard Carl did his duty. He and three other soldiers were rescuing an 11-year-old Iraqi girl when their helicopter hit a power line and crashed.

<p>They deserve better than propaganda that may have overstated the threat to the country they served. The same applies to everyone who has died or been wounded. It applies to anyone in the military.

<p>People should get upset when they hear that Vice President Dick Cheney pressured mid-level CIA operatives to juice up intelligence reports on Iraq.

<p>They should worry when a State Department employee testifies that he felt pressured to change a report about chemical weapons in Iraq.

<p>They should be troubled when they see polls that show many Americans now incorrectly believe Iraqis helped hijack the planes used in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

<p>They should recoil when their leaders dismiss their false claims as meaningless and invite terrorists to bring on attacks.

<p>Ignoring this stuff cheapens the sacrifices of all servicemen and servicewomen. It breaches an essential trust.

<p>If the president wants to know what people in the line of fire think of his cowboy act, he can consult a new survey of more than 3,700 readers of the military newspaper Army Times.

<p>Asked about Bush's "bring them on" comment, 61 percent said that "it was irresponsible and unnecessarily placed the lives of U.S. troops in even greater danger."

<p>As for the actual import of those 16 little words, the administration may consult the widows of American servicemen.

<p>"I gave as much as I could to this country," said Audrey Carl. "I'm done."
