<p>"People say to me, 'You are not the Vietnamese. You have no jungles 
and swamps,' " Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is quoted as telling a 
University of Warwick researcher six months ago. "I reply, 'Let our cities be 
our swamps and our buildings our jungles.'‚''
<P>How did the sands of the Iraqi desert turn so suddenly into a quagmire? How 
did an Iraqi military that we pictured in fixed positions on Kuwaiti border or 
arrayed along "highways of death" (as in 1991) awaiting incineration by Apache 
helicopters and F-16s suddenly morph into an incipient guerrilla force?
<P>As the nascent Chinese Communist movement fought for their lives against 
Chiang Kai-shek in 1928, Mao Zedong wrote "The Struggle in the Qinggang 
Mountains." By doing so, he bequeathed to the modern world the mother-of-all 
handbooks on how weaker military forces can paralyze, if not defeat, far 
superior ones. Mao's answer to conventional pitched battles was a "mobile" and 
"protracted" form of warfare that won through harassment. And, although far 
weaker and less well-equipped, the Red Army did ultimately outlast both the 
invading Japanese army and the Nationalist government.
<P>The ingredients of this new kind of "asymmetrical warfare" were: 
decentralization, surprise, agility and deception. Above all, counseled Mao, 
weaker forces should avoid major engagements and settle instead with a victory 
of attrition by means of repeated, small-scale raids.
<P>Mao was inspired by the classical Chinese strategist Sun Zi, whose ancient 
classic, "The Art of War," first codified the basic tenets of guerrilla war 
more than two millennia ago.
<P>Counseling against direct confrontation, Mao reminded his followers that a 
weaker army should "strike only when positively certain that the enemy's 
situation, the terrain, and popular support are all in our favor and not in 
his."
<P>Mao's triumph in China helped proliferate an almost mythic legacy of 
"people's war," one that Americans confronted in an agonizing way in Indochina 
as we fought against a convert Maoist strategy, General Vo Nguyen Giap, who 
led the Vietnam People's Army (NVA) and the National Liberation Front (NLF).
<P>Such a strategy is precisely what Iraqi supporters of Saddam Hussein have 
begun to use. But what may prove to be even more disruptive of coalition plans 
are Iraqi intentions to engage in urban guerrilla warfare -- even suicide 
bombing -- as U.S. and U.K. troops finally enter their cities and start trying 
"to build a peace." An indiscriminate urban counterinsurgency effort could 
prove as compromising to America's image as the campaigns to "win the hearts 
and minds of the people" in rural Vietnam did decades ago. As Sun Zi warned: 
"The worst policy is to besiege cities."
<P>Body counts, B-52 strikes, wounded GIs in medi-vac choppers, downed 
helicopter gunships surrounded by AK-47 toting peasants, "Five O'clock Follies-
like" Centcom briefings, anti-war demonstrations, troop escalations, and a 
repetition of official expressions that the war is still "on track," all have 
a haunting ring.
<P>If over the last few days, U.S. military planners have come to view 
"irregular forces" like the Fedayeen Saddam and the Special Republican Guard 
commandos as "a major annoyance" -- the "equivalent of the black pajama Viet 
Cong," as one senior U.S. intelligence official put it -- we can only wonder 
what kind of an annoyance such insurgents will be to the process of "nation 
building."
<P>Few countries have ever welcomed foreign air strikes or invasion and 
history is replete with occasions when nationalism trumped a people's loathing 
of dictatorship. No greater example exists than Hitler's invasion of Russia. 
Despite Stalin's tyrannical rule, Russians fought heroically to repel the 
German advance.
<P>We know that Saddam Hussein is student of Stalin, but it now looks as if he 
and Tariq Aziz have been reading a little Mao on the side. And it is a 
stunning lapse that as it planned to topple him by military means, the Bush 
administration did not understand that Saddam would inevitably turn to 
guerrilla warfare fired by nationalism to save his Arab dignity, if not his 
country and himself. As the Washington Post has reported, intelligence-agency 
warnings of a possible guerrilla war in Iraq fell on deaf ears in the White 
House.
<P>Did Bush strategists view Aziz as such a propagandist that his words should 
be utterly discounted? It is difficult to believe, especially since short of 
instant occupation or abject surrender - options that few thought the Iraqi 
government would accept -- Saddam Hussein had no other realistic options other 
than to borrow a leaf from Chairman Mao and engage in urban guerrilla warfare.
