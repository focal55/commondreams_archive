<p> After listening to the double talk coming out of Baghdad and Washington this week, I found myself asking: How is it that America so often gets entangled in messy foreign affairs? I found an answer in the buildup to this weekend's National Basketball Association all-star game.</P><!-- /Summary -->
<P>I've always been mildly fascinated by the pretensions of American sports and what they tell us about the impulses that govern the country. How is it that the British Empire was able to export (or impose) its culture -- specifically, games such as soccer, cricket and field hockey -- while America, for all its advantages in modern communications and global reach, hasn't managed to convince the rest of the world that baseball or basketball is worth pursuing?</P>
<P>Of course, Britain had a physical empire, while the United States has largely operated as an absentee landlord. But there's something else, too, something I saw while taking unwitting part in an experiment to make the world safe for the NBA.</P>
<P>About 10 years ago, I was invited, along with other European-based journalists, to the all-star NBA weekend in Phoenix. At the time, the NBA was trying to establish a foothold in Europe. Its dream team, with Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, had just mesmerized the world at the Barcelona Olympics, and the world swooned to the soundtrack of rap along with the fresh and innovative marketing of the game and its stars.</P>
<P>It was an eye opener for us naive, somewhat awestruck European journalists, accustomed to the &#34;take it or leave it&#34; attitude of professional sports in Europe, to hear NBA commissioner David Stern and his people talk of their sport in such commercial terms. We smiled as missionary publicists spoke of the NBA as a brand competing for its market share of the entertainment pie. To us, sport was an intrinsic part of society, not a consumer good to be bought or sold.</P>
<P>Despite our misgivings, we were impressed with the NBA machinery. Nothing was left to chance; every aspect of the game was micromanaged. Even basketball arenas were gleaming temples to the competitive impulses of capitalism. Was this, we wondered, the future of sport?</P>
<P>We knew there was a dark underside -- that beyond the gloss was a perennial three-way squabble among players, owners and the NBA over money. We had heard stories of the brand wars between Nike and Adidas, and the inducements they used to lure high school and college basketball athletes to endorse their shoes and attend their training camps.</P>
<P>But for all its sins, the NBA was a creative force, a powerful outlet for inner-city expression. It spoke not just for black and underprivileged America, but inspired kids as far away as Zaire and China.</P>
<P>You hoped that where soccer and cricket had conquered the world from the playing fields of Britain's private schools, the courts of America's inner city would shape the new world sports order.</P>
<P>But that did not happen. The NBA did not travel well. Where soccer was imposed on local cultures, the game took root because its regional accents were always allowed to flourish within a universal set of rules. The British might have invented the game, but they didn't insist that everyone play it the way they do.</P>
<P>That's why the English Premier League has a different rhythm from that of Japan's J-League. Italy's Serie A has a different vibe from the Dutch Eredivise. From Europe to Latin America to Africa, soccer is a diverse sport within the same game.</P>
<P>Not so the NBA. It wanted to control every aspect of its operations wherever it went; it enforced its copyrights with the ruthless zeal of medieval religious zealots. It was intolerant and dismissive of how the game was played outside the United States. Its dream teams began to seem like an an air force softening up the target territory for the NBA's ground force of marketing personnel that descended on local basketball leagues around the world.</P>
<P>And that's probably why -- despite carpet-bombing Asia, Africa and Latin America with NBA-approved hamburgers, running shoes and soda pop -- soccer remains the universal game. It is hard to imagine that Houston Rockets center Yao Ming and the galaxy of global stars in the NBA will ever sell the rest of the world on basketball. Because the suspicion remains: As entertaining as it is, the NBA is not a sport; it is an expensive commercial for its sponsors.</P>
<P>Which, in a way, sums up so much about America. In sports or in politics, he who pays the piper calls the tune. That's fine -- until your audience decides they're not buying the song.
