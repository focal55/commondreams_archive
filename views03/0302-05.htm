<p>Dissent isn't easy 
        these days. You're branded unpatriotic for questioning an unelected 
        president's rush to war, and dismissed as insignificant even when you 
number in the millions.<p>It gets much 
        worse. If you work in an American university, you could be 
        blacklisted, harassed and even lose your job for questioning the Bush 
        Administration's conservative pro-war agenda. Thanks to a small 
        number of deep-pocket groups with close ties to the government, 
        campuses have been pummeled with a right-wing political agenda; one 
        stated goal is to <A href="http://hnn.us/articles/1244.html" target="_new">replace
         liberal-minded professors</A> (found to be &quot;short on 
        patriotism&quot; or failing to teach that civilization itself &quot;is
         best exemplified in the West and indeed in America&quot;) with more 
        politically correct conservatives.<p>If you're a human 
        rights activist in the States, things get even bleaker. Of the 10,000 
        who demonstrated in Fort Benning, Georgia last November to shut down 
        what they call a terrorist training camp on US soil - the School of 
        the Americas, renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation (SOA/WHINSEC) - 96 peacefully crossed the forbidden line 
        into the facility and were <A href="http://www.soaw.org/new/pressrelease.php?id=55" target="_new">charged
         with civil disobedience</A>. Those arrested included a 
        priest, a reverend, Catholic nuns and veterans; as of now, 83 have 
        been adjudicated, many receiving federal prison terms. Who says we 
        don't have political prisoners in America?<p>But of course, 
        dissent comes at a high price everywhere. At the infamous 2001 Genoa 
        G8 summit, the world was stunned when a young protestor was shot dead 
        by police, but only recently did the rest of the ugly story emerge. 
        In one especially vicious event, Italian police raided a school being 
        used as a temporary dormitory by international demonstrators and 
        independent media. Claiming two petrol bombs had been found in the 
        school and that an occupant had tried to stab an officer, police 
        charged into the school and proceeded to smash windows, computers and 
        heads in a gruesome attack that injured 72 occupants, many seriously. 
        Bystanders kept outside the school during the prolonged raid reported 
        hearing spine-chilling screams and then seeing the battered bodies 
        carried out on stretchers.<p>What happened 
        later is significant. Of the 93 inside the school arrested by the 
        police that night, all were later released without charge. Then just 
        last January, a full year and a half after the brutality, it emerged 
        that the <A href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2636647.stm" target="_new">Italian
         police had in fact planted the petrol bombs</A> at the 
        school, and the officer who claimed to have been stabbed had in fact lied.<p>In other words, 
        the Italian police had fabricated evidence against dissenters in 
        order to justify beating them to a pulp.<p>We could be 
        heading that direction in the States. The proposed Domestic Security 
        Enhancement Act of 2003, a.k.a. Patriot Act II, would grant the 
        government sweeping new powers for surveillance, wiretapping, 
        detention and criminal prosecution. Court appointed limits on police 
        infiltration and disruption of dissident political groups would be 
        terminated, and the government would be exempted from disclosing 
        information on individuals detained in terrorism investigations; in 
        other words, as the Bush Administration's &quot;you're with us or 
        with the enemy&quot; mentality seeps down into the domestic arena and 
        dissent becomes increasingly equated with terrorism, it will be 
        easier to &quot;disappear&quot; political opponents.<p>Despite the risks, 
        dissent is on the rise and from some unexpected sources. In the UK, 
        an unprecedented 20% of reservists called up for military action have 
        either ignored the order or claimed exemption. Stateside, a group of 
        soldiers, parents of soldiers and Congress members have filed a 
        lawsuit challenging the authority of George W. Bush to launch a 
        military invasion of Iraq without a congressional declaration. 
        Similarly, a bill making its way through the House of Representatives 
        (House Joint Resolution 20) would repeal Bush's authorization to use 
        force against Iraq. Over 120 cities in the US have passed resolutions 
        against a war in Iraq.<p>And dissent today 
        is not without its own creativity - or humor. In an ironic twist, a 
        delegation of politicians, academics and scientists from abroad 
        recently descended on the US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological 
        Center in Maryland to search for Weapons of Mass Destruction. Across 
        the Atlantic, German relatives of US Defense Secretary Donald 
        Rumsfeld castigated his warmongering and publicly disowned him.<p>But those pushing 
        for war have some creative ideas of their own. Last month, it was big 
        news when ten Central and Eastern European nations issued a statement 
        supporting the Bush drive to attack Iraq. Less well reported, 
        however, was the fact that none other than Bruce Jackson (former US 
        Defense Department official and weapons manufacturer executive) had 
        helped draft the controversial statement and pushed to have it 
        released. And of course, the final pretext for the last Gulf war - 
        reports that Iraqi soldiers had ripped Kuwaiti babies from their 
        incubators and left them to die on hospital floors - was later 
        exposed as a downright lie, fabricated to silence dissent.<p>As the CIA says, 
        it's the &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; in action: propaganda repeated 
        so often and by such credible sources it becomes conventional wisdom.<p>Many of us can see 
        past the lies. We're horrified that nuclear devices, depleted 
        uranium, and Orwellian weaponry such as microwave technology and 
        weather modification could be used against civilians in the name of 
        somehow creating peace. We're appalled by Rumsfeld's plan to ditch 
        the Chemical Weapons Convention, thus allowing American forces to <A href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0302-03.htm">use
         biochemical weapons against Iraqi troops and civilians <I>proactively</I></A>.
         We're sickened at the prospect of sending our service members into 
        this bottomless pit.<p>The ultimate irony 
        of course is that the hawkish politicians leading us into this mess 
        are the true dissenters. Public opinion internationally opposes an 
        attack on Iraq, but the handful of men who have seized power 
        apparently disagree. And everyone knows Iraq is just their first stop.<p>Given the stakes, 
        it is far less dangerous for us to dissent than to accept the alternative.
