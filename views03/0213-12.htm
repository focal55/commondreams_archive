<p>Jean Kumler was baking cookies when I called her at her home in Cincinnati the other day. Peanut butter, chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, sugar cookies.<p> The cookies are to be sold at a fund-raiser tomorrow night to support Cincinnati's organized anti-war effort. When it's over, Kumler and about 35 other people will pile into a bus and ride 12 hours to New York, where they'll take part in Saturday's anti-war rally near the United Nations. <p> The polls say that more than 60 percent of Americans favor a war against Iraq. But the steady round of protests that are taking place here and abroad prove that many people oppose it. This Saturday, along with the thousands who're expected in New York, they'll be marching in Johannesburg, protesting in Great Britain and reading anti-war poetry in Vermont. Meanwhile, the heads of Germany's churches are criticizing the United States' rush to war, and an Irish group is trying to round up Westerners who're willing to go to Iraq and form a human shield for the Iraqis.<p> Jean Kumler's opposition to this war grew out of her long family history with the military. Her older brother served in the Korean conflict. Her younger brother served in the Army during the Vietnam War. Jean, 64, served in the Navy in the late '50s and married a Navy man, who did active duty in Vietnam.<p> "My government told me at the time that we needed to be in Vietnam, that there was logic and reasoning to it." But when the facts about that war came out later, she felt she'd been betrayed.<p> She and her husband had three sons and a daughter. One son, Gregory, followed his parents into the Navy. Just before the Persian Gulf War started, he was sent to Saudi Arabia, and he was there when the rockets were being sent over. He spent 10 months there before returning home with the triumphant U.S. troops in June 1991.<p> But six months later he was in a Veterans Administration hospital, suffering from a series of mysterious ailments that caused fluid to surround his heart and lungs. Kumler categorizes her son's illness with a large assortment of otherwise unexplained ailments suffered by thousands of other Gulf War veterans that are generally referred to as "Gulf War Syndrome." He died in April, 1992. <p> "All I have left of him is a flag," she told me.<p> Two weeks ago, she checked herself into the V.A. hospital in Cincinnati, suffering from post traumatic stress brought on by the current threat of war. "This is like the nightmare with my son all over again," she says. "I watch the news. We've got another President Bush, and Cheney's there, and Colin Powell. I'm watching the same thing over again. And they didn't take care of the last people. Nobody needs to go through this again for nothing."<p> Powell, who as the country's top military man oversaw the Gulf War, later denied that the illnesses of thousands of Gulf War veterans had anything to do with their military service. Now he's preparing to send another group of soldiers against a threat that's questionable at best.<p> On Saturday, Kumler will stand with thousands of others who believe the war the Bush administration is pushing so hard for is a mistake. She hopes her presence will send a message that not all Americans are over-anxious cowboys.<p> I was reading a magazine article the other day that remarked on how feeble the anti-war effort is, how it lacks the momentum of the Vietnam War protests, how Americans have been intimidated into silence by the fear of being branded as unpatriotic. But it was wrong. The tens of thousands of war protesters who've made their feelings known on the streets of Washington, on college campuses, in parks and public meetings, and in silent sidewalk vigils attended by only a handful of souls prove that, with all its bluster and all of its alleged evidence supporting a war, the government can never fool all the people at the same time. And unlike the Vietnam protests, which took place during a full-blown war, these are happening before a single bomb has been dropped.<p> I don't know if the protests will be enough to stop the war, but they say a lot about the common sense and conviction of the American people.
