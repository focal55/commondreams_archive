<p>President Bush proclaimed in his State of the Union Address last month 
that the United States of America will "defend the peace and confound the 
designs of evil men," referring to disarming Saddam Hussein. He assured the 
American public that if it comes to war, "We will fight in a just cause and by 
just means." Bush ended the speech by asking for God's guidance. (He repeated 
that theme Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, seeking 
guidance through "a testing time for our country.")
<P>Because the president appeared to be referencing "just war" criteria that 
have been articulated by the Christian Church for almost 2,000 years, it is 
important to look closely at whether they will be met in a war against Iraq.
<P>Just cause: First of all, is there just cause? Traditionally this has 
referred to a defensive response to grave and certain harm to the nation. The 
Bush administration has not made the case that either Iraq's capacity or 
intention to use weapons of mass destruction is likely, much less certain. 
There is no more adequate evidence of an imminent attack of a grave nature now 
than there was five years ago. There are no proven high-level Iraqi links to 
al Qaeda and international terrorism targeting the United States.
<P>Last resort: Second, are we at the point where going to war is truly a 
matter of last resort? Clearly not. We have containment and deterrence of a 
regime that has been effective for 12 years. Political and military sanctions 
can be continued -- although I would hope we'd lift the economic embargo that 
has been partially responsible for a doubling of the death rate for small 
children in Iraq since 1991, according to UNICEF. Iraq is militarily 
surrounded and contained. There are U.S.-patrolled no-fly zones. Surveillance 
and intelligence-gathering is at a high pitch. U.N. weapon inspectors are 
operating throughout the country. If we can continue negotiating with a more 
dangerous North Korea, why not with Iraq?
<P>Legitimate authority: Third, does President Bush have legitimate authority 
to act? The majority of Americans are against the war without the backing of 
the United Nations, and Vietnam should have taught us not to prosecute a war 
without the backing of the American people. The President claims that last 
November's U.N. resolution gives him all the authority needed for a war 
against Iraq, but that is not the way a majority of the Security Council now 
see it. To prosecute a war without U.N. support and without the backing of the 
American public would be folly at best and a disaster at worse.
<P>Probability of success: Fourth, is there a probability of success? America 
is strong militarily, and Iraq is not, so we may well be able to defeat their 
armed forces within a couple of months. But this criterion fails when we 
consider how long we would have to be tied down in Iraq in order to win the 
peace. An article by James Fallows in the November issue of Atlantic Monthly 
estimated Iraq would in effect have to become our fifty-first state, with a 
huge humanitarian crisis, need for broad economic reconstruction and call for 
some 50,000-75,000 U.S. troops for many years to restore civil order under 
fire and to defend Iraq's borders. There would be continuing casualties, costs 
would probably run in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and that would have 
a dramatic impact on providing services to U.S. citizens.
<P>Test of proportionality: Fifth, is it likely that greater evil will be 
created by going to war than by not? If Iraq does have weapons of mass 
destruction, would not this new war run great risk of triggering the very use 
of weapons of mass destruction that we are so desperately trying to prevent? 
Moreover, is it not likely that such a war will infuriate much of the Muslim 
world and solidify them against us?
<P>Certainly a war against Iraq could stimulate more terrorism against this 
country and its citizens rather than less. The world becomes more dangerous if 
the United States is seen as an aggressor nation engaged in pre-emptive war. 
Why should everyone else not abandon the U.N. charter to pursue their own pre-
emptive strikes where they feel at risk, from Kashmir to North Korea?
<P>And concentrating our resources on a war in Iraq could well mean that al 
Qaeda and related terrorist groups, along with countries like North Korea, are 
emboldened as we have less resources and less attention to pay to those 
potentially greater threats.
<P>No civilian targets: Sixth and finally, would innocent men, women and 
children be spared in a war against Iraq? The United States has precision 
smart bombs, but what if we end up in door-to-door fighting in Baghdad? What 
about civilian death and suffering based on destruction of Iraq's 
infrastructure, piled on top of civilian death and suffering under the 
sanctions and embargo of the last 12 years? This is still a devastated country 
that we would in effect be finishing off, with a huge impact on its civilian 
population. U.N. estimates are of 500,000 civilian casualties, directly and 
indirectly due to a war, with some 2 million civilians displaced.
<P>"People of good will may differ on how to apply just war norms in 
particular cases, especially when events are moving rapidly and the facts are 
not altogether clear," as the U.S. Catholic Bishops recently put it. Yet, here 
it appears that none of the traditional requirements is met for a war against 
Iraq, and they all must be satisfied for a war to be just.
<P>So what are we left with? Diplomacy, inspections, intelligence-gathering, 
sanctions, containment, international solidarity, humanitarian assistance to 
the civilian population of Iraq, vigilance and patience. Abraham Lincoln 
warned us that right makes might, and not the other way around.
<P>Basic moral and spiritual values are the lifeblood of this country, and 
without them the American way of life itself is in grave peril. We must not go 
to war with Iraq.
