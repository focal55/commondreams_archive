<p>While vacationing at his father's seaside home in Kennebunkport, Maine last week, GW Bush tried his hand at riding a Segway Transporter, those innovative, two-wheeled electric vehicles developed by Dean Kamen.  Unfortunately for the ex-Texas governor and resident of the White House, the highly intuitive Segway was apparently too intuitive. A photographer captured a rapid series of photos of Mister Bush falling headlong over the top of the gyroscopically-stabilized machine.
 
<p>Having ridden the Segway myself and watched dozens of others from young to old easily master the novelty from New Hampshire, I wondered how it could be that the most powerful politician in the world could fall off it.  Then I recalled my own experience with the Segway last year in Oklahoma City at the Department of Energy's National Clean Cities Conference.  Dean Kamen, himself, was on-hand to demonstrate the device and address the audience of civil servants, energy executives and transportation developers. 
 
<p>It was the next to the last day of the conference when the delegates got to try their hands at piloting the machine formerly code-named "Ginger."  A Segway employee was on hand to briefly instruct each rider on how to operate the battery-powered machine.  
 
<p>Twist the handle on the left to go left. To go right, twist it to the right.  Differential motors in the two wheels cause the machine to pivot clockwise or counter clockwise.  A green, smiling face indicates you have a full charge in the battery pack.  With the employee steadying the Segway, you step up on to the platform, taking hold of the handlebar.  
 
<p>To go forward, the employee coached, imagine yourself taking a step forward. To stop, think stop. To go backwards, think backwards.
 
<p>Sure enough, almost as if by magic, I thought about moving forward and the Segway instantly responded!  The further forward I leaned the faster the two-wheeler would go. 
 
<p>The top speed on these demonstration models had been limited to about 7 mph. The commercial version is set at about 12.5 mph.
 
<p>When I wanted to stop, I just thought "stop" and it did.  Back up? Same thing.  It was incredible!  And so darned easy!  Here were a bunch of 40 and 50 year-old bureaucrats, marketers, reporters and engineers zipping around the open conference hall like Gen-Xer's on skateboards!  I don't recall seeing a single person fall off the machine.  This thing is just so much fun that there has to be a market for it and Segway is working overtime to make that happen. So far, they've succeeded in convincing 38 states and the District of Columbia to legalize their operation on sidewalks. Ironically, Oakland, California wants to ban them entirely. 
 
<p>Which brings me back to the Kennebunkport photo op.  There was an attractive young lady in shorts instructing Mister Bush on the nuances of Segway operation. A few moments later GW is falling over the top of the machine.  Presumably, he eventually mastered the device because there's also a photo of him tooling around on it, all upright and presidential.  But it was that one botched moment in time, with cameras snapping away as they did when then-President Gerald Ford stumbled coming down the steps of Air Force One, that may come to symbolize more than any other moment in the residency of George W. Bush, even that notoriously political and premature photo op on the USS Kennedy. When presented with a machine so stable, so intuitive, so easy to operate, GW blows it.  And I'd guess he blew it because it is so intuitive to operate. You don't use brute force. You use muscle movements so subtle that you don't even notice them.  You think where you want to go.  
 
<p>Now I am not implying that America is a Segway. It isn't.  It's a big, lumbering semi-trailer truck of a machine that takes man-handling at times and doesn't turn on a dime. But exercising leadership in the world is a lot like mastering a Segway.  You work with the machine, not against it.  You will it to go a certain direction, you don't shove it that way.  You understand the machine's nuances and take advantage of them.
 
<p>One of the more memorable moments of that conference in Oklahoma City was watching Dean Kamen addressing the delegates while maneuvering effortless around the stage on a Segway. Backwards, forwards, left and right he turned with imperceptible movement, speaking passionately about invention and transforming the world. Here was a man with a vision of getting people out of their energy-hungry cars and trucks and back on the neglected sidewalks of America where we can interact again instead of retreating inside our $30,000 steel and glass cocoons, an America moving on less energy than it takes for a human to walk.  
 
<p>Say what you might about the impracticality of Kamen's invention or his vision, but it's an America that I'd like to live in rather than the one Mister Bush seems intend on dragging us into.
