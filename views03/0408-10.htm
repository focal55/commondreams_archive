<p>Ordinary citizens suspecting economic motives behind the Iraq war are 
told that the time has passed for debate, and it's now incumbent upon 
all patriots to fall in line behind the President and "support the 
troops!" But what about corporate citizens poised to profit from the 
sacrifices of our troops? Shouldn't it also be incumbent on them to 
support the troops?

<p>I humbly propose the "Corporate Patriot Act," which would require all 
corporations financially benefiting directly or indirectly from the 
Iraq war to donate all profits to the families of the brave American 
troops who've made the supreme sacrifice, those troops injured or 
disabled as a result of the war, and lastly, the American taxpayers 
who've financed the war from our national treasury.

<p>Corporations have, after all, been endowed by law with all the rights of
flesh-and-blood Americans. With those rights presumably come 
responsibilities. And what self-respecting, patriotic American 
corporation would wish to profit from our troops' sacrifices and our 
taxpayers' expenditures? The nation of Iraq, including its oil fields, 
has due to loss of American lives in this war become -- as Lincoln said 
at Gettysburg -- "hallowed" and "consecrated" ground. Certainly the 
patriotic captains of industry at all-American companies like 
Exxon-Mobil, Halliburton, Raytheon, Lockheed-Martin, and Bechtel, will, 
upon critical reflection, disown profits from serendipitously presented 
business opportunities for which they shed neither blood nor dollars. 
I'm sure of it.

<p>To profit from those sacrifices is to desecrate our flag, dishonor our 
troops, and blasphemize our national honor. Corporate Americans cannot 
unjustly enrich themselves off the flesh-and-blood Americans who die and
pay for war. We have publicized the costs; we cannot privatize the 
benefits. No corporation can accept what amounts to "blood money."

<p>Passage of the Corporate Patriot Act will be an elixir, pulling citizens 
of all political stripes together in unprecedented unity and purpose in 
this time of war without end. To date we've been deeply divided; some 
claiming this is a "war for oil," while others such as Donald Rumsfeld 
vehemently and categorically denying that. Passage of this proposed 
legislation will nullify that debate.

<p>The Corporate Patriot Act will also help right many past wrongs. History
proves that, sadly, corporations have been among our most unpatriotic 
citizens, profiting time and again from the sacrifices of our troops.

<p>No American expressed this more pointedly than Marine Corps Major 
General Smedley Butler, referred to as "that Marine of Marines" and by 
Theodore Roosevelt as "the finest fighting man in the armed forces." 
Said this Marine whose personal patriotism takes a back seat to no one: 
<i>"War, like any other racket, pays high dividends to the very few. But 
what does it profit the masses? ... The cost of operations is always 
transferred to the people who do not profit. ... But there is a way to 
stop this racket. ... It can be effectively smashed only by taking the 
profit out of war."
</i>
<p>General Butler was the son of a wealthy Republican Congressman (an 
unfathomable concept by today's standards: only 1 in 535 current Members
of Congress has a child in military service, and most of the current 
Administration members declined the opportunity to serve their country 
in Vietnam and elsewhere) and one of only 19 Americans to receive the 
Congressional Medal of Honor TWICE. Indeed, he would have been the only 
THREE time recipient in American history, but for a regulatory glitch.

<p>To "support the troops" of the War To End All Wars by paying the 
promised veteran's bonus, General Butler said, "I believe in making Wall
Street pay for it - taking Wall Street by the throat and shaking it up."

<p>Regarding the American flag-flying oil company operations Butler's 
Marines protected in China, he said, "why don't those damned oil 
companies fly their own flags on their personal property - maybe a flag 
with a gas pump on it." Few listened. The corporate profiteering he 
condemned unfortunately continues, and today as our troops fall in 
battle in the streets of Baghdad, corporate lobbyists are jockeying into
position for billions in revenue which have already begun flowing.

<p>Congress has overwhelmingly passed a resolution expressing its 
unqualified support of the troops. Surely there will be no shortage of 
Congressional patriots willing to ensure that corporations do likewise. 
Let the "spoils of war" go to those who earned them. God bless America!
