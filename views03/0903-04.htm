<p>WE LOVE TO SAY kids are not stupid. This is a mediocre moment to find out if that is true. American families are in the process of throwing 48 million schoolchildren back into the public schools. That is a lot of fry floating in the pond. The good news is that their chances of growing to maturity are significantly better than those of the fish. For instance, female lobsters produce about 10,000 eggs, out of which less than 1 percent grow to adulthood. A much higher percent of children eventually will graduate from the nation's high schools.

<p>That is small comfort for parents who send their children off to school under clearly decreasing odds of success and a clearly declining return on our investment. We love to say kids are our future. Based on what we are investing in them, we are not expecting much.

<p>Not a day has gone by in the last two weeks without yet another story about school cutbacks and program elimination. In Massachusetts and the rest of the nation, schools in cities and suburbs are slashing funds for music, theater, foreign languages, school newspapers, and field trips. These are the kinds of things that day by day create cultured human beings, not just standardized-test automatons. Extracurricular activities that keep youth off the streets, even sports, have been decimated.


<p>In Winthrop, the district has shut its school libraries. In the state and across the nation, school bus services have been slashed. In Boston, school officials have gone back and forth between eliminating and rehiring teachers. In wealthier districts, parents are raising thousands of dollars for the activities that provide culture and the protection of knowing where their kids are. As for low-income districts, the larvae are left to swim amongst the predators of idle time, crime, cable, and copulation.

<p>Perhaps the hope by our more cynical noninvestors in education is that we dumb down the kids so thoroughly that they do not question the investments elsewhere. At the same time school administrators are howling, the last nine months of buildup, war, and controlling the Iraqi people will cost nearly $60 billion, according to the Pentagon. The continuing occupation of Iraq is costing $4 billion a month.

<p>The coordinator of the occupation, Paul Bremer, said last week that Iraq will need as much as an additional $100 billion from the international community to rebuild the infrastructure. Many analysts say the rebuilding will take much more, from $100 billion to $600 billion, according to the Brookings Institution and the American Academy of Sciences. Fresh drinking water alone would cost $16 billion over the next four years. Bremer told The Washington Post: "We have a noble task before us. It's difficult, it's costly, but it's absolutely achievable."

<p>Everyone says teaching our children is a noble task, but the costs of the occupation are now at a level where it makes any claims of caring about public schools a joke. Halliburton, the oil and soldier services company once run by Vice President Dick Cheney, already has scored $1.7 billion in no-bid, no-ceiling contracts off the war. That would fund the Boston public schools for three years.

<p>The $60 billion cost of the invasion and its immediate aftermath dwarfs the $36 billion American schools were able to spend on construction in 2001. While the war-related work allowed Halliburton to post a profit of $26 million in the second quarter of this year after nearly $500 million of losses last year, the cumulative debt of the nation's school districts rose to $202 billion in 2001.

<p>If the cost of rebuilding Iraq surpasses $411 billion, that will exceed spending for all the nation's public school students in 2001. All for a war that began with lies, ended with the discovery of no weapons of mass destruction and no proof of a revamped nuclear weapons program, and is continuing with the chaos of car bombings and sniper attacks. The commitment to rebuild Iraq is so serious that the White House is giving Bechtel a contract boost of $350 million, sending that company's war work over $1 billion.

<p>As for the rebuilding of education, President Bush's vaunted Leave No Child Behind program, which promises students that they can transfer out of poorly performing schools, is so underfunded that in Chicago there are only 1,000 seats for the 240,000 students who could qualify. Less than half of 1 percent can qualify.

<p>That last figure makes me want to take back what I said at the top. A lobster larva indeed may have a better chance of reaching maturity than does a Chicago public school student of reaching a decent school. We can only throw our fry out there for so long before they realize that. We say our children are not stupid. If that is true, then we should not be surprised if one day they come leaping back out of the water, looking to chomp on whoever threw them in.
