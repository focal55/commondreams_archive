<p> There is little that those of us who oppose the coming war with Iraq can now 
do to prevent it. George Bush has staked his credibility on the project; he has 
mid-term elections to consider, oil supplies to secure and a flagging war on terror 
to revive. Our voices are as little heeded in the White House as the singing of 
the birds. 
<P>Our role is now, perhaps, confined to the modest but necessary task of demonstrating 
the withdrawal of our consent, while seeking to undermine the moral confidence 
which could turn the attack on Iraq into a war against all those states perceived 
to offend US strategic interests. No task is more urgent than to expose the two 
astonishing lies contained in George Bush's radio address on Saturday, namely 
that "the United States does not desire military conflict, because we know the 
awful nature of war" and "we hope that Iraq complies with the world's demands". 
Mr Bush appears to have done everything in his power to prevent Iraq from complying 
with the world's demands, while ensuring that military conflict becomes inevitable. 
<P>On July 4 this year, Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, 
began negotiating with Iraq over the return of UN weapons inspectors. Iraq had 
resisted UN inspections for three and a half years, but now it felt the screw 
turning, and appeared to be on the point of capitulation. On July 5, the Pentagon 
leaked its war plan to the New York Times. The US, a Pentagon official revealed, 
was preparing "a major air campaign and land invasion" to "topple President Saddam 
Hussein". The talks immediately collapsed. 
<P>Ten days ago, they were about to resume. Hans Blix, the head of the UN inspections 
body, was due to meet Iraqi officials in Vienna, to discuss the practicalities 
of re-entering the country. The US airforce launched bombing raids on Basra, in 
southern Iraq, destroying a radar system. As the Russian government pointed out, 
the attack could scarcely have been better designed to scupper the talks. But 
this time the Iraqis, mindful of the consequences of excluding the inspectors, 
kept talking. Last Tuesday, they agreed to let the UN back in. The State Department 
immediately announced, with more candor than elegance, that it would "go into 
thwart mode". 
<P>It wasn't bluffing. The following day, it leaked the draft resolution on inspections 
it was placing before the UN Security Council. This resembles nothing so much 
as a plan for unopposed invasion. The decisions about which sites should be "inspected" 
would no longer be made by the UN alone, but also by "any permanent member of 
the security council", such as the United States. The people inspecting these 
sites could also be chosen by the US, and they would enjoy "unrestricted rights 
of entry into and out of Iraq" and "the right to free, unrestricted and immediate 
movement" within Iraq, "including unrestricted access to presidential sites". 
They would be permitted to establish "regional bases and operating bases throughout 
Iraq", where they would be "accompanied... by sufficient US security forces to 
protect them". They would have the right to declare exclusion zones, no-fly zones 
and "ground and air transit corridors". They would be allowed to fly and land 
as many planes, helicopters and surveillance drones in Iraq as they want, to set 
up "encrypted communication" networks and to seize "any equipment" they choose 
to lay hands on. 
<P>The resolution, in other words, could not have failed to remind Iraq of the 
alleged infiltration of the UN team in 1996. Both the Iraqi government and the 
former inspector Scott Ritter maintain that the weapons inspectors were joined 
that year by CIA covert operations specialists, who used the UN's special access 
to collect information and encourage the republican guard to launch a coup. On 
Thursday, Britain and the United States instructed the weapons inspectors not 
to enter Iraq until the new resolution has been adopted. 
<P>As Milan Rai's new book War Plan Iraq documents, the US has been undermining 
disarmament for years. The UN's principal means of persuasion was paragraph 22 
of the security council's resolution 687, which promised that economic sanctions 
would be lifted once Iraq ceased to possess weapons of mass destruction. But in 
April 1994, Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, unilaterally withdrew 
this promise, removing Iraq's main incentive to comply. Three years later his 
successor, Madeleine Albright, insisted that sanctions would not be lifted while 
Saddam remained in power. 
<P>The US government maintains that Saddam Hussein expelled the UN inspectors 
from Iraq in 1998, but this is not true. On October 30 1998, the US rejected a 
new UN proposal by again refusing to lift the oil embargo if Iraq disarmed. On 
the following day, the Iraqi government announced that it would cease to cooperate 
with the inspectors. In fact it permitted them to continue working, and over the 
next six weeks they completed around 300 operations. 
<P> On December 14, Richard Butler, the head of the inspection team, published 
a curiously contradictory report. The body of the report recorded that over the 
past month "the majority of the inspections of facilities and sites under the 
ongoing monitoring system were carried out with Iraq's cooperation", but his well-publicized 
conclusion was that "no progress" had been made. Russia and China accused Butler 
of bias. On December 15, the US ambassador to the UN warned him that his team 
should leave Iraq for its own safety. Butler pulled out, and on the following 
day the US started bombing Iraq. 
<P>From that point on, Saddam Hussein refused to allow UN inspectors to return. 
At the end of last year, Jose Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition 
of Chemical Weapons, proposed a means of resolving the crisis. His Organization 
had not been involved in the messy business of 1998, so he offered to send in 
his own inspectors, and complete the job the UN had almost finished. The US responded 
by demanding Bustani's dismissal. The other member states agreed to depose him 
only after the United States threatened to destroy the Organization if he stayed. 
Now Hans Blix, the head of the new UN inspectorate, may also be feeling the heat. 
On Tuesday he insisted that he would take his orders only from the security council. 
On Thursday, after an hour-long meeting with US officials, he agreed with the 
Americans that there should be no inspections until a new resolution had been 
approved. 
<P>For the past eight years the US, with Britain's help, appears to have been 
seeking to prevent a resolution of the crisis in Iraq. It is almost as if Iraq 
has been kept on ice, as a necessary enemy to be warmed up whenever the occasion 
demands. Today, as the economy slides and Bin Laden's latest mocking message suggests 
that the war on terrorism has so far failed, an enemy which can be located and 
bombed is more necessary than ever. A just war can be pursued only when all peaceful 
means have been exhausted. In this case, the peaceful means have been averted.
