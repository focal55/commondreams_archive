<p> Time was when Bali would have been the story of the year, the most violent 
act in 12 months, to be recalled with horror in December as the most terrible 
of crimes. But Bali was just the story of the month. And soon, perhaps, the Karachi 
bombings and the Bali bombings and the Mombasa bombings will be just stories of 
the week. See how easily we have acclimatized to death on a vast scale? What is 
to be this week's nightmare? How many innocents will be killed by the time you 
open next week's Independent on Sunday?</p>
<p>But last week's killings in Kenya and the attempt to bring down an Israeli 
airliner were far more important than most people realize. For by bringing Israel 
into the loop &#150; by allowing Israel to become a partner in President Bush's 
asinine "war on terror" &#150; al-Qa'ida has ensured that the Arab Muslim world 
will henceforth give its real if quiescent sympathy to Osama bin Laden. Outraged 
as many Arabs were at the international crimes against humanity of 11 September 
2001, few will object to an attack against Israelis, however cruel, while Israel's 
suppression of the Palestinians continues. If al-Qa'ida is now against Israel, 
Arabs will give their support.</p>
<p>With utter predictability, Ariel Sharon walked into the al-Qa'ida trap. He 
vowed "revenge". Thus any strike against the al-Qa'ida &#150; by America, by Britain, 
by Australia &#150; will be seen as an Israeli attack. America and Britain and 
Israel are now fighting on the same side. In the short term &#150; and in his 
mendacious attempt to link Yasser Arafat with Mr bin Laden &#150; Mr Sharon may 
have gained some advantage. At last, Israel's war on Palestinian "terror" can 
be placed on the same footing as its new war against al-Qa'ida. No longer will 
Mr Sharon's ghastly spokesmen have to justify their army's brutality towards Palestinians. 
Israel is fighting the same struggle of "good against evil" that President Bush 
invented for us just over a year ago.</p>
<p>But for Israelis, there is one big error in all this. By responding to al-Qa'ida's 
wicked assault on its civilians, it is taking on a mighty big opponent. For Mr 
bin Laden's men are not the hopeless suiciders that the Palestinians produce from 
their foetid refugee camps. The Afghanistan-trained men of Mr bin Laden's legion 
do not spring from the squalor of Gaza or the occupied masses of the West Bank. 
They are ruthless, highly motivated, intelligent &#150; just for once, William 
Safire was right when he called them "vicious warriors" &#150; and they may be 
more than a match for Israel's third-rate intelligence men. Israel's rabble of 
an army can kill child stone-throwers with ease. Al-Qa'ida is a quite different 
opponent. And if Mr Sharon wants to take on Mr bin Laden, he is ensuring that 
Israel goes to war with its most dangerous enemy in 54 years. Better by far to 
let the Americans tackle al-Qa'ida &#150; and even they don't seem to be all that 
successful &#150; than bring Israel into the battle.</p>
<p>Now, however, Messrs Bush and Blair will have to watch in silence as Mr Sharon 
bludgeons the occupied Palestinians into further submission. Israel is now engaged 
in our war, on our side, and whatever Israel does will now have the imprimatur 
of the "war on terror". Israel is now on the side of the good guys and if it kills 
nine children when its air force wants to assassinate a Hamas leader, the White 
House will not even be able to call it "heavy-handed". (Incidentally, it's instructive 
to note that while the child-killing in Gaza was "heavy-handed" in the words of 
Mr Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, the killing of 12 Israeli soldiers and policemen 
was described by the same gentleman as a "heinous crime".)</p>
<p>But let's move to one side for a moment. Has anyone spotted something amiss 
about the latest episode in the "war on terror"? Has it dawned on any of the chickenhawks 
in the US administration or in Downing Street that they are losing the initiative? 
Has anyone noticed that Mr bin Laden is writing the script? Al-Qa'ida attacks 
New York so we attack Afghanistan. Al-Qa'ida attacks in Bali and the Australian 
government re-pledges its support for America. Al-Qa'ida threatens America and 
so we murder four of its members in Yemen. And our governments &#150; even the 
Irish last week &#150; respond not by protecting us, not by uniting in a new, 
inspiring system of international justice, but by producing laws that will diminish 
our freedoms, our rights and our liberty. Under attack by al-Qa'ida? Let's tap 
into the telephones and emails of our innocent citizens. Let's frisk every Muslim 
who goes through our airports. Let's spy on our own people. How Mr bin Laden &#150; 
hardly a man of humor, as I can personally attest &#150; must be smiling.</p>
<p>Now Americans have got to live with the Department of Homeland Security. The 
Teutonic roots of this name &#150; Homeland translated as Heimat in the Reich 
&#150; are perhaps best ignored for the present. But already, travelers in the 
US are finding themselves targeted at airports because of their skin-color or 
their religion or their jobs.</p>
<p>Here's just one small example. I've recently finished another series of lectures 
at American universities. Americans are great people; they are bright and they 
want to learn the truth about the Middle East, not least because they realize. 
that their newspapers and television stations lie to them about the region. I 
give my lectures free of charge. The Independent and Independent on Sunday have 
thousands of readers in the US and we journalists have a duty to talk to them. 
But on this last trip, I notched up my 21st consecutive "random" security check 
at an airport boarding gate. Every time I travel on an American aircraft, up pops 
this little coding on my boarding card and all my hand-baggage is taken to bits.</p>
<p>Now I don't mind this at all. The security staff are polite, underpaid and 
often very friendly &#150; I even persuaded one to turn up at my talk in Manhattan 
&#150; but the origin of my journey, Beirut, or the number of pariah visas in 
my passport or perhaps just my reporting, has got me on to the American security 
list. The boarding card "security" coding is in fact quite easy to decipher &#150; 
and if a numbskull like me can work it out, be sure that the bad guys can &#150; 
but the point is that, yet again, a perfectly law-abiding civilian is paying the 
price for Mr bin Laden.</p>
<p>So here's a few thoughts. Why must we let al-Qa'ida write the script? Why don't 
we set up the machinery of real international law? Why don't we talk about "justice" 
rather than revenge? Why don't we have international tribunals so that those who 
wish to kill us can have their time in court? I don't want al-Qa'ida's members 
blown to pieces in Yemen by Mr Bush's hit squads. I want to see them tried, fairly 
and by due process. Of course, the Americans will whinge and whine about this. 
They will rabbit on about how Americans may be taken to court for political ends, 
about how American troops might be liable for war crimes trials &#150; and given 
some of their behavior in Afghanistan, I can well see why they would worry about 
this. I can see, too, why Mr Sharon would worry that he, too, could end up in 
court on war crimes charges for his involvement in the massacre of Palestinians 
at Sabra and Chatila in 1982. I don't know if Mr Sharon is guilty. But I think 
he deserves a fair trial.</p>
<p>No, I'm not equating al-Qa'ida and Mr Sharon, nor am I associating the innocent 
with the guilty. But it's time we wrote the script to this terrible conflict. 
It's time we stopped crushing our own freedoms. It's time we talked about law 
and fairness and justice. Not just for criminals. But for the whole Middle East.
