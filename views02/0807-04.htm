<p>WITH ALL the corporate and accounting scandals, you may have noticed that Congress 
is also working on bankruptcy reform legislation. A bill nearly passed last week 
and will probably be approved when Congress returns in September.
<P>However, this is precisely the wrong kind of reform. It is a measure long sought 
by the banking industry to make it easier to squeeze money from ordinary individuals 
who declare bankruptcy after facing personal hard times or being overwhelmed by 
debt.</P>
<P>Often these are individuals facing catastrophic illnesses or personal financial 
reverses. Sometimes they are people who ran up too much consumer debt, but in 
these buying binges the credit card companies are willing coconspirators. They 
foist credit cards on college kids with no visible means of support save parents. 
They encourage people to run up debts with multiple cards.</P>
<P>Why? In a low-interest-rate environment, lenders love those 20 percent, Mafia-style 
interest rates that many consumers foolishly pay, and creditors gladly take the 
occasional default as a cost of doing business. But in an economic downturn, the 
credit card companies fear real losses. Hence they want to get tough after the 
fact. Under the bill written by the financial services industry, consumers who 
went bankrupt, rather than having a clean slate, would still be liable for a portion 
of credit card and other debt.</P>
<P>Economists use the term ''moral hazard'' in describing a deal so sweet that 
it encourages the beneficiary to break the law or to sacrifice ordinary prudence. 
For example, if a landlord is allowed to insure his rundown building for three 
times its worth, there is a risk that he may be tempted to set it on fire. The 
credit card people like to say that easy bankruptcies create a moral hazard for 
consumers running up excessive debts. But the real moral hazard is the one perpetrated 
when purveyors of credit throw caution to the winds. </P>
<P>Weirdly, the only thing delaying the passage of this Scrooge legislation is 
an entirely extraneous controversy about abortion. One version of the bill includes 
an amendment making it impossible for anti-abortion thugs who damaged clinics 
or intimidated or harmed individuals to wriggle out of damage awards by declaring 
personal bankruptcy. The anti-abortion lobby considers this an outrage and has 
been blocking the bill.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the corporate guys keep declaring bankruptcy at record rates and 
for record sums. Even the Archdiocese of Boston is threatening bankruptcy if too 
many Catholics sexually abused by priests collect settlements.</P>
<P>Does anyone notice a double standard here? The logic of a business bankruptcy 
is to allow an orderly process so that old debts can be settled at so many cents 
on the dollar and the viable parts of the business can be rescued. What is galling 
under the circumstances is that the law allows the same scoundrels who ran the 
business into the ground to stay in charge of it after fleecing workers, shareholders, 
and creditors.</P>
<P>It doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes the business is broken up and 
sold off to pay debts and to leave its viable parts to take on new life under 
new owners. But increasingly, declaring bankruptcy is seen as just another business 
strategy to ''clean up balance sheets'' (i.e., stiff creditors) while the business 
and its executives keep merrily running along.</P>
<P>The real abusers of the bankruptcy process are less individuals than outfits 
like Enron and Adelphia. The fact that Congress is on the verge of passing a bankruptcy 
bill that goes after consumers and ignores corporations speaks volumes about who 
is really running the country. The credit card companies and their banker-partners 
have poured millions in campaign contributions into a willing Congress, and the 
measure has the support of many Democrats as well as Republicans.</P>
<P>If Congress were serious about addressing bankruptcy reform, it would scrap 
the proposed special interest legislation for the credit card industry and pass 
a bill requiring that whenever a business goes bankrupt it must get new ownership. 
That might remove a lot of moral hazard and deter frivolous bankruptcies. It would 
remove bankruptcy from the list of tactics that leave incumbent management largely 
unscathed. </P>
<P>When an outfit goes bankrupt and harms a lot of innocent people who did business 
with it in good faith, the captain should go down with the ship. </P>
