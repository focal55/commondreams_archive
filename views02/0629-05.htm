<p><I>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, All losses are restor'd and 
sorrows end</I> <BR>
Shakespeare,<I> Sonnet 30</I> 
<p>It's easy to make fun of the insurance companies. And it's easy to forget all 
that they have done for us over the years. That's why the article in a recent 
Wall Street Journal was so distressing. It made it sound as though the insurance 
companies are the bad guys when, in fact, we all know they are our friends. 
<P>The article described how insurance companies have begun reacting to depression 
inspired by the fact that lots of people have been filing lots of claims. Although 
the article didn't say so, part of the depression may have been a natural consequence 
of events of Sept. 11 that caused lots of people to file claims. On top of that, 
Congress got the companies' hopes up by starting to enact legislation that would 
have helped the companies out and then abandoning the effort. But more of that 
later. 
<P>According to the article, as a result of their depression, many insurance companies 
have started canceling insurance policies belonging to people who file claims, 
even if the claims are not the fault of the claimants. The article described the 
plight of a family named Sherrill in Georgia who had been good customers of USAA 
for 20 years for their homeowners insurance and 31 years for their car insurance. 
Then the Sherrills had a string of bad luck that included a lightning strike, 
a burst pipe and a car break-in, for all of which they filed claims, not realizing 
it would upset USAA. 
<P>It not only upset USAA. It caused the company to send the Sherrills a notice 
of non-renewal telling them it would no longer insure them because of their bad 
luck. The company likes to insure people who have better luck than the Sherrills. 
They told the Sherrills that their kind of luck was not "compatible with our underwriting 
standards." That is to say, USAA's standards prefer people who don't file claims 
to those who do. The Sherrills were not the only unfortunate people described 
in the story. 
<P>Susan and Lester Guyon were another family that discovered that the new procedures 
applied to them. Nature was their tutor. Insured by Farmers Insurance Group for 
35 years, they had the misfortune to be attacked by two hail storms within three 
years. When the second storm hit and they filed a claim for a new roof, the company 
dismissed them as clients saying one claim in ten years was acceptable and more 
frequent claims were not. 
<P>According to an internal memorandum at State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance 
Co. which is the nation's largest home insurer, agents were told that people with 
two claims in three years were good candidates for non-renewal. It will not take 
as new customers, anyone who has had a claim within the preceding three years. 
<P>Although the story gives the impression that the companies are heartless, in 
fact what the companies are doing vis-a-vis their insureds demonstrates the kind 
of ingenuity that is the hallmark of big business. The companies clearly had to 
do something to keep their shareholders happy in response to the enormous losses 
many of them suffered as a result of 9/11, especially when those losses were coupled 
with a generally unfavorable economy. At first they thought Congress might help 
out and that would have been a wonderful solution. 
<P>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Congress in fact considered passing legislation 
to bail out insurance companies in the event of future disasters because, as U.S. 
Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) so eloquently put it: "The glue that holds our 
economy together is insurance." Hearing that was something of a surprise but when 
one realized how right Mr. Oxley was, it became obvious that it was the most natural 
thing in the world for Congress to come to the aid of the companies in order to 
keep the economy together. The last thing anyone wanted after 9/11 was for the 
economy to come further unglued. Accordingly, the House of Representatives passed 
a bill that would have provided as much as $100 billion in government loans to 
the insurance industry to cover losses from future large-scale terrorist attacks. 
<P>The bill would have created a federal loan program to cover 90 percent of any 
insurance industry losses in excess of $1 billion. The first $20 billion would 
have been repaid by the insurance companies through a special assessment and the 
secretary of the treasury would then have decided whether to impose a special 
assessment on policy holders or have the balance paid by taxpayers. That was not 
all the bill did for the companies. 
<P>It limited a defendant's liability for pain and suffering, required that all 
suits be heard in federal court and placed a limit on how much lawyers could charge, 
adding a prison sentence for lawyers who charged more than the approved amount. 
The bill had lots of other great ideas as well but a Senate that did not realize 
that insurance is the glue that holds the economy together, did not approve of 
the legislation and it went nowhere. Not rescued by Congress, the industry is 
demonstrating its self-reliance. 
<P>By canceling the insurance of those who file claims and refusing to insure 
those who have had past losses, the companies will significantly reduce the amount 
they pay out, thus guaranteeing their own continued solvency. Instead of feeling 
depressed they should feel proud that they solved their problem without the help 
of the federal government, thus proving again that the free market system without 
government involvement is best. </p>
