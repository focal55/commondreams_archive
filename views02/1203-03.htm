<p>The president clearly does not want to know the truth about Sept. 11. Otherwise 
he would not have appointed Henry Kissinger to head an inquiry into the origins 
of arguably the most successful terrorist attack in history. Long an unabashed 
advocate of concealing and distorting the truth in the name of national security, 
he is the last guy who has the right to ask someone in government, "What did you 
know and when did you know it?"
<p>Kissinger, after all, was the member of the Nixon White House most bent on 
destroying Daniel Ellsberg for giving a copy of the Pentagon Papers, the government's 
secret history of the Vietnam War, to the New York Times. His obsession with preventing 
all government leaks, except those of his creation, is well documented in the 
Nixon tapes. And this is the man who publicly lied about everything from the bombing 
of Cambodia to the cover-up of the Watergate break-in of Democratic Party headquarters 
to the overthrow and death of the democratically elected leader of Chile.
<p>But even if truth serum could be slipped into his morning espresso, Kissinger 
still would be an appalling choice to lead what should be the fearless, unbiased 
fact-finding investigation necessary to prevent future tragedies like the destruction 
of the World Trade Center towers.
<p> He has been much too personally embroiled in the gamesmanship, greed and opportunism 
underlying politics in the Mideast; neither is he willing to disclose his long 
list of lucrative government and business contracts that pose potential conflicts 
of interest.
<p>For example, Kissinger Associates, the former secretary of State's ultra-connected 
consulting firm, has had dealings in the past with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- 
the two nations most closely linked with the 9/11 hijackers -- and was the subject 
of a congressional investigation for its role in the $4-billion bankrolling of 
Saddam Hussein in the late 1980s by the Atlanta office of Italy's BNL bank. Kissinger 
Associates then included Brent Scowcroft, who became national security advisor 
for President George H.W. Bush, and Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of State in 
that administration.
<p>That those ties crisscross with other suspicious activities of close Bush family 
advisors -- including Poppy Bush's consulting role with the Carlyle Group that 
took him to Saudi Arabia to drum up business -- makes Kissinger's selection as 
understandable as it is dishonest.
<p>The truth is, the administration doesn't want a commission looking into what 
went wrong on Sept. 11 because its focus might turn too close to home. The incoming 
Bush administration in 2001 ignored dire warnings from Clinton National Security 
Advisor Sandy Berger that Al Qaeda was the major security threat facing the U.S. 
Instead, the new administration focused on the war on drugs and even funneled 
"humanitarian" aid to Taliban-run Afghanistan as a reward for the fundamentalists' 
eradication of an opium crop.
<p>The truth about Sept. 11 might dampen Bush's exploitation of tragedy to draw 
attention from a sagging economy, a down stock market and stunning financial scandals 
that began with the downfall of Bush's close buddies at Enron. How convenient 
to divert the public's attention from other problems with the notion that the 
whole world must be turned upside down to combat terrorism, when marginal and 
avoidable mistakes by our government allowed the dreams of madmen to be fulfilled 
in blood.
<p>Would the monstrous new homeland security bureaucracy really have protected 
us from a few box-cutter-wielding nuts? How difficult, after all, is it to prevent 
people already on a terrorist wanted list from entering the country to attend 
U.S. flight schools? How hard is it for the president of the United States to 
get the FBI and the CIA to talk to each other? And why are we apparently going 
to war with Iraq, which had nothing to do with Sept. 11, instead of with Saudi 
Arabia, which did?
<p>The Bush administration was floundering before Sept. 11, and it still seems 
to have difficulty dealing with the nation's domestic problems. Instead of facing 
that harsh reality, Bush wants us to welcome the shredding of constitutional protections, 
allegedly for our own protection, and be excited at the prospect of a sideshow 
war with Hussein. 
<p>Best to not look too hard at any of this. The Bush administration resisted 
convening a 9/11 commission for more than a year and, when forced by overwhelming 
public pressure to do so, picked an infamous man with the legendary chops to quash 
any search for truth.
