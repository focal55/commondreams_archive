Now we get to see just how cowardly the Democrats in Congress can be. President 
Bush has proposed the most preposterous military buildup in human history--annual 
spending of $451 billion by 2007--and nary a word of criticism has been heard 
from the other side of the aisle. The president is drunk with the popularity that 
his war on terrorism has brought, and those sober Democrats and Republicans, who 
know better, are afraid to wrestle him for the keys to the budget before he drives 
off a cliff.
<p>The red ink that Bush wants us to bleed to line the pockets of the defense 
industry, along with the tax cuts for the rich, will do more damage to our country 
than any terrorist. The result will be an economically hobbled United States, 
unable to solve its major domestic problems or support meaningful foreign aid, 
its enormous wealth sacrificed at the altar of military hardware that is largely 
without purpose.
<p>Why the panic to throw billions more at the military when even the Pentagon 
brass have told us it is not needed? Our military forces, much maligned as inadequate 
by Bush during the election campaign, proved to be lacking in nothing once the 
administration decided to stop playing footsie with the Taliban and eliminate 
those monsters of our own creation. It was obviously not a lack of hardware that 
made us vulnerable to the cruelty of Sept. 11 but rather a failure of will by 
President Clinton, and then Bush, to brand the Taliban as terrorists and then 
to take out the well-marked camps of Al Qaeda with the counterinsurgency machine 
we have been perfecting since the Kennedy administration.
<p>Clinton authorized the elimination of Osama bin Laden in 1998, but the spy 
agencies simply failed to execute the order. Neither, apparently, were they competent 
enough to track Al Qaeda agents from training camps in Afghanistan to flight schools 
in Florida. All this even though these agencies possess secret budgets of at least 
$70 billion a year, combined.
<p>Despite the ability to read license plates from outer space and scan the world's 
e-mail, our intelligence agencies lost the trail of terrorists who easily found 
cover with lap dancers in strip joints.
<p>The bottom line is that we need sharper agents, not more expensive equipment. 
There is not an item in the Bush budget that will make us more secure from the 
next terrorist attack.
<p>That being obvious, Bush is now resorting to the tried and true "evil empire" 
rhetorical strategy, grouping the disparate regimes of Iraq, Iran and North Korea 
as an "axis of evil."
<p>This alleged axis then becomes the rationale for a grossly expanded military 
budget, the idea being that the United States must be prepared to fight a conventional 
war on three fronts.
<p>However, no such axis exists. North Korea is a tottering relic of a state whose 
nuclear operation was about to be bought off under the skilled leadership of the 
South Korean government when Bush jettisoned the deal. Iraq and Iran have been 
implacable foes for 25 years, and both were despised by the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
<p>Meanwhile, a key Muslim ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia, produced 15 
of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers--and Bin Laden. Saudi Arabia is also where Al Qaeda 
does its biggest fund-raising and yet, inexplicably, it is excluded from the new 
enemies list.
<p>Even if the accepted goal were the overthrow of the three brutal regimes targeted 
by President Bush, that would hardly requirean expansion of a war machine built 
to humble the Soviet Union in its prime.
<p>Is Bush the younger now telling us that his father failed to topple Saddam 
Hussein because he lacked sufficient firepower? The road to Baghdad was wide open 
after we obliterated the vaunted Iraqi tank army in a matter of weeks. Or does 
Bush the younger have even more grandiose plans in mind?
<p>His astonishing budget makes sense only if we are planning to use our mighty 
military in a pseudo-religious quest to create a super-dominant Pax Americana.
<p>Bizarre as that sounds, it may be the real framework for Bush's proposed spending 
orgy. In any case, almost every non-American speaker at the World Economic Forum 
in New York expressed fear at this specter.
<p>Even our own Bill Gates was alarmed at the United States' apparent hubris: 
"People who feel the world is tilted against them will spawn the kind of hatred 
that is very dangerous for all of us."
<p>Is it too much to ask that these billions, our billions, be spent to enhance 
our security rather than further erode it?
