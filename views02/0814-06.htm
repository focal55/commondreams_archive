<p> The garden was overgrown, the roses scrawny after a day of Kandahar heat, 
the dust in our eyes, noses, mouth, fingernails. But the message was straightforward. 
"This is a secret war," the Special Forces man told me. "And this is a dirty war. 
You don't know what is happening." And of course, we are not supposed to know. 
In a "war against terror", journalists are supposed to keep silent and rely on 
the good guys to sort out the bad guys without worrying too much about human rights.</p>
<p>How many human rights did the mass killers of 11 September allow their victims? 
You are either with us or against us. Whose side are you on? But the man in the 
garden was worried. He was not an American. He was one of the "coalition allies", 
as the Americans like to call the patsies who have trotted after them into the 
Afghan midden. "The Americans don't know what to do here now," he went on. "Their 
morale in Afghanistan is going downhill &#150; though there's no problem with 
the generals running things in Tampa. They're still gung-ho. But here the soldiers 
know things haven't gone right, that things aren't working. Even their interrogations 
went wrong". Brutally so, it seems.</p>
<p>In the early weeks of this year, the Americans raided two Afghan villages, 
killed 10 policemen belonging to the US-supported government of Hamid Karzai and 
started mistreating the survivors. American reporters &#150; in a rare show of 
mouse-like courage amid the self-censorship of their usual reporting &#150; quoted 
the prisoners as saying they had been beaten by US troops. According to Western 
officials in Kandahar, the US troops "gave the prisoners a thrashing".</p>
<p>Things have since changed. The American forces in Afghanistan, it seems, now 
leave the beatings to their Afghan allies, especially members of the so-called 
Afghan Special Forces, a Washington-supported group of thugs who are based in 
the former Khad secret police torture center in Kabul. "It's the Afghan Special 
Forces who beat the Pashtun prisoners for information now &#150; not the Americans," 
the Western military man told me. "But the CIA are there during the beatings, 
so the Americans are culpable, they let it happen."</p>
<p>This is just how the Americans began in Vietnam. They went in squeaky clean 
with advisers, there were some incidents of "termination with extreme prejudice", 
after which it was the Vietnamese intelligence boys who did the torture. The same 
with the Russians. When their soldiers poured across the border in 1979, they 
quickly left it to their Afghan allies in the Parcham and Khad secret police to 
carry out the "serious" interrogations. And if this is what the Americans are 
now up to in Afghanistan, what is happening to their prisoners at Guantanamo? 
Or, for that matter, at Bagram, the airbase north of Kabul to which all prisoners 
in Kandahar are now sent for investigation if local interrogators believe their 
captives have more to say.</p>
<p>Of course, it's possible to take a step back from this dark and sinister corner 
of America's Afghan adventure. In the aftermath of the Taliban's defeat humanitarian 
workers have achieved some little miracles. Unicef reports 486 female teachers 
at work in the five south-western provinces of the country with 16,674 girls now 
at school. Only in Uruzgan, where the Taliban were strongest, has not a single 
female teacher been employed. UN officials can boast that in these same, poverty-belt 
provinces, polio has now been almost eradicated.</p>
<p>The UN was fighting polio before the Taliban collapsed, and the drugs whose 
production the Taliban banned are now back on the market. The poppy fields are 
growing in Helmand province again, and in Uruzgan local warlords are trying to 
avoid government control in order to cultivate their own new poppy production 
centers. In Kabul, where two government ministers have been murdered in seven 
months, President Karzai is now protected &#150; at his own request &#150; by 
American bodyguards. And you don't have to be a political analyst to know what 
kind of message this sends to Afghans.</p>
<p>Kabul is alive with the kind of rumors that can never be substantiated but 
that stick in the mind, just as the dust of Kandahar stays in the throat and on 
the lips of all who go there. "The British forces were right to leave," a British 
humanitarian worker announced over dinner in Kabul one night. "They realized that 
the Americans had no real interest in returning this country to law and order. 
They knew that the Americans were going to fail. So they got out as soon as they 
could. The Americans say they want peace and stability. So why don't they let 
ISAF (the international force in Kabul) move into the other big cities of Afghanistan? 
Why do they let their friendly warlords persecute the rest of the country?"</p>
<p>Far more disturbing are persistent reports from northern Afghanistan of the 
massacre of thousands of Pashtuns after the slaughter at General Dostum's Qal-i-Jangi 
fort last November These mass murders, according to a humanitarian worker I have 
known for two decades &#150; he played a brave role in preventing killings in 
Lebanon in 1982 &#150; went on into December with the full knowledge of the Americans. 
But the US did nothing about it, any more than they did about the 600 Pakistani 
prisoners at Shirbagan, some of whom are still dying of starvation and ill-treatment 
at the hands of their Northern Alliance captors.</p>
<p>"There are mass graves all across the north, and the Americans, who know about 
this, have said nothing," my old friend said. "The British intelligence people 
knew this, too. And the British have said nothing."</p>
<p>There are those in Kabul who suspect that the Americans are now in Afghanistan 
for secondary reasons: to operate in and out of Pakistan, rather than in Afghanistan 
itself. "They've had plenty of muck-ups in Afghanistan and they could not base 
thousands of their soldiers in Pakistan," a Western officer in Kabul said. "They're 
safer here, and now they can go in and out of Pakistan and keep the pressure on 
Musharraf from here &#150; and on the Iranians too."</p>
<p>Last week, The Independent revealed that FBI officers have been seizing Arabs 
from their homes in Pakistan and bringing them across the border to Afghanistan 
for interrogation at Bagram.</p>
<p>It was the Special Forces man in the south who saw things a little more globally. 
"Perhaps the Americans can start withdrawing if there's another war &#150; if 
they go to war in Iraq. But the US can't handle two wars at the same time. They 
would be overstretched." So to end America's "war against terror" in Afghanistan 
&#150; a war that has left the drug-dealers of the Northern Alliance in disproportionate 
control of the Afghan government, many al-Qa'ida men on the loose and absolutely 
no peace in the country &#150; we have to have another war in Iraq.</p>
<p>As if the Israeli-Palestine conflict is not enough. But when Donald Rumsfeld, 
the US Secretary of Defense, can identify only a "so-called" Israeli-occupied 
territory on the West Bank &#150; the occupation troops there presumably being 
mistaken by the Pentagon as Swiss or Burmese soldiers &#150; there's not much 
point in taking a reality check in Washington.</p>
<p>The truth is that Afghanistan is on the brink of another disaster. Pakistan 
is now slipping into the very anarchy of which its opposition warned. And the 
Palestinian-Israeli war is now out of control. So we really need a war in Iraq, 
don't we?</p> </p>
