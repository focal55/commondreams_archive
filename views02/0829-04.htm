<p> In Britain there is no debate about an Iraq war because nobody important is 
prepared to make the case in favor. This is the big change that's become clear 
as summer ends. The demand that Tony Blair should inform a national argument before 
committing to a war was originally made out of apprehension on the part of people 
who didn't want one. They thought he might sweep into Baghdad behind George Bush 
without a word of discussion. 
<P>But the demand has been overtaken by events. If debate is what counts, it was 
won before it began. Opposition has assembled on an imposing scale before a word 
is spoken on the other side. Fewer than 20% of voters say they would support British 
involvement. Ministers, previously anxious to satisfy the Americans, have started 
running for cover from their own people. 
<P>In America, until recently, the position was the opposite. There was no debate 
because nobody dared to make a case against. The Democrats were, and still are, 
silent. The pro-war case, crudely pushed by Bush and regularly explained by the 
leading civilians in the Pentagon, kept being made with little counter-attack 
even in the press. There were doubts, but the cogent articulation all came from 
the other side. This may have something to do with the poll finding that 69% of 
Americans are in favor. of a military assault on Saddam Hussein. 
<P>Things have now changed in Washington, but the US remains the best - the only 
- place to hear the argument for war. This is as it should be. The US is the only 
actor that will count, and the only place outside Kuwait and maybe a few Gulf 
states where there's any significant lust for getting rid of Saddam by this means. 
If that didn't exist, nobody would be contemplating war, in Britain or anywhere 
else. Inside the British government, the motor of discussion is in any case not 
to do with the pros and cons of an attack but entirely with the usual British 
obsession: how to play the Americans, within the illusion of our special relationship. 
A pathetic and increasingly ignoble priority, given what's at stake in the Middle 
East and the world, but none the less the one that Whitehall refuses ever to reconsider. 
<P>Listening to the argument in the US, one has to accept it is serious and sincere. 
It's not all about hidden agendas, though some of those who make it should probably 
be required to register as pro-Israeli lobbyists. 
<P>America, say the apologists, is hugely strong. There's no axiomatic need for 
the world to remain in thrall to Saddam. We have the means to expel and kill him, 
and thereby start to turn a resource-rich and educated people from the millstone 
to the lodestone of the region. For Iraq is not Afghanistan, living in the middle 
ages. Nor is it Iran, in thrall to militant Islam. With one fell swoop of courage 
and commitment, we can bring a better life to Iraqis and stability to their neighbors. 
Seize the day. 
<P>Seize it, moreover, for the sake of America's own security. Saddam has seriously 
menacing biological weaponry, even if one rules out the nuclear. He may use it. 
He may already be doing business with al-Qaida, and now's the chance to wipe this 
linkage out. America, the case goes, has a duty to do this, and now, with September 
11 still a hideous memory in many minds, is the moment when it can be done. To 
do it would be a glorious not an infamous assertion of the new world order: a 
virtuous match between the new global terrorism and the newly unencumbered power 
that has the means to vanquish it. 
<P>Inside this case, though seldom mentioned, is also oil. The price of crude 
has risen 50% since the war talk revved up, adding to economic gloom in the US, 
but the war party doesn't care. More on their minds is Iraq's oil-richness. This 
adds harsh self-interest to windy speculations about ending terrorism, bolstering 
the belief of those who press a passionate case not just for regime replacement 
but era change. This war case, as vice-president Dick Cheney showed, is ever stronger 
in the mind of the president. But now at last it is being countered by voices 
that matter. 
<P>Bush, who detests the challenge of an argument, doesn't like this. Nor does 
defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who still seems to be pretending that all Iraq 
discussion is redundant. But I believe what beckons is, at last, a debate of some 
grandeur about America's role in the world. 
<P>Brent Scowcroft started this, and James Baker has followed it up. These are 
momentous Republican voices. Scowcroft, the first George Bush's intimate security 
adviser, asked the war party a list of painful questions about what they thought 
they were doing: who their allies would be, what sort of mayhem they were prepared 
to wreak in the region, what exactly they thought should follow Saddam. Baker, 
who was not only Reagan's secretary of state but the heavy hitter sent to Florida 
to secure the disputed election for Bush Two, surprised his friends by insisting 
that the UN must have a far bigger role than the White House envisages. 
<P>These people aren't against regime change in Iraq. But they're in favor of 
geopolitical coherence. Henry Kissinger, though typically Delphic in his advocacy, 
has staked out the same ground against the impetuous ideologues who simply want 
to seize the day. 
<P>This doesn't necessarily make war less likely. But it changes the terms. Coming 
from within the party, and amplified by other Republicans on the Hill, it poses 
a major challenge not to Bush's warrior ambitions but to his revulsion from what's 
called nation-building. What Scowcroft and other elders are pointing out is that 
things are nothing like as simple as the anti-Saddam missionaries seem to think. 
To claim, as Cheney did on Monday, that acting is less risky than not acting is 
nowhere near good enough. The demand now irretrievably on the table is for Bush 
to recognize that he cannot demolish Saddam without committing to rebuild Iraq, 
with all the attendant risks. If he wants to embark on this adventure, there's 
no way it can be done as a short-haul project. 
<P>The US, in other words, can't bomb and run, still less invade and run. That's 
what they hoped for in Afghanistan, where they're already pushing to get out, 
even as warlordism resumes. After an invasion of Iraq, it would be suicidally 
unrealistic. The only future, in terms of the Middle East peace Bush claims as 
the object of all this, requires a US security presence and huge political commitment 
for years to come. 
<P>Yet that runs counter to everything these hard-right Republicans came into 
office preaching. It envisages a return to the paternalistic American reach of 
the post-war era. It would be shockingly offensive to a bunch of gut isolationists, 
many of whom do not carry passports. But the discussion has begun to make things 
clear. Reality presses inexorably in. Either Bush and Cheney and the rest of the 
gang will become nation-builders, which they've been telling Americans is a terrible 
idea. Or they will have to abandon their plan for going to war with Saddam Hussein.</p>
