<i>"As a card-carrying scandalmonger, I am moved to ask: Where's the 
scandal?"  </i>--William Safire, 14 Jan. 2002.\1

<p><i>"Indignation is a precondition for whatever new laws and regulations 
are required to prevent behavior such as Enron's.  It has been said 
that the absence of honest emotion is the shared characteristic of 
American politics and professional wrestling.  One would like to hear 
from President Bush, regarding Enron's executives...." </i>-George F. 
Will, 16 Jan. 2002.\2


<p>So, now we know from two impeachable sources: "<i>Houston, we have a 
problem."</i>\3  And the problem's name is "Enron" - a nonsense word made 
up to keep the world from knowing what it did and who ran it.  But, 
"Enron" will soon take a meaning; it will become a noun representing 
the evils of the late 20th century American political economy.

<p align="center">***

<p>William Safire, Spiro Agnew's speech writer and the New York Times 
apologist for the two Bushes, Reagan and Nixon knows a scandal when he 
sees one.  He kept "Whitewater" alive for eight years.  His praise of 
the Bush II <http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/14/opinion/14SAFI.html>
administration's failure in October and November to do anything in 
response to Enron's "heads ups" sounds faint indeed.

<p>It will be interesting to learn whether the only Bush administration 
response was sympathetic clucks over the phone.  Or, did officials 
respond as the head of Arthur Andersen's Enron audit team: "Man the 
shredders!"

<p>And, was the timing just co-incidental of the November 2001 Executive 
Order restricting access to Bush I and Reagan presidential records and 
the deposit of Bush II's gubernatorial papers in a federal facility 
not subject to the Texas freedom of information act.

<p>Say what you like about the Republicans, they know how to handle a 
scandal.  And that old Nixon hand, William Safire, learned his 
"Watergate" lessons well.

<p align="center">***

<p>George F. Will is the most craven of the conservative punditocracy. 
When it's time to head for the hills, he finds the highest one and 
from it decries the very behavior he's encouraged for years.  His 
column today 
<http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/016/oped/From_evasion_to_outrage_about_
Enron+.shtml> concludes:

<p>"Now, Washington takes center stage.  By casting a cool eye on 
Enron's debris and those who made it, government can strengthen an 
economic system that depends on it."\4

<p>I don't believe in shooting fish in a barrel.  One should put them on 
the ground and give them a running chance.  So, I won't recall Will's 
devotion to deregulation, to the corporatization of government, to the 
defanging or abolition of regulatory agencies.  No, as I admire this 
walking catfish hightailing it toward the Blue Ridge, I will merely 
quote
him:

<p>"[The Enron collapse] will remind everyone ... that a mature 
capitalist economy is a government project.  A properly functioning 
free-market system does not spring spontaneously from society's soil 
as dandelions spring from suburban lawns.  Rather, it is a complex 
creation of laws and mores that guarantee among much else, 
transparency, meaning a sufficient stream ... of reliable information 
about the condition and conduct of corporations."\5

<p>After reading this paragraph, my first thought, having triple-checked 
the byline, was that George Will had done a Stephen Ambrose on Paul 
Krugman. Then I reread the article's first sentence and knew it could 
only be words of the master:

<p>"Narcissistic and even solipsistic, as usual, Washington thinks 
Enron's collapse is primarily a Washington, meaning a political, 
story."\6

<p>Quick: think what "narcissistic" means and relate it to your guess on 
"solipsistic"\7 while trying to keep straight how "Washington" might 
be wrong in seeing Enron in political terms.  Confused?  You've just 
been Willed.
 
<p>By column's end, quoted earlier, Will has pointed to "corporate 
corruption", vacillation by Bush II, the accountants' failure and the 
"coziness between corporations and their directors".  All to get to 
the point that "government" has to "strengthen" the "economic 
system".\8

<p>In short, the "Washington" of the first paragraph has the Enron 
situation dead right.  What we have is a political problem of the 
first magnitude.

<p align="center">***

<p>In law, accounting and investigative reporting, there is only one 
great rule: "Follow the money."  But in this case, following the money 
will keep us from addressing the great questions Enron forced upon us.

<p>According to Edward Ericson, Jr. 
<http://www.newmassmedia.com/nac.phtml?code=har&db=nac_fea&ref=18688>,
Enron has "2,832 subsidiaries, of which 874 are registered in the 
Cayman Islands or other tax and bank secrecy havens."\9 So, for years 
to come, we will be treated to stories about how money flowed fro and 
to - and to whom.

<p>And, diverting stories, just like Will's, they will be because they 
will focus on the scandal.  They will obscure the fact that "Enron" is 
to the 1980s and 90s as "Teapot Dome" was to the 1920s and "Standard 
Oil was to the 1890s.  "Enron" cuts across a broad range of political 
issues. Like it or not, we - the people, the polity - will have to 
address in
"Enron":
<p>
<ul>
<li>The role of money in elections.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The relationship between corporations and society - are 
corporations "accountable" to society or merely "responsible"?<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The desirability of regulating "natural" monopolies, such as 
electric utilities.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The social, military, environmental, societal and global costs of 
relying on oil and natural gas as our principal energy sources.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The consequences to the nation's interests of corporations acting 
as independent agents in foreign countries - as Enron did disastrously 
in India.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The social consequences of shifting the management of retirement 
assets to the individual via 401k plans and the like.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The continued benefits of absolving shareholders of responsibility 
for corporate mis- and mal-feasance while spreading their costs, 
through bankruptcy, across society.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The viability in the modern world of the corporate form - something 
Adam Smith doubted in 1776.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The social benefits of co-operative programs between industries and 
environmental regulators.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The ability of the states to regulate corporate behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list hardly exhausts the political questions "Enron" poses.  They 
could not have arisen at a worse time.

<p>The US and the West remain deeply shaken by the 9/11 attacks.  The US 
is led by an administration whose legitimacy is questioned by friend 
and foe alike and which has shown no capacity or desire to build and 
lead coalitions toward higher ends.

<p>But, there is never a good time for a perfect storm.  Perhaps the 
heightened sense of vulnerability we Americans feel will lead us to 
address "Enron" and the festering sores caused by the corporations 
unfettered of the 1980s and 90s.

<p>I suspect it will.
