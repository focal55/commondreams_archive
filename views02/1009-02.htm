<p>THE ECONOMY today is softening again. Consumers have taken a beating from stock market losses, layoffs, and slower job creation. Despite the economic slump, housing prices have stayed high, causing even more economic stress for renters and first-time home-buyers.
<P>

   Producers aren't doing so well either. The corporate meltdown has left several key sectors reeling - not just dot-coms, but biotech, telecommunications, and other high-tech industries. The airlines are in deep trouble. The Census Bureau recently reported that the poverty rate rose last year and median household income fell for the first time since 1991. Two members of the Federal Reserve's open market committee think the economic situation is serious enough that they publicly broke with Chairman Alan Greenspan to urge a cut in short-term interest rates.
<P>

   But now toss in the effects of a likely war with Iraq. What then?
<P>

   Most economists think two factors are keeping the economy out of recession - for now: very low interest rates and the administration's unintended deficit-spending. The huge tax cut of 2001 was advertised mainly as a Reagan-style break to reward investment and to allow taxpayers, especially upper-bracket ones, to keep more of their pre-tax income. Deficits were not supposed to result.  But, along with the war buildup, the tax cut has turned into old-fashioned Keynesian deficit-spending. The federal budget (not counting Social Security) has shifted from a surplus of $86 billion in 2000 to a projected deficit of $314 billion this year. With a war, the deficit will only grow.  A war with Iraq is expected to cost   billion dollars a day, so we could spend $200 billion on war in 2003. That's smaller than the cost of Vietnam relative to Gross Domestic Product, but still enough to have an economic impact.
<P>

   Ironically enough, that unintended deficit may save the country from a steeper slump. But it could also push up interest rates.
<P>

   Another complication is the role of oil. Iraq has the world's second largest proven oil reserves, after Saudi Arabia. There has been talk in conservative political circles of ''reprivatizing'' Iraq's oil fields (turning them over to western oil companies). This could offset the predicted wartime rise in the price of oil, and some of the revenues might even defray the cost of the war. 
<P>

   Leave aside for a moment the effect of this frankly neo-colonial power grab on our dwindling group of friends in the Middle East. Would an invasion of Iraq really reduce the price of oil? Last time we went to war in the Middle East, oil prices surged, perhaps prolonging the recession of 1991 that toppled George Bush Sr. Saddam could well choose to torch many of his oil fields rather than have them fall into the hands of hated western oil companies. 
<P>

   Finally, there is the matter of deflation. Lately some serious economists have been pointing to a danger unknown in the United States since the 1930s - the risk of falling prices. When an economy goes into a deflationary spiral, odd things happen. Monetary policy stops working well, because you can't cut interest rates below zero. Debts become more burdensome than usual because they are being paid off in more expensive money. 
<P>

   If the housing boom turns out to be a bubble, there could be a broad deflation in housing prices, leaving many homeowners with mortgage debts worth more than their collateral.  One reliable thing about wars, however, is that they are nearly always inflationary. (An exception was World War II, but only because of wage and price controls.) It's hard to imagine that deflation will break out in wartime. But inflationary pressures and rising deficits would almost surely cause the Fed to raise interest rates.
<P>

   President Bush's critics have accused him of a ''Wag-the-Dog'' scheme, in which war with Iraq diverts attention from both a failed war on terrorism and a weak economy. If everything breaks just right for Bush, the war won't merely take the spotlight off the economy - it will be a source of economic tonic.  However, wars seldom work out as planned. Vietnam stimulated the economy, but soon led to inflation, then stag-flation. This war could just as easily spook investors, spike the price of oil, and leave spiraling deficits that compelled the Fed to raise rates. Valued domestic public spending has already been sacrificed for tax-cutting and national defense, and that trend would only deepen.
<P>

   Wars are nothing if not uncertain. And when feelings of uncertainty rise, that is seldom good for the economy.
