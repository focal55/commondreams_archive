<p>Let me tell you, America, of the hopes I had for you. 
<P>As the smoke was swallowing Manhattan and the buildings fell and the terror 
spread into the farthest recesses of your land and your hearts, my hopes for you, 
America. 
<P>While around the world many of the past victims of your own terror, your own 
attacks, were thinking and often saying, saying and more often thinking, they 
deserve it, serves them right, it's about time they knew what it's like to be 
on the receiving end. Not true, I thought, I said. Nobody deserves terror. Justice. 
What we deserve, all of us, is some measure of justice. 
<P>My hopes for America: not that this was good for you. No, not that. But I have 
seen suffering before, I have seen widows wandering remote streets with the photos 
of their loved ones asking if anybody knows if they are alive or dead, I have 
watched men and women and even countries turn their deepest sorrows into a source 
of strength, a form of self-knowledge, a chance to grow. 
<P>A chance to grow, America, that was my hope. 
<P>Loss turned into maturity. 
<P>A chance to understand. Not alone, America, not alone in your grief. A perpetual 
valley of terror, that is what most of humanity is born into day after faraway 
day. Ignoring if tomorrow we will once again be assaulted and bombed, humiliated 
and tormented. America suddenly living what almost everyone else on this planet 
has experienced at some point yesterday or today: the precarious pit of everyday 
fear. 
<P>My hope for America: empathy, compassion, the capacity to imagine that you 
are not unique. Yes, America, if this dreadful destruction were only to teach 
you that your citizens and your dead are not the only ones who matter on this 
planet, if that experience were to lead you to wage a resolute war on the multiple 
terrors that haunt our already murderous new century. 
<P>An awakening, America. 
<P>Not to be. What did not happen. 
<P>Your country, hijacked. Your panic, used to take you on a journey of violence 
from which it is hard to return, the men at the controls not worried about crashing 
America into the world. 
<P>But not just the fault of the men who misgovern you. 
<P>They can only do what you have allowed them, responding, those men, to some 
of your deepest desires. 
<P>Above all, this: to be innocent again, to feel good about yourselves, after 
Vietnam. Vietnam? That country you turned into a mass graveyard? 
<P>Innocence, handed back to you, America, on 11 September 2001. A terrible price 
to pay, but there it is. Those atrocities, that devastation, finally making you 
all into victims. No ifs, no buts, no listening to the naysayers, no patience 
for those who suggest you look at your own history, your own interventions across 
the globe, to understand why so many out there in the crazed world might detest 
you. No more self-doubt, America. 
<P>Beware the plague of victimhood, America. 
<P>The finger I point at you, pointed back at my own self. I know that thrill, 
I have sweetly sucked it in, I have felt the surge of self-righteousness that 
comes from being unfairly hurt. Anything we do, justified. Any criticism against 
us, dismissed. 
<P>Beware the plague of fear and rage, America. 
<P>Nothing more dangerous: a giant who is afraid. Projecting power and terror 
so the demons within and without will not devour him, so the traumas of the past 
will not repeat themselves. 
<P>Beware the plague of amnesia, America. 
<P>Or have you forgotten Chile? Not just a name. Chile? Democratic Chile? Demonized, 
destabilized by your government in 1973? Chile? That country misruled for 17 years 
by a dictator you helped to install? 
<P>And other countries, other names. Iran, Nicaragua, the Congo, Indonesia, South 
Africa, Laos, Guatemala. Just names? Just footnotes in history books, your creatures? 
<P>But I do not speak to you only from afar. 
<P>How could I not wish you well? You gave me, an americano from the Latino South, 
this language of love that I return to you. You gave me the hot summer afternoons 
of my childhood in Queens when my starkest choice was whether to buy a Popsicle 
from the Good Humor Man or the fat driver of the Bungalow Bar truck. And then 
back to calculating Jackie Robinson's batting average. How could I not wish you 
well? You gave me refuge when I was barely a toddler, my family fleeing the fascist 
thugs in Argentina in the mid-Forties. One of you then. Still one of you now. 
How could I not wish you well? Years later, again it was to America I came with 
my own family, an exile from the Chile of Pinochet you helped to spawn into existence 
on precisely an 11 September, another Tuesday of doom. And yet, still wishing 
you well, America: you offered me the freedom to speak out that I did not have 
in Santiago, you gave me the opportunity to write and teach, you gave me a gringa 
grand-daughter, how could I not love the house she lives in? 
<P>Where is that America of mine? Where is that other America? Where is the America 
of 'as I would not be a slave so would I not be a master', the America of this 
'land is our land this land was meant for you and me', the America of all men, 
and all women, everyone of us on this ravaged, glorious earth of ours, all of 
us, created equal? Created equal: one baby in Afghanistan or Iraq as sacred as 
one baby in Minneapolis. Where is my America? The America that taught me tolerance 
of every race and every religion, that filled me with pioneer energy, that is 
generous to a fault when catastrophes strike? 
<P>So was I wrong? 
<P>When I hoped you would rise to the challenge as death visited you from the 
sky? When I believed America the just, the rebellious, the unselfish, was still 
alive? Not entirely spoiled by excessive wealth? With the courage to conquer its 
fear? 
<P>America learning the lesson of Vietnam. 
<P>Vietnam. More, many more than 3,000 dead. More, many more, than two cities 
bombed. More, more, more than one day of terror. 
<P>And yet, they do not hate you, America. 
<P>The enduring lesson of Vietnam. Not, next time obliterate the enemy. Not, next 
time satanize those who dissent. 
<P>What the Vietnamese are whispering to you: they remember and yet they do not 
hate. Not that easy, America, to forgive the pain. Or can you forget your own 
11 September that easily? 
<P>Not that easy, America. 
<P>To grow. 
<P>Or was I wrong? Have I become contaminated myself with your innocence, lived 
too long among you? Do you need 50,000 body bags coming home before you start 
to listen to your own voices of peace and dissent? 
<P>Am I wrong to believe that the country that gave the world jazz and Faulkner 
and Eleanor Roosevelt will be able to look at itself in the cracked mirror of 
history and join the rest of humanity, not as a city on a separate hill, but as 
one more city in the shining valleys of sorrow and uncertainty and hope where 
we all dwell?
