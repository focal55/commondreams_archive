<p>The American Constitution at the very beginning of the Republic sought above 
all to guard the country against reckless, ill-considered recourse to war. It 
required a declaration of war by the legislative branch, and gave Congress the 
power over appropriations even during wartime. Such caution existed before the 
great effort of the twentieth century to erect stronger barriers to war by way 
of international law and public morality, and to make this resistance to war the 
central feature of the United Nations charter. Consistent with this undertaking, 
German and Japanese leaders who engaged in aggressive war were punished after 
World War II as war criminals. The most prominent Americans at the time declared 
their support for such a framework of restraint as applicable in the future to 
all states, not just to the losers in a war. We all realize that the effort to 
avoid war has been far from successful, but it remains a goal widely shared by 
the peoples of the world and still endorsed by every government on the planet. 
</p>
<p> And yet, here we are, poised on the slippery precipice of a pre-emptive war, 
without even the benefit of meaningful public debate. The constitutional crisis 
is so deep that it is not even noticed. The unilateralism of the Bush White House 
is an affront to the rest of the world, which is unanimously opposed to such an 
action. The Democratic Party, even in its role as loyal opposition, should be 
doing its utmost to raise the difficult questions. Instead, the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, under the chairmanship of Democratic Senator Biden, organized 
two days of hearings, notable for the absence of critical voices. Such hearings 
are worse than nothing, creating a forum for advocates of war, fostering the illusion 
that no sensible dissent exists and thus serving mainly to raise the war fever 
a degree or two. How different might the impact of such hearings be if respected 
and informed critics of a pre-emptive war, such as Hans von Sponeck and Denis 
Halliday, both former UN coordinators of humanitarian assistance to Iraq who resigned 
in protest a few years back, were given the opportunity to appear before the senators. 
The media, too, have failed miserably in presenting to the American people the 
downside of war with Iraq. And the citizenry has been content to follow the White 
House on the warpath without demanding to know why the lives of young Americans 
should be put at risk, much less why the United States should go to war against 
a distant foreign country that has never attacked us and whose people have endured 
the most punishing sanctions in all of history for more than a decade.</p>
<p>This is not just a procedural demand that we respect the Constitution as we 
decide upon recourse to war--the most serious decision any society can make, not 
only for itself but for its adversary. It is also, in this instance, a substantive 
matter of the greatest weight. The United States is without doubt the world leader 
at this point, and its behavior with respect to war and law is likely to cast 
a long shadow across the future. To go legitimately to war in the world that currently 
exists can be based on three types of considerations: international law (self-defense 
as set forth in Article 51 backed by a UN mandate, as in the Gulf War), international 
morality (humanitarian intervention to prevent genocide or ethnic cleansing) and 
necessity (the survival and fundamental interests of a state are genuinely threatened 
and not really covered by international law, as arguably was the case in the war 
in Afghanistan).</p>
<p>With respect to Iraq, there is no pretense that international law supports 
such a war and little claim that the brutality of the Iraqi regime creates a foundation 
for humanitarian intervention. The Administration's argument for war rests on 
the necessity argument, the alleged risk posed by Iraqi acquisition of weapons 
of mass destruction, and the prospect that such weapons would be made available 
to Al Qaeda for future use against the United States. Such a risk, to the scant 
extent that it exists, can be addressed much more successfully by relying on deterrence 
and containment (which worked against the far more menacing Soviet Union for decades) 
than by aggressive warmaking. All the evidence going back to the Iran/Iraq War 
and the Gulf War shows that Saddam Hussein responds to pressure and threat and 
is not inclined to risk self-destruction. Indeed, if America attacks and if Iraq 
truly possesses weapons of mass destruction, the feared risks are likely to materialize 
as Iraq and Saddam confront defeat and humiliation, and have little left to lose.</p>
<p>A real public debate is needed not only to revitalize representative democracy 
but to head off an unnecessary war likely to bring widespread death and destruction 
as well as heighten regional dangers of economic and political instability, encourage 
future anti-American terrorism and give rise to a US isolationism that this time 
is not of its own choosing! </p>
<p>We must ask why the open American system is so closed in this instance. How 
can we explain this unsavory rush to judgment, when so many lives are at stake? 
What is now wrong with our system, with the vigilance of our citizenry, that such 
a course of action can be embarked upon without even evoking criticism in high 
places, much less mass opposition in the streets?</p>
