<p>AUSTIN, Texas &#151; Well, President Bush made his big speech on corporate 
reform Tuesday, and the stock market dropped 178 points. 
<P>As predicted, Bush proposed stiffer penalties for bad apples, evildoers and 
perpetrators of "malfee-ance." Unfortunately, that won't fix the system. 
<P>Much as one would like to see many corporate executives doing time alongside 
hard-working stick-up artists, that leaves the systemic problems in place. Among 
the leading structural factors causing the cascading scandals are conflict of 
interest on the part of auditors who also get paid by their clients as consultants, 
conflict of interest on the part of stock analysts and their investment-banker 
bosses, abuse of stock options encouraged by not having to count their cost against 
earnings, and lack of oversight on accountants and insider loans &#151; of the 
very kind Bush himself got at Harken. Bush addressed none of it. 
<P>Stiffer penalties for what is already illegal are not helpful when the problem 
is what is <I>legal.</I> Bush's effort to treat this as though it were simply 
a law 'n' order problem is not going to be effective. 
<P>Even the law 'n' order proposals are pretty pathetic. Bush wants the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to be able to punish corporate leaders "by banning them 
from ever serving as officers or directors of a public company." So if you rip-off 
your shareholders, destroy your workers' pensions and bail out just before the 
crash, taking your golden parachute with you &#151; we'll never let you do it 
again! That and 20 lashes with a wet noodle, and now we're talking deterrence. 
<P>The idea of setting up financial crimes SWAT teams would have more appeal if 
it wasn't effectively saying, "Don't worry about a thing &#151; we're putting 
John Ashcroft in charge." Great, there won't be an uncovered breast to be found 
anywhere in corporate America. (Just because I can't resist it, the obvious line 
about Ashcroft's 13-month investigation that netted 12 hookers in New Orleans 
is, "How'd he miss the other 10,000?") 
<P>Increasing the SEC's budget by $100 million sounds like a nice round number, 
but even the toothless House Republican bill includes almost three times that 
size &#151; $296 million. Given that the beleaguered agency is understaffed, under-financed, 
outgunned and outmanned, we could consider spending more than the price of one 
of our bad helicopters on it. 
<P>SEC personnel notoriously make less than those at other government agencies. 
On top that, they've got Harvey Pitt for a chairman. Pitt is the man who came 
in promising to make the SEC "a kinder and gentler place for accountants." Although 
Bush said "self-regulation is not enough," he did not address the need to create 
a strong oversight board to audit the auditors. 
<P>The rest of Bush's speech was a stern sermon on corporate ethics. Considering 
the source, it does raise the always-timely question, "Is God punishing us?" How 
much cognitive dissonance can people put up with? If Bush wants to lecture us 
on physical fitness, that's fine, but please, not corporate ethics. At least Bill 
Clinton never preached to us about chastity. 
<P>I'm sure we could all use some moral rearmament, but in case you hadn't noticed, 
we have no shortage of public scolds in this country. The old Ethics Czar Bill 
Bennett has been at it for years, not to mention television preachers, radio psychologists, 
Newt Gingrich, curbstone Freuds, backwoods Jeremiahs, Judge Bork, newspaper ethicists, 
etiquette consultants and the late Ann Landers. The country does not need another 
preacher: We need someone who can run the country. And that means someone bright 
enough to notice systemic problems in the financial markets. 
<P>Since the president proposes nothing to fix the problems &#151; the speech 
was basically a cheap sop to our <I>scha</I><I>denfreude</I> &#151; we can look 
for the situation to continue to get worse. We are already seeing a major pullout 
from U.S. markets by foreign investors. 
<P>You may not recall this because the media were totally preoccupied with Monica 
Lewinsky at the time, but a few years ago about a third of the world's financial 
markets collapsed. A few citizens who were paying attention managed some thoughtful 
analysis of the problems, including the critical role of capital flight by foreign 
investors. The U.S. got itself quite an obnoxious reputation at the time for giving 
condescending and unsound advice, most of it via the World Bank, to the afflicted 
countries. Time to dig out those old lectures and study them carefully for their 
errors. It's our turn in the tank. </p>
