<p>NEW YORK -- There's been a lot of talk recently about connecting dots--at least 
when the enemy is terrorism. Connecting the dots: That's what the FBI, CIA, NSA 
and the rest of the so-called intelligence agencies failed to do before Sept. 
11. Important facts got to somebody's files, but the crucial work of interpreting 
them, of connecting them to other important facts, never happened, and so the 
full picture remained hidden. Thanks to whistle-blowers and belatedly mobilized 
members of Congress, the difference between dots and pictures is now well understood.
<p>But let's look at our other current troubles. There are plenty of other dots 
going unconnected, seemingly isolated facts about current and future hazards of 
every variety--corporate corruption, economic fragility, ecological damage, alliance 
ruptures, foreign policy calamities. But these many vexations are not, in fact, 
disconnected. At the heart there is a pattern. The big, unacknowledged picture 
is this: The people in power represent an economic clique whose interests are 
only superficially tied to the well-being of the country as a whole. In collusion 
with their delighted big-money supporters, President Bush, Vice President Dick 
Cheney and their Cabinet-level entourage spent years lining their pockets with 
sweetheart loans, option deals and golden parachutes from oil companies and other 
related industries. They built political careers thundering against regulation, 
fueled by a cozy camaraderie with Enron and like companies that grew fat on--surprise!--deregulation. 
In office, these men make energy policy in cahoots with their ultra-wealthy sponsors, 
a club of very special Americans whose membership list they still keep secret. 
They consistently fight to secure America's energy dependency on oil and related 
fuels. Toward that end, defying the understanding of virtually everyone else in 
the world, they have denied the existence of global warming, willfully distorting 
the scientific evidence. When its own government scientists sounded alarms, the 
Bush posse dismissed them as ''the bureaucracy" and kept galloping down the oily 
path toward even more catastrophic global climate changes associated with petroleum 
dependency.
<p>These bullheaded good old boys prate about patriotism but see no problem with 
moving corporate headquarters offshore to avoid taxes. They prate about fiscal 
responsibility yet guarantee vast deficits by protecting billionaires from inheritance 
and other taxes. They declare war on terrorism yet arrange buddy-buddy deals with 
the same Saudi ruling caste that turned a calculated blind eye to Al Qaeda and 
America-hating madrasas. They talk ''under God" but they walk under oil. Is the 
pattern not obvious? These are the leaders who are going to lead America out of 
grave trouble?
<p>Democrats have a golden opportunity now to pound the podium and make a case 
to the nation that the interests in power--the interests who won a minority of 
the ballots cast but a majority of the Supreme Court during the 2000 presidential 
election--cannot be relied on to solve problems that their entire careers were 
devoted to creating. These interests are in revolt against plain American value 
and virtue. Even the honest men and women among them cannot muster the resolve 
to reform--their thinking is too deeply molded by the lives they've led.
<p>Lifelong defenders of subsidized laissez faire for the wealthy who can afford 
the price of the ticket (remember the savings and loan rip-offs?), averse to the 
enforcement of public justice for everyone else (remember Ronald Reagan's ''government 
is not the solution; government is the problem"?), they are true believers in 
the superior rights of people like themselves. Now, late in the game, they dress 
up and pretend to be sheriffs, but they are more in the mold of trickle-downer 
Herbert Hoover than of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who understood that capitalism had 
to be saved from capitalists.
<p>We might properly ask, where were the Democrats when the clique was mobilizing 
to win back the White House in order to push for yet more deregulation? The man 
who, more than anyone else, drew the necessary diagram to connect the dots was 
not Al Gore but the underappreciated political theorist (and Hollywood filmmaker) 
Rob Reiner. After the Republican convention of 2000, where African Americans trotted 
out on stage far outnumbered African American delegates, and self-congratulation 
about ''diversity" was the order of the day, it was left to Reiner to make the 
elegant point that the Republicans truly did believe in diversity: After all, 
they nominated executives from two different oil companies.
<p>Was it not obvious once you heard it?
<p>But Democrats were timid about pressing the point. It wouldn't sound nice. 
It would sound like, well, too anti-business, too liberal, too 1960s or otherwise 
retro. The hard-charging Dow, they thought, would undercut their point.
<p>Anyway, the Democrats were too compromised. They had made too many of their 
own deals with the oil-deregulation-and-book-cooking complex. After President 
Clinton and Gore tried to tamper with their entitlements and prerogatives early 
in their first administration, only to get slapped down, the top Democrats convinced 
themselves that corporate growth (never mind who kept the books) was the emolument 
not only for America but for global inequality across the board. Feeling middle-class 
complacency, under pressure from hate-mongering Republicans and an unrelenting 
press, Clinton and his party decided they could not do better than believe in 
Wall Street.
<p>The approach worked--for as long as it worked. But they spent far more time 
catering to the tycoons than doing right by the teachers and cops and firefighters, 
who, we now understand, are the real heroes.
<p>Now, the Democrats need to do more than win the votes for this or that new 
corporate regulation. They need to move beyond merely feeling smug about how the 
Republicans have sabotaged themselves. They need to confess their own sins--as 
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has done. But even more, they need to back the Republicans 
into their chosen corner. They need to connect with the healthy side of American 
skepticism. They need to be thunderous and clear on the essentials.
<p>If the Democrats forfeit the opportunity now handed them to connect all the 
flaming dots, they are truly as flabby, corrupt and venal as Ralph Nader says.
