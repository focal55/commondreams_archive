<p>THE SUMMER has been filled with images of disgraced executives being hustled 
off to court by federal agents and stories about the improper reporting of billions 
of dollars on company financial statements.
<P>From Adelphia to WorldCom, the corporate follies of 2001 have altered the portrayal 
of corporate leaders in the traditionally uncritical business press. Questions 
of greed, integrity, and fundamental honesty have diminshed the fawning adulation 
of executives as society's saviors.</P>
<P>The enormous compensation packages of Ken Lay, Bernard Ebbers, and others have 
led to studies demonstrating that these men's standards of living are not out 
of the ordinary. In 2000, American CEOs earned 531 times more than the average 
worker compared with 42 times more in 1980. In fact, since the mid-1970s, the 
richest 1 percent of the population has captured 70 percent of all earnings growth.</P>
<P>The corporate accounting scandal has provided entertainment, prompted prosecutions, 
initiated reform legislation, and punctured the myth of the infallibility of business 
leaders, but a more fundamental insight is being ignored.</P>
<P>America's dirty little secret is not simply the excesses of the super-rich, 
but the underlying shift in economic inequality across our entire society over 
the last 30 years. Since 1973, average hourly earnings have actually dropped by 
0.4 percent despite boosts in productivity and periods of economic boom. The majority 
of the work force has seen incomes stagnate or decline, and the only reason families 
are slightly better off is that it now takes two wage-earners to stay ahead of 
the previous generation's single head of household's earnings.</P>
<P>Yet even those marginal benefits have not been shared evenly. From 1977 to 
1999, the share of all family income declined absolutely for the bottom 80 percent 
of the population. The top 20 percent's share increased by 14 percent, resulting 
in that group's income accounting for half of all earnings. The loss of decent 
jobs overseas, the shift from a manufacturing to a lower-waged service economy, 
and the political attacks on labor unions that were in part responsible for the 
post-World War II trend toward economic equality are all causes of an increasingly 
divided society.</P>
<P>While the final years of the 1990s slowed the overall dynamic, the reconfigured 
American social structure still looks like a heavily bottom-weighted hourglass 
with a hollowed-out middle.</P>
<P>Economists and journalists have been noticing these developments for a decade, 
but the debate has rarely reached national mainstream political circles. Democrats 
who discuss economic inequality risk losing contributions from corporate donors 
and being branded as proponents of class warfare. In the last presidential race, 
Al Gore promised to focus on those forgotten by the economic boom in his stump 
speeches, but those paragraphs were forgotten in the campaign's final weeks.</P>
<P>Ironically, it was Republican candidate Pat Buchanan's odd ''peasants with 
pitchforks'' campaign in 1996 that elevated the issue for a few months and forced 
Bill Clinton and Bob Dole to acknowledge the problem. Apparently Buchanan's charter 
membership in the Republican right inoculated him against charges of fomenting 
class war.</P>
<P>Too many candidates and consultants from both parties dismissively assume that 
these trends only impact the poor, politically marginal, and less likely to vote. 
But growing inequality is a serious problem for the vast majority of the population 
of the United States, working families, and middle-class voters - all but the 
top one-fifth of the nation's citizens. The stark reality is that in 1999, real 
after-tax income flowing to the middle 60 percent of households was less than 
it was in 1977.</P>
<P>As summer turns to fall, some executives may land in jail, government oversight 
will be tightened, and publicly traded company balance sheets will be more skeptically 
examined. The notion that the average citizen can get rich quick by investing 
in companies that make no products is mercifully going by the wayside.</P>
<P>American men and women will continue to work longer hours at more jobs just 
to tread water financially, like hamsters running circles in a cage. The real 
question is, when the attention inevitably shifts to the next big scandal, will 
anyone have taken stock of what has happened to four-fifths of the population 
over the last 30 years?</P>
