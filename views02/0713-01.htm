<p>PLUTOCRACY IS one of those words that seems to belong to a bygone era.
<P></P>
The notion of government by the rich, for the rich, conjures up images of European 
aristocrats, Russian czars or African potentates.
<P></P>
Look closer to home, says American commentator Kevin Phillips, author of a disturbing 
new book entitled <i>Wealth and Democracy</i>. He depicts the United States as 
"the most polarized and inequality-ridden of major Western nations" and warns 
the current concentration of power in the hands of a moneyed elite is unsustainable.
<P></P>
This is the sort of analysis one might expect from a left-leaning polemicist in 
a season of confidence-busting corporate scandals.
<P></P>
But Phillips is a Republican. Moreover, he started work on <i>Wealth and </i><i>Democracy</i> 
in 1999, when the American economy was red-hot, stock prices were soaring and 
analysts could see no end to the bull market.
<P></P>
Two things troubled him.
<P></P>
He saw eerie parallels between the market mania of the late 20th century and the 
speculative booms of the roaring '20s and the Gilded Age (1870-90). Then, as now, 
a privileged elite was enriching itself at the expense of everybody else.
<P></P>
"As wealth concentration grows, especially near the crest of a drawn-out boom, 
so does upper-bracket control of politics and its ability to shape its own preferment," 
Phillips noted. "The cost to ordinary Americans has been substantial — in reduced 
median family income, in stagnant wages, in a diminished sense of community and 
commonweal, in fewer private and government services and sometimes in poorer physical 
and mental health amid money-culture values, work hours and competitive consumption."
<P></P>
His second concern was that corporate leviathans were pouring obscene amounts 
of money into the electoral system. By the time George W. Bush won the presidency 
in late 2000, Phillips was convinced that big business had bought control of the 
political agenda.
<P></P>
"The essence of plutocracy, fulfilled in 2000, has been the determination and 
ability of wealth to reach beyond its own realm of money and control politics 
and government as well," he wrote.
<P></P>
If Phillips had merely been prescient, his book would be clever, but not compelling. 
What gives <i>Wealth and Democracy </i>its moral weight are the lessons he draws 
from past plutocracies and the way he applies them to the U.S. and other countries 
that allow the wealthy few to benefit at the expense of the many.
<P></P>
He looks at three once-great powers that went through cycles of giddy accumulation, 
global pre-eminence, increasing polarization, dissipation and decline.
<P></P>
The first was Spain, whose galleons plundered the world for gold and silver in 
the 16th century. Next came Holland, the greatest commercial power of the 17th 
century. Finally, he examines 19th-century Britain, with its thriving factories, 
railroads, docks and far-flung empire.
<P></P>
All three thought they could rewrite the rules of history and remain at the pinnacle 
forever.
<P></P>
But each followed the same trajectory: a 50-year climb to global ascendancy, a 
golden era in which all prospered, a widening of the gap between rich and poor, 
a shift from technological innovation to financial speculation, and a slide into 
decadence, corruption and decay.
<P></P>
Looking at his homeland, Phillips sees all the danger signals of a superpower 
in decline.
<P></P>
The richest one per cent of Americans have reaped more than half of the nation's 
income gains in the last decade. Paper wealth has outpaced productivity. The middle 
class is working longer and harder to keep up. Federal and state legislators have 
cut business taxes, loosened health and safety regulations, encouraged profligate 
energy use and shrugged off calls for campaign finance reform. And now, a wave 
of scandals is shaking corporate America.
<P></P>
Canada, too, is becoming sharply polarized. The richest 20 per cent of families 
now earn 45.2 per cent of the nation's income — a 9 per cent gain over the past 
decade. The poorest 20 per cent earn 3.1 per cent — a drop of 18.5 per cent.
<P></P>
Canadian politicians, like their American counterparts, are paying obeisance to 
the marketplace at the expense of equity, the environment and human health.
<P></P>
Phillips stops short of forecasting the inevitable downfall of North America. 
<P></P>
With the right political leadership and the right mix of policies — high taxes 
on capital gains and inherited wealth, progressive social programs and strict 
oversight of corporations — it might be possible to free democracy from the grip 
of commerce, he suggests.
<P></P>
Lectures like the one Bush delivered to Wall Street executives this week aren't 
enough. Neither are jail terms for prominent white-collar criminals.
<P></P>
As long as wealthy politicians depend on corporate largesse to get elected, America 
will be governed by the rich, for the rich.
<P></P>
The only way to dismantle a plutocracy is to sever the link between money and 
power.
