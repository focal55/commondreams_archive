IT&#39;S A sad day for American democracy when the leaders of countries whose 
human rights records and democratic practices are as deeply flawed as those of 
Paraguay and Peru show more respect for democratic institutions and the rule of 
law than the U.S. government demonstrates. But that&#39;s what happened last weekend, 
after elements of Venezuela&#39;s military led a coup that briefly ousted the 
country&#39;s elected president, Hugo Chavez. 
<P> Mr. Chavez&#39;s return to office is a triumph for his country&#39;s embattled 
democratic institutions and for the popularly elected leaders who stood behind 
his government. But the affair was a black eye for the Bush administration, which 
strained U.S. ties to allies in the region by backing the coup and will now have 
little credibility as an advocate for democracy in the Americas. 
<P> After strikes and unrest forced Mr. Chavez out of office April 11, a so-called 
interim government headed by businessman Pedro Carmona imprisoned the elected 
president, arrested other top government officials, dismissed the National Constituent 
Assembly and supreme court and suspended the constitution that the nation&#39;s 
voters had endorsed just two years ago. The unrest apparently was organized by 
factions of the country&#39;s military and financial elites determined to oust 
Mr. Chavez. 
<P> Countries throughout the hemisphere quickly condemned the coup, with the sharpest 
denunciations from nations such as Paraguay, Argentina and Peru, which have endured 
great brutality under military dictatorships. The Organization of American States 
denounced &quot;the alteration of the constitutional order in Venezuela&quot; 
and refused to recognize the regime. 
<P> But the tone was very different in Washington. 
<P> The Bush administration refused to call a coup a coup. White House spokesman 
Ari Fleischer referred instead to &quot;a combustible situation in which Chavez 
resigned.&quot; The administration expressed support for Mr. Carmona as it unsuccessfully 
lobbied the OAS to tone down its criticism of his regime. 
<P> Indeed, a report by The New York Times that leaders of the coup recently met 
with senior Bush administration officials, who backed the Venezuelans&#39; belief 
that Mr. Chavez should be removed, will fuel rampant suspicions in Latin America 
that the Colossus of the North was behind the overthrow. 
<P> With its class-conscious rhetoric of social revolution and friendly relationships 
with Cuba and OPEC colleagues such as Iran and Iraq, the Chavez government long 
has been a thorn in President Bush&#39;s side. 
<P> Mr. Chavez&#39;s sometimes strident rhetoric and egotistical style have sharpened 
some of his nation&#39;s divisions. And as Venezuela&#39;s economy weakened over 
the last year under the weight of falling oil prices and questionable economic 
policies, Mr. Chavez&#39;s once-overwhelming popularity has waned, and unrest 
increased, in a country that is the third-largest exporter of oil to the United 
States. 
<P> While all of this is cause for concern, the intensity of the Bush administration&#39;s 
hostility to Mr. Chavez is unwarranted. 
<P> Although he&#39;s chummy with Fidel Castro, Mr. Chavez is no socialist. He&#39;s 
an economic nationalist whose economic policies are much more reminiscent of Juan 
Peron&#39;s Argentina than Mr. Castro&#39;s Cuba. 
<P> And Mr. Chavez didn&#39;t introduce class divisions to Venezuela. In fact, 
he was elected to address them. Despite the country&#39;s tremendous oil resources, 
more than 80 percent of Venezuelans are considered poor and many eke out marginal 
lives in the sprawling slums that surround the nation&#39;s cities. 
<P> Large majorities twice elected Mr. Chavez president, giving him a strong mandate 
to help the nation&#39;s poor and break the stranglehold of the two corrupt political 
parties that have dominated Venezuelan politics for decades. Despite his mistakes, 
Mr. Chavez remains a powerful symbol of hope for many of his nation&#39;s poor. 
And the democratic institutions the coup threatened are deeply valued, even by 
many in Venezuela and throughout Latin America who oppose Mr. Chavez&#39;s policies. 
<P> Peru&#39;s President Alejandro Toledo, who is no friend of Mr. Chavez&#39;s, 
explained his country&#39;s opposition to the coup like this: &quot;We are not 
defending the democratic characteristics of a particular government, we are defending 
the principle of the rule of law.&quot; 
<P> Most Americans might have thought the leaders of a country proud of its more 
than 200-year tradition of constitutional rule and eager to see itself as a beacon 
for democracy would respect such basic democratic principles. 
<P> But in the case of the Bush administration&#39;s policy on Venezuela, as in 
so many other cases in the blood-dimmed history of U.S.-Latin American relations, 
they would be sadly mistaken.
