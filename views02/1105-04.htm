<p>To placate its powerful allies on the extreme right, the Bush administration 
is once again playing political games with the fate of our planet.
<p>The latest watershed global agreement the White House is sabotaging is a bold 
international accord the U.S. helped write that offers real hope for stabilizing 
the world's exploding population.
<p>In 200 years, the world's population has grown sixfold; it could almost double 
again by 2050. Every second, two people die and five are born. And while population 
growth has always been a controversial issue, it is now clear that we have begun 
to severely strain the Earth's finite resources.
<p> Chaos is the increasingly real result of trying to support more than 6 billion 
people on this planet, spawning desperate mass migrations, wars over rights to 
fresh water, medical epidemics, bloody riots and crime waves nurtured in teeming 
shantytowns.
<p>The war on terrorism, too, cannot logically be divorced from the struggle for 
population sanity. Refugee camps and hopeless slums steadily churn out alienated, 
landless young men and women who are perfect cannon fodder for ambitious religious 
and political zealots.
<p>At the 1994 United Nations population conference in Cairo, nations with different 
religious, social and political make-ups bravely acknowledged that the only proven 
way to slow the pace of the population explosion was to empower women by giving 
them reproductive rights, basic education and adequate health care so that they 
are capable of choosing a family size that offers them the best chance at being 
economically successful.
<p>This was a revolutionary idea because for much of human history a large brood 
of children, particularly boys, was valued as a source of farm labor; the value 
of women was based on their reproductive capacity.
<p>Modern sanitation and medical practices, however, have changed human death 
rates in the last two centuries, especially in terms of infant mortality, but 
rural cultures, fundamentalist religions and nationalist politicians have been 
slow to adapt to the reality that more is no longer always better.
<p>It was such reactionary forces, led by a trio of odd bedfellows -- the U.S. 
religious right, several repressive Muslim regimes and the Vatican -- that have 
worked to put the kibosh on the final declaration of the U.N. conference, a carefully 
crafted pact supported by 179 nations. Now they have found their knight in shining 
armor in President Bush, who apparently wanted to shore up his right flank for 
the midterm elections and whose administration is now threatening to withdraw 
crucial U.S. support for the agreement based on some of its language.
<p>One of the White House's beefs, for example, is with a line that says that 
in societies where abortion is legal, health care should be provided to make the 
procedure safe. According to the National Right to Life Committee, which heartily 
praised Bush's stance, statements like the one in the agreement are "code" advocating 
abortions.
<p>But given that abortions are legal in the United States and are required to 
be medically sound, why would an American president seek to deny that standard 
of health-care protection to the rest of the world?
<p>Here's why: Women in other countries can't vote in U.S. elections, but the 
members of the National Right to Life Committee not only vote but also donate 
to candidates and political action committees.
<p>More than any other in recent memory, this administration is marked by a foreign 
policy driven primarily by a domestic agenda.
<p>To seek the votes of the right-to-life caucus by mucking about with the excruciatingly 
complex and difficult task of reining in world population is as dangerous in its 
effect as it is tawdry in its motive.
<p>And, once again, our arrogant unilateralism will cost us strategically as well 
as morally. When overpopulated China, India and Indonesia, as well as nations 
in Europe dealing with myriad crises arising from immigration, all react bitterly 
to this latest American isolationism, can we be surprised that they are hesitant 
to support Bush's jihad against Iraq?
<p>Of course, this won't bother the aggressive claque of right-wing think-tankers 
currently running the foreign policy of the most powerful nation in the existence 
of humanity, who seem to think that power makes us God. 
<p>We are not God, and our power must not be abused. At a time when the gap between 
the rich and the poor is dangerously increasing, when vast armies of the desperately 
poor are crashing through national boundaries, it is irresponsible in the extreme 
to sacrifice world population stability on the altar of domestic political advantage.</p>
