<p>The current crisis in American capitalism isn't just about the specific details 
— about tricky accounting, stock options, loans to executives, and so on. It's 
about the way the game has been rigged on behalf of insiders. </p>
<P> And the Bush administration is full of such insiders. That's why President 
Bush cannot get away with merely rhetorical opposition to executive wrongdoers. 
To give the most extreme example (so far), how can we take his moralizing seriously 
when Thomas White — whose division of <org idsrc="NYSE" value="ENRNQ;ENE-J">Enron</org> 
generated $500 million in phony profits, and who sold $12 million in stock just 
before the company collapsed — is still secretary of the Army? </p>
<P> Yet everything Mr. Bush has said and done lately shows that he doesn't get 
it. Asked about the Aloha Petroleum deal at his former company <org idsrc="AMEX" value="HEC">Harken 
Energy</org> — in which big profits were recorded on a sale that was paid for 
by the company itself, a transaction that obviously had no meaning except as a 
way to inflate reported earnings — he responded, "There was an honest difference 
of opinion. . . . sometimes things aren't exactly black-and-white when it comes 
to accounting procedures." </p>
<P> And he still opposes both reforms that would reduce the incentives for corporate 
scams, such as requiring companies to count executive stock options against profits, 
and reforms that would make it harder to carry out such scams, such as not allowing 
accountants to take consulting fees from the same firms they audit.</p>
<P> The closest thing to a substantive proposal in Mr. Bush's tough-talking, nearly 
content-free speech on Tuesday was his call for extra punishment for executives 
convicted of fraud. But that's an empty threat. In reality, top executives rarely 
get charged with crimes; not a single indictment has yet been brought in the Enron 
affair, and even "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap, a serial book-cooker, faces only a civil 
suit. And they almost never get convicted. Accounting issues are technical enough 
to confuse many juries; expensive lawyers make the most of that confusion; and 
if all else fails, big-name executives have friends in high places who protect 
them.</p>
<P> In this as in so much of the corporate governance issue, the current wave 
of scandal is prefigured by President Bush's own history.</p>
<P> An aside: Some pundits have tried to dismiss questions about Mr. Bush's business 
career as unfair — it was long ago, and hence irrelevant. Yet many of these same 
pundits thought it was perfectly appropriate to spend seven years and $70 million 
investigating a failed land deal that was even further in Bill Clinton's past. 
And if they want something more recent, how about reporting on the story of Mr. 
Bush's extraordinarily lucrative investment in the Texas Rangers, which became 
so profitable because of a highly incestuous web of public policy and private 
deals? As in the case of Harken, no hard work is necessary; Joe Conason laid it 
all out in Harper's almost two years ago. </p>
<P> But the Harken story still has more to teach us, because the S.E.C. investigation 
into Mr. Bush's stock sale is a perfect illustration of why his tough talk won't 
scare well-connected malefactors.</p>
<P> Mr. Bush claims that he was "vetted" by the S.E.C. In fact, the agency's investigation 
was peculiarly perfunctory. It somehow decided that Mr. Bush's perfectly timed 
stock sale did not reflect inside information without interviewing him, or any 
other members of Harken's board. Maybe top officials at the S.E.C. felt they already 
knew enough about Mr. Bush: his father, the president, had appointed a good friend 
as S.E.C. chairman. And the general counsel, who would normally make decisions 
about legal action, had previously been George W. Bush's personal lawyer — he 
negotiated the purchase of the Texas Rangers. I am not making this up.</p>
<P> Most corporate wrongdoers won't be quite as well connected as the young Mr. 
Bush; but like him, they will expect, and probably receive, kid-glove treatment. 
In an interesting parallel, today's S.E.C., which claims to be investigating the 
highly questionable accounting at <org idsrc="NYSE" value="HAL">Halliburton</org> 
that turned a loss into a reported profit, has yet to interview the C.E.O. at 
the time — Dick Cheney. </p>
<P> The bottom line is that in the last week any hopes you might have had that 
Mr. Bush would make a break from his past and champion desperately needed corporate 
reform have been dashed. Mr. Bush is not a real reformer; he just plays one on 
TV. </p>
