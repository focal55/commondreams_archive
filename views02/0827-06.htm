<p>Remember this phrase: “ Texas is clearly one of the most dominant states in 
setting textbook adoption standards”, according to Stephen Driesler, executive 
director of the American Association of Publisher’s school division. And this 
November the Texas school board inflamed by the anti-environmental science rhetoric 
by the likes of <a href="http://www.cse.org/local/tx/" target="_new">Texas Citizens 
for a Sound Economy</a> and <a href="http://www.tppf.org/">Texas Public Policy 
Foundation</a> (TPPF) may bring Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” to life. Recall 
that “Fahrenheit 451” (the temperature at which paper bursts into flames) depicts 
a society where independent thought is discouraged, wall- to- wall television 
and drugs sedate a numb population and “firemen” burn books. 
<p>With a nearly $600 million budget for textbook purchases Texas is second only 
to California and the potential for gutting environmental and social science books 
to their core is frightening. With over 200 social and ecological science books 
up for the review this November the Republican dominated state board of education 
and their “flat earth friends” at TPPF look to eviscerate topics such as global 
warming, acid rain and rampant population growth from textbooks. And if the recent 
past is a mirror of the future, Texas politics may create a firestorm nation-wide. 
<p>This past fall “book nazis” at the TPPF, led by Republican Senator Phil Gramm’s 
wife (Wendy) and Peggy Venable, director of the 48,000 member Texas Citizens for 
a Sound Economy, put several environmental textbooks in their “crosshairs”. Environmental 
Science: Toward a Sustainable Future” published by Massachusetts-based publisher 
Jones and Bartlett was canned due to political “incorrectness”. Ms. Venable stated, 
“the textbook focuses on an environmental crisis that we believe doesn’t exist”, 
she added, “They go into detail saying paganism is better for the environment 
than Christianity.” Apparently Ms. Venable chooses to ignore an 8 million square 
mile ozone hole, a human population that adds a net increase of almost 200,000 
people a day and like her proud president, believes that the 100 plus countries 
attending the “Earth Summit” in South Africa are wasting their time. Two other 
books were suspect: “Environmental Science: How the World Works and Your Place 
in It”, Lebel Enterprises and “Global Science: Energy, Resources, Environment”, 
by Kendall Hunt Publishing. Instead of standing tall for intellectual freedom 
and the noble pursuit of creating an ecologically literate young citizenry, these 
books by profit minded publishers went “belly-up.” They made changes and mortgaged 
off their credibility in the eyes of many in the education field. To his credit, 
Michael Stranz, editor-in-chief at Jones and Bartlett Publishers stood tall and 
defiant. “If there are errors of fact, we will make changes, but we will not make 
changes to adhere to a political agenda.” Apparently the Jones and Bartlett text 
will not been seen in Texas schools and the students and teachers are the real 
losers. Nationwide, Lebel and Kendall Hunt have created a domino effect that bears 
ominous tidings. 
<p>TPPF Education Research Director Chris Patterson gleefully testified before 
the State Board of Education on November 8, 2001, the news was terrifying. She 
glibly explained how major publishers, some of the biggest giants in the academic 
field, have lined up to be co-conspirers in this attempt to censor textbooks. 
Industry giant, Holt, Rhinehart and Winston Publishers were akin to willow trees 
bending in a hard wind. “I want to extend my thanks for [TPPF’s] input into this 
year’s science textbook adoption process…The review done by your organization 
has been a valuable contribution to the overall process of ensuring the best possible 
science learning materials in our schools,” John Lawyer, Senior Vice President. 
Others soon followed: “Texas Public Policy Foundation was willing to work with 
all publishers on the textbook review process to improve the books,” Glencoe, 
McGraw Hill. “We have responded to all of TPPF’s comments, including those classified 
as inaccuracies, bias or omissions, “ Julia Fellows Osborne, Editorial Director, 
Prentice Hall. 
<p>These “purveyors” of the truth should hold their collective heads in shame 
and include an introduction in each book that outlines their “deal with the devil.” 
Emboldened by the success of their search and destroy mission, TPPF will look 
to remove the history from social science books this fall. 
<p>If a “Texas Federation of Republican Women’s Issues and Actions newsletter” 
is any indication of what the 2002-2003 school year is going to spawn…look out. 
Parts read like a noble declaration, “During the last few months, a small group 
of people here in Texas has been fighting valiantly against a dangerous but very 
subtle, threat to our nation from within. These Texas heroes are trying to prevent 
science textbooks from being approved by the State Board of Education that are 
full of error, unsupported extremist environmental bias and the occasional anti-American 
rhetoric.” These folks look to turn America back to the more bucolic times of 
racism, McCarthyism and pure denial of the truth. Along with their friends at 
TPPF and Ms. Venable’s “Sound Economy” clan, the Federation has a list of complaints 
against social science books:
<p> 
<ul>
<li>“Too many” pictures of minorities in books;</li>
<li>Slavery is portrayed “too negatively” in history books;</li>
<li>Women depicted carrying briefcases run counter to their idea of family values;</li>
<li>There is an “anti-settler” bias in many books. </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe Texas history classes should simply watch John Wayne movies to learn 
about those “Indian savages” and “Little Black Sambo” books could put a happy 
face on slavery and years of racial segregation. 
<p>No, what this nation faces is a whole sale “white washing” of environmental 
data and history. If textbooks are neutered, by powerful interests how can our 
children face ecological challenges and make wise problem solving decisions? Will 
we allow our children to ignore the slaughter of over 2 million Native Americans 
in less than 100 years? History cannot be re-written to soothe the conscience 
of those who scoff at an American history tarnished by racism and clandestine 
government follies. Being able to analyze the past and recognizing errors by our 
forefathers makes our nation stronger, not weaker. We all know that the “curse 
of man is that he forgets.” 
<p>Add to this the growing intrusion of multinationals into education: forest 
education by Weyerhaeuser and Project Learning Tree (a pet timber curricula), 
ocean health by Exxon and the non-perils of genetically modified foods by Monsanto 
and the dark vision of “Fahrenheit 451” seems possible. 
<p>A passage from Mr. Bradbury’s book provides a fine summation of the situation. 
“ So now do you see why books are hated and feared? They show the pores in the 
face of life. The comfortable people want only wax moon faces, poreless, hairless, 
expressionless. We are living in a time when flowers are trying to live on flowers, 
instead of growing on good rain and black loam. Even fireworks, for all their 
prettiness, come from the chemistry of the earth. Yet somehow we think we can 
grow, feeding flowers and fireworks, without completing the cycle back to reality.” 
<p>We as parents, defenders of the constitution and the vigilant flame-keepers 
of the light of democracy must rise to meet the challenge. Contact Glencoe, McGraw-Hill, 
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Prentice Hall and RonJon Publishing and demand that 
they act like elders, not obsequious lapdogs to zealots. Contact and become familiar 
with your local board of education and ask about textbook adoption policies. Newspapers 
should be flooded with opinion pieces and “dear editor” pieces urging Texas school 
board officials to climb out of their caves of ignorance and embrace textbooks 
that encourage free thought and debate. School boards nationwide should reject 
the policy of the giant textbook publishers to accommodate the manipulation of 
the truth and knock on the doors of publishers like Jones and Bartlett or others 
who stand behind the data they provide…uncensored and unscripted. 
<p>We should follow the words of Alfred Whitney, “Books won’t stay banned. They 
won’t burn. Ideas won’t go to jail. In the long run of history, the censor and 
inquisitor have always lost. The only sure weapon against bad ideas is better 
ideas.” 
<p>It is easy to sit back and simply state that, “Texas and their book heretics 
can go to hell.” But unless we rise as a collective group, we may share that fiery 
destination with those we so despise. “The hottest places in Hell are reserved 
for those who remain neutral in time of great moral crisis,” Dante Alighieri.
