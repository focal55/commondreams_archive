<p>During his final, frantic -- and ultimately wildly successful -- 
15-states-in-five-days campaign spree, President Bush repeatedly 
exhorted Americans to be "willing to serve something greater than 
ourselves."

<p>But, in truth, it's pretty obvious he didn't really expect us to listen.

<p>As Bill Maher writes in his just released book "When You Ride 
Alone, You Ride with bin Laden": "We were asked to do very little  and we responded. That's the bargain we tacitly make with our 
presidents: We won't ask too much of you, if you don't ask too 
much of us."

<p>And true to form, in speech after speech, the president has been 
asking very little of us. At one stop he recommended we "be a Boy Scout leader or a Girl Scout leader." At another he suggested 
that Americans "put their arm around somebody who hurts and say 
'I love you. What can I do to help you? How can I make your life 
better?'" Unfortunately, he failed to mention what to do when the answer to that question is: "Take you damn arm off of me and get me some affordable health insurance!"

<p>Now I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with being a Boy 
Scout leader or telling people that you love them (even when you 
don't -- by the way, Mr. President, I love you.) Indeed, I'm all 
in favor of these things. But there is a world of difference 
between urging mild, spare-time charity and championing a cause 
that will transform our society. It's the difference between 
flaccid, patronizing stump speech rhetoric and invoking 
patriotism to rally us as a nation to a common mission.

<p>In 1961, John F. Kennedy stood in front of a joint session of 
Congress and laid out a vision for the future: "I believe this 
nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the 
decade is out, of landing a man on the moon." He used his bully 
pulpit to gather the political will to meet a monumental 
challenge -- and backed it up with financial muscle. Eight years 
later after a mobilization of resources, exceptionally talented 
people, and that extremely American can-do quality, we achieved 
the science fiction goal when Neil Armstrong bounced across the 
lunar surface. People, no doubt, still told each other "I love 
you," but love doesn't get you to the moon.

<p>So what if President Bush were to use his newly-won political 
power to do the same -- to call on the American people to commit 
themselves to a large, collective purpose? There's no shortage of needs. I have two that immediately come to mind.

<p>He could borrow President Kennedy's language and call on the 
nation to "commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of becoming completely independent of foreign oil." Or he  can call on the nation to "commit itself to achieving the goal,  before the decade is out, of closing the ever-widening gap between the children growing up with hope for the future and 
those growing up in despair."

<p>Okay, I realize that, given the president's oily background, 
there is probably very little chance of his choosing the first 
cause even though the cause of energy independence seems to offer plenty of opportunity for an oil industry willing to harken, no 
pun intended, back to its energetic wildcatting roots. But what 
about the second goal? After all, he and his wife have already 
shown an interest in the subject.

<p>Last week, over 1,000 people gathered in Washington to celebrate 
25 years of Communities In Schools (CIS), a remarkable 
organization that has turned around the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of at-risk children throughout the country.

<p>Among the group's high-profile supporters is First Lady Laura 
Bush, who has praised CIS as "a terrific model for people who 
want to make a difference. It's an organization that has proven 
for 25 years that they can turn kids on to learning by turning 
them on to life."

<p>Bill Milliken, CIS's founder, was himself a troubled kid growing 
up in Pittsburgh in the 50s. He's now putting into practice the 
national exhortation Bush has yet to make. "Our communities have 
been blown apart," Milliken told me, "and we have kids running 
around looking for help. We're responding to this by bringing 
caring adults into one central location -- the schools -- to meet the children's unmet needs. Our work is based on the belief that programs don't change kids -- relationships do."

<p>Communities In Schools currently has over 45,000 volunteers 
working in 2,550 schools -- putting in 1.8 million hours a year. 
Those are impressive numbers -- until you consider the magnitude 
of the problem: There are over 96,000 public schools and roughly 
13 million at-risk children.

<p>And that's where the power of the presidency comes in. We cannot 
go from where we are to where we need to be with individual acts 
of charity and touchy-feely speeches alone. To create the critical 
mass that will truly transform the lives of a generation of 
children, we need to make a Manhattan Project-level commitment of resources and resolve.

<p>So let's strike a new bargain with our leaders: We will expect a 
lot more of them and we're ready for them to ask a lot more of 
us. President Bush claims to believe in the country. So why 
doesn't he believe in us?</p>
