<p>Tony Blair's "dossier" on Iraq is a shocking document. Reading it can only 
fill a decent human being with shame and outrage. Its pages are final proof &#150; 
if the contents are true &#150; that a massive crime against humanity has been 
committed in Iraq. For if the details of Saddam's building of weapons of mass 
destruction are correct &#150; and I will come to the "ifs" and "buts" and "coulds" 
later &#150; it means that our massive, obstructive, brutal policy of UN sanctions 
has totally failed. In other words, half a million Iraqi children were killed 
by us &#150; for nothing.</p>
<p>Let's go back to 12 May 1996. Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, 
had told us that sanctions worked and prevented Saddam from rebuilding weapons 
of mass destruction (WMD). Our Tory government agreed, and Tony Blair faithfully 
toed the line. But on 12 May, Mrs Albright appeared on CBS television. Leslie 
Stahl, the interviewer, asked: "We have heard that half a million children have 
died. I mean, that's more than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price 
worth it?" To the world's astonishment, Mrs Albright replied: "I think this is 
a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it."</p>
<p>Now we know &#150; if Mr Blair is telling us the truth &#150; that the price 
was not worth it. The price was paid in the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
children. But it wasn't worth a dime. The Blair "dossier" tells us that, despite 
sanctions, Saddam was able to go on building weapons of mass destruction. All 
that nonsense about dual-use technology, the ban on children's pencils &#150; 
because lead could have a military use &#150; and our refusal to allow Iraq to 
import equipment to restore the water-treatment plants that we bombed in the Gulf 
War, was a sham.</p>
<p>This terrible conclusion is the only moral one to be drawn from the 16 pages 
that supposedly detail the chemical, biological and nuclear horrors that the Beast 
of Baghdad has in store for us. It's difficult, reading the full report, to know 
whether to laugh or cry. The degree of deceit and duplicity in its production 
speaks of the trickery that informs the Blair government and its treatment of 
MPs.</p>
<p>There are a few tidbits that ring true. The new ammonium perchlorate plant 
illegally supplied by an Indian company &#150; which breached those wonderful 
UN sanctions, of course &#150; is a frightening little detail. So is the new rocket 
test stand at the al-Rafah plant. But this material is so swamped in trickery 
and knavery that its inclusion becomes worthless.</p>
<p>Here is one example of the dishonesty of this "dossier". On page 45, we are 
told &#150; in a long chapter about Saddam's human rights abuses &#150; that "on 
March 1st, 1991, in the wake of the Gulf War, riots (sic) broke out in the southern 
city of Basra, spreading quickly to other cities in Shia-dominated southern Iraq. 
The regime responded by killing thousands". What's wrong with this paragraph is 
the lie is in the use of the word "riots". These were not riots. They were part 
of a mass rebellion specifically called for by President Bush Jr's father and 
by a CIA radio station in Saudi Arabia. The Shia Muslims of Iraq obeyed Mr Bush 
Sr's appeal. And were then left to their fate by the Americans and British, who 
they had been given every reason to believe would come to their help. No wonder 
they died in their thousands. But that's not what the Blair "dossier" tells us.</p>
<p>And anyone reading the weasel words of doubt that are insinuated throughout 
this text can only have profound concern about the basis for which Britain is 
to go to war. The Iraqi weapon program"is almost certainly" seeking to enrich 
uranium. It "appears" that Iraq is attempting to acquire a magnet production line. 
There is evidence that Iraq has tried to acquire specialized aluminum tubes (used 
in the enrichment of uranium) but "there is no definitive intelligence" that it 
is destined for a nuclear program"If" Iraq obtained fissile material, Iraq could 
produce nuclear weapons in one or two years. It is "difficult to judge" whether 
al-Hussein missiles could be available for use. Efforts to regenerate the Iraqi 
missile program"probably" began in 1995. And so the "dossier" goes on.</p>
<p>Now maybe Saddam has restarted his WMD program Let's all say it out loud, 20 
times: Saddam is a brutal, wicked tyrant. But are "almost certainly", "appears", 
"probably" and "if" really the rallying call to send our grenadiers off to the 
deserts of Kut-al-Amara?</p>
<p>There is high praise for UN weapons inspectors. And there is more trickery 
in the relevant chapter. It quotes Dr Hans Blix, the executive chairman of the 
UN inspection commission, as saying that in the absence of (post-1998) inspections, 
it is impossible to verify Iraqi disarmament compliance. But on 18 August this 
year, the very same Dr Blix told Associated Press that he couldn't say with certainty 
that Baghdad possessed WMDs. This quotation is excised from the Blair "dossier", 
of course.</p>
<p>So there it is. If these pages of trickery are based on "probably" and "if", 
we have no business going to war. If they are all true, we murdered half a million 
Iraqi children. How's that for a war crime?</p>
