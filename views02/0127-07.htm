Let's see. In two weeks Enron has gone from being "part of the genius of 
capitalism" (Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill on Fox TV) to "outrageous . . . 
an indictment of the free market" (an unnamed Republican strategist "close to 
the White House" in the New York Times).
<P>Now, thanks to his mother-in-law, even the president is shocked -- shocked -
- to discover what Enron employees told Congress a month ago, that "a lot of 
shareholders didn't know all the facts."
<P>Personally, I prefer the description of the Enron debacle by William 
Greider, national affairs correspondent for the Nation and a 35-year veteran 
of economics reporting:
<P>"Enron, accompanied by a supporting cast from banking, accounting and 
Washington politics, is a virtual pinata of corrupt practices and betrayed 
obligations to investors, taxpayers and voters."
<P>Greider's essay, "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0118-08.htm">Crime in the Suites</a>" in the Feb. 4 issue of the Nation, 
is a must-read for anyone who seeks a solid, easy-to-comprehend primer on just 
how something as big and bad as Enron came to be. It also will provide some 
affirmation to folks who've grown ill from witnessing the obscene and immoral 
excesses of an unchecked, increasingly under-regulated, free-market economy.
<P>For people like us, people who believe that capitalism is like fire -- a 
marvelous and useful force, as long as you keep it under tight supervision and 
control -- the terrible treats now tumbling from the Enron pinata confirm what 
we've said all along. As Greider puts it:
<P>"The rot in America's financial system is structural and systemic. It 
consists of lying, cheating and stealing on a grand scale . . . Enron ought to 
be seen as the casebook for fundamental reform."
<P>But, Lordy, what a task that reform will be. Where do you start? The rot 
has not simply been allowed to spread, it has been deliberately cultivated and 
encouraged to eat through walls and foundations in Washington and on Wall 
Street. As each new Enron revelation proves, the rot runs so deep and wide, 
it's hard to find anyone uncontaminated enough to whom the clean-up can be 
entrusted.
<P>Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who now chairs Senate hearings on Enron?
<P>Never mind that he's one of 71 U.S. senators who gladly gobbled up campaign 
contributions from Enron. As the New York Times reported last week, "At least 
twice in the last eight years (Lieberman) led efforts sought by the accounting 
industry to derail stricter accounting rules on stock options."
<P>Oh, those accountants. Of all the erroneous notions to be squashed by 
falling debris from the Enron pinata, a trustworthy accounting industry is 
perhaps the flattest. Enron -- and Lincoln Savings and Loan, Global Crossings, 
Lucent, and Cendant Corp., et al., ad nauseam -- could not have pulled off 
such monster-truck-scale deceptions without major help from their 
accountant/auditors.
<P>Thanks to the Enron scandal, we grunts outside of the Beltway and Big 
Business now know that, since 1990, accounting firms like Arthur Andersen 
poured more than $53 million into the campaigns of candidates for president 
and Congress. Nearly a quarter of that money materialized in 2000 alone; not 
one of the so-called Big Five firms missed making George W. Bush's Top 20 
presidential campaign contributors' list.
<P>How about the Securities and Exchange Commission? Can we turn to that 
august regulatory body in good faith for help with reform? Well, only if we're 
not bothered by the fact that the new SEC chairman, Harvey Pitt, practiced law 
in a firm whose clients include all of the Big Five and good old insider 
trading king, Ivan "Greed is good" Boesky.
<P>And let's not even start on the SEC's role in carving up the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, especially for Enron, so that the company could run wild 
off-shore with some of the worst of its 881 "subsidiaries".
<P>No, sir. When it comes to the disgusting -- and systemic -- contents of the 
Enron pinata, the energy company's once-proud slogan probably sums it up best: 
"Endless possibilities."
