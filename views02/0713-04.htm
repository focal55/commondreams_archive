<p>Another day, another corporation caught cooking its books. Why should workers 
support better regulation of corporations and the super-rich in the U.S.? 
<p>Because regulating elites is a move towards a more humane future. That’s why. 
<p>Yet this should only be a short-term strategy. Please allow me to explain. 
<p>In the U.S., there currently is a mix of financial speculation and political 
machinations. The national air is thick with hope and fear. 
<p>On the one hand, there is conflict. On the other hand, a resolution is hard 
to see. 
<p>Meanwhile, the wave of financial scandals may be politically clearing the air. 
The daily disclosures of financial fragility could help to build a new politics 
of popular participation. 
<p>Against this backdrop, revelations of elites’ decadence appear to be spurring 
a political awakening of sorts. Is it an exaggeration to say that much rides on 
the emergence of the public’s political consciousness past solutions from the 
official sources in Washington and on Wall Street? 
<p>To be sure, many working people have good reason to be fearful. Millions of 
them who have become involved in financial speculation, now a sour place to be. 
<p>Case in point is U.S. workers’ retirements in 401(k) accounts, plummeting downward 
as stock prices sink. Sadly, this pension thievery began long before the current 
market swoon. 
<p>Then there are high-tech workers who have been paid in company shares. Those 
prices have plunged, leaving many holding a lightened portfolio. 
<p>Markets aren’t perfect. But during the recent boom phase their perfection was 
an article of faith, no less. 
<p>The Christian Science Monitor editorialized on July 9 that, “Investors will 
return to the market if Congress gets it right.” But there’s much less here than 
meets the eye. 
<p>Better regulation to restore investor confidence won’t change the nature of 
financial markets. Their rise, after all, came after U.S. elites squeezed workers 
through deregulation, downsizing, outsourcing and union-busting. 
<p>This redistributive trend gave new life to financial speculation, which rose 
like a phoenix from the ashes of U.S. workers’ shattered lives. Financial markets 
cheered when jobs disappeared, leaving elites with more cash to bid up share prices. 
<p>But all parties, financial and otherwise, come to an end. In fact, the bursting 
of the U.S. market bubble was foreshadowed by events abroad. 
<p>During the 1990s, U.S. elites led by the Clinton administration managed to 
confine financial crises to foreign shores. Crashes in Mexico, Southeast Asia 
and Russia “managed” by the IMF and World Bank were cases in point. 
<p>Busts abroad were a boom for some. Financial speculators such as George Soros 
made billions by profiting from the devaluation of nations’ currencies, causing 
much misery for workers and their families. 
<p>Which brings us back to the short-term, re-regulating U.S. elites to prevent 
further theft of wealth from working people via financial speculation. This is 
a necessary, yet contradictory, step. 
<p>It will likely be taken by the political class that serves immense wealth to 
protect it. They will do it, of course, in the name of those whose work makes 
the market economy function. 
<p>The governments that protect the few can, if pressured, also cushion the public 
from the harshness of the market. In the U.S., the New Deal during the Great Depression 
is proof of that. 
<p>But in our time, the popular forces whose politics made the New Deal happen 
are nowhere to be seen. But that could change, given the dynamic instability of 
the market economy, emerging before our eyes. 
<p>The seeds of such a popular politics exist. Demonstrations against corporate-led 
globalization and racial profiling are two examples that come to mind. 
<p>At any rate, it isn’t in the majority’s long-term interest to settle for legislation 
to make elites engaged in financial speculation more “honest.” Politically, the 
term is an evasion. 
<p>Corporations and rich people control society’s institutions, financial and 
otherwise, to accumulate more wealth by exploiting others. Honesty has nothing 
to do with it. 
<p>Government regulation is a means, not an end, to get public control of how 
people make the world they live in. The alternative is business-as-usual for elites. 
<p>They have every reason to maintain the status quo to amass more wealth that 
won’t be used to meet people’s basic needs. It’s time to think about how to change 
these social relations, to make the politically impractical become practical.
