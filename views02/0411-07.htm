<i> "You see, I stand in good relation to all that is beautiful."</i>
                            - from a poem by N. Scott Momaday

<p>This past week in D.C., the cherry blossom season peaked and is slowly 
ending.  Everywhere, branches raise swaying limbs coated tip to trunk with 
creamy blossoms.  This is what is real:  the single perfect pink-white 
cluster springing directly from the dark raw silk trunk of the cherry tree, 
just because.  Beauty, wherever we can find it, for the moment that it's 
granted. 

<p>Images from here, from there:  In Bethlehem, a woman weeping because the 
wounded man who sheltered in her home for a night, and immediately became her 
family, bled to death on her kitchen floor.  Ambulances are not allowed in 
Sharon's Operation Enduring Freedom.  In Washington, asked about the crisis 
in the Middle East and the rising price of oil, the White House said it sure 
showed the Senate needs to sign the president's energy plan.

<p>We stand in good relation to all that is beautiful.

<p>Our "war on terrorism," for example.  What we find beautiful includes Lady 
Liberty lifting her torch for immigrants, for the poor and the oppressed.  
Yet the war has put a blanket over the torch with secret imprisonments, 
selective rights for people on trial, and massive police roundups of 
immigrants.  What we find beautiful is the hope that America will be the 
voice for human rights everywhere.  Yet we're aligning with whoever will aid 
the "war," regardless of their rights abuses, and the administration urges 
the Voice of America (the very voice of the land that symbolizes freedom to 
the world) to censor its broadcasts.

<p>Isn't all the carnage that is happening in the world supposed to be for the 
sake of preserving what we love?  These wars we are fighting--Bush's war, 
Sharon's war with our money and weapons--are too crude and cruel and 
indiscriminate for that.  They're simply about killing "them" so that more of 
"us" might live.

<p>This is what is real:  individuals loving their lives.  That is all that we 
have.  It's fragile enough, scarce enough, without wars we don't believe in.

<p>There is a huge divide between the government's reality and our own.  It 
exists to perpetuate itself and its own aims.  But we can separate from it 
philosophically, spiritually, and take a stand.  "You see, I stand in good 
relation to all that is beautiful" isn't a boast.  It's an act of will, 
respect, and self-restraint in order that there will be beauty--reasons to 
live.

<p>It seems as if those leading us into insanity have all the power.  Our 
dissent is "disappeared" from the mainstream media, Congress is nearly 
silent, and Bush takes actions without constitutional authority at every 
opportunity.   But the world changes when beliefs change, regardless of the 
wishes of governments.  This time it may not take massive marches, or riots.  
Thoughts are changing; hearts are changing, quietly, about our relation to 
the earth, to things and to people.  Jim Hightower's Rolling Thunder movement 
is one that seeks to "take back the world."  The passionate, thoughtful words 
of many, many people on Internet sites make it clear there's something like a 
populist wildfire occurring in this country.  And around the world, in the 
midst of soldiers and demonstrators, there are thousands of peace activists.  
There's a sense that the governments of the world, with their love of wars 
and weapons, are on a separate evolutionary track from the people of the 
planet.  

<p>Is it possible in this age for us to control events?  It must be.  The 
conduct of war involves the destruction of everything that means life for the 
"enemy" and, utterly without intending it, for ourselves.

<p>The people taking a separate path are like individually rooted leaves of 
grass.  We have the whole force of the earth with us.  We are more powerful 
than we know.

<p>I propose a populist pledge.  "To all the people of the world (with your 
innocent children, your beloved hills and valleys, your joyful ceremonies, 
your blossoms and branches, your cherished dreams and memories):  'I stand in 
good relation to all that is beautiful."  Including you.

<p>Including you.</p>
