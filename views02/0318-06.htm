Now that Enron has been shunted off the front pages and left to squirm under 
Congressional microscopes, it’s time to rethink how our judicial system can 
most effectively respond to white collar criminals who consciously—or through 
the convenience of willful ignorance— inflict so much harm on so many.  

<p>Given a government whose tax, banking and regulatory codes are in no small 
measure authored by Fortune 500 operatives, it will be a miracle if the 
corporate perps don’t all vanish like white rabbits down ready-made offshore 
loopholes.  But if there’s a shred of integrity left in our republic, 
eventually some of the key players will be found criminally liable, not merely  guilty of reprehensible business practices.  And when that time comes, we 
need be as creative with our punishment as they were with their accounting 
practices.

<p>While the nation waits for the Justice Department to cough up indictments and 
the SEC to grow teeth, it’s safe to say that, over the past few months, 
outrage has been the preponderant response to every new revelation of 
evidence shredding, debt concealing, energy supply manipulating and political 
favor dispensing in the epic spectacle that was Enron. But before we scream 
off with their heads, it’s worth considering that most people who do evil 
things are not inherently evil: they are sick

<p>And greed is but one manifestation of the disease we understand as addiction. 
Anyone who devotes their life to the maniacal pursuit of profit uber alles— 
irrespective of who gets mangled in their wake—is psychologically impaired, 
to say the least.  You cannot cripple the financial lives and futures of 
people who placed their trust in you without having abandoned your own moral 
center (presuming you had one to begin with). 

<p>Should you doubt the perversity of their intentions, recall that these were 
the same men who named their shell corporations Raptor (homage to a bird of 
prey or "one who seizes by force"; tellingly, the root of the word is rape), 
and Condor, a type of vulture, "a person or thing that preys greedily or 
unscrupulously."  And, in the case of Enron, that creature did not feast on 
carrion, but on the still-pulsating viscera of its employees and 
shareholders—a more than symbolic act of cannibalism.

<p>Seen in this light, Enron’s corporate malefactors can rightly be viewed as 
wealth-and-power addicts who need help just as desperately as any stark 
raving crackhead. 

<p>This is not for a moment to suggest that the Enron-Anderson cabal escape jail 
time. On the contrary.  Much as judges remand drunk drivers to AA, so, too, 
should the prison sentences of felonious executives include mandatory 
participation in an applicable 12-step program such as Debtors Anonymous. 
With the support of fellow addicts, they would learn that insatiable greed 
usually masks core insecurity and scarcity issues. Left untreated, these 
psychic wounds can lead to the moral anorexia that characterizes a life of 
corporate crime. Fortunately, given enough years practicing spiritual 
surrender and humble self-scrutiny, most people can been restored to reason 
and eventually return to polite society to serve some useful purpose. 

<p>Essential to this transformation is the making of amends to those that the 
addict has harmed: economic restitution for the human casualties is the 
obvious first step. In the case of Enron, there are enough injured parties to 
constitute numerous class-action lawsuits.  And while I fully support the 
vigorous prosecution of these claims, and the recouping of as many pension 
funds and severance packages as possible, we can do more to vaccinate society 
against the spread of Enronitis.

<p>White-collar criminals who ravage millions of lives at the stroke of an 
accounting pencil need to face their victims, listen to their stories and 
yes, feel their pain. Picture a prison, somewhere in Texas, its visiting area 
overflowing with former Enron employees and their families anticipating a 
good long talk with Messrs. Lay, Fastow and Skilling. Perhaps these sessions 
could be televised so all the world might bear witness to the consequences of 
executive hubris. 

<p>Which naturally invites us to move up the food chain and bring justice—and, 
ultimately, one hopes, healing—to those who drank deep at the beast's tainted 
trough: our Senators, regulators, and the squatters in the White House. Truth 
is: whether it’s cocaine trafficking, insider trading or influence peddling, 
criminal behavior is an outgrowth of some form of psychopathology that begs 
for treatment just as fiercely as it demands jail time. And in a just 
world—the world we must now create—no one would be able to buy their way out 
of either.
