<p>The threat of military action against Iraq is now beginning to dominate Western 
politics. So what light does the long history of Christian thinking on the morality 
of warfare shed on this? 
<P>Some dismiss the 'Just War' tradition as outmoded. But although the context 
has dramatically changed, with nuclear weapons and terrorism, the principles remain 
unchanged. 
<P>Others, understandably but wrongly, see this tradition only as a spurious device 
for justifying military action which would be undertaken anyway. 
<P>What it provides, however, is a set of criteria by which a potential military 
action might be judged morally licit or illicit. If a potential military incursion 
into Iraq is judged morally unjustified, it will in fact be on the basis of criteria 
which have long been part of Just War thinking. 
<P>The first criterion is that there must be lawful authority: and this, in fact, 
means authority at the highest possible level. The logic of this is that in disputes 
between lower authorities appeal can always be made to a higher one for a resolution 
without recourse to war. 
<P>Where there is no higher authority, as in a world composed only of nation states, 
the state has to be judge and jury in its own cause. In our world, however, there 
is the United Nations. However imperfect the UN may be, it is a crucial sign that 
we are groping our way towards a truly international authority. 
<P>There were clear UN resolutions to use force to expel Iraq from Kuwait; to 
preserve the no-fly zones in Bosnia; for the United States to act under Article 
51, the right of self defense, in Afghanistan; to intervene in Sierra Leone and, 
more ambiguously, in Kosovo. But what of an invasion of Iraq now? President Bush 
and our own Prime Minister will no doubt appeal to the UN resolutions already 
in force about the terms of the original ceasefire and argue that a build-up of 
weapons of mass destruction is a breach of the ceasefire which justifies military 
action being taken. 
<P>I do not believe this is authorization enough to justify an invasion aimed 
at toppling Saddam Hussein. For such military intervention to meet the criterion 
of lawful authority, a new mandate needs to be sought and agreed by the United 
Nations. 
<P>Second, there must be just cause. When the UN inspectors were expelled from 
Iraq in 1998, it appeared that Resolution 687 relating to weapons dismantlement 
had been partly implemented. There was no indication of any weapons-usable nuclear 
materials remaining in Iraq. There was no evidence that Iraq was manufacturing 
or testing indigenous ballistic missiles. Most of the prime chemical weapons development 
and production complex had been dismantled. 
<P>Much less progress had been made in relation to biological weapons. International 
experts reporting in 1998 said that Iraq disclosures on biological weapons were 
'incomplete, inadequate and technical flawed'. 
<P>Inevitably, it is very difficult to discover what has happened since 1998. 
Defectors earlier reported a network of bunkers where chemical and biological 
weapons have allegedly been made and where attempts were underway to create a 
nuclear bomb. 
<P>More recently the US Congress was told that Saddam Hussein has enough weapons-grade 
uranium for three nuclear bombs by 2005. Tony Blair has said that a full report 
will be published of the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction but 
so far nothing has been forthcoming, allegedly because it would not be seen to 
justify military action. 
<P>But is the presence of weapons by themselves, however destructive, even in 
the hands of someone who certainly cannot be trusted, sufficient cause? A policy 
of containment and deterrence has worked up until now. There is no evidence that 
has yet been produced which would justify a change in policy. 
<P>Third, every effort must have been made to resolve the dispute first by peaceful 
means. This suggests a clear moral obligation to go on pressing for the re-admittance 
of UN Weapons Inspectors into Iraq. We should not yet give up on this. Even if 
Saddam Hussein's present initiative to discuss the issue further does not bear 
fruit, we should persevere. 
<P>Fourth, a judgment has to be made that the war will not unleash more evils 
than are already being endured. Here it is possible to paint an apocalyptic scenario, 
with the whole Middle East in flames, as King Abdullah of Jordan has recently 
stressed, despotic regimes in Islamic countries being toppled and Iraq dismembered 
and in a state of civil war. 
<P>Some predicted such dire consequences over an attack on Afghanistan - and were 
proved wrong, as the doyen of military commentators, Sir Michael Howard, had the 
grace to acknowledge. But most of the factors which made success possible in Afghanistan 
are missing in relation to Iraq. 
<P>Fifth, and arising out of the fourth criterion, there must be a reasonable 
chance of success. But if we are to evaluate success then the war aims must be 
crystal clear. This is far from being the case, with endless possible scenarios 
being played out in Washington. 
<P>Although the Just War criteria were formulated by Christian thinkers in a Christian 
culture, they do in fact appeal to basic moral considerations shared by all human 
beings. It is this that accounts for the fact that they provided the basis for 
international law and the military law of most countries. 
<P>It is also clear that moral principles and political judgments are inextricably 
intertwined. Political and military judgments are also moral judgments and moral 
judgments cannot be separated from an assessment of the consequences of any proposed 
course of action. 
<P>The main task of the Churches at a time like this is to put forward and press 
these criteria, probing and testing whether or not they might be met. In the end 
political and military judgments have to be made and those who hold power have 
the awesome task of making them. Churchmen do not hold power and do not have to 
make those decisions. But on the basis of what we have and know at the moment 
those criteria are not being met.
