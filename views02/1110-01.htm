<p>Would you like a different outcome to the Vietnam War? You can buy a video 
simulation game called Escalation and try. 
<p>Want to become a skilled sniper? You can do that for free. "America’s Army", 
an online video game developed by the Army, is available free online or from recruiting 
offices. It already has 950,000 registered users, with as many as half a million 
players on weekends. 
<p>Players of "America’s Army" go through basic training and learn how to fire 
Army machine guns and rifles. After that, the game becomes a First Person Shooter 
in which players become snipers, viewing the world along the barrel of a gun, 
shooting at terrorists who are trying to shoot them. 
<p>The biggest war game in history, Millennium Challenge 2002, was recently completed 
by the Pentagon. It was partly real maneuvers of 13,500 soldiers on the ground, 
partly computer simulation of actions the Persian Gulf. The Blue forces (U.S.) 
battled the Reds -- an unspecified Middle Eastern nation with a crafty, megalomaniac 
dictator (guess who). It lasted three weeks and cost $235 million. It also generated 
a lot of controversy that never reached prime-time TV. 
<p>Red forces commander General Paul Van Riper took seriously his assignment to 
challenge the high-tech weapons systems and concepts of the Defense Department’s 
"New World of Warfare". First he circumvented the Blue’s state of the art electronic 
eavesdropping techniques by using motorcycle couriers and muezzins chanting from 
minarets for communications. Then he mobilized civilian speedboats to deliver 
explosives to warships, sinking 16 of them and killing thousands of Marines. 
<p>But when he discovered that Pentagon referees, in order to improve the outcomes 
of the games, had refloated the Blue fleet and resurrected the Marines, he quit 
the game in protest. 
<p>"... it was advertised up front as free play" said Van Riper, "in order to 
validate the concepts they were trying to test, to see if they were robust enough 
to put into doctrine." 
<p>Since then the Pentagon has held mock battles simulating urban warfare in Baghdad, 
civil authorities are modeling traffic flow in Washington after a bomb explodes 
at Union Station, and intelligence agencies are tracking the sales of cough syrup 
as possible indicators of bio-terrorism 
<p>Last Sunday in Yemen a single vehicle carrying six men supposed to be Al Qaeda 
operatives was incinerated by a single Hellfire missile from an American Predator 
aircraft. The Predator, a remote-controlled spy plane that can prowl at 15,000 
feet and transmit live video, infrared, or radar pictures, is not one of the Defense 
Department’s new toys -- it’s the CIA’s. 
<p>The Bush administration praised the strike, with Rumsfield saying that the 
death of an Al-Qaeda operative was "a good thing." "We're at war with Al Qaeda," 
said another senior official. "If we find an enemy combatant, then we should be 
able to use military forces to take military action against them." 
<p>Most of the rest of the world sees the attack as an assassination or summary 
execution, exactly like the targeted killing of Palestinians by Israelis, which 
the U.S. has criticized. The Swedish foreign minister noted: ''Even terrorists 
must be treated according to international law, otherwise any country can start 
executing those whom they consider terrorists." 
<p>So here we are, at the start of the 21st century -- when we supposed that our 
highest human ideals of life, liberty, justice, and prosperity for all would be 
realized -- mired in desires, designs and devices for war, killing, destroying, 
and inflicting pain for power or profit. 
<p>The "New World of Warfare" is already in place; the resources and the attention 
of the U.S. are being channeled into ever-more-sophisticated systems for war, 
and miltary "doctrine" is being promulgated for the nation. 
<p>There is little doubt that the U.S. military and CIA can "win" any battle, 
or any war, or kill any Bad Guys they choose. We have the hardware, the software, 
the wetware, the imagination, the will, and the money to shape the world any way 
we want it, and to modify or destroy almost any natural or cultural system, including 
persons, civilizations (if any), and food chains. 
<p>But should we? Now that the capability to compass and consummate the death 
of anyone, anywhere, is within the reach of any nation, any agency, any religious 
sect, or even any single wealthy megalomaniac, does it mean we revert to our crudest 
values and vigilante justice? 
<p>There are no universal, overriding moral standards that could constrain such 
actions. Though all the world’s major religions denounce killing and violence 
and propose something on order of the Golden Rule, in practice most of them have 
prevailed by killing those they define as "evil". 
<p>The Bush administration spends about a million dollars a day on war simulations, 
but that’s small compared to the $1 billion a day of their total military budget. 
Do Americans concur? Are we willing to fight for life, liberty and justice, or 
only against evil? Would we spend as much on simulations and games to learn how 
to reduce human population, or develop cheap, renewable, non-polluting energy 
sources, or make peace between Israel and Palestine? 
<p>Were these sophisticated simulations, games and high-tech weapons developed 
in response to our values and ideals? Or are they driving our thinking about war 
and power? 
<p>As in "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."?
