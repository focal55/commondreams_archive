<p>For me, it's as if I'm reliving what was happening in the Pentagon in 1964 
and 1965. This time, for awhile, it looked like the Democrats were ready to resist 
another Gulf of Tonkin (1964) resolution -- which got us into Vietnam -- but in 
the end they caved. So, now we have Tonkin Gulf II, with key phrases like "as 
the president determines" and "all necessary measures." That's an absolutely blank 
check, just like the Tonkin Gulf resolution. Only the place names have changed. 
<P>The people who voted for President Bush's resolution, especially the Democrats, 
covered themselves in shame. They voted away their exclusive war powers to a president 
who this time -- and this is different from 1964 -- they know is going to use 
the resolution for war. They won't have the excuse this time that they were lied 
to, like Lyndon Johnson, who promised that he had no intention of going to war 
without coming back to Congress for a more specific resolution. Senator Robert 
Byrd, D-W.Va., said he has felt ashamed and guilty for 38 years for voting for 
the Tonkin Gulf resolution. 
<P>It was equally shameful that 75 senators went against Byrd and voted to close 
off the debate on Iraq, even though they know in their hearts that Byrd and (Sen. 
Edward) Kennedy, D-Mass., and the others who voted against it are right -- that 
going to war with Iraq increases our risks of terrorism, strengthens al Qaeda's 
recruiting efforts and reduces the ability of Muslim countries to cooperate with 
us against al Qaeda, even if they wanted to. 
<P><b>THE REAL MOTIVE FOR WAR</b> 
<P>It's not about stopping proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, like 
the administration claims -- Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld know better than that. The real reason is right there, like the 
purloined letter, though saying it stamps you as some kind of vulgar radical or 
cynic. Oil. This war is going to be not just for Iraq's oil but to strengthen 
our control of Saudi Arabian oil, and eventually Iranian oil and Kuwaiti oil. 
War for oil is not some radical slogan, it's a simple statement of reality. The 
administration thinks that kind of control of the world's resources makes war 
worthwhile, but they're not putting that out to the public. 
<P>What they are holding out is an image of empire that in this chaotic world 
looks rather attractive to a lot of Americans. But the lesson of Sept. 11 is that 
it's going to be a very bloody business. That's not to say anything in favor of 
the people or causes behind Sept. 11. But the fact is, killing innocent civilians 
in a Muslim country is going to lead to reaction that costs American lives as 
well. It's wrong of us to even think about waging an aggressive war under these 
conditions. 
<P><b>WHAT CAN BE DONE</b> 
<P>If people in the administration and the Pentagon can hear me, indirectly or 
directly, I urge them to consider that if they know of untruths; if they know 
of false arguments being made; if they know, from documents passing their hands, 
that the country is being deceived into a reckless war, then they should considering 
doing what I wish I had done in 1964 and 1965, rather than waiting till 1969 and 
1971: Going to Congress with the documents, and to the press, and telling the 
truth.</p>
<P><i>Daniel Ellsberg is a former Pentagon official who in 1971 leaked a 7,000- 
page study to the press that detailed American involvement in Vietnam. The release 
of the study, which became known as the Pentagon Papers, set in motion a chain 
of events that helped lead to the resignation of President Nixon and the end of 
the Vietnam War. Ellsberg, who lives in Berkeley and Washington, D. C., is the 
author of the just published Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers. 
He is scheduled to speak tonight at 8 p.m. at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium, 
in a speech co-sponsored by the World Affairs Council of Northern California and 
the Independent Institute of Oakland.</i></p>
