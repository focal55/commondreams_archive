Has the 1996 welfare reform law helped poor people in America wean 
themselves from cycles of dependency?  President Bush thinks so.

<p>The nation’s old welfare system was "an enemy of individual effort and 
responsibility, with dependence passed from one generation to the next," the 
president said Feb. 26.

<p>A Feb. 27 New York Times article described Bush’s remarks partly as “vintage 
compassionate conservatism.”  Is this a little like the recent compassion of 
the president and Congress towards corporate America, including the $15 
billion bailout to big airlines?

<p>By 2007 Bush wants to more than double the number of welfare recipients 
mandated to work.  The unexamined assumption is that earning wages helps 
people to escape poverty.

<p>Reality is somewhere else.  Consider what the Economic Policy Institute 
found in a 2001 study, Hardships in America: The Real Story of Working 
Families.

<p>EPI researchers discovered that the basic family budget levels of 29 percent 
of U.S. families failed to cover their basic needs as set in their 
communities.  The basic needs were the costs of food, medical care and 
shelter, etc., with no money budgeted for dining out, entertaining, savings 
or vacationing (www.epi.org).

<p>There's more.  “The study showed that the number of poor people in this 
country is actually two and-a-half-times as many as the official government 
poverty line identifies,” noted economist John Rowntree.  Recall that 
America, the most militarily powerful nation now and in history, led the 
developed world in rates of child poverty before welfare reform.

<p>What’s the bottom line?  The president’s free market solutions to poverty 
are the problem because there are not jobs for all people that pay a livable 
wage.

<p>The free market is like no other.  How, you ask?

<p>People are free to enter into contracts to sell their labor-power to buyers. 
  The same sellers have also been freed from the ability to provide for 
themselves.

<p>Labor-buyers are free to keep the value they gain from purchasing 
labor-power.  The more people selling their labor-power the better for those 
who purchase it, since the sellers have no choice if they want to continue 
their existence.

<p>The starvation factor is a weapon against workers.  People don’t willingly 
starve themselves.

<p>Forcing more welfare recipients into the market for labor-power increases 
the number of people competing for jobs.  This is supposed to promote 
personal responsibility but actually boosts profitability for buyers of 
labor-power who hold the upper hand when two people are competing for one 
job.

<p>Freedom is illusory when people’s labor-power is a commodity.  This 
commodity is central to capitalism.

<p>A long-term goal is abolishing labor-power as a commodity.  This could place 
people in control of work instead of work controlling them, the current 
practice.

<p>In the short-term, however, we must support progressive changes to welfare 
reform, most of which ends this year and is set to be reauthorized and 
rewritten.  The first Congress of the U.S. Basic Income 
Grant, to be held in New York, March 8-9, may be a step in that direction 
(<a href="http://www.widerquist.com/usbig/announcement.html" target="_new">www.widerquist.com/usbig/announcement.html</a>).
