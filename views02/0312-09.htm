In introducing his 10-point plan for corporate responsibility, President  Bush observed  that "the strength of [our] country depends on the values of  its citizens."  He could not be more right.  However, the problem is most of  America's most powerful citizens, its large corporations, have no values at
 all.   This lack of values is in evidence every time a corporation makes
 money at the expense of the dignity of human beings, the welfare of our  communities or the protection of our environment.

<p>Citizenship in the United States comes in two forms: individual citizenship  (referred to at the outset of the U.S. Constitution as "We the people") and  corporate citizenship which has existed since 1886 when the Supreme Court  decided corporations were entitled to constitutional protection as if they  were citizens.

<p>Corporate interests are now protected by the due process and equal  protection clauses of our constitution.  Large corporations and their trade  associations use their right to free speech to lobby our elected  representatives to the point where many say they control our government.  Yet, most corporations have none of the values of citizens that the  president spoke of as being necessary in order to keep America strong.

<p>To understand why this is so, a brief lesson in corporate law is helpful.  Each of our fifty states has its own corporate law allowing corporations to  be formed and establishing the rules for how such corporations are to  operate.  Each of these laws has something in common with each of the  others.  Each says that the only goal of corporations formed in that  jurisdiction is to maximize profits for shareholders.  In effect, each state  does something for corporations that it does not do for its individual  citizens -- it dictates their purpose.  This purpose, the pursuit of corporate  self-interest, drives all corporate action.  Every act carried out by a  corporate employee can be traced back to this purpose established in the  corporate law.

<p>Unfortunately, the corporate laws of the fifty states do not go on to  provide corporations with values, principals or standards that should be
 adhered to in pursuing the goal of profit.    Consequently, unless
 self-imposed, corporations are devoid of such values.  The problem with  self-imposed values is that they are largely non-binding, can be subject to  legal challenges from shareholders and are often ignored or quickly  discarded in a world of hostile takeovers, mergers and acquisitions and fast  moving, fast talking corporate executives.

<p>In light of the president's observation, the lack of values in our large corporations is extremely troubling.  The question is what to do about it.

<p>Corporate citizens do not have values because we have not yet included them  in the corporate laws.  Such values can be imposed by simply changing the  corporate laws to make it clear the pursuit of corporate profit should no  longer come at the expense of various elements of the public interest  including the environment, human rights, the public safety, the dignity of
 employees and the welfare of our communities.   Until this happens, our
 country will continue to be run by citizens driven only by unfettered  self-interest, citizens without values.

<p>The president is correct, the presence in our citizens of values that show  respect for our fellow human beings and the environment makes America  strong.  The absence of these values, especially in our most powerful  citizens,  tears at the fabric of our society and, eventually, will result  in its undoing.  Corporations have all the rights of citizenship already.  Imposing some of the values and obligations of citizenship should be a top  priority.
