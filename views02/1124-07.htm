<p> If it had happened in the English Channel, the air would have been even thicker 
with denunciation than it has been. Even the committed deregulator Tony Blair 
might have borrowed President Chirac's description of the Prestige as a garbage 
ship and called for a less laissez-faire approach to globalization. As it is, 
even if a large part of its cargo of 70,000 tonnes of oil remains at the bottom 
of the sea, what has already spilled ranks as one of the world's worst environmental 
disasters. 
<P>The Prestige was not just a garbage ship. It has exposed the international 
framework of maritime regulation and attitudes of many shipping companies as garbage 
as well. This was a vessel chartered by the Swiss-based subsidiary of a Russian 
conglomerate registered in the Bahamas, owned by a Greek through Liberia and given 
a certificate of seaworthiness by the Americans. When it refueled, it stood off 
the port of Gibraltar to avoid the chance of inspection. Every aspect of its operations 
was calculated to avoid tax, ownership obligations and regulatory scrutiny. 
<P>This is the more visible aspect of the business dysfunctionality that globalization. 
helps foster - and why those who argue the anti-globalization movement is waning 
could hardly be more wrong. As Pierre Calame, director of the Swiss-based Foundation 
Charles Leopold Mayer for the Progress of Mankind, argued at the EU conference 
on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Copenhagen on Friday, the conclusion 
is almost the opposite. While it may be true that governments have never been 
more in thrall to business and its priorities, out there in civil society the 
very idea of the company is becoming less legitimate. 
<P>It is this mood that has given the corporate social responsibility movement 
its impetus over the past five years. There has been a remarkable growth in leading 
companies making some attempt to account for their social, environmental and wider 
economic policies; an explosion in savings products that promise to invest in 
ethical companies; new kitemarking schemes that allow consumers to buy ethical 
products in the shops; and a new industry evaluating and auditing all the varying 
initiatives. Companies are more mindful that their reputation is a precious asset 
which today's media can destroy in hours. Hence their interest in responding to 
the demand for CSR. 
<P>Even Crown, the Russian trading company whose London office chartered the Prestige, 
must be both alarmed at the size of the compensation suits coming its way as well 
as the irredeemable damage done to its reputation. It will become a business leper. 
Exxon has never fully recovered after the Alaskan oil-spill, and Shell's experience 
with Brent Spar and in Nigeria convinced it to take relations with its stakeholders 
more seriously, becoming an exemplar of best practice in its environmental and 
social reporting. 
<P>There is no doubting the mood. The EU Commission has issued a Green Paper and, 
after 18 months of 'multi-stakeholder forums' like the one in Copenhagen, building 
an EU-wide consensus on the issue, will then set out its proposals. France now 
requires every French company by law to set out its social and environmental policies. 
Belgium has a national kitemarking scheme so that consumers can identify companies 
that follow CSR principles. 
<P>Yet the issue that vexed the plenary session I chaired was whether regulation 
or voluntary acceptance was the best way to embed CSR. The Prestige is a telling 
example. Probably nobody, not even the deregulators in Number 10, believes that 
the voluntary way would ensure that hazardous cargoes are carried safely. Indeed, 
as a rough rule of thumb, there is an indisputable case for regulation on all 
occasions where companies are tempted to make money by taking short cuts and dumping 
costs on others for which they should be responsible themselves. Hence the case 
for regulating oil tankers, polluters, sellers of crooked savings plans and all 
the rest. 
<P>Where the apostles of the voluntary route have a point is when it comes to 
companies' internal cultures; Enron, for example, proudly presented its CSR credentials 
as a giant PR exercise while internally betraying them. Unless companies really 
own CSR it is only window-dressing, argue the voluntarists - and legislation cannot 
help stop criminals or deceivers. The best instrument is to show business that 
behaving well is good business, so that it adopts CSR willingly and internalizes 
it. Critics draw the opposite conclusion; CSR's insecure grip is proof positive 
that capitalism is all the same, the voluntary way is a charade and that we must 
have detailed global regulation. 
<P>I go some of the way with the critics, but not all. The regime of tax havens, 
flags and ports of convenience should be regulated out of existence. Moreover, 
there is a powerful case for following the French and Belgian governments, by 
extending the framework of company law, reporting and ownership duties. But I 
would keep a light touch, focusing on reporting and stewardship obligations and 
not get too prescriptive. It is voluntary action, for example, that has changed 
BP and Shell substantially; they do not need the regulation that the shady characters 
around the Prestige palpably do. 
<P>Yet although the best British companies are world leaders in this area, the 
Government is in a funk. When it took office, it launched a review of company 
law in which introducing CSR was a key component; it has taken a record five years 
to complete its work, under the most intense personal pressure from the Prime 
Minister to water down proposal after proposal. 
<P>The resulting Companies Act, which senior sources in the DTI promised in the 
summer would be in this year's Queens Speech, was not. My understanding is that 
deferral is to allow a further softening; CSR will become wholly voluntary, something 
directors might 'consider' rather than a material 'duty'. 
<P>The Prime Minister, who addressed the private CBI Presidents' Club of business 
leaders in January, declaims privately that this proves his pro-business credentials 
and readiness to outface regulators and the Left alike. It is a major misjudgment. 
The right-of-center Danish, French and Italian governments better understand that 
the friends of business in today's climate are those who help it to secure more 
legitimacy, not those who indulge the temptation to surrender to baser and anti-social 
choices.</p>
