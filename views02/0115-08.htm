<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->George Washington and Abe Lincoln are in a category all to themselves, with their birthdays recognized as both a federal holiday and an occasion for retailers to sell "Presidents Day" goods at prices slightly lower than usual.
<p>
In a country where business is king, only the birthday of a true American fairy-tale-hero is innocuous enough to be celebrated with such corporate fanfare. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. hasn't quite made it yet, even if his "I Have A Dream" speech has been co-opted by the minions of Madison Avenue.
<p>
King does have the distinct honor of having a federal holiday established in his memory, but he <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>has yet to join that elite pantheon of heroes whose lives have been distorted with superhuman attributions - like an inability to tell a lie.
<p>
For posterity's sake, I hope he never reaches those heights - or is it depths? - of popular imagination. Along with that kind of uncritical acclaim comes a diluting of King's humanity, which is, in effect, the diminishing of his still-living potential to inspire.
<p>
Seventy-three years ago today, King was born. So for the next week, I'll hear all kinds of things about how great he was, and about the importance of "keeping the dream alive." But what is the dream?
<p>
If I hadn't been a student of King's life for the past 15 years and had to rely only on the programs offered in school, or most of the King-related public events offered every year at this time, I would think the dream was nothing more than a vision of blacks and whites sitting down at the "table of brotherhood" to sing "Kumbaya," and feeling all warm and fuzzy about each other.
<p>
For American youth of the post-civil rights era, who have seen black rappers and athletes get rich off white consumers, and a black man named Colin Powell coming "that close" to a serious run for the White House, such mealy-mouthed memories of King seem simply irrelevant.
<p>
How can young people connect to King? On the occasions when I've been invited to speak at schools about him, I've found students excited to engage King's life and legacy, once all the "feel-good" rhetoric is dropped.
<p>
Several years ago, a reader wrote me about my admiration for King. "Do you know he was unfaithful to his wife?" But you see, that's what shows King is human, all-too-human - something ordinary people can relate to. Besides, many great men have struggled with their sexual passions - King David, St. Augustine, Tolstoy.
<p>
Exploring these contradictions in relation to King might be an interesting beginning to a bigger discussion on current cultural and political issues, especially for a generation obsessed with sexuality. I have a dream today...
<p>
For a rhythm-loving, hip-hop generation, one of his last sermons - "A Drum Major Instinct" - speaks. King defined the drum major instinct as a belief that one's immediate self-interest should come first. He talked about how nations and even people like himself suffer from this egoistic drive.
<p>
Globally, "the nation we live in is the supreme culprit," he said. America, King felt, had ignored the edict set forth by President Bush's favorite political philosopher, Jesus: "He who is greatest among you shall be your servant."
<p>
How can young people connect to King? By imagining what a conversation between King and President Bush would sound like, with King talking about Jesus and how great individuals and nations are measured by their service to the poor.
<p>
King might talk about how salvation and true service to humanity is inseparable from sacrifice and sometimes suffering. How would Bush respond? Salvation through consumption?
<p>
Just several months before he was assassinated, King said: We "must work out programs to bring the social change movements through from their early and now inadequate protest phase to a stage of massive, active, nonviolent resistance to the evils of the modern system... ." 
<p>
"Our economy must become more person-centered than property-centered and profit-centered (has it?)... . Let us, therefore, not think of our movement as one that seeks to integrate the Negro into all the existing values of American society," but one that would change those basic values.
<p>
King aide Andrew Young added: "Even if you're a winner in a rat race, you're still a rat." WTO and World Bank protest movement?
<p>
The words of Diane Nash are worth pondering: "If people think that it was Martin Luther King's movement, then today they - young people - are likely to say, 'gosh, I wish we had a Martin Luther King here today to lead us... . If people knew how that movement started, then the question they would ask themselves is, 'What can I do?'"
<p>
King Day celebrations are becoming a way for young people to avoid asking themselves that question; implying that ordinary people can't do the extraordinary? That's a nightmare, not a dream.
