<p>CHICAGO -- Before Jose Padilla was locked up on suspicion of plotting a &quot;dirty 
bomb&quot; attack on the United States, he lived in Egypt, hooked up with Osama 
bin Laden&#39;s confederates in Pakistan and Afghanistan and boarded a flight 
home in Switzerland. 
<P> So which country is implicated by his bloodcurdling activities? Why, Iraq, 
of course. 
<P> That was the thinking on The Wall Street Journal&#39;s editorial page, which 
blames Saddam Hussein for everything that it can&#39;t manage to pin on Bill Clinton. 
<P> After the news broke on Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al Muhajir, the 
Journal trotted out a former Iraqi official who wrote, &quot;The arrest of a &#39;dirty 
bomb&#39; suspect in Chicago has focused attention once again on al-Qaida. But 
it would be a mistake to ignore possible state links, especially with Saddam Hussein.&quot; 
<P> The author, Khidhir Hamza, recalled that when he was head of Iraq&#39;s nuclear 
program in the 1980s, a test was done of a dirty bomb. 
<P> All that was missing in this article was any evidence that Mr. Padilla had 
a connection with Iraq, that Iraq has stockpiled dirty bombs or that Mr. Hussein 
is planning to attack the United States. 
<P> Never mind. &quot;Restricting the lookout for this source of terrorism to 
al-Qaida is taking the easy way out,&quot; warned Mr. Hamza. 
<P> Well, yes. It is taking the easy way out to go after the people who are trying 
to attack you rather than the people who are not. But somehow it makes more sense 
than doing the converse. 
<P> The impulse to use any scare as grounds to attack Iraq has been on display 
since Sept. 11. 
<P> The hawks immediately suspected Saddam Hussein, trumpeting reports that Mohammed 
Atta conferred with one of his henchmen in Prague last year. 
<P> That turned out to be a false lead. After an exhaustive investigation, the 
Los Angeles Times reported last month, &quot;U.S. investigators no longer believe 
that suicide hijacker Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Europe 
last year, eliminating the only known link between Saddam Hussein&#39;s government 
and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.&quot; 
<P> Likewise, when anthrax-tainted letters turned up last fall, suspicions once 
again fell on Iraq. Now, the FBI has pretty much abandoned that notion as well 
-- concluding that the villain was most likely an American who has some scientific 
training and a grudge against the government. 
<P> You&#39;d think the conspicuous lack of evidence tying Saddam Hussein to anti-American 
terrorism would argue against an invasion of Iraq. But the consensus in favor 
of a pre-emptive strike has reached near unanimity in Washington. Democratic as 
well as Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have endorsed such action, and President 
Bush leaves little doubt that he is planning to do whatever it takes to get rid 
of Mr. Hussein. 
<P> &quot;I will not stand by as peril grows closer and closer,&quot; announced 
the president in a recent speech at West Point, in a clear reference to Iraq. 
<P> &quot;If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too 
long.&quot; 
<P> All this is a clever way of getting around a major inconvenience: Mr. Hussein&#39;s 
refusal to provoke us. Even though he has apparently been a mere spectator in 
the war between terrorists and the United States, Mr. Bush says we know he&#39;s 
a bad guy who wants weapons of mass destruction. So he has to be eliminated lest 
he ever acquire the means to attack us. 
<P> But there&#39;s no reason to think Mr. Hussein would attack us if he had such 
armaments. He could have used his chemical or biological weapons in 1991, when 
we were pounding his army to pieces. He didn&#39;t, because he knew we would wipe 
him and his regime off the face of the earth. 
<P> That stark prospect explains his reluctance to join forces with al-Qaida. 
He knows that if we uncover any direct connection between Baghdad and terrorist 
attacks against us, he&#39;ll be as defunct as the pharaohs. 
<P> So Mr. Hussein may be a chronic irritant, but he poses no danger that we can&#39;t 
contain. 
<P> The real danger would arise if we were to launch an invasion of Iraq -- which 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff have informed the president would require some 200,000 
troops. 
<P> Worse, it would erase the one powerful reason Mr. Hussein has not to use any 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons he may possess. 
<P> If he&#39;s going to be destroyed regardless of what he does, why wouldn&#39;t 
he do his worst? 
<P> Therein lies the genius of the hawks&#39; plan for Iraq: It replaces a policy 
that has deterred Mr. Hussein from using weapons of mass destruction with an approach 
that virtually guarantees their use. 
<P> With solutions like that, who needs problems?
