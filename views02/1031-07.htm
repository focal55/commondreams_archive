<p>WASHINGTON, DC - It is becoming increasingly apparent these days that corporate 
reform isn’t really happening in Washington. 
<p>In the last few weeks, we’ve witnessed a below-the-radar rollback of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act, continued corporate earnings restatements, foot-dragging by a Congress unwilling 
to move ahead on the next round of critical corporate reforms, and the continuation 
of brazen Bush administration policies to further deregulate the energy and telecom 
sectors. 
<p>Chances are, though, most people didn’t really notice. That’s because they’ve 
probably been paying attention to the latest developments on Iraq. How cleverly 
Bush has been able to change the subject. 
<p>Whatever happened to all that concern about the more than one million Americans 
who lost their jobs in the cascading corporate scandals? What about the $175 billion 
investors lost in their retirement accounts? Have we forgotten already about the 
despicable behavior by executives at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco? 
<p>Not so fast, say more than 200 groups who this week joined forces to release 
the Unity Platform on Corporate Accountability, a comprehensive outline of specific 
proposals designed to significantly transform the relationship between corporations 
and society. 
<p>The groups, which include Public Citizen, Global Exchange, the Institute for 
Policy Studies, Rainforest Action Network, Co-op America, 50 Years is Enough, 
CorpWatch, the Alliance for Democracy, and Citizen Works, want to make sure corporate 
excess doesn’t go away as an issue until it goes away as a problem. 
<p>The Unity Platform "represents a cohesive analysis shared by diverse strands 
of the grassroots corporate accountability movement," said Charlie Cray, director 
of the Corporate Reform Campaign at Citizen Works. "Despite the inertia in Washington, 
it reflects the popular view that there needs to be further and deeper change 
in how we govern corporations." 
<p>“Corporate greed and abuse remains one of the top issues for most Americans; 
it will be a factor in the elections and will come back strong in the months to 
come,” added John Cavanagh, Director of the Institute for Policy Studies. 
<p>The groups’ agenda calls for public funding of elections, an overhaul of corporate 
governance, controls on speculative investment, stronger labor and environmental 
obligations, an end to international corporate welfare, and a redefinition of 
financial accountability, among other proposals. 
<p>“We should be at a political crossroads today, developing ways to foster real 
corporate accountability,” said Joshua Karliner, Senior Adviser to San Francisco-based 
CorpWatch. “Unfortunately the drum beat of war is drowning out the public outcry 
against corporate corruption. This not only undermines corporate reform, but also 
creates a climate in which Bush's agenda to further deregulate big business, one 
of the principle causes of Enron, may well prevail." 
<p>As Wenonah Hauter, Director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy & Environment 
Program notes: "Despite the crushing failure of telecom and energy deregulation, 
the Bush Administration continues to advocate for increased deregulation of these 
sectors.” 
<p>The groups decided to release the platform this week in response to the disappointing 
corporate reform inertia in Washington to return some energy back into the important 
work of curbing corporate power and greed. 
<p>Such a spark is much needed. After all, consider these recent developments:
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Instead of choosing someone with the relevant skills to head the accounting 
industry oversight board created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Harvey Pitt nominated 
William Webster, the retired CIA and FBI head whom even the Wall St. Journal described 
as “Pitt’s factotum.”<br>
</li>
<li>Bush recently proposed cutting the SEC’s budget from the $776 million targeted 
in Sarbanes-Oxley to $568 million. Even Harvey Pitt has said this will prevent 
the agency from undertaking key initiatives to protect investors.<br>
</li>
<li>Under the guise of simplifying the tax code, the Treasury Department hinted 
to the Washington Post that it is developing plans to scrap the corporate income 
tax altogether and replace it with a regressive value-added tax.<br>
</li>
<li>Although deregulation has cost consumers billions and resulted in the inefficient 
allocation of capital due to fraudulent corporate practices, key Bush Administration 
appointees - Pat Wood at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Michael 
Powell at the Federal Communications Commission – continue to call for increased 
deregulation. “Wood is pushing his Standard Market Design despite the pleas by 
18 states to cease this deregulation nightmare,” says Public Citizen’s Wenonah 
Hauter. “And Powell has publicly stated that much of the $2 trillion meltdown 
in the telecom industry is not the FCC's concern, and instead is pushing for increased 
deregulation of the Baby Bells."<br>
</li>
<li>International financial institutions continue to subsidize irresponsible corporations 
like Enron. In the coming weeks, the U.S. taxpayer-funded Inter-American Development 
Bank is expected to vote on financing $125 million in loans to Enron and Shell 
for a controversial pipeline in Bolivia.<br>
</li>
<li>Congressional foot-dragging has failed to fix even the most obvious problems 
of corporate greed, such as a broken pension system and a wave of corporate relocations 
to offshore tax havens. </li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, little has changed in Corporate America. According to an October 
2002 study of 1,245 US firms by the Investor Research Center, 72% of fees paid 
by firms to their auditors were actually for non-audit services, the same exact 
percentage as one year ago. And the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently reported 
that corporate restatements rose from 225 in 2001 to an estimated 250 in 2002. 
In the last week alone Qwest, AOL, Tyco, MTS Systems, and Bristol-Myers Squibb 
have all announced new restatements.
