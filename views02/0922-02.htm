<p>WASHINGTON &#151; Don't feel bad if you have the uneasy feeling that you're 
being steamrolled. You are not alone.</p>
<P> As my girlfriend Dana said: "Bush is like the guy who reserves a hotel room 
and then asks you to the prom."</p>
<P> As the Pentagon moves troops, carriers, covert agents and B-2 bombers into 
the Persian Gulf, the president, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld continue their 
pantomime of consultation.</p>
When Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota asked the defense chief on Thursday, "What 
is compelling us to now make a precipitous decision and take precipitous actions?" 
an exasperated Mr. Rumsfeld sputtered: "What's different? What's different is 
3,000 people were killed." 
<P> The casus belli is casuistry belli: We can't cuff Saddam to 9/11, but we'll 
clip Saddam because of 9/11.</p>
<P> Mr. Rumsfeld offered sophistry instead of a smoking gun: "I suggest that any 
who insist on perfect evidence are back in the 20th century and still thinking 
in pre-9/11 terms."</p>
<P> Ah, Rummy. Evidence, civil liberties, debating before we go to war . . . it's 
all sooo 20th century.</p>
<P> Anyway, how can we have evidence when we learned last week that our evidence-gathering 
snoozy spooks are even more aggressively awful than we thought?</p>
<P> The administration isn't targeting Iraq because of 9/11. It's exploiting 9/11 
to target Iraq. This new fight isn't logical — it's cultural. It is the latest 
chapter in the culture wars, the conservative dream of restoring America's sense 
of Manifest Destiny.</p>
<P> The Bush hawks don't simply want to go back in a time machine and make Desert 
Storm end with a turkey shoot. They want to travel back even farther to the Vietnam 
War and write a more muscular coda to that as well.</p>
<P> Extirpating Saddam is about proving how tough we are to a world that thinks 
we got soft when that last helicopter left the roof of the American embassy in 
Saigon in 1975.</p>
<P> We can't prove it with al Qaeda. That's like grabbing smoke.</p>
<P> So former Nixon officials Cheney and Rummy are playing out their own "Four 
Feathers," rescuing the lost honor of the American empire in the sands of Arabia. 
They want to stomp on Saddam to exorcise the specters of Vietnam and Watergate 
— the ethical relativism, the lack of patriotism, the postmodern angst, the loss 
of moral authority, the feeling that America is in decline or in the wrong, the 
do-whatever-feels-good Clintonesque ethos.</p>
<P> Dick Cheney fought multinationalism and Lynne Cheney fought multiculturalism, 
defending the dead white males who made the republic great. She has written a 
children's book, "America: A Patriotic Primer," and urged that 9/11 be a day to 
remember the nation's glories rather than its "faults and failings."</p>
<P> The Cheneys, who have been known to invite dinner guests at the vice presidential 
mansion to sing along to "Home on the Range," think they can restore a sunnier, 
more can-do mood to our society. Even if it takes incinerating Baghdad to do it.</p>
<P> Rummy is equally impatient with the post-Vietnam focus on imperfections and 
limitations. He wants to yank the boomers by their collars and make them, if not 
the Greatest Generation, at least a bit Greater.</p>
<P> This is fine with W., who stayed 50's through the 60's and stopped liking 
the Beatles when they got into their "weird psychedelic period." He arrived at 
Yale and Harvard Business School just as the white male WASP ascendancy was slipping. 
He was in that small coterie of bewildered guys in wide-wale corduroy trousers, 
Izod polo shirts and Sperry Topsiders, surrounded by wild and crazy hippies protesting 
the war and smoking roaches.</p>
<P> The Bushies want to bring back the imperial, imperious presidency. The pre-emption 
proclamation had the tone of Cheney Caesar and Condi Ben Her. And the resolution 
sent to Congress seeking authority to go after Iraq was the broadest request for 
executive military authority since L.B.J. got the Gulf of Tonkin resolution rubber-stamped 
in 1964. At least L.B.J. had to phony up the Tonkin Gulf provocation. Mr. Bush 
can't be bothered. "I cannot believe the gall and the arrogance of the White House," 
Sen. Robert Byrd bellowed.</p>
<P> Things are getting dangerouser and dangerouser. Karl Rove's gunning for the 
Democrats. Ariel Sharon's gunning for Arafat. W.'s gunning for Saddam. And Al 
Qaeda's still gunning for us.  </p> </p>
