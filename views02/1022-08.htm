<p>Mohsen Mahkmalbaf, the Iranian new wave film director, published a powerful 
essay in Monthly Review last year called the “Limbs of No Body.” He described 
the destruction of Afghanistan over the last twenty years. The body of the world 
amputated Afghanistan. In this time of digital terror, various email snooping 
and commercial digital data mining technologies have been mobilized by the USA 
Patriot Act. The digital in this paranoid, authoritarian era is being used to 
disembody and to disempower. Today, I want to turn this around to reembody and 
reempower our politics, our analysis, our digitality, our critical art. We must 
resist any and all architectures of disembodiment which remove labor from manufacturing 
in the global economy, war from geography, privacy from security, gender from 
race, dissent from justice. These ideas, and all of us gathered here today, are 
limbs of one body, the phrase over the portal to the United Nations. 
<p>Our choice in this endlessly morphing swirl of phantasmatic 
nationalist discourse is quite simple: we are dead, or we are alive. We 
must issue a call to humanity, not as some universalized abstraction, 
but as a specific dialogic action across and with difference. And we 
must look to the dead, everywhere, not just here, and forge 
connection.  The people dead from AIDS in SubSaharan Africa each day 
equal the dead of two September 11ths. We need to see, to really see, 
and then to see more, through a digital ultrasound of all of the 
complicated, messy, invisible politics that evades us. We can choose: 
we are limbs of no body. Or we are limbs of one body. 
<p>In response to the war resolution vote in Congress yesterday, 
my talk today is about blasting war.  Blasting enfolds within and 
around itself many meanings  from many different historical epochs and 
disciplines. We need to connect the limbs to the body.  Blasto, in 
biology, means embryonic cell formation.  
<p>To blast is to open up, to make, to form.  To blast is to 
proclaim.  To blast is to criticize vigorously.   It describes and 
sounds a process rather than a statement or a thing.  
<p>Mohsen Mahkmalbaf’s timely film, Kandahar, a film blasts our 
imaginary projections of Afghanistan as a place of rubble, death, 
drugs, amputation, murder, bombed buildings–a place of absence. 
Instead, with an expansive, compositional strategy of color, line, form 
it creates a place of presence. The real and the imaginary twist 
together: sand, burqas, poverty, madrassas, people trying to live.  
Prosthetic legs cascade from the sky.  
<p>In Kandahar, a Canadian/Afghani woman journalist journeys into 
Afghanistan to search for her sister. The film genders the nation of 
the mujahadeen and the Taliban through the vision of a diasporic woman. 
It is many stories folded into one. In the final shot, the woman 
journalist looks through the screen of her burqa at a distant city: we 
are inside Afghanistan, we are inside the burqa, we are not reaching 
our destination, we are not ending the story. We are looking out 
through a screen. We are looking beyond ourselves.
<p>To blast is an expression of reprobation. 
<p>USA Today, CNN and President Bush’s speeches declare the 
tragedies of September 11 as a seismic historical shift, where nothing 
is the same after and where history is blasted away like rock in a 
mountain needing removal for a new tunnel. Books on Islam proliferate 
but Islam is seen as separate from the West, whatever that is in this 
post-cold war world.  Books on 911 crowd bookstores but history is 
reduced to therapeutic repetitions. 
<p>History begins, in this view, with the horrific assault on the 
U.S. But as Robert Fisk has pointed out  “ if you talk to a Palestinian 
in Lebanon about the September massacre, he will assume you are 
referring to the slaughter, at the hands of Israel's militia allies, of 
1,700 Palestinians in Beirut in September of 1982".  Arundhati Roy, 
Ariel Dorfman, and Zillah Eisenstein, have reminded us that September 
11 is also the anniversary of the Chilean coup, where 10,000 died, and 
other anniversaries of horrific and wrongful death and genocide, each 
different, each requiring our mourning. Around the world, there are 
many September 11ths, not only one. Iranians killed by Iraqis.  
Guatemalans killed by their government.  Rwandans, Yugoslavians, 
Cambodians, East Timorese, African Americans murdered across many 
Septembers. These deaths surround us with a virtual archive which is 
not spoken, which is invisible, which is not connected.
<p>These dead are the limbs of one body:  When President Bush 
proclaimed you are either with us or you are with the terrorists, he 
blasted away history. His binaries are inoperative in a globalized, 
flexible, borderless economy,  in assymetrical warfare without nation 
states,  and invisible terrorists who blend in as suburbanites 
and “family” men.  As Philip Rosen has argued, a radical historiography 
must replace the pursuit of authentic, immobilized pastness  with a 
dynamic sense of multiple temporalities. These multiple temporalities 
must collide and produce frisson if we are to see anything at all.
<p>The mediated immobilized pastness of mourning 911 throws out an 
anchor to our anxieties. But on 9/12 Bush replaces Osama  with Saddam, 
Afghanistan with Iraq, corporate criminals with war resolutions,  a 
plummeting economy with war, and coalitions with global domination.  
Yet  more than a decade ago in the era just after the Gulf War and the 
end of the Cold War, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Paul Wolfowitz 
outlined exactly the same plan in their Defense Planning Guidance 
Report. They  directed the military to retool for cyber, laser, and 
electronic warfare capabilities to dominate outer space, inner space, 
digital space, private space, domestic space, entertainment space,  
international space, and national space–full spectrum dominance.
<p>War  is no longer debated. It has been shorn from death. It is 
branded. Bush advisor Adam Card declares that the war plans against 
Iraq were delayed until September because you don’t want to introduce a 
new product in August. Yet, since August 6, 1990–the same date as the 
bombing of Hiroshima-the US imposed sanctions on Iraq.  Over 1 million 
Iraqis have died, half of whom are children.  Iraq poses a  question 
for our politics: what is history?  In 2002 alone, the US military has 
executed 30 bombing missions into Iraq.  Will we declare war on Iraq 
when the image marketeers identify a good launch date? Or has the war 
been going on for over a decade anyway and all of Bush’s speeches 
performance art to camouflage the realignment of the US military with 
transnational capital?  By 1992, capital spending on information 
systems exceeded capital spending on industrial age items, such as 
mining, construction and manufacturing equipment. The Department of 
Defense then shifted to an explicit policy of strategic information 
warfare because of the threat of open networks, no borders, and easily 
available software.
<p>To blast is to blow air through the mouth to clear from 
particles.
<p>Slavoj Zizek asks what are we to make of the greatest power in 
the world bombarding one of the poorest countries in the world, 
Afghanistan, as retaliation? He observes that Kabul all ready looked 
like downtown Manhattan after September 11.   The most high tech 
country in the world has bombed a nation with barely any electricity 
and no paved roads.  The Department of Defense briefings explained 
Afghanistan was not “target rich.” The geography of war has been 
reorganized: within minutes of the first bombing of Afghanistan, the US 
repositioned 40 communications satellites over the country and bought 
all satellite time to prevent independent imaging from outer space.
<p>Yet, as US ground forces and CIA agents penetrated, they 
captured not only what they thought were Taliban operatives, but hard 
drives from almost any computer they could find. Yet as Pakistani 
investigative Ahmed Rashid points out US military and oil companies 
have been involved in Afghanistan for twenty years. US popular culture 
imaged the end of the Taliban as a visual couplet between urban Afghani 
women (not all, maybe a few) disposing of their burqas and the 
importation of Indian musicals on video and satellite dishes hammered 
from soup cans.
<p>Several weeks ago, Variety boasted a headline “Post Taliban 
production rebounds.” The article explains that the west–whatever that 
is now-- is no longer limited to Mahkmalbaf’s Kandahar for a point of 
reference. The Locarno Film Festival hosted a Afghan Film Day this 
year.  But the Taliban destroyed 2,700 films in the Afghan film 
archives, a history of analog images incinerated. And just last week, 
the US Consulate denied Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian film director, a 
visa to attend the New York Film Festival.
<p>Afghanistan’s history speaks dismemberment before the US bombings. Over the 
last twenty years, 2.5 million Afghans died from war, militarization, famine and 
lack of medicine. 10% of the population perished. Another 30% migrated to other 
countries in search of food and water. 6.3 million Afghanis are refugees–three 
times the number of ex-yugoslav refugees. People are dying as we sit here today. 
<p>But Afghanistan is not the only history to be rendered 
invisible. It is as though Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak has 
covered the globe like a digital rendering effect in a Disney film. 
Angola is an oil rich country recently visiting by Colin Powell. 
According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, after 27 years of war, 30% of 
the Angolan people are malnourished from famine, with mortality and 
malnutrition rates 5 to 10 times emergency threshold levels for 
international relief agencies.
<p>These histories articulate with the recent actions of Attorney 
General John Ashcroft. He responded to the terrorist attacks by 
arresting 6,000 people in two months with little or no evidence. But 
let us not amputate Ashcroft’s actions from US history: the Palmer 
Raids against Eastern European immigrants and communists in 1917 and 
1918, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, and 
the Red Scare.. The USA Patriot Act, “rammed through Congress” as the 
ACLU describes it with very little debate, expands government power to 
invade privacy, imprison people, and punish dissent (ACLU 2). Under the 
Terrorism, Information and Prevention System, TIPS, the government 
militarizes citizens and service workers to spy on people in their 
homes.  
<p>Law enforcement agents now have a sneak and peek provision to 
enter a house or office with a search warrant when the occupants are 
away, photograph whatever they deem necessary to fight the war on 
terror, and confiscate any communications equipment.
<p>To blast is to bomb, explode. 
<p>Susan Sontag, in a OP ED in the New York Times, wrote that the 
war on terror is a vague, ill-defined misnomer designed to keep us 
engaged in endless war. She says “this is a phantom war and therefore 
in need of an anniversary.” She says we are fighting Al Qaeda, not 
terror. Perhaps war is simply a vacuous invocation and cover for the 
complete reorganization, realignment and mobilization of the state, the 
military, information infrastructures, and transnational capital. 
Several weeks ago, Tom Ridge, head of Homeland Security, not only 
requested exemptions from congressional oversight, but also demanded 
that corporate records and infrastructures be exempted from the Freedom 
of Information Act.  Perhaps an authoritarian coup d’etat  has occurred 
within our own borders.  Perhaps Bush himself is virtual. 
<p>This endless phantom war which is really not war lacks images 
and news: an invisible war.  The Department of Defense has initiated 
the strictest press protocols in US history. Reporters have no access 
to military personnel anywhere independently.  They are covering the 
story from destroyers 2,500 miles away in the Indian Ocean. All images 
must be approved, or are supplied by the DOD.  3D virtuality replaces 
muckraking. CNN is now our collective burqa.
<p>We must rewire for cyberwar.  Bush’s new war, and the wars that 
will follow, will no longer be total wars like World War II, Vietnam or 
the Gulf.  They are, and will be, nodal wars, practiced and perfected 
in the war on drugs in the US and Latin America and the civil wars 
against the cultures of difference and public arts practices. Nodal 
wars are no longer wars of images and propaganda, but are instead about 
the  policing and  circulation of virtuality in assymetrical warfare. 
<p>Since 1989 at the end of the cold war, the military has 
converted to something called Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA). The 
20th century moved wars into the air and off the ground. In the 21 st 
century, war is etherized by digitizing it.  The 1999 bombings of 
Serbia signaled a decisive shift in the military from weaponry to cyber- infrastructure. 1500 bombing sorties required 30,000 computer 
technicians, engineers and analysts.  Now, with the largest military 
contract in US history–$200 billion -- awarded to Lockheed Martin, an 
aircraft manufacturer, there is virtually no difference between planes, 
weapons and computers.  The CIA, for example, has targeted financial 
networks and organizations that might have harbored Al Qaeda money, 
employing the hackers they once pursued for copyright piracy.  The 
Predator, an unmanned spy plane, can also do reconnaissance. Commando 
Solo, a special operations communications plane, drops anti-Osama 
reward leaflets and blasts world beat hip hop music over Afghanistan 
like a mobile rave machine.
<p>Digital technologies developed for the Cold War have now 
migrated into and merged with the entertainment industry. The 
information sector represents 15% of the US economy. Copyright products– film, video, games, software-- are now the largest U.S. export. Firms 
that depended on military financing from the Department of Defense 
moved into special effects, computer design and interactive 
entertainment. 
<p>These digital conversions do not so simply mark a 
technological shift. They signal a political economy reorganization 
from a military industrial complex to the military information media 
entertainment complex.  Last fall, Variety announced that the military 
had convened a group of screenwriters of action and cult films like  
Die Hard, Fight Club, Being John Malkovich to brainstorm terrorist 
scenarios. Yet computer games currently outsell Hollywood films. But 
even more significantly, Michael Powell, son of Colin, was installed as 
head of the FCC.  In the last year, he has peeled back rulings on media 
concentration. He has endangered the diversity of voices and opinions 
on broadband internet, which the ACLU and many US and Canadian media 
rights organizations have dubbed the “free speech issue of the 21st 
century.” Soo-to-be-unregulated media transnationals may control all 
portals and filter content.
<p>In Variety, the network news executives bemoaned how to cover a war with no 
clear enemy, no single location, no beginning, middle or end, no images, no news 
bureaus in Central Asia, and no advertisers. As one executive put it, “we’re not 
entirely sure where “there” is now.” 
<p>To blast is to infect injuriously.
<p>Ethnic anxieties have escalated: Muslim, South Asian and Arab 
men were “tracked, interrogated and rounded up on 200 college 
campuses”.  A Muslim woman was subjected to a humiliating body search 
at O'Hare Airport in Chicago when she refused to remove her scarf.  
Visitors from specific countries will be fingerprinted. And we can spy 
on our neighbors and at the person sitting next to you at this 
conference through the TIPS program. Pro-Palestinian college faculty 
have been targeted in the U.S.
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, the second largest Federal 
Agency, institutionalizes ethnic anxieties.  It will have more armed 
federal agents than any other agency.  It limits openness and 
accountability, threatens the freedom of information act, and advances 
racial profiling.  It has the potential to turn whistleblowers into 
enemies of the state.  The budget allocations for Homeland Security 
demonstrate that racialization of anxiety can be translated into 
dollars: the largest budget area, more than 50 times that allocated for 
21st century technology, is designated for “SECURING AMERICA”S 
BORDERS.” 
<p>On the internet, anti-Osama, anti-Arab gaming sights have multiplied into the 
hundreds. The image of Osama Bin Laden is the most circulated digital skin on 
the internet for gamers, with George Bush second. These games express that which 
George Bush, whose endless claims that we have no quarrel with the peoples Afghanistan 
and Iraq, repress: they are the fanstasmatic projection of power over the unknowable, 
the invisible and the unfindable. They are called Bye Bye Bin Laden, The Kill 
Osama Game, Bend Over Bin Laden, Slap Osama, Capture Bin Laden,Where’s Osama Bin 
Hiding? Special Ops. These games displace the Revolution in Military Affairs. 
They elaborate the digitalization of warfare with the psychic manifestation of 
racialized, gendered and sexualized hatred. 
<p>These revenge fantasies are the psychotic underside of the national phantasmatic 
that pledges restraint and precision bombing. The user’s mouse and keyboard kill, 
explode and delete Arab men–a pathological, racist compulsion. 
<p>These interfaces racialize our computer keyboards as white, 
American, male killers for whom linear narrative eroticizes death. We 
are the machineries of war. Touch merges with the fantasy of the screen 
which is Arab, which is male, which is silent.  Our audio speakers 
engulf us with the blasts of explosions. 
<p>To blast is to produce a shockwave. To blast is hot air on steel to smelt something 
new. In the end, I am not sure what shapes our politics and critical art will 
assume in this slippery, chaotic, authoritarian world. I only know we need both. 
Echoing the narrative of Kandahar, indymedia journalists Jeremy Scahill and Jacquie 
Soohen are now in Baghdad, reporting the invisible story of Iraq through daily 
webcasts on <a href="http://www.iraqjournal.org" target="_new">iraqjournal.org</a>. 
We need their reports and their dissent. Perhaps, through digital art as a prosthesis 
of hope and shockwave of peace, we can relearn that if we are alive --and not 
dead - -we are all, indeed, limbs of one body.
