<p>HOW DID America get to this place? 
<P> It is the electorate in a democratic superpower that is ultimately responsible 
for the power wielded in its name. Citizenship demands focused attention. It requires 
staying awake, even for the boring parts. 
<P> We have opted for distraction instead. 
<P> In Amusing Ourselves to Death, education theorist Neil Postman notes how 19th 
century farmers and villagers turned out for hours-long debates by the likes of 
Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. We would rather spend the night at Home Depot 
buying lawn furniture. We scrutinize the ads for cell phone deals as if life or 
death hangs in the balance. We count our frequent-flier miles, buy our Powerball 
tickets, go to the spa. 
<P> Meanwhile, our leaders decide on war and peace, pollution controls, tax cuts 
and health care. 
<P> The facts are out there. Income disparity, housing costs, campaign spending, 
incarceration rates, substance abuse, depression and road rage -- all are on the 
increase, while voter turnout, school funding, air quality, affordable health 
care, retirement security and corporate accountability plummet. High school kids 
graduate unprepared to think with clarity or independence. 
<P> If this is the American dream, it might be time to wake up. 
<P> How did we get to this place? 
<P> Those of us who see our circumstances largely resulting from Republican policies 
find it easy to blame the Democrats in Congress for quiescence and timidity. Yet 
those who place the blame forget the essential logic of democracy: It&#39;s the 
people who decide the contours of government policy. Both parties may be forgiven 
part way for their failures because the people are sending mixed signals. One 
poll question shows lopsided support for a particular position. The next question, 
nearly identical in meaning to the first, elicits a different response. 
<P> That said, history does not stand still, and the Democratic leadership is 
in a time warp. Call it &quot;anti-Vietnam syndrome.&quot; The specter of 1972 
and the humiliating debacle of George McGovern has had Democrats by the throat 
for three decades. The confused, milquetoast muddle that their party has become 
allows the Republicans to intimidate the Democrats into silence and to embrace 
far-right extremists with impunity. 
<P> But someone should tell the liberal leadership that Ronald Reagan is gone, 
and the public has moved on. Much of it is fed up with religious fundamentalism, 
corporate greed and mindless bloodletting as the political weapon of choice from 
Rwanda to the Middle East to Lower Manhattan. As hard times loom in ordinary middle-income 
neighborhoods, Americans suspect the Bush people have no intention of providing 
answers for their problems. 
<P> We have, like Marley&#39;s ghost in Dickens&#39; A Christmas Carol, hauled 
those chains of over-consumption and over-stimulation for so long we&#39;ve forgotten 
what inspiration feels like. The words of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. are resurrected for memorial dinners, but they are a dead language 
in the year of Tyco and Enron, Dick Cheney and Martha Stewart. &quot;Ask not what 
your country can do for you&quot;? Who was he kidding? 
<P> Americans are distracted, and our opinions are full of contradiction, but 
there is a deep craving no leader seems to have noticed. We need the American 
dream to add up to something beyond the Target receipts and HDTV. We would gladly 
make sacrifices that allow us to believe we have something to contribute to a 
noble purpose. 
<P> Some genuine leaders with brains, guts and vision need to come forward and 
risk their political careers for something larger than themselves. They may well 
not win the battle in the first round. But they will reap grateful support from 
surprising quarters, and they will not be forgotten by history.
