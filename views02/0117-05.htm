"The womb is a dark and  dangerous place,a hazardous environment," wrote the late Joseph  Fletcher, professor of medical ethics at the University of Virginia  School of Medicine.<P>These words have  haunted me over the years and have  come back to me again in recent weeks,  with talk of the imminent prospect of  cloning a human being and using  embryonic stem cells to create specific  body parts to cure diseases.<P>As shocking  as these developments have been, there  is still another biological bombshell  waiting in the wings - and this one  provides the context for all the others  and changes forever our concept of  human life.<P>Researchers are working to create a  totally artificial womb. Several weeks  ago,a team of scientists from Cornell  University's Weill Medical College  announced that they had succeeded, for  the first time, in creating an artificial  womb lining. The scientific team,led by  Dr Hung Chiung Liu of the Centre for  Reproductive Medicine and Infertility,  stimulated cells to grow into uterine lining, using a cocktail of drugs and hormones. The goal of the research is to  help infertile couples by creating an  entire womb which could be transplanted into a woman.<P>Yosinori Kuwabara and his colleagues,  working in a small research laboratory  at Juntendou University in Tokyo,are  developing the first operational artificial womb - a clear plastic tank the size  of a bread basket, filled with amniotic  fluid stabilised at body temperature.For  the past several years, Kuwabara and  his team have kept goat foetuses alive  and growing for up to 10 days by connecting their umbilical cords to two  machines that serve as a placenta,  pumping in blood, oxygen and nutrients  and disposing of waste products. While  the plastic womb is still only a prototype, Kuwabara predicts that a fully  functioning artificial womb capable of  gestating a human foetus may be a reality in less than six years.Others are  more sceptical, but say we will probably  see the mass use of artificial wombs by  the time today's babies become parents.<P>Artificial wombs will most likely first  be used as intensive care units for foe-  tuses in cases where either the mother  is ill and can no longer carry the child  or where the foetus is ill and needs to be  removed from the mother's womb and  cared for where it can be easily monitored. We can already keep foetuses  alive in incubators during the last three  months of gestation. And researchers  routinely fertilise eggs and keep  embryos alive in vitro for the first three  to four days of their existence before  implanting them in a womb. Scientists  like Kuwabara are attempting to fill in  the time between the beginning and  end of the gestation process - the critical period where the foetus develops  most of its organs.  <P>Eventually, say many scientists working in the new field of foetal molecular  biology, being able to grow a foetus in a  totally artificial womb would make it  easier to make genetic corrections and  modifications - creating designer  babies. The artificial womb may even  become the preferred means of producing a child. Women could have their  eggs removed and men their sperm  taken in their teen years when they are  most viable and kept frozen until they  are ready to have a child. Mothers could  spare themselves the rigours and inconveniences of pregnancy, retain their youthful figures and bring the baby home when "done".  <P>Far fetched? Thousands of surrogate  mothers' wombs have already been used  to gestate someone else 's fertilised  embryos. The artificial womb seems the  next logical step in a process that has  increasingly removed reproduction  from traditional maternity and made of  it a laboratory process.  <P>Of course, many women, when asked,  say they would prefer to have the experience of being pregnant and having the  baby in their own womb. But their  expectations might represent the dying  sensibilities of the old order. In Aldous  Huxley's Brave New World, the "normal"  people were genetically designed,  cloned and gestated in artificial wombs - a biological assembly line process  churning out ideal genotypes. Only the  savages living in the remote reservations  still carried their own babies in their  bodies and breastfed them after birth.  The practice was considered disgusting  and something only animals did.  <P>In the Brave New World, erotic sexual activity is encouraged and  freely practised but completely  divorced from the process of  reproduction. Huxley wrote his  novel in 1932, before the contraceptive  pill had arrived. By the 1970s, however,  sex and reproduction had branched into  two separate realms, thanks, in large  part, to the pill. It is also interesting to  note that the pill made its debut at  about the same time that researchers  first began to use artificial insemination  on a wide scale. While the pill revolutionised sex, removing it from the  process of reproduction, artificial  insemination, then later in vitro fertilisation, egg donation, surrogacy and,  soon, cloning further separate the components of reproduction from the biological act of mating. The artificial  womb completes the process.  <P>Yet it raises troubling questions. We  know that a foetus responds to the  mother's heartbeat, as well as her emotions, moods and movements. A subtle  and sophisticated choreographic bond  exists between the two and plays a critical role in the development of the foetus. What kind of child will we produce  from a liquid medium inside a plastic  box? How will gestation in a chamber  affect the child 's motor functions and  emotional and cognitive development?  We know that young infants deprived of  human touch and bodily contact often  are unable to develop the full range of  human emotions and sometimes die  soon after birth or become violent,  sociopathic or withdrawn later in life.  <P>How will the elimination of pregnancy affect the concept of parental  responsibility? Will parents feel less  attached to their offspring? Will it  undermine the sense of generational  continuity that is so essential for reproducing and maintaining historical continuity and civilised life?  <P>How will the end of pregnancy affect  the way we think about gender and the  role of women? Some feminists argue  that it will finally mean liberation. Years  ago the feminist writer Shulamith Firestone wrote enthusiastically about the  prospect of an artificial womb: "Pregnancy is the temporary deformation of  the body of the individual for the sake  of the species.Moreover,childbirth  hurts and isn't good for you. At the very  least, development of an option should  make possible an honest examination of  the ancient value of motherhood."  <P>Other feminists view the artificial  womb as the final marginalisation of  women, robbing them of their primary  role as progenitor of the species. The  artificial womb, they argue, becomes  the quintessential expression of male  dominance, a way to create a mechanical substitute of the female womb.  Armed with the artificial womb, asexual  cloning technology and stem cells to  produce all the extra body parts they need, men could free themselves, once and for all, from their dependency on  women.  <P>The artificial womb represents the  completion of an even longer historic  process that began nearly 400 years ago  at the dawn of the scientific age. It was  Francis Bacon, the father of modern  science, who referred to nature as  "a common harlot". He urged future  generations to "tame, squeeze, mould"  and "shape" her so that "man could  become her master and the undisputed  sovereign of the physical world".  No doubt some will see the artificial  womb as the final triumph of modern  science. Others, the ultimate human  folly.  <P>Many people will likely say, why  worry? Surely the artificial womb is far  off on the horizon. Five years ago,we  thought the same thing about human  cloning and using stem cells to produce  body parts.
