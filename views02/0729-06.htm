<p><i>“Whence it becomes expedient for promoting the public happiness that those 
persons, whom nature hath endowed with genius and virtue, should be rendered by 
liberal education worthy to receive, and able to guard the sacred deposit of the 
rights and liberties of their fellow citizens... it is better that such be sought 
for and educated at the common expense of all...”</i> <br>
Thomas Jefferson - A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge 
<p><i>“I contemplate with sovereign reverence the act of the whole American people 
which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,‘ thus building a wall of 
separation between church and state.” </i><br>
Thomas Jefferson - Message to the Committee of the Danbury Baptist Association 
<p>The Sage of Monticello understood it clearly: there is a necessary relationship 
between personal liberty and the availability of a free public education for all, 
regardless of wealth or social class. Knowledge needs liberty in order to thrive, 
and a knowledgeable public is necessary to forestall endangerments to liberty. 
<p>The recent and regrettable decision by the United States Supreme Court, to 
uphold a decision supporting a private school voucher program in Cleveland, Ohio, 
is a two-tiered assault on liberty in the United States. The first tier is the 
obvious First Amendment violation of the establishment clause - so artfully described 
by Jefferson as a “wall of separation between church and state.” The second tier 
is the assault on the public schools. Private school voucher programs, used most 
often to publicly subsidize private and usually religious-based education, severely 
undermine the public school system in our republic. 
<p>Entropy in the public school system is widely believed to have begun with the 
property-tax revolts fashionable in the 1970’s. California, with its tradition 
of trend-setting in all matters cultural and political, led the way with Proposition 
13 in 1978. Because of public schools’ dependence on local taxation, especially 
when tied into property values, there have been increasingly disturbing inequalities 
in the system and added resistance to reform. The American Class Divide, long 
taboo to mention in public discourse, is reinforced and growing larger. The poor 
and lower-middle class children are denied the education they deserve because 
their schools do not easily foster achievement and success, and the better-off 
get the best funding, the best facilities, and the most opportunities for their 
future. Upward social mobility, especially achieved through quality education, 
was long a staple of the “American Dream”, and is now passing into near-mythical 
status. Lowered expectations and the hope of “just getting by” have become an 
acceptable replacement for this fading ideal. This is intolerable. 
<p>This defeatist mentality has long been the biggest obstacle to real reform: 
“Throwing money at the schools solves nothing”, “We vote for tax increases and 
levies, but nothing has worked”, or “It’s the bungling of administrators, teachers, 
and the government”, all offered as evidence that a solution must lie elsewhere, 
and a radical one at that. With such an enormous problem pressing for an innovative 
solution, it is no wonder that the Right, driven by the zeal and commitment to 
its agenda by dedicated activists, has stepped forward with the private school 
voucher idea. If the bureaucrats will not allow public school choice, voucher 
zealots argue, then action will be taken to put your tax dollars to work and provide 
a better education for our poorer children. The problem has been diagnosed correctly: 
our poorer citizens deserve the best education that tax dollars can obtain. The 
use of private school vouchers, however, is by far the most damaging of all the 
proposed solutions for our public school problems and to the accompanying liberties 
needed for a healthy body politic. 
<p>It is curious, but not too surprising, that these proponents of the voucher 
idea are usually slash-and-burn anti-government zealots in the Grover Norquist 
mold. These are the same people who feverishly call for the privatization of everything 
short of the armed forces. Of course, the justification offered is a long-cherished 
mantra of the Right: schools should only be the province of the local government, 
and completely at their mercy for funding. Conservatives have long been pining 
for the abolition of the Department of Education, and failing to succeed in that 
mission, have done quite well now with the voucher idea. Now, with the courtesy 
of a compliant and reckless Supreme Court, voucher programs have unprecedented 
momentum to acquire acceptance in the mainstream, and all but render constitutional 
arguments against them moot. 
<p>Voucher advocates know what they are doing. They are confident that the public 
is unwavering in its faith in the ideal that a quality education should be universally 
attainable. Americans generally agree that a formal education is a requirement 
for material success. The proponents of vouchers expect to achieve their goals 
by appealing to the public’s sense of fairness, and by playing to our tradition 
of equal opportunity for all. 
<p>It is questionable that their motives are entirely benevolent towards the disadvantaged. 
If they are, it is a fine and effective Trojan Horse for their real goal of complete 
separation of federal involvement in the public schools, if not a complete dismantling 
of them. 
<p>There is also a question of how effective the vouchers are in bringing equity 
to education. If constitutional arguments against vouchers have been rendered 
useless in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision, there is still the simple 
matter of practicality when vouchers are used. Just how much more in taxes will 
this cost the citizens in areas with voucher programs? Will they have the same 
options to vote against funding at the polls, by initiative? Can they vote down 
the voucher programs completely, achieving with democracy what the Supreme Court 
denied? With the issue of school vouchers, religion and politics do indeed make 
“strange bedfellows”. There has been an uneasy and very faint alliance of traditional 
civil libertarians from the Left, and the likes of none other than Pat Robertson 
on the far Right. Of course, the opposition to vouchers by most on the Christian 
Right avoids a constitutional tack, and goes straight for religious bigotry - 
they do not want their taxes to fund the education of poor Muslim students, or 
of any faith other than their own. This fear of theirs is especially pungent in 
America’s current climate regarding Muslims. 
<p>But most importantly, how does the possibility of more voucher programs being 
enacted bode for our personal liberties? Jefferson’s wall of separation works 
precisely because it guarantees the freedom of the conscience to worship or not 
worship as it sees fit. It guarantees that no American will be held in unequal 
regard because they do not worship the god of the majority. The wall works because 
it is good for the health of the government, good for the health of the people’s 
chosen church, and good for the health of the people who choose not to belong 
to a church at all. It is unfortunate that some proponents of vouchers choose 
to advocate them as a reaction to what they view as a hostile, secular public 
school system. Long lamenting the “removal of god” from our schools forty years 
ago, they stubbornly cling to their denial of the necessity of public education 
being secular, and therefore seek remedies with the utmost antagonism towards 
liberty. By undermining public schools, they still leave thousands of poor students 
in the lurch, their minds not reached, their dreams of success stillborn. The 
vicious cycle continues - the poorer a public school performs, the easier the 
justification to destroy it becomes. Defenders of public schools will be painted 
as apologists for bureaucrats, the teachers’ unions, and all manner of ungodliness. 
<p>The best way to defeat the increasing tyranny of private school voucher programs 
is to promote and strengthen public education. That is correct: throwing money 
at the problem. It is time to get past the usual objections, and acknowledge that 
top-heavy distribution of funds and horribly disproportionate local tax funding 
DO fail. None of those admissions of failure change the fact that not enough funding 
is provided. It works for the Pentagon. It can work for the schools. Similar enthusiasm 
for the funding and support of our schools is desperately needed. Justification 
for funding the military is based on maintaining the protection of our freedom. 
We must see our schools, too, as protectors of freedom. If our schools are seen 
any other way, what freedoms will there be left for our vaunted military to defend?</p>
