When elephants fight, it's the grass that
        suffers. Two nations like the United States and Iraq have
        unlimited potential for rendering irreversible damage to
        each other, to the environment and to the innocent people
        who get trampled underfoot in the stampede of war. <p>As
        a pacifist, I do not endorse violence. </p>
        
<p>But let's imagine for a moment that I went along with
        the idea that removing President Saddam Hussein from
        power in Iraq was a good idea, that this action would
        decrease the cycle of violence in the world, and that it
        were a decent and honorable thing to do. </p>
        <p>Imagine that we got rid of Saddam. Then what? </p>
        <p>There are still 23 million people living in Iraq, so
        long as we did not kill a significant number of them in
        dethroning the infamous leader of the Ba'ath party. Among
        the Iraqis left standing are young men and women who have
        grown up in a decidedly anti-American environment, who
        have been nutritionally deprived since conscious memory
        and who are living daily with the threat of future
        bombings which have dotted the landscape, virtually
        escaping Western media reports for the past eleven years.
        </p>
        <p>Are we naive to think that this same underdeveloped
        population that has endured hellishly hot summers, putrid
        water and abominable health conditions will now embrace
        American presence and show gratitude for our
        reinvigorated military effort against them? </p>
        <p>Imagine for a moment that we stopped finger-pointing
        and blaming Saddam for starving his people for the past
        eleven years. Imagine that we stopped blaming a
        recalcitrant Sanctions Committee and policy making team
        from the State Department. Imagine that we viewed the
        humanitarian crisis in Iraq simply as people in need. The
        unending, maddening seclusion maintained by the world
        community could then be addressed. </p>
        <p>What will we do for these civilian Iraqis with whom we
        have no argument, the unseen innocent survivors of an
        eleven-year siege? </p>
        
<p>A lasting peace plan in Iraq would have to begin by
        addressing the immediate needs of the average Iraqi
        people &#151; their access to potable water, their
        educational infrastructure, healthcare system, their
        agriculture and oil industries &#151; as well as their
        access to interstate and international travel.
        Restrictions on traveling to and from Iraq must be
        amended so that a dialogue may begin between Iraqis and
        other cultures throughout the world, starting with study
        abroad and student exchange programs.</p>
        
<p>In Iraq, doctors need vaccines, syringes with needles,
        X-ray film and blood bags. Teachers need books and
        pencils. Children need shoes and a happy childhood.
        Nursing mothers need proper nutrition to provide a
        healthy start for young lives. Iraqis need a wider array
        of food options and nutritional intake other than the
        lentils and rice available under the oil-for-food
        program.</p>
        
<p>Iraq needs an infusion of currency, a way to pay its
        citizens who desire to work, achieve and fulfill the
        demands of providing for their families. Immediately,
        Iraq needs a plan to rebuild its infrastructure &#151;
        the water and sewage treatment plants and electrical
        facilities so that air conditioning and ceiling fans
        function when the temperature is 140 degrees. </p>
        <p>We must accept responsibility for the life-altering
        consequences of our policies on people who should not
        have been targeted. </p>
        
<p>The world community, led by the United Nations, must
        apologize formally and publicly to the families who have
        lost loved ones as a result of the sanctions and
        no-fly-zone bombing campaigns in the North and south of
        Iraq. We must offer our sincerest condolences for our
        complicity in the crimes that killed more than half a
        million children. </p>
        <p>Unless we do this, the civilian Iraqis who are not the
        enemy will have every justification for taking every
        opportunity to avenge the egregious wrongs done against
        them. </p>
        <p>Gandhi tells a story about a wise man meditating by a
        river. A scorpion in a tree repeatedly falls into the
        water, and the wise man rescues him each time. And each
        time, the scorpion stings him. Another man sees this
        drama played out several times and approaches the wise
        man, asking why he continues to save the scorpion and
        risk being stung every time? &#147;It is his nature to
        sting,&#148; says the wise man. &#147;I am a human. It is
        my nature to save.&#148; </p>
        <p>Iraq needs no new war, no more bombs. They need simple
        human-to-human outreach. That is the right thing to do. </p>
