<p>The most evil man on earth, after Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, is Robert 
Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe. That, at least, is the view of most of the 
western world's press. 
<P>Yesterday Mugabe insisted that 2,900 white farmers will have to leave their 
land. He claims to be redistributing their property to landless peasants, but 
many of the farms he has seized have been handed instead to army officers and 
party loyalists. Twelve white farmers have been killed and many others beaten. 
He stole the elections in March through ballot-rigging and the intimidation of 
his political rivals. 
<P>His assault on white-owned farms has been cited by the Daily Telegraph as the 
principal reason for the current famine. Now, the paper maintains, he is using 
"food aid as a political weapon". As a candidate for the post of World's Third 
Most Evil Man, he appears to possess all the right credentials. 
<P>There is no doubt that Mugabe is a ruthless man, or that his policies are contributing 
to the further impoverishment of the Zimbabweans. But to suggest that his land 
seizures are largely responsible for the nation's hunger is fanciful. 
<P>Though the 4,500 white farmers there own two-thirds of of the best land, many 
of them grow not food but tobacco. Seventy per cent of the nation's maize - its 
primary staple crop - is grown by black peasant farmers hacking a living from 
the marginal lands they were left by the whites. 
<P>The seizure of the white farms is both brutal and illegal. But it is merely 
one small scene in the tragedy now playing all over the world. Every year, some 
tens of millions of peasant farmers are forced to leave their land, with devastating 
consequences for food security. 
<P>For them there are no tear-stained descriptions of a last visit to the graves 
of their children. If they are mentioned at all, they are dismissed by most of 
the press as the necessary casualties of development. 
<P>Ten years ago, I investigated the expropriations being funded and organized 
in Africa by another member of the Commonwealth. Canada had paid for the ploughing 
and planting with wheat of the Basotu Plains in Tanzania. 
<P>Wheat was eaten in that country only by the rich, but by planting that crop, 
rather than maize or beans or cassava, Canada could secure contracts for its chemical 
and machinery companies, which were world leaders in wheat technology. 
<P>The scheme required the dispossession of the 40,000 members of the Barabaig 
tribe. Those who tried to return to their lands were beaten by the project's workers, 
imprisoned and tortured with electric shocks. The women were gang-raped. 
<P>For the first time in a century, the Barabaig were malnourished. When I raised 
these issues with one of the people running the project, she told me: "I won't 
shed a tear for anybody if it means development." The rich world's press took 
much the same attitude: only the Guardian carried the story. 
<P>Now yet another member of the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom, is funding 
a much bigger scheme in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Some 20 million people 
will be dispossessed. Again this atrocity has been ignored by most of the media. 
<P>These are dark-skinned people being expelled by whites, rather than whites 
being expelled by black people. They are, as such, assuming their rightful place, 
as invisible obstacles to the rich world's projects. Mugabe is a monster because 
he has usurped the natural order. 
<P>Throughout the coverage of Zimbabwe there is an undercurrent of racism and 
of regret that Britain ever let Rhodesia go. Some of the articles in the Telegraph 
may as well have been headlined "The plucky men and women holding darkest Africa 
at bay". Readers are led to conclude that Ian Smith was right all along: the only 
people who know how to run Africa are the whites. 
<P>But, through the IMF, the World Bank and the bilateral aid programs, with their 
extraordinary conditions, the whites do run Africa, and a right hash they are 
making of it. 
<P>Over the past 10 years, according to the UN's latest human development report, 
the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa living on less than a dollar a day 
has risen from 242 million to 300 million. The more rigorously Africa's governments 
apply the policies demanded by the whites, the poorer their people become. 
<P>Just like Mugabe, the rich world has also been using "food aid as a political 
weapon". The United States has just succeeded in forcing Zimbabwe and Zambia, 
both suffering from the southern African famine, to accept GM maize as food relief. 
<P>Both nations had fiercely resisted GM crops, partly because they feared that 
the technology would grant multinational companies control over the foodchain, 
leaving their people still more vulnerable to hunger. But the US, seizing the 
opportunity for its biotech firms, told them that they must either accept this 
consignment or starve. 
<P>Malawi has also been obliged to take GM maize from the US, partly because of 
the loss of its own strategic grain reserve. In 1999, the IMF and the European 
Union instructed Malawi to privatize the reserve. 
<P>The private body was not capitalized, so it had to borrow from commercial banks 
to buy grain. Predictably enough, by 2001 it found that it couldn't service its 
debt. The IMF told it to sell most of the reserve. 
<P>The private body sold it all, and Malawi ran out of stored grain just as its 
crops failed. The IMF, having learnt nothing from this catastrophe, continues 
to prevent that country from helping its farmers, subsidizing food or stabilizing 
prices. 
<P>The same agency also forces weak nations to open their borders to subsidized 
food from abroad, destroying their own farming industries. Perhaps most importantly, 
it prevents state spending on land reform. 
<P>Land distribution is the key determinant of food security. Small farms are 
up to 10 times as productive as large ones, as they tend to be cultivated more 
intensively. Small farmers are more likely to supply local people with staple 
crops than western supermarkets with mangetout. 
<P>The governments of the rich world don't like land reform. It requires state 
intervention, which offends the god of free markets, and it hurts big farmers 
and the companies that supply them. Indeed, it was Britain's refusal either to 
permit or to fund an adequate reform program in Zimbabwe that created the political 
opportunities Mugabe has so ruthlessly exploited. The Lancaster House agreement 
gave the state to the black population but the nation to the whites. Mugabe manipulates 
the genuine frustrations of a dispossessed people. 
<P>The president of Zimbabwe is a very minor devil in the hellish politics of 
land and food. The sainted Nelson Mandela has arguably done just as much harm 
to the people of Africa, by surrendering his powers to the IMF as soon as he had 
wrested them from apartheid. 
<P>Let us condemn Mugabe's attacks upon Zimbabwe's whites by all means, but only 
if we are also prepared to condemn the far bloodier war that the rich world wages 
against the poor.
