One of the leading political figures embroiled in 
the Enron scandal is being handed a "Get Out of Jail 
Free" card, and he doesn't deserve it. That is Robert 
Rubin, President Clinton's former Treasury Secretary. 
	
	<p>Rubin seems to have everything he needs to be 
inoculated from the scandal's contagion: one of the 
most powerful and influential people on the planet, he 
has charmed not only bankers and political leaders of 
both parties, but the media and opinion-makers as well. 
In the press he was often portrayed as a primary 
architect of America's longest-running economic 
expansion, in the 1990s.

	<p>A cover of Time magazine in 1999 displayed 
Rubin, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, and Larry 
Summers (number two at Treasury, later replacing 
Rubin) as "The Committee to Save the World." But 
more recently he has been caught peddling his influence 
for the financial giant Citigroup, where he left public 
office to become a top executive.

	<p>As Enron's accounting irregularities were being 
discovered and its fortunes rapidly sinking, Bob Rubin 
placed a call on November 8 to Peter R. Fisher, current 
undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic finance. 
According to Treasury, Rubin wanted to know if the 
Bush administration was going to intervene with the big 
credit rating agencies, who were about to lower their 
rating of Enron's debt. Since Rubin's Citigroup was 
holding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
Enron's debt, it had quite a large stake in the outcome 
of any such decision.

	<p>Treasury told the press that Fisher said no, and 
Rubin agreed with the decision -- as if this were just an 
informational call to discuss the pros and cons of 
political intervention to protect the credit rating on 
Enron's bonds. But this should not be allowed to drop. 

<p>The public needs to know more about this phone 
call, and any others that Rubin may have made on 
Citigroup's behalf. Whether or not they are technically 
illegal, such actions are a blatant and corrupt abuse of 
one of the highest offices of our government.

	<p>For those who followed Rubin's role in the 
Asian economic crisis a few years ago, this comes as no 
surprise. If we look at what Treasury actually 
accomplished with a $120 billion loan package for the 
region, it was quite different than what Time magazine 
and the rest of the press were led to believe. They got 
the taxpayers of Indonesia, South Korea, and the other 
affected countries to guarantee the bad debt held by 
foreign corporations and banks.

<p>Rubin and Summers did nothing to help these 
countries when they needed reserves to keep their 
currencies from falling, and we now know that 
Treasury's actions actually helped cause the crisis and 
made it much worse. They were not "saving the world." 
They were saving Citibank and others from losses due 
to their bad loans -- just as Rubin tried to do when he 
called Treasury about Enron's debt.

<p>But these details of the Asian crisis did not get 
much press. That is why it is so important that the 
current investigations pursue the political corruption 
involved in the Enron scandal. Rubin is holding one of 
the two biggest smoking guns so far discovered.  (The 
other is held by the Bush administration: According to 
former Federal Energy Commission Chairman Curtis 
Hebert, Jr., Enron CEO Kenneth Lay told him he would 
support him as Chairman if he changed his views on 
utility deregulation. Hebert said he refused. He was 
subsequently replaced by Pat Wood III, a friend of Ken 
Lay and George W. Bush.)

<p>Of course most of the political casualties of an 
independent investigation would be in George W. 
Bush's camp.  After all, this is the Enron administration 
-- the list of officials with Enron ties is long and goes 
right to the top, including chief economic adviser Larry 
Lindsey (former Enron consultant); US Trade 
Representative Robert Zoellick (former Enron advisory 
board); chief political advisor Karl Rove (investor).

<p>But the Democrats have been unsure about 
whether to pursue the investigation into the political 
realm. Part of this timidity is a desire to avoid the 
appearance of partisan excess that, in the Clinton 
scandals, drew a backlash against the Republicans. But 
they are undoubtedly afraid that some of their own 
luminaries, Rubin chief among them, might end up on 
the wrong side of a subpoena. It would be a shame if 
these fears, and the media's reluctance to pursue these 
issues independently, kept the public from learning the 
truth about the political corruption involved in Enron's 
rise and decline.
