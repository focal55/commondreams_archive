<p>Just what is it about pleasure and danger that the power media don't 
understand? The answer is just about everything, as the brouhaha about Judith 
Levine's book on children and sexuality reveals.  Instead of discussing the 
very real perils Levine begs us to address in our culture, the Religious 
Right have succeeded in casting hers a "dangerous book." That will help us 
not one jot and we're very much in need.
<P>
Fury rained down on Levine's <I>Harmful to Minors: the Perils of Protecting 
Children From Sex</I> (Minnesota University Press, 2002) even before the book 
itself hit the shelves. 
<P>
Concerned Women for America and the Christian Right "Culture and Family 
Institute" went so far as to hold a forum in Washington to discuss whether 
the as-yet-unpublished book "encouraged pedophilia." It did, declared CFI's 
Robert Knight. It did, said Sandy Rios, president of the CWA. The Concerned 
Women sent out a press release claiming that Levine, a New York journalist 
with a long history of researching and writing about sexuality and gender, 
"advocates" molesting children. CWA's release called on the University of 
Minnesota's Regents to fire "those responsible" for the publication of this 
"evil tome." 
<P>
The Right's attack guaranteed the book attention, but mostly of the wrong 
sort. Dr. Laura railed on radio, Bill O'Reilly railed on TV. Too busy foaming 
at the mouth to pick up a copy of <I>Harmful to Minors</I>, O'Reilly said actual reading wasn't 
necessary, that you don't have to read all of <I>Mein Kampf</I> to get <I>its</I> 
gist. (O'Reilly didn't even make up his own hate-filled rhetoric. The quip comparing Levine to Hitler came from Dr. Laura crony Judith Reisner, <a 
href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/2254674.html target="_new">explains <I>Star-Tribune</I> columnist Kristin Tillotson</a>, who did her best 
to defend Levine's work on O'Reilly's Fox News slug-fest.)
<P>
So it continues. Thanks to a  handful of radical Religious Right outfits and their media cronies,  Levine's good book is now associated in the public mind with pedophilia and child abuse. Almost two months after the CWA event in Washington, <a href=http://slate.msn.com/ target="_new">Slate.com</a> 
ran a feature this week on <I>Harmful to Minors</I> beneath the banner, "What a 
new pedophilia book gets right and wrong."  
<P>
The trouble with all this isn't just that the "promoting abuse" allegations are false. (Since the initial bout of bashing, <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/389/2254674.html target="_new">some reporters have taken a deeper look</a>, and the charges quickly collapse.) The bigger problem is that 
ideological hysteria has helped the mass media miss yet another 
opportunity to discuss something serious and urgent. So much attention has gone to what 
Judith Levine <I>didn't</I> say that there's been precious little scrutiny of what 
she did.  
<P>
Levine's book is not dangerous, but there are dangers out there — dangers that 
ravage at least as many lives as the pedophiles the cultish Concerned Women 
want everyone to worry about. (Concerned Women, by the way, is dedicated to 
bringing <a href="http://www.cwfa.org/about/" target="_new">"biblical principles into public 
policy"</a>, a point those who quote them have been reluctant to tell their 
audiences.) 
<P>
Take the dread "pedophilia" chapter in <I>Harmful to Minors</I>.  It's short,
Levine looks at lots of data, among which is a Mayo Clinic study revealing that three-quarters of parents are afraid their children will be abducted by pedophiles. It's a more frequent worry than fretting over car accidents. This, despite the fact that a child's risk of dying in a car accident is 
25 to 75 times greater than his or her chances of being abducted and murdered by non-family members. Ninety-five percent of allegedly abducted children turn out to be "runaways or throwaways" from home, she reports, or kids 
snatched by one of their own parents in divorce or custody disputes.
<P>
In other words, we're worrying about the wrong things and quite possibly the 
wrong people: "Rather than indict our Monday night football buddies, rather 
than indict the family... we circle the wagons and project danger outward," 
writes Levine. "Screen out anyone who might be damaging to your child," the 
FBI's Kenneth Lanning is quoted as having advised the readers of <I>Life 
Magazine</I> in 1995. 
<P>
We've got some pretty vague ideas of what "damages" children, too. When 
she appeared on <a href="http://www.workingassetsradio.com" target="_new">Working Assets Radio last 
month</a>, Levine was clear: abuse exists, such as when one party does 
not consent to sex or when an adult in a position of authority uses his or 
her status to abuse a victim's trust. Children can explore their sexuality 
from babyhood on, she said, but pre-pubescent children shouldn't be out there 
having intercourse.
<P>
But beyond that, says Levine, we as a society are way too quick to see 
aggression, molestation and outright deviance in healthy expressions of 
youthful sexuality — and way too quick to shame, criminalize and 
patholologize healthy children for making all sorts of sexual explorations that are just part of their natural development.
 
<P>
Panicked by the dangers of "premature" or "perverse" or "unnatural" sex, our society 
almost entirely ignores the true risks of all that fear and shame.  
Think it doesn't hurt to be "too careful?" When it comes to "protecting" your 
kids from sex, it hurts.  "Protection" enforced in the way CWA would have it done 
denies young people information about AIDS and other 
sexually-transmitted diseases. (CWA's all for government-funded "abstinence" programs  which penalize educators and social workers if they so much as mention ways to have sex and also to be safe.) 
<P>
What makes sex dangerous is having it when you don't want it, or having it when 
you're too scared to ask questions, too afraid to demand condoms or too ignorant to demand touch that feels good. What makes sex dangerous is being too ashamed or too sad to know that you deserve a right to say <I>no</I>, or 
<I>not that way,</I> — or even, whole-heartedly, <I>yes</I>.  
<P>
The CWA has an axe to grind against Levine and all those who believe young people should get the information they need to make informed and safe choices when it comes to sex. Sadly, it's an axe that is grinding into our children and our society.  Levine just wants it to stop.
