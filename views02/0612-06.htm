<p>Hats off to Mrs Cheney on the recent publication of “America: A Patriotic 
Primer”, her ABC book dedicated to helping our children gain a better 
appreciation for American history and a clearer understanding of what it 
means to be a patriot.  I have not yet had occasion to see the primer, but 
suspect it is the sort of thing little Oliver (North, not Twist) must have 
had read to him before bed, and thus a valuable addition to our literature.  
Intense anticipation has prompted me to put together a patriotic primer of 
my own, if for no other reason than to appease my young offspring in the 
interim between the present time and the appearance of Mrs Cheney’s book at 
the local shop.  Aware that there may be others still waiting to get their 
hands on the real thing, I offer the interim version here.


<p>A:  AWOL.  Acronym for “American Way of Life”, closely linked to AMOK 
(American Milk of Kindness), the agency responsible for dropping peanut 
butter on Afghanistan in between bombs.

<p>B:  Bastard. “He’s a bastard, but he’s our bastard,” said Richard Nixon in 
reference to Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza.  The statement has come to be 
widely regarded as a guiding light in American foreign policy.

<p>C:  Consumer.  An amoral filter dedicated to converting world resources into 
refuse with maximum haste and minimum conscience.  An ideal citizen.

<p>D:  Defense.  We spend billions on it.  It still doesn’t hit curves or 
change-ups.

<p>E:  Enron.  Let’s talk about Evil instead.  Evil is a foreign commodity.  
Until fairly recently it flourished in empire form.  Today, evil is more 
commonly found in axes.  If there were truer support for the president’s war 
on terror, evil would disappear altogether.

<p>F:  Flag.  Our flag is sometimes exported to other countries, where it is a 
popular source of fuel.

<p>G:  Global Warming.  Two weeks ago, an empty hoax dreamed up by pessimistic 
eggheads.  This week, an official threat.  Fortunately, one we can’t do 
anything about.

<p>H:  Hitler.  Mathematical constant [h] loosely applied in political 
rhetoric.  Saddam > h.  General Aideed = h.   Noriega + Castro = h.  
Whatever.

<p>I:  Impeachment.  Unsuccessfully applied to the libidinous Clinton.  
Something they don’t even think about applying to Dubya for campaign and/or 
election irregularities, Enron, war profiteering, or other indiscretions of 
minor import to the nation.

<p>J:  Jesus Christ.  Dubya’s favorite philosopher.  The one who said:  “Love 
your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” one rationale among many 
in the gospel for capital punishment and the war in Afghanistan.

<p>K:  Kurd.  Member of a minority ethnic group to be left hanging as deemed 
expedient.  To be solemnly resurrected whenever an Iraq attack feels 
irresistable.

<p>L:  Literature.  Something a young person can generally live without.  
Consider Animal Farm, a story about state-induced conformity, corruption, 
lying, and perpetual war.  Once popular with young adults, this literary 
fable has become an irrelevant anachronism in our democracy.  If you 
absolutely must, you may request a synopsis of selected passages from the 
former book by filling out Form WG/7214 and mailing it to Vigilantes against 
Terrorist Tracts, c/o The Ministry of Truth, Washington, D.C.  Include a 
current photograph, recent set of fingerprints, and copy of your birth 
certificate, along with a notarized statement confirming that you have never 
harbored a warm sentiment towards Cuba.  In the likely event that your 
application is unsuccessful, you will nevertheless receive a complimentary 
copy of “Let the Eagle Soar – Campfire Fun with Commissar Ashcroft”.

<p>M:  Money.  What we’ve been making for 226 years, along with Progress, never 
mind the reactionary ingrates who note that our planet is somewhat frayed at 
the edges in consequence.

<p>N:  Nostradamus.  16th century quack.  Also, foremost authority on 
contemporary and future developments in 21st century America.

<p>O:  Oil.  Lubricant of choice on the slippery slope we tread.

<p>P:  Prevention.  Less entertaining and less lucrative than Cure.  We might 
give prevention a shot in 50 or 100 years if the war on terror is over.

<p>Q:  Quagmire.  Vietnam.  Afghanistan.  A term frequently construed as 
Victory.

<p>R:  Rogue State.  Any government demonstrably worse than our own.

<p>S:  Sivilization.  What we’re perpetually trying to sell to them what is 
sitting in darkness.

<p>T:  Two-Party System.  Ingenious method of ensuring that the bright ideas, 
real or imagined, of any given administration will come to no avail.

<p>U:  UN.  An international organization with more good intentions and high 
moral principles than my Aunt Martha, but less authority.

<p>V:  Violence.  A last resort that we unanimously deplore.  A first resort in 
times of uncertainty.  A blessing in times of greed.

<p>W:  Weapons.  The bread and butter of a group of ruthless profiteers 
(regularly referred to as “government” these days) passionately devoted to 
the pursuit of peace.

<p>X:  X-Ray.  Holiday camp in the Caribbean suspected of falling short of the 
Geneva Hotelier Conventions.

<p>Y:  Yellow.  Color of the ribbons we tie to our trees, and occasionally of 
the wartime American press.  Motto:  “All the news that’s fit to print, once 
it’s too late to matter.”

<p>Z:  Zap.  A fun word, the comic book way of handling insects or terrorists.  
According to my thesaurus: destroy, kill, slaughter, annihilate, murder, 
slay, assassinate, liquidate, erase.  Zapping has certainly worked wonders 
with the cockroach.



<p>And so, good night budding patriot, sleep tight.</p>
