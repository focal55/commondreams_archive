THE VILLAGERS El of Salado know why thousands of people in Southern 
Colombia have been fleeing in terror. A few months ago, El Salado endured an 
ordeal that could soon be re-enacted on a much larger scale elsewhere in the 
country: a massacre of civilians by right-wing paramilitary forces, with the 
acquiescence of the country's military.
<P>Peace talks between the government and leftist guerrillas are on the brink 
of collapse. A last-minute agreement Monday night -- just four hours before 12,000 troops backed by tanks were to roll into rebel territory -- provided a few 
more days to find a way out of the impasse, but prospects look dim.
<P>The rebels now have six days to come up with a timetable for a cease-fire, 
or the president's order that they leave the Switzerland-size zone they were 
allowed to control will be reinstated.
<P>If that happens, the rivers of blood that have flowed across Colombia will 
begin running faster and deeper with the blood of soldiers, rebels and 
innocent civilians.
<P>Colombian military forces are poised for a major escalation of the civil 
war. Now is precisely the moment for Washington to tell Colombia, in 
absolutely unequivocal terms, that paramilitary fighters must not be allowed 
to target civilian populations in the rebel enclave or anywhere else.
<P>In scores of towns throughout Colombia, the paramilitary's particular brand 
of horror has left scars that may never heal. On a Friday morning several 
months ago, a terrifying sight startled the people of El Salado: Hundreds of 
armed men marched into the center of town. One pulled out a list and started 
calling out names. In the next three days, those on the list would be tortured, beaten and stabbed.
<P>The armed men identified themselves as members of Colombia's paramilitary 
force, the so-called United Self Defense of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing, anti-
guerrilla vigilante force responsible for most, though not all, of the 
civilian deaths in the civil war. The AUC was started by ranchers and 
relatives of those killed by the country's leftist guerrillas. In El Salado, 
they accused the people on the list of helping left-wing guerrillas.
<P>A few miles away, the official Colombian army had set up roadblocks, 
keeping villagers from escaping and human-rights monitors from entering the 
town.
<P>In the first six months of 2001, the Colombian army reported nearly 100 
separate massacres that left 568 civilians dead. The guerrillas are guilty of 
many of the murders, but most are committed by the paramilitary AUC, often 
with the complicity of the country's army. And it is the AUC whose actions the 
United States can prevent by demanding that government forces refuse to permit 
death-squads to do their horrific work.
<P>The United States is the principal sponsor of Colombia's military. Colombia 
is the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid, after Israel and Egypt. The aid 
program is a controversial structure designed, in theory, to fight the drug 
trade.
<P>Because the many parties to Colombia's conflict, principally the leftist 
guerrillas, receive funding from the drug cartels, the United States can claim 
to fight drugs while, in fact, supporting the government's war against a 
guerrilla insurgency that has gone on for decades.
<P>With Black Hawk helicopters and American military advisers, the Colombian 
military is fighting two leftist armies: the Revolutionary armed forces of 
Colombia (FARC) and the smaller National Liberation Army or ELN. The fourth 
army in this complicated, many-sided war is the AUC.
<P>During the past three years, the government of President Andres Pastrana 
has engaged in a peace process with the guerrillas, granting FARC full control 
of a section of the country as an incentive to negotiate.
<P>If negotiations fail, as they very well may, the war in Colombia will 
undoubtedly get much worse. And there is every reason to believe the 
paramilitaries will punish the people of that region as accomplices of the 
guerrillas.
<P>The United States, which has branded the FARC as a terrorist organization, 
no longer needs to justify its support of the Colombian military as part of 
its war on drugs.
<P>In the new, post-Sept. 11 reality, the United States can act more bluntly. 
It will no doubt side firmly with Colombia's government in this war. But it 
must also stand with Colombia's people in protecting civilian lives.
