<p>It didn't take long. </p>
<p> That is, for Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, 
to run for cover. Days after her colleagues selected her to replace Dick "I'm 
Outta Here" Gephardt, Pelosi appeared on <i> Meet The Press</i>. Out of the box, 
Russert asked her about recent news reports on the increasing threat posed by 
a resurgent al Qaeda. Pelosi, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, 
confirmed the "threat is real" and added, "We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 
the President in the fight against terrorism." Is a new attack inevitable? Russert 
wondered. "That certainly is a possibility," she replied, and added, "We stand 
shoulder-to-shoulder with the president." </p>
<p> Clearly, she had inherited page one from Gephardt's playbook: regarding terrorism, 
handcuff yourself to Bush. Russert asked if Pelosi supported the policy of monitoring 
Iraqis who are in the United States. She did not answer directly, and Russert, 
in his way, kept pushing. She remarked she was not familiar with the details of 
this particular initiative, but asserted, "I stand with the president in rooting 
out terrorism." </p>
<p> Russert turned to the subject of war in Iraq. He noted that Pelosi, who had 
voted against authorizing Bush to launch a war against Iraq whenever he wants, 
had said in September, "I have not seen the intelligence to justify the action 
that the president is suggesting....What is the threat that [Saddam] poses to 
the United States?" Russert then queried her, "Do you think that the situation 
with Iraq is a distraction from the war on terrorism?" </p>
<p> Her reply: "I don't think its a distr--I mean, any decision--I don't question 
a decision of the president of the United States on his timing or on the priority 
he gives a threat." But wasn't that precisely what she had done in the remark 
Russert had quoted? And hadn't she taken issue with Bush's priorities by voting 
against the resolution? If she believed there was no justification for action 
against Saddam, then she would have to consider a war against Saddam as something 
of a distraction. On national television, she was undressing politically--and 
undermining her previous stand and the arguments of fellow Democrats who had joined 
with her in opposing the it's-up-to-Bush war legislation. </p>
<p> Pelosi caved further. Russert asked what she would do if Bush declared that 
Saddam was thwarting inspections and ordered military action without consulting 
the United Nations. "If our young people are called to duty, certainly we'll support 
the action of the president," Pelosi answered. "I hope that it does not come to 
that." She commented that she preferred the conflict be resolved "diplomatically 
rather than just showing our power by going in militarily." </p>
<p> Had she given Bush a go-to-war-free card by signaling that she and other Democrats 
would not stand in the way should Bush decide to attack Iraq without support from 
allies? Russert tightened the knot: "But if the president decides to go unilaterally 
or with the British and the Turks without UN approval, you would support the president?" 
</p>
<p> "Yes, I would support the president," Pelosi replied. At least, she dropped 
the bit about standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the guy. But where was the intellectual 
honesty? If, in her mind, the case has not been made that Saddam is a threat to 
the United States, why back a unilateral move? And why permit Bush--whose credibility 
she had previously challenged--to make the call on his own? Moments earlier, Pelosi 
had noted she fears a US strike against Iraq will have negative consequences for 
the war on terrorism. Consequently, in the event Bush does order such a war, it 
should be incumbent upon Pelosi, as someone whose job it is to protect Americans, 
to argue that a misguided action is under way. That, of course, would be a challenge, 
for extensive pro-war sentiment usually accompanies the initiation of military 
action. But with the position she has adopted, Pelosi doesn't have to fret in 
advance about being rolled. Instead, she is ready to salute. </p>
<p> Here is the Pelosi position: I'll argue with Bush over this life-and-death 
matter, but I won't criticize him if he makes a wrong decision that I believe 
imperils the nation, in fact, I'll endorse it. This is the sort of opposition 
that a president need not worry about.</p>
