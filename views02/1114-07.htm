<p>WASHINGTON — If the Homeland Security Act is not amended before passage, here 
is what will happen to you:</p>
<P> Every purchase you make with a credit card, every magazine subscription you 
buy and medical prescription you fill, every Web site you visit and e-mail you 
send or receive, every academic grade you receive, every bank deposit you make, 
every trip you book and every event you attend — all these transactions and communications 
will go into what the Defense Department describes as "a virtual, centralized 
grand database." </p>
<P> To this computerized dossier on your private life from commercial sources, 
add every piece of information that government has about you — passport application, 
driver's license and bridge toll records, judicial and divorce records, complaints 
from nosy neighbors to the F.B.I., your lifetime paper trail plus the latest hidden 
camera surveillance — and you have the supersnoop's dream: a "<org idsrc="NYSE" value="TOT.WS">Total</org> 
Information Awareness" about every U.S. citizen.</p>
<P> This is not some far-out Orwellian scenario. It is what will happen to your 
personal freedom in the next few weeks if John Poindexter gets the unprecedented 
power he seeks.</p>
<P> Remember Poindexter? Brilliant man, first in his class at the Naval Academy, 
later earned a doctorate in physics, rose to national security adviser under President 
Ronald Reagan. He had this brilliant idea of secretly selling missiles to Iran 
to pay ransom for hostages, and with the illicit proceeds to illegally support 
contras in Nicaragua. </p>
<P> A jury convicted Poindexter in 1990 on five felony counts of misleading Congress 
and making false statements, but an appeals court overturned the verdict because 
Congress had given him immunity for his testimony. He famously asserted, "The 
buck stops here," arguing that the White House staff, and not the president, was 
responsible for fateful decisions that might prove embarrassing. </p>
<P> This ring-knocking master of deceit is back again with a plan even more scandalous 
than Iran-contra. He heads the "Information Awareness Office" in the otherwise 
excellent Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which spawned the Internet 
and stealth aircraft technology. Poindexter is now realizing his 20-year dream: 
getting the "data-mining" power to snoop on every public and private act of every 
American.</p>
<P> Even the hastily passed U.S.A. Patriot Act, which widened the scope of the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and weakened 15 privacy laws, raised requirements 
for the government to report secret eavesdropping to Congress and the courts. 
But Poindexter's assault on individual privacy rides roughshod over such oversight. 
</p>
<P> He is determined to break down the wall between commercial snooping and secret 
government intrusion. The disgraced admiral dismisses such necessary differentiation 
as bureaucratic "stovepiping." And he has been given a $200 million budget to 
create computer dossiers on 300 million Americans.</p>
<P> When George W. Bush was running for president, he stood foursquare in defense 
of each person's medical, financial and communications privacy. But Poindexter, 
whose contempt for the restraints of oversight drew the Reagan administration 
into its most serious blunder, is still operating on the presumption that on such 
a sweeping theft of privacy rights, the buck ends with him and not with the president. 
</p>
<P> This time, however, he has been seizing power in the open. In the past week 
John Markoff of The Times, followed by Robert O'Harrow of The <org idsrc="NYSE" value="WPO">Washington 
Post</org>, have revealed the extent of Poindexter's operation, but editorialists 
have not grasped its undermining of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<P> Political awareness can overcome "Total Information Awareness," the combined 
force of commercial and government snooping. In a similar overreach, Attorney 
General Ashcroft tried his Terrorism Information and Prevention System (TIPS), 
but public outrage at the use of gossips and postal workers as snoops caused the 
House to shoot it down. The Senate should now do the same to this other exploitation 
of fear. </p>
<P> The Latin motto over Poindexter"s new Pentagon office reads "Scientia Est 
Potentia" — "knowledge is power." Exactly: the government's infinite knowledge 
about you is its power over you. "We're just as concerned as the next person with 
protecting privacy," this brilliant mind blandly assured The Post. A jury found 
he spoke falsely before.</p>
