<p>THE 102 minutes of horror between the crash of the first 767 into the North 
Tower and its ultimate collapse are the most documented moments in history. Some 
150 books are out there. Newspapers and magazines have produced special issues 
and are now turning out one-year-after editions and sections. Countless Web sites 
have sprung up. Steve Earle, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and others have recorded 
songs. Zillions of hours have been broadcast.
<P></P>
Since Sept. 11, I have seen the planes slam into the World Trade Center hundreds 
of times, tracked the flailing victims falling from the upper floors, watched 
the towers collapse from above, below, Brooklyn and beyond, witnessed the horror 
over and over again — and still hyperventilate or sob at the sights.
<P></P>
Just when I think I've seen every bit of video there could possibly be — as compiled 
in, say, HBO's <i>In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11 </i>(airing here Wednesday 
on Life and the Independent Film Channel) — more footage turns up. For example, 
CNN has already aired <i>America Remembers</i>, in which its news crews turned 
their cameras on themselves as they covered the event, while, on Sunday, CBC Newsworld 
will run <i>9/11 — Stories From The City </i>which shows New Yorkers shooting 
the evacuations of their homes and offices as the tragedy unfolded.
<P></P>
All this information. So little enlightenment. 
<P></P>
We're barely into the first anniversary wallow which peaks next Wednesday. There 
are concerts and commemorations, widows and orphans, survivors and heroes, faces 
and places of Sept. 11. Lots of whos and whats and whens and wheres — but precious 
few whys. Considering how everything was supposed to have changed as a result, 
it's instructive to examine what is missing from the 100-plus hours of planned 
coverage rather than what is scheduled. Here's what you won't see:
<P></P>
<li></li>
Ads: Major advertisers are balking at hawking their wares on Wednesday. Media 
buyers claim that commercials will seem crass and uncaring. Perhaps. But how about 
a tasteful minute of silence or sponsorship, with the money going to improving 
foreign news coverage on the U.S. networks? Instead, the loss of some $50 million 
in revenue will, in the long run, likely hurt news coverage. How does that help 
prevent another Sept. 11? 
<P></P>
<li></li>
An examination of civil liberties: Where did they go? Both in Canada and south 
of the border, far too many people were subjected to detention with no due process. 
When a Human Right Watch report recently came out on the subject, most media ignored 
it.
<P></P>
<li></li>
The hunt for Osama bin Laden: Uh, is it on? Are he and his henchmen dead or alive? 
Is Al Qaeda still wealthy and healthy as some reports suggest? Aside from a Newsworld 
documentary last night, there is virtually no mention of this subject on the airwaves. 
<P></P>
<li></li>
The prisoners: What's going on at Guantanamo Bay? Have the Al Qaeda captives slipped 
down the memory hole of history?
<P></P>
<li></li>
George W. Bush: Will any mainstream media outlet have the brass bits to examine 
the president's record before, after and around Sept. 11? Or will they continue 
to tiptoe around his administration's stunning ineptitude for fear of seeming 
unpatriotic? 
<P></P>
<li></li>
Ground Zero: Yes, there will be many memorials and remembrances. CNN has already 
aired and re-aired its <i>Sixteen Acres</i>, a look at the future of the site. 
But has anybody examined what poisons, toxins and carcinogens might have been 
in that dust and the smoke? Will thousands more New Yorkers die as a result? 
<P></P>
<li></li>
Fallen heroes: Did rescue workers die because the New York Fire Department had 
defective communications equipment? The New York Times recently reported on the 
subject. But few other media outlets have picked up on the issue, preferring instead 
the heart-wrenching tales of heroism and sacrifice. Why?
<P></P>
<li></li>
Afghanistan: So, how are the newly liberated people faring? Are the women there 
really better off? Has peace, law, order and good government been restored? Or 
have the people been bombed back to the Stone Age? Last week, <i>Newsweek</i> 
told of war crimes possibly committed under the aegis of U.S. troops but no other 
media have dwelt on the matter. Does nobody care?
<P></P>
Apparently not.
<P></P>
"The public has lost interest," CBS' Dan Rather told <i>TV Guide </i>(U.S.) last 
week. "They'd much rather hear about the Robert Blake murder case or what is happening 
on Wall Street. A feeling is creeping back in that if you lead (the newscast with 
international news), you die."
<P></P>
From what we won't see this week and next, it seems that if you lead anything 
but poignant, patriotic and superficial, you die.
<P></P>
Which, all things considered, does not bode well for the future.
