<p>LONDON -- EUROPEANS ARE beginning to experience the same sensations 
of impotence that Muslims long have. Whatever they think or say, it is tossed 
in the wastepaper basket by their American friends.
<P></P>
In the last week or so it has become evident that the Bush administration is hell-bent 
on implementing a new law, part of the recent anti-terrorist legislation, that 
sets out in no uncertain terms to undermine the new International Criminal Court, 
the pride and joy of a lot of countries but of the Europeans in particular, who 
see it as an effective tool for deterring would-be war criminals. 
<P></P>
The U.S. State Department has made it clear to all foreign countries that their 
military aid will be cut off unless — like Romania and Israel last week — they 
sign a pledge to protect Americans serving in their countries from the court's 
reach. Norway has told the Americans "no" and doubtless other Europeans if asked 
will say the same thing. But "nos" won't be enough perhaps.
<P></P>
The law says, as the New York Times reminded us, that authority is given to the 
president to free Americans in the court's custody by "any necessary and appropriate 
means." One presumes that means war.
<P></P>
Now the Europeans are beginning to understand what President George Bush meant 
when he said last autumn, "who is not with us is against us."
<P></P>
At the rate things are going, who knows whether there may be some briefing from 
some Pentagon "think paper" that will warn that Europeans are no longer to be 
regarded as allies. Saudi Arabia is still recovering from last week's shock of 
being labeled by a Pentagon working party as "the kernel of evil, the prime mover, 
the most dangerous opponent" of the U.S. in the Middle East. Defense secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld made it clear that he did not dissent from this piece of inside 
advice. 
<P></P>
At best, many Europeans consider what has happened in America the last couple 
of years as bizarre. First, acting as if it were some insecure newborn democracy, 
it chooses as a president the son of the second last president but one who has 
few qualifications other than his family name. The election itself was run in 
such a roughshod way that the ballot was suspect. 
<P></P>
Then the new president appoints a lot of senior officials — vice president, Defense 
secretary, national security adviser and many other high-level appointees, who 
have never known war, or shed blood, much less seen corpses rotting on the battlefield 
or villages destroyed with the remains of children's bodies splayed in a hundred 
directions. Many of them, like the president himself, consciously avoided the 
draft at the time of Vietnam. 
<P></P>
Yet it is they who are telling the military, against its better judgment, that 
it has to gear up for a new major war, against Iraq and who knows who else? Saudi 
Arabia? 
<P></P>
Then comes Sept. 11, followed by a commitment to "smoke out" Osama bin Laden. 
A war is begun against his refuge, Afghanistan, but bin Laden apparently escapes 
whilst at least as many innocent people are killed as lost their lives in the 
World Trade Center.
<P></P>
America — with its allies — is left trying to establish a central government in 
Afghanistan by cutting short-term deals with autocratic warlords, a precarious 
effort that Washington makes clear is a distraction from the prime (but failed) 
objective.
<P></P>
Shortly after the U.S. unilaterally raises its steel tariffs, hurting not just 
its closest trading partners but many of the Third World countries that finally 
are becoming what America always said it wanted — well on the way to becoming 
developed. Europe, careful not to do anything to polarize the deteriorating transatlantic 
relationship, forgoes its legal right to retaliate.
<P></P>
Before and after, and in between these major events, the administration takes 
pot shots at other causes the Europeans hold dear: the U.N. torture convention, 
the treaty on global warming, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the U.N. discrimination 
against women convention.
<P></P>
At the same time it effectually licenses Israel to retake the Palestinian West 
Bank, with Rumsfeld now making clear that American promises made as recently as 
early summer to push for a Palestinian state are now seriously in question.
<P></P>
No wonder that sober people in Europe are beginning to ask, where do they fit 
in the new U.S. political agenda? 
<P></P>
In a widely circulated essay, one observer, Robert Kagan writes that a U.S. show 
of power is inevitable considering that America has the weight of the world on 
its shoulders and is the only country powerful enough to change things for the 
better. 
<P></P>
But it is not simply a question of cracking the whip in the style of the old British 
Empire. The world doesn't work like that any more, not financially, socially and 
or even militarily. No country these days, however strong, can walk alone without 
courting defeat and disaster. 
<P></P>
If America's friends are pushed to be against it, this can only benefit America's 
real enemies. Is this what America really wants?
