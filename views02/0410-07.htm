For the past 17 months, we Israelis have been fighting an aimless war with the Palestinians.
<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>Despite our overwhelming military strength, we cannot beat their national aspirations out of them.</p>
<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>Despite their growingly suicidal determination, they cannot force their terms of independence on us.</p>
<p>There is no military solution to this conflict. The outline of the political solution is clear to everyone involved. Most settlements will have to be dismantled; Israel will have to return to some version of its 1967 borders; Jerusalem will have to be divided; the Palestinians will be granted no practical right of return. And yet we fight. Like blind, psychotic gladiators, we continue to circle each other, getting our bearings only from cries of pain and the taste of blood in our mouths.</p>
<p>We are losing more than our lives. Wars of attrition exact their most unbearable costs on the living. Militarily, intellectually and morally, we are eroding.</p>
<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>Militarily, the Israeli Defense Forces practically has relinquished its training schedule. One of the world's most efficient and celebrated armies is becoming fat and sluggish. The results are beginning to show.</p>
<p>To give just one recent example, a lone Palestinian sniper equipped with an ancient rifle killed eight soldiers a month ago and got away unharmed. This is a state of affairs we cannot afford. We live in a pretty volatile neighborhood. Iran is developing nuclear capabilities; Iraq is stockpiling on weapons of mass destruction; Libya and Yemen are unequivocally calling for Israel's destruction. We need an army, not a trigger-happy riot police.</p>
<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>Intellectually, we seem to have thrown our capacity for critical thinking into the wind. We are so busy digging into our foxholes, trying to block out the carnage around us, that we buy almost anything we are told.</p>
<p>Take the Karin A episode. For months, government and military officials have been claiming that the seizure of this shipload of heavy weaponry intended for the Palestinian Authority proves that the PA is a breeding ground for terrorists. Incredibly, no one has ever suggested the obvious counterargument: We are at war with the Palestinians. We have been bombing them with everything we have: F16s, Apache attack helicopters, Merkava 3 tanks. Wars are a two-sided affair. If you bomb someone, you get bombed back. It has nothing to do with terrorism.</p>
<p><span class="bullet">&#149;&nbsp;</span>Morally, we are going blind. A few weeks ago, a suicide attack occurred in Jerusalem while a soccer match was being broadcast on television. The program editors decided to split the screen in two, exhibiting the neat green turf side by side with the chaotic red human imbroglio.</p>
<p>Some time later, the IDF invaded several refugee camps in Gaza and the West Bank, looking for militants and munitions plants. The forces advanced from house to house by means of cutting holes in the adjacent walls rather than through the streets, which were deemed too dangerous.</p>
<p>At around the same time, a member of parliament scolded soldiers for crying at the funerals of their dead comrades, claiming that the practice was demoralizing.</p>
<p>What exactly have we become, if we can no longer separate soccer from dead bodies, walls from doorways? What kind of person doesn't cry at funerals? Would we want anything to do with that person?</p>
<p>''No one chooses to wage war or foments war for the sake of war,'' writes Aristotle. An aimless conflict cannot make sense. Anyone engaging in one becomes weak, stupid, opaque. It's time to declare victory, defeat or something. We can't take much more of this.</p>
