<p>Washington is in the midst of its biennial guessing game about what 
legislation will get the green light when the 108th Congress convenes 
next month. Many Committee chairpersons, of course, are just waiting to 
get their marching orders from the White House and their friends among 
the army of lobbyists (aka campaign contributors).

      <p>But at least one new Committee Chairman -- Senator Richard Shelby of 
        Alabama -- is making it very clear that he isn't waiting on instructions 
        from anyone. The votes had hardly been counted from the November 5 election 
        when Senator Shelby announced an agenda for his Banking Committee that 
        sent an early wintry chill through the ranks of big lobbying firms on 
        K Street in Washington. 
      <p>Shelby is talking about "safety and soundness" of financial 
institutions, a phrase that had been all but dropped from the vocabulary 
of most of the members of the House and Senate Banking Committees in the 
rush to meet the demands of the financial industry for more power and 
less regulation. And he is making it clear that federal regulators 
charged with safety and soundness responsibilities meet those 
responsibilities. It sounds like the regulators better be prepared to 
make lots of trips to the Senate next year.

<p>In interviews, the new Chairman has announced plans for hearings on 
whether Congress went too far in the passage of the financial 
modernization legislation (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) in 1999 and, in the 
process, jeopardized the safety and soundness of the banking system and 
the taxpayer-backed deposit insurance funds. The key component of the 
legislation was authority for banks, securities firms and insurance 
companies to merge and form giant financial conglomerates.

<p>Now the corporate scandals involved in the collapse of corporations like 
Enron and World Com are raising new questions about the conflicts of 
interest created by the legislation. Are banks making risky loans to 
corporations to assure that their securities affiliates can peddle 
lucrative investment banking services to the same corporation? Are there 
other tying arrangements involving loan and investment products that 
could jeopardize safety and soundness of insured banks? Shelby is giving 
every indication that he intends to explore these questions fully.

<p>His inquiry will add new heat to various investigations of lending and 
securities underwriting relationships already underway involving banks 
such as Citigroup, Suisse First Boston, and J. P. Morgan Chase.

<p>Senator Shelby was assigned to the Senate Banking Committee in the late 
1980s just as the savings and loan industry was collapsing, something 
that undoubtedly influences his concern over the safety and soundness of 
banks and the health of deposit insurance.

<p>"It all goes right back to the insurance funds," he said in an interview 
with the American Banker. "I believe that we have to look at setting 
banking policy from the context of making sure the funds are sound, so 
we will not visit the taxpayers again, like we did in the thrift debacle."

<p>Shelby opposes increasing the current $100,000 insurance limit on 
individual accounts and questions the "free ride" that banks are 
receiving through the 1995 suspension of premiums for deposit insurance 
for all but the most risk-prone banks.

<p>"I never have insurance on any building I have unless I pay the 
premium...I don't know what the premiums should be, but to just let a 
few people pay the bank insurance premium and give everybody 
insurance...that ought to be looked at," Shelby said when asked about 
deposit insurance by a reporter.

<p>Shelby is right. There is no legitimate rationale for the banks to 
escape paying for their own insurance when the taxpayers are on the hook 
for hundreds of billions of dollars for a bailout when the fund is 
depleted. As the Senator points out that is exactly what happened in 
1989 to the savings and loan insurance fund. Although largely overlooked 
at the time and seldom mentioned, the bank insurance fund also fell into 
the red in 1991, forcing Congress to adopt provisions for a $30 billion 
contingency fund for commercial banks which is still on the books.

      <p>But, for all of his concern about safety and soundness and the viability 
        of deposit insurance funds, very high on his agenda is privacy -- the 
        safeguarding of financial, medical and other personal data of individuals. 
      <p>During the consideration of the financial services legislation in 1999, 
he and Representative Ed Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts, fought 
hard to include a strong privacy provision that would have required 
consumers to have agreed in writing before any personal data could be 
released by a bank, credit card company or other financial institution. 
The consumer would have to "opt in" specifically to any data being sold 
or otherwise distributed to any third party under the Shelby-Markey 
provisions.

<p>After strong privacy language failed on the floor of the Senate, Shelby 
renewed the battle
when the House and Senate versions of the bill were being reconciled in 
a joint conference.
<p>Once again, the pro bank forces from both the Senate and House, pushed 
hard by a horde of financial lobbyists, blocked Shelby's efforts and 
adopted a privacy provision that provides no real privacy for the 
personal information of financial consumers.

<p>The weak privacy language was one of the big factors in Shelby casting 
one of only eight votes in the Senate against the adoption of the 
conference report for final passage of the financial services 
modernization bill. Opponents of financial privacy may find the going 
much tougher with Richard Shelby wearing the chairman's hat.

<p>None of this is to suggest that consumers will not have reasons to 
disagree with the Senator from Alabama on issues in coming months, for 
example items like bank redlining and the Community Reinvestment Act. 
But, Senator Shelby does come into the Chairmanship with a solid 
understanding of the Senate Banking Committee's responsibility for 
insisting on the safety and soundness of insured financial institutions, 
tough oversight of regulatory agencies and the protection of citizens' 
privacy. Those are some welcome and big steps forward.</p>
