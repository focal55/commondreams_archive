<p>Mohamed, a recently married Iraqi friend who works in the 
                    hotel where we stay in Baghdad, is expecting a child soon. 
                    Shortly before we left nearly three weeks ago, he approached 
                    some members of our seven-member peace delegation with troubling 
                    information about his wife&#146;s pregnancy. She will need 
                    a Cesarean section&#151;unfortunately, on his salary, Mohamed 
                    cannot afford the operation.<p>
                    Our team feels helpless listening to Mohamed&#146;s story 
                    amid the millions of others like it in Iraq. Even so, it isn&#146;t 
                    wise for us to get a reputation as problem-solvers. We do 
                    what we can, but working against the United Nations-imposed 
                    economic sanctions on Iraq can often be overwhelming.<p>

</table></font>As a woman visiting Iraq, I often have entrance into particular 
                    social situations unfamiliar to men, like holding hands or 
                    sitting next to mothers at the hospitals that tend their sick 
                    children. I grow particularly empathetic as I imagine myself 
                    in their shoes. I know the rage I feel here in the United 
                    States toward misguided economic policies meant to target 
                    Saddam Hussein but that directly affect the most vulnerable 
                    people in society: the women and children.<p>
                    In Iraq, life for women (especially mothers) was much better 
                    prior to the United Nations sanctions, imposed in August of 
                    1990. From 1975 to 1985, the Iraqi government invested large 
                    amounts of money in social programs, such as education and 
                    health care. A program to eradicate illiteracy among Iraqi 
                    women was exceedingly successful, and women have traditionally 
                    enjoyed freedoms not found in other contemporary Arab and 
                    Muslim countries.<p>
                    In an Oct. 1 New York Times article, Nicholas Kristof reported 
                    on the liberal attitudes toward women in Iraq. He wrote that 
                    women routinely serve in non-combat positions in the military. 
                    They pray, dine and swim together with men. Girls compete 
                    in sports as often as boys do.<p>
                    Compare these tremendous opportunities with those in neighboring 
                    countries such as Saudi Arabia, where repressive attitudes 
                    cloister women from public life into sometimes dangerous situations. 
                    In March, a group of Saudi girls was incinerated, having been 
                    denied exit from a burning building because they were not 
                    covered by a hijab, or head scarf. <p>
                    Although more openminded in its attitudes, Iraq has become 
                    decidedly more dangerous for women and children since the 
                    Gulf War due to the breakdown in medical care and especially 
                    in preventive medicine. Mohamed&#146;s wife knows this predicament 
                    all too well.<p>
                    In Basra, where much of the Gulf War fighting transpired, 
                    25 of the 26 obstetrics and gynecology students are women. 
                    During my first visit to Iraq in August 2001, however, I spoke 
                    with a physician at the Basra Pediatric Hospital who said 
                    that 90 percent of the women in Southern Iraq suffered from 
                    severe anemia, a health indicator with serious implications 
                    for women and children.<p>
                    Severely anemic nursing mothers cannot provide their babies 
                    adequate nutrition. Thus, even breastfeeding has become problematic 
                    during the past 12 years of economic sanctions.<p>
                    A UNICEF document from April of this year states that many 
                    Iraqi mothers have stopped breastfeeding and that only 17 
                    percent breastfeed during their baby&#146;s first four months. 
                    Under the Oil for Food Programme of 1995, a food basket handout 
                    for Iraqi families contains powdered formula that mothers 
                    increasingly use.<p>
                    This is problematic for many reasons, among them that the 
                    formula requires water for preparation. Nearly 62 percent 
                    of women said they report giving their babies water in the 
                    first month of life, and nearly 32 percent of the children 
                    drink unboiled water&#151;but the water in Iraq is severely 
                    contaminated. Many of the water purification, sewage treatment 
                    and electrical facilities were bombed during the Gulf War 
                    and remain largely unrepaired and are functioning at minimal 
                    capacity for a growing nation of 24 million.
<p> Last fall, Thomas Nagy, a Washington, D.C. professor, released a study called 
<a href="http://www.progressive.org/0801issue/nagy0901.html" target="_new"> <i>The 
Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the U.S. Intentionally Destroyed Iraq&#146;s 
Water Supply</i></a>. In this paper, he details information in government documents 
from 1991 about how the Gulf War strategy included destroying Iraq&#146;s civilian 
infrastructure, which violates Geneva Convention articles.
<p>
                    &#147;It notes,&#148; Nagy reported, &#147;that Iraq&#146;s 
                    rivers &#145;contain biological materials [and] pollutants 
                    and are laden with bacteria. Unless the water is purified 
                    with chlorine, epidemics of such diseases as cholera, hepatitis 
                    and typhoid could occur.&#146; Iraq will suffer increasing 
                    shortages of purified water because of the lack of required 
                    chemicals and desalination membranes. Incidences of disease, 
                    including possible epidemics, will become probable unless 
                    the population were careful to boil water.&#148;<p>
                    Currently, the killer of children in Iraq is gastroenteritis, 
                    caused by drinking contaminated water. One in eight children 
                    do not see their first birthdays. Imagine the helplessness 
                    of being a mother in Iraq, knowing what life was like before 
                    the Gulf War and before economic sanctions, wanting nothing 
                    more than to be a good mother and provide a healthy, nutritious, 
                    safe life for her children.<p>
                    In a meeting with the chief medical officer at the Basra Pediatric 
                    Hospital, I inquired about the status of preventive health 
                    care for women in Iraq. His response was that there is none. 
                    This is quite remarkable for Iraq, which until 1990 had eradicated 
                    all childhood illnesses and had the most comprehensive health 
                    care system in the Middle East.<p>
                    While abysmally lacking resources and training programs, the 
                    medical field is nowhere as bleak as the education climate 
                    in Iraq, especially for young girls. More than 35 percent 
                    of girls drop out before the end of primary school due to 
                    the high price of school supplies and the need to help supplement 
                    the family&#146;s income by going to work, likely begging.<p>
                    It seems we are condemning the women and children of Iraq 
                    to a fate similar to that of the 25 percent of American children 
                    who live in poverty, the 45 million people without health 
                    insurance and the 30,000 homeless in New York City alone.<p>
                    &#147;Conflict is the last thing people in Iraq need,&#148; 
                    UNICEF in Iraq reports. And when our group inquired about 
                    the potential effects of President Bush&#146;s growing military 
                    campaign, an official at the World Food Programme office in 
                    Baghdad sighed: &#147;The poorest people in Iraq will suffer 
                    the most.&#148; n
