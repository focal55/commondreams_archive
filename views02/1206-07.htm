<p>Fresh out of college I worked at a facility for developmentally disabled adults. There was one endearing woman, Adele, who was sixty and brain 
damaged. Adele had some things together and many others not - her gait, 
her speech, her ability to comprehend why she was at this facility 
instead of with her family were all significantly compromised. I asked 
the keeper of records what had happened to her because in some ways she 
seemed to be close to regular functioning but still far enough away to 
make her life confused and troubled. I was told that Adele's brain 
damage happened at birth. A nurse, insisting that a doctor be present 
for the delivery, pushed the head of the baby back up the birth canal 
until the doctor arrived. This nurse, either intimidated or brainwashed 
or both, defied the powerful pressure of inevitable birth and corrupted 
the event and the creation. I believe we are living a version of Adele's birth.

<p>The steady evolution of our country and technology is under arrest. The 
evolution of both belongs to us and is our birthright and yet we are 
suffering a terrible and invisible blockade. What deranged hands are 
holding back the birth process? They must be identified and relieved of 
their custody before they're allowed do anymore damage.

<p>I remember a college professor in the seventies telling us that World 
War III will erupt over a substance that ruins our environment and 
destroys our health. His prediction is taking shape. Our evolution has 
been commandeered and the birth process of new technologies is being 
postponed to damaging effects. Our hope for not only survival but for 
some kind of transcendent living is to surf the wave of natural givens. 
The sun, the wind, the tide, the heat of the earth's core, the flow of 
water can't be metered and sold. They, like our evolution, are 
birthrights. Technology that harnesses and interprets those forces can 
be made and sold and that will forge a new kind of economy that will be 
less neurotic and volatile. But like the nurse with her hand on the head of an emerging newborn, the people holding the reins of power want to 
preserve the neurotic and volatile. They are content to spend our money 
to make more weapons to kill more people to protect the flow of the 
thing that will pollute our lungs, skin and shores, which in turn 
increases the rage that targets us which supposedly then makes it 
necessary to allocate more money to make more weapons. That's the logic 
- that's the thinking of Adele's nurse and the illegitimate president.

<p>The actual, provable or suspected interference with the dissemination of
 new alternative energy needs to be addressed. National security and the 
common good are interwoven with wind, solar, geothermal, tides, biomass 
and whatever yet undiscovered forms of energy that "surf the waves of 
natural givens." The rebuilt Ground Zero should be powered by everything
but the fossil fuel that created it. It should literally be the point of
embarkation for the energy that will move us away from the black hole 
that is pulling us to its center.

<p>The explosive fuel that has secured criminal profits out of criminal 
agendas needs to be retired. Let it and the people on the land under 
which it bubbles, rest. They have a right to their political evolution 
without interference from the world's unhealthy and now pathological 
appetite for a substance they happen to have been born on top of.

<p>The pursuit and demand for alternative non-combustible energy is sane, 
moral, healthy, exciting, fun and essential. What is the national budget
for research into the development of alternative energy? What is the 
cost of a B1 bomber? What are B1 bombers protecting? Not us. They 
protect the profits of transnational corporations who put the people in 
office who will continue to funnel funds to the same irrational and 
deadly cycle of bombing to protect "national interests" or "national 
security" or "the American people" or "our freedom" or...and the numbing
litany goes on. We have to create a government that knows our security, 
interest and freedom rests in our claiming our evolution and either our 
representatives are part of that evolution or they must be asked to 
leave the birthing room.

<p>Representatives should be nominated and elected based on their vision 
for renewable, progressive and sustainable energy. Companies domestic 
and foreign that develop this new world order should earn our 
investment. Incentives and government subsidization should be insisted 
upon. The government should collaborate with our houses and cars to help
them become part of the new millennium rather than fossils of a toxic 
past. Our greatest natural resource is our genius for invention - our 
passion for initiative and ingenuity. The technological evolution is 
ours and if we allow the mad midwives that have occupied the process to 
push back the birth of a new era, the damage will be real and lasting.
