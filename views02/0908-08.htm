<p>"On Rosh Hashana all is written and revealed, and on Yom Kippur the course 
of every life is sealed.....How many pass on and how many thrive, who shall live 
and who shall die.....Repentence, prayer and acts of justice can avert an 'evil 
decree'." The question is "How can acts of justice avert this 'evil decree'?" 
</p>
<p>I have been pondering this question in light of our post 911 world and mindset. 
A mindset that demoralizes me, offends me and quite frankly terrifies me more 
than any single act of terrorism. I see a world that appears to be spinning out 
of control at an alarming rate of acceleration. A world, that from my vantage 
point, is headed on a collision course with its own irrational fears and resulting 
hatreds and violence. I do not believe in "evil decrees", nor do I believe that 
the future is ever written in stone. However I do know that when certain patterns 
of behavior continue, unexamined and unchanged, they do indeed lead to some very 
predictable consequences. The handwriting is quite clearly, "on the wall". This 
year the High Holy Days hold a particularly profound and auspicious significance 
for all of us both personally and globally. There really is no difference. We 
are all in this together. And I am wondering how "acts of justice" can change 
the sweeping tide of current events and change the course of our collective future...</p>
<p>When I think of the word "justice" a mental image appears. I see an ancient 
Greek goddess holding high the scales of balance in her hand. And I am reminded 
that balance is the essential nature of peace. Therefore, it seems to me that 
any act of justice should inevitably lead to peace. So, in light of this time 
of new beginnings; this time of creating the world anew, I would ask us all to 
seriously consider the following questions... Will acts of destructive retaliation 
lead to peace? Will negation of the humanity of those whom we fear lead to peace? 
Will the destruction of homes and villages lead to peace? Will demonizing "the 
other" lead to peace? Will denying people their dignity and civil liberties lead 
to peace? Will constant threats of violence lead to peace? Will the constant repetition 
of hollow platitudes lead to peace? Will oppression lead to peace? Does the dictum 
"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" express the sort of justice that leads 
to peace in the twenty first century? Do two wrongs ever make a right?</p>
<p>I believe that on this Rosh Hashana the sound of the shofar blast must be heard 
as an urgent wake up call. A call for us to challenge ourselves to become spiritual 
grown ups. To behave as though there really is a Creative Source of our Being 
and our world. And as reflections of this Source we really do have the capacity 
to act responsibly. We can use our minds and hearts creatively to reconsider and 
reenvision what justice truly means; in far greater and much deeper ways than 
we have ever done before. The conclusion I have come to is this... If it does 
not reflect our highest values and our deepest compassion, if it does not renew 
our spirit and bring hope to our hearts, if it does not make us proud of our own 
humanity, if it does not create peace, than it is not justice... If this sounds 
naive or overly idealistic in today's world, I invite you to consider the concluding 
words of an official statement that was drafted last year by several of our Nobel 
laureates. "We have reached a time in our history when idealism is the only realism". 
Shalom.</p>
