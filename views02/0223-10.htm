<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->"The Japanese economy must restructure, and must deal with her loans, her 
bad loans," President Bush told Asian reporters before his recent trip to 
Japan, South Korea and China, according to an article in the Feb. 18 New 
York Times.  The article did not mention that the U.S. borrows mainly from 
Japan.

<p>So are Japan’s loans to the U.S. bad?  If so, it stands to reason that U.S. 
borrowing from that nation could cause future problems.  Further, a Japanese 
economic restructuring, which the president wants, could have unclear 
effects on the U.S. economy.

<p>What’s one current purpose of U.S. debt held by Japanese lenders?  That 
would be to fund the U.S. trade deficit, the difference between what America 
buys and sells worldwide.

<p>A past purpose of Japanese lending was to fund public deficit spending on 
the U.S. military during the 1980s.  Public indebtedness rose sharply during 
the Reagan era.  This was done to protect Americans from the threat posed by 
the Soviet Union, which fell as the 1990s began.

<p>It has been said that history repeats itself, firstly as a tragedy and 
secondly as a farce.  Take President Bush’s current plans to increase 
funding for military/security spending to keep Americans safe from the “axis 
of evil”—Iran, Iraq and North Korea.  This will also help to push the 
federal budget from surplus into deficit.

<p>A Feb. 19 Knight Ridder article cast doubt on Japan’s ability to, in part, 
cope with its indebted banking sector.  Why?  Because “Japanese culture 
favors cozy political and personal ties over clear-eyed business decisions.” 
  Is American culture different?  Corporations that command the Bush 
administration would suggest otherwise.

<p>When it comes to reporting world affairs, the U.S. corporate news media 
deprives Americans of a critical context.  This can weaken the political 
consciousness of the general population.  Independent media is one cure for 
this condition.

<p>In the meantime, Japan has had a post-financial bubble economy, with slow/no 
growth, for roughly the past decade after years of strong growth.  One 
outcome has been fewer opportunities for profitable investments.  This 
helped to spur Japanese banks’ involvement in financial speculation, a 
factor in the nation’s current economic stagnation.

<p>Some have said that the U.S. economy may have entered a post-bubble crisis 
that began with the dot-com bust of technology stocks in spring 2000.  
Currently,  faked earnings and sour loans are emerging, working their way 
through the nation’s economy.  Like Japan, U.S. financial fragility has 
followed an economic expansion.

<p>So goes the cycle of financial peaks and valleys in rich nations such as 
Japan and the U.S.  In this respect, they are more alike than not, contrary 
to what passes for news and information in America’s “free press,” owned and 
operated by a handful of media corporations that are big and getting bigger.

<p>What goes around comes around.  So it is for capitalism, which has been a 
global system from its beginning.  The effects of expansion, speculation, 
recession and stagnation are far-reaching.

<p>We haven’t heard the last word on U.S. Japan relations.
