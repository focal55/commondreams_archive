<p>No one who has ever seriously believed in any cause finds it easy to criticize 
that same cause in public. The doubter's life can be hard, lonely and insecure. 
Conscience makes cowards of good people, around whom the habit of loyalty coils 
like a snake, difficult to shake off. In the battle between the heart and the 
head there is never an easy winner. 
<P>Tony Blair's belief in the importance of the US is a classic example of the 
perils of an undifferentiated loyalty. His own current problems need to be understood 
with that in mind. Some of his judgments over Iraq make sense, but are not necessarily 
excused by the fact that Blair is engaged in a struggle with realities which threaten 
one of his most enduring instincts. 
<P>Blair has long held the view that British domestic politics take place downstream 
from the US. He thinks Bill Clinton's election in 1992, and still more his re-election 
in 1996, were essential preconditions for Labour's own victory a few months later 
in 1997. He thought that the presence of a Democratic president in the White House 
made Labour appear to be cutting with the grain of history, not against it. 
<P>By the same yardstick, Blair saw George Bush's election in November 2000 as 
a more serious challenge to Labour than most people realize. It was one of the 
main reasons why he was so determined to be the first foreign visitor to Bush 
in early 2001. By getting to the president's shoulder at Camp David, Blair aimed 
to squash any pre-election attempt by William Hague to position the Conservatives 
as the party in touch with the new America. He is just as determined to prevent 
Iain Duncan Smith doing the same thing now. 
<P>Since 1997, Blair's belief in the importance of America has of course widened 
from domestic to international politics. He seems gradually to have formulated 
an approach to foreign policy which sees the US as the essential nation in the 
settlement of global and regional issues, and which identifies the Anglo-American 
relationship as the necessary catalyst ensuring American global engagement rather 
than isolationism. 
<P>Just how much he really believes in the mystique of the so-called "special 
relationship" is a hard call, especially given the more overwhelming evidence 
that Blair thinks of himself as a European. But he certainly acts the part of 
First Buddy with conviction. 
<P>No one who heard Blair speak at a White House dinner with Clinton in 1998 would 
be in much doubt where his heart as well as his head lay. That evening Blair quoted 
the biblical remarks of Harry Hopkins, Franklin Roosevelt's emissary to Churchill, 
at a wartime dinner in London: "Whither thou goest I will go, and whither thou 
lodgest I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Even 
to the end." 
<P>Nearly two years into the Bush administration's term, it is easy to forget 
that Blair sometimes had to struggle to secure US international engagement under 
Clinton too, and over committing US forces in Kosovo in particular. But any problems 
which Blair encountered with Clinton are as nothing beside those he has faced 
with his successor. As Frances Fitzgerald writes in a compelling essay in the 
current issue of the New York Review of Books: "The Bush administration has clearly 
broken with the internationalist premises that have been accepted by every other 
administration since World War Two, with the exception of Reagan's first." 
<P>As Fitzgerald points out, George Bush has rarely defined the goals of his administration's 
foreign policy. In public, he has talked mainly in vague, general terms. Depending 
on his audience, as in his adjoining article today, there is more or less mention 
of allies. But in most Bush speeches, the world is a place of threats against 
which US-defined solutions offer the greatest security. It was summed up in Bush's 
election campaign comment about threats to America: "We're not so sure who the 
they are, but we know they're there." 
<P>One result is that no one, including America's allies and perhaps including 
Bush himself, has a very clear idea of the kind of world that Bush would really 
like to see beyond US shores. Perhaps he will rectify that omission when he addresses 
the UN today in New York. But the other result is that Bush's subordinates, led 
by Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, have repeatedly set the agenda in a series 
of steps which amount to a wholesale repudiation of any theory based on collective 
action and alliances. 
<P>The extreme version of this approach is summed up by the number three man at 
the State Department, John Bolton, who once proclaimed: "There is no such thing 
as the UN. There is an international community that can be led by the only real 
power left in the world, and that is the US, when it suits our interests and when 
we can get others to go along." 
<P>A parallel approach has recently allowed the Pentagon, which has systematically 
opposed, abrogated and binned a series of international treaties, to abandon its 
long-standing "threat-based strategy" in favor of a "capabilities-based approach". 
According to Defense Secretary Rumsfeld this means that America needs to build 
up its defenses on land, sea, air and space "to defend our nation against the 
unknown". As Fitzgerald points out: "For the overall Defense budget, a 'capabilities-based 
approach' means simply that the Pentagon can ask for whatever it wants without 
having to justify its requests by the existence of even a potential enemy." 
<P>This is the reality which constantly subverts Blair's attempts to portray the 
Bush administration as a willing partner in the new moral order that the prime 
minister advocated at Brighton last year. He was at it again this week, claiming 
to the TUC that in today's world "internationalism is practical statesmanship". 
Everywhere but in Washington, it should be added. 
<P>It is hard not to feel some sympathy with Blair's predicament. He believes 
in the right things. He is trying to exert an influence that needs to be exerted 
in pursuit of a good strategy that would make the world a safer and better place. 
Yet for all his efforts he gets only grief, in Washington and at home. 
<P>He gets grief because there is a profound disjunction between what he wants 
to believe about this administration and what is in fact the case. But this administration 
has trashed the rules that Blair wants to play by. Rather than face that reality 
head on, he pretends, in public at least, that it does not exist. It's the mistake 
that other loyalists in other causes have made down the years. Like them, Blair 
faces a choice between heart and head, and between loyalty and truth. Like them, 
he risks allowing excess loyalty and insufficient clarity to make the wrong call.</p>
