<p>Dennis Kucinich is using his summer vacation to stir up working people across 
America. Come fall, he might just find that he is a serious contender for the 
Democratic nomination for president in 2004. 
<P>Indeed, while every Democrat who is even pondering a presidential run angled 
for a prime speaking slot at this week's Iowa AFL-CIO dinner - in hopes that the 
right message will kick-start their campaigns in that state's critical caucuses 
- Kucinich has been awarded the coveted keynoter spot. Later this month, he'll 
address the conventions of the United Steelworkers and Service Employees unions. 
<P>None of this means that the labor movement is ready to throw its considerable 
weight behind a still relatively obscure congressman from Cleveland. But it does 
suggest that Kucinich, whose passionate defense of workers' rights, civil liberties 
and sensible foreign policies recalls William Jennings Bryan more than it does 
most contemporary politicians, is certainly getting noticed. 
<P>Kucinich is in some senses an unlikely Democratic presidential prospect. He 
has cast votes against abortion rights protections, he has an intensely spiritual 
side and he is entirely unafraid of speaking his mind and standing his ground 
- even when it costs him politically. The former mayor of Cleveland was forced 
out of office at the dawn of the 1980s Reagan era when he refused to buckle under 
pressure from bankers and corporate power brokers who wanted to privatize the 
city's municipal utilities. 
<P>After Kucinich lost he was written off as a political ghost. But in the mid-1990s, 
he returned to haunt the corporate interests that had driven him from office more 
than a decade earlier. In 1994, Kucinich won a seat in the Ohio legislature as 
one of the few Democratic challengers to prevail in that Republican landslide 
year. Two years later, in 1996, he beat a Republican congressman and headed for 
Washington. 
<P>Unlike most politicians who suffer early in their careers, however, Kucinich 
did not come back cautious. Rather, the current chairman of the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus may well be the boldest member of the current Congress. 
<P>His courage was on display earlier this year when, in a speech to the Southern 
California chapter of Americans for Democratic Action, the congressman delivered 
the speech heard round the world. At a time when few members of Congress were 
willing to challenge a president with 90 percent approval ratings in the polls 
or that president's military adventuring abroad, Kucinich dared to demand that 
the United States stop and reflect on strategies that had led to the deaths of 
thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan, inflamed tensions in the Middle 
East, estranged the United States from European allies and undermined constitutional 
rights at home. 
<P>The talk of a Kucinich presidential run started after that speech, as dissenters 
from the Bush administration's military and economic policies hailed him as one 
of the few Democrats who was willing to challenge not just a popular president 
but the direction in which the nation was headed. 
<P>Whether Kucinich actually makes a run, and whether that run draws the support 
of powerful unions, remains a big "if." But there is no question that the congressman 
will continue to be the sort of outspoken dissenter from a dreary status quo that 
his party desperately needs. 
<P>"I believe the world is a profoundly creative place where we can turn war into 
peace, where we can turn famine into plenty, where we can turn fear into hope. 
But that does require us to speak up," says the Cleveland Democrat. "When we limit 
ourselves to the fears of the moment, we often miss opportunities to change the 
whole debate."</p> </p>
