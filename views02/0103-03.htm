I went to the FBI's website (<A HREF="http://www.fbi.gov" target="_new">www.fbi.gov</A>) looking for a particular piece of information and was surprised by what I discovered. 
<P>
The FBI produces an annual Uniform Crime Report that details illegal activities committed throughout the country. Included in the report is a section on "Law Enforcement Personnel." It's an extremely detailed accounting of police agencies across the country. </P>
<P>The Law Enforcement Personnel section provides information such as the number of police agencies in a particular state, the number of employees in those agencies and the ratio of law enforcement personnel to the population of a given region. </P>
<P>It compares the number of men and women employed, sworn personnel versus civilian, rural agencies versus urban, and it includes a county-by-county and city-by-city breakdown of every agency in every state. </P>
<P>Another section is titled "Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted." </P>
<P>The FBI apparently works with local law enforcement agencies to investigate capital murder cases in which an officer was killed. Or, if the bureau doesn't participate directly in the evidentiary process, it has an interest in compiling the information to produce a report at the end of each year about officers who were killed in the line of duty. </P>
<P>According to the FBI, 42 law enforcement officers were killed feloniously while on duty in 1999, and another 65 died as a result of accidents on the job. In 2000, 51 officers were murdered and 83 were killed in accidents. Numbers for 2001 were not yet available. </P>
<P>Oddly, given this wealth of detail, I couldn't find a single line about civilians who were killed by police officers. Wouldn't it be nice if the FBI took a fraction of the resources it dedicates to creating this annual cornucopia of demographic information and instead spent that time and energy investigating police shootings? </P>
<P>Recent analysis by The Denver Post has raised serious questions about the Denver Police Department's willingness and/or ability to deal with police officers who commit crimes or who make honest mistakes. </P>
<P>Two and a half years after the assault on Columbine High School, the parents of Daniel Rohrbough are still trying to learn the truth of what happened on the day they lost their son. A previous lawsuit has been turned away by the courts, but the Rohrboughs have filed anew on the belief that a Denver police officer may actually be the person who shot and killed Daniel. </P>
<P>In a perfect world, their claims against the Denver cops would be unnecessary and unbelievable. "Unnecessary" because the police already would have reviewed all of the forensic evidence and determined without a doubt and without prejudice that every person who was killed at Columbine died at the hands of Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold. </P>
<P>"Unbelievable" because we'd actually trust the results of that police investigation. </P>
<P>Unfortunately for all of us, the Rohrboughs' lawsuit is neither unnecessary nor unbelievable, and it points again to our desperate need for a system of automatic, independent investigations of allegations against police officers with full subpoena power. </P>
<P>Although I don't believe the federal government should routinely stick its nose into state matters, I think the FBI is probably our best hope for overseeing local law enforcement agencies. The best interests of everyone involved would be served. If the officer is not guilty of the charge against him, a full and open investigation would actually exonerate him as opposed to the sense many of us have now that the system somehow covered up for him. </P>
<P>The public would be served by having a mechanism for weeding out bad officers, and victim's families might finally learn the truth about what happened to their loved ones. </P>
<P>The power we grant to law enforcement officials is so great that we have to demand a high degree of accountability, and that must include a truly independent investigation of the facts whenever an officer is accused of abusing that power. </P>
