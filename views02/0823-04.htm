<p>I'm tracking a new phenomenon called "scandal fatigue." It sets in when the 
corporate crime rate gets too high and the numbers being bandied about become 
too boggling to get your mind around. 
<p> For instance, I was plenty angry when WorldCom announced that it had misstated 
its earnings by $3.7 billion. I couldn't really get a handle on what a figure 
like that meant -- but I knew it was a pantload. Then they looked through the 
books again and realized that, oops, the amount was actually $7 billion. Was I 
supposed to be twice as ticked off? Or were there just too many zeros to grasp? 
<p> The reason our eyes start to glaze over at a certain point is that we lack 
what T.S. Eliot called "an objective correlative" -- a way of relating to something 
as abstract and conceptual as a seven followed by nine zeros. 
<p> With that in mind, I've done a little research in an effort to offer up some 
perspective on the magnitude of these crimes. My hope is that when you see a number 
like $100 million -- the amount Jeff Skilling pocketed from Enron before abandoning 
the sinking ship -- expressed not in dollars but in terms we can all identify 
with, your outrage meter will be set to the proper scale. 
<p> Here goes. 
<p> The total amount of sweetheart insider loans doled out to John Rigas (Adelphia), 
Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom), Stephen Hilbert (Conseco), Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco) and 
Ken Lay (Enron) was $3.9 billion. 
<p> With $3.9 billion, you could: 
<p> -- Fund Habitat for Humanity to build 83,691 homes at a cost of $46,600 each 
for America's homeless. 
<p> -- Send 35,583 poor but deserving students to Harvard Business School. 
<p> -- Buy 390 million tickets to see "Austin Powers in Goldmember." Or one medium 
popcorn and soda. 
<p> -- Loan United Airlines the $1.8 billion it says it needs to avoid bankruptcy 
-- twice. Or you could just flush the money down the toilet. The results will 
be the same. 
<p> -- Foot the bill for you and the 195 members of your high school class you 
really liked to ride a Russian rocket into space. The downside is two of you will 
have to sit next to 'N Sync's Lance Bass. 
<p> -- Finance 39 equally priced sequels to Eddie Murphy's $100 million flop, 
"Pluto Nash." You could ... but please don't. 
<p> -- Buy every WorldCom shareholder a Xerox copier, some aspirin from Rite Aid, 
a year of long-distance service from Qwest, and a share of Enron stock (suitable 
for framing). 
<p> -- Fund the SEC's new, greatly increased, annual budget for five years. 
<p> Still having a little trouble with the figures? Well, consider this: According 
to Fortune magazine, the total amount of money raked in by corporate executives 
selling company stock even while their companies crashed and burned was roughly 
$66 billion. 
<p> With $66 billion, you could: 
<p> -- Fund the annual budget of the FBI, corporate crime-fighting included, for 
16 years. 
<p> -- Give 74 times what America currently gives in foreign aid to all of sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
<p> -- Cover the entire $25 billion America has spent fighting the war against 
terrorism in Afghanistan. And still have enough left over to give every Afghan 
more than two times their average yearly income. 
<p> -- Spend 132 million nights with Julia Roberts at the nightly rate she charged 
as the hooker in Pretty Woman. 
<p> -- Buy 3.3 billion copies of "Who Moved My Cheese?" But even if you read each 
and every one, you still couldn't explain why it's been a best seller for over 
two years. 
<p> -- Pay President Bush's $400,000 salary for 165,000 years. Although, if he's 
anything like his dad, you'll only be on the hook until 2004. 
<p> -- Pay the $1.08 million sales tax on Dennis Kozlowski's artwork and still 
have $65.99 billion left to buy every masterpiece in the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art's Impressionist collection at its assessed value. 
<p> I imagine your blood is really boiling now. But maybe still not enough to 
take action. Then try these numbers on for size: 
<p> The total loss in market value of WorldCom, Tyco, Qwest, Enron and Global 
Crossing was $427 billion. 
<p> With $427 billion, you could: 
<p> -- Fund the United Nations for the next 263 years and still have $164 billion 
left over for unforeseen famine relief and peacekeeping missions. 
<p> -- Get Argentina back on its feet by paying off its external debt three times 
over. 
<p> -- Give $356 to every man, woman and child on the planet living in poverty. 
<p> -- Build and deploy 2,702 comet-hunting Contour satellites. The cost to track 
them down is extra. 
<p> -- Buy 61 billion packs of cigarettes, now $7 each in New York City. Or you 
could transplant the lungs of 1.7 million patients -- at $250,000 each -- suffering 
from irreversible emphysema. 
<p> -- Order 34 billion prime cut filet mignons from Omaha Steaks. Baked potato 
not included. 
<p> -- Pay the combined salaries of every player in baseball for the next 237 
years. Although I don't know why you would. Despite your generosity, they'd still 
disappoint you and go on strike. </i></p>
