<p>YALE UNIVERSITY decided last month to offer supplemental financial aid to 
students who have lost their eligibility for funding from the federal 
government due to a drug conviction. This decision places Yale at the 
forefront of a national movement to combat the injustices of the war on drugs.
<P>Students convicted of any kind of drug offense, misdemeanor or felony, are 
denied federal financial aid under the Drug Free Student Aid provision of the 
1998 amendments to the Higher Education Act. Nearly 50,000 students have lost 
their aid since the law took effect. At least that many others have been able 
to attend college and graduate school, despite drug convictions, simply 
because they could afford to pay the tuition without financial aid.
<P>Yale is the third university, after Swarthmore and Hampshire colleges, to 
publicly acknowledge the injustice of this provision, which punishes 
individuals for their inability to pay for school, not for their drug offense. 
Not only does the drug provision of the Higher Education Act inflict extreme 
hardship on low-income students, like most drug laws, the provision unfairly 
targets poor students of color.
<P>As a Yale graduate, I am well aware that Yale's new policy may affect few 
applicants for financial aid to that University. Nevertheless, Yale's decision 
is significant because it is grounded in moral principles and common decency 
and thus broadcasts a message of national significance. Indeed, Yale's new 
policy harks back to a similar commitment made by the University at the height 
of the Vietnam War. Yale chose to supplement the financial aid of students who 
were conscientious objectors to that war, and as a result, emerged as a 
powerful, ethical voice across the country.
<P>The drug provision of the Higher Education Act does nothing to reduce 
problems associated with alcohol or drug use on college campuses and instead 
imposes barriers to education for individuals for whom access to education 
should be a top priority. While many students who attend Yale are regular drug 
users of both licit and illicit drugs, more than 63 percent of those students 
can afford to pay Yale's tuition of $30,000 a year and can also afford to use 
drugs in the privacy of their own dorm rooms. Perhaps the biggest drug-related 
problem facing colleges is that of alcohol -- a drug not covered by the Higher 
Education Act.
<P>The drug provision of the Higher Education Act is only one of several laws 
that Congress recently has passed that create obstacles for persons in 
recovery, such as the denial of housing and welfare benefits to individuals 
convicted of a drug offense.
<P>If one of the most prestigious universities in America is moved to fight 
the injustice of this drug provision on its campus, then Congress should feel 
obligated to revisit and reform the act on behalf of those individuals who 
lack access to Yale's endowment. Even the original author of the drug 
provision, U.S. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., has noted that the bill has had an 
impact that he never intended.
<P>Congress should heed the example set by Yale's new policy, which 
demonstrates the need for drug laws based on common sense, compassion and 
justice, rather than ignorance, fear, prejudice and punishment.
