PARIS -- For a magic moment, the citizens' movement was no longer on the defensive. 
From Seattle to Genoa, via Washington, Prague, Quebec, Nice and a dozen other 
destinations, the dispiriting decades of unbridled corporate greed and freewheeling 
financial markets seemed to be drawing to an ignominious close, smothered under 
their own sheer awfulness. Or if such a perception was mere wishful thinking and 
a bit premature, at least neoliberalism was under credible and forceful attack. 
<p>Negatively labeled "antiglobalization" by the media but known to its thousands 
of participants and millions of sympathizers as the movement for global justice, 
the nebula of protest and proposals was coalescing and gaining strength. The corporate 
and political elites could no longer meet in plush peace and confidential quiet 
to do their deals, and were obliged to retreat to fortresses whose defenses the 
demonstrators regularly stormed both physically and ideologically. The winds of 
history were blowing in a new and refreshing direction. </p>
<p>Then came September 11. Like the rest of the world, Europeans were shocked 
and horrified, especially by the sheer scale of the destruction and the potent 
symbolism of the targets, but in another and admittedly limited sense, we'd been 
there before. We'd had bombs in our metros, terrorist attacks on our railways 
and exploding cars in our streets, not to mention centuries of wars, invasions 
and occupations. </p>
<p>As the initial trauma wore off, we also tried to analyze what precisely lay 
behind the attacks and to ask political as well as moral questions. While everyone 
agreed that nothing could justify the terrorist attacks on the United States, 
some also recalled another September 11 when the American-sponsored coup d'&eacute;tat 
in Chile brought down the democratically elected Allende government, ushering 
in a fascist regime that murdered and "disappeared" thousands. American support 
for the<i> contras</i> in Nicaragua; the training of Latin American torturers 
in North America; the attacks against weak and defenseless countries like Panama, 
Grenada and Sudan; the bombing and blockading of Iraq leaving civilians dead and 
maimed but Saddam Hussein firmly in place--all these were remembered and discussed, 
as was the crucial US role in the endlessly destructive Israel-Palestine war. 
</p>
<p>While the prestigious French daily <i>Le Monde</i> headlined "We Are All Americans," 
others felt that this assertion very much depended on "which" Americans. Yes, 
without question, if it meant mourning for the victims and their families; no, 
if it meant unqualified support for the corporate, financial and government elites, 
and for business as usual. </p>
<p>Nor were we surprised when these same elites in Europe, our neoliberal corporate 
adversaries and their domestics, instantly seized upon the atrocities to advance 
their cause. By the morning of the 12th they had already sharpened their sticks. 
Using crude, faulty but sometimes effective logic in an attempt to intimidate 
and criminalize the citizens' movement, they declared, "You're antiglobalization, 
therefore you're anti-American, therefore you're on the side of the terrorists." 
For weeks, the media gleefully and unrelentingly framed their coverage and their 
questions in that light alone. </p>
<p>So we've had to explain incessantly why such arguments are not just wrong but 
pernicious, and we've refused them the pleasure of painting us into the villain's 
corner they had reserved for us. We reject as well the "antiglobalization" label 
and, in order to counter accusations of "anti-Americanism," stress our ties with 
our American friends in the global justice movement. We've also continued to mobilize, 
and on that score, it's gratifying to report that September 11 has had relatively 
little long-term impact. Although virtually unreported in the mainstream press 
and, alas, with zero effect on the negotiations themselves, the recent WTO ministerial 
meeting in Doha, Qatar, brought far more people into the streets than had gathered 
in Seattle. Decentralized demonstrations were organized in at least thirty countries, 
including forty locations in France and twenty-five in Germany. </p>
<p>The demonstrations in Laeken at the end of the Belgian EU presidency in December 
brought out tens of thousands, including a large number of trade unionists, with 
almost no violence (one or two shattered bank windows). On January 19, ATTAC-France 
(ATTAC is an acronym for the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions 
to Aid Citizens, whose program now reaches well beyond the push for the so-called 
Tobin Tax, the proposed small tax on international currency transactions) filled 
to overflowing the largest rock concert hall in Paris for the kickoff of the upcoming 
presidential and legislative election season. While we have no intention of becoming 
a party, we do promise to harass all the candidates unmercifully around our issues. 
Next month, ATTAC-Hungary will be launched, the fortieth country to join this 
international movement. The CGIL, Italy's largest and most progressive trade union, 
recently decided to become a "founding institutional member" of ATTAC-Italy. Kids 
all over Europe asked their parents to give them the airfare to Porto Alegre for 
Christmas so they could attend the historic international citizens' gathering 
there January 31-February 5. </p>
<p>We know that for Americans, the backlash of the terrorist attacks has been 
far more powerful and the aftermath more lingering. With flags flying on every 
corner, the obligatory rallying around President George W. Bush no matter what 
he decides, and a kind of suffocating and frequently phony patriotism dominating 
the debate, it's clear that the pressure is considerable. </p>
<p>Allow me still to argue that it's time to pull ourselves together, pull up 
our socks and pull together--take your pick of metaphors, but also take heart: 
September 11 is not the end of the world. History may even be handing us a radically 
new moment, one we did not choose but ours to seize. Our message is more relevant 
today than it was on the eve of September 11. </p>
<p>The emotions the atrocities awakened in all the rich Western countries caused 
me briefly to entertain the na&iuml;ve hope that their leadership might finally 
recognize the gravity of the situation and provide an appropriate response. I 
should have known better. Those who hold our futures in their hands are not serious. 
They see no farther than the noses of their bombers. Frightening though the prospect 
may seem, citizens must accept the risk of being serious in their place. </p>
<p>What does "being serious" mean? For starters, recognizing what our leadership 
refuses to admit: that terrorist nihilism is one response to poverty, despair 
and hopelessness. I don't mean to imply that redistribution of resources and aid 
programs, however well conceived, could have stopped bin Laden and his immediate 
followers. They care nothing about the poverty of their own compatriots, but they 
do know that terrorism thrives in the rich soil of exclusion and victimhood. </p>
<p>On September 10, half the world was already living, if one can call it that, 
on less than $2 a day, with a fifth surviving on half of that. Thirty thousand 
children were already dying needless deaths daily. Inequality is exploding both 
within and among nations, and perhaps contrary to the poor of the nineteenth century, 
today's poor know they are poor. The plausible fantasies of Western television 
constantly remind them of their own failure to capture the material rewards of 
modernity. </p>
<p>The only rational response to global problems is global solutions. "Foreign 
direct investment," the panacea of the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund, consists mostly of mergers and acquisitions that result in harmful economic 
concentration and job losses, and in any case such investment flows to only a 
dozen or so countries. The UN target of 0.7 percent of the wealthy countries' 
GNP for development aid is never going to be met, and we should stop pretending 
that it will be, because this particular pot of money is shrinking by some 5 percent 
a year. What resources do exist are unaccompanied by control over the local elites, 
who all too frequently use them for their own ends, a recipe for waste, corruption 
and inefficiency. What's needed is to ratchet up our efforts to the international 
level and launch a global Marshall Plan, financed by various international tax 
instruments (including but not confined to Tobin-type taxes) and made conditional 
on genuine civil society participation and rigorous auditing. Debt relief ought 
to be a precondition of a properly functioning world system; otherwise the debtors 
are competing on the "level playing field" the neoliberals never tire of extolling 
with lead in their sneakers. </p>
<p>The cash is out there. It can be found not only by taxing financial transactions 
but in tax havens where, as Bush himself has proven, it's possible to identify, 
target and close down accounts belonging to anyone the United States identifies 
as a terrorist--so why not the accounts of drug barons and traffickers in women, 
children, endangered species and armaments? Thanks to these same cozy locations 
in the Caribbean and other fiscal paradises, taxes on transnational corporations 
are undermined while taxes on labor and consumption contribute far more than their 
fair share. </p>
<p>"Free trade" as managed by the World Trade Organization and reinvigorated at 
the recent negotiations in Doha is largely the freedom of the fox in the henhouse. 
Despite the advance on generic drugs for pandemics like AIDS, tuberculosis and 
malaria, the South's needs are shelved and the transnationals continue to run 
the show according to their own preferred rules. </p>
<p>None of the profound changes we call for will, however, happen spontaneously, 
and our present elites certainly don't want them. Clearly the shock of September 
was not great enough to force them to change their minds and their behavior. </p>
<p>So, American friends, where does all this leave us? First of all, please bring 
the United States back. We need you, the world needs you. Although people on every 
continent are joining in this struggle, there are no guarantees we can win. Without 
a strong US movement, in the bastion of corporate and financial-market-driven 
globalization, we are in fact likely to fail. </p>
<p>I hope not to be misunderstood in saying that September 11 must not lead to 
an unhealthy inwardness and self-preoccupation but to tough-minded analysis followed 
by outward-looking action. The adversary hasn't changed since September 11. That 
adversary is still "Davos" and everything Davos stands for, whether meeting in 
the mountains or on the banks of the Hudson. <i>Homo davosiensis </i>wants all 
the resources, all the wealth, all the power and all the freedom to extend his 
ascendancy across time and space. This means that we too must be world-spanners 
and history-inventors, right now. As we say in French, <i>l'histoire ne repasse 
pas les plats</i>--"History doesn't offer second helpings"--so we'd better deal 
with what's on our plate now, which is world poverty, inequality, exploitation 
and hopelessness. How? </p>
<p>The great Chinese general Sun Tzu said 2,400 years ago, "Do not do what you 
would most like to do. Do what your adversary would least like you to do." In 
Porto Alegre, people from all over the world will be trying to determine what 
the adversary least wants and how to deliver it. In New York, we hope you will 
be supremely inconveniencing the Davos mob, denying it whatever it may want just 
now and in future (one thing it <i>does</i> want is for violence to spoil the 
proceedings and attract exclusive media attention, so watch out for <i>agents 
provocateurs</i>). </p>
<p>Personally, I have not been so hopeful in decades. The mood is changing. People 
no longer believe that the unjust world order is inevitable. To Margaret Thatcher's 
TINA--"There is no alternative"--they are replying that there are thousands of 
them. Now it's up to us all, especially to Americans, to prove that, as we say 
in ATTAC, "Another world is possible." And urgent. </p>
