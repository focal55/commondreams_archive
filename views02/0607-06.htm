<p> Israel's Six Day War, fought and won 35 years ago this week, 
marked a sea change in the life of the U.S. Jewish community. It was 
the fateful week when concerns about Israel and the Holocaust moved to 
the center of Jewish concerns in this country. Today, the effects of 
that change still sow seeds of insecurity in American Jewish life. This 
insecurity hampers U.S. efforts to serve as an even-handed broker in 
the Middle East.

         <p>It is easy to forget that before 1967 Jewish life here did not 
focus on Israel or the Holocaust. In the early 1960s, the concerns and 
values of Jews were virtually identical to those of their gentile 
neighbors.  Jews in the United States had gained a level of social 
acceptance and security never before achieved anywhere else in the 
Jewish Diaspora.

         <p>Then came the Six Day War of 1967. Millions of U.S. Jews felt, 
far more strongly than before, that Israel's fate symbolized their own 
fate and the fate of Jews all over the world. Virtually all Jews 
claimed that Israel's very existence was threatened (though some 
historians now question this claim).

         <p>It seemed only logical to conclude that Jews in the United 
States, and around the world, faced another Holocaust. Rather than 
celebrate its new-found security, American Jewry portrayed itself as an 
outpost of an eternally endangered and embattled people.

         <p>Today, most Jews still embrace the religious vision that has 
dominated U.S. Judaism since June 1967. The eminent historian of 
Judaism, Rabbi Jacob Neusner, calls it "the Judaism of Holocaust and 
Redemption." In this new form of Judaism, the prime religious 
commandment is to ensure Jewish survival by supporting Israel. With 
Israel the symbol of every Jew's fate, only the army of Israel, it 
seems, stands between survival and another Holocaust. This gives 
Israel's military actions a seemingly irrefutable ethical, and even 
spiritual, legitimacy.

         <p>Why did this intense concern for Israel, the Holocaust, and 
Jewish survival emerge so suddenly during the Six Day War?  Part of the 
answer lies in the pattern of U.S. Jewish history.  Jews here have 
always wanted to be somewhat distinctive without being too different. 
In every generation, they have most often expressed their distinctive 
identity in ways that fit the dominant patterns of U.S. society.

         <p>During the Six Day War, the Johnson administration supported 
Israel, seeing it as a crucial U.S. surrogate in the Middle East. 
Israel became a symbol of the Cold War battle against communism (though 
Israel's opponents actually had little sympathy for the Soviets.) To be 
pro-Israel was to be pro-American.

         <p>Cultural factors reinforced the political factors. In 1967, 
most Jews were liberals.  As mainstream liberals gradually embraced 
visions of racial equality and turned against the Vietnam war, many 
Jews sought (perhaps unconsciously) a way to define their identity that 
would be compatible with these trends.

         <p>Jews were learning to see themselves as white people in a 
nation whose people of color were demanding equal rights. They had to 
ask themselves whether they were, indeed, among the oppressors rather 
than the oppressed. Watching the horrors of Vietnam on television, they 
began to ask themselves whether they, as Americans, were among the 
oppressors of the world.

         <p>The Six Day War solved this problem. It allowed Jews to view 
themselves not as oppressors, but as members of an oppressed group. 
They could see their acts of self-assertion as morally valid, even when 
those acts were deadly military strikes. So Jews could gather in their 
synagogues to celebrate pride in Jewish power, which appeared to be 
both military and moral.

         <p>It was the pride of an oppressed people fighting back to 
prevent a new Holocaust. It was a pride that non-Jewish Americans could 
readily understand and applaud. In June 1967, U.S. Jews found a set of 
values distinctly their own, yet fully compatible with the values of 
their gentile friends and neighbors.

         <p>This synergy has served Israel's interests well. "The Judaism 
of Holocaust and Redemption" still permits many U.S. Jews, who have 
unprecedented personal safety, to imagine themselves as members of an 
oppressed and therefore insecure people. Out of that imagined 
insecurity, they support, or at least tolerate, hard-line Israeli 
policies that fuel Palestinian resistance and perpetuate the cycle of 
violence. Most non-Jewish Americans do the same, and so does their 
government.

         <p>The insecurity that grew out of the Six Day War led many Jews 
to demand a pro-Israel tilt in U.S. policy. But that tilt, so evident 
in the Bush administration and in Congress, makes it impossible for the 
United States to play a role of neutral peacemaker in the Middle East.

         <p>The "special relationship" between the United States and 
Israel now blocks the path to peace. If U.S. Jews need a peaceful and 
secure Israel in order to feel secure themselves, the attitudes born in 
June 1967, still block the path to their security, too.
