<p>All indications suggest that President Bush's anticipated peace plan for Palestinians 
and Israelis will only deepen the confusion regarding U.S. policy. Conflicting 
and contradictory statements from senior officials have left people throughout 
the region, and many in the United States, at a loss in trying to make out what 
the administration plans to do. 
<p>Now Bush is expected to recommend the creation of an "interim" Palestinian 
state as the key element in ending 20 months of carnage. 
<p>Apparently he will propose taking the status quo of nominal Palestinian rule 
in 40% of the West Bank and renaming it a state, although it would not have the 
rights and responsibilities of an actual state. This idea is not simply a nonstarter, 
it is nonsense. 
<p>Interim independence and partial sovereignty make as much sense politically 
as a woman being somewhat pregnant. Independence and sovereignty are either fully 
realized or meaningless. 
<p>Much the same may be said about the president's repeated calls for the Palestinian 
Authority to become democratic. While Palestinian reforms are clearly needed, 
it is absurd to speak of creating a democracy among noncitizens of a nonstate 
under a foreign military occupation and without meaningful sovereignty. 
<p>What is available under such conditions is, at best, the democracy of a high 
school student council, not that of a free people in a sovereign republic. Americans 
are heirs to a grand tradition of insight about the basic requirements of liberty 
and independent self-government--concepts that are casually betrayed by the facile 
blather about democracy without citizenship. 
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian extremists are busy ensuring that the conflict 
deteriorates to the point where no plan will stop the killing. 
<p>The intensity, viciousness and frequency of Palestinian suicide attacks against 
Israeli civilians have only increased as a result of Israel's recent rampages 
and the sacking of many West Bank cities. Israel's plan, announced Wednesday, 
to reoccupy Palestinian-ruled areas is not a change of policy; it's a continuation 
of Israeli behavior over the last five months. More of the same will meet with 
just as little success. 
<p>And Israel's new "security fence" is another chimera offered up by Israeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who continues to feed his people the illusion that 
the Palestinian uprising can be crushed and the occupation then continued in peace 
and security. 
<p>According to numerous reports, Sharon told a closed meeting of the U.S. Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee last week that there would be no peace deal for at 
least 10 years; that Israel was prepared for a 100-year struggle; that a Palestinian 
state was out of the question any time soon; and that the key to Israel's security 
was 1 million new Jewish immigrants. 
<p>The irony is that, in spite of the ascendancy of radicals on both sides, there 
is much for a genuinely committed White House to work with. 
<p>The Palestinians still have a secular leadership that is committed to establishing 
an independent state alongside Israel and that is not, as many falsely claim, 
dedicated to its destruction. A recent working paper presented to the Bush administration 
by senior Palestinian officials reiterates several far-reaching concessions made 
in the 2001 Taba talks regarding borders, Jerusalem, demilitarization and refugees. 
<p>The majority of Israelis are still in favor of a two-state solution, and serious 
progress would surely revive the dormant Israeli peace movement. 
<p>The plan forwarded by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and adopted by the Arab League 
provides an excellent basis for multi-party talks designed to create a permanent 
peace based on total Arab recognition of Israel, provided the occupation ends. 
<p>Most important, the Bush administration can proceed on the basis of its own 
stated positions--including support for an independent Palestinian state--which, 
if translated into proactive policies, would constitute a decisive intervention 
on behalf of peace. 
<p>What Bush needs to do is embrace his own vision, base U.S. policy on this vision 
and create a practical plan to bring it quickly into effect. 
<p>Despite the extremists, such a policy would enjoy powerful support from a majority 
of Americans, Israelis and Palestinians, as well as other Arabs. 
<p>It would offer the only real chance in the foreseeable future to end the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict. </p>
