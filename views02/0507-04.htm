<p>Over the last several months news reports of Bush
      Administration plans concerning the invasion of Iraq and the
      toppling of Saddam Hussein have appeared with relative frequency
      in the mainstream media. However, with very few exceptions those
      reports have emphasized either that these are contingency plans
      that have not been operationalized or the target date has been
      postponed until next year. In light of some recent circumstantial
      evidence and on-going signals from the White House, the later
      story especially, published in the New York Times, now seems
      like a case of Pentagon disinformation. The invasion of Iraq
      may be sooner than we are being led to believe by the propaganda
      machine.</p><p>Among the more telling signals not discussed
      yet in the mainstream media is the revelation that a number of
      MASH units are being called up to report for duty in July. These
      same units will be committed up to a 6 month period from the
      July date, that is, through the fall congressional elections.
      Added to this is the increasing reserve call-up of troops and
      the deployment of more warships to the region, including war
      games in the coming weeks with India. Further evidence of a push
      for a late summer/early fall invasion is the churning out of
      weapons, including the so-called &quot;low-yield&quot; nuclear
      bunker buster bomb.</p><p>With the White House still publicly committed
      to a &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq, is there any doubt that
      the Bush Administration is undeterred by the lack of support
      anywhere in the international community for a war against Iraq?
      Even the Blair government, with potential back-bench trouble,
      is nervous about a war with Iraq, especially because it was unable
      to generate any hard evidence against Saddam Hussein's complicity
      with Al-Qaeda networks. Given the continuing unilateralism of
      the Bush Administration, there is no reason to believe that the
      Pentagon hasn't been given a green light for its invasion plans.</p><p>Of course, the conflict in Israel/Palestine
      may be seen as a complicating factor. Certainly, Saudi Arabia,
      Egypt, and Jordan, all staunch US allies, have made very vocal
      their criticisms of the Sharon government and the need for a
      just settlement for the Palestinians. Nonetheless, several factors
      have further underscored the reluctance of the Bush Administration
      to push Israel into accepting the Saudi and Arab League peace
      proposal. Among those factors are the hard-line congressional
      supporters of Israel and the just completed pro-Sharon Joint
      Congressional Resolution. Also, Pentagon hawks see Israel as
      the key ally in the war of terror in the Middle East. Hence,
      it's just as likely that Sharon's visit to Washington will consider
      Israel's role in the invasion of Iraq since Israel's military
      power may be required to keep the Arab states occupied during
      a US full-scale attack on Iraq. In fact, a recently published
      story by an Israeli military analyst suggests that Sharon would
      attempt to capitalize on the war against Iraq to settle scores
      with other Arab states and even to begin a horrific &quot;transfer&quot;
      of Palestinians to Jordan.</P>

      <P>While Colin Powell and the State Department
      are making noises about an international summit on the Middle
      East, given the intransigence of the Sharon government, it's
      possible such a summit would provide a convenient forum to present
      dramatic new &quot;evidence&quot; of some violation by Saddam
      Hussein that would warrant a military response by the US. Given
      the recent involvement of the US in the attempted coup of the
      Chavez government in Venezuela, is it also not probable that
      a pretext to invade Iraq could be manufactured with the covert
      aid of US agents? This pretext would also provide a cover under
      the &quot;war against terrorism&quot; to circumvent the necessary
      Congressional debate and declaration of war. (Given the craven
      responses by the Congress in this area, it's hard to imagine
      there would be a majority to oppose such a war!)</p><p>The domestic fallout from a war against
      Iraq in the late summer/early fall would be to once more use
      the drumbeats of mindless militarism and punitive patriotism
      to dominate the political agenda and muffle any sound of dissent.
      Given the fact that some Democrats are beginning to criticize
      the Bush Administration on domestic policy, shifting the spotlight
      to waving the flag could effectively silence the Democrats and
      give the politically bankrupt Republicans the only forum through
      which they could effectively attempt to marginalize the electoral
      opposition. Of course, such a war could also potentially criminalize
      dissidents and a fledgling peace movement. Certainly, the Patriot
      Act has put in place all the repressive instruments for punishing
      anyone who gives aid and comfort to suspected terrorists.</p><p>While no one can predict any scenario
      with absolute certainty, there should be some clear understanding
      of why this Administration is hell-bent on a war with Iraq. Beyond
      the transfer of massive amounts of tax monies to the wealthy,
      the only real substantive imperative pushing policy for the Bush
      Administration is expanding the military and elaborating further
      the role of US hegemony throughout those areas of the world where
      oil is a fundamental resource. With so many members of the Bush
      White House bathed in the politics of oil (George W., Cheney,
      Rice, etc.), there is certainly an economic interest in taking
      out Saddam Hussein and putting in power a more pliant regime,
      ala Afghanistan. Also, given the conflicts of interest inside
      this Administration with the military-industrial complex (e.g.
      the Rumsfeld-Carlucci-Carlyle connection), there is an overwhelming
      push for deploying more and more weapons and troops around the
      world.</p>
<p>Of course, there should be no illusions
      that an invasion of Iraq would be an easy &quot;victory.&quot;
      One Pentagon study pointed to an &quot;acceptable&quot; death
      rate of 20,000-30,000 US soldiers. The arrogance of such chilling
      scenarios is further compounded by the lack of estimates of the
      number of &quot;acceptable&quot; Iraqi deaths. Given that this
      and previous Administrations have been willing to sanction the
      deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians by the withholding
      of vital medicines and materials, what number of actual deaths
      by missiles, bombs, and even potentially &quot;low-yield&quot;
      nuclear weapons would the Bush Administration tolerate? What
      level of disruption in the Middle East and potential blowback
      would be tolerable? Given the near-religious zeal of Pentagon
      hawks and evangelical fervor by Bush himself in fulfilling his
      destiny to rid the world of one of the linchpins the &quot;axis
      of evil,&quot; it's not difficult to imagine the moral blindness
      and near insanity of such policy-makers in their pursuit of war
      against Iraq.</p>
<p>The final question remains whether the
      citizens of the United States would tolerate such a maniacal
      war in their name. Certainly, the passions of the Middle East
      will be inflamed. No doubt what's left of the left in Europe
      will be in turmoil over an invasion of Iraq. How quickly and
      effectively an opposition will mobilize in the US will, to some
      extent, determine how homicidal the Bush Administration will
      be in its warmaking. Unfortunately, unless there is some totally
      unforeseen circumstances, there will be an invasion of Iraq sooner
      than later. And the sooner we plan to try to stop the war, or,
      at least, deter the worst ravages of such a war, the better for
      all concerned.</P>
