<p>American President George Bush has been demanding a "regime change" in "evil" 
Iraq, which he plans to invade. Saddam Hussein's possible reply, from Baghdad: 
<p>"My fellow Iraqis, it's time for a 'regime change' in the United States. President 
George W. Bush must go! 
<p>"Bush is a danger to Americans, and to the whole globe. America has become 
a 'rogue state' that threatens world peace and stability. Oh, my brothers, America 
is the nexus of evil! 
<p>"I have just ordered our intelligence services to help Americans overthrow 
Bush and his evil clique. We are giving military training and cash to the Hells 
Angels, Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and the Michigan Militia. I've ordered 
our fearless agents to kidnap Bush and bring him to Baghdad. If he resists, they 
are authorized to shoot - in 'self-defense.' 
<p>"Defectors from America report the U.S. is the grandfather of weapons of mass 
destruction: over 8,000 nuclear weapons, 31,200 tons of chemical weapons, and 
enough biological warfare agents such as anthrax, botulism, plague, Q-fever, and 
rap music to wipe out the globe twice. The U.S. is the only nation to actually 
have used atomic weapons, killing 240,000 civilians, and it is thinking about 
using them again. 
<p>"Israel, which keeps threatening nuclear attacks on us and our Iranian brothers, 
developed its secret nuclear and biowarfare programs with covert American aid. 
So did Britain, France and India. America is a major proliferator of nuclear technology. 
Back in the 1980s, when we were still America's ally, the U.S. supplied us with 
the very chemical weapons and germ warfare stocks it howls about today. 
<p>"Speaking of biowarfare, we all know how in 1991 the U.S. destroyed our dams, 
reservoirs, water pumping stations, filtration plants and sewage systems in the 
Mother of all Battles. After the war, the U.S. refused to allow us to import materials 
to repair our destroyed sanitary systems - even banning chlorine to purify our 
water. The ensuing epidemics killed a million of our children. 
<p>"The U.S. refuses to allow inspection of its nuclear, chemical, or biological 
warfare arsenals, or to destroy the nuclear warheads it now possesses. Without 
inspection and destruction of America's weapons of mass destruction, the world 
cannot be safe. Who knows, the U.S. might strike at any nation that displeases 
it! 
<p>"Just last week, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell warned Washington 'reserves 
the right' to overthrow all regimes it considers a danger. The U.S. is developing 
new 'mini-nukes' called 'Arab busters' for use against Third World nations. Who's 
next? 
<p>"As for terrorism, we suspect the United States had links to Osama bin Laden 
and his terrorists. After all, didn't the U.S. finance most of the militant Islamic 
groups? The U.S. has sponsored terrorist groups here in Iraq and in Iran, Libya, 
Cuba, El Salvador, Congo, Nicaragua, Angola, Sudan and Indonesia. The U.S. tried 
to assassinate Egypt's president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Iran's Islamic leadership, 
that crazy Khadafy in Libya, Gen. Adid in Somalia and, last, but not least, my 
humble self. Our prisons are full of U.S.-sponsored terrorists who sought to overthrow 
our glorious revolutionary regime and murder its heroic leaders. 
<p>"Now, a crazy cabal of petro-imperialists, Israeli agents of influence, fanatical 
Christian fundamentalists, Pentagon warmongers and Bush's pit bull poodle, Tony 
Blair, are plotting to invade beautiful Iraq. Then they plan to take their anti-Muslim 
crusade to Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Lebanon - and any other nations that refuse 
to kiss America's feet. Bush's Texas imperialists are determined to turn the world 
into a U.S. version of the British Empire. 
<p>"The people in the Pentagon pulling Bush's strings know our beloved Iraq has 
the Mideast's second largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia - perhaps the biggest, 
only Allah knows. Oil will soon be in very short supply worldwide. Even George 
Bush Jr., of Texas baseball, can understand this. America wants our oil. Watch 
out, Canada - your water may be next. 
<p>"I'm also deeply concerned about the welfare of America's suffering people. 
Their stock markets, accountant firms, brokerage houses and investment banks were 
run by super-crooks who make Ali Baba's 40 thieves look like simple melon merchants. 
Some of Bush's pals defrauded America's workers of their life savings, stole their 
pensions, and may yet cause a world financial crisis. In Iraq, such criminals 
would be shot and their families billed for the bullets. 
<p><B>'The Mother of all Lies'</B> 
<p>"Now, after wrecking America's economy, the war party in Washington is whipping 
up hysteria by fabricating tales claiming we intend to attack America with all 
sorts of nefarious weapons. This is the Mother of all Lies. We were proctologically 
inspected for seven years by an army of UN 'experts,' many of whom turned out 
to be spies. All - well, most, anyway - of our chemicals and germs supplied by 
the U.S. and Britain are either destroyed or have become inert. 
<p>"President Bush is up to his ears in business scandals. November elections 
are approaching. Remember that naughty girl, Monica Lewinsky, who fired Bill Clinton's 
Scud missile? Clinton diverted attention by bombing us. The Bush White House is 
trying the same old trick, but on a grand scale. 
<p>"My heroic, democratic and peace-loving Iraqi brothers - it's time for a 'regime 
change' in Washington!" </p>
