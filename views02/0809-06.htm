<p> Once again the Congressional toadies for the auto industry have 
beaten back efforts by legislators such as Democrat, Senator John Kerry 
and Republican John McCain to gradually increase fuel efficiency 
standards from the abysmally wasteful levels now inflicted on your 
pocketbook.  Instead of choosing the path of reduced pollution, consumer 
savings, efficiency of engines and less reliance on imported oil, these 
indentured lawmakers turned their back on automotive engineers who know 
how to do the job but are not allowed by their bosses.
    <p>The Sierra Club has decided to stop spinning its wheels on Capitol 
Hill and go directly to the people.  In surveys of likely voters in 
Missouri and South Dakota, 79 percent of the people wanted the auto 
industry to be required to increase fuel efficiency and that included 
light truck owners.  The voters do not buy the auto company propaganda 
that more fuel efficient vehicles means less safety.  Sixty percent of 
these voters say they would pay more for a higher mileage vehicle in 
return for its much larger dollar savings.
   <p>Long time car owners know that fuel efficiency overall is no better 
than what vehicles did in 1980!  They are wary of the sudden spikes in 
gasoline prices.  They also know that the companies spend lots of money 
on engine hyper-performance rather than on engine hyper-efficiency.  
Despite massive advertising by the auto companies to the contrary, they 
do not believe them.
      
<p>Bolstered by public opinion, the Sierra Club announced a three year campaign 
to pressure automakers to improve fuel economy. Executive Director, Carl Pope, 
said "The technology exists today to allow the automakers to continue offering 
their most popular models, but with significantly improved fuel economy. These 
new safe, fuel-saving SUVs and pickups could be on the shelf very soon." (see 
<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org" target="_new">www.sierraclub.org</a> for specific 
examples) 
<p>The Sierra Club is publicizing a "Freedom Option Package", which is 
a set of fuel-saving components that could be added to most standard 
models and that, taken together, could put the fleets of the Big Three 
on the road to 40 miles per gallon.
   <p> Dan Becker, the Club's Clean Energy director says that "Detroit 
wants to sell option packages featuring seat warmers and cup holders" 
instead.  He is mobilizing the Club's 700,000 members across the country 
to hold events at local auto dealers.  Becker has enlisted a prominent 
Chevrolet dealer, Chuck Frank in support of this initiative.
    <p>The Sierra Club, once enthralled by Bill Ford's environmental 
statements and assurances of major increases in Ford's SUV's is now so 
disappointed with his company's joining the other auto giants to lobby 
against fuel-efficiency laws that it has singled him and Ford Motor 
Company for special pressure by motorists.
      <p>Soon to come (September 17th) is the most jolting book against the auto 
        company executives since Unsafe at Any Speed came out in 1965. I am referring 
        to New York Times reporter, Keith Bradsher's devastating expose of the 
        SUVs which he calls the world's most dangerous vehicles and how they got 
        that way. Titled <i>The High and Mighty</i>, this book explains how the 
        auto industry's grip on Congress got these SUVs (hoked-up, over-priced 
        light truck) exempted form safety, fuel efficiency and pollution requirements 
        that were imposed on automobiles. That was accomplished when these vehicles 
        were a small percentage of overall sales. Now they are a large part of 
        sales; they kill their occupants in roll overs three times the rate of 
        cars; areuniquely dangerous to other motorists and will become more serious 
        when drunks, teenagers, typically the worst drivers on the road, start 
        buying the older used SUVs, Bradsher says. 
      <p>With an impressive attention to detail and special documentation, 
Bradsher reports on the enormous advertising money ($10 billion spent 
since 1990) to deceive their customers and persuade Americans to switch 
from cars to the very profitable SUVs.  While, he declares, 
"Gas-guzzling SUVs emit one-third more global-warming gases per mile 
than cars, and up to 5.5 times as much smog-causing nitrogen oxides per 
mile."
    <p>If the media grasps the importance of this book, September will be a 
hot month for the high and mighty in Detroit's executive suites.  And 
long overdue.</p>
