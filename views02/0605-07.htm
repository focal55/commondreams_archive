<p><i> Common Dreams Editor's Note: This is a response to David Corn's &quot;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0531-03.htm">The September 11 X-Files</a>&quot; originally published in <a href="http://www.thenation.com" target="_new">The Nation</a> on 5/30/02 and featured by Common Dreams on 5/31/02.</i></p>
<p>To David Corn and Common Dreams:</p>
<p>Your latest missive is surprising for its 
                      weakness. It deserves only the briefest of responses because, 
                      as an avalanche of information continues to demonstrate, 
                      the U.S.
                      government did have foreknowledge of the attacks and there 
                      was an orchestrated effort to allow the attacks to occur. 
                      FBI Special Agent Robert Wright’s recent press conference 
                      is but another brick in a wall that grows sturdier by the 
                      day. Time is on my side here.</p>
<p>I’ll quickly pass over many of the erroneous 
                      points in your story to get to just 
                      a couple that warrant two or three sentences. Allen Dulles’ 
                      old quip that “the American people don’t read” has changed 
                      with the Internet and it will afford you no cover.</p>
<p>It’s OK that you misrepresented my LAPD 
                      record by taking items completely out of context. My full 
                      LAPD record has been on my web site for months at <a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com" target="_new">www.fromthewilderness.com</a> 
                      for the world to look at and see what you have done. I expect 
                      that from you. </p>
<p>It’s OK that you misrepresent and state 
                      that I have hung the entirety of my credibility on the Delmart 
                      “Mike” Vreeland case. I have published 56 stories since 
9/11/01 and only six of them 
                      have been about Mike Vreeland. I expect 
                      that as well. </p>
<p>It’s OK that you state that I am not a 
                      reporter when you fail to mention stories like my investigative 
                      report of horrendous conflicts of interest regarding Attorney 
                      General John Ashcroft and 
                      two sitting federal grand juries 
                      where I conducted many interviews. It’s OK also that you 
                      ignore all of the other reportage I have done since 9/11. 
                      I expect that too.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It’s really not OK, however, that you state 
                      that I have misrepresented stories like a Feb. 
                      13, 2001 story by UPI correspondent Richard Sale 
                      wherein I reported that court records indicated that the 
                      NSA had broken Osama bin Laden’s secure encrypted communications. 
                      You wrote, “But in several instances he [Ruppert] misrepresents 
                      his source material. </p>
<p>“… [T]he actual story noted not that the 
                      U.S. government had gained the capacity to eavesdrop on 
                      bin Laden at will but that it had ‘gone into foreign bank 
                      accounts… and deleted or transferred funds, and jammed 
                      or blocked the group’s cell or satellite phones.’”</p>
<p>Here is a direct quote from Sale’s story 
                      which proves that your accusation is false: “The U.S. case 
                      unfolding against him [bin Laden] in United States District 
                      court in Manhattan is based mainly on National Security 
                      Agency intercepts of phone calls between bin Laden and his 
                      operatives around the world – Afghanistan to London, from 
                      Kenya to the United States.</p>
<p>“… Fawwaz also provided satellite phones 
                      for other members of the bin Laden group, ‘to facilitate 
                      communications,’ the indictment said…</p>
<p>“On August 11, two days after the bombings 
                      were completed, bin Laden’s satellite number phone was used 
                      to contact network operatives in Yemen, at a number frequently 
                      called by perpetrators of the bombing from their safe house 
                      in Nairobi.</p>
<p>“Since 1995, bin Laden has tried to protect 
                      his communications with ‘a full suite of tools,’ according 
                      to Ben Venzke, director of intelligence, special projects 
                      for iDefense…</p>
<p>“Since bin Laden started to encrypt certain 
                      calls in 1995, why would they now be part of a court record? 
                      ‘Codes were broken,’ US officials said…”</p>
<p>Is this the best that The Nation can do? 
                      With that in mind I’ll conclude by saying that it is becoming 
                      increasingly clear to news consumers around the world that 
                      The Nation is serving and defending the interests of a corrupt 
                      and illegitimate government while my publication, “From 
                      The Wilderness” is truly concerned with the safety, well-being 
                      and empowerment of its growing readership. The marketplace 
                      is operating in a healthy capacity. It is also apparent 
                      that your actual knowledge of how covert operations work 
                      is as limited as your forensic abilities. For more than 
                      20 years I have investigated many intelligence cases and 
                      I have dealt directly with principals in cases involving 
                      Edwin Wilson, Albert Carone, Dois “Chip” Tatum, William 
                      Tyree, “Bo” Gritz, Scott Weekly, Scott Barnes, Al Martin 
                      and yes, even your beloved Ted Shackley.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1999 two investigators from 
                      the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence traveled 
                      to Los Angeles 
                      and copied 6,000 pages of my records. In the fall of 2000 
                      two members of the RCMP National Security Staff - Sean McDade 
                      and Randy Buffam – came to  Los Angeles, 
                      visited me and copied several hundred pages of files in 
                      my possession regarding Promis software.</p>
<p>If, at any time, you would like an instruction 
                      on how easy it would have been for the Bush administration 
                      and the intelligence community to have allowed the attacks 
                      of 9/11 to occur without involving massive numbers of people 
                      being consciously aware of it I will make the time. That 
                      is of course, if it really is your desire to arm the American 
                      people with the truth. As to integrity, let’s see if Common 
                      Dreams has enough to publish my response. “By their fruits 
                      ye shall know them.”</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
