<p>The evening of Sept. 11, I wrote an <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0912-08.htm">essay</a> 
that ended with a plea that "the insanity stop here," that the brutal act of terrorism 
not spark more terrorism, theirs or ours. 
<p> But the insanity didn't stop. 
<p> Instead, the Bush administration cynically manipulated people's grief and 
rage to unleash an unlimited war against endless enemies, which has made the world 
more dangerous and the American people less secure in any land, home or abroad. 
<p> A year later, it's clear the so-called "war on terrorism" is primarily a war 
to project U.S power around the world. Its goal is to extend and deepen U.S. control, 
especially in the energy-rich Middle East and Central Asia. Ordinary people have 
not benefited, and will not benefit, from this war or the economics that drive 
it. 
<p> The antiwar movement argued from the start that conventional war could not 
produce security from terrorism, and we were right. Administration officials this 
summer acknowledged that the attack on Afghanistan didn't significantly diminish 
the terrorist threat and may have complicated counterterrorism efforts by dispersing 
potential attackers. 
<p> Those of us who criticized the mad rush to war also suggested the Bush administration 
would use terrorism as a pretext to justify a wider war; again, we were right. 
Officials have floundered trying to justify an attack on Iraq with claims about 
Iraqi connections to al-Qaida or other terrorist networks that are so unconvincing 
they have largely been abandoned. 
<p> Claims about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction are more plausible, 
but riddled with inconsistencies. Iraq may have developed, or be developing, limited 
biological or chemical weapons programs, but no one has offered proof or a scenario 
in which Iraq might use them, except in the case of a U.S. attack. And the Bush 
administration has repeatedly announced that it won't be satisfied with renewed 
weapons inspections and is determined to topple the Saddam Hussein regime, destroying 
hopes for the diplomacy needed for multilateral regional arms control. 
<p> Bush's talk of democracy in Afghanistan or Iraq is a bad joke. U.S. manipulation 
of the political process in Afghanistan to install a handpicked puppet, Hamid 
Karzai (now being guarded by U.S. troops and agents to protect him from his own 
people), was barely concealed. In Iraq, "democracy" will be acceptable to the 
Bush administration so long as a democratic process produces a similarly pliant 
leader. 
<p> These failed attempts to build a case for war only highlight what has long 
been clear: The war in Afghanistan and a possible war in Iraq are about U.S. dominance, 
at two levels. The first involves the specific resources of those regions. In 
the case of Afghanistan, the concern is pipelines to carry the oil and natural 
gas of the Caspian region to deep-water ports. In Iraq, it's about controlling 
the country with the world's second-largest oil reserves. 
<p> Beyond those direct interests, the logic of empire requires violence on this 
scale; when challenged, imperial powers strike back to maintain credibility and 
extend control. U.S. control is through mechanisms different from Rome or Britain 
in their imperial phases, but there can be no doubt that we are an empire. 
<p> Much of the world is frightened by these imperial ambitions. A friend traveling 
in Europe reports back that people talk of their fear of America's militarism. 
Politicians in allied nations are questioning, or openly repudiating, American 
war plans. 
<p> The task for U.S. citizens is clear: We must ensure that the U.S. empire is 
the first empire dismantled from within, through progressive political movements 
that reject world dominance that perpetuates inequality in favor of our place 
in a world struggling for justice and peace. 
<p> On Sept. 11, we got a glimpse of what it might look like if the empire is 
taken down from the outside. 
<p> Today we still have a choice. We can learn from history and step back from 
empire, or suffer the fate that history makes clear lies down the imperial path. 
<p> We still have time to turn away from empire and toward democracy, away from 
unilateralism toward engagement, away from hoarding power and toward seeking peace. 
<p> We still have time to demand of our government that the insanity stop here.
