<p>For many months the people of the world have been trying to figure out just 
what it is that President Bush is trying to do. Many people think the administration's 
goals are simply to enrich themselves and their supporters. Others cite this war 
as an attempt at "closure on the Gulf War" - the son completing the father's job. 
Still more believe oil is the primary goal. An astonishing document has come to 
light that finally puts the pieces of the puzzle together.
<p>The name of this most revealing report is "Rebuilding America's Defenses." 
Details of this treatise was written by Jay Bookman, deputy editorial page editor 
of the Atlanta Journal-Consitiution, and published on Sept. 29. "The official 
story on Iraq has never made sense," Bookman writes. "The connection that the 
Bush administration has tried to draw between Iraq and al-Qaida has always seemed 
contrived and artificial. In fact, it was hard to believe that smart people in 
the Bush administration would start a major war based on such flimsy evidence." 
He continues, "The pieces didn't fit. Something else had to be going on; something 
was missing."
<p>The report was written five months before the attacks of Sept. 11 and is authored by six members of the current administration, including Paul Wolfowitz, John Bolton, I. Lewis Libby, along with 21 other people who attended meetings or contributed papers for the report. Bookman goes on to explain what the plans are for world military domination and how Bush has mirrored those plans so far. "In essence, it lays out a plan for a permanent U.S. military and economic domination of every region on the globe, unfettered by international treaty or concern. And to make the plan a reality, it envisions a stark expansion of our global military presence."<p>"Rebuilding America's Defenses" puts the entire world on notice. America will get what it wants, from any country on earth, by any means necessary. If we perceive resistance ("a threat to national security") we reserve the right to strike preemptively with or without the support of another country. The authors of this amazing manifesto dream of an American Empire with George W. Bush as its first emperor. Bookman goes on to say, "They envision the creation of what they call a worldwide 'Pax Americana,' or American peace. But so far, the American people have not appreciated the true extent of that ambition."<p>Apparently neither do our elected representatives. Calls to Olympia Snowe's office and Susan Collins' office yielded no knowledge of such a document. There has been no discussion of this vision of Pax Americana in the congressional debates. Not surprisingly! If they were to debate such a scheme it would lend legitimacy to the Bush plan for expanding America's military domination just before the elections. If the American people really understood the implications of this plan how would they react? How would our allies react? How will our adversaries react?<p>This scheme presents scenarios of apocalyptic proportions. The world's resources are limited; our power is not. If we control the resources, we could control the world. But what about the people who live in those resource rich countries? Will they simply join with us to promote Pax Americana, quietly acquiescing to our demands? Is it not likely that resistance will be encountered from every quarter in every way possible?<p>What terrors await us as we accumulate more of the world's wealth and territory? Will this truly create "American Peace"? How many more American citizens will be required to enlist in the armed forces to replace the "spent assets" as time drags on? What cost will we be required to bear for this scheme? The war on Iraq is estimated to reach $100 billion and that's just the first country in the Axis of Evil. What sacrifices must we accept to fund this vision? Once we conquer one country how will we hold on to it while going on to the next, and the next? Will we go the way of the Soviet Union, bankrupt by our own military overspending and overreaching ambition? Rome's empire collapsed and the world settled into the Dark Ages. Who can predict what fate awaits us if we should fail?<p>Now we are about to hand over the decision to use that power to President George W. Bush. Once given it will be nearly impossible to rescind. The debate in Washington might sound like it is about Iraq and it's despised leader and weapons of mass destruction. But is it not time to ask if it is really about "Rebuilding America's Defenses" - Pax Americana? Whether knowingly or not, a vote for a resolution to give him the unfettered power to attack Iraq also gives Bush or Cheney or whoever wields the power of the Presidency the green light to attempt to conquer the world. Is that what we want our congresspersons to do? Perhaps it is time to start asking those who make this decision exactly what we are agreeing to.
