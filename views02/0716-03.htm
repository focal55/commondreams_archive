<p>What about states' rights?</p>
<p>Before Enron, WorldCom and the rest of the Wall Street hustler stories broke, 
in this most recent wave of corporate criminality, anti-globalization protesters 
and other factions of what I loosely refer to as the economic justice movement 
were derided by even the liberal media as being senseless when it comes to economics.</p>
<p>But now that the bad apple theory has been exposed as a red herring offered 
by unregulated free-market worshippers, those so-called idiots who took to the 
streets of Seattle in 1999 appear to be, well, prophetic.</p>
<p>The muted message coming out of the protests has been: There's something wrong 
with the global economic system itself -- namely, a lack of democratic accountability.</p>
<p>And now, with even our business-is-king president conceding the point, we can 
finally have a discussion about corporate responsibility and social ethics without 
some F.A. Hayek or Milton Friedman fanatic drowning out opposition voices by using 
meaningless political epithets like "you're a socialist, Marxist, communist, liberal."</p>
<p>Late last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, "Ultimately, the proposals 
Mr. Bush advanced in (his) speech on Wall Street may well serve as the floor rather 
than the ceiling for Washington action."</p>
<p>Following the president's address, the Senate moved to go beyond Bush's timid 
proposals, voting 97-0 to establish sweeping new powers to target corporate fraud, 
creating a new corporate-fraud chapter in the federal criminal code.</p>
<p>The Senate also voted 96-0 to toughen criminal penalties for white-collar crimes, 
such as pension fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy -- a provision that would, according 
to the Journal, "allow courts to mete out the same punishments to guilty executives 
as now apply to drug kingpins."</p>
<p>The essence of what the Senate was trying to do was captured by Vermont Democrat 
Patrick Leahy when he said: "If you steal a $500 television set, you can go to 
jail. Apparently if you steal $500 million from your corporation and your pension 
holders and everyone else, then nothing happens. This makes sure something will 
happen." That's an implicit admission that our criminal justice system has long 
served the interest of the wealthy at the expense of the less affluent.</p>
<p>And not that anyone was expecting it, but the president could have appointed 
an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Dick Cheney's tenure at Halliburton, 
amid allegations by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch that 
the oil-field services business headed by Cheney engaged in fraudulent accounting 
practices from 1999 to 2001. It kind of puts the Clinton-Whitewater affair in 
a whole new perspective.</p>
<p>So now that the momentum has shifted toward greater corporate accountability, 
maybe the ideas coming out of such organizations as the Program on Corporations, 
Law and Democracy (POCLAD) will get broader consideration. That will remind us 
that the sovereignty rights of real people come before so-called corporate rights, 
as the framers of our Constitution intended (see <a href="http://www.poclad.org" target="_new">www.poclad.org</a>).</p>
<p>It was through pro-corporate judicial activism in the early 1900s that the 
Constitution and concept of private property found therein came to be interpreted 
as justification for the legal absurdities we have today in which individual rights 
and liberties meant for flesh-and-blood human beings are extended to corporations.</p>
<p>Want some relevant summer reading? Check out POCLAD's collection of essays 
and speeches called "Defying Corporations, Defining Democracy." In that book, 
I found this gem from an 1890 New York Court of Appeals case, involving the North 
River Sugar Refining Corp.</p>
<p>Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Finch declared: "The judgment sought 
against the defendant is one of corporate death ... The life of a corporation 
is, indeed, less than that of the humblest citizen ... Corporations may, and often 
do, exceed their authority only where private rights are affected. When these 
are adjusted, all mischief ends and all harm is averted.</p>
<p>"But where the transgression has a wider scope, and threatens the welfare of 
the people, they may summon the offender to answer for the abuse of its franchise 
or the violation of its corporate duty. The (North River Sugar Refining) corporation 
has violated its charter, and failed in the performance of its corporate duties, 
and that in respects so material and important to justify a judgment of dissolution 
... All concur."</p>
<p>Corporations used to be under the authority of the states in which they were 
chartered. Where are states' rights advocates on this issue today?</p>
<p>Why are they not echoing the sentiments of our great nation's founders -- such 
people as Thomas Jefferson, who spoke of the need "to crush in its birth the aristocracy 
of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to 
a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country"?</p>
