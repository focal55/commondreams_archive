<p> For years, experts have been saying we have only 40 or so years of cheap, 
available crude oil left. Now some of the world's leading petroleum geologists 
are suggesting that global oil production could peak and begin a steep decline 
as early as the end of this decade, sending oil prices through the roof. Increasing 
tensions between the West and Islamic countries, where most of the world's oil 
is produced, could further threaten our access to affordable oil.
<p>In desperation, the United States and other nations could turn increasingly 
to dirtier fossil fuels--coal, tar sand and heavy oil--which would only worsen 
global warming and imperil the Earth's already beleaguered ecosystems.
<p>There is a better way to go: hydrogen power.
<p> Weaning the world off oil and turning it toward hydrogen, however, will require 
a concerted effort by industry, government and local communities on a scale comparable 
to the efforts in the 1980s and 1990s that helped create the World Wide Web.
<p>Hydrogen is the most basic and ubiquitous element in the universe. It is the 
"forever fuel," producing no harmful carbon dioxide emissions when burned and 
giving off as byproducts only heat and pure water. All that needs to be done is 
to extract hydrogen from various elements so that it is useable in fuel cells.
<p>The commercially usable hydrogen currently being produced is extracted mostly 
from natural gas. However, renewable sources of energy--wind, hydro, photovoltaic, 
geothermal, biomass--are increasingly being used to generate electricity locally, 
and in the future that electricity will in turn be used to electrolyze water and 
separate out hydrogen that can be used to power fuel cells.
<p>Commercial fuel cells powered by hydrogen are just now being introduced into 
the market for home, office and industrial use. The major auto makers have spent 
more than $2 billion on development of hydrogen cars, buses and trucks; the first 
mass-produced vehicles are expected to be on the road in just a few years.
<p>Exactly how soon we will all be driving hydrogen cars will depend on a number 
of factors, including the price of oil on world markets, the availability of hydrogen 
refueling stations and numerous other technical questions in the manufacturing 
process itself.
<p>Even given these stumbling blocks, many energy experts believe that over the 
next several decades hydrogen fuel cells will become our best source of energy. 
And the rise of this source of power would open the way for fundamental changes 
in our markets and political and social institutions, just as coal and steam power 
did at the beginning of the Industrial Age.
<p>The hydrogen economy would make possible a vast redistribution of power. Today's 
centralized, top-down flow of energy, controlled by global oil companies and utilities, 
would become obsolete. In the new era, every human being could become the producer 
as well as the consumer of his or her own energy--so-called "distributed generation."
<p>When millions of users connect their fuel cells by hooking into existing power 
grids, using the same design principles and smart technologies that made possible 
the Web, they can begin to share energy peer-to-peer--creating a new, decentralized 
form of energy use.
<p>In the hydrogen fuel cell era, even the automobile itself would be a "power 
station on wheels" with a generating capacity of 20 kilowatts. Since the average 
car is parked most of the time, it could be plugged in, during nonuse hours, to 
the home, office or the main interactive electricity network, providing premium 
electricity back to the grid.
<p>When the end users also become the producers of their energy, the only role 
remaining for existing power plants is to become "virtual power plants" that can 
manufacture and market fuel cells, bundle energy services and coordinate the flow 
of energy over the existing power grids.
<p>Hydrogen would dramatically cut down on carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate 
the effects of global warming. And because hydrogen is so plentiful and exists 
everywhere, every human being, once we all become masters of the technology, could 
be "empowered," resulting in the first truly democratic energy regime in history.
<p>Nowhere would hydrogen energy be more important than in the developing world.
<p>Incredibly, 65% of the human population has never made a single telephone call, 
and one-third has no access to electricity or any other form of commercial energy.
<p>Lack of access to energy, especially electricity, is a key factor in perpetuating 
poverty around the world.
<p>Conversely, access to energy means more economic opportunity. In South Africa, 
for example, for every 100 households electrified, 10 to 20 new businesses are 
created.
<p>Electricity frees human labor from day-to-day survival tasks. In resource-poor 
countries, simply finding enough firewood or dung to warm a house or cook meals 
can take hours out of each day.
<p>Electricity provides power to run farm equipment, operate small factories and 
craft shops and light homes, schools and businesses.
<p>As the price of hydrogen fuel cells and accompanying appliances plummets with 
new innovations and economies of scale, cells will become more available, as was 
the case with transistor radios, computers and cellular phones. The goal ought 
to be to provide stationary fuel cells for every neighborhood and village in the 
developing world. 
<p>The road to global security lies in lessening our dependence on Middle East 
oil and making sure that all people on Earth have access to the energy they need 
to sustain life. The hydrogen economy is a promissory note for a safer world.
