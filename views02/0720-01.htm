<p>Wagging the dog no longer cuts it. If the Bush administration wants to distract 
Americans from watching their 401(k)'s go down the toilet, it will have to unleash 
the whole kennel. </p>
<P> Maybe only unilateral annihilation of the entire axis of evil will do. Though 
the fate of John Walker Lindh was once a national obsession, its resolution couldn't 
knock Wall Street from the top of the evening news this week. Neither could the 
president's White House lawn rollout of his homeland security master plan. When 
John Ashcroft, in full quiver, told Congress that the country was dotted with 
Al Qaeda sleeper cells "waiting to strike again," he commanded less media attention 
than Ted Williams's corpse.</p>
<P> What riveted Americans instead was the spectacle of numbers tumbling as the 
president gave two speeches telling us help was on the way. For his first pitch, 
he appeared against a blue background emblazoned with the repeated legend "Corporate 
Responsibility." Next came a red backdrop, with "Strengthening Our Economy" as 
the double-vision-inducing slogan. What will be strike three — black-and-white 
stripes and "Dick Cheney Is Not a Crook"? Maybe this rah-rah technique helped 
boost the numbers back when George W. Bush was head cheerleader in prep school. 
But he's not at Andover anymore. Where his father's rhetoric gave us a thousand 
points of light, his lopped a thousand points off the Dow.</p>
<P> Once the market dissed him, the president waxed philosophical, if not Aristotelian, 
professing shock that his fellow citizens would care about something as base as 
money. Invoking Sept. 11, he said, "I believe people have taken a step back and 
asked, `What's important in life?' You know, the bottom line and this corporate 
America stuff, is that important? Or is serving your neighbor, loving your neighbor 
like you'd like to be loved yourself?" </p>
<P> Easy for him to say. It's hard to engage in lofty meditation about loving 
your neighbor if your neighbor is Kenneth Lay or Gary Winnick or Bernard Ebbers 
or any other insider in "corporate America stuff" who escaped with multimillions 
just before the corporation cratered, taking your job or pension or both with 
it. </p>
<P> Democrats celebrate the Republicans' travails as if it were Christmas in July. 
But the party's chief, Terry McAuliffe, was a Winnick crony who made his own killing 
before Global Crossing tanked, and its most visible presidential candidate, Joseph 
Lieberman, is fighting to the political death for loosey-goosey stock-option accounting. 
Just as the Harken-Halliburton stories gathered fuel, such tribunes of the people 
as Tom Daschle, Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry boarded corporate jets supplied 
by companies like Eli Lilly and <org idsrc="NYSE" value="BLS">BellSouth</org> 
to rendezvous in Nantucket with their favor-seeking fat cats. </p>
<P> But the hypocrisies of the Democrats, however sleazy in their own right, do 
not cancel out the burgeoning questions about this White House. Each time Mr. 
Bush protests that only a few bad apples ail corporate America, that mutant orchard 
inches closer to the Rose Garden. If there's not a systemic problem in American 
business, there does seem to be one in the administration, and it cannot be cordoned 
off from the rest of its official behavior. Compartmentalization, Republicans 
of all people should know, went out of style with the Clinton administration. 
</p>
<P> In the real world, everything connects. What is most revealing about Mr. Bush's 
much-touted antidote to the bad apples, his "financial crimes SWAT team," is how 
closely it mimics <org idsrc="NYSE" value="ENRNQ;ENE-J">Enron's</org> Cayman Island 
shell subsidiaries. It exists mainly on paper, as a cutely named entity with no 
real assets. It calls for no new employees or funds and won't even gain new F.B.I. 
agents to replace those whom the bureau reassigned from white-collar crime to 
counterterrorism after Sept. 11. </p>
<P> The SWAT team's main purpose is to bolster the administration's poll numbers 
as the Enron off-the-books partnerships did its corporate parent's stock price. 
And like its prototypes, it may already be going south. No sooner did the SWAT 
team's chief, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, hold his first photo op 
than The <org idsrc="NYSE" value="WPO">Washington Post</org> revealed that he 
was an alumnus of yet another bad apple, the credit-card giant Providian. Mr. 
Thompson had headed the board's audit and compliance committee and escaped with 
$5 million before the company threw thousands of employees out of work and paid 
more than $400 million to settle allegations of consumer and securities fraud.</p>
<P> Even the war on terrorism is not immune from Enron-style governance by this 
administration. Last weekend Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta reported in The Times 
that the Halliburton unit KBR got a unique sweetheart deal with the Army last 
December, despite being a reputed bill-padder and the target of a criminal investigation. 
Why? Call it the perfect Halliburton-Enron storm. The company grabbing the deal 
is the former employer of the vice president. The government agency granting the 
deal, the Army, reports to the former Enron executive Thomas White, who is nothing 
if not consistent: he doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars any more zealously than 
he did his former shareholders'.</p>
<P> We still don't know the full extent of our Enron governance because we still 
don't have a complete list of former Enron employees hired by the Bush administration. 
(It hardly inspires confidence to know that one of them is its chief economic 
adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, who also offered such valuable wisdom to Ken Lay.) 
Nor, of course, do we know the full details of the president's past history at 
<org idsrc="AMEX" value="HEC">Harken Energy</org> or the vice president's at Halliburton. 
Those details matter not so much because of any criminality they might reveal 
— we are rapidly learning that there is no such thing as a prosecutable corporate 
crime anyway — but because of what they may add to our knowledge of the ethics, 
policies and personnel of a secretive administration to which we've entrusted 
both our domestic and economic security. </p>
<P> What we know about Harken so far is largely due to the S.E.C. documents unearthed 
and posted since 2000 by the enterprising and nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, 
also a leader in uncovering the Clinton administration's Lincoln Bedroom scandals. 
"It's Forrest Gump does finance," says Charles Lewis, the center's founder, in 
looking at the story line of the remarkable George W. Bush business career. "Every 
time he seemed to be in trouble, he would end up with a box of chocolates."</p>
<P> The president's self-contradictory defense of his past is to say he was "fully 
vetted" by the S.E.C. even though he still hasn't "figured it out completely" 
himself. But the S.E.C. never interviewed Mr. Bush during its investigation. The 
agency was then run by an appointee of his father, Richard Breeden, who recused 
himself from the case. Last Sunday, Mr. Breeden turned up on Fox News as a George 
W. defender. Yet when Tony Snow asked him twice if he could give the president 
"a clean bill of health, yes or no," Mr. Breeden pleaded ignorance and ducked. 
Perhaps that's why the White House has not asked the S.E.C. to release its Harken 
papers, even though Harvey Pitt last weekend said he would if it did. The president 
has also told the press that "you need to look back on the director's minutes" 
to answer questions about Harken — and then refused to provide those minutes or 
to instruct Harken to release them either. But yesterday Mr. Lewis's organization 
posted a pile of them at www.publicintegrity.org, and says that more documents 
are yet to come.</p>
<P> What is the president hiding? Clearly the story here is not merely a hard-to-prove 
case of insider trading, tardy stock-sale forms and Mr. Bush's knowledge of the 
sham transaction involving Aloha Petroleum. Most likely it also involves the mystery 
first raised by The Wall Street Journal and Time in 1991. Back then, their investigative 
journalists tried to break the cronyism code by which tiny Harken, which had never 
drilled a well overseas, miraculously beat out the giant Amoco for a prized contract 
for drilling in Bahrain. They also tried to learn what various Saudi money men, 
some tied to the terrorist-sponsoring Bank of Credit and Commerce International, 
may have had to do with Harken while the then-president's son was in proximity.</p>
<P> These questions, like the companion questions about Halliburton's dealings 
with Iraq on Mr. Cheney's watch, are not ancient history but will gain in relevance 
in direct proportion to the expansion of the war on terrorism and the decline 
of the Dow. Sooner or later George W. Bush will have to answer them, because even 
though he cares more about loving his neighbors than the bottom line, the rest 
of us are just irredeemably crass.</p>
