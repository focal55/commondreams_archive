<p>I am saddened to say that in Peru the government's propaganda against those
who stand up for their rights and seek social change continues.  New laws
have been passed which put greater restriction on social mobilization.  And
following the March car bombing in Lima, the responsibility for which still
has not yet been determined, the government has proposed new anti-terrorist
laws which perpetuate the internationally condemned laws pushed through by
Alberto Fujimori a decade ago that are in violation of fundamental human
rights.  On the other hand, recently passed labor legislation to respect the
eight-hour workday and overtime pay is not being enforced.  It sometimes
seems that the only law enforcement that exists in Peru is that which
represses.

<p>Once again political prisoners are being abused.  In late April, political
prisoners were transferred to Challapalca, a jail located high in the
mountains in a military base close to the Andean border with Bolivia and
Chile at an altitude exceeding 16,000 feet.  Several human rights
organizations including the International Red Cross and Amnesty
International stated strong objections to the opening of the Challapalca
jail in 1996.  It was originally used for holding common prisoners but seven
months ago, early in the Toledo administration, the first group of political
prisoners was moved to Challapalca.   The health of all prisoners is
seriously threatened in that jail, as is their general well being.  The
Challapalca jail is so remote and so isolated that any abuse can occur there
with total impunity -- proof of which is that about a year or so ago two
common prisoners were beaten to death by prison guards and this incident
wasn't even known until much later.  Owing to the cost and the difficulty of
traveling there, as well as the difficulty of adjusting to the altitude,
visits to prisoners at this jail are minimal.

<p>In addition to continuing threats to move more political prisoners to
Challapalca, now that Puno's high-plane Yanamayo jail was recently repaired,
political prisoners also are being threatened with transfer there.

<p>We political prisoners are living in a generalized atmosphere of
provocation  -- problems with the food, harassment of visitors, suspension of
privileges, etc.   Over the last months, and especially in the last weeks,
prisoners' families and friends and even prisoners' lawyers as well as human
rights workers who visit jails have been threatened and treated with
hostility.

<p>When prison authorities remark disdainfully about the presence of
international human rights organizations it is because of the pressure that
such groups put on limiting the authorities' impunity.  The Justice Ministry
claims that the denouncements of abuse by political prisoners are false,
maintaining that prisoners' human rights are respected.  This is simply not
true.  But in a country in which there is little concern if the majority of
the population suffers daily violation of their fundamental human rights as
stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, who will care if
our rights are not respected, more so because political prisoners aren't
even considered to be human beings?

<p>These latest actions by the Peruvian government are a renewed reprisal
against political prisoners who struggle for their rights.  I fear for the
well being of those prisoners who have been moved to Challapalca, as I do
for all political prisoners in Peru who may be abused in any jail at any
time.  One cannot remain quiet when the government hypes false images of the
supposed "danger of terrorism" as represented by political prisoners, and
diverts attention from resolving the problems of poverty and the root causes
of social unrest.

<p>Coming so soon after the decade of Fujimori-Montesinos repression, I am
concerned that the worsening of this current situation and the continued
serious infringement of basic rights in a country that calls itself a
democracy will cause irreconcilable conflict that will take years to
eradicate.

<p>It is necessary these things be known and, as I am able to, I will keep you
informed of how this situation progresses.  Meanwhile, you can help by
writing to Justice Minister Olivera, President Toledo, and the national
human rights organizations to demand that the Peruvian government stop the
repression against political prisoners and demonstrate respect for human
rights by closing the Challapalca jail and moving all the prisoners to other
jails.

<p>Thank you.
