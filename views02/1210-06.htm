<p>As I write this, the snow is falling outside my apartment window. So I've got 
the Christmas spirit bubbling up inside me.</p>
<p>'Tis the season . . . to shop for Christmas presents. But I have a confession 
to make. I'm about to commit a grave sin. I'm actually going to make a few gifts 
this year instead of just buying expensive stuff. That way I will even better 
clutter the lives of loved ones.</p>
<p>Of course, I'll have to buy the cheap materials I'll need to make the gifts. 
So maybe my life will be spared by the merciful, omnipresent god of the market.</p>
<p>But please don't tell the high priests of our consumer culture just how unpatriotic 
I intend to be by not completely living up to my civic duty of shopping 'til I 
drop.</p>
<p>I know the scripture: "Whoever has the most toys wins." It's in the Book of 
Prices, which is right after the Book of Numbers, I think. But I'm a rebel against 
the Claus.</p>
<p>What saves me from being an unredeemable Grinch is that I do enjoy a few Christmas 
carols. "Joy To The World" is my favorite.</p>
<p>Plus, I have a deep interest in that famous woodworker who, it has been rumored, 
is behind all this Christmas business.</p>
<p>Then again, the traditional celebration of Jesus' birth is sometimes referred 
to as Xmas. There's no Christ in that.</p>
<p>But that's a whole other question that some readers would find about as interesting 
as discussing the physics involved in the great theological debate over how many 
angels can dance on the head of a pin.</p>
<p>I happen to think it would make for fascinating conversation, but I won't linger 
long on this, other than to tell you that I got an e-mail last week announcing 
the publication of a new physics book that might shed some light on the angel 
debacle. (A cheap Christmas gift?)</p>
<p>The book is called "Einstein's Theory of Relativity: Scientific Theory or Illusion," 
written by Milan R. Pavlovic -- not to be confused with the behavior psychologist 
who did that famous experiment with drooling dogs.</p>
<p>Evidently, Pavlovic is a graduate of the electro-technical faculty of Belgrade 
University. He spent his life researching, developing and testing military equipment 
in fields ranging from telecommunications to artillery fire-control systems to 
laser and nuclear engineering.</p>
<p>I bet he'd be an engaging guy to have a conversation with, given all this talk 
about weapons of mass destruction going on.</p>
<p>His book is advertised as being a "critical analysis of the special theory 
of relativity as a scientific theory, which, above all, is concerned with questions 
connected with time, space, mass and energy."</p>
<p>Sounds interesting. Unfortunately, I know nothing about physics. Though I can 
speak with authority as one of the consuming masses of energy taking up time and 
space in the universe of buying and selling.</p>
<p>And since 'tis the season of the Prince of Peace, buying gifts and, apparently, 
questioning the big bang theory, I'd like to spread a bit of Xmas cheer by recommending 
a way you can get a bigger bang for your buck as we head off to worship in malls 
all across America.</p>
<p>But first -- did you see that Associated Press story last week about a little, 
teeny-weenie provision in a new federal education law that requires public high 
schools to help recruit for the military by handing over to the Pentagon the names, 
addresses and phone numbers of its juniors and seniors?</p>
<p>In our Orwellian world, where war is peace, the provision is found in the "No 
Child Left Behind" law. </p>
<p>It provides equal opportunity for both male and female students, which might 
have the unintended consequence of making all those who "hate our freedoms" even 
more green with envy.</p>
<p>And now for that merry gift idea I promised.</p>
<p>Have you seen the commercials for those video games with the Tom Clancy-inspired 
characters and scenarios where you can play patriotic war games in which the mission 
is to "appropriate" foreign assets and "destroy" enemies as part of a "ghost recon" 
team, or as a secret "black ops" agent who will be "disavowed" by his own government 
if exposed?</p>
<p>Why bother to re-institute the draft when you can indoctrinate millions of 
young people in the cool ways of appropriating assets and destroying enemies via 
the most sacred secular altar in America -- the television set, complete with 
surround sound?</p>
<p>It's boot camp (without the discipline and moral context provided by the military) 
packaged and sold to the malleable psyches of the video-game generation.</p>
<p>The genius of this idea is evident when you realize this military indoctrination 
is all paid for by private industry. It's a free-marketeer's fantasy -- the funding 
of one of the few good government programs without having to use taxpayer money. 
The revenue comes from the disposable income of patriotic consumers. Brilliant.</p>
<p>Maybe Oscar Wilde was right: "Life is far too important a thing ever to talk 
seriously about it."</p>
<p>Joy to the world.</p>
