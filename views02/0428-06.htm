<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->There is a quiet revolution happening in human rights.  Just ask Laurie King-Irani.

<p>King-Irani is the North American coordinator of an international effort to 
indict Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and other Israelis and Lebanese 
for a massacre committed nearly two decades ago in Lebanon.  Some of the 
survivors filed a complaint last June in a Belgian court against the Israeli 
leader.

<p>The survivors allege that the September 16-18, 1982 massacre in Beirut’s 
Sabra and Shatila refugee camps by Lebanese Phalangist fighters and the 
Israeli military was planned, enabled and directed by Sharon, then Israel’s 
defense minister and the commander of the Israeli Defense Forces.  Israel 
had invaded Lebanon on June 4, 1982 after an attack on an Israeli official 
in London.

<p>At the beginning of the onslaught against the refugees three months later, 
Israeli forces sealed off and surrounded both camps.  Those  trapped inside 
were defenseless Palestinian and Lebanese civilians.

<p>Then, Israeli officials claimed that they were pursuing terrorists. Recently, Israeli officials made a similar claim before attacking the Jenin 
refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, where evidence of another atrocity 
by Israeli forces is emerging, according to the April 25 London Independent.

<p>In 1982, Mrs. Sana Mahmoud Sersawi lived in the Sabra camp.  According to 
her statement in the complaint against Sharon: “The Israelis submitted the 
young people to an interrogation, and the Phalangists delivered 200 people 
to them.  And that’s how neither my husband nor my sister’s husband ever 
came back.”

<p>Mrs. Amal Hussein is another plaintiff who survived but lost family members, 
including her brother and two sisters. She stated that: “All of a sudden, 
the armed Phalangists invaded the area.  No one could leave the house.  All 
we could hear was the screaming of babies and women screaming.  They started 
killing people.”

<p>The complaint against Sharon includes the crime of genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes (<a href="http://www.mallat.com/articles/comp.htm" target="_new">http://www.mallat.com/articles/comp.htm</a>).  
According to Chilbi Mallat, counsel for the plaintiffs, “In international 
law, command responsibility—also known as indirect responsibility—is more 
severe than the responsibility of those who actually do the killing.”

<p>Such principles of universal justice were applied to German Nazi officials.  
They crafted policies of genocide against Jews and others during World War 
II.

<p>Violations of civilians' human rights during armed conflicts or in 
situations of military occupation are, by definition, crimes of war. 
However, King-Irani noted that this principle of international justice has 
not been equally enforced.

<p>“Nobody has been punished or tried for these crimes in Lebanon,” said King-Irani during a recent speaking tour in Northern California.  “This is 
an indication that the public has little knowledge of this.”

<p>In particular, the American people are under-informed about such history.  
Their scant knowledge fits with the Israeli version of the past and present 
echoed by compliant U.S. corporate news media, reliant on official sources 
and dismissive of others.

<p>Nevertheless, the case against Sharon is revolutionizing the world’s notion 
of universal justice, said King-Irani.  The plaintiffs in the Sharon 
complaint are proof of that: regular people bringing charges of war crimes 
against the head of a legal state.

<p>By contrast, during the Cold War, nation-states were sole arbiters of international law, a process rarely exercised.  But that was then.

<p>Now, activists around the world are complementing the efforts of the Sharon 
plaintiffs.

<p>Peter Tatchell is a human rights activist who has sought the arrest of Henry 
Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, for the "killing, injuring 
and displacement" of 3 million people in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam during 
America’s Vietnam War, a violation of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957.

<p>Activists have also been the driving force behind the indictment of Augusto 
Pinochet, Chile's former leader who was indicted in Spain in Oct. 1998.  
Pinochet led the U.S.-backed military overthrow of the nation’s 
democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973, resulting in the 
deaths of thousands, Chileans and Americans.

<p>King-Irani said that a final pre-trial hearing in the complaint against Sharon is set for May 15, with lawyers for the plaintiffs making their final 
arguments.  By this July, the Belgian court will rule if the complaint can 
proceed.

<p>The legal immunity of the world’s tyrants is being tested by people who share a common belief in the virtue of human rights.  The complaint against 
Sharon is part of that silent revolution, indeed.
