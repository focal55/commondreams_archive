<p>Last month, we heard quite a furor about how the FBI and CIA failed us in the 
months leading up to 9/11. How, like children wielding a dull crayon, they failed 
to "connect the dots." Congress is probing; the media is probing; even Egypt and 
Britain claim that they warned the US about terrorist attacks. And now the government 
is gearing up for a new federal information clearinghouse: the freshly empowered 
and consolidated Department of Homeland Security. 
<P>While pundits consider the nuts and bolts of such a proposal, we seem to have 
forgotten that the administration was ill-informed not only about the means of 
terrorism, but about one of the deepest motives behind it.</P>
<P>The USA is widely loathed, but our leaders never fully grasped that before 
last September. Shortly after the attacks, President Bush claimed to be "amazed" 
that anyone hates America, because "I know how good we are." This naivete is a 
failure of "intelligence" not the kind the FBI and CIA specialize in, but a lapsed 
ability to see the global political landscape from any perspective outside one's 
own.</P>
<P>My own exposure to such alternative perspectives was painfully enhanced during 
my fieldwork as an anthropologist in east Africa. I happened to be living in a 
Muslim area of coastal Kenya in 1998 when the US embassies were bombed in Nairobi 
and Dar-es-Salaam. The FBI swarmed to the Muslimized areas of the coast, eventually 
arresting a man (Mohammed Sadiq Odeh) who had circulated through the same towns, 
even the same apartment buildings, where I did my research.</P>
<P>The vast majority of my Muslim Swahili friends and acquaintances would never 
dream of committing such vicious acts, and were sorry for the loss of life. At 
the same time, however, a conspiracy theory began to billow through the community: 
the United States, through a CIA operation, had willfully obliterated its own 
embassies in order to have an excuse for open season on Muslims. President Clinton's 
subsequent bombings of a pharmaceutical company in Sudan and an Al Qaeda training 
site in Afghanistan (back when Al Qaeda was not so infamous) merely confirmed 
my friends' impression that Muslims worldwide were victims of a capricious American 
bully.</P>
<P>Conspiracy theories, it turns out, were hardly new to them; several Swahili 
men bolstered their case by showing me a photocopied letter ostensibly written 
by then-British Prime Minister John Major to his Foreign Office Minister Douglas 
Hogg in 1993. In the letter, Major describes colluding with the United States 
and other Western nations to ensure that the Muslim population are "totally displaced" 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent the emergence of a "possible Islamic state 
in Europe." These harsh prescriptions, he writes, emerge from a "real-politic" 
[sic] based on a broader European "Christian-Civilization and ethic" [sic].</P>
<P>At first, I was maddened by what I saw as the paranoid slant of these narratives, 
and I argued vigorously against them. I pointed out the wild exaggerations and 
near-hilarious grammatical solecisms in the "John Major" letter that clearly indicate 
it wasn't penned by an elite Englishman. I argued that while the CIA is hardly 
a compassionate body, it would never cost the US so much financial damage and 
inconvenience only to justify Clinton's haphazard retaliatory gestures. My friends 
were unmoved. Why?</P>
<P>Conspiracy theories say a lot about their perpetrators. They are weapons of 
the weak, usually circulated by subordinate groups who feel oppressed. They don't 
require evidence to make the rounds; what they need is perceived plausibility. 
My Swahili friends pointed to the scores of children who have died in Iraq because 
of US sanctions. They pointed to Western media bias that favors Israel over Palestine 
and even to the 16th-century Portuguese destruction of Muslim towns on the East 
African coast, an historical moment that stands, to them, as a synecdoche for 
Western/Christian hostility.</P>
<P>They are knowledgeable about world history (even if such knowledge is marred 
by bias and fear), well-connected to Muslim communities in other nations, and, 
as a result, highly suspicious of the United States government. The conspiracy 
theory surrounding the embassy bombings seemed like one way of saying: We may 
not have direct evidence for our claim, but judging from your track record, you 
might as well have done it.</P>
<P>President Bush might be baffled by such accusations, but they are a potent 
symptom of the low regard in which our country is held. I wonder, furthermore, 
if our future attackers are aggrieved not only by US political actions, but also 
by the failure of our country to validate their feelings of oppression. Dare I 
say, in fact, that the despicable final videotape of Daniel Pearl contains a vital 
clue about terrorism that has been overlooked.</P>
<P>Pearl's murderers force him to say that he had come to a new understanding 
of their point of view, and to compare his anguish in captivity to that of the 
prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. The video-makers interspersed Pearl's scripted words 
with images of dead and weeping Middle Easterners, presumably victims of US political 
and military actions. In crafting this pastiche, it is as if they were splicing 
together a fantasy world in which Americans finally understood, in the depths 
of their hearts, the suffering and resentment of some Muslim peoples.</P>
<P>Our government should know that fathoming the point of view of potential terrorists 
is not the same as approving of their acts, but it became "unamerican" right around 
the time Lynn Cheney's ACTA task force spit-roasted a list of academics for pointing 
out why the US is so reviled. Yet to refuse to grasp terrorists' perspective is 
to encourage a short-sightedness that will cost everyone dearly.</P>
<P>So what solution could possibly remedy this problem? I don't aspire to fix 
a global mess, but my experiences in Kenya provided a sharp reminder of the fact 
that a vast number of Muslims across the world (most of them peaceful, humane 
people, and a few of them not) are weighing our country's actions. Every US hypocrisy, 
fib, or denial is registered; every US policy is picked over for the way it affects 
Muslims on political, economic, and humanitarian grounds. A just foreign policy 
then, especially on issues like sanctions against Iraq and the US support for 
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, is the avenue to peace.</P>
<P>Social justice and fairness have not yet motivated the United States government 
to overhaul such policies, but perhaps, once it realizes this is the only long-term 
solution to terror at home, it will be willing to do so on grounds of self-defense.</P>
