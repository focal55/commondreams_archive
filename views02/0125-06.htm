The U.S. military is coming under fire for its treatment of detainees at the 
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Human-rights organizations charge that 
the United States is treating the soldiers, captured in Afghanistan, 
inhumanely and in violation of international law.

<p>During their 20-hour flight from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, the prisoners 
were hooded, shackled and some were reportedly sedated. Hooding is a 
violation of the 1984 Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment. Further, the men's hair and beards were shaved, a 
violation of human dignity under the 1966 International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.

<p>Once they arrived in Cuba, the prisoners were placed in 6-by-8-foot cages 
and exposed to the elements. Jamie Fellner, director of the U.S. Program at 
Human Rights Watch, called this "a scandal," adding, "The United States 
should not be transporting detainees to Cuba until it can provide decent 
shelter."

<p>Photographs of the prisoners caused international outrage. They were shown 
kneeling and bound in shackles and manacles, with masks covering their 
mouths and noses, and goggles with black tape blinding their eyes. The 
International Committee of the Red Cross says the United States might have 
violated the Geneva Convention by distributing photos of the prisoners to 
the international media.

<p>The Pentagon maintains the detainees are treated humanely, receiving 
"culturally appropriate" meals, medical treatment, showers and exercise. And 
military officials justify their actions on the grounds that some detainees 
have threatened to kill their American captors.

<p>According to U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the detainees "will be 
handled not as prisoners of war, because they are not, but as unlawful 
combatants." This is an important distinction, given that under the Geneva 
Convention, POWs must be tried "by the same courts according to the same 
procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the detaining 
power." And unless they are charged with specific war crimes or crimes 
against humanity, POWs are to be released upon the cessation of hostilities.

<p>"The secretary seems unaware of the international requirements of 
international humanitarian law," says Fellner. "As a party to the Geneva 
Conventions, the United States is required to treat every detained combatant 
humanely, including unlawful combatants. The United States may not pick and 
choose among them to decide who is entitled to decent treatment."

<p>Javier Solana, foreign policy chief for the European Union, agrees, saying 
that "the Geneva Convention must be applied to everyone who is detained in 
similar circumstances." Despite Sept. 11, "changing our values and our way 
of life would be terrorism's first victory," Solana said.

<p>Even in Britain, America's closest ally, there is growing concern over the 
treatment of the detainees held at Guantanamo, although the British 
government's support of the United States on the issue has been unwavering. 
The Church of England has made a plea to the United States to apply 
"proportionate and measured justice," and treat the prisoners with "humanity 
and dignity." Kevin McNamara of the Labor Party warned that the West is "in 
danger of losing the moral high ground."

<p>Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the 
legal status of the detainees must be clarified, but in the meantime they 
should be treated as POWs. "They were combatants in an international 
conflict. It may be that some of them have also been involved in the 
al-Qaida conspiracy, that's quite likely, but they are entitled to POW 
status or, if that is defeated, there is provision in the Geneva Convention 
that it goes before a tribunal."

<p>Rumsfeld says that he does not "feel the slightest concern about (the 
prisoners') treatment. They are being treated vastly better than they 
treated anybody else."

<p>He misses the point: Every person around the world is entitled to basic 
standards of treatment as mandated by international law. Merely being better 
than Osama bin Laden should not be our standard.
