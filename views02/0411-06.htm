<i>"A government which spends more on its military than on programs of social 
uplift is approaching spiritual death."</i>
-       Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

<p>As April 15th  nears and Americans devote countless grueling hours toward 
tax preparation, how many people examine where their money actually goes?

<p>Certainly the prospect of shelling out money each spring to the Internal 
Revenue Service does not contribute to an atmosphere of personal 
tranquility and peace in the days and hours before the postmarked envelopes 
and begrudgingly-written checks are sent to the faceless bureaucracy which 
keeps our country afloat.  The process of relinquishing hard-earned money 
sends pangs of frustration and resentment through many people.

<p>Is there a way to make this less painful?  Can we envision a day when we 
give with glee because we know that our taxes ending up in the right 
places, helping the right people and addressing the problems in our society 
which affect us all?  Can we ever become less resentful about paying 
taxes?  Perhaps the answer is found in our priorities.

<p>If you want to personally quantify your values, follow where you spend your 
money.  Are you buying movie tickets, supporting millionaires?  Are you 
buying gasoline?  Shopping at the GAP?  Eating out?  Are you donating to 
worthy causes?  Are you sponsoring an underprivileged child overseas or in 
your town?  If we want to know on an individual level where our priorities 
are, our expenses can provide important clues.

<p>If we want to know where our priorities are on a national scale, we can 
follow our federal spending as well.  This year, our federal budget gives a 
big boost to the military, our way of solving problems 
internationally.  The Osprey aircraft and Virginia attack submarines 
received a combined $4.2 billion dollars and nearly half our budget is 
allocated for past and present military spending.  At the same time, 
significant cuts were made in "programs of social uplift": $700 million in 
job training and employment, $85 million to train doctors in children's 
hospitals, $596 million from the Department of Education and $417 million 
to repair housing.  Interesting.

<p>And the core values which we hold dear are reflected in the national 
budget: power, authority, defense and protection.  Education, healthcare, 
social services and investment in workers get short shrift this year.  Nine 
million children (one in seven) have no health insurance in the United 
States.  One in eight never graduate high school.  One-fourth live with 
only one parent.  Over the next ten years, more than 2.2 million teachers 
will be needed to address the high turnover rate in the educational system 
and compensate for retiring teachers.  The average length of time a new 
teacher sticks with the profession?  Two years.

<p>At the heart of the matter is what really will make us more secure - a big 
military or a healthy, smart, fulfilled population.  Can we actually become 
safer if we are better educated, well-nourished and have well-paying stable 
employment and hope for the future?  Or is a big military the only 
way?  And what do taxes have to do with this?

<p>Almost half of our taxes are applied to keeping our country safe through a 
strong military.

<p>The quote by Dr. King gets at the heart of the matter.  On a personal 
level, we are taught to rely on gadgets like mace, tasers, martial arts and 
self-defense, The Club and complex home security devices to protect our 
stuff and our well-being.  On a national level, we are taught to rely on 
national missile defense, nuclear weapons, a large well-equipped military 
and the theory of mutually assured destruction.  These ploys play upon our 
fears of death and insecurity, and they make a great deal of money for a 
small amount of people.  Imagine if we began to embrace the idea that life 
is fundamentally insecure and that regardless of all the protective 
measures, the gizmos, the gimmicks and the firepower we buy or rely on, 
that our time on earth is limited and fragile.

<p>Moreover, do we need to live in fear and suspicion of others in order to be 
safe?

<p>By addressing the root causes rather than effects of violence - like lack 
of education, low-paying jobs, poor health care, stress and relationship 
problems - through adequate funding and appropriation of financial 
resources shows that American people are at the heart of our concern.  In 
contrast, focusing only on tragedy and insecurity detracts from the 
positive components in American society.

<p>This year, Hart High School in Valencia, CA had to cut funding for its bus 
transportation for extra-curricular activities which require distance 
travel; many other high schools nationwide have experienced similar 
cutbacks.  Is it morally right to deprive students of after school 
activities, thus increasing the likelihood that they will end up 
unsupervised and getting into trouble?  Can we justify spending $1.1 
billion in military aid to Colombia rather than funding buses for high 
school sports teams and bands?

<p>As tax day draws nigh, we as Americans are challenged to examine our lives, 
our budgets, our bank account balances and our priorities.  We have power 
through deliberate acts of conscience to challenge the IRS to appropriate a 
portion of our money to a peace tax fund.  We can ask Congress to fund a 
cabinet-level Presidential advisory Department of Peace.  Our paycheck is 
our power and our voice.  How should our money be spent?

<p>We decide.

<p><i>An admirer of Henry David Thoreau, Leah C. Wells advocates peaceful 
applications of tax dollars toward increasing teachers' salaries, funding 
to after school programs, college scholarships and social services.  She
