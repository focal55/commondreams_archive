<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Trent Lott is under fire for suggesting, 
  at a birthday bash for his mentor Strom Thurmond, that America would have been 
  better off had Thurmond's 1948 Dixiecrat campaign for the presidency been victorious. 
  Lott's comments have been met with the typical round of sanctimonious and self-righteous 
  posturing from establishment pundits and hypocritical politicians--Democrat 
  and Republican--expressing dismay at the Senator's insensitivity and shock at 
  how anyone today could find anything appealing about Thurmond's segregationist 
  campaign of 1948.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sanctimonious posturing got me to thinking: 
  what if Thurmond <i><b>had </b></i>won in 1948? What kinds of policies might 
  have been followed by the federal government since that time? <b>Maybe the following?:</b></font></p>
<ul>
  
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>During the late 1940s and into the mid 1950s</b>, the Federal Government 
    would have ruined scores of lives and reputations in the name of fighting 
    communist infiltration of America's sacred institutions. An &quot;Un-American 
    Activities Committee&quot; would have been formed to try suspected traitors 
    in public. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The FBI's J. Edgar Hoover would have been allowed to ride roughshod over 
    the Constitution</b>, also in the name of fighting communism. In the 1970s 
    it would have been revealed that Hoover's &quot;Counterintelligence Program&quot; 
    (COINTELPRO), designed &quot;to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or 
    otherwise neutralize&quot; those the Bureau considered &quot;enemies of the 
    State,&quot; frequently targeted innocent citizens whose only crime was to 
    demand the right to vote or to have a seat at a lunch counter.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy</b> all would 
    have been assassinated at the high point of the Civil Rights Movement. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>By 2001 Human Rights Groups would report</b> that 111 nations have abolished 
    the death penalty completely in law or in practice. Yet in that same same 
    year Amnesty International would report that 90 per cent of all known executions 
    took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia <b>and the USA</b>. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In 1968 the Kerner Commission</b>, put in place by President Johnson 
    after the violent 1967 summer of race riots, would conclude that America had 
    become two nations, one White and one Black, separate and unequal. In 1998 
    the Kerner Commission would reconvene and conclude that the problems found 
    in 1968 had in many ways become worse. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Vietnam War</b> would be fought disproportionately by children of 
    the lower middle class and poor. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments</b>, started in 1932 and involving 
    the federal government's intentional use of black men as guinea pigs, would 
    continue on until 1972. The government would not apologize for the experiments 
    until 1997. In 1993 it would be revealed that during the Cold War government 
    sanctioned experimenters had fed &quot;radioactive oatmeal&quot; to mentally 
    retarded children in Massachusetts and commited a host of other atrocities. 
  </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The government would have spent trillions of dollars</b> building the 
    National Security State from 1948-1990, at the same time lamenting the growth 
    of &quot;entitlement&quot; spending for the population at large.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>As a result of federal laws</b>, union organizing would have been made 
    more difficult. By 2003 only about 15% of the private sector workforce would 
    be unionized.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Aid to Familes With Dependent Children</b> (AFDC), the New Deal commitment 
    to the poor, would have been repealed. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In the name of smaller government</b>, a &quot;deregulation&quot; era 
    would have begun and culminate in taxpayers bailing out the Savings and Loan 
    Industry. Gradual weakening of supposed corporate watchdogs like the Securities 
    and Exchange Commission would have led to a situation in which Enron, WorldComm, 
    and others could cavalierly cook their books for years while the Congress 
    in a bipartisan way took their cash and looked the other way as pensions were 
    squandered and CEOs gave themselves golden parachutes. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>By the late 1990s it would be revealed</b> that the U.S. incarcerated 
    a greater proportion of its population than any countries except Russia and 
    Rwanda. By the year 2002 we'd have almost 2 million people in prison or jail, 
    reflecting an incareration rate of about 650 per 100,000 residents, double 
    the rate of 10 years before. Human rights organizations would show that approximately 
    one in every 117 males in the United States was in prison. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The federal government's suggestion</b> as to what to do about contuing 
    racism in America would be to have a &quot;dialogue&quot; on it.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>By the year 2000</b>, the percentage of black elected officials among 
    all elected officials would be only 1.7 percent.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>College campuses like the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh</b> would 
    have had more African American students in 1968 (114 enrolled) than they do 
    in 2002 (99 enrolled). </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Much of America by 2003 would remain stubbornly resistant to racial integration</b>. 
    In 2001 the Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative Urban and Regional Research 
    at the State University of New York in Albany would analyze the 2000 census 
    and conclude that &quot;the average white person in metropolitan America lives 
    in a neighborhood that is 80% white and only 7% black.&quot; A &quot;typical 
    black individual,&quot; they would find, &quot;lives in a neighborhood that 
    is only 33% white and as much as 51% black. Residential segregation remains 
    high in cities and suburbs around the country.&quot; </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So to Trent Lott, sanctimonious pundits, and hypocritical politicians: what 
  exactly is it that Strom Thurmond would have done in 1948 that did not actually 
  happen in America since then? The evidence presented above suggests to me that 
  we have surely had a Thurmondification of politics since 1948. Yes, we have 
  had a <i><b>Lott </b></i>of that, aided and abetted every step of the way by 
  some of the Senator's most vocal critics.</font></p>
