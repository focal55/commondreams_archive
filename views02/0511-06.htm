<p>It is often observed that people are better off leaving the topics of 
religion and politics alone.  As Mark Twain notes:  “...In matters 
concerning religion and politics a man’s reasoning powers are not above the 
monkey’s.”  But it is difficult to resist making a monkey of oneself.  For 
what a year it has been, with people flying airplanes into crowded buildings 
in the name of religion, and people dropping bombs on one of the poorest 
countries on earth in the name of politics!  A year of young people blowing 
themselves (and as many fellow human beings as they can take with them) to 
bits, and of tanks creating chaos and destruction and terror in the name of 
eliminating   chaos and destruction and terror.  Some year!  When Ariel 
Sharon is called a man of peace and Iran is said to belong to an axis of 
evil, you know you’re having a bad one.  And you wonder if the Mark Twain 
quote just cited might not in fact constitute an insult to the monkey.

<p>To speak of peace in this ‘Year of the Monkey’ may seem absurd.  Proponents 
of the “war on terror” appear to regard peace as an irrelevant, annoying, 
obsolete, and even unpatriotic proposition.  “Of course we too want peace,” 
they say, “but only 50 or 60 years from now when the last vestige of Evil 
has been bombed off the face of the planet.”  Good luck.  Let’s hope there’s 
a planet left by the time you’re through.  (Chances seem pretty good there 
will still be some Evil around.)

<p>The governments marketing this war on terror would like us to believe that 
it is particularly pure and just.  (After all, what could be wrong with 
fighting terror?)  Of course this type of sales pitch has been tried a 
couple of times before, and the world is still waiting for a pure and just 
war.  What Gandhi said is more credible:  “I object to violence because when 
it appears to do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is 
permanent.”  Alas, in the ‘Year of the Monkey’, the words of George W. Bush 
receive far more notice than those of Mohandas K. Gandhi, or of Albert 
Einstein, who wrote:  “Peace cannot be kept by force.  It can only be 
achieved through understanding."

<p>Is government primarily dedicated to promoting peace or to creating 
obstacles to it?  The question isn’t new.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
famously observed:  “I like to believe that people in the long run are going 
to do more to promote peace than our governments.  Indeed, I think that 
people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get 
out of the way and let them have it.”  We need to demand that government be 
more accountable.  If government can demonstrate itself to be at least as 
good at peace as it is at war, it might get more trust and respect.  That 
said, we must resist the temptation to put the responsibility for peace 
solely on government.  As Jawaharlal Nehru remarked:  “Peace is not merely 
the absence of war.  It is also a state of mind.  Lasting peace can come 
only to peaceful people.”  The peace is best that starts at home.  “First 
keep the peace within yourself,” said Thomas a Kempis; “then you can also 
bring peace to others.”

<p>In the end, we cannot go around calling for peace and expect much to happen. 
  If only it were that simple.  “Many men cry Peace! Peace! But they refuse 
to do the things that make for peace,” says Martin Luther King.  What are 
the things that make for peace? Justice?  Freedom?  Yes, but how often these 
become mere words thrown away in the never-ending process of getting even 
and the lopsided demands of "the national interest".   The war on terror, 
the suicide bombings, Israel’s outrage against Jenin, the attacks on (and 
by) Hindus, Moslems, and Christians in India?  Do they really go anywhere in 
doing “the things that make for peace”?  Or are they just about getting 
even?

<p>In any case, we are quick to condemn the violence of others, equally quick 
to justify our own.  In the ‘Year of the Monkey’, not a day has gone by in 
which violence (whether Israeli, Palestinian, American, or Al-Qaedan) has 
not been justified and glorified by some, even as it is being condemned and 
scorned by others.  If we ever make it to the ‘Year of the Human Being’, it 
will be because we have realized that an honest war on injustice will do 
more to fight terror than a billion tons of bombs or a million years of 
getting even.  Desmond Tutu recently referred to peace as “God’s dream”.  
Why must we insist on living in our own nightmares?
