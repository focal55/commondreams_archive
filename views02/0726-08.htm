<p>Since the early months of 2000, the Nasdaq has fallen about 75 percent, the 
broader S.&P. 500 more than 40 percent. These aren't mere paper losses; they translate 
into disappointment and even hardship for millions of Americans. Now more than 
ever we need institutions that provide a safety net for the middle class.</p>
<p> Yet George W. Bush still wants to party like it's 1999. On Wednesday he insisted 
that he continued to favor partially privatizing Social Security.</p>
<p> Bear in mind that ordinary Americans are already more vulnerable to stock 
market fluctuations than ever before. Twenty years ago most workers had "defined 
benefit" pension plans: their employers promised them a certain amount per year. 
During the long bull market, however, such plans were largely replaced with 401(k)'s 
— "defined contribution" plans whose payoff depends on the market. This sounded 
great when stocks were rising. But now many will find either that they can't retire, 
or that they will have to get by with much less than they expected. For some, 
Social Security will be all that's left.</p>
<p> Mr. Bush first proposed privatizing Social Security back when people still 
believed that stocks only go up. Even then his proposal made no sense; as I've 
explained before, it was based on the claim that 2-1=4, that you can divert the 
payroll taxes of younger workers into personal accounts and still pay promised 
benefits to older workers. But now even the nonsensical promise that individual 
accounts would earn stock market returns looks pretty unappealing. So why does 
he keep pushing the idea? </p>
<p> One reason is ideology: hard-line conservatives are determined to build a 
bridge back to the 1920's. Another is Mr. Bush's infallibility complex: to back 
off on privatization would be to admit, at least implicitly, to a mistake — and 
this administration never, ever does that. </p>
<p> But there may be a third reason. Ask yourself: Who would benefit directly 
from the creation of "personal accounts" under Social Security?</p>
<p> Those personal accounts won't be like personal stock portfolios. The Social 
Security Administration can't and won't become a stockbroker for 130 million clients, 
most of them with quite small accounts. Instead it's likely that a privatization 
scheme would require individuals to invest with one of a handful of designated 
private investment funds.</p>
<p> That would mean enormous commissions for the managers of those funds. And 
those who would be likely to benefit showed their appreciation, in advance: During 
the 2000 election, according to opensecrets.org, campaign contributors in the 
two categories labeled "securities and investment" and "miscellaneous finance" 
(basically individual wheeler-dealers) gave Mr. Bush almost six times as much 
as they gave Al Gore.</p>
<p> Here, too, Mr. Bush's past is prologue. I reported in an earlier column the 
story of Utimco, the University of Texas fund that, while Mr. Bush was governor 
and the current secretary of commerce, Donald Evans, headed the U.T. regents, 
placed more than $1 billion with private funds, many with close business or political 
ties to Mr. Bush himself. Among the beneficiaries were the Wyly brothers, who 
later financed a crucial smear campaign against John McCain. ("Bush reveals his 
poisonous colors" was the headline of a piece about that campaign, written by 
the online pundit Andrew Sullivan.)</p>
<p> Could America's retirement savings really be used to reward the administration's 
friends? Ask the teachers of Texas. In one of many odd deals during Mr. Bush's 
time as governor, the Texas teachers' retirement system sold several buildings 
without open bids, taking a $70 million loss, to a company controlled by Richard 
Rainwater, a prime mover behind Mr. Bush's rise to wealth. </p>
<P> In an Aug. 16, 1998, article in The Houston Chronicle — which should be required 
reading for anyone trying to understand the Bush administration — the reporter, 
R. G. Ratcliffe, matter-of-factly summarized this and many other unusual deals 
thus: "A pattern emerges: When a Bush is in power, Bush's business associates 
benefit." </p>
<P> Of course, personal Social Security accounts would have to be managed by nationally 
reputable institutions. Mr. Bush couldn't give the business to his old Texas cronies 
— could he?</p>
<P> When a politician won't let go of a proposal that, by any normal calculation, 
should be completely off the table, you have to wonder.</p>
