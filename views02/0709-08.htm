<p>I THOUGHT I DIDN'T really have to care about the plan to stash nuclear waste 
in Yucca Mountain. I mean, the place is all the way in Nevada, which might as 
well be Mars as far as most of us here in Virginia are concerned.</p>
<p>Then I found out some of the North Anna plant's Nevada-bound waste would be 
transported by rail through downtown Fredericksburg, a half-mile from where I 
work and less than a mile from where I live. </p>
<p>Suddenly, Yucca Mountain became a hot issue for me.</p>
<p>And it should be for lots of other people, too, because if the Senate approves 
the Bush administration's proposal for the Nevada site later this week, tens of 
millions of Americans--including nearly 600,000 Virginians--will be in my shoes: 
They'll be living or working within a mile of a possible nuclear-waste transport 
route. (To find out whether you live or work near a proposed route, visit <a href="http://www.mapscience.org" target="_new">www.mapscience.org</a>.)</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the government hasn't demonstrated much concern over how to ship 
radioactive waste to a remote part of Nevada. "What I find most shocking about 
the Yucca Mountain project is that [the Department of Energy] has no plan to transport 
spent nuclear fuel to its proposed repository," Jim Hall, former chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board, testified before Congress on May 23.</p>
<p>In fact, DOE is at least a year away from coming up with any detailed plan 
on how the waste shipments will get to Yucca Mountain, or how population centers 
along the routes might be affected, the Associated Press reports. </p>
<p>The Navy and a handful of utilities now ship about 60 loads of highly radioactive 
waste across short distances each year, according to the AP. But those shipments--dubbed 
"mobile Chernobyls" by critics of the Yucca Mountain project--would climb dramatically 
under the Bush plan, which would be implemented in 2010. </p>
<p>The Environmental Working Group says that some 619 radioactive shipments would 
cross Virginia alone over the 38-year life span of the project if the waste is 
moved mostly by rail; more than 7,000 shipments would traverse the state if the 
waste is shipped mostly by truck. </p>
<p>Since dozens of nuclear power plants cannot ship directly by rail, a combination 
truck-rail solution would be likely (with some barge shipments thrown in for good 
measure). The upshot would be tens of thousands of nuke shipments across our country 
in the coming decades. </p>
<p>(Fun fact: The U.S. Public Interest Research Group reports that folks stuck 
in a traffic jam for an hour next to one of these nuclearwaste-transporting trucks 
could receive a radiation dose the equivalent of a chest X-ray--something generally 
not advised for children and pregnant women.)</p>
<p>In addition, the Yucca Mountain project would make shipping distances for nuclear 
waste far greater than they are now, since most of the waste would have to be 
sent from east of the Mississippi to the Nevada site. U.S. PIRG estimates that 
the average shipping distance would be over 2,000 miles.</p>
<p>DOE has expressed full confidence in the shipment casks designed to carry the 
waste, but tests by the government's Sandia National Laboratory have concluded 
that the containers could be penetrated by a missile or other high-energy weapon. 
And DOE has admitted that last year's rail-tunnel fire in Baltimore would have 
caused the release of radioactive material had one of the nuclear-waste casks 
been involved.</p>
<p>There are conflicting assessments of the number of people who would die if 
one of those casks did sustain a serious leak. DOE's worst-case scenario predicts 
48 radiation-related deaths in a terrorist incident and five such deaths in a 
severe truck accident. But the Environmental Working Group cites experts who estimate 
thousands of deaths over time if a radiation release occurred in an urban area. 
</p>
<p>Proponents of the Yucca Mountain project argue we'd enjoy greatly increased 
security from having our nuclear waste stored in a central facility. But even 
after the shipments to Yucca Mountain ended, in 2048, there still would be nearly 
the same amount of nuclear waste at power plants as there is today, the Environmental 
Working Group says. Virginia, for example, now has 1,732 metric tons of nuclear 
waste; that figure would fall only to 1,266 metric tons after Yucca Mountain was 
filled. </p>
<p>Since Sept. 11, the authorities have been assuring us that our nuclear waste 
now is stored in safe, secure sites. If that's the case, why is the Bush administration 
in such a rush to force the Yucca Mountain plan through Congress, especially when 
it hasn't ironed out the transportation details? Hall, the former NTSB chief, 
believes "they're trying to slip this through before [the transportation questions] 
are focused on by the American people."</p>
<p>He might be right. In any event, there are too many unanswered questions about 
the Yucca Mountain project for it to go forward at this time. The Senate must 
do the responsible thing this week and shelve the plan until DOE has done all 
of its homework.</p>
