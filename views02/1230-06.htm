<p>The new year approaches. I am finishing my second week
in Baghdad as a member of the <a href="http://iraqpeaceteam.org/" target="_new">Iraq Peace Team</a>, an international, non-governmental group of peace activists.  Our mission is simple: to be with the people of Iraq no matter what comes to pass in the weeks and months ahead. In my hotel one of the managers keeps a monkey. The monkey's name is Coffee. He is still quite young. His home is a cage that is moved at various times during the day from the reception area to a corner by the window. I have seen Coffee's owner holding him and feeding him formula from a dropper. The man is not unkind and seems to have won Coffee's trust and affection. When the monkey has drunk his fill, he gently pushes the dropper away with his deft little hands.
<p>If a stranger, hoping to attract Coffee's attention,
puts his fingers a tad too close to the cage, Coffee
will instantly dart his arm between the bars and
attempt to nab the intruder. Then, infuriated perhaps
or just frustrated by his repeated failures, Coffee
will bite his own feet and hands, or seize the wooden
slats of his seat and shake them with all the might
his heart can command.
<p>When I first met Coffee, he had nothing inside his
cage other than a container for water and two seats
for sitting on or sleeping. No toys, no blankets, no
food, and of course no companions. No room in which to
swing, to hang upside down if that is what he so
desired, to leap about in monkey-mad delirium and
delight. Coffee's environment could not have been more
stark, more lacking in all the things a living,
sentient being needs in order not merely to survive
but to flourish.
<p>With the owner's permission, I gave Coffee a small,
brown teddy bear. One week has passed since then and
still he has not destroyed the bear. I have seen him
holding it with the utmost gentleness or playing with
it as if it were indeed a companion of sorts, one he
would never want to lose or willingly hurt.
<p>Something about this little monkey's life has touched
me. I want him to stop hurting himself. I want him to
have all the things to which he is entitled. I want to
rip open his cage with my bare hands and set him free.
But I am not in Baghdad to sympathize with the plight
of captive primates.  I am here to stand with the
people of Iraq as they continue to struggle with the
effects of sanctions and now face the threat of
cataclysmic war. 
<p>Oddly enough, the plight of Coffee in a cage leads me
to the plight of children in Iraq, one of the richest
countries in the world. Despite its vast oil
resources, Iraq has declined from material prosperity
to third-world poverty. UN comprehensive economic
sanctions, in force since 1990, are primarily
responsible for this decline. One significant
indicator of Iraq's overall economic health is its
infant mortality rate. A UNICEF report published in
2001 noted that over the past decade the infant
mortality rate in Iraq has increased by 160%. This
increase is the highest among all the countries
surveyed in the 2001 report. 
<p>For the poor children of Iraq, even the essentials of
life are too often lacking, to say nothing of toys and
teddy bears. Over their lives, we in the West have
placed a cage. We allow these children to have just
what they need to survive but no more. We decide what
goes between the bars and into their barren hands. 
<p>In the public hospitals of Iraq, despite the benefits
derived from the Oil for Food program, doctors
continue to struggle with life-threatening shortages
of drugs and equipment. In Basrah, shortly before
Christmas, two fellow members of the Iraq Peace Team
visited the pediatric wards of the city's major
hospital. There they witnessed the death of a
six-year-old girl from leukemia. The drugs she needed
were not available. Not available in one of the
richest countries on earth. Not available because the
entire sanctions regime, imposed by the UN but
maintained and enforced by the United States and Great
Britain, severely restricts what Iraq can and cannot
import. 
<p>At Baghdad University, I had an opportunity to meet
with students and to visit the library for the
Department of English. Undergraduate and graduate
students alike are eager to pursue their studies and
master their particular disciplines, whether the 19th
century British novel or plays by contemporary
writers. But the books they need, works of modern
scholarship, are largely not available. There are 10
computers on one server for over 200 students.
Internet access is slow and unreliable due to frequent
power failures. In the one-room library most of the
texts are from the seventies. Many are much, much
older. Bookcases lean precariously under the weight of
moldy, forgotten volumes. 
<p>The books are unavailable because someone in New York
or Washington, adhering to official sanctions
guidelines, has declared them to be non-essential. Non-essential to a people who thrive on learning and literature, who gave the world the written word and the myth of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest stories humanity possesses. 
<p>Coffee the monkey may be satisfied, at least
temporarily, with a teddy bear. But what of the
children and young people of Iraq. If they are to
achieve the full measure of their humanity and become responsible, caring citizens not only of their own country but indeed of the world, then the cage that confines them must be removed. It is not enough to give them only government food rations purchased through oil revenues. It is not enough to allow them to have only  some of the medicine they need, or to provide them with internet access but deny them books.


<p>Far from removing the cage or granting the children of
Iraq the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, the West, in particular the United States
and Great Britain, is now moving its weapons into
place and preparing to launch a massive assault that
will no doubt kill thousands of innocent Iraqi
children, lay waste to their cities and towns, pollute
their rivers and streams, destroy their homes and any possibility they might have had for a secure future. 

<p>It is not too late to prevent this from happening. To
believe otherwise is almost more than I can bear,
especially when I hold in my arms the children of
families I have grown to love through my years of
coming here. I give them little presents from home. I
take them to their favorite places. But now, as the
bombers are prepared, the only gift that has any
meaning is the blessing of life. Life in its fullest,
deepest, wildest being. Life and nothing less. Life
forever more.
