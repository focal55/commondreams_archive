<p>President Bush just signed the Iraqi resolution plan for a preemptive and unilateral 
attack on that country, but that probably won’t improve the souring U.S. job market. 
Progressives, take note. 
<p>Currently, the administration is bringing its full weight to bear on the U.N. 
Security Council to legitimate U.S. military action against Iraq. Meanwhile, the 
number of people out of work in September was basically the same as it was in 
August, according to the Labor Department. 
<p>As the Bush administration backs an Iraqi war ever more, how do progressives 
connect national security and the economic insecurity of the U.S. public? This 
isn’t an academic question. 
<p>We know the official vision of national security and economic security. What 
is ours? 
<p>How can we connect U.S. policies designed to conquer foreign resources such 
as Persian Gulf oil and the festering jobs crisis here? What are some ways to 
link war with Iraq to people in the U.S. facing economic insecurity? 
<p>For example, protecting the U.S. public against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
doesn’t change the fact that the economic slowdown is forcing businesses to hold 
back on hiring. When the growth of profits slows, the hiring of workers slows. 
<p>This is the harsh reality of a harsh system. It’s cut from the cloth of militarism, 
racism and sexism. 
<p>On that note, standing up to Evil in Iraq doesn’t change the fiscal crises 
of local and state governments increasingly strapped for cash to meet people's 
material needs. Likewise, the White House’s resolve to bring its vision of democracy 
to Iraq doesn’t bring back Enron and WorldCom workers' pensions invested in the 
stock market. 
<p>Even those in the corporate suites are fretting about the current business 
climate. This is an admission that a U.S. attack on Iraq doesn’t automatically 
equate to a rising tide of national security that lifts all boats, or planes, 
in this case. 
<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 8, executives with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines told 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that the nation’s big airlines are in bad financial 
shape. Some carriers are perhaps facing extinction, they added. 
<p>Thus many thousands of workers stand to lose their livelihoods. According to 
AMR Corp. CEO Donald Carty, federal aid is urgently needed to help U.S airlines 
cover rising security and insurance expenses, which could be hype or just a PR 
ploy for taxpayer dollars. 
<p>Meanwhile, as sectors of corporate America lobby Washington for a hand and 
the Bush administration’s war lobby presses the U.N. Security Council, people 
in the U.S. go to and look for work. This keeps them, the capitalist system and 
the military force that supports it abroad moving forward. 
<p>This is a contradiction. In my view, such contradictions should be addressed 
by progressives with the aim to expand our choir of committed activists. 
<p>I mean, we want peace, but what does that mean under a system of commodity 
production that regularly intervenes militarily to make the world safe for U.S. 
corporations? We have to think about new ways to speak with the U.S. public about 
this contradiction. 
<p>What is our vision of a civilized society based on social cooperation, not 
the private competition of all against all and each against all? How should peace 
activists encourage the U.S. public to consider capitalism and its wars, national 
security and economic insecurity? 
<p>In my view, this is a question that must be asked of and answered by ordinary 
people to create a future of peace and prosperity. </p>
