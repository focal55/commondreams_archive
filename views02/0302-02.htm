One of the world's biggest advertising agencies has declared that "brands are the new religion". It is a familiar argument to say that we live in an ad-drenched society, in which logos are everywhere - from the inside of lavatory cubicles to the labels attached to oranges. But a new advertising strategy is being adopted in order to win customer loyalty, the tapping of religious yearning. 
<P>"Everyone needs something to believe in," a recent advertisement for a car reminded us. The words were followed by a close-up of a shamrock, a traditional lucky charm, a close-up of a cross, now a popular fashion accessory, and the twirly metal design that identifies the brand of car, a vehicle that you cannot only rely on but believe in. Never mind controversial logos projected on to the dome of St Paul's cathedral to give them some spiritual added value, now the logo replaces St Paul as the religious icon.  
<P>There are many alternatives to God in a post-Christian society - sport, nationalism, astrology, new religious movements - which is not to say that many people have not been able to do without any sort of religion, traditional or alternative. Nevertheless, advertising agencies have   spotted a new way of marketing their products: sell them as if they can fill the void in a faithless world; make brands their icons, inviting the faithful to devote themselves to the new religion by buying, the final act of commitment through which the unbeliever is converted.  
<P>It is a traditional complaint of the churches that consumerism has become a substitute for faith, that instead of thinking about things of ultimate significance, people have become immersed in material- ism, buying more and more half-needed goods. Now the implicit message is that the half-needed things are themselves the religious symbols that will give meaning to life.  
<P>Shopping is not a substitute for spirituality; shopping is itself a spiritual act. Along the shelves of huge indoor malls - the cathedrals of the 21st century - are things that satisfy not only material needs, but the spiritual hunger to which many people still admit. No adver tiser could mean anything other than the soul when offering to reach "the parts that other beers cannnot reach".  
<P>The obsession with branding might seem an odd area to look for signs of displaced religious desires. Surely a Nike swoosh is not a confused "Yes" to God? The McDonald's arches are not the portal of the local church. Yet the building of brands into visual slogans, supposedly capable of evoking a profound response, is a curious feature of modern society. What do people expect to get from that special soft drink?  
<P>Here in the Czech Republic, brand-bombing is only a decade old, and still provides a welcome alternative to the colourless communist past. But here, too, logos are everywhere, with promises that actually remind many people of communism. Utopia is still being promised, now through a drink or a smoke rather than Marxism.  

<P>People still want to believe all those promises for the future. Now that priests and politicians have failed them, the only satisfaction to our apparently insatiable spiritual yearnings comes from the manufacturers of shoes and soft drinks.
