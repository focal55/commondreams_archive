<p>IS GEORGE BUSH about to get lucky again?
<P>White House political adviser Karl Rove has positioned Bush as the champion 
of corporate reform, even though Bush's own history epitomized the kind of corruption 
that Enron and Global Crossing raised to new heights. Last week Congressional 
Republicans, long obstructionist on this issue, quickly reversed course, too. 
By the endgame the House Republican leadership - after proposing much weaker legislation 
- has embraced the reform bill proposed by Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes of 
Maryland and then some. And the financial markets helped with the biggest one-week 
rally since 1933. </P>
<P>So President Bush - Mr. Education, Mr. Drug Benefit - is now Mr. Corporate 
Reform. Is the latter any more believable than the former? This will depend on 
two factors - the economy and the Democrats.</P>
<P>At this writing, despite the market comeback, a lot of real damage has been 
done to the real economy by the same abuses that caused the market slide. And 
it is unlikely that the economy is headed back into a boom any time soon - certainly 
not before the November midterm elections. </P>
<P>However, despite their exemplary leadership on corporate reform, it is difficult 
for the Democrats to define the corporate scandals in purely partisan terms. Just 
enough Democrats were complicit in the financial and corporate deregulation of 
the 1980s and 1990s that caused the scandals. Nor can the shackling of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission be laid squarely at the feet of the Republicans. However, 
it is possible to pin the blame squarely on conservative ideology. So any partisan 
gains by the Democrats would need to be ideological gains - faulting the ideology 
of market worship whose main vehicle is the Republican Party.</P>
<P>The Sarbanes bill on corporate and accounting reform was only a modest first 
step. There are other kinds of abuses still at work. Yet as soon as Democratic 
progressives try to press for broader reform, they run into allies of corporate 
abuse right in their own party. Michigan Senator Carl Levin's efforts to compel 
stock options to be treated as ordinary expenses is Exhibit A. Democrats, as well 
as Republicans, have grown dependent on fat campaign contributions from the technology 
industry. The very week that both parties were outdoing each other to champion 
accounting reform, corporate lobbyists managed to isolate Levin and options reform.</P>
<P>The fact is, it's possible to reward corporate executives for performance in 
a variety of ways that neither compromise balance sheets nor invite manipulation 
the way options do. It is possible to base executive pay on performance so that 
bonuses vary with bona fide earnings or market share. It's also possible to compensate 
executives with ordinary grants of stock rather than options to purchase stock 
that have value only at a certain price. The fact that many Democrats have flinched 
from embracing even the Levin reforms suggests how compromised the party still 
is.</P>
<P>The other day Senator Joe Lieberman, looking for a way to wriggle out of his 
promise not to run for president against Al Gore, scolded Gore for abandoning 
the New Democrat faith by actually promising in the 2000 campaign to fight for 
those left behind by the late economic boom. That was about the only thing Gore 
did right. </P>
<P>Even at a time when the corporate sacking of the economy is demonstrating why 
ordinary people need both government and a progressive party that believes in 
government's necessary role, this New Democrat undertow will compromise Democrats' 
ability to seize the moment. Gore will contest Lieberman and the others based 
on a money primary in which fund-raising pays for polling and media and the actual 
voters are spectators. Democrats could well be whipsawed, as in previous elections, 
between wealthy donors and their apologists warning that ''growth'' (being soft 
on business abuse) rather than ''class warfare'' (championing the pocketbook interests 
of the nonrich) is the winning recipe for the party.</P>
<P>Despite this split, the corporate abuses and the peculiarly Republican odor 
emanating from them improve the Democrats' prospects both in this November's midterm 
elections and in 2004. But this is an opportunity that Democrats themselves can 
squander if they let their own corporate wing call the tune.</P>
<P>There also remains the issue of George W. Bush's own personal vulnerability 
(not to mention Vice President Cheney's). The Harken Energy abuses, like Cheney's 
reign at Halliburton, cry out for further investigation. They are certainly a 
far bigger deal, on the merits, than Whitewater. Whether they turn into serious 
political liabilities for the White House depends on whether the opposition party 
has the stomach to demand a full investigation. </P>
