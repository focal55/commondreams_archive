<p>NEW YORK -- It's hard to know whether to laugh or to cry at U.S. President 
George Bush's much-awaited "vision" of Mideast peace unveiled last week, a speech 
so obviously crafted by special interests and driven by domestic politics that 
the rest of the world winced in embarrassment. Even moderate Israeli leader Shimon 
Peres called it a "fatal mistake." 
<p>The view abroad was captured by veteran British journalist Robert Fisk, who 
acidly wrote that Israeli PM Ariel Sharon, who has made six visits to Bush's White 
House, should be allowed to run the White House press office, to "spare the American 
president the ignominy of parroting everything he is told by the Israelis." 
<p>Bush's message to Palestinians: basically, no state until you kick out Yasser 
Arafat, stop resisting Israeli occupation, develop true democracy, do what Israel 
tells you, create capitalism, eliminate corruption and stop causing trouble. Then, 
some day, the U.S. might consider an "interim" Palestinian state whose borders 
and sovereignty would be "provisional," provided Israel agrees. 
<p>Bush might as well have told Palestinians they won't get their freedom and 
homeland until they can recite the U.S. Tax Code in Apache. 
<p>Bush, a man untroubled by deep thought or irony, had the chutzpah, as we New 
Yorkers say, to urge Palestinians to adopt Scandinavian-style democracy, while 
telling them they cannot re-elect Arafat, who was elected in a fair vote by over 
80% of his people - rather better than President Bush, who slid into office thanks 
to court orders and voter exclusions in Florida. 
<p>As for corruption, Arafat's thieving PLO cronies look like the homeless compared 
to Bush's mega-crook pals at Enron who helped finance his elections. 
<p><B>Corrupt autocracies</B> 
<p>Why didn't Bush urge free elections on America's other Mideast clients - Egypt, 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and the Gulf states, mostly corrupt autocracies 
run by generals or feudal monarchs? What the president wants is an obedient Palestinian 
version of Afghanistan's new leader, CIA "asset" Hamid Karzai, who was put into 
power with U.S. and British bayonets and billions in bribes. 
<p>Bush politely suggested Israel stop building settlements. Considering that 
Sharon scorned Bush when the president ordered him to pull his U.S.-armed and 
financed troops out of the West Bank, there is zero chance Israel will stop gobbling 
it up. Sharon has made it perfectly clear by his actions that he will never withdraw 
from the West Bank or Golan, which Israel occupies illegally, and will never accept 
a viable Palestinian state. Worse, Sharon appears likely to be succeeded by rival 
Benjamin Netanyahu, who actually calls Sharon "soft" on Palestinians. 
<p>What Bush and Israel's rightists want is apartheid-style bantustans - tribal 
reservations policed by Palestinian kapos, surrounded by Israeli troops, covering 
about 40% of Palestine. Israel will get the rest. In fact, Israeli peace groups 
recently revealed there are now 400,000 Jewish settlers in the Occupied Territories 
and Golan, not the 200,000 previously believed. When the Oslo Accords were signed 
in 1993, there were 85,000 Jewish settlers. 
<p>Arafat's U.S.-financed Palestinian Authority and its security apparatus are 
dictatorial, thoroughly corrupt and abuse human rights. Arafat winks at terror 
attacks on Israeli civilians, is a liability to his people and should make way 
for new leadership. But so should Sharon and Israel's expansionists, who have 
plunged their nation into a bloody morass and provoked anti-Semitism around the 
globe. A pox on both houses. 
<p>Israel, at least, has moderate, capable alternative leaders like Peres and 
Yossi Beilin, who can bring some sanity to the political scene. The only real 
Palestinian candidate, Marawan Barghouti, is in an Israel prison. The PLO is totally 
discredited among Palestinians because of corruption and close co-operation with 
the U.S. and Israel. This leaves the extremist groups - Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
- as the choice of a majority of Palestinians. Bush's relentless undermining of 
Arafat's PLO has strengthened Palestinian radicals and played into the hands of 
Sharon, who vows he will never deal with "terrorists." 
<p>Israelis and their American supporters greeted Bush's speech with predictable 
adulation. Bush and his advisers hope to increase their share of the Jewish vote 
in November's critical U.S. mid-term elections from 19% to over 50%. Embracing 
Israel's far right also delighted ardent Bush supporters on the Christian far 
right. Many of these rustic fundamentalists believe that when all Jews are moved 
into Biblical Israel (including the West Bank), their Christian Messiah will return 
and destroy the world in Armageddon. Good Christians will then go to paradise. 
<p>President Bush's "vision" for Palestine is a myopic fantasy seen through rose-colored 
glasses supplied by his alter ego, Ariel Sharon. The plan is frightful news for 
Palestinians, bad news for Israelis seeking peace, and bad news for Americans. 
<p>Bush has put domestic politics and his re-election before America's proper 
national interests. He has undermined real peacemakers among the Israelis and 
Arabs. Worse, instead of playing honest peace broker in the Mideast, Bush's total 
identification with Israel's far right ensures America will again become the target 
of extremists from an increasingly enraged Muslim world - and of furious Palestinians 
who now have nothing to lose except the cruel mirage of a fraudulent "provisional 
interim" state. </p>
