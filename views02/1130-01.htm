<p>D-Day of December 8th quietly approaches - the day Iraq
must provide the UN Security Council with a complete
accounting of its weapons programs, plus its civilian chemical/biological/nuclear production and research activities. Even though UN weapons inspectors have criticized the December 8th deadline as unrealizable, the consequences for missing it will be catastrophic: Iraq will be in "material breach" of UN resolution 1441, and therefore subject to swift and decisive military action.

<p>But at this point, UN 1441 seems little more than a
whitewash pretext for a US-led attack on Iraq. With US warplanes patrolling Iraq's no-fly zone, bombing raids against Iraq ongoing, multiple aircraft carriers on alert and 60,000 US troops currently in or around the Persian Gulf, it's clear the war has already begun, "material breach" or not. When it's convenient for the Bush administration, Iraq will be found to have violated some aspect of the UN resolution, and the current buildup and covert military activity will explode into an all-out attack.

<p>The justification (that Iraq's Hussein violates
international law with his weapons of mass destruction
and is thus a menace to world peace) seems a bit ironic
in light of US actions in Iraq these past eleven years.

<p>Case in point. Article 54 of the Geneva Conventions clearly states that destroying 
or rendering useless items essential to the survival of civilian populations is 
illegal under international law and a war crime. Hard then to explain the 1991 
US bombing of electrical grids that powered 1,410 water-treatment plants for Iraq's 
22 million people. An excerpt from a 1998 <a href="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/pubs/speclist.asp?puborg=AFDC&series=dd" target="_new">US 
Air Force document</a>, entitled "Strategic Attack," chillingly explains: "The 
electrical attacks proved extremely effective ... The loss of electricity shut 
down the capital's water treatment plants and led to a public health crisis from 
raw sewage dumped in the Tigris River." A second US Defense Intelligence Agency 
document, 1991's "Iraq Water Treatment Vulnerabilities," predicted how sanctions 
would then be used to prevent Iraq from getting the equipment and chemicals necessary 
for water purification, which would result in "a shortage of pure drinking water 
for much of the population" leading to "increased incidences, if not epidemics, 
of disease." 
<p>So basically, in defiance of international law, the
United States knowingly destroyed Iraq's water supply,
then for the past eleven years has prevented the
contaminated drinking water from being treated, even
though it was obvious those most affected would be
millions of citizens doomed to preventable disease and
death. If that's not a material breach, what is?

<p>Then there's the depleted uranium (DU) weaponry the
United States and its allies used on Iraq during the
Gulf War, despite foreknowledge its radioactivity would
make food and water in the bombed regions unsafe for consumption on an indefinite basis (DU remains radioactive for 4.5 billion years). Add in the fact that trails of carcinogenic dust left in a DU bomb's wake spread in the wind to be absorbed by plants and animals, thereby devastating a region's food chain. Of course, humans inhale and absorb DU dust as well, which has most likely led not only to dramatically elevated levels of birth defects and cancer cases among Iraqi civilians, but also to a wide litany of suffering among Gulf War vets; a recent study, for example, found that even nine years after the war, veterans afflicted with Gulf War Syndrome ailments still had DU traces in their urine. This while there has yet to be any US governmental study on the effects of DU inhalation...

<p>We can expect DU to be used in the next attack on Iraq too, in spite of the 
inhumane risks to civilians and military personnel alike. According to a <a href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/" target="_new">Defense 
Department report</a>, "the US Military Services use DU munitions because of DU's 
superior lethality" adding, "Gulf War exposures to depleted uranium (DU) have 
not to date produced any observable adverse health effects attributable to DU's 
chemical toxicity or low-level radiation." With more than one out of six American 
Gulf War vets having <a href="http://www.ngwrc.org/shg/page2.html" target="_new">reported 
health problems</a> since their service, and over 9,000 having died since the 
war ended, not to mention the marked increase in Iraqi birth defects and cancer 
cases in DU-bombed regions, denial like that is nothing short of material breach, 
an affront to both human rights and common sense. 
<p>And what if the December 8th deadline is met, and no weapons of mass destruction 
are found by U.N. weapons inspectors inside Iraq? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/15/rumsfeld.iraq/index.html" target="_new">Says</a> 
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld: "What it would prove would be that the inspection 
process had been successfully defeated by the Iraqis. There's no question but 
that the Iraqi regime is clever, they've spent a lot of time hiding things, dispersing 
things, tunneling underground." So it would appear regardless of how the inspections 
turn out, the Iraqis will be attacked anyway. 
<p>In facing a no-win situation, Hussein could seem like a
martyr to others in the region; he could also see
little option but to unleash whatever destructive
powers he has left. Backing someone like him into a
corner is foreign policy at its most disastrous, a
dangerous development for the entire region and very
bad news for the unfortunate service men and women
thrown into that quagmire.

<p>It's clear that Saddam Hussein is a loathsome ogre who has shown criminal disregard 
for his population. What's also clear though is that the US record in the region 
is disgraceful if not downright criminal. Consider that for the two years following 
Hussein's infamous 1988 gas attack on the Kurds at Halabja (an attack in which 
US-built helicopters were <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0802-01.htm">apparently 
among those dropping the bombs</a>) the US government seemed quite uninterested 
in his possession of chemical weapons, or any other weapons for that matter. Remember 
too, that a 1992 Senate committee report entitled "US Chemical and Biological 
Warfare-Related Dual-Use Exports to Iraq," demonstrated that Hussein bought technology 
and materials necessary to create nuclear, biological and chemical weapons from 
none other than the States and Britain - and continued to make purchases even 
after the attack at Halabja. Factor in the water supply degradation, DU toxicity 
and debilitating sanctions and it's hard to imagine the average Iraqi embracing 
American forces as welcome liberators. 
<p>The bottom line is that the US has some questions to
answer about its past conduct in Iraq, questions that
can't be answered by another full-scale war.
