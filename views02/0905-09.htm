<p>On the surface, the anti-Iraq attack demonstration in front of Senator John Kerry’s office last Friday was a success.  
<p> A well-focused crowd of all different ages, numbering about 80 lined up along 
Cambridge Street and stoically held up colorful signs, while inside a delegation 
of 10 citizens chosen by the event’s planners, the <a href="http://www.MoveOn.org" target="_new">MoveOn</a> 
organization, met with one of the senator’s functionaries. <i>The <a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines02/0831-07.htm">Boston 
Globe</a></i><a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines02/0831-07.htm"> actually 
covered</a> the event. It was great progress for the cyberspace-based movement, 
which had initially grown from out of the outrage over the Clinton impeachment 
situation. On Wednesday (when the Kerry meeting was originally scheduled) the 
organization was responsible for having 150-plus protesters show up at Senator 
Kennedy’s office and over 100,000 turned out at various congressional offices 
nationwide. There was a rousing feeling at the gathering in front of Kerry’s office 
that here was a potential to effect some real change.
<p>
Forgive me, however, for feeling ultimately, strangely unfulfilled, like the sort of gastric afterglow you get from eating a McDonalds’ meal.<p>
The disappointment set in as soon as the 10 delegates emerged and took turns standing on a park bench calling out the results of the meeting to the gathered crowd.  <p>
“He’s on our side, he voted against the first Gulf War," insisted one.  <p>
“He understands oil politics; believes in a multilateral solution," said another.  <p>
Someone asked whether Kerry was planning a more aggressive leadership role on the issue.<p>
“He said we should pay attention because C-SPAN will start to be much more interesting after the break," a delegate answered, eliciting hearty laughs all around.<p>
There it was.  The good-natured whitewash.<p>
I looked over the handout that the Senator’s aide had copied for public consumption.  It was a column from the <i>Herald</i> in which Kerry gives his very best “No more Vietnams" rationale against the war, saying: “you do not start these [wars] without the guaranteed support and commitment of the American people."  He goes on to say we have to resume inspections or wait for Saddam to refuse them.  This, he believes, would justify going to war.<p>
Wrong answer.<p>
If Senator Kerry really believes that there is <i>any</i> reason short of Saddam launching a blitkrieg against Tel Aviv to justify a strike at a sovereign, sanctions-torn nation (no matter how unsavory their political infrastructure and potential future threat), then the Senator has already handed the ball to the man who is currently quite possibly one of the most dangerous human beings on the planet, our very own W.   No one is actually saying Hussein currently has a “Weapons Of Mass Destruction" arsenal.  If he did, the only reason he would have to use it right now would be to defend himself against the US.  Dick Cheney has already said that “regime change" will happen whether there are inspections or not.<p>
Here is what I’d like to say to Senator Kerry:<p>
This is a sucker play, Senator.  The Bush administration needs a war to deflect attention; the Al Qaeda hunt isn’t going so well, not to mention the tailspinning economy, creeping corporate scandals, the environment, etc.  By not coming out unconditionally against this idiocy, you are helping to facilitate it.<p>
Senator, if you are waiting for the Bushies to trip themselves up, it won’t happen. They will go through the motions of democracy; they’ll get their public-pleasing debate and Colin Powell will get his inspections attempt.  Then they will go to war.  <p>
And if you think that they are emboldened and hubristic now, watch out.  If they are able to scoop Iraq’s valuable oil fields, the Chickenhawks whispering in Bush’s ear will likely go for Saudi Arabia next.  Why not?  Who is going to stop them?  The world economy will probably be nosediving, but don’t underestimate the power of fear and paranoia.  They’ll certainly find evidence of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, if Iraq doesn’t go the way they expect, they will have thrown a stink bomb right into the center of the already volatile Middle East.  It could all easily result in another attack on American soil, providing even more momentum to the Bush juggernaut. <p>
This is not foreign policy they are pushing, Senator; this is pure hegemony.<p>
The GOP will beat the patriotic drums and stand united behind the fiasco.  And you and the other cowed democrats will be painted as timid, petty and unpatriotic when you say, “Well, we actually really thought the whole thing was a pretty bad idea from the beginning".<p>
Senator, your message to the crowd was that we had to give you a groundswell of public opinion.  Fair enough, MoveOn.org and many other organizations are working themselves to the bone, helping to do the vital job of getting this happening.<p>
But it is time to show some grit, determination and leadership.  You’ve been there.  You have the moral authority, unlike the chickenhawks pushing for war.  <p>
Forget about the polls, Senator Kerry. This goes beyond balancing yourself to stay on the most effective side of public opinion.  Forget about the general belief within the DLC that voters are not interested in foreign policy. This could be the singular concern that brings the country together; an issue that could spark your own run for presidency.  Nothing less than our future and the future of our world is at stake.  We need true leaders like never before.<p>
Don’t blow it.  </i></p>
