<p>TODAY, in dozens of cities and towns across the United States, 
something remarkable happened: Thousands of people battling cancer, AIDS and 
other terrible illnesses, their families, friends and supporters delivered 
cease-and-desist orders to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to stop 
it from blocking their access to a needed medication.
<P>Their request was so simple, so obviously correct that it is heartbreaking 
that people -- many very seriously ill -- were forced to deliver their message 
in this way, with many risking arrest. But as individuals who have found that 
medical marijuana relieves their symptoms when conventional medicines fail, 
they felt they had no choice: The federal government continues to fight an 
irrational war against medical marijuana, and the sick and struggling are its 
principal victims.
<P>Make no mistake: The government's demonization of marijuana is irrational. 
When I first published a study in the journal, Science, on marijuana's 
physical and psychological effects back in 1968, I was certain that medical 
use of the plant would be legal within five years. This is, after all, a 
medicinal plant for which no fatal dose has ever been established and that has 
been used in folk medicine for millennia.
<P>Like all medicines, marijuana has its drawbacks, particularly in smoked 
form. It is not a panacea. I support research into safer delivery systems such 
as low-temperature vaporizers or inhalers, which offer the fast action of 
inhaled medicine without the irritants found in smoke. Still, I have seen in 
my own studies that marijuana is less toxic than most pharmaceutical drugs in 
current use, and is certainly helpful for some patients, including those with 
wasting syndromes, chronic muscle spasticity and intractable nausea.
<P>Unfortunately, the only legal substitute available now -- a prescription 
pill containing a synthetic THC, marijuana's main psychoactive component -- is 
not EFFECTIVE enough for many patients. I hear regularly from patients that 
the pill does not work as well as the natural herb, and causes much greater 
intoxication.
<P>I am far from alone in this view. The Institute of Medicine, in a report 
commissioned by the White House "drug czar," concluded in 1999 that there is 
convincing evidence of marijuana's value in relieving nausea, weight loss, and 
other symptoms caused by diseases such as AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis, 
as well as by the harsh drugs often used to treat these conditions. The 
institute concluded that for some patients the potential benefits clearly 
outweigh the risks, and that ways should be found to make marijuana available 
to them.
<P>As a physician, I am frustrated that I cannot prescribe marijuana for 
patients who might benefit from it. At the very least I would like to be able 
to refer them to a safe, reliable, quality-controlled source.
<P>But both the Clinton and Bush administrations have pursued a policy that 
the New England Journal of Medicine has called "misguided, heavy-handed and 
inhumane." They have declined to act on the Institute of Medicine's 
recommendation, and have conducted a series of raids on medical marijuana 
cooperatives operating legally under California law. Sick people are forced to 
turn to street sources, or simply suffer without relief.
<P>So it comes to this: Desperately ill people, their friends, families and 
loved ones, standing outside DEA offices, pleading with their government not 
to deprive them of medicine that relieves their suffering.
<P>It should never have been necessary, and one can only hope that the 
administration and Congress will listen.

<P><I>Dr. Andrew Weil, director of the Program in Integrative Medicine of the College of Medicine, University of Arizona, is the author of "Eight Weeks to Optimum Health" (Ballantine, 1997).</I>
