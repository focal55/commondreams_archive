<p>Bob Woodward is a celebrity reporter perceived as the ultimate insider, but 
for the wrong reasons. He does not reveal anything. He is not analytical or critical, 
a skeptic of any sort or a questioner of any depth, and context is a concept as 
foreign to him as foreign policy. He only conveys an image the "principals" on 
the inside, as Woodward loves to call them, want to reveal. 
<p> Whether his book is about "The Commanders" of the first Gulf War, "The Secret 
Wars of the CIA," "The Agenda" of the Clinton White House or "The Choice" in the 
1996 presidential election, Woodward's loyal method explains why he has ready 
access to all those secret memos, legal pads, National Security Council minutes 
and CIA briefing papers that make up the bulk of his bulky books, and why most 
principals in the end choose to speak with him as opposed to an actual reporter. 
He is the print equivalent of a White House photographer, transcribing official 
moods and postures usually in a light most favorable to those who do speak with 
him, and most unfavorable to those who don't. The books zoom up the bestseller 
charts for the same reason voyeuristic books about celebrities' tics and tiffs 
do: Inquiring minds want to know, and a Woodward book is as close as they'll get 
to a reality show from the White House situation room. 
<p> "Bush at War," Woodward's latest, is a competent, plodding chronicle of the 
Bush cabinet's 100 days from Sept. 11 to the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
A few scoops about the president's sleeping problems or the secretary of defense's 
catfights with the secretary of state are sprinkled along the way to keep the 
story moving, like sex scenes in a Danielle Steel novel, but the book is remarkably 
devoid of anything new or surprising. No average consumer of 22 minutes of daily 
news would be surprised to know that the president is impulsive, intolerant of 
doubt or second-guessing, that the secretary of defense is tyrannical, that the 
vice president can't wait for another war, that the secretary of state's love 
of coalitions makes him the odd man out in an administration of shoot-first unilateralists, 
or that the CIA buys off enemies with trunks of taxpayer cash. (It is surprising 
that dozens of Taliban chiefs' defections can be bought off at $50,000 per while 
lesser foot soldiers have ended up in shackles at Guantanamo Bay.) 
<p> If that's all it was, "Bush at War" wouldn't warrant more than the usual reviews 
and chat-show buzz every Woodward book generates. But even by Woodward's standards, 
this is much less a journalist's book than a White House manifesto, a managed 
reconstruction of recent events not for the sake of telling the story of those 
events, but as a projection of events to come. What B-52s do to soften up enemy 
ground ahead of a military invasion, "Bush At War" is doing to soften up Bush's 
coming war on Iraq and possibly more. Because "Bush at War" is above all a Portrait 
of the President As a Grown-Up, but a grown-up who seems to have no qualms about 
remaking the world in line with his messianic visions. "I'm here for a reason, 
and this is going to be how we're going to be judged," Bush said shortly after 
Sept. 11, explaining why the attacks would prove to be such a huge "opportunity." 
"There's nothing bigger than to achieve world peace," he would say again and again 
a Miss America-like idealist, but as Commander in Chief of the most lethal army 
in history. 
<p> The book's implications are frightening not just because they raise the very 
questions that aren't being asked, but because the "inside" information coincides 
so accurately with what's been perceived on the outside all along. The attacks 
of Sept. 11 were a pretext, and so is the so-called war on terrorism. The aim 
is much larger. The question is not whether the Bush cabinet will take on that 
aim, or whether it can convince Americans to endorse it. The question is how, 
and when. And part of the answer is a book like "Bush at War," which achieves 
both the "how" and implies the "when." It invites that mythical average American 
to have a seat at those super-secret NSC meetings, to watch the commander in chief 
in action and to sense his zeal for "world peace." It turns the reader into a 
partner in the grand design, an insider who, like most members of the Bush cabinet, 
don't question the president's aims, but tell him what he wants to hear. The president, 
Woodward writes, is "casting his mission and that of the country in the grand 
vision of God's master plan." As such, what he wants to hear from his cabinet 
is how to turn the Battle Hymn of the Republic into kinetic energy for the Pentagon. 
What he wants to hear from Americans is "You da man." 
<p> The book's title summarizes the 352-page manifesto without meaning to be so 
reductively simple minded. And yet the meaning of the Bush White House is exactly 
that simple, that mindless. It is about Bush's war not the nation's, not the world's. 
To a president who thinks he's personally doing God's work and the world a favor, 
a doctrine needs be no more complicated than "you're either with us or against 
us," with one correction. He actually means, "You're either with me or against 
me." Richard Nixon would be proud.
