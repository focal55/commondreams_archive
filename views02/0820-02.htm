<p>Are the American people ready for war?</p>
<p>The American public has been remarkably taciturn in the face of screaming hints 
that the Bush administration is posturing for war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Many experts, including conservatives, have questioned both the need for and 
the costs of war in Iraq.</p>
<p>But the public discussion has been tepid and hushed, as if being held in a 
library. I've heard more passion about the looming baseball strike than about 
possible American casualties in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Few candidates for office have questioned this war talk. There have been no 
noteworthy antiwar demonstrations -- or pro-war demonstrations, for that matter. 
Today's college students -- whose generation would fight the war -- have said 
nothing.</p>
<p>This public reticence in the face of contemplated American military aggression 
is astounding. Have we nothing at all to say? Is there no debate to be staged?</p>
<p>The only 20th century war instigated by the United States without direct provocation 
-- not counting a few minuscule, all-but-unopposed operations in places like Grenada, 
Panama and Haiti -- was its most disastrous: Vietnam. In every other case, either 
we or nations friendly to us were attacked by hostile forces.</p>
<p>Americans generally aren't keen on war, but we won't brook hostile action against 
Uncle Sam. Knowing this, President Lyndon Johnson in 1964 invented the Gulf of 
Tonkin incident.</p>
<p>The attack Johnson described never occurred. But he told the nation America 
had to respond. Before we knew what we were doing or why, we were mired in a war 
that we couldn't win and couldn't leave.</p>
<p>The body bags began to mount. A domestic antiwar movement spontaneously ignited 
as the American public finally began to ask the relevant questions: Why are we 
there? What are we fighting to achieve?</p>
<p>The young protesters were denounced by the establishment as unpatriotic, if 
not traitorous, for not supporting the government. They were castigated for undercutting 
our combat forces in the field.</p>
<p>Today, 29 years after we skulked out of Vietnam, familiar rhetoric surfaces 
again: It's unpatriotic to question your government's saber rattling. Wave your 
flag and shut up.</p>
<p>Pardon me for raising my hand, but doesn't the government work for us? Aren't 
we supposed to be scrutinizing its every action? Isn't open debate, not compulsory 
jingoism, the truest expression of democratic principles?</p>
<p>The Vietnam protest generation is today's establishment, and we're conflicted: 
We were right about Vietnam but wrong to scorn individual U.S. soldiers. Sept. 
11 inspired a spirited patriotism such as we hadn't known in our lifetimes, and 
it feels good. Questioning Washington is discomforting.</p>
<p>My fear is that this is precisely what President Bush's hawks are counting 
on.</p>
<p>The American public was solidly behind the campaign to crush the Taliban government, 
which harbored combatants who attacked the United States and vowed to do it again.</p>
<p>But Bush cornered himself with his own inflamed war rhetoric. He promised us 
Osama bin Laden's head and hasn't delivered it. He identified an ''Axis of Evil'' 
and now can't fail to act against it.</p>
<p>Though there are differences, today's anti-terror talk sounds eerily reminiscent 
of the anti-communism talk of a generation ago. Should we oppose communism and 
terror? Yes. Does it mean that anything and everything goes? No.</p>
<p>Thousands of Americans died in Vietnam because a handful of Washington bureaucrats 
were too drunk with their own machismo to chart a different course.</p>
<p>We mustn't stand by and watch this happen again.</p>
<p>The Vietnam protest generation should have learned this: If we don't want our 
government to initiate a questionable war halfway around the world, we'd better 
speak up now -- before, not after, the body bags start arriving.</p>
