<p>One of our best-kept secrets is the degree to which a handful of huge corporations 
control the flow of information in the United States. Whether it is television, 
radio, newspapers, magazines, books or the Internet, a few giant conglomerates 
are determining what we see, hear and read. And the situation is likely to become 
much worse as a result of radical deregulation efforts by the Bush administration 
and some horrendous court decisions.</p>
<p>Television is the means by which most Americans get their &#147;news.&#148; 
Without exception, every major network is owned by a huge conglomerate that has 
enormous conflicts of interest. Fox News Channel is owned by Rupert Murdoch, a 
right-wing Australian who already owns a significant portion of the world&#146;s 
media. His network has close ties to the Republican Party, and among his &#147;fair 
and balanced&#148; commentators is Newt Gingrich.</p>
<p>NBC is owned by General Electric, one of the largest corporations in the world 
&#151; and one with a long history of anti-union activity. GE, a major contributor 
to the Republican Party, has substantial financial interests in weapons manufacturing, 
finance, nuclear power and many other industries. Former CEO Jack Welch was one 
of the leaders in shutting down American plants and moving them to low-wage countries 
like China and Mexico.</p>
<p>ABC is owned by the Disney Corp., which produces toys and products in developing 
countries where they provide their workers atrocious wages and working conditions.</p>
<p>CBS is owned by Viacom, another huge media conglomerate that owns, among other 
entities, MTV, Showtime, Nickelodeon, VH1, TNN, CMT, 39 broadcast television stations, 
184 radio stations, Paramount Pictures and Blockbuster Inc.</p>
<p>The essential problem with television is not just a right-wing bias in news 
and programming, or the transformation of politics and government into entertainment 
and sensationalism. Nor is it just the constant bombardment of advertising, much 
of it directed at children. It&#146;s that the most important issues facing the 
middle-class and working people of our country are rarely discussed. The average 
American does not see his or her reality reflected on the television screen.</p>
<p>The United States is the only industrialized nation on earth that does not 
have a national healthcare program. Yet, despite 41 million people with no health 
insurance and millions more underinsured, we spend far more per capita on healthcare 
than any other nation. Maybe the reason is that we are seeing no good programs 
on television, in between the prescription drug advertisements, discussing how 
we can provide quality healthcare for all at far lower per capita costs than we 
presently spend?</p>
<p>Despite the great &#147;economic boom&#148; of the 1990s, the average American 
worker is now working longer hours for lower wages than 30 years ago, and we have 
lost millions of decent-paying manufacturing jobs. Where are the TV programs addressing 
our $360 billion trade deficit, or what our disastrous trade policy has done to 
depress wages in this country? And while we&#146;re on economics, workers who 
are in unions earn 30 percent more than non-union people doing the same work. 
There are a lot of programs on television about how to get rich by investing in 
the stock market. But have you seen any &#147;specials&#148; on how to go about 
forming a union?</p>
<p>The United States has the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in 
the industrialized world, and the highest rate of childhood poverty. There&#146;s 
a lot of television promoting greed and self-interest, but how many programs speak 
to the &#147;justice&#148; of the richest 1 percent owning more wealth than the 
bottom 95 percent? Or of the CEOs of major corporations earning 500 times what 
their employees make?</p>
<p>If television largely ignores the reality of life for the majority of Americans, 
corporate radio is just plain overt in its right-wing bias. In a nation that cast 
a few million more votes for Al Gore and Ralph Nader than for George Bush and 
Pat Buchanan, there are dozens of right-wing talk show programs. Rush Limbaugh, 
G. Gordon Liddy, Bob Grant, Sean Hannity, Alan Keyes, Armstrong Williams, Howie 
Carr, Oliver North, Michael Savage, Michael Reagan, Pat Robertson, Laura Schlessinger 
&#151; these are only a few of the voices that day after day pound a right-wing 
drumbeat into the heartland of this country.</p>
<p>And from a left perspective there is &#151; well, no one. The Republican Party, 
corporate owners and advertisers have their point of view well represented on 
radio. Unfortunately, the rest of America has almost nothing. As bad as the current 
media situation is, it is likely to be made much worse by a recent decision in 
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that responded to a suit by Fox, AOL 
Time Warner, NBC and Viacom. That decision struck down a federal regulation limiting 
companies from owning television stations and cable franchises in the same local 
markets. The court also ordered that the Federal Communications Commission either 
justify or rewrite the federal rule that limits any one company from owning television 
stations that reach more than 35 percent of American households.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that fewer and fewer huge conglomerates are controlling 
virtually everything that the ordinary American sees, hears and reads. This is 
an issue that Congress can no longer ignore.</p>
