<p>Has the war on terrorism become the modern equivalent of the Roman Circus, 
drawing the people's attention away from the failures of those who rule them? 
Corporate America is a shambles because deregulation, the mantra of our president 
and his party, has proved to be a license to steal. Yet to question our leaders' 
stewardship of the economy has been made to seem unpatriotic.
<p>Although combating terrorism is of compelling importance--and should have been 
before Sept. 11--one is likely to be branded a nut for daring to suggest that 
the administration might be using current security threats as a smoke screen to 
obscure our floundering economy.
<p>Yet, after the miserable performance of the stock market these past five weeks, 
the forced resignations and indictments of corporate titans (not to mention the 
conviction of a top accounting firm), the humbling of the dollar and a rise in 
the trade gap, isn't it time to ask whether the war on terrorism isn't being milked 
as a convenient distraction? The question seems particularly relevant when our 
man in the White House has had close personal and financial ties to the company--Enron--whose 
demise is the most glaring symbol of the broad moral disarray of the nation's 
corporate culture.
<p>Is there any doubt that the chicanery of Enron executives and that of a growing 
Who's Who of top CEOs has done more long-term damage to the U.S. economy than 
the efforts of anti-American terrorists? And while sending in the Marines to clean 
up the boardrooms is not feasible, we ought to wake up to the reality that business 
greed is subverting the American way of life--and hurting the image of American 
capitalism and democracy--more effectively than the ploys of any foreign enemy.
<p>When even Martha Stewart is ethically suspect and her company's stock has plummeted--though 
not quite to the depths of Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco, Dynergy, Wal-Mart and 
Rite Aid--it is time to return to the wisdom of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 
Depression-era president who saved capitalism from itself.
<p>Wealthy from birth, FDR had a healthy awareness of the tendency of the upper 
classes to destabilize society and even destroy themselves with their greed and 
hubris. Unlike Karl Marx, however, he believed the unraveling of capitalism was 
not inevitable if these excesses could somehow be corralled. Thus was born the 
idea of government regulation as the vital support structure for the powerful, 
fertile but unstable free market.
<p>Unfortunately, greedy people and institutions don't like being monitored, and 
they have the means to corrupt governments and skirt laws.
<p>Since the so-called Reagan Revolution, powerful corporate interests have succeeded 
in profoundly damaging the foundation of a properly regulated economy. Company 
auditors, for example, have become accomplices to deceptions of the public that 
should be considered criminal but that often do not violate statutes written by 
corporate lobbyists.
<p>Enron provides a startling illustration of a company jumping through loopholes 
that its D.C. lobbyists have created. In fact, the Enron scams made possible by 
deregulation in the first Bush administration are still being revealed, such as 
last week's reports that the company hid billions in income during the California 
energy crisis while publicly denying it was profiting excessively.
<p>Yet former Enron officials continue to play an important role under Bush the 
younger. The Bush family, in fact, has never been seriously confronted by the 
media or Congress as to its questionable ties to former Enron Chief Executive 
Kenneth Lay, a close family friend and top contributor to Bush family presidential 
campaigns.
<p>To be fair, the corporate corruption of our political system has long been 
bipartisan. The Clinton White House, for example, sponsored major deregulation 
acts, including the Financial Services Modernization Act, which reversed consumer 
protections enacted under Roosevelt, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which 
effectively ended all public accountability for the communications industry and 
has permitted a few media giants to gobble up vast markets.
<p>Clearly, the problem is bipartisan when a Democrat-controlled Senate moves 
so hesitantly to confront the myriad examples of sickness in our economy and corporate 
culture. 
<p>The politicians hesitate to act because candidates of both parties are lavishly 
financed by the very people who are conning a gullible public.
