<p>In attempting to make the case for invading Iraq, President Bush's speech 
Monday night revealed the folly of the new doctrine of pre-emptive attack. 
More clearly than any other statement by the White House, the president laid 
bare the weakness of his administration's foreign policy.
<P>According to the president, "we cannot wait for the final proof" that 
Saddam Hussein's government is planning an imminent attack against the United 
States. Even though President Bush acknowledged in his speech that Iraq does 
not currently threaten the United States, he said we must "assume the worst." 
Essentially, the White House is proposing that the United States invade a 
distant country without any evidence of impending aggression.
<P>Bush also spoke of an "international coalition" that would disarm Hussein. 
Bush knows the American public is loathe to go it alone. What he failed to do 
was tell us who the members of his war coalition are. Why? Because there is no 
coalition. Quite the contrary, Bush's aggressive rhetoric, disregard for 
international law, and his lack of any vision other than war without end is 
causing traditional friends of the United States to join the majority of the 
world's nations in distancing themselves from Washington in a fashion not seen 
since the Vietnam War.
<P>The flimsy justifications President Bush has provided for an urgent Iraq invasion 
have not convinced the world community. Iraq's neighbors, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, 
reject the notion of an imminent threat. The Muslim world -- whose support is 
vital to any real effort to end the causes of terrorism -- is adamantly opposed. 
In Europe, only England's Tony Blair and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi have voiced 
support for Bush. They both do so in the face of majority opposition from their 
fellow citizens and street demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people. 
<P>Many in the global community also distrust the Bush administration's 
expanding war aims. It is not easy for our friends around the world to stomach 
the imperial scent of our newly enunciated military doctrine that proposes pre-
emption of any powerful rivals.
<P>The president wants to launch a war based on assumptions, and therein lies 
a problem. One of the great advances of the modern era has been the spread of 
the rule of law. This is the now common idea that democratically decided laws -
- not the capriciousness of individual rulers -- should govern human affairs.
<P>During the last half of the 20th century, this principle was expanded 
internationally through the United Nations. The U.N. weapons inspections in 
Iraq represent a good example of how the rule of law has been used, and can be 
used again, to avert conflict.
<P>Perhaps most repugnant to our allies is the transparent effort by the Bush 
Administration to eviscerate U.N. inspection and disarmament activities. They 
see a pattern of the Bush administration continuously upping the ante with 
Iraq, apparently to avoid a non-military outcome. They know that an American 
invasion will dramatically undermine the painstakingly constructed framework 
of international law built since World War II. The White House's belief that 
it can invade nations pre-emptively, without proof of an imminent attack, 
represents a major assault on that international rule of law.
<P>The Bush Administration's doctrine of pre-emptive attack raises troubling 
questions. What burden of proof will be used to decide when a pre-emptive 
attack is called for? If only assumptions are needed to launch a war, how will 
we separate true threats from phantom menaces? If clear evidence of impending 
aggression is not required to invade another country, what standards will be 
employed to decide when, where, and who to attack?
<P>By tossing out any reasonable standards of evidence as a prerequisite for 
military action, the White House puts us in a state of constant uncertainty 
and increased insecurity where almost anything could lead to war.
<P>President Bush says he wants to avoid "a future of fear." It's an admirable 
goal, but one hardly served by this new doctrine. In fact, the idea of pre-
emptive attack depends on fear. It presupposes insecurity and assumes we will 
always be threatened. Whereas the Cold War doctrine of deterrence and 
containment rested on strength, the new idea of pre-emption insists on U.S. 
vulnerability.
<P>There is no security in a world where wars can be started on nothing more 
than assumptions. When the smallest suspicion or the least distrust can ignite 
conflict, no one is safe. In the long run, pre-emptive wars will break down 
the international rule of law and erode global stability, jeopardizing all 
nations' security.
<P>President Bush's pre-emptive wars won't preserve the peace. Rather, the 
notion of pre-emptive war makes conflict all the more likely. It sets the 
United States on a course of permanent war.
<P>Members of Congress who stood in opposition to Bush have shown courage and 
wisdom. They are reflecting a profound unease with this war across the United 
States. In poll after poll, majorities of Americans are on the record being 
opposed to war with Iraq if the United States acts alone. Our leaders should 
listen to the people. We know our true safety as a nation flows from 
cooperation, not unilateral war.
