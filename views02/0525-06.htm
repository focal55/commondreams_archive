<p>FEW WOULD dispute that our health care system is deeply troubled. 
Thirty-nine million Americans are completely uninsured and millions 
more have inadequate coverage. After a brief lull, health care costs 
have resumed their exuberant growth; health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs) have fallen to the basement of public esteem and have failed 
to contain costs; commercial pressures threaten medicine's best 
traditions; and healing has become a spectator sport, with physicians 
and patients performing before a growing audience of bureaucrats and 
reviewers. Opinion on solutions is more divided.

<P>Debate over health care reform has been muted since the defeat of the 
Clinton Administration Rube Goldberg scheme for universal coverage. 
But the fast developing health care crisis--business leaders 
grappling with rapidly rising premiums, workers and unions facing 
cutbacks in coverage, governments confronting deficits, and a sharp 
upturn in the number unemployed and uninsured--promises to spur new 
interest in reform.

<P>We advocate a fundamental change in health care financing, national 
health insurance (NHI), because we are convinced that lesser measures 
will fail.

<P>In the 35 years since the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid, a 
welter of patchwork reforms has been tried. Health maintenance 
organizations and diagnosis related groups promised to contain costs 
and free up funds to expand coverage. Billions of dollars have been 
allocated to expanding Medicaid and similar programs for children. 
Both Medicare and Medicaid have tried managed care. Oregon essayed 
rationing in its Medicaid program, Massachusetts and Hawaii passed 
laws requiring all employers to cover their workers, Tennessee 
promised nearly universal coverage, and several states have 
implemented high-risk pools to insure high-cost individuals. 
For-profit firms pledged to bring business-like efficiency to running 
HMOs, hospitals, dialysis clinics, and nursing homes. And market 
competition has roiled health care's waters.

<P>None of these initiatives has made a dent in the number of uninsured, 
durably controlled costs, or lessened the inexorable 
bureaucratization of medicine.

<P>All such patchwork reforms founder on a simple problem: expanding 
coverage must increase costs unless resources are diverted from 
elsewhere in the system. With US health care costs nearly double 
those of any other nation and rising more rapidly,1 and the economy 
gone sour, large infusions of new money are unlikely.

<P>Absent new money, patchwork reforms can only expand coverage by 
siphoning resources from existing clinical care. Advocates of managed 
care and market competition once argued that their strategy could 
accomplish this by trimming clinical fat. Unfortunately, new layers 
of bureaucrats have invariably overseen the managed care "diet" 
prescribed for clinicians and patients. Such cost management 
bureaucracies are not only intrusive but expensive, devouring 
virtually all of the clinical savings.

<P>Resources seep inexorably from the bedside to the executive suite. 
The shortage of bedside nurses coexists with a proliferation of RN 
utilization reviewers. Productivity pressures mount for clinicians, 
while colleagues who have withdrawn from the bedside to the executive 
suite rule our profession.

<P>Bureaucracy now consumes nearly 30% of our health care budget.2-4

<P>The latest policy nostrums--medical savings accounts and voucher 
schemes like President Bush's "premium support" proposal for 
Medicare--would further amplify bureaucracy and limit care. Medical 
savings accounts discourage preventive and primary care, while 
failing to curb the high cost of care for severe illnesses (which 
account for most health spending). Such plans would also require 
insurers to start keeping track of all out-of-pocket spending, while 
retaining their existing bureaucracy, and would slash the 
cross-subsidy from healthy enrollees to the sick.

<P>Voucher programs are thinly veiled mechanisms to cut care. The 
vouchers offered are invariably too skimpy to purchase fully adequate 
coverage, forcing lower-income individuals into substandard plans. 
Voucher schemes also posit that frail elders and other vulnerable 
patients will make wise purchasing decisions from a welter of 
confusing insurance options. Finally, vouchers would boost insurance 
overhead by shifting people from group plans (ie, Medicare or 
employer groups) into the individual insurance market where overhead 
averages more than 35% of premiums.5

<P>WHY NHI?

<P>The fiscal case for NHI arises from the observation that health 
care's enormous bureacratic burden is a peculiarly American 
phenomenon. No nation with NHI spends even half as much administering 
care, nor tolerates the bureaucratic intrusions in clinical care that 
have become routine in the United States.

<P>Our biggest HMOs keep 20%, even 25%, of premiums for their overhead 
and profit6; Canada's NHI has 1% overhead2 and even Medicare takes 
less than 4%.7 And HMOs inflict mountains of paperwork on physicians 
and hospitals. The average US hospital spends one quarter of its 
budget on billing and administration,4 nearly twice the average in 
Canada. American physicians spend nearly 8 hours per week on 
paperwork, and employ 1.66 clerical workers per physician,8 far more 
than in Canada.

<P>Reducing our bureaucratic apparatus to Canadian levels would save 10% 
to 15% of current health care spending, at least $120 billion 
annually, enough to fully cover the uninsured and upgrade coverage 
for those now underinsured. Proponents of NHI,9 disinterested civil 
servants,10, 11 and even skeptics12 all agree on this point.

<P>HOW NHI? Unfortunately, piecemeal tinkering cannot achieve 
significant bureaucratic savings. The key to administrative 
simplicity in Canada (and other nations) is single-source payment. 
Canadian hospitals (mostly private, nonprofit institutions) do not 
bill for individual patients. They are paid a global annual budget to 
cover all costs, much as a fire department is funded in the United 
States. Physicians (most of whom are in private practice) bill by 
checking a box on a simple insurance form. Fee schedules are 
negotiated annually between provincial medical associations and 
governments. All patients have the same coverage.

<P>Unfortunately, during the 1990s Canada's program was starved of funds 
by governments responsive to pressure from the healthy and wealthy 
who sought to avoid cross-subsidizing care for the sick and poor. 
Where once Canadian and US health care spending were comparable, 
today, Canada spends barely half (per capita) what we do.1 Shortages 
of expensive, high-technology care have resulted. Yet, Canada's 
health outcomes remain better than ours (eg, life expectancy is 2 
years longer1), and most quality comparisons indicate that Canadians 
enjoy care equivalent to that for insured Americans. A system 
structured like Canada's, but with double the funding, could provide 
high-quality care without the waits or shortages that Canadians have 
experienced.

<P>The NHI that we propose would create a single tax-funded 
comprehensive insurer in each state, federally mandated but locally 
controlled. Everyone would be fully insured for all medically 
necessary services, and private insurance duplicating the NHI 
coverage would be proscribed (as is currently the case with 
Medicare). The current byzantine insurance bureaucracy with its 
tangle of regulations and wasteful duplication would be dismantled. 
Instead, the NHI trust fund would dispense all payments, and central 
administrative costs would be limited by law to less than 3% of total 
health care spending.

<P>Each hospital and nursing home would negotiate an annual global 
budget with the NHI, based on past expenditures, projected changes in 
costs and use, and proposed new and innovative programs. Many 
hospital administrative tasks would disappear. There would be no 
hospital bills to keep track of, no eligibility determination, and no 
need to attribute costs and charges to individual patients. Cost 
shifting would be pointless as there would be nowhere to shift costs 
to.

<P>Clinics and group practices could elect to be paid fee-for-service, 
or receive global budgets similar to hospitals. While HMOs that 
merely contract with providers for care would be eliminated, those 
that actually employ physicians and own clinical facilities could 
receive global budgets, fee-for-service, or capitation payments (with 
the proviso that capitation payments could not be diverted to profits 
or exorbitant executive compensation).

<P>As in Canada, physicians could elect to be paid on a fee-for-service 
basis, or receive salaries from hospitals, clinics, or HMOs.

<P>Properly structured, NHI would not raise costs; administrative 
savings would pay for the expanded coverage. While NHI would require 
new taxes, these would be fully offset by a decrease in insurance 
premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Moreover, the additional tax burden 
would be smaller than is usually appreciated, since nearly 60% of 
health care spending is already tax supported (vs roughly 70% in 
Canada). Besides Medicare, Medicaid, and other explicit public 
programs, our governments fund tax subsidies for private insurance 
that exceed $100 billion annually.13 In addition, local, state, and 
federal agencies that purchase private coverage for government 
workers account for 22.5% of total employer health care spending 
(D.U.H. and S.W., unpublished analysis of Current Population Survey 
data from the US Census Bureau, 2001).

<P>Demonstration projects in 1 or more states might precede national 
implementation of NHI. Initially, funding might mimic existing 
patterns to minimize economic disruption, but all payments would be 
funneled through the NHI trust fund. Thus, Medicare and Medicaid 
moneys, as well as current government expenditures for employee 
health benefits, would go to the trust fund. Employers would pay a 
tax equivalent to the average now spent for health benefits. In the 
long run, a shift to a more progressive, income tax funding base 
would provide a fairer and more efficient revenue stream.

<P>The NHI we propose faces important political obstacles. The virtual 
elimination of private health insurance will evoke stiff opposition 
from insurance firms. Similarly, investor-owned hospitals and drug 
firms fear that NHI would curtail their profits.

<P>Practical problems in implementing NHI also loom. The financial 
viability of the system we propose is critically dependent on 
achieving and maintaining administrative simplicity. Canada's 
macromanagement approach to cost control -- enforcing overall 
budgetary limits is inherently less administratively complex than our 
current micromanagement approach, with its case-by-case scrutiny of 
billions of individual expenditures and encounters. However, even 
under NHI, vigilance (and statutory limits) would be needed to curb 
the tendency of bureaucracy to reproduce and amplify itself.

<P>National health insurance could solve the cost-vs-access conflict by 
slashing bureaucratic waste. It would reorient the way we pay for 
care, and eliminate financial barriers to access. National health 
insurance could restore the physician-patient relationship, offer 
patients a free choice of physicians and hospitals, and free 
physicians from the bonds of managed care.

<P>How many more failed patchwork reforms, how many more patients turned 
away from care they cannot afford, how many trillions of dollars 
squandered on malignant bureaucracy, before we adopt the only viable 
solution: NHI?
