<p>Medieval scientists sought to turn base metals into gold, creating 
wealth for themselves and their rulers.  Likewise, modern science, 
harnessed by capitalists, seeks to turn fresh water into gold.  While 
the former failed in their explicit goals, they set out a path leading 
to the field of chemistry.  The latter group, led by transnational 
corporations in the water industry, doubly succeeded.  

<p>First, the fundamental ingredient of the modern day alchemists is 
freshwater, H2O, not base metals.  Fresh water is more valuable to life 
on earth than any amount of gold.  Water is the elixir of life, in which 
our vary body's composition and survival depend on.  It is necessary for 
our food to grow, our rivers to flow, and to support a plethora of 
diverse ecosystems and species on Earth.  For all their acclaimed worth, 
gold and diamonds cannot compete with water.  Compounding the problem, 
less than 1% of all water is accessible for consumption. 

<p>Second, transnational corporations (TNCs) have found a method of 
converting water to gold.  The research and development department, 
probably headed by some free market "think tank", searched for ways to 
improve water, and the solution was simple: make it a product, own it, 
sell it.  The catalyst in this reaction is privatization.  TNCs, with 
the backing of US hegemony and its neoliberal institutions -- the World 
Bank and International Monetary Fund -- have once again revolutionized 
the means of creating wealth, capital, gold. Privatization removes 
publicly owned water supplies from the public and into the hands of 
private companies, with private interests -- turning water to gold.  Its 
needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, gold can't sustain life. 
  
<p>The private water industry seizes water out of the very mouths of the 
thirsty and deposits it in the coffers of TNCs, where they work their 
magic metamorphosing water into gold.  Privatization reverses the 
seemingly irreversible flow of water -- from life-giving to life-taking. 
Water, long-viewed as a common property resource available to all, and 
basic human right, is transformed into a commodity.  It is bought and 
sold. Paid for in meaningless pieces of paper stamped with God and $.  

<p>The message is simple: if you want to live, pay up.  Conversely, if you 
can't pay, you don't have a right to life.  That has been the lesson 
Western capitalism is attempting to teach the rest of the world. From 
Bolivia to Argentina to Ghana to the Philippines, water privatization 
combined with a prohibition on public subsidies for the poor, has 
elevated the (lack of) rules of the market above human rights.  

<p>How do TNCs convert water to gold? They charge more.  When water is 
privatized, prices go up.  When prices go up, access to water goes down. 
In the industrialized country of Great Britain, rate hikes after 
privatization caused poorer residents to lose access to water in their 
homes, because they couldn't afford to pay for it.  The consequences in 
countries where two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, such as 
Cochabamba, Bolivia, are grave.  There, people rejected a World Bank 
sanctioned privatization scheme, even after it was implemented. So too 
in Tucuman, Argentina.  And the struggle continues in Ghana, as the 
government plans to privatize water there.  Modern alchemists have 
succeeded in creating a reaction that increases the wealth of the few, 
at the cost of the many.  Privatization experiments span all continents. 
The G8 summit deep in the Canadian forest last week produced plans to 
expand experimentation across Africa, as a component of Western "aid" 
packages to reduce suffering of hundreds of millions on the African 
continent. 

<p>What will the results be? If history is any indicator of the future, the privatization 
of water and subsequent creation of gold for TNCs has many byproducts, none of 
which are beneficial to the populace. Take Cochabamba, Bolivia as an example. 
There, the municipal water supply was taken from the city and control was centralized 
at the state level. Then the public water utility was sold to a consortium of 
US and Italian-based TNCs, without public comment, participation, or approval, 
and at the order of the World Bank. Rate hikes soared, and many residents were 
unable to pay. On the bright side, peaceful demonstrations ensued, grassroots 
coalitions formed, and negotiations began. Democracy flourished in reaction to 
an undemocratic and unjust co-optation of public resources. Then violence erupted 
from the arms of the state, in a desperate attempt to quash protest and maintain 
the status quo -- a neoliberal policy of privatization benefiting the world?s 
elite at the cost of the majority poor. 
<p>At the same time, the new private water alchemist, Aguas del Tunari, 
worked steadily to turn its water into gold.  Yet that gold is liken to 
a magician's illusion rather than a chemist's reaction.  Wealth isn't 
immaculately conceived by capitalism either, although capitalists and 
developers like to think they are doing God's work.  Instead, the gold 
comes from the people. It is transferred from water consumers to 
transnational capitalists. From those in need to those consumed by 
greed. 

<p>History also shows us that people can successfully oppose privatization 
of their water.  In Cochabamba and Tucuman, water contracts were 
cancelled due to popular resistance.  The TNCs were ousted, but their 
search for gold continues.  In both cases, the TNCs involved are suing 
the citizens of both countries, through the World Bank's arbitration 
branch, for millions of dollars in compensation for the loss of 
"potential profits."  When providing services doesn't cut it, they go 
straight for the throat.  As these countries are beholden to 
international financial institutions, the citizens are held captive 
under an enormous, unsustainable debt that pits the interest of capital 
against the interests of life. 

<p>Which will prevail? Popular victories are adding up, as people mobilize 
to resist capitalism, neoliberalism, and its privatization tool.  Yet 
Western economic and cultural domination looms large.  It has just 
expanded the experimentation to Africa, a continent where reparation is 
needed more than loans.  The stated intentions of development "aid" to 
help the three-quarters world appears, based on concrete evidence and 
past experiences, to be the antithesis of the actual results.  If 
history repeats itself in Africa, millions will be left worse off, with 
even less access to clean water and sanitation.  Illness, disease, and 
death are sure to follow.  Perhaps this is the G8's solution to the 
world's perceived "population problem" -- privatize their resources, take 
their money, and watch them die.  After all, the goal of capitalism 
isn't to sustain life, but to produce wealth, even at the cost of life.
