<p>In these days of doublespeak war hysteria, it seems
oddly appropriate that a parallel universe has suddenly
been discovered, a world of energy and annihilation
hiding behind hydrogen's confrontation with its evil
twin, antihydrogen...

<p>The impending war belies a mirror world of a different
sort - one of destruction and annihilation concealed
behind lies and omissions masquerading as truth.

<p>It's the tortured logic "President" Bush recently used
to justify the unlimited war powers he craves: "If you
want to keep the peace, you've got to have the
authorization to use force."

<p>But as our leaders rally for another Persian Gulf
blowout, they seem to have forgotten the unspoken world
of toxicity our troops were exposed to in the 1991 Gulf
War - and the increased dangers awaiting today's
service members.

<p>While 147 US troops were killed in action in the Gulf War, <a href="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/news/0902/25iraqvets.html" target="_new">almost 
7,800 have since died</a> and close to 200,000 (or a whopping 28%) have filed 
claims for medical and compensation benefits. The UK figures are proportionately 
similar, and shockingly, of the 537 UK vets that have died since the Gulf War 
ended, a full 70% killed themselves. 
<p>The suspected culprit? A deadly syndrome called Gulf
War Illness which, despite $150 million and years of
studies, remains elusive. Potential causes could be the unproved vaccines and drugs that were forced on troops, oil-well fire pollution, radiation from allied-forces Depleted Uranium Munitions, or an especially horrific case of friendly fire, the exposure of more than 100,000 service members to chemical warfare agents when US forces conducted demolition operations at Khamisiyah.

<p>Despite the debilitating physical and emotional consequences of Gulf War Illness, 
however, vets were denied treatment for many years and still face an uphill battle 
in getting proper support or compensation. The US Department for Veterans' Affairs 
has been <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28958" target="_new">accused 
of withholding death and disability statistics</a> so as not to undermine the 
administration's case for another Gulf war, and only a few weeks ago, almost 12 
years after the fact, was a study finally published stating that Gulf War Illness 
is not "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,791660,00.html" target="_new">just 
in the minds</a>" of sufferers. 
<p>But factors such as veteran disability and suffering
are not part of the administration's world-domination
equation: an unlimited number of fresh young troops is necessary for an unlimited war and if the toxic dangers they will face are even greater than those before them (given the emphasis on ground warfare) then so be it. Simple message: service members are heroes when fighting but when not, they are an expendable liability.

<p>It's interesting to note a similar laissez faire
attitude regarding toxicity happening right here at
home, and vicariously coming from a familiar source:
truth and justice's evil twin, US "Vice President" Dick
Cheney.

<p>As CEO of oil-field services company Halliburton, Cheney engineered the purchase 
of a number of companies which later got hit with asbestos-related claims, a liability 
that is now estimated will run Halliburton $2.2 billion over the next 15 years. 
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/080400-02.htm">Cheney has pushed 
for legislation</a> limiting workers' rights to file claims for asbestos-related 
illnesses, but he is not alone in the fight - 250 of the world's largest corporations 
recently petitioned the US Supreme Court to make it harder for victims to sue. 
<p>With the number of claims in the hundreds of thousands
and rising every day, however, it is clear the asbestos time-bomb can't be denied. Fred Baron, a Dallas-based trial lawyer representing asbestos victims, has said "there will be a jihad" against those individuals and corporations trying to limit a victim's right to sue, and adds "we will fight them with everything we've got."

<p>At issue are toxic dangers (at home and abroad) linked
by governmental and corporate denial regarding their
deadly effects on the population. But the hazards and
suffering this toxicity brings can no longer be
relegated to some unacknowledged separate world; we
must expose our hidden bombs for what they are, then
demand justice for those afflicted and fight to prevent
new casualties.
