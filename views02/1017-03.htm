<p>HONOLULU &#151; A dozen young journalists from across Asia listened carefully 
to the words of President Bush as he addressed Americans on his need for congressional 
authority to go to war against Iraq. For most, it was their first visit to this 
country. The journalists are Jefferson Fellows at the East-West Center in Honolulu, 
beginning a month-long introduction to U.S. policies, politics and media. 
<p>Initial reactions were measured, in the polite manner of Asians &#151; even 
journalists. A day later, they reflected on what they heard and what they knew 
of their own countries. The reflections are not encouraging for hawkish elements 
of American leadership. 
<p>No one was applauding, several were still noncommittal, but there was a strong 
air of concern. 
<p>An Indonesian reporter recalled Bush's words, "we will not live in fear," and 
suggested that others, too, had the right not to live in fear &#151; and many 
are fearful of this proposed war against Iraq. Put simply, much of Asia is afraid 
of us, our rashness and our lack of long-term staying power. 
<p>Shaheen Salahuddin, an outspoken Pakistani television reporter and anchor, 
was most forceful. There will be no support in Pakistan, she said, and radical 
movements will be encouraged. Three days later, hard-line Muslim factions were 
victorious in the Pakistani parliamentary vote. 
<p>Salahuddin was critical of American abandonment of Afghanistan after the Russian 
pullout, citing that as an underlying factor in the rise of the Taliban. Afghan 
refugees, more than a million, are a destabilizing factor in Pakistan, she said, 
and many will stay because conditions even in the worst parts of Pakistan are 
better than those in Afghanistan. 
<p>Pakistan is one of two Muslim nations with reporters in the Jefferson program 
this year. The other is Indonesia, largest Muslim nation in the world. 
<p>Bambang Harymurti, editor-in-chief of Tempo magazine and one of Indonesia's 
most-respected journalists, was a guest of the program, and discussed the threat 
of a Muslim backlash in Indonesia. He made his comments before the bombing Saturday 
in Bali. 
<p>In respect to Iraq, Harymurti said a "quick and clean" campaign could be positive, 
if it brought regime change and the destruction in Iraq was minimal. But he said 
he feared, instead, a "messy, another Vietnam" type of action, and that would 
be a serious blow for moderate Muslim nations such as Indonesia. 
<p>Indonesia, he told the group, houses radical Islamists but they are a minority 
and not supported by most Indonesians. Help democracies develop in nations such 
as Indonesia, he pleaded: "It's better for outsiders to let us create our own 
(democratic leaders). ... Americans want instant democracy and you cannot create 
instant democracy." 
<p>Harymurti believes Indonesia must be taken more seriously by Western powers, 
and could be a test of whether democracy and Islam can co-exist. Indonesia has 
moved throughout history from Buddhism to Hinduism to Islam, changes coming through 
trade with nations holding those faiths, he noted. The result is a largely secular 
country in its politics and government, although 90 percent of its population 
is Muslim. 
<p>Although journalists from Pakistan and Indonesia were most outspoken, having 
the most at risk as the U.S. confronts an Islamic state, other Asian journalists 
were skeptical of the Bush initiative. 
<p>Chit Win Maung, a soft-spoken magazine editor from Myanmar (Burma), expressed 
concern that the United States has never started a war in the past, that it was 
against the ideals that others believe Americans have. 
<p>Others are still dealing with the trauma of conflicts more horrific than 9/11. 
A young Cambodian reporter and editor, Thet Sambath, described how the trials 
of Khmer Rouge leaders still split his nation, which lost 2 million people to 
the ravages of Pol Pot. 
<p>In much of Asia, noted Indonesian reporter Ardian Gesuri, serious economic 
problems are the priority of governments that would be hard-pressed to deal with 
them if an American attack on Iraq creates an Islamic backlash. 
<p>One of the functions of the Jefferson Fellowships, an East-West Center program 
for 35 years, is to broaden the horizons of both American and Asian-Pacific fellows. 
Asian journalists, close to the pulse of their nations, could do much to broaden 
the outlook of Americans who believe invading Iraq is a slam-dunk without other 
repercussions. 
<p>You won't convince Pakistan's Shaheen Salahuddin, Indonesia's Bambang Harymurti, 
Myanmar's Chit Win Maung or most of the other dozen journalists in Honolulu that 
such is the case. They have seen plenty of terrorism, plenty of violence, and 
they know better. 
<p><i>Floyd J. McKay, a journalism professor at Western Washington University, 
is a former Jefferson Fellow. He spoke last week at the 35th anniversary of the 
Jefferson Fellowships.</i></p>
