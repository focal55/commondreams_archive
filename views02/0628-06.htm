<p>OH, MY ... God! Since no politician can afford to be seen as godless, no matter 
how completely they lean on the everlasting arms of lobbyists, they rushed to 
fax machines to be the first to cast stones at the ruling Wednesday by the 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel held that the phrase ''one nation 
under God'' makes the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional.
<P>''Ridiculous!'' said President Bush, according to spokesman Ari Fleischer.</P>
<P>''Nuts!'' said Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat.</P>
<P>''Senseless!'' said Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman.</P>
<P>''Stupid!'' said Senate Republican leader Trent Lott.</P>
<P>''Our Founding Fathers must be spinning in their graves!'' said Republican 
Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri.</P>
<P>''Junk justice!'' said New York's Governor George Pataki.</P>
<P>If one little atheist family is capable of creating such panic, the next thing 
you know, these politicians will send gravediggers to Appleton, Wis., to exhume 
Senator Joseph McCarthy. During McCarthy's Red Scare of the 1950s, 60 percent 
of Americans, in research by Harvard sociologist Samuel Stouffer, believed that 
atheists should not be allowed to give a public speech. That percentage was similar 
to the percentage who believed that a communist should not speak.</P>
<P>Contrary to Bond's romantic rhetoric about the Founding Fathers, ''under God'' 
was added to the Pledge by Congress only in 1954. It was the brainchild of the 
Knights of Columbus, which was doing its part to smoke out ''godless communists.'' 
In the 1950s, even God had leaned on the everlasting arms of lobbyists.</P>
<P>Nearly five decades later, atheist Michael Newdow of Sacramento sued his school 
district and the federal government after his second-grade daughter was forced 
to say the pledge. The suit was originally thrown out by a federal judge. Newdow 
appealed, saying ''nobody should be made to feel like an outsider.'' On Wednesday, 
Newdow won in the 9th Circuit, with Judge Alfred Goodwin writing for a three-judge 
panel that ''one nation under God'' was just as objectionable as saying one nation 
under Jesus, Vishnu, Zeus, or even under ''no god.''</P>
<P>Newdow's victory was short-lived. Yesterday, after all the expressions of outrage, 
Goodwin stayed the panel's ruling indefinitely. </P>
<P>No wonder. Hours after the ruling the Senate had passed a resolution, 99-0, 
to defend ''under God.'' Lott attacked the judges, saying that anyone ''who would 
make this kind of decision is bad for America.'' Senators screamed that it might 
mean we cannot mention God in patriotic songs, mint God onto money, or swear on 
the Bible in courts or political offices.</P>
<P>House Republican whip Tom DeLay said: ''It is sad that at a time when our country 
is coming together, this court is driving a wedge between us with their absurd 
ruling.''</P>
<P>''One nation under God'' has its own absurdities, being inserted into the pledge 
at a time that black people were lynched and girls and women were kept home. ''One 
nation under God'' came three and a half decades before the Americans With Disabilities 
Act and four decades before a presidential candidate would openly go to a gay 
and lesbian fund-raiser.</P>
<P>After the terrorist attacks, the singing of ''God Bless America'' fell off-key 
as the weeks passed. On a planet full of deadly conflicts, AIDS, and vast poverty, 
asking God to bless only America sounds a bit self-centered. Asking God to bless 
only America when we are asking the globe for help us in the fight against terrorism 
is arrogant. Michael Jackson once sang, ''We Are the World,'' but American politicians 
do not say ''God Bless the World.'' </P>
<P>Instead of being seen as a wedge of division, the 9th Circuit ruling gave Americans 
an opportunity to rethink the pledge. No matter the bad that has been done, either 
behind the flag or in the name of God, the pledge in the abstract is a declaration 
of optimism. When we say ''liberty and justice for all,'' many of us know quite 
well that generations of power brokers have spent the vast majority of the nation's 
two and a quarter centuries denying it to millions of its citizens. That does 
not stop us from wishing for it. </P>
<P>The clear and universal optimism implied in the wish should not be clouded 
by religious rituals. In a nation that so easily decries Muslim ''radicals'' or 
''fanatics,'' what else could you call the congressional spewing of ''stupid!'' 
''senseless!'' ''absurd!'' and ''nuts!'' but a fanaticism all its own? Not one 
senator had a kind thing to say about Newdow's constitutional rights. The individual 
was trampled in the lawmakers' dash to occupy the front pew of pontification.</P>
<P>Instead of the panicked echoes of McCarthy that would keep ''under God,'' we 
might do better with phrases that everyone can draw upon that speak to our organic 
history. My wife came up with, ''one nation, from many.'' I offer, ''one nation, 
of glorious diversity,'' ''one nation, born of inequality,'' and ''one nation, 
willing to struggle.'' Many of you surely have better ones. Newdow's courage reminds 
us that the Pledge of Allegiance itself is organic. In 1954, the issue was less 
about truly declaring a nation under God than shouting, ''One nation ... oh my 
God, the Commies are coming!''</P>
