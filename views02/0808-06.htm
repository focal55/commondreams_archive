<p>There is something almost comical about the prospect of George Bush waging 
war on another nation because that nation has defied international law. Since 
Bush came to office, the United States government has torn up more international 
treaties and disregarded more UN conventions than the rest of the world has in 
20 years. 
<P>It has scuppered the biological weapons convention while experimenting, illegally, 
with biological weapons of its own. It has refused to grant chemical weapons inspectors 
full access to its laboratories, and has destroyed attempts to launch chemical 
inspections in Iraq. It has ripped up the anti-ballistic missile treaty, and appears 
to be ready to violate the nuclear test ban treaty. It has permitted CIA hit squads 
to recommence covert operations of the kind that included, in the past, the assassination 
of foreign heads of state. It has sabotaged the small arms treaty, undermined 
the international criminal court, refused to sign the climate change protocol 
and, last month, sought to immobilize the UN convention against torture so that 
it could keep foreign observers out of its prison camp in Guantanamo Bay. Even 
its preparedness to go to war with Iraq without a mandate from the UN security 
council is a defiance of international law far graver than Saddam Hussein's non-compliance 
with UN weapons inspectors. 
<P>But the US government's declaration of impending war has, in truth, nothing 
to do with weapons inspections. On Saturday John Bolton, the US official charged, 
hilariously, with "arms control", told the Today program that "our policy ... 
insists on regime change in Baghdad and that policy will not be altered, whether 
inspectors go in or not". The US government's justification for whupping Saddam 
has now changed twice. At first, Iraq was named as a potential target because 
it was "assisting al-Qaida". This turned out to be untrue. Then the US government 
claimed that Iraq had to be attacked because it could be developing weapons of 
mass destruction, and was refusing to allow the weapons inspectors to find out 
if this were so. Now, as the promised evidence has failed to materialize, the 
weapons issue has been dropped. The new reason for war is Saddam Hussein's very 
existence. This, at least, has the advantage of being verifiable. It should surely 
be obvious by now that the decision to wage war on Iraq came first, and the justification 
later. 
<P>Other than the age-old issue of oil supply, this is a war without strategic 
purpose. The US government is not afraid of Saddam Hussein, however hard it tries 
to scare its own people. There is no evidence that Iraq is sponsoring terrorism 
against America. Saddam is well aware that if he attacks another nation with weapons 
of mass destruction, he can expect to be nuked. He presents no more of a threat 
to the world now than he has done for the past 10 years. 
<P>But the US government has several pressing domestic reasons for going to war. 
The first is that attacking Iraq gives the impression that the flagging "war on 
terror" is going somewhere. The second is that the people of all super-dominant 
nations love war. As Bush found in Afghanistan, whacking foreigners wins votes. 
Allied to this concern is the need to distract attention from the financial scandals 
in which both the president and vice-president are enmeshed. Already, in this 
respect, the impending war seems to be working rather well. 
<P>The United States also possesses a vast military-industrial complex that is 
in constant need of conflict in order to justify its staggeringly expensive existence. 
Perhaps more importantly than any of these factors, the hawks who control the 
White House perceive that perpetual war results in the perpetual demand for their 
services. And there is scarcely a better formula for perpetual war, with both 
terrorists and other Arab nations, than the invasion of Iraq. The hawks know that 
they will win, whoever loses. In other words, if the US were not preparing to 
attack Iraq, it would be preparing to attack another nation. The US will go to 
war with that country because it needs a country with which to go to war. 
<P>Tony Blair also has several pressing reasons for supporting an invasion. By 
appeasing George Bush, he placates Britain's rightwing press. Standing on Bush's 
shoulders, he can assert a claim to global leadership more credible than that 
of other European leaders, while defending Britain's anomalous position as a permanent 
member of the UN security council. Within Europe, his relationship with the president 
grants him the eminent role of broker and interpreter of power. 
<P>By invoking the "special relationship", Blair also avoids the greatest challenge 
any prime minister has faced since the second world war. This challenge is to 
recognize and act upon the conclusion of any objective analysis of global power: 
namely that the greatest threat to world peace is not Saddam Hussein, but George 
Bush. The nation that in the past has been our firmest friend is becoming instead 
our foremost enemy. 
<P>As the US government discovers that it can threaten and attack other nations 
with impunity, it will surely soon begin to threaten countries that have numbered 
among its allies. As its insatiable demand for resources prompts ever bolder colonial 
adventures, it will come to interfere directly with the strategic interests of 
other quasi-imperial states. As it refuses to take responsibility for the consequences 
of the use of those resources, it threatens the rest of the world with environmental 
disaster. It has become openly contemptuous of other governments and prepared 
to dispose of any treaty or agreement that impedes its strategic objectives. It 
is starting to construct a new generation of nuclear weapons, and appears to be 
ready to use them pre-emptively. It could be about to ignite an inferno in the 
Middle East, into which the rest of the world would be sucked. 
<P>The United States, in other words, behaves like any other imperial power. Imperial 
powers expand their empires until they meet with overwhelming resistance. 
<P>For Britain to abandon the special relationship would be to accept that this 
is happening. To accept that the US presents a danger to the rest of the world 
would be to acknowledge the need to resist it. Resisting the United States would 
be the most daring reversal of policy a British government has undertaken for 
over 60 years. 
<P>We can resist the US neither by military nor economic means, but we can resist 
it diplomatically. The only safe and sensible response to American power is a 
policy of non-cooperation. Britain and the rest of Europe should impede, at the 
diplomatic level, all US attempts to act unilaterally. We should launch independent 
efforts to resolve the Iraq crisis and the conflict between Israel and Palestine. 
And we should cross our fingers and hope that a combination of economic mismanagement, 
gangster capitalism and excessive military spending will reduce America's power 
to the extent that it ceases to use the rest of the world as its doormat. Only 
when the US can accept its role as a nation whose interests must be balanced with 
those of all other nations can we resume a friendship that was once, if briefly, 
founded upon the principles of justice.
