<p>Saddam is bad.
<p> "Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been 
subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution, and torture 
by beating and burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilition and rape," President 
George W. Bush told the United Nations in seeking to push Saddam Hussein out of 
Iraq.
<p> The evildoers are everywhere.
<p> Mass graves are bad.
<p> Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights uncovered one in Afghanistan in January. 
The United States' chief ally in Northern Afghanistan, the warlord Gen. Abdul 
Rashid Dostum, appears to have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds, if 
not more than a thousand, war prisoners he was rounding up on behalf of U.S. forces 
and transporting to the Sheberghan prison.
<p> They were stuffed into sealed cargo containers and left to asphyxiate. Before 
death, they'd licked each others' sweat and bitten off their fingertips or torn 
into their own arms and legs - and those of others - in a desperate search for 
fluid. Physicians for Human Rights discovered what they believe is the prisoners' 
mass grave in Dasht-e-Leili. 
<p> The Pentagon says no American personnel were involved in, or aware of, the 
mass deaths, though Americans were nearby processing prisoners who arrived in 
similar containers. No one in the U.S. government has asked for an investigation 
into whether forces working for the Americans committed what could well be a war 
crime. The Pentagon has rebuffed requests that the gravesite at least be secured 
to preserve evidence for a future inquiry.
<p> Security forces that use methods of torture that include "beating, whipping, 
electric shock and rape" are bad.
<p> The U.S. State Department thinks so. That is what it said about Indonesia 
in its April report on human rights around the globe. Security forces in the province 
of Aceh, where separatists are battling the government, routinely resort to thuggery 
of this sort. It so happens these techniques bear a certain similarity to those 
practiced by Saddam Hussein and are so irksome to the American president.
<p> But in July the State Department said not to worry, at least not in Indonesia. 
It entered a lawsuit brought by supporters of laborers in Aceh who accuse Exxon 
Mobil Corp. of having knowledge of torture and abuse, because the oil company 
hired Indonesian government forces to protect its facilities.
<p> The State Department, reversing the government's previous refusal to get involved 
in similar lawsuits, suggested the judge stop this suit from going forward because 
it might harm the Indonesian government and interfere with the war on terror. 
The department also warned the suit might "further discourage foreign investment, 
particularly in extractive industries." (Translation: the oil industry). In remote 
and unstable areas, these enterprises "require security protection," the department 
legal adviser's letter said.
<p> Uzbekistan's president is brutal, and very bad.
<p> The State Department human rights report says the former Soviet republic now 
"is an authoritarian state with limited civil rights . . . Both police and the 
National Security Services routinely tortured, beat and otherwise mistreated detainees 
to obtain confessions . . . Police also used suffocation, electric shock, rape 
and other sexual abuse. Neither the severity nor frequency of torture appeared 
to have decreased during the year."
<p> What increased was American aid. It tripled to $160 million, the payoff for 
allowing U.S. military staging areas for the war in neighboring Afghanistan. President 
Islam Karimov was welcomed to the White House. In July, Treasury Secretary Paul 
O'Neill traveled to Tashkent and praised Karimov's "efficient leadership."
<p> Bush has singled out one despot for removal.
<p> He says he has many reasons for invading Iraq. Without a look at some secret 
new evidence the administration may or may not have about Saddam Hussein's arsenal, 
it is not possible to find truth. That is how the White House wants it.
<p> But offering Saddam Hussein's egregious human rights record as reason for 
war does not convince. To the contrary, it is such flamboyant hypocrisy that it 
invites contempt.
