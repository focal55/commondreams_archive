As George W. Bush heads into the congressional campaign season he faces the



first major election test of his presidency. This fall is the Democrats' 

first post-2000 test, as well. Bush plans to hit the campaign trail soon in a

bid 

to return the Republican Party to full control of Congress. What do

Democrats 

plan? 

<p>

A year ago this week, fourteen representatives led by the Congressional

Black 

Caucus, stood up and objected to the formal registration of the 2000 

Electoral College vote. One after the other they rose in opposition to the 

rubber-stamping of an election result that required the throwing out of more



than 175,000 disproportionately African-American and overwhelmingly

Democratic 

Florida votes. 
<p>Al Gore -- in his position as president of the Senate -- 

ruled the fourteen out of order. House rules require a signature from a 

senator and no senator was willing to join the CBC's protest. (Incidentally,

there are no 

Black senators in the U.S. Senate.) The election was over and done with, but

electoral reform topped the Democrats list of priorities, the Gore/Liberman

team told the 

public.

<p>

On the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Bush vs. Gore, the House



by a 363 to 63 passed a bill that was widely hailed in the press as 

"Election Overhaul." "House Approves Election Overhaul," read the Washington



Post headline (12-13-01). The Ney-Hoyer bill (hammered out by 

Republican Robert Ney (Ohio) and Democrat Steny Hoyer (Md.) would appropriate 

funds for upgrading voting machines and replacing punch-ballots if counties 

were so inclined. 

<p>

"It's less than what we'd like it to be, but it's headed in the right 

direction," Congressional Black Caucus Chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.) 

told Working Assets Radio Monday. Good enough -- but an "overhaul" it is not.

<p>

"Nothing has changed. Absolutely nothing," Bob Fertik of Democrats.com told 

Working Assets. "175,000 votes in Florida were never counted [in 2000.] Nationally, 6

million 

were not counted. What's changed is that the House passed a very weak bill 

that has not passed the Senate and even if it did pass, it wouldn't change 

anything," said Fertik. The bill offers money to counties to upgrade, but it



doesn't make upgrading mandatory. 

<p>

"There are plenty of counties out there that have no inclination to make any



change and there's nothing in the law that would make them," Fertik

concluded.

<p>

Any suggestion that Congress should finally create a fair voting system in 

the United States is certainly no more advanced than it was a year ago. To 

quote from an <a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=10383" target="new">essay of December 2000</a>: 



"While African Americans in huge numbers know there was massive voter fraud,



harassment and intimidation a la Jim Crow, the Democratic Party's white 

top-dogs have resolutely refused to talk about voting rights, race or

racism. Why? For fear it will hurt them in the court of public opinion?

Among white 

swing voters and southern Democrats? Already hurting in all of those places,



they're trifling with one of the few solid voting blocks they've got left 

(Blacks, Latinos, Jews).

<p>

"The conditions are ripe for a pro-democracy movement," I wrote a year ago. "A moment, at least: this is  

it."

<p>

Last year's voter protests built a multi-racial coalition that advocated a 

nonpartisan election commission, standardized voting procedures and federal 

enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Some cranked up their demands for 

instant-runoff voting or some form of proportional representation, so that 

small parties (and minority constituencies) could build support for their 

issues without throwing elections to their foes. Since then some voting 

machines have changed, but where's the justice movement? 
<p>Is your passion for



democracy, like the CBC's was in January 2000, running hot? Or not? If the 

latter -- what do you think -- is cool as a Senatorial cucumber any way to

be 

a Democrat?
