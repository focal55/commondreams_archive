<P>The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), 
has announced that he plans to hold hearings on Iraq starting tomorrow.
<p> Given Sen. Biden's open embrace of regime removal in Baghdad, there is a real 
risk that any such hearings may devolve into a political cover for the passing 
of a congressional resolution authorizing the Bush administration to wage war 
on Iraq. Such hearings would represent a travesty for the American people.
<p> Sen. Biden would do well to focus his attention on the case for war against 
Iraq. Discussion should ensue on both Iraq's potential and, more importantly, 
known weapons of mass destruction capability.
<p> On Sept. 3, 1998, I provided <a href="http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1998_h/s980903sr.htm" target="_new">detailed 
testimony</a> before a joint hearing of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign 
Relations Committees concerning the circumstances of my resignation as a chief 
inspector of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM). The testimony also 
dealt with Iraq's obligation to be disarmed of its proscribed weapons of mass 
destruction capability in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions. 
In the nearly four years that have passed, much has been made of this presentation, 
especially by those who seek to use my words to reinforce the current case for 
war against Iraq.
<p> My testimony was an accurate, balanced assessment in full keeping with the 
facts available. As of September, 1998, Iraq had not been fully disarmed. UNSCOM 
was pursuing important investigatory leads concerning (among others) Iraq's VX 
nerve-agent program, disposition of biological bombs and warheads, and ongoing 
procurement activity in the field of ballistic missiles with potential application 
for use in systems with a range greater than the permitted 150 kilometers.
<p> Iraqi obstruction prevented UNSCOM from fully discharging its mandated tasks. 
We could account for 90 percent to 95 percent of Iraq's proscribed weaponry, versus 
the 100 percent required by the Security Council. Based upon an assessment of 
intelligence information available to UNSCOM, once inspection activity had ceased 
in Iraq, the government of Saddam Hussein could be in a position to resume aspects 
of his mass weapons programs within a period of six months. While most of this 
would be related to organizational realignment of dispersed capability, some small-scale 
weapons production capacity could potentially be reconstituted.
<p> The potential for Iraq to restart its programs, however, did not, and does 
not today, mean that such reconstitution would be inevitable. The danger in the 
collapse of the weapons-inspection program lay in the elimination of a major obstacle 
to any such decision being made by Baghdad, as well as the means to detect any 
related actions. As such, I spent a great deal of my testimony speaking of the 
need to maintain a robust regime of inspections that objectively implemented the 
mandate of the Security Council.
<p> While much attention has been given lately to my discussion of the potential 
threat posed by Iraq, little has been made of what I then considered to be the 
main crux of the issue: the collapse of the UNSCOM inspection regime, and the 
absolute need to get UN weapons inspectors back to work in Iraq. The current war-like 
posturing of the United States towards Iraq, centered on unsubstantiated speculation 
about the grave and imminent risk posed by Iraq's current alleged weapons of mass 
destruction capabilities, makes the issue of inspections as relevant today as 
they were in 1998.
<p> In 1998, I told the Senate that UNSCOM had a job to do and we expected to 
be able to carry it out in accordance within the framework of relevant Security 
Council resolutions. I emphasized the danger of entering into inspection activity 
that lacked any compelling arms control reason, noting that in doing so we would 
be heading down a slippery slope of confrontation that was not backed by our mandate. 
I pointed out the importance of the United States keeping commitments made to 
the Security Council. This meant not only holding Iraq accountable for its actions, 
but also preserving the integrity of the overall inspection operation so that 
any potential issue of confrontation would be about Iraq's non-compliance, versus 
issues not expressly covered by the mandate of the Council. I reiterated again 
and again the harm done to the inspection process by the continued interference 
by the United States.
<p> Unfortunately my warnings were not heeded. In December, 1998, continued manipulation 
of the UNSCOM inspection process by the United States led to a fabricated crisis 
that had nothing to do with legitimate disarmament. This crisis led to the United 
States ordering UNSCOM inspectors out of Iraq two days before the start of Operation 
Desert Fox, a 72-hour bombing campaign executed by the United States and Great 
Britain that lacked Security Council authority. Worse, the majority of the targets 
bombed were derived from the unique access the UNSCOM inspectors had enjoyed in 
Iraq, and had more to do with the security of Saddam Hussein than weapons of mass 
destruction. Largely because of this, Iraq has to date refused to allow inspectors 
back to work. The ensuing uncertainty has created an atmosphere that teeters on 
the brink of war.
<p> Through his propossed hearings, Sen. Biden has an historic opportunity to 
serve the greater good of the United States. If a substantiated case can be made 
that Iraq possesses actual weapons of mass destruction, then the debate is over 
- the justification for war is clear. But, to date the Bush administration has 
been unable - or unwilling - to back up its rhetoric concerning the Iraqi threat 
with any substantive facts.
<p> For Sen. Biden's Iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used 
to invoke a modern-day Gulf of Tonkin resolution-equivalent for Iraq, his committee 
will need to ask hard questions - and demand hard facts - concerning the real 
nature of the weapons threat posed by Iraq. Void of that, it is impossible to 
speak of Iraq as a grave and imminent risk to American national security worthy 
of war. Therefore, it is imperative that the Senate discuss means other than war 
for dealing with this situation - including the need to resume UN-led weapons 
inspections in Iraq.
