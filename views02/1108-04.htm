<p>The mid-term elections are over.  After spending hundreds of 
millions of business dollars, the Republicans now control the Senate and 
hold on to the House of Representatives.  It is amazing that the 
Democrats did not do worse.  They had decided months ago on a strange 
strategy -- that they were going to defeat the Republicans by not 
criticizing their belligerent leader, George W. Bush.
<p>In their ads, literature and debates between Senatorial and 
Representative candidates, mention of Mr. Bush by them was to praise not 
to challenge, or to expose the hypocrisy, and the damage to American 
workers and consumers by this corporation President.
<p>Listening to the debate from around the country on C-Span radio, I 
was astonished to see Democratic candidates in tight races eager to show 
their support for Bush's 2001 tax cut for the wealthy, for the 
give-a-way war resolution authority on Iraq, and for Bush's federal 
drive to take over the historical role of the states in personal injury 
law by restricting Americans' right to their full day in court.
<p>And what did Senate Democrat candidates such as Jean Shaheen in New 
Hampshire and Senator Max Cleland of Georgia get for their support of 
President Bush?  Why he roared into their states on Air Force One and 
campaigned against them, as he did against other Democrats who voted 
with him on these and other Republican litmus paper tests.
<p>The morning after election day, reporters asked Senator majority leader, Tom 
Daschle why the Democrats lost? He replied, because the Democrats were "up against 
a very popular President." That's a self-fulfilling point. Asked the same question, 
Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe answered: "Because they [the Republicans] 
outspent us." But it was Republican House speaker who gave the accurate response: 
"Because the Democrats did not have a message." 
<p>At a time of rising unemployment, a shaky economy, and growing 
Republican deficits, it would seem that the Democrats had 
opportunities.  Yet while the Republicans were shamelessly touting 
ending the estate tax for the 4000 estates a year that are in the 
multi-million dollar category, the Democrats were not highlighting the 
desperate need for raising the federal minimum wage (now about a third 
less in purchasing power than it was in 1968!) and extending 
unemployment compensation benefits.
<p>Most Democrats, with the prominent exception of the late Senator Paul Wellstone, 
took a dive on making Republican softness on corporate crime a major issue, coupled 
with solid reform proposals to crackdown on corporate scandals that stole billions 
from pension funds and 401ks and cost many jobs. (See <a href="http://www.Citizenworks.org" target="_new">Citizenworks.org</a>). 
<p>Namby-pamby was the Democratic routine on the increasing millions of 
Americans without health care coverage and on the staggering 
inefficiency, waste and greed of many giant HMOs and the drug industry.
<p>Although the Democrats had in their possession finely tuned economic 
stimulus plans, they tied their own by declining to go after a bloated 
military budget (now half of the U.S. government's entire 
non-discretionary budget) and the tens of billions of dollars in yearly 
corporate welfare subsidies and handouts.
<p>Instead, the Democrats' economic agenda was the raising of big bucks 
from business interests -- a sure way to silence championing the 
peoples' necessities.
<p>When the Democratic Party adopts a look-a-like strategy vis-a-vis the Republican 
Party, some of their voters may prefer the real thing and vote Republican. After 
all, only a shift of less than three hundred thousand votes in key states would 
have given the Democrats control of both Houses of Congress. 
<p>Amidst the din of endlessly repeated political television ads, it 
wasn't made very clear that the Democrats were going after the 
Republicans on down home consumer protection issues, such as insurance 
and food safety and affordable housing.  Environmental positions 
regarding cleaner air and water were not prominent either.
<p>Lessons for the future?  Don't give your major political opponents a 
free ride between and before elections.  Challenge the corporate 
takeover of elections, including the sudden surge of political 
television advertising paid directly by industries like the big 
price-gouging drug companies.  And get down to the neighborhood level 
with visible stands for the people.
<p>Otherwise the Democrats will become even better at electing very bad 
Republicans.
