<p>When the history of our time is written, American society will be remembered 
less for materialism than for its incredibly short attention span. As a culture, 
we lurch from trend to trend and scandal to scandal to scandal with almost no 
consciousness of what happened last month or last year, and even less of what 
happened a decade or generation ago. 
<p>Take, for instance, the September 11 foresight scandal. For a few weeks in 
May and early June, the front pages of ever major newspaper carried chilling accounts 
of high-level terrorism warnings ignored, with determined nonchalance, by President 
Bush and his administration. These warnings were not "noise" or "chatter," as 
administration apologists like to call them. Among them was an intelligence summary 
given to National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice on June 28 of last year, which 
stated "it is highly likely that a significant al Qaeda attack is in the near 
future, within several weeks." A week later, just a month and a day before President 
Bush's briefly infamous briefing on possible al Qaeda hijackings, Richard Clarke 
-- the government's top counterterrorism official -- warned that "something spectacular 
is going to happen here, and it's going to happen soon." 
<p>President Bush, confronted with these dire predictions, decided to take a "working 
vacation" in Texas. "I knew [Osama bin Laden] was a menace and I knew he was a 
problem," Bush later said. "But I didn't feel that sense of urgency." 
<p>However, President Bush certainly felt a sense of urgency when faced with allegations 
of negligence. After news of the August 6 briefing went public, the administration 
was quick to label questions as "incendiary," and insisted it was unthinkable 
that September 11 could have been foreseen or prevented. Soon afterwards they 
admitted that it was quite thinkable, and made a tactical decision to abandon 
confrontational rhetoric and encourage a limited inquiry into intelligence mistakes. 
<p>By shifting attention from its own possible failures to those of the intelligence 
community, the Bush administration was able to transform the debate. FBI Director 
Robert Mueller, who took office on September 5 after Bush left the position filled 
on an interim basis all summer, was paraded before the media as a decoy and scapegoat. 
Shortly afterwards, an investigation was formally convened -- not an independent 
commission, as many had called for, but a Congressional inquiry to be held in 
secret. Co-chairing the investigation is Porter J. Goss, a Florida Republican 
and former CIA footman. His description of the first meeting set a disturbingly 
convivial, back-slapping tone: "The mood was very positive, and refreshing, especially 
in comparison to the finger pointing that is going on in other circles." 
<p>The loyal opposition, both Congressionally and in the body politic, accepted 
this half-measure with a minimum of struggle, electing instead to concentrate 
on capturing the House in the November elections. At the time it was a very risky 
strategy, conceding much at a critical moment. But now that corporations are dropping 
like flies, with the economy victim to fraud of epic proportions, things are looking 
grim for Republicans, who have always been the party of Big Business and have 
as their leader a President who promised to run the country like a corporation. 
<p>All of a sudden, the Teflon coating which shielded Bush from a mind-blowing 
succession of scandals -- any of which would have sunk most Presidents -- appears 
to be wearing thin. The election coup, secret energy policies, a budget surplus 
turned overnight into deficits, flagrant links to Enron, gross incompetence in 
the Middle East, an about-face on global warming -- on all these issues, Americans 
who bothered to pay attention at all were basically content to accept administration 
rhetoric as truth. But the economy is a different matter. 
<p>According to a July 20 Newsweek poll, President Bush's approval ratings have 
fallen to 66%, their lowest level since September 10. Fewer than fifty percent 
of Americans "are satisfied with the way things are going in general." As conservative 
writer Christopher Caldwell wrote in a scathing New York Press article, "What 
kills the President is that every time Harken comes up, Democrats get to retell 
the story of how he made his money. And this, basically . . . is the story of 
a man who has been rewarded for repeated failures by having money shot at him 
through a fire hose. It is the story of a man who talks with a straight face about 
having 'earned' a fortune . . . without ever having done an honest day's work 
in his life." 
<p>When your own supporters start talking like that, it's time to worry. It's 
also time for the loyal opposition to take a stand -- and how better to do so 
than by finally challenging John Ashcroft, that ultimate bogeyman of both liberals 
and traditional conservatives, who until now has been protected by Bush's aura 
of impenetrability? 
<p>The case for Ashcroft's removal could be easily made with information already 
documented. His negligence before September 11 is a matter of public record -- 
rejecting increased funding for counterterrorism, proposing cuts for state and 
local counterterrorist programs, and ignoring an internal report detailing the 
near-complete unpreparedness of the FBI for terrorist attacks that were already 
viewed as imminent. The solutions he has championed since then, particularly the 
deregulation of the FBI, are not just violations of Constitutional rights. They 
are demonstrably unrelated to winning the War on Terrorism. 
<p>Dismay with Ashcroft is spreading even on the right. Grover Norquist, a conservative 
strategist and president of Americans for Tax Reform, claims that Ashcroft's "religious 
base is now quite troubled by what he's done." House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
a Texas Republican, recently rejected the Terrorism Information and Prevention 
System (TIPS), an Ashcroft brainchild that would have enlisted 24 million Americans 
to act as federal informants, empowered under the Patriot Act to investigate and 
report any "suspicious" behavior. 
<p>There is ample reason to believe that John Ashcroft's continued service is 
not in America's best interest, and it is imperative to make the case now, before 
momentum is lost, and before the Bush administration manages to force through 
its deeply flawed plans for a Department of Homeland Security. For all that the 
crashing economy and Bush's corporate links appear to weaken the President, he 
has proved enormously resourceful. That America might soon return its natural 
sleepwalking state, albeit with smaller bank accounts and heightened retirement 
worries, is depressingly likely. 
<p>Though the September 11 scandal has been compared to Watergate, it seems destined 
to end up like the Iran-Contra affair. Despite having sold weapons to our enemies, 
and channeling the funds to Nicaraguan death squads, many of the perpetrators 
went on to political prominence; and Ronald Reagan, under whose watch it all happened, 
has been deified by the revisionist right. 
<p>The Bush administration may resist public demands that it learn from mistakes 
made with America's safety, but it will certainly not fail to learn from its own 
mistakes in scandal management. The loyal opposition must act now. In the year 
2002, Richard Nixon would not be impeached.
