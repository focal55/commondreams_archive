<p>NEW YORK</b> </a> -- A Thai government planner once tried to explain to me 
why people all over Bangkok were getting away with drilling illegal wells, pulling 
the city ever deeper into the bog on which it rests. &quot;We are a soft state,&quot; 
he said with a wry smile.
<p>It was a nod to the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal and his seminal 
1968 book &quot;Asian Drama.&quot; Almost everywhere in what was then proudly 
called the Third World, what grabbed attention was Myrdal's cautionary take on 
what happens in countries where breaking rules and flouting laws is a cultural 
norm. He focused particularly on South Asia.
<p>Too bad that Myrdal, who died in 1987, is not with us today. A &quot;soft state,&quot; 
he wrote, is one where &quot;governments require extraordinarily little of their 
citizens&quot; and &quot;even those obligations that do exist are enforced inadequately, 
if at all.&quot; He thought that a low level of what he called &quot;social discipline&quot; 
divided emerging South Asian countries from Western nations at a similar, earlier 
stage of industrialization.
<p>What would Myrdal have made of reports that have been piling up in recent years 
about Americans' failures to police themselves? Would he have detected a &quot;Third 
Worlding&quot; of America? Do Indian and American democracies have more in common 
than we think? This all has little or nothing to do with morality or religion; 
put that red herring to rest. The epidemic feels more like some kind of civic 
exhaustion.
<p>In small American towns, it means nobody volunteering for the volunteer fire 
department, or going to crucial community meetings, not to mention bothering to 
vote or fighting to strengthen public schools.
<p>In developing countries, a fatal gap in the social and political order is often 
the lack of grassroots self-government. Traveling with a Pakistani candidate for 
Parliament a decade ago, I saw people plead at campaign stops for help with health 
problems, land disputes, personal feuds and consumer complaints. &quot;They have 
no one else to go to,&quot; she said. &quot;There is no local authority here to 
help them.&quot; In the poorest countries, a huge percentage of privileged children 
who get a good education go to private or religious schools, because public education 
has atrophied if it ever really existed. Would Myrdal fault the U.S. Supreme Court 
and the voucher lobby for steering America in the same direction?
<p>Americans build bigger houses and higher walls. Almost any Third World city 
has, arguably, more gated communities than the suburbs of New York, and many more 
walls keeping out the poor. Is that America's model?
<p>In the wake of terrorist attacks on the United States, a portrait of inattention, 
small-minded squabbling and downright slovenliness in law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies has been emerging. Anyone in law or journalism who has tried to pursue 
a criminal investigation in most developing nations knows that there is almost 
never a resolution, or even enough evidence to make a judgment, usually because 
of shoddy police work.
<p>Most recently, we learned that American banks, eager for profits and not too 
fussy about checking identities, have been allowing suspected terrorists to move 
money around at will. Anything-goes banking helped deliver the Southeast Asian 
economic crises five years ago.
<p>And then there is crony capitalism. That and the now all too familiar laxity 
of regulators are primarily what sabotaged the economic progress of Asian tigers 
like Thailand and Indonesia, long before governments got bad advice, if it was 
bad advice, from the International Monetary Fund.
<p>Just after Myrdal dissected the soft state, the late Bernard D. Nossiter, a 
New York Times correspondent in India, was coming to some of the same conclusions. 
He noted that by the 1960s Indians were sounding alarms, as Americans are doing 
now. While writing his 1970 book &quot;Soft State: A Newspaperman's Chronicle 
of India,&quot; Nossiter found this now timeless and perhaps universally applicable 
passage in the Economic Times of Bombay:
<p>&quot;Indian democracy seems to be entering dangerous waters. The real danger 
is not military dictatorship or even chaos - India fortunately is too big for 
either - but apathy, cynicism, stagnation, shameless self-seeking.&quot;
