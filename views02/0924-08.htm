<p>Only a tone-deaf politician could fail to realize that there is much political 
hay to be made from the current bumper crop of corporate scandals. So, with control 
of the Senate at stake, candidates -- especially in tight races like Minnesota, 
Missouri, and Texas -- are slipping into the mantle of the reformer and doing 
all they can to squeeze their way into the crowded populist tent. 
<p> In Minnesota, where Democrat Sen. Paul Wellstone is being challenged by Republican 
Norm Coleman, the former mayor of St. Paul, the race has turned into a battle 
to see which candidate can paint himself as more pro-little guy. It's become Populist 
vs Populist. Or Populist 3 if you factor in Minnesota Green Party candidate and 
potential spoiler Ed McGaa. 
<p> It's a stance that comes naturally to Wellstone, who, since 1990, has been 
the Senate's reigning crusader against corporate influence over public policy. 
His latest TV spots legitimately portray him as "one of the toughest watchdogs 
in Washington," a politician who has consistently "stood up to the most powerful 
interests to fight for people." "You've got to put people first," says Wellstone 
in the ad. "You've got to know whose side you're on." 
<p> Hopping on the populist bandwagon, albeit a bit less gracefully, Coleman's 
campaign pronouncements are peppered with rhetoric that could have been torn from 
an old Eugene Debs stump speech: "Consumers and employees need the protection 
of the law against the greed and arrogance of the rich and powerful." Coleman 
has also tried to align himself with the cause of cheated investors: "I was a 
prosecutor and I have looked into the eyes of people who lost their life savings 
to white collar corporate crime. There should be no mercy for perpetrators of 
that crime." 
<p> The two candidates have repeatedly crossed swords over who has the sleaziest 
supporters -- always a recipe for real mudslinging, especially in a close race 
-- each attacking the other for accepting donations from people associated with 
scandal-plagued companies. Call it Guilt by Contribution. Wellstone's camp has 
slammed Coleman for raking in nearly $20,000 from corporations under investigation 
by Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Citigroup, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb and Reliant Energy, and for pocketing contributions from individuals with 
ties to WorldCom, Global Crossing, and Arthur Andersen. 
<p> Coleman has returned fire by touting the fact that, as a gesture of contrition, 
he donated the money he got from Global Crossing executives to, among other charities, 
the National Latino Peace Officers Association -- and by challenging Wellstone 
to do the same with money he received from Leo Hindery, the former CEO of Global 
Crossing. 
<p> Corporate connections have also played a central role in the Missouri Senate 
race, where Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan is locked in a tight contest with Republican 
former congressman Jim Talent. 
<p> Carnahan and her supporters have drawn blood by playing up Talent's most recent 
gig as a moderately talented $230,000-a-year corporate lobbyist, and by attacking 
his pro-fat cat voting record while serving in the House -- including his support 
of a federal loophole that allows super-rich Americans to renounce their citizenship 
as a way to avoid paying taxes. It doesn't help Talent's cause that during his 
time in Congress he was part of a group of young congressmen who dubbed themselves 
the "Lobster Tails" -- renowned for dining out at fancy restaurants on lobbyist's 
expense accounts. 
<p> In the finest tradition of American politics and schoolyards everywhere, Talent 
has responded to the attacks on his career as a lobbyist by finding a lobbyist 
of his own to smear -- making mud pies out of the fact that Roy Temple, Carnahan's 
chief of staff, worked as a lobbyist for MCI during the time it was acquired by 
the sleazoids at WorldCom. 
<p> Talent's buddies in the Missouri GOP have also joined the fray, running TV 
ads attacking Carnahan as a hypocrite in populist’s clothing for having accepted 
campaign cash from executives at Global Crossing -- including the ubiquitous Hindery 
-- "who bankrupted the company and cost the employees their jobs and life savings." 
The commercials fail to mention, however, that the Republican Senatorial Committee, 
which helped pay for the ad, also took money from Global Crossing. Maybe irony 
didn't score well in the committee’s focus group tests. 
<p> Deep in the heart of Texas, where Democrat Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas, 
and Republican John Cornyn, the state's attorney general, are vying to fill the 
seat of retiring Sen. Phil Gramm, the populist parade is also underway -- with 
both candidates stumbling into potholes they’ve dug for themselves. 
<p> After all, it's pretty hard to attack your opponent for being in the pocket 
of corrupt corporations, as both men have done, when you yourself are, well, let's 
just say more than a little familiar with the linty interior of those very same 
cash-lined pockets. I mean, how ludicrous is it to see Kirk trying to capitalize 
on the fact that, over the course of his political career, Cornyn has accepted 
$193,000 from Enron when Kirk spent much of the early 1990s working as a lobbyist 
for clients that included energy, tobacco and automobile companies -- and fighting 
against such consumer-friendly causes as cleaner-burning cars and harsher penalties 
for businesses that sell cigarettes to minors? It was no less ridiculous watching 
Cornyn trying to earn populist brownie points by donating an amount equal to his 
Enron haul to a fund that supports vanquished employees of the fallen energy giant 
-- but only after months of steadfastly refusing to do so. 
<p> Kirk even gave a populist twist to the hot issue of invading Iraq when he 
questioned Cornyn's full-throated support for sending troops on the grounds that 
those on the front lines of the fight would be disproportionately ethnic and poor. 
"I would be curious to see," he said, "if we would go to war without any thought 
of loss if the first half-million kids to go came from families who made $1 million." 
<p> I would bet we wouldn’t. As for me, I will be curious to see if the outpouring 
of populist rhetoric from Campaign 2002 will translate into substantive populist 
reforms when the 108th Congress convenes in January 2003. </i></p>
