<p>THIS IS AN open plea to young women. I know you think abortion rights have 
been won. I know you take for granted the right to choose when and whether to 
bear a child. But now those reproductive rights are under attack and it's your 
turn to carry the torch. It's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. It's 
time to organize and march in the streets. 
<P>I also understand why you feel complacent. We live in the most pro-choice state 
in the nation; we even have a constitutional amendment that would supersede any 
U.S. Supreme Court decision that strikes down a woman's right to abortion. 
<P>But such complacency is terribly shortsighted. You may move to another state. 
Abortion foes could start a campaign to repeal our state amendment. And President 
Bush will have the opportunity to nominate two or three new Supreme Court justices, 
who will decide the future of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that gave American 
women abortion rights. 
<P>"Even if Roe. vs. Wade is not overturned," says Carole Joffe, an expert on 
reproductive rights and visiting professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF, 
"there is much that Bush can do to eviscerate existing abortion rights. Extremist 
Bush appointees in the FDA will very likely attempt to restrict access to RU-486, 
the 'abortion pill,' as well as emergency contraception. John Ashcroft's Justice 
Department could refuse to prosecute those who commit acts of anti-abortion violence. 
These things will impact all California women." 
<P>You may not realize it, but the Bush administration has been waging a steady 
campaign to establish legal personhood for the fetus and to restrict women's reproductive 
rights both here and around the world: 
<P>-- The United States withheld $34 million from the U.N.'s Population Fund that 
offers contraceptive and reproductive services (but not abortions) to women in 
other countries. 
<P>-- The Bush administration recently joined Islamic fundamentalists and the 
Vatican in opposing the Program of Action adopted at the United Nation's Conference 
on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994 that sought to improve women's 
reproductive choices and educational opportunities. 
<P>-- Joined by Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Syria and the Vatican, the United States 
voted to oppose sex education to fight teen pregnancy and AIDS because it included 
the use of condoms. 
<P>-- New administration directives have given the unborn embryo health benefits 
(but not mothers or children once they're born) and endowed it with the same rights 
that protect other "human subjects" involved in scientific research. 
<P>-- The Republican-dominated Senate will now consider a slew of House-passed 
bills: the Unborn Victims of Violence Act (which gives legal status to a fetus 
hurt or killed when a federal crime is committed); and the Child Custody Protection 
Act (which makes it a crime to take a minor out-of-state for an abortion in violation 
of a state's parental notification laws). 
<P>Joffe rightfully worries that too many of us are oblivious to these attacks 
on reproductive rights. "If younger women, who have never experienced adult life 
without legal abortion, do not become active in the struggle to protect both the 
right and access to abortion, this essential component of women's health could 
be lost for generations to come." 
<P>So what can you do? Get informed, know your rights and act to protect them.

got no time to lose.</p>
