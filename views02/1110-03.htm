<p>British Member of Parliament George Galloway says that
a plan for the division of the Middle East is
circulating in the corridors of power on both sides of
the Atlantic.  In a recent interview, Galloway
asserted that ministers and eminent figures in the
British government are deliberating the partition of
the Middle East, harking back to the colonial
map-making in the first quarter of the 20th century
that established the modern nation-states of the
region.  An Anglo-American war against Iraq, he tells
me, could be the opening salvo in the break up of the
region.  Galloway, who met with Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad this August, states that the war aims of the
US and Britain go well beyond replacing the Iraqi
leader.  “They include a recasting of the entire
Middle East, the better to ensure the hegemony of the
big powers over the natural resources of the Middle
East and the safety and security of the vanguard of
imperialist interests in the area – the state of
Israel. And part of that is actually redrawing
boundaries.”  

<p>Galloway is privy to such information as he is the Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party Foreign Affairs Committee with close relations to Britain’s Ministry of Defense.  Galloway says that British ministers and former ministers are primarily focused on the break-up of Saudi Arabia and Iraq in the wake of an attack against Saddam Hussein, but are also discussing the possible partition of Egypt, the Sudan, Syria and Lebanon.  These officials have become taken with the realization that the borders of the Middle East are recent creations, dating back only to World War I when Britain and France divided the region between themselves.  Galloway adds, “There are many ways in which a new Sykes-Picot dispensation could be drawn up in the Middle East to guarantee another few decades of big power hegemony over the area.”  

<p>The Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, codified by the
League of Nations in 1920, parceled out the crumbling
Ottoman Empire extending over much of the Middle East
between Britain and France.  By the early 1920s
Britain, which as the reigning imperial power already effectively ruled Egypt, the Sudan, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar, made off with the lion’s share.  This divvying up of the region by imperial powers led to the creation of the states of Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq among others.  Under the aegis of Britain, the modern state of Saudi Arabia emerged in the late 1920s, absorbing the hitherto separate eastern, central and western regions – including the holy sites of Mecca and Medina – of what constitutes the country today.  

<p>The partition of the Middle East was partially driven
by the oil conglomerates of the time.  Britain pushed
through the interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company
(British Petroleum’s predecessor) and Royal Dutch
Shell, over American oil companies Exxon and Mobil by
means of the colonial mandate it had established
following WWI.  Jockeying over oil resulted in an
Anglo-French agreement giving Britain the northern
Iraqi province of Mosul.  This lead to in Iraq’s
modern boundaries, formed in 1921 when Britain
combined the three Ottoman provinces of Mosul, Baghdad
and Basra, which were predominantly Kurdish, Sunni and
Shi’a Muslim respectively.  

<p>Today British and American petroleum interests
dominate the scene once more, although Britain is
reduced to the role of junior partner.  The United
States and Britain are home to the four biggest
petroleum producers in the world – Exxon-Mobil,
Chevron-Texaco, British Petroleum-Amoco and Royal
Dutch-Shell – with the French-Italian TotalElfFina
following in fifth place.  While a massive upheaval in
the Middle East would hurt oil revenues initially, a
new constellation of power there could in the long run safeguard the interests of the petroleum conglomerates from the present instability of the region.  While the US government has been considering alternate sources of oil in the Caspian Sea area, Russia and Africa, analysts admit that none of these compare to the known riches of the Persian Gulf.  

<p>Not surprisingly then, if hawks on both sides of the
Atlantic have their way, Saudi Arabia would be at the
core of a hegemonically reshaped Middle East.  Saudi
Arabia alone contains a quarter of the world’s
petroleum reserves and is one of the only countries
able to increase production to meet rising demand for
oil, expected to grow by fifty percent in the next two
decades.  Yet Saudi Arabia is no longer seen by the US
and UK governments as a trustworthy ally, and
certainly not one on which they can afford to be so
dependent, given the kingdom’s internal vulnerability
and its sponsorship of Islamic fundamentalist
insurgents (Saudi nationals comprising fifteen of the
nineteen September 11th hijackers) – even though such
patronage had been coordinated by the United States in
earlier, happier times.  

<p>“I think the United States in particular has lost
confidence in the ruling family in Saudi Arabia, so
far as their interests are concerned,” Galloway
maintains.  “They realize that the radicalization of
the Saudi Arabian population has proceeded at very
great pace, has reached very great depths,
particularly amongst young people.”  The United States
and Britain are fearful that the unreliable House of
Saud will be overthrown and that the new anti-American
rulers will shut off the flow of oil.  “The United
States is afraid that one day they’ll wake up and a
Khomeini type – or be it Wahhabi Sunni Khomeini –
revolution would have occurred, and they would have
lost everything in the country.”  The British Foreign
Office has warned that dissent, bubbling up from a
dissatisfied population that sympathizes with Osama
bin Laden and seethes at the pro-American stance of
the ruling elite, has reached the point where the
country risks being taken over by al-Qaeda.  

<p>“Saudi Arabia could easily be two if not three
countries,” Galloway says, summarizing the
neo-imperialist position discussed in British
government circles, “which would have the helpful
bonus of avoiding foreign forces having to occupy the
holiest places in Islam, when they’re only interested
really in oil wells in the eastern part of the
country.”  According to him, the US troops based
throughout Saudi Arabia could be withdrawn from the
areas containing Mecca and Medina, the most hallowed
sites in the Islamic world, where US military presence
is a source of great resentment for many Saudis.  

<p>Instead the soldiers would occupy only the Eastern
Province of the country, which borders on the Persian
Gulf and is inhabited by Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a
minority.  This area contains the major oilfields,
including the largest oilfield in the world, Ghawar,
as well as the industrial centers of the kingdom. 
“The theorists of this idea have fastened on to the
fact that a very substantial proportion of the
population in the Eastern Province, where the oil is,
are Shi’ite Muslims with no particular affection for
the ruling Wahhabi clique who form the House of Saud.”
 Galloway adds that for the first time, leaders in the
West are becoming concerned with the human rights of
the Shi’a population, which “now that they coincide
with Western interests, are moving up the agenda.”

<p>In the United States, those in interlocking circles
around the Bush administration have been calling for
the dismemberment of Saudi Arabia.  This past July, an
analyst from the US government-funded Rand Corporation presented a briefing in Defense Secretary Rumsfeld’s private conference room titled “Taking Saudi Out of Arabia,” which advised the assembled luminaries of the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board that the US government should demand Saudi Arabia stop supporting hostile fundamentalist movements and curtail the airing of anti-US and anti-Israel statements, or its oilfields and financial assets would be seized.  A month later Max Singer, co-founder of the rightwing US think tank the Hudson Institute, gave a presentation to the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment, in which he counseled the US government to forge a “Muslim Republic of East Arabia” out of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.  

<p>Whether the imperialist strategem of the
neo-conservatives comes to pass remains to be seen. 
What is apparent, however, is that the potential for
such a cynical adventure to go wrong would be quite
high.  Colonial undertakings have a tendency to not
work out as expected, even if the fantasies of
draughtsman in the Pentagon and Britain’s Whitehall
are implement through “native” proxies.  This is
especially the case when the populations of the areas
to be shaped, rather than viewing the US as deliverers
of a pipedream of “democracy,” are intensely hostile
to the imperial designs of the West.
