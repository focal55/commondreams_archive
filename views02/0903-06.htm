<p><i>Especially since September 11th military and security spending has soared 
in the western world. And now there's the possibility of a war against Iraq. Miriam 
Pemberton is a research fellow at the <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/" target="_new">Institute 
of Policy Studies</a> in Washington. It specializes in peace and security issues. 
On Commentary she says another Gulf War threatens to throw the world into a recession.</i> 
<p>Apart from all the other reasons to be nervous about a U.S. invasion of Iraq, 
are the potential shocks it might deliver to an already shaky world economy. During 
the buildup to the last Gulf War - between the time Iraq invaded Kuwait and the 
U.S.-led troops crossed the Iraq border to retaliate - oil prices nearly doubled, 
and stayed there for over a year. Last week traders on the U.S. futures market 
saw the specter of a repeat of this "war premium", and added a dollar to the price 
of each barrel. 
<p>The industrialized world has already begun feeling the war on terrorism in 
its bottom lines. Fortune magazine has estimated the price tag for businesses 
in the U.S. alone at $150 billion a year to cover the increased costs of things 
like transportation, more insurance coverage, and security technology and personnel. 
The same effects have been felt in Canada and the rest of the western world. 
<p>The point is these costs are not adding to economic productivity and future 
oil prices hikes will only make that worse. 
<p>One branch of American business isn't feeling any pain. Defense stocks have 
been soaring. President Bush has been making a lot of noise about fiscal restraint, 
but as the Vice Chair of Boeing said recently "the purse is now open" to the defense 
industry. The shock to the American psyche delivered on September 11 has eliminated 
all the pressure for "hard choices" on U.S. military spending, including for an 
Iraq invasion. 
<p>The last Gulf war cost $80 billion. Eighty percent of that was borne by America's 
allies but few countries are signing up to help this time and no one expects the 
bill to come in as low as 80 billion. 
<p>Massive military increases, combined with massive tax cuts, have already begun 
to balloon the U.S. budget deficit, just as they did during the Reagan years. 
This is hardly what a weak economy needs. The increases in the cost of borrowing 
to finance the defect will put pressure on long-term interest rates, and crowd 
out private-sector borrowing. The consumer spending that has been buoyed by extremely 
low rates for home mortgages and new cars is likely to dry up fast. It all portends 
recession. Further retreat by Americans from foreign investment will spread these 
recessionary pressures around the globe. 
<p>Most industrialized countries have supported the U.S. fight against al Qaeda 
but now they're scratching their heads over what an invasion of Iraq has to do 
with it. Testimony a couple of weeks ago before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee emphasized that this invasion wont be easy and it won't be quick. The 
world is looking at a protracted U.S. military presence in Iraq that will last 
years, not months. And if there's a war the world could be facing the collateral 
damage of a destabilized Middle East. All good reasons to worry.
