<p> I looked around Civic Center on Saturday and wondered where the years have 
gone. There were dreadlocked young people and kids with pink hair and pierced 
faces. But most in the crowd were graying antiwar veterans of the 1960s. 
<p>Thirty-five years later, they still had the old fire.</p>
<p>They danced to reggae music, wore "No war" buttons and chanted "No blood for 
oil" on cue. They carried signs saying, "No war for votes" and "Who would Jesus 
bomb?" They hugged old friends and, I may have been imagining things, but I thought 
I caught a whiff of ganja in the air.</p>
<p>It was like a flashback, a reunion.</p>
<p>Just like the last time they protested a war, these folks can expect to be 
trivialized, ridiculed, dismissed.</p>
<p>They obviously don't care.</p>
<p>They had come to rile things up and to rediscover their counterculture roots.</p>
<p>Speakers called for "regime change in the United States" and the crowd roared. 
They announced plans for another protest Monday outside of the hall where President 
Bush will be speaking in Denver, and they cheered some more. They vowed to vote, 
to protest, to take to the streets, and they clenched their fists and jabbed them 
in the air.</p>
<p>Bob Musil of Physicians for Social Responsibility called war in Iraq "immoral." 
Civil rights activist Alvertis Simmons called it the moment of "revolution we've 
been waiting for." Lucia Guzman, former director of the Colorado Council of Churches 
and a Denver school board member, said the people waited too long to stop the 
war in Vietnam and she won't let that happen again.</p>
<p>But Vietnam and Iraq are very different.</p>
<p>When I stood in a crowd of protesters in Madison, Wis., in 1969, I knew that 
every one of us could name a casualty - and, even more importantly, we could look 
around at the potential casualties among us.</p>
<p>My brother had been drafted not long after our neighbor's son had come back 
in a body bag. I knew exactly why I was there.</p>
<p>The '60s demonstrators were angry, scared and tired of being taken for granted. 
The war was real. It was personal.</p>
<p>War with Iraq is only theoretical. It's abstract and political, a faceless 
debate.</p>
<p>At least it was until now.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Minnesota Democrat who vigorously opposed the resolution to 
authorize war in Iraq became the conscience of the peace movement.</p>
<p>Sen. Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane crash, was remembered by leaders in 
both parties as a man of conviction, a characteristic that even his colleagues 
in Congress admit has become rare in American politics.</p>
<p>The former Vietnam-era antiwar activist was considered one of the few who never 
sold out for a vote or a buck.</p>
<p>The crowd at Civic Center remembered Wellstone with a moment of silence and 
then, more appropriately, with a moment of noise - a cheering, chanting call to 
action.</p>
<p>Alan Gilbert, a professor of international affairs at the University of Denver, 
reminded the protesters that they can make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>"Here is democracy," he said, spreading his arms to acknowledge the crowd spilling 
out of the amphitheater.</p>
<p>"This is what it means to live in a democracy."</p>
<p>He called upon them to find the power of conviction in a desolate landscape 
of cheap opportunism. "Make your voices heard," he said.</p>
<p>"Wellstone lives."</p>
