<p>Last week I was asked a hard question. I participated on a national panel that 
asked participants about agricultural trends 10 years and again 100 years from 
now. I found it hard and intriguing to imagine life 100 years from now. 
<P>Governments gain and lose power, change direction and lose direction in that 
time span, and social trends, both good and bad, can change dramatically more 
than once. 
<P>A century ago, who would have imagined the horrors of two world wars, a cold 
war, nuclear arms and environmental devastation, the changes from royalist to 
communist and every other kind of governments or the ability to fly around the 
globe in a day? 
<P>Still, I gave it a try. A few of my assumptions were that: 
<P>* The climatic changes currently heading toward greater and greater extremes 
will continue that course. 
<P>* The United States will no longer be the world's superpower, and power shifts 
between developed and underdeveloped nations around the globe will leave our nation 
less affluent. 
<P>* Renewable energies will predominate; water, not petroleum, will be a principal 
limiting resource and basis for political power. 
<P>* There will be growing government subsidies for resource protection. 
<P>I don't include here my assumptions about agriculture, and I made no assumptions 
about the political structure of the nation, public commitment to open markets, 
or commitment to regulations; they are simply too volatile to predict. 
<P>My first two assumptions disturbed me most. I wish I didn't believe that the 
world's climatic extremes will grow more, not less, pronounced, with the accompanying 
implications for crop failures, disease and human and ecological destruction. 
Yet it seems inevitable, given the challenges of creating international solutions 
and the time lag between their implementation and improving weather. 
<P>And I regret a conviction that no nation, dedicated to protecting its power 
and affluence at the expense of the rest of the world, can stay powerful. Throughout 
history, empires have fallen under such circumstances. I cannot believe that our 
nation can continue our path of tremendous over-consumption, in the face of worldwide 
poverty and diseases, protected only by cumbersome and expensive military might. 
<P>Nobody making 100-year predictions today will ever know if we're right or wrong. 
But lamentably, I find support for these two dismal assumptions in news from the 
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
<P>I tried to imagine a news story from this summit where the United States leads 
in supporting renewable energy, corporate accountability and environmental commitments. 
Imagine if our nation signed tough environmental treaties, and lived up to them. 
We'd have to duck the zinging buttons popping off our shirts, we'd be so proud. 
<P>Alas, the news isn't so good. Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech to the 
World Summit once again took a defensive posture about energy, world trade and 
climate change. Again our nation fought the European community's efforts to set 
targets and timetables for adopting renewable energy. And we've stonewalled against 
meaningful international measures to enforce standards of corporate responsibility. 
<P>Yes, there is a little good news from the summit but it's mostly that people 
around the globe, rather than governments or businesses, have spent this past 
decade taking matters into their own hands to protect environmental quality and 
fight world poverty. 
<P>The summit's decade-after review of U.S. policy is sad and predictable. Not 
surprisingly, international media at the gathering characterize our nation as 
irresponsible and dishonorable. Once again our leaders represented us badly internationally. 
It was one more step toward world isolation of our nation and my worst fears of 
our nation's ultimate downfall and our destruction of the global environment in 
the process.
