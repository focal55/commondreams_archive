<p> AUSTIN -- A new wrinkle in the annals of corporate scandal: Salomon Smith 
Barney, the stock brokerage/investment banking firm, allocated almost a million 
shares of hot IPO (initial public offerings) shares in 21 different companies 
to Bernard Ebbers, CEO of WorldCom, and that is just the tip of the Everest, according 
to reports in The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere. Salomon also gave IPO shares 
to about two dozen other top telecom executives. 
<P> According to The Journal, &quot;The linking of investment banking business 
to IPO allocations has been a controversial, yet pervasive, practice on Wall Street.&quot; 
<P> The New York Times, not one to leap to a conclusion, reported, &quot;At issue 
is whether Salomon handed out such allocations to ensure that companies like WorldCom 
continued to give the firm investment banking business.&quot; 
<P> Surely not! No connection whatever. Motivated only by charity, these brokers. 
<P> Come on, get real. If this were a Third World country with CEOs getting IPOs 
in exchange for investment banking business, no one would have any trouble identifying 
it as a kickback. 
<P> Meanwhile, I&#39;m still working on President Bush&#39;s challenge at the 
economic forum in Waco, Texas. 
<P> &quot;Apart from government,&quot; he inquired, his brow furrowed with earnestness, 
&quot;what can we do?&quot; 
<P> How about we get the CEOs of the Fortune 500 together for a big prayer breakfast? 
They can discuss faith-based securities regulation, faith-based toxic waste disposal 
and other innovative &quot;apart from government&quot; approaches. 
<P> Start a &quot;Pretzels for Crawford&quot; collection? Send in your suggestions 
now. 
<P> As the United States distinguishes itself by being all-but-absent from the 
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg -- we sent a &quot;low-level&quot; 
delegation -- of course we are reminded of the words of our peerless leader on 
the subject of global warming: &quot;We&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; said Mr. 
Bush. 
<P> One interesting aspect of the debate on global warming is that there is a 
&quot;debate.&quot; Earth scientists -- even those at Texas A&amp;M -- have no 
doubt that it is happening, and happening faster than their original models predicted. 
<P> But as so often happens, public debate is deformed by corporate money. In 
the current issue of Mother Jones is a report on a corporate lobby called the 
American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which specializes in ghostwriting 
&quot;model&quot; McBills for state legislatures, bills that unsurprisingly favor 
the same corporate special interests that fund the lobby. 
<P> Texas Rep. Fred Bosse went to an ALEC conference and told MJ, &quot;I saw 
that one of the talks was on the greenhouse effect, which was one of the issues 
I&#39;ve always been interested in. There was this professor from someplace, and 
the theme of his talk was that the greenhouse effect is nothing but a scam being 
advanced by environmental terrorists to destroy business in America.&quot; 
<P> As Upton Sinclair observed, &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand 
something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&quot; But the people 
we elect to represent the public interest theoretically suffer from no such conflict 
-- except for those campaign contributions. When the scientists are telling you 
one thing, and Exxon is telling you another, who you gonna believe? Who&#39;s 
got a dog in the fight? 
<P> American corporations aren&#39;t stupid: They know from public relations. 
I am indebted to Mother Jones for the following list of recent corporate name 
changes: Nuclear Engineering is now U.S. Ecology; Monsanto Specialty Chemicals 
is now Solutia; ChemLawn/ChemGreen is now Tru Green/LandCare; the Agricultural 
Insecticide and Fungicide Association is now Crop Life America; and Benton Oil 
and Gas Co. has become Harvest Natural Resources. Think they&#39;re on to something? 
<P> What concerns me about anyone pretending to expertise describing global warming 
as &quot;a scam advanced by environmental terrorists to destroy business&quot; 
is that it sends public debate into cloud cuckoo-land. 
<P> It&#39;s not as though the measurements and readings taken by several thousand 
earth scientists around the world and by the United States government are under 
question. One can certainly debate what the findings mean in terms of global warming 
-- how much, how fast -- and scientists do have differences on those points. 
<P> But I notice an increase in the tendency on the right to think one can win 
an argument by dismissing or impugning the other side.
