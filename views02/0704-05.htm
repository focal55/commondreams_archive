<p>It's the workers, stupid.
<p> Not the accountants. Not the corrupt corporate chieftains. Not even Martha 
Stewart. You can lock them all up and the bottom line - the bottom line you can 
trust, now and forever - is that the political fix will not trickle down.
<p> The workers of WorldCom, of Enron, of Xerox, of whatever company is next up 
in headline news, cannot be made whole. No paycheck will arrive for laid-off workers 
because some congressional committee tinkers with accounting regulations. Nobody's 
retirement account is replenished with tough talk about corporate crooks. You 
can't pay for gas with that.
<p> "The longer you've been here, the more you lost," said a clerk in the downtown 
Washington office of MCI, the giant long-distance company owned by the humongous 
conglomerate WorldCom, the latest icon of corporate corruption. She'd heard about 
someone at the WorldCom complex in suburban Virginia who'd lost $400,000 on the 
company's stock in his 401(k).
<p> No one in her building seems to have been hit so hard, she said. But then, 
they are too scared to talk much, even to each other. They're barred altogether 
from talking to outsiders.
<p> "They said not to talk, if you want another paycheck," said a legal secretary 
on a cigarette break.
<p> This scandal is not quite so miserable as the Enron mess. There's no evidence 
corporate masters prevented employees from selling their WorldCom stock, even 
as the top guys cashed out. WorldCom did not require employees to hold its shares, 
chief executive John Sidgmore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday. So 
some did, some didn't.
<p> But WorldCom is a New Economy company and that means it wants nothing to do 
with those quaint Old Economy customs, like guaranteed pensions for loyal long-timers. 
In 1999, the company reported $1.12 billion in assets in defined-contribution 
pension plans, according to Nelson Information, a financial reporting company.
<p> These are funded by worker contributions. Pension researchers say America 
reached a milestone about two years ago: Workers now put more of their own money 
into pension funds and retirement savings plans than their employers do.
<p> Most of the WorldCom money was in the 401(k) plan but about a third was in 
an employee stock-ownership plan, according to the 1999 report. That means WorldCom 
stock. It closed yesterday at 22 cents, down from its peak of $64 three years 
ago.
<p> Three years is an interesting time frame. It happens to be the length of time 
the Bush administration believes employers should be allowed to force workers 
to hold company stock if, for example, the stock is awarded as the company "match" 
in a 401(k) account. This was a proposal the White House made after Enron exploded.
<p> No one talks about Enron anymore. Kenny Boy has been upstaged by conniving 
acccountants everywhere. The tearful Enron workers who lost both their jobs and 
their life savings got their day before the cameras, but not their pension legislation.
<p> The House passed a toothless measure that allows workers to get investment 
advice from firms picked by none other than the sponsors of their retirement plans 
- that is, their employers. The administration opposed efforts to limit the amount 
of company stock that can be held in 401(k)s. The Senate passed nothing, because 
of Republican objections and divisions among the Democrats controlling the chamber.
<p> Next week, the Senate is to debate and probably pass a tough-on-accountants-and-corporate-crooks 
bill. Its chief sponsor, Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), delivered the Democratic 
response to President George W. Bush's radio address last Saturday.
<p> "Corporate wrongdoing is being felt not just at the boardroom table but at 
the kitchen table as well," Sarbanes said.
<p> But it hurts more in the kitchen than in the conference room. One small way 
to ease the pain is for Congress to pass, and the president to sign, the pension 
protections both promised after Enron but still haven't delivered. </p>
