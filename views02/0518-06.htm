<p> Officially in the U.S., market rules are the cure for social problems.  Take 
people living on welfare and in poverty.

<p>The way for them “to move up the economic ladder” is to work for wages, 
noted Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio.  He supports a revision of the federal 
welfare program (now Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) signed by 
Democratic President Clinton in 1996 that ends in 2002.

<p>House Republicans such as Boehner took their cue on revising TANF from 
President Bush.  With little fanfare, House Republicans passed legislation 
on May 16 that would make TANF recipients labor longer (40 versus 30 hours 
per week).

<p>As recent entrants in the job market, they would likely work for low pay.  
Market rules dictate that people with no or little history of paid work earn 
low wages.

<p>These workers then get penalized with substandard nutrition and shelter.  
They are known as the so-called “working poor.”

<p>We see here the role of the government.  It is to enforce market rules on 
the politically powerless for the benefit of their employers.

<p>The U.S. government is not shrinking in the age of “globalization.”  Rather, 
government is increasing its enforcement power against the interests of the 
poorest people being pushed to participate more in the nation’s job market.

<p>The proposed revision of welfare is a new phase in the class war waged by 
the few against the many to regulate wages downward.  Flooding the job 
market with previously inactive workers will serve to moderate or even pull 
down the wage demands of active workers.

<p>The latter know what time it is concerning the finding and keeping of a job 
that pays the bills.  And that time is not the best for them now in the 
nation’s workplaces.

<p>Officially, the U.S. job market has yet to show clear evidence of a recovery 
from last year’s no/slow growth, or recession.  April’s official 
unemployment rate was 6.0 percent versus 5.7 percent in March.

<p>Meanwhile, some employers have indicated that they will hire new workers at 
a more sluggish rate versus the previous year due to the “soft economy.”  
Consider the jobless rate, seasonally adjusted, for workers 16 through 19 
years old, up 16.8 percent this April, a five-year high, reported The Wall 
Street Journal of May 15.

<p>Moreover, a certain kind of economic prosperity creates social conditions of 
instability. In the U.S., the accumulation of capital by a tiny minority 
with the guiding hand of government has, in turn, helped make the lives of 
the nation’s poorest adults and their dependents more precarious.

<p>They can in part thank the two parties of big business for federal welfare 
reform on Clinton's watch.  This has paved the way for the current revision.

<p>By mandating longer hours of wage-labor for TANF recipients, Congress and 
the president would force families to have less time together.  This reduces 
parental oversight of children, a recipe to increase  family stress and 
turmoil.

<p>House Republican legislation that would lengthen the work week of TANF 
recipients will be subsequently considered by the Senate.  Market rules and 
welfare reform march on.
