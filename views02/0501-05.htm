<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Israel's incursion into Palestinian territory makes it more urgent 
than ever to terminate US support for Israeli domination of the West 
Bank and Gaza. Even many of Israel's long-time supporters now 
understand that, to provide justice to Palestinians -- and also to 
salvage democracy and morality within the Jewish State itself -- the 
thirty-five-year occupation must end.

<p>As we proceed, however, peace and justice activists confront three 
overlapping challenges.

<p>First, we should know what we're talking about. Interactions at 
recent rallies between demonstrators and counterdemonstrators make it 
clear that we don't always do our homework. Like those who confront 
us, too often we overgeneralize, present inadequate views of history, 
fail to acknowledge the range of perspectives and motives on both 
sides. Sometimes we pass along easily disproved or 
impossible-to-verify exaggerations. Repeatedly, we confuse slogans 
for arguments.

<p>One example is our tepid response to the Palestine Authority's 
instant assertion that Israeli forces in Jenin massacred 500 
Palestinians. The plausible evidence is horrendous enough: some 
Israeli troops beat captured Palestinians and used others as human 
shields; blocked ambulances on flimsy pretexts; vandalized homes and 
offices; shot noncombatants, or humiliated them to teach them a 
lesson; and imposed on innocent civilians massive destruction and 
collective punishment. To all this and more, we object.

<p>But disseminating dubious claims of a large-scale massacre hurts our 
credibility.

<p>Similarly harmful is comparing Israeli actions to those of Nazi 
Germany. The extermination of millions of Jews and others -- 
systematic, totalistic, bureaucratic, scientific -- may not be 
unique, but calling every atrocity Nazi-like demonstrates either a 
weak grasp of history or a calculated misuse of it.

<p>Jews opposed to Israel's war crimes -- our numbers grow, despite the 
mainstream media's determination to ignore us -- are often moved by 
the welcome we receive from appreciative Palestinians; they should 
not have had to wait so long for our presence. But many Jews won't 
march behind banners that equate the Star of David and the Nazi 
swastika. If those banners disappeared, along with the superficiality 
that inspires them, there might be more of us.

<p>A third example: We're appalled when some Israelis propose 
"transferring" all Palestinians out of Occupied Territories. We 
should be equally appalled when Hamas reiterates its intention to 
expel from Israel all who reject the Islamic rule it intends to 
impose.

<p>Our second challenge is to communicate more effectively with our 
opponents. It's easy to list facts justifying our position. It's 
harder to respond substantively to the other side's list, to struggle 
with their best arguments rather than simply shrug off their worst. 
Applying principles evenhandedly, we should be ready to respond when 
those on the other side ask, as they always do, "What's your 
solution?"

<p>Talking with those we oppose is difficult. Even when it works, it 
only takes us so far, because mutual understanding doesn't solve 
every problem.

<p>But mutual understanding can help identify differing interests and 
values. Only then can we finally grapple with how to satisfy the 
legitimate needs of ordinary people on both sides. Any solution must 
take into account historic oppression and hostility, unequal access 
to power, and factors as varied as the role of oil and corporate 
profit and the contentious distinction between legitimate resistance 
to occupation and terrorist attacks on uninvolved civilians.

<p>Under the right circumstances, communication also reveals diversity. 
When interaction humanizes both Jews and Arabs, it becomes harder to 
believe dangerous stereotypes perpetuated by those who seek supremacy 
rather than resolution.

<p>Our third challenge is to respond with more than lip service to the 
spread of anti-Semitism. We rightly expect Jews of conscience to 
oppose Israeli aggression, just as we oppose the US government's 
post-September 11th assault on Muslim civil liberties. But we should 
also expect Palestinians and their supporters to reject those who 
blame, not Israel, but "the Jews."

<p>Some Arab governments continue to use inflammatory language and 
disseminate anti-Semitic literature. Synagogue arsons, beatings, and 
other anti-Jewish incidents escalate throughout Europe. Hate groups 
in the US use the Palestinian cause to incite violence against Jews.

<p>Despite claims to the contrary by mainstream Jewish organizations, 
every criticism of Israeli policy is not generated by anti-Semitism. 
But let's not make the opposite mistake. Sometimes the perception of 
Jew-hatred is right on target.

<p>So let's drop the slogans. Let's communicate more effectively. And 
let's unite behind the understanding that justice and liberation, 
democracy and safety, can only come about if they come to all of us, 
together.
