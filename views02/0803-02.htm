<p><I>Never apologize and never explain &#151; it's a sign of weakness.</I> <BR>
&#151; Laurence Stallings, 
<P><I>"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"</I> <BR>
<I>(screenplay.)</I> 
<P>Who said: "The president views this as a heavy-handed action that is not consistent 
with dedication to peace. . . ." and what was he talking about? 
<P>Who said: "We have no regrets about going in after bad guys and there were 
some there," and what was he talking about? 
<P>The second statement was made by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz on 
July 15 while talking about the July 1, United States air raid that killed 48 
Afghan civilians and injured 117 more in several villages in Uruzgan province, 
Afghanistan. Among the dead were 25 people at a wedding celebration. The United 
States explained that the reason the wedding party had been attacked was because 
U.S. aircraft had come under sustained and hostile fire. The wedding guests, it 
was later learned, had been firing into the air, a Pashtun wedding tradition, 
when American planes struck. 
<P>A U.S. spokesman said the shooting was "not consistent" with a wedding. He 
did not say how many Afghan weddings he had attended. Donald Rumsfeld said "I 
read in the paper there was a wedding. I just don't know the facts." The Pentagon 
admitted a bomb was errant but refused to confirm that it hit the wedding party. 
The only people who seemed to be sure what happened were the wedding guests. They 
knew that 25 of their number were killed and by whom. 
<P>On July 6, Mr. Bush called President Karzai but but did not apologize for what 
happened. With his usual eloquence he said that he wanted to "express his sympathies 
to those whose loved ones lost their lives" and as a spokesman said, "he certainly 
did express the tragedy of the situation," a statement that while enormously sincere 
is somewhat vague. It was a slight improvement over what was reported to be his 
first reaction to the bombing when press secretary Ari Fleischer said the president 
expressed "deep condolences for the loss of innocent life no matter what the cause 
is determined to be" thus suggesting that in some administration minds, the cause 
was still not known, notwithstanding newspaper reports that gave some clues. 
<P>By July 16, Mr. Wolfowitz was willing to say that he deeply regretted the civilian 
deaths and promised a full investigation. As of this time not much more has been 
said nor has there been any indication that anything particularly worthwhile resulted 
from the bombing notwithstanding Mr. Wolfowitz' initial upbeat assessment that 
there were some bad guys there. If there were any bad guys there, no one has bothered 
to tell us who they were. 
<P>The first words in this column were spoken by the White House spokesman, Ari 
Fleischer. The president was not referring to the wedding party attack but to 
the Israeli bombing of Al Daraj, a densely packed neighborhood in Aza where an 
Israeli F-16 fighter jet dropped a one-ton laser-guided bomb. It killed Sheik 
Salah Shehada, the founder of the paramilitary wing of Hamas and a well-known 
terrorist. He was held in an Israeli prison for 12 years because of his Hamas 
activities and was released only a few weeks before the most recent uprising began 
in September 2000. 
<P>Shehada was not the only casualty. Among the other dead were nine children 
and five adults. A local hospital said more than 140 people had been injured, 
15 of them seriously. 
<P>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon described the air strike as "one of our major successes" 
even though "we are always sorry about civilians that are hurt." Mr. Bush called 
it "heavy-handed" and said that the government of Sharon was aware that the apartment 
building was filled with children and adults. Fleischer criticized the Israeli 
action because of the loss of "innocent life," saying that "this heavy handed 
action does not contribute to peace." 
<P>According to reports in The New York Times, Mr. Bush was described as "visibly 
angry" at reports of the damage done when the bomb was dropped. One senior administration 
official was quoted as saying: "We had to show the Sharon government there are 
some redlines" on their action. "There was a lot of anger around here." 
<P>By evening of the day of the attack Israeli military officials were saying 
that the military had badly miscalculated the scale of the collateral damage. 
<P>There was a significant difference between the attack on the wedding party 
and the bombing of the building in Gaza City. The Israelis killed a number of 
civilians but in the process killed a well known terrorist. The Americans killed 
25 wedding guests and as far as anyone knows, no terrorist. 
<P>Notwithstanding the success of the raid, the Israelis admitted they would not 
have undertaken it had they known of the unintended consequences. One senior military 
official said: "We wouldn't have done it if we knew what the consequences would 
be." There has been no such admission from the United States with respect to the 
wedding attack. Others have said it for us. 
<P>A United Nations investigation of the wedding attack found no corroboration 
that U.S. aircraft were fired upon from the ground. The Times of London reported 
that the U.N. draft report said the American military was attempting a cover-up 
by dragging its feet on its own investigation and said there were discrepancies 
in the American accounts of what happened. Colonel Roger King, spokesman for coalition 
forces at Bagram Air Base, admitted to discrepancies in the American accounts 
of what happened saying: "Early reporting is often sketchy, and sometimes it contains 
inaccuracies." He apparently got that right. 
<P>Ari Fleischer's words should have been referring to the attack on the wedding 
party. Mr. Wolfowitz' words should have been referring to the Israeli attack. 
They weren't, and that's no surprise. We don't acknowledge error. We don't have 
to because of who we are.</p>
