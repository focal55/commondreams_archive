<p>NEW DELHI -- While the rest of us are mesmerized by talk of war and terrorism 
and wars against terror, in the state of Madhya Pradesh, in central India, a little 
life raft has set sail into the wind. 
<P>On a pavement in Bhopal, in an area called Tin Shed, a small group of people 
embarked on a journey of faith and hope. There's nothing new in what they're doing. 
What's new is the climate in which they're doing it.</P>
<P>On May 20, activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), the Save the Narmada 
Movement against Big Dams, began an indefinite fast in Bhopal. They fasted longer 
than Gandhi did on any of his fasts during India's freedom struggle.</P>

</font>Their demands are more modest than his ever were. They are protesting against 
the Madhya Pradesh government's forcible eviction of more than 1,000 Adivasi (indigenous) 
families to make way for the Maan Dam on the Narmada River. All they're asking 
is that the government of Madhya Pradesh implement its own policy of providing 
land to those being displaced by the Maan Dam.</P> 
<P>There's no controversy here. The dam has been built. The displaced people must 
be resettled before the reservoir fills up in the monsoon and submerges their 
villages. Among the activists was 22-year-old Ram Kunwar. Hers is the first village 
that will be submerged when the waters rise in the Maan reservoir. Yet during 
the fast, no government official bothered even to pay the activists a visit.</P>
<P>At the end of 30 days, the activists called off the fast, having wrested a 
meager concession from the government &#150; the setting up of a committee to 
"look into" the complaints. In India they kill us with committees.</P>
<P>Unlike other large dams in India, where the resettlement of hundreds of thousands 
of displaced people is simply not possible (except on paper, in court documents), 
in the case of Maan the total number of displaced people is about 6,000. People 
have even identified land that is available and could be bought and allotted to 
them by the government. And yet the government refuses.</P>
<P>Instead it's busy distributing paltry cash compensation, which is illegal and 
violates its own policy. It says quite openly that if it were to give in to the 
demands of the Maan "oustees," it would set a precedent for the hundreds of thousands 
of people, most of them Dalits (untouchables) and Adivasis, whose villages are 
slated to be submerged by the 29 other big dams planned in the Narmada Valley. 
The state government's commitment to these projects remains absolute, regardless 
of the social and environmental costs.</P>
<P>What will happen to those displaced by the Maan Dam when their villages are 
submerged in a few weeks' time? Will they just go down in the ledgers as "the 
price of progress" along with the millions of other people displaced by big dams? 
That phrase cleverly frames the whole argument as one between those who are prodevelopment 
versus those who are antidevelopment &#150; and suggests the inevitability of 
the choice you have to make: prodevelopment, what else? It slyly suggests that 
movements like the NBA are antiquated and absurdly anti-electricity or anti-irrigation. 
This, of course, is nonsense.</P>
<P>The NBA believes that big dams are obsolete. It believes there are more democratic, 
more local, more economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways of generating 
electricity and managing water systems. It is demanding more modernity, not less. 
It is demanding more democracy, not less. And look at what's happening instead.</P>
<P>Any government's condemnation of terrorism is credible only if it shows itself 
to be responsive to persistent, reasonable, closely argued, nonviolent dissent. 
And yet, what's happening is just the opposite. If we do not respect and honor 
them, say nonviolent protesters, by default we privilege those who turn to violent 
means.</P>
<P>Across the world, when governments and the media lavish all their attention 
and seriousness on war talk and terrorism, the message that goes out is disturbing 
and dangerous: If you seek to air and redress a public grievance, violence is 
more effective than nonviolence. Unfortunately, if peaceful change is not given 
a chance, then violent change becomes inevitable. That violence will be (and already 
is) random, ugly, and unpredictable. What's happening in Kashmir and the horrible 
communalist violence we have seen in India are both part of this process.</P>
<P>Right now, the NBA is not just fighting big dams. It's fighting for the survival 
of India's greatest gift to the world: nonviolent resistance. You could call it 
the Ahimsa Bachao Andolan (Ahimsa means "nonviolent resistance"), or the Save 
Nonviolence Movement. Yet the Indian government has shown nothing but contempt 
for the people of the Narmada Valley, for their arguments against big dams, and 
for their movement.</P>
<P>In the 21st century, the connections among religious fundamentalism, nuclear 
nationalism, and the pauperization of whole populations because of corporate globalization 
are becoming impossible to ignore.</P>
<P>While the Madhya Pradesh government has categorically said it has no land for 
resettling displaced people, reports say that it is preparing the ground (pardon 
the pun) to make huge tracts of land available for corporate agriculture. This 
in turn will set off another cycle of uprootings and impoverishment.</P>
<P>If the Congress Party wishes to be taken seriously as an alternative to the 
destructive right-wing religious fundamentalists who have brought us to the threshold 
of ruin, it will have to do more than condemn communalism and participate in empty 
nationalist rhetoric. It will have to do some real work and some real listening 
to the people it claims to represent.</P>
<P>As for the rest of us &#150; concerned citizens, peace activists, and the like 
&#150; it's not enough to sing songs about giving peace a chance. Doing everything 
we can to support movements like the Narmada Bachao Andolan is how we give peace 
a chance. This is the real war against terror.</P>
