What makes a peacemaker these days?  Apparently with the nomination of 
President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair for the Nobel Peace 
Prize, being a peacemaker means that you can drop bombs on civilians, offer 
few options for reconciliation to your enemies and reduce spending on 
social services in favor of funding an already disproportionate military 
budget.

<p>I try to explain to my students who take "Solutions to Violence," a 
semester-long course on peacemaking for high schools that pacifism works 
and offer evidence to that fact.  Nominating Bush and Blair for the Nobel 
Peace Prize undermines this effort significantly.  So as their teacher, I 
have tried to note a few characteristics of peacemakers which might help to 
clarify the quandary we as a global community face when people who fit more 
in the category of war criminals are heralded as peace heroes.

<p>Someone seeking to be a peacemaker uses violence only as a last 
resort.  Violence has a very simple dynamic: might makes 
right.  Nonviolence on the other hand uses creativity with unlimited 
possibilities to resolve problems and seeks to evoke the human spirit in 
their enemies, that undeniable conscience which ought never be 
shelved.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn speaks of the futility of separating the 
evil people from the good people and destroying them - the same language 
George W. Bush is using to delineate the evildoers from the benevolent - 
only Solzhenitsyn truly knows that the line between good and evil runs 
through each human heart.  When we desire to kill evil, we commit to 
killing a piece of ourselves.

<p>I continue to remind my students of Gandhi's message that the goal is not 
to bring our enemies to their knees but to their senses.  To do this, we 
must offer ways for them to save face, rather than give them ultimatums 
which back them into a corner and force them to lash out in frustration of 
lack of options.  To grant our enemies the dignity they are due as human 
beings is to take a step toward reconciliation.  We can love the evildoer 
while hating the evil act.

<p>Many religious leaders have blessed many wars throughout the years, and 
just last week I heard a Catholic priest at an interfaith dialogue making 
excuses for the "Just War Theory."  My students sitting near me beckoned 
for my response.  On a sheet of scrap paper I asked them if Jesus embodied 
"Just War Theory" - if his actions represented justifications for hatred 
and retaliation, or if his message called us to a greater level of 
understanding.  Walking with our enemies.  Loving them because they are 
difficult to love.  Showing compassion and mercy.  Where is this dialogue 
happening nowadays in our war frenzy?  Dare we speak out for moderation - 
or are even clergy being swept away in this flood of madness and 
hatred?  Certainly the voices of peace and justice have been drowned in the 
swiftly moving tide.

<p>A peacemaker these days would not continue to bomb Iraq while calling for 
an end to terrorism and violence.  In the past two weeks, the United States 
has bombed Iraq four times, while calling on the United Nations to keep 
their negotiations with Iraq "short".  Talk is cheap, I suppose, when we 
have bombing to maintain!  A peacemaker would allocate more than enough 
resources so that housing, health care and education never went needy.  Dr. 
King said that any nation spending more on its military than on programs of 
social uplift is approaching spiritual death.  We are already there.

<p>It's quite handy for our government to do this, though.  We cut funding for 
social spending and overwhelm the Pentagon's budget.  This way, our 
students who are prone to fall through the cracks anyway will realize that 
there is no future for them in school, or in the workforce, and then 
believe that they have no other choice than to join the military.  We're 
eliminating options and free will under the guise of national security, 
underhandedly denying educations and futures to young people who deserve 
them.  We are killing the dreams of many young people who want to create 
better lives for themselves and their families.

<p>The most important quality of a peacemaker these days, I believe, can be 
summed up in a line from the Manifesto by Wendell Berry on the Mad Farmer 
Liberation Front: Be joyful even though you have considered all the 
facts.  A peacemaker knows the obstacles ahead.  A peacemaker cries with 
the families of those killed and labeled 'collateral damage'.  A peacemaker 
lives the spirit of peacemaking and is not afraid to take risks in the name 
of justice.  A peacemaker these days aligns with the unpopular causes, 
speaks up for the people we'd rather hate, and questions the authority 
which condones cultural genocide, mass murder and rampant militarism.

<p>This is what my students deserve to know about peacemaking.
