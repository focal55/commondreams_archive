<p>I wanted to begin this column by saying that people who view politics through 
a filter of conspiracy are ignorant of history and how the world works, probably 
paranoid, and certainly intellectually lazy. Alas, some conspiracies really exist. 
<p>For example, take the Kennedy assassination. Though Oliver Stone in his film 
“JFK” got the conspiracy angle wrong (he blamed it, using flimsy evidence, on 
Lyndon Johnson), there is overwhelming documentation linking Lee Harvey Oswald 
to an eccentric New Orleans-based airplane pilot named David Ferrie. Ferrie worked 
for Mafia boss Carlos Marcello and ran guns to anti-Castro Cubans. The Mafia, 
which ran the gambling, prostitution and drug concessions in Havana before Castro 
sent them packing, like the right-wing Cubans, had a motive to get rid of Kennedy. 
JFK, after the failure of the Bay of Pigs, had no taste for another Cuban invasion. 
<p>The Mafia/anti-Castro “who-shot-Kennedy” theory is backed by documented facts 
and transparent motives. Most conspiracy theories consist of isolated, and often 
unverifiable, facts, mixed indiscriminately with gossip, innuendo, half-truths, 
and found-documents that exist outside of any meaningful context. Most conspiracy 
theories are based on the hatred of one political group for another. When an atrocity 
happens, conspiracists construct a case in order to pin the blame on their rivals. 
<p>Such is the origin of the conspiracy theories, now flooding the internet, which 
attempt to link George W. Bush to the 9-11 terrorist bombings. Like the right-wing 
crazies who believe that the U.N. controls America and Bill Clinton killed Vince 
Foster, conspiracists on the fringe of the left believe that George W. Bush is 
responsible for the September 11 attacks. They believe he orchestrated the attacks 
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in order to create a climate of fear 
so he could suspend civil liberties, stifle dissent, and then go to war to make 
Afghanistan safe for U.S. energy companies to build an oil pipeline. 
<p>To give the conspiracists credit, they are demon researchers, single-minded 
in tracking down every shred of information that might bolster their theory. What 
they lack is an ability (or desire) to evaluate evidence and place it into a real-world 
context. They can’t see the forest for the trees and can’t distinguish popple 
from a sturdy oak. Conspiracists see the world through their own mind-set. To 
conspiracists, everything has meaning, everything happens according to plan. But 
the world doesn’t work that way. People screw up. Egos and rivalry cause chaos. 
Organizations have conflicting agendas. The FBI and CIA really don’t talk to each 
other and aren’t very good at evaluating raw intelligence data. That’s life! 
<p>One of the difficulties in debunking conspiracy theory is that the debunker 
has to track down and disprove every alleged piece of evidence. Since conspiracy 
facts rarely exist in a coherent context, each must be tracked down and disproven 
separately. It’s a no-win situation. To ardent conspiracists, anyone who challenges 
their theory becomes part of a cover-up. 
<p>I myself don’t have the investigative passion to get into the arcane trivia 
of conspiracy nonsense. All credit then to David Corn, an upstanding journalist 
for The Nation who took the time to track down the assertions of the conspiracy 
theorists and found their evidence lacking in veracity and the major purveyors 
of the theory lacking in credibility. (See “9-11 X-Files” at <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0531-03.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0531-03.htm</a><www.thenation.org>). 
<p>I reject the conspiracy theory on broader grounds, because of the way the conspiracists 
misinterpret even their more truthful assertions. The conspiracists make much 
of the Bush family’s connection with the father of Osama bin Laden. Pappa bin 
Laden has more than 50 children. By fact and on principle, one should not blame 
a father for the evil of a son (and visa versa), but it suits the conspiracists 
to insist on a direct correlation. 
<p>Conspiracists say the war in Afghanistan was planned before it happened. Duh! 
The Pentagon has contingency plans for wars in every country. There’s a whole 
bureaucracy drafting those plans as their daily work assignment. And oil? Most 
foreign policy is geared to oil and other natural resources. And the Central Asian 
countries that have the oil want the pipeline as much as the oil companies. Never 
before has the United States needed to kill its own citizens in order to justify 
aggression against another country. 
<p>More to the point, evidence indicates that the FBI and CIA had information 
about a plot before Bush took office and did nothing. Was the Clinton Administration 
part of the plan, along with the FBI, CIA, FAA, and the airline industry? And 
why four planes? Why not just one? And why target a building with thousands of 
people in it when any symbol of America would stir patriotism and cause outrage? 
And why, if the government knew of or plotted the attack, didn’t the authorities 
pack the planes with undercover agents and stop the attacks as they started? What 
a coup that would have been. Bush could have parleyed that bit of heroism into 
election for life. 
<p>The conspiracists claim that Bush is a dim bulb, yet they give him credit for 
pulling off a complex and unprecedented attack. They claim, correctly I think, 
that he is only interested in protecting the rich; so why would he support an 
act that hurt the airline and travel industry and took the bottom out of an already 
declining stock market? 
<p>It doesn’t make sense, to put it kindly. Nine-eleven conspiracy theories are 
an ugly, ignorant and dangerous distraction from the real political problems that 
the policies of the Bush Administration represent. The fact that Bush is exploiting 
the situation for political gain doesn’t make him responsible for the situation 
itself; any politician would do the same. The conspiracists, to the degree they 
are identified with the left, will do more damage to the credibility of progressive 
politics than they will to the reputation of the Bush Administration. If I didn’t 
know any better, I would say that the emergence of the 9-11 conspiracy theory 
is a FBI plot to discredit the left.
