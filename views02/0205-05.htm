A new media tic -- likening George W. Bush to Franklin D.
Roosevelt -- is already so widespread that it's apt to become a
conditioned reflex of American journalism.

     <p>By now, countless reporters and pundits have proclaimed GWB and FDR
to be kindred inspirational leaders -- wildly inflating the current
president's media stature in the process.

     <p>Hammering on the comparison until it seems like a truism, the
Washington press corps is providing the kind of puffery for the man in
the Oval Office that no ad budget could supply. But the oft-repeated
analogy doesn't only give a monumental boost to Bush's image. It also --
subtly but surely -- chips away at FDR's historic greatness, cutting him
down to GWB's size.

     <p>Ever since Roosevelt's death in April 1945 after more than 12 years
as president, many Republican leaders have sought to move the United
States out from under the enormous political umbrella created by the New
Deal -- bitterly opposed by most wealthy interests and the well-heeled
press.

     <p>Roosevelt's economic reforms embodied and strengthened grassroots
struggles for such basic goals as the right to form unions, collective
bargaining, regulation of business, progressive income tax, federal aid
to the needy and programs like Social Security. These are among the New
Deal legacies that have long been under attack, frontally or sneakily,
from most Republicans and quite a few Democrats in Washington.

     <p>For several decades, the arduous and multifaceted project of
dismantling the New Deal has taken aim at a broad political mindset as
well as specific government policies. Yet, in 2002, FDR's mindset --
fervently shared by many millions of Americans -- is scarcely
discernible through today's media fog.

     <p>The more that reporters, commentators and media-selected historians
join the chorus linking Bush with Roosevelt -- as if FDR's domestic
agenda and his underlying values scarcely merit a mention -- the more
that the actual FDR fades into the mist.

    <p> But -- moving beyond facile analogies between Dec. 7, 1941 and
Sept. 11, 2001 -- we should realize that the real Franklin Delano
Roosevelt spoke in ways that would horrify George W. Bush.

    <p> "No business which depends for existence by paying less than living
wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country,"
President Roosevelt declared in June 1933, a few months after taking
office.

     <p>Campaigning for re-election in 1936, he did not search for common
ground with the corporate giants of the day. One of his speeches noted
that big business and finance were "unanimous in their hate for me --
and I welcome their hatred."

    <p> FDR did not stop there. He added: "I should like to have it said of
my first administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust
for power met their match; I would like to have it said of my second
administration that in it these forces met their master."

    <p> After five years of his presidency, in a formal message proposing
an investigation of monopoly in the nation, Roosevelt said: "The liberty
of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private
power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State
itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism -- ownership of government by
an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power."

     <p>Across America today, there are seniors who watch George W. Bush on
television, hear the media prattle of ludicrous comparisons with
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and think: "I remember FDR. And this guy's no
FDR. No way."

     <p>We wouldn't know it from the array of major news outlets mired in
subservience to the White House spin machine and overall big-money
perspectives, but President Franklin Roosevelt was resolute about
directly confronting rich elites and corporate titans. He lambasted them
as "economic royalists."

     <p>Roosevelt matched his rhetoric with action. When he said that "the
citizens of the United States must effectively control the mighty
commercial forces which they have themselves called into being," FDR
meant it.

     <p>Perhaps it would be gratuitously unkind to compare the intellects
and depth of the two presidents. Bush has proved smart enough to fulfill
his ambition of living in the White House while serving this era's
economic royalists. That GWB has just about zilch in common with FDR
should be self-evident.

     <p>Whatever parallels may exist between Pearl Harbor and the World
Trade Center, for the two presidents they signify little more than
circumstantial similarities. Journalists might provide more illumination
by exploring similarities between Bush and Rutherford B. Hayes -- who
also managed to become president after winning fewer popular votes than
his rival but gaining enough disputed electoral votes to prevail.

<p>Political reporters and commentators are proud of being "serious"
journalists, in contrast to entertainment-driven and celebrity-fixated
media professionals. But the current craze of touting George W. Bush as
comparable to FDR is grimly laughable.
