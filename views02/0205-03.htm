WASHINGTON &#151; It says something quite revealing about the Bush administration 
that it rushes with greater urgency to win health insurance for the unborn than 
it does for the born. 
<P> Administration officials declared last week that a developing fetus should 
be eligible for government-funded health insurance for low-income children. 
<P> Ordinarily, the $40 billion, 10-year State Children's Health Insurance Program 
(S-CHIP) program, which began in 1997, covers children from birth to age 19. 
<P> Although Medicaid covered developing fetuses of welfare mothers before 1981, 
the proposed rule change will mark the first time a federal program has tried 
to define childhood as beginning before birth. In fact, this change will cover 
them to the point of conception. 
<P> The move appears to have more political than legal significance. No matter 
what the federal rule says, the Supreme Court is the arbiter of fundamental rights 
like the determination of when childhood legally begins. So far, it has not seen 
fit to offer the unborn quite as many rights as it does to the born, especially 
in the early trimesters of development. 
<P> So, why, one wonders, has the administration chosen this politically charged 
way to expand health care to improve healthy childbearing among pregnant mothers? 
<P> Administration officials assure us with a straight face that this is not a 
ploy to create new grounds for outlawing abortion. 
<P> Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said the plan "is going 
to help poor mothers be able to take care of their unborn children and get the 
medical care they absolutely vitally need." Any other interpretation of its goal 
"is just stretching," he said. 
<P> Right. And, if you believe that, they probably have a few shares of Enron 
stock to sell you, too. 
<P> Congress can expand S-CHIP to include more pregnant women without changing 
the legal definition of a child. Several members say they will do so soon in order 
to render the Bush move moot. 
<P> Also, states already can extend coverage to pregnant women by obtaining a 
federal waiver, as New Jersey and Rhode Island did last year. 
<P> No, it is not a "stretch" to believe the Bush White House is trying to score 
some points with social conservatives. It's traditional politics. No smart politician 
forgets his or her base. 
<P> But, to the rest of us, this sly move sends a message that the anti-abortion 
movement usually tries to dodge &#151; that it cares more about the unborn than 
it does about the born. 
<P> Since some of my best friends oppose a woman's right to choose abortion for 
a variety of reasons, I know that abortion foes don't always care more about the 
pre-born than they do about the born. 
<P> But what do you say about a government policy worded in a way that all but 
ignores the woman carrying the newly eligible fetus, as if she's just a biological 
chauffeur? 
<P> To women who want to believe their bodies belong to them, this policy says, 
"Think again, sister!" 
<P> But, I will take the Bush administration at its word. If the President truly 
is interested in expanding health care, I eagerly wait to see what he plans to 
do for the estimated 40 million Americans, including 10 million children, who 
lack health insurance, according to the American Medical Association. 
<P> In his State of the Union address, Bush called for passage this year of a 
Patients Bill of Rights, credits to help uninsured workers buy health care, a 
boost in health care spending for veterans and expansion of Medicare to pay for 
prescription drugs. 
<P> Those are good, much-needed proposals in a country that already has the best 
health care, but the most cobbled-together health care coverage in the industrialized 
world. 
<P> But the president did not make clear how he plans to pay for all of this plus 
his proposed boost in defense spending and still keep his cherished 10-year tax 
cut plan on schedule. 
<P> However he plans to fund his wish list, I hope he doesn't forget uninsured 
workers. Post-born people have health needs, too.</p>
