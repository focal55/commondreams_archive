In late November the central message of our mass media news journalists, and the intelligence and military experts and politicians chosen to join their public discussions, was the tremendous success of our military defeat of the Taliban. Although there was apparently little infrastructure to destroy in Afghanistan, certainly in terms of human devastation - bombing victims and creation of starving refugees - it far surpasses our other recent attacks on Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Kosovo. The key was said to be our new intelligence gathering and weaponry, technological innovations such as satellite photography, communication interception, airplanes without pilots, precision targeting, laser directed bombs and "daisy cutters." 

<p>But after the early December onslaught of the mountain Tora Bora, our airwaves have increasingly been dominated by anxious speculation about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. The likelihood of his death was often mentioned but the videos he keeps sending us seem to cast doubt on this thesis. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange there's recently been much discussion about locating him, and CNBC viewers are aware that his capture or escape will have a significant effect on the fortunes of the market. Many of our media opinion merchants - from their perspective that money is all-important to everyone - are sure that he'll be brought in by the 25 million dollar bounty on his head, which they say even his close associates will find irresistible. 

<p>It seems our technology has lost Osama temporarily, however our president continually assures us that he will be found. He also assures us that our war on terrorism will eventually stamp it out rather than breed more. This would indeed be an achievement - one need only glance through the Old Testament to realize that this scourge has been with us from the beginning. 

<p>Where does his confidence come from?  I was frightened by his military speech at the Citadel several weeks ago. He discussed the recent scientific advances in the areas of keeping tabs on people and apprehending or eliminating the dangerous ones, concluding that the struggle between good and evil (the coming apocalypse?) will be resolved by our innovation and superiority in intelligence and military technology. 

<p>To me it seemed like a fantasy - like watching Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader fighting with electronic laser swords. My immediate reaction was that he's been seeing too many movies. He did not mention or seem concerned about the problem of which of us will be considered the evil ones or by whom and how such determinations will be made. What was clear from his speech was that our world-wide economic system is going to be maintained by a national or international police force which will be effective precisely to the extent that it limits the freedom and privacy of all of us. 

<p>Economic decentralist and community-of-place advocate Wendell Berry has warned that the worst outcome of September 11 will be if we continue our misplaced confidence that our technologically complex, centralized global economy is protectable by "national defense," and if we fail to address the possibility that we are trapped in the network of transportation and communication that was supposed to make us free. 

<p>On September 11 we got a message, whether knowingly sent or not. Unjustifiably killing innocents, nineteen terrorists were able as tricksters to use our technology to destroy the huge buildings symbolizing our global financial and military power. The message is that neither our wealth, power nor technology makes us superior or even less vulnerable. Perhaps Osama's continued absence from our radar screens will help us listen. </p>
