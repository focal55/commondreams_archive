<p>Realistic solutions to increasing our security involve radical ideas. 
These ideas will be denounced as impossible, utopian, or unnecessary. 
But such proposals, which all have positive value apart from their 
importance to security, would actually work.

<p>We are either in dire danger, or we are not.  If the threat is as 
serious as the administration would like us to believe, than the 
response must be equally serious.  Opposition to the following 
proposals can therefore be taken as either a lack of seriousness or 
as evidence of conflicts of interest between personal profit and real 
national security.

<p>A preamble to a radical security program should eliminate the 
fascistic term "Homeland Security", to be replaced, perhaps, with 
"Domestic Security".  The following proposals could be realistically 
implemented over the next few years.  Most of them are already in 
place in some form, either at the local level in the United States or 
elsewhere.

<p>1. Eliminate nuclear power, the single most scary terrorist target.

<p>2. Build a world-class passenger rail system to provide redundency in 
our transportation networks.  An attack on our aviation system would 
never again shut the country down.

<p>3. Increase fuel economy standards for all vehicles, especially 
S.U.V.'s and passenger vans.  Let's stop sending our money to the 
terrorists via our gasoline purchases.  In addition, we should fund 
non-profit car-sharing schemes like City Car Share in San Francisco, 
which allows members to drastically reduce car usage, at least in 
urban areas.

<p>4. Adopt a national energy policy that provides for alternatives to 
nuclear power and fossil fuel production, both domestic and foreign. 
We should increase funding for clean, renewable sources of energy, 
including solar and wind power.  This can be done by subsidizing 
local efforts to provide alternative power such as the $100 million 
solar bond measure recently passed in San Francisco.  We should also 
fund programs to increase energy efficiency in all aspects of the 
economy, and to improve energy conservation efforts.  Finally, we 
should move away from private energy companies and towards the sort 
of democratic, local public power generation represented by the 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD).

<p>5. Enact universal, single-payer health insurance.  This would 
improve public health and our ability to respond to an attack with 
biological weapons.  The significant number of Americans who are 
uninsured or under-insured are particularly vulnerable, but a large 
outbreak would threaten even those suburbanites who vote Republican 
and think that they are safe in their gated enclaves.

<p>6. Encourage Israel to withdraw immediately from the territories 
occupied in 1967, and support the establishment of a Palestinian 
state within these borders.  We should work with both sides to assure 
the security of each state and validity of the borders.

<p>7. End the client-state system of American empire.  We must cease all 
funding and arming of non-democratic governments, with Saudi Arabia, 
Pakistan, and Egypt at the top of the list.  After all, it should be 
assumed that whoever funds and arms dictatorships will be the object 
of resentment and reprisal from those who suffer under such regimes. 
We should then immediately announce a plan to provide economic 
development aid (not loans) for those nations and political 
organizations willing to democratize and observe international human 
rights standards.

<p>8. Start to observe democracy and human rights standards in our own 
domestic and foreign policy (see the Amnesty International report on 
human rights in the United States).  This will improve the sort of 
good will necessary for international cooperation in police work. 
International good will toward the U.S. was prominent in the 
immediate aftermath of September 11th.  It has been completely 
squandered by the Bush administration, who have succeeded in the 
dubious achievement of uniting most of the world against us.

<p>You won't hear the Bush administration or the Democrats talk about 
these types of solutions, because they are not serious about reducing 
terrorism.  Their primary goals are political and economic power for 
themselves and their clients in corporate America, who fund their 
campaigns.  First in importance among these corporate donors are the 
energy companies, who help so much to put the "conflict" in "conflic 
of interest."  Terrorism is the natural outcome of such arrangements, 
and is seen as worth the price.

<p>These proposals would cost money, but probably not as much money as 
will be spent on useless weapons systems like "Star Wars" (not very 
helpful in fighting fanatics armed with box cutters) and perpetual 
wars involving the bombing of brown-skinned people.  Needless to say, 
in addition to increasing our security dramatically, radical policies 
would have tremendous environmental and economic benefits.  In the 
end, they would likely generate revenue and help to democratize our 
economy.

<p>We know that anyone driving an S.U.V. while waving a flag is either 
ignorant or in serious denial concerning world politics.  But how 
many Americans would consider the above solutions?  How scared are 
we?  How serious are we?  What are we willing to give up?

<p>When we see the opposition to the above proposals in congress, we can 
conclude at the very least that our problems are not technical, but 
political.  A necessary first step to the realization of the above 
program would therefore be to implement real democracy in America. 
This would involve, among other reforms, public financing of 
political campaigns, as the citizens of Maine have done, and Instant 
Runoff Voting (IRV), which recently passed in San Francisco.

<p>If terrorism is a long-term threat to the innocent citizens of the 
United States, and it will be as long as we continue with our 
imperial policies, than we should be looking at long-term solutions, 
not short-term bombing campaigns.  Let's demonstrate a seriousness 
about a subject that the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld cabal refuse to take 
seriously.  Let's admit that the only serious solutions are utopian.
