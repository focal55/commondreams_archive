The Office of Strategic Influence went from obscurity to infamy to 
oblivion during a spin cycle that lasted just seven days in late February. 
Coming to terms with a week of negative coverage after news broke that the 
Pentagon office might purposely deceive foreign media, a somber defense 
secretary announced: "It is being closed down." But for Donald Rumsfeld and 
his colleagues along the Potomac, the inky cloud of bad publicity has a big 
silver lining.

      <p>Orders to shut the controversial office came a day after President 
Bush proclaimed zero tolerance for lies from U.S. officials. "We'll tell 
the American people the truth," he vowed.

      <p>Would the Defense Department try to deceive journalists? The question 
in the air was distasteful, and the answer from Rumsfeld could only offer 
comfort: "This is something the Pentagon has not done, is not doing and 
would not condone."

      <p>A retired Air Force general was likewise reassuring when the Office 
of Strategic Influence crashed and burned. "I'm absolutely convinced that 
in no way would top officials of the administration ever have approved 
lying to the media," said Donald Shepperd, who now works as a CNN military 
analyst.

      <p>After Rumsfeld ceremoniously disbanded the office, amid profuse 
pledges of veracity, Newsday columnist Ellis Henican astutely observed: 
"But don't worry, Rumsfeld's people were whispering yesterday around the 
Pentagon. They'll keep on spreading whatever stories they think they have 
to -- to foreigners especially. Call it the free flow of misinformation. 
Who needs a formal office for that?"

      <p>The whole brouhaha must have caused quite a few laughs in high places 
behind the Pentagon's thick walls.

      <p>In American news outlets, some of the attacks on the Office of 
Strategic Influence actually reinforced the notion that the U.S. government 
has no rational motive for hiding truth, since its real endeavors can 
proudly stand the light of day. It's an easy misconception that would 
hardly displease the propagandists who concocted the Office of Strategic 
Influence in the first place.

      <p>At the end of a tough New York Times piece, titled "Office of 
Strategic Mendacity," columnist Maureen Dowd applied an oily salve to the 
PR wounds she'd just inflicted. "Our cause is just," she concluded. "So why 
not just tell the truth?"

      <p>Why not just tell the truth? Because -- whether the issue is support 
for human-rights abusers or civilian deaths courtesy of U.S. taxpayers -- 
"the truth" would often indicate that the Pentagon's cause is not just. 
That's why not.

      <p>As soon as Rumsfeld declared the Office of Strategic Influence to be 
null and void, some public-relations dividends began to flow. The Chicago 
Tribune quoted Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee 
for Freedom of the Press, generously praising officials at the Pentagon: 
"This is good news for the public. Now we can have more confidence that 
what they're telling us is true."

      <p>But anyone would be ill-advised to have "confidence" in the 
truthfulness of Pentagon pronouncements -- or to trust that officials 
aren't hiding key facts with the simple strategy of withholding 
information. As a practical matter, the most effective whoppers -- "the 
greatest triumphs of propaganda," in the words of Aldous Huxley -- are told 
by maintaining "silence about truth."

      <p>Four centuries ago, the French cardinal and statesman Richelieu wrote 
that concealing true intentions "is the art of kings." ("Savoir dissimuler 
est le savoir des rois.") For kings and presidents, the illusion of 
credibility is crucial. Manipulative successes hinge on deference from 
courtiers and scribes; reporters and pundits.

      <p>To a significant extent, the uproar over the Office of Strategic 
Influence could end up leaving the impression that the Pentagon has a 
policy of being truthful with journalists. If so, other institutions eager 
to repair their images might consider setting the stage for similar 
damage-control moves.

      <p>For instance, if a staffer at Philip Morris leaked a memo proposing 
to deliberately target teenagers with cigarette advertisements, the 
president of the firm could then call a news conference to explain that 
he's shocked -- shocked! -- that anyone would suggest such a thing. With 
luck, some news accounts would portray nipping the formal proposal in the 
bud as an indication of resolute integrity. Meanwhile, young people would 
remain in the cross hairs of countless cigarette ads.

      <p>Such tactics can only succeed, of course, to the extent that 
journalists are gullible -- or believe that they must pretend to be -- 
while encouraging the public to go along with the charade.

      <p>Hey, whatever works.
