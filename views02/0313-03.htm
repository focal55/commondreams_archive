I'M NOT A particularly fearful fellow. But I haven't been this frightened since, say, October 1962.
      <P>And I have two opposite but reinforcing fears. One is fear of Them. The other is fear of Us.</P>



<P>It's clear that we now live in a world in which Americans are no longer safe from other people's rage, justified or not. And, very likely, it is only going to get worse.</P>



<P>Since Sept. 11, we've gone through three stages. The first stage was: The world will never be the same; we are all vulnerable. This was only reinforced by the anthrax scare.</P>



<P>But the experts reassured us that Sept. 11 was a ''one-off'' - a fluke. It had been years in the planning. They had thrown at us everything they had. Our security was asleep at the switch. But now we were wide awake. Nobody would ever successfully turn an jetliner into a human bomb again.</P>



<P>In Afghanistan, we routed Al Qaeda and the Taliban. We dedicated tens of billions to upgrade everything from airport screenings to electronic surveillance. The anthrax turned out to be home-grown.</P>



<P>And life went on. No second incident materialized. Consumers relaxed; the economy recovered.</P>



<P>Now, however, dread has returned. Now the experts are telling us that a suitcase bomb, smuggled into America in a container ship, using easily available radiological materials, could render Manhattan uninhabitable.</P>



<P>And time is on Their side. The technology of destruction will only get smaller, cheaper, more easily concealed. With the entire world moving toward more open commerce, we will never have perfect security as a country.</P>



<P>Even at the height of the Cold War, the fear was of a different sort. There was simply a slight chance that we would all be blown to bits. So we went into a mass denial and resumed normal life.</P>



<P>This war is different. The entirely reasonable fear is of more incidents, sooner or later, of large-scale random terror. Denial is harder, and less justified.</P>



<P>We watch the nightly reports from Israel and fear what our own society could become - more besieged, more at risk of wanton violence, less democratic, more prone to disastrous misjudgment.</P>



<P>The other day, one of the most sensible people I know said she was scrapping plans to move to New York. Too risky. So stage one was right after all. The world will never be the same.</P>



<P>But the other entirely rational fear is fear of Us, in this case played by George W. Bush. After Sept. 11, the administration dispatched the Taliban in a brief war with few US casualties. Americans united in outrage. We concluded, because we needed to, that this dubious and callow president had become a true wartime leader and gave him unprecedented support.</P>



<P>Now, however, nearly everything the administration does only intensifies one's fears. There is no coherent plan for the next phase of the ubiquitous war on terrorism, only scattershot policies that will make the world an even more dangerous place.</P>



<P>Whether it is an ill-specified axis of evil, or a decision to make tactical nuclear war thinkable, or a domestic ''shadow government,'' or deliberately leaked plans to attack Iraq, George W. Bush in his own way is as frightening as Al Qaeda.</P>



<P>And we are not supposed to say so. It took Senator Robert Byrd, an 84-year-old throwback, not a lefty but an old-fashioned constitutionalist, to declare that while the president was commander-in-chief, this was still a democracy.</P>



<P>Most Democrats are still traumatized by the country's fearful jingoism and the president's ratings. Unlike the divisive Vietnam War, antiterror remains a popular crusade, which means scant restraint on lunatic schemes that increase the risk of wider war.</P>



<P>And this could be a semipermanent condition. All it will take is one more major incident on American soil to push the president's ratings back over 90 percent and the Democrats back into their bunkers. Such incidents will surely occur.</P>



<P>There is only so much we can do about the risk of random assault, but we can at least reclaim our own democracy. Terrorism, unfortunately, is all too real. But so is one's terror of the Bush presidency.</P>



<P>Every reckless scheme will have to be challenged with the only means we have: democratic opposition. Right after Sept. 11, there was no place for a popular movement against the Afghan War. But there must now be one against the administration's ill-considered sequels.</P>



<P>Otherwise, the daily risk will only increase, not just because of Them but because of Us. </P>
