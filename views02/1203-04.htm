<p>I have got to swear off CNN.
<P></P>
Wolf Blitzer is not good for my health. Paula Zahn makes my blood boil. Howard 
Kurtz makes me ashamed to call myself a media critic.
<P></P>
I should spend more time watching CBC Newsworld. Or maybe CTV Newsnet. (I'd watch 
CP24 but there's only so much Mel Lastman a girl can stand.)
<P></P>
The trouble with Canadian news, with all its earnestness and <i>gravitas</i>, 
is that it's kind of boring. It's filled with fish and wheat fields and wood and 
water and policy wonks.
<P></P>
It's not the presentation on the CanNets that bugs me. Canadian anchors and reporters 
tend to be hairdos and shoulders above their more highly-paid U.S. counterparts. 
I'll take a puffy Mike Duffy over a chiselled John King anytime. It's just our 
news is so full of, you know, issues that affect our daily lives and stuff: the 
environment, the economy, the government, and other deadly dull topics. 
<P></P>
I mean, why can't we have plagues on <i>our </i>cruise ships? Why don't <i>our</i> 
politicians dick around with interns? Why don't <i>our</i> weapons inspectors 
dress up in leather boxers, studded collars and rubber hoods? Do you realize that, 
unlike the U.S. where they can pick and choose their shooting stories, just about 
every single murder in Canada is reported? And how come <i>we're</i> never having 
a "showdown" with a brutal dictator?
<P></P>
And don't get me started on foreign news, eh? Canadian news networks are all over 
international stories the way Larry King is all over his female guests. We Canadians 
are subjected to elections in Argentina, oil slicks in Spain, elections in Israel, 
all kinds of things happening over somewhere. And thank God too because otherwise 
we'd be stuck with the ho-hum headlines from home. 
<P></P>
Sure, sure. CNN has Christiane Amanpour, Nic Robertson and others but they don't 
seem to get on screen very often, and when they do, it's always a "crisis" and 
they're talking in herky-jerky ways, with long pauses between the anchors' questions 
and their answers. 
<P></P>
Then there are the ads.
<P></P>
Newsworld is always appealing to the one-foot-in-the-grave crowd, what with all 
those pitches for adjustable beds, life insurance, funeral coverage and reverse 
mortgages. On CNN you can see really cool commercials for major weapons manufacturers, 
like we did last month when the network was reporting the mid-term elections results.
<P></P>
But I gotta stop watching CNN because, when my dog looks guilty because I am screaming 
at the TV, something is rotten in state of media columnizing.
<P></P>
Let us consider this past weekend.
<P></P>
Saturday morning, as usual, there was that hour <i>Saturday Edition </i>that I 
fondly think of as T'n'A, Tits and Analysis. That's because it's a round table 
discussion show filled with CNN's women correspondents.
<P></P>
They were nattering on about, what else, Iraq and I'm thinking, c'mon girls, don't 
let me down, what about the appointment of Dr. Death, Henry Kissinger, as head 
of the so-called "independent" inquiry into the Sept. 11 intelligence failures?
<P></P>
Yak, yak, yak. Chat, chat, chat. Natter, natter, natter. Then, just before they 
signed off, and right after waxing enthusiastically about last Thursday's Santa 
Claus parade, Kissinger was raised by one woman who was about to launch into his 
history with Chile, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Angola ...
<P></P>
Just as she got going, another woman shut her down, dismissing questions about 
Kissinger's past as just so much "cynicism." And then, guess what? We're out of 
time and let's move onto President George W. Bush's weekly radio address.
<P></P>
To add insult to injury, Blitzer had Kissinger on his <i>CNN Late Edition </i>&#8212; 
sub-titled, wait for it, "Showdown: Iraq" &#8212; where he demonstrated, once 
again, his ability to interview while on his knees. 
<P></P>
While he briefly touched on allegations of Kissinger's conflicts of interests, 
he never once mentioned how the great statesman can hardly travel outside the 
U.S. nowadays for fear of being hauled off to war crimes court in The Hague.
<P></P>
But to me the last straw was Kurtz's <i>Reliable Sources</i>, the show that purports 
to "turn a critical lens on the media." Do you suppose Kurtz looked at the Kissinger 
coverage? Nah. Do you think he examined how the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq 
are playing games with the media, raising suspicions that they're setting up their 
mission to fail so Bush can charge in with his "regime change?" Pfffft. Do you 
think he invited the real president-elect Al Gore on to talk about his controversial 
criticisms of the U.S. media last week? 
<P></P>
Are? You? Kidding? 
<P></P>
Instead, Kurtz had a warm and fuzzy chat with right-wing radio talk show host 
Rush Limbaugh who reiterated his tiresome <i>spiel </i>about left-wing bias in 
the media.
<P></P>
Right. Of course. Left-wing bias in the media. How did I manage to miss that?
