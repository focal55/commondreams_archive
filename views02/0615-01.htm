<p> In the U.S., the attack on nonwhite people generally has foreshadowed the 
current assault on the general public’s civil rights.  The concealment of 
this connection reveals its importance.

<p>That is, skin-color has been a fault line in the class war waged by the few 
against the many in the U.S.  This aggression has taken different forms in 
different places.

<p>One recent form is the fraudulent Drug War.  In brief, this war has been an 
exercise in state power (executive, legislative and judicial branches of 
government) against the nonwhite population in the U.S.

<p>The Drug War has partly resulted in the incarceration of low-level illegal 
drug sellers and users, mainly people of color, with longer and longer 
prison sentences.  Locking them up has dovetailed with the attack on living 
and working standards by the owners of the country during the past 25 years 
of slow/no economic growth.

<p>Racial profiling was also a weapon of state power against people of color 
during the voting rights purge in the Florida 2000 elections.  What goes 
around comes around.

<p>Now, under the War on Terror, the white population in the U.S. is also the 
target of state power.  In the name of security, their civil rights are 
at-risk.

<p>Perhaps some with white skin believed, or never perhaps thought they could 
be profiled by the state.  That was for the other woman or man.

<p>Well, that’s not how the system works during crises.  We live in such a time 
now.

<p>During a crisis, the nation’s rulers swing state power with full force 
against those who dare to dissent.  The FBI’s COINTELPRO campaigns to ruin 
and wreck the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War movements of the 1960s are 
cases in point.

<p>Richard Cohen, whose work is distributed by the Washington Post Writers 
Group, recently criticized Attorney General John Ashcroft.  Cohen continued: 
“Not since J. Edgar (Hoover, former FBI director) has Washington seen such a 
publicity hound.”

<p>But using the cloud cover of national security to roll back the civil rights 
of U.S. citizens is hardly a matter of Ashcroft seeking the political 
spotlight.  State power has been used against organized labor and the 
freedom movements of nonwhite people for decades.

<p>For reasons of keeping the nation and the world safe for the market economy, 
the owners of the country have relied on the state to keep the U.S. working 
population under control.  Too much freedom threatens the power, privilege 
and wealth of these rulers.

<p>Accordingly, those who run the system have billions of reasons to maintain 
divisions within the diverse working-class.  Some workers perpetuate these 
skin-color divisions, to their great disadvantage.

<p>In fact, the blind spot of white workers in their relations with nonwhite 
workers in the U.S. is perhaps the major point of disunity.  Throughout the 
nation's history, this division has served to weaken workers as a class.

<p>But that weakness has changed and can change again.  Two examples are 
agitation against slavery and for the eight-hour day after the Civil War, 
and mobilization against racism and for increased labor union strength 
during the 1930s.

<p>Weakening the color line in U.S. society benefits the majority, a point 
obscured by the priesthood of politicians and pundits.  The wielding of 
state power against those whose white-privilege previously shielded them 
follows from the state’s treatment of its nonwhite population.

<p>Hush now?  I think not.
