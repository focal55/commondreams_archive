<p>A few years ago, the government of Colombia asked the United States to trace 
nearly fifty MAK-90 rifles it had seized from the National Liberation Army, or 
ELN. It turned out these rifles had been obtained by Colombian gun traffickers 
after being purchased at retail stores in the Miami area. The ELN is on the State 
Department's foreign terror watch list. Yet, like many other underground armies 
around the world, it buys its weapons in one of the world's freest arms markets. 
"The United States has for many years been a warehouse, a shopping center, if 
you will, for firearms," says retired Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
(AFT) resident agent in charge Daniel McBride, "because of the ease of acquisition, 
not just in the state of Florida but typically throughout the United States. We 
are a very easy place from which to obtain firearms for transshipment back home." 
</p>
<p> Law enforcement officials describe the United States as a one-stop shop for 
the guns sought by terrorists, mercenaries and international criminals of all 
stripes. And September 11 has not changed that in any significant way. In fact, 
Attorney General John Ashcroft has refused to permit the use of gun purchase records 
to track crimes, a practice that the FBI had previously used and that conceivably 
could help to identify terrorists. Nor did Ashcroft propose closing gun loopholes 
as part of the USA Patriot Act. The result of the lax US system, says McBride, 
is "an ongoing cycle" in which weapons bought here end up fueling violence abroad, 
and in which America is regarded as the firearms "shopping center for the world." 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 18px" class="tn5"> <b>Lobster Air and Gun Land</b> </p>
<p icap="on"> The story of a ragtag South Florida outfit called Lobster Air International 
illustrates just how easy US gun purchases can be. In the summer of 1998 Stephen 
Jorgensen began buying the first of what were eventually more than 800 MAK-90 
semiautomatic rifles at a store called Gun Land in Kissimmee, Florida. He did 
not have a resale permit--known as a Federal Firearms License, or FFL--and he 
was not required to present one. But Jorgensen wasn't stockpiling the guns for 
his personal use; he was taking them to Opa-Locka airport near Miami and loading 
them aboard a light airplane headed for airstrips in Venezuela and Colombia, via 
Haiti. </p>
<p> Jorgensen's South American clients originally wanted AK-47s, but in the United 
States, the fully automatic AK-47 can be purchased from a dealer only with a Class 
3 permit, which is difficult to obtain. The AK was modified in 1990 to get around 
the California Assault Weapons Ban--hence MAK-90, or "Modified AK 1990." It is 
virtually identical to the AK-47 but costs only $200 to $300, compared with $1,000 
to $3,000 for a Russian-made AK-47. It is exempt from the national Assault Weapons 
Ban, enacted after the California ban, because it has slight alterations that 
give it a hunting-rifle appearance. Jorgensen, a hefty man with an easygoing manner, 
says the distinction is absurd. "These weapons happened to be a loophole because 
they didn't have a pistol grip on the stock. They had a thumbhole. How ridiculous!" 
The MAK-90 can use the same caliber bullet as the AK-47, and it can be converted 
to fully automatic with rudimentary mechanical skills; a number of websites offer 
kits and instructions. </p>
<p> The smuggling operation began when a lieutenant colonel of the Venezuelan 
Air Force asked Rafael Ceruelos if he knew anyone who could buy guns. Ceruelos, 
of Cuban origin, is a self-described import-export businessman who had already 
been doing business with the colonel, selling him aircraft parts through connections 
he had with an aircraft broker from Texas. Ceruelos speaks in a raspy voice, a 
more sophisticated version of Al Pacino's gruff Tony Montana character from <i>Scarface</i>. 
He likes to use words like "friggin'" a lot. He says that he just wanted to keep 
his clients happy. </p>
<p> Ceruelos says the Texan hooked him up with Jorgensen, an old Vietnam War buddy 
in Tampa who could get weapons at a discount. In 1998 several meetings took place 
in Dallas, Miami and Caracas to orchestrate a deal, which included setting up 
Lobster Air to import lobsters to the United States from Haiti. According to Jorgensen, 
the Venezuelan colonel and the interests he represented put up the money to buy 
an Aero Commander aircraft. Jorgensen contracted boat operators to circle Haiti 
and collect lobsters from remote villages, but that part of the plan never went 
forward. Lobster Air was apparently not in the business of selling lobsters. </p>
<p> On January 3, 1999, US Customs agents, acting on what they thought was a drug 
tip, stopped the Aero Commander, bound for South America, on a runway at Opa-Locka. 
But there were no drugs; instead, the plane was loaded with seventy-eight disassembled 
MAK-90s inside blue gym bags, along with 9,000 rounds of ammunition. Customs and 
ATF sources now say that Lobster Air's weapons were headed to Colombia's FARC 
rebels, another group on the State Department's terror list. But McBride, the 
retired ATF agent, says that "when guns are going into Colombia, there are a number 
of potential sources they could be going to, including the drug cartels, the various 
insurgency groups, paramilitary forces over there.... [It's] very difficult to 
tell exactly where those guns were going to go, unless you were fortunate enough 
to get some confiscated and then have the traces run back." </p>
<p> Jorgensen was detained and interrogated. Facing indictment on weapons and 
conspiracy charges, he quickly agreed to cooperate with what was now a US Customs-ATF 
investigation. Meanwhile, Ceruelos proceeded to concoct more business. Jorgensen, 
however, was recording their conversations for federal prosecutors. The Venezuelan 
customers needed 200,000 rounds of ammunition, so Ceruelos agreed that Jorgensen 
would buy the ammo at a local gun shop in 10,000-round increments, so as not to 
arouse suspicion. Jorgensen assured Ceruelos, "They don't monitor buying the ammunition; 
you don't sign, nobody knows you bought it. So that's a fairly low risk." </p>
<p> With the secret recordings in prosecutors' hands, Jorgensen and Ceruelos were 
soon indicted--not for buying the guns, but for violating the Arms Export Control 
Act. Ceruelos served fifteen months and Jorgensen received only probation, thanks 
to his cooperation and what he describes as a "sterling military record." It may 
be surprising to learn that buying hundreds of MAK-90s and thousands of rounds 
of ammunition that could supply US-designated terrorist organizations doesn't 
raise any eyebrows. But there is simply no requirement for gun stores to report 
suspicious activity. If a customer buys more than one handgun in five days, the 
store must report the sales to ATF, but the MAK-90 comes with no such restriction. 
Nor does ammunition. Some gun-store owners say they voluntarily tip off ATF to 
suspicious buyers, usually after the sale is made and the money collected. </p>
<p icap="off"> <span class="tn4"> <b>'Bubba Did It'</b> </span></p>
<p icap="on"> When Gun Land's owner, William Ben Woodall, answers the phone, he 
doesn't use his real name. "Tell 'em Bubba did it," he laughs. "Bubba" says there's 
no limit to the number of guns that someone can buy in Florida. He says he'd probably 
call ATF if someone came in to buy hundreds of semiautomatic rifles, but that 
if the person "looked right and acted right" and passed the NICS test--the National 
Instant Criminal Background Check System, which requires gun-shop owners to call 
ATF and check whether a client is a felon or is otherwise prohibited from buying 
guns--he'd have no problem. Such a purchase, he says, is ultimately a customer's 
right. "Cars kill more people than guns," he says. </p>
<p> Weapons sold over the counter can quickly find themselves bound by air for 
distant countries. Since September 11, 2001, Customs has stepped up its monitoring 
of outbound small aircraft, but such inspections are aimed more at stopping the 
delivery of components used in weapons of mass destruction, like triggering devices 
or plutonium, than at halting gun shipments. McBride says we should also be concerned 
about guns. Recalling a 1985 rampage by one guerrilla group, he says, "The M-19 
raided and assaulted the Palace of Justice in Colombia, killing 115 people, eleven 
Supreme Court justices, and wiped out the Supreme Court of the country of Colombia. 
And these were guns that were subsequently traced back to the United States." 
</p>
<p> McBride says South Florida investigators came to see a connection between 
purchases here and violence abroad. "We would see, all of a sudden, a rash of 
large gun purchases, a large quantity of gun purchases throughout South Florida. 
We would find that then, a month or two months later, we would see a coup take 
place in Haiti." McBride adds that Florida is especially attractive to South and 
Central America, "because of our geographic location [and] the ease with which 
firearms can be secured here." </p>
<p style="margin-top: 18px" class="tn4"> <b>Guns and the War on Terror</b> </p>
<p icap="on"> After September 11, Attorney General Ashcroft told the nation, "It's 
our position at the Justice Department and the position of this Administration 
that we need to unleash every possible tool in the fight against terrorism, and 
to do so promptly." The resulting USA Patriot Act includes broad changes in surveillance, 
information sharing and intelligence tools available to law enforcement. Although 
the "Patriot" part of the act's title refers to "Providing Appropriate Tools Required 
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism," the act contains no new provisions for the 
monitoring or control of firearms. </p>
<p> One tool became apparent in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks, when agents 
from ATF asked the FBI to cross-check a list of terrorist suspects against NICS 
records of approved gun purchasers. The records ATF wanted the FBI to examine 
were the normal background check records of potential gun purchasers, which are 
kept for ninety days. But when the FBI began its NICS checks, Attorney General 
Ashcroft and Justice Department officials stepped in and told the FBI it was out 
of bounds. </p>
<p> "This decision by the Attorney General was surprising in that he didn't place 
officer safety and the security of the American people first," says a former official 
at the Treasury Department, which oversees ATF. Kenneth James, recently appointed 
to the firearms committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, 
agrees. "If we have some form of identifying who of these terrorists may have 
had guns, that just makes our investigation and the people who are out there on 
the frontlines that much safer." </p>
<p> Ashcroft defended his decision on legal grounds. "It's my belief," he said, 
"that the United States Congress specifically outlaws and bans the use of the 
NICS database--and that's the use of approved purchase records--for weapons checks 
on possible terrorists or on anyone else." But an internal Justice Department 
memo shows that Ashcroft's own office of legal counsel believed otherwise and 
supported the longtime FBI practice of using NICS records in criminal investigations. 
"We see nothing in the NICS regulations," the memo read, "that prohibits the FBI 
from deriving additional benefits from checking audit log records." </p>
<p> Mathew Nosanchuk once worked for the Justice Department, where he became an 
expert on law enforcement's use of NICS. He now works for the Violence Policy 
Center, a Washington-based gun-control group. Ashcroft, Nosanchuk says, is forcing 
the FBI and ATF to "conduct the post-September 11 investigation with one hand 
tied behind their backs." Nosanchuk says Ashcroft's stance "really underscores 
his allegiance to the agenda of the gun lobby." The National Rifle Association's 
position is that NICS "has serious flaws that must be corrected." </p>
<p> According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA and related pro-gun 
lobbyists contributed $48,900 to Ashcroft's failed 2000 Senate re-election bid. 
Federal Election Commission filings indicate the NRA also spent $239,000 on independent 
TV and radio ads, billboards and bumper stickers supporting Ashcroft's campaign. 
Later, the NRA Political Victory Fund spent more than $100,000 on an endorsement 
letter and $19,000 on bumper stickers at the time of Ashcroft's Justice Department 
confirmation. </p>
<p> Law enforcement has increasingly found guns to be a critical source of evidence 
in its investigations of terrorists and other criminal groups. It was the suspects' 
outdoor shooting activities that led to the October arrests of four alleged Al 
Qaeda trainees in Oregon and Michigan. As Ashcroft himself pointed out, members 
of the group "acquired various firearms and engaged in weapons training and physical 
training in preparation to fight a jihad." Among the detainees swept up in the 
weeks after 9/11 were several members of Al-Fuqra, a domestic group suspected 
of at least seventeen firebombings and thirteen homicides in the United States. 
Three Al-Fuqra members were arrested and convicted of illegally buying assault 
rifles, pistols and AK-47 ammunition in rural Virginia. A prior weapons-violation 
warrant was used to detain last month's Washington-area snipers until murder charges 
could be filed. (The Bushmaster rifle the snipers used is another modified weapon 
designed to avoid the Assault Weapons Ban.) </p>
<p> Even international criminals criticize America's lax gun laws and say they 
inevitably lead to international trafficking. Conor Claxton, who was convicted 
of smuggling more than 100 guns from Florida to the Irish Republican Army in 1999, 
said the group did its shopping near Fort Lauderdale because "we don't have gun 
shows in Ireland. You see things here like you never imagined." Rafael Ceruelos, 
who has lived in Spain since serving time for his offenses, says, "The right to 
bear arms made sense 200 years ago but not now." He adds, "As long as people can 
buy weapons in gun shops, there will be people from other countries who want to 
do business with them."</i></p> </p>
