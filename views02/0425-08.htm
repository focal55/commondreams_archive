<i>“I know not what course
others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”
</i>—Patrick Henry, 1775
<p>
Does it make sense to terrorize Afghanistan and to Talibanize the US in
order to fight terrorism and the Taliban? Does the US have to act as
viciously and violently as Osama bin Laden in an effort to vanquish him?
<p>
Bush launched a <i>crusade</i> against a <i>jihad</i>, making war abroad
to bring peace, abrogating freedoms at home to bolster democracy. Which
part of this makes sense? 
<p>
In Bush’s war against Afghanistan, the US bombed the UN (four UN
minesweepers, in a country of some ten million mines, became the first
fatalities), the Red Cross (which was hit twice), mosques (one was hit as
Ramadan began), villages, old-age homes, houses, and many other civilian
sites of everyday life for ordinary people, destroying their lives,
families, and communities.
<p>
In the US, there is a different sort of threat. Bush’s belief that “there
ought to be limits to freedom” and his simplistic, polarizing warning of
September 20<sup>th</sup> that “either you are with us, or you are with
the terrorists” sets the harsh tone for the administration. Bush’s Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer followed up on September 26<sup>th</sup> with his
threat “to all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch
what they do”. Attorney General John Ashcroft, not to be left out of the
fascistic fun, admonished people concerned about rights and liberties on
December 6<sup>th</sup>. Speaking to a Senate committee, he said: “to
those who scare peaceloving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my
message is this: Your tactics aid terrorists, for they erode our national
unity and diminish our resolve. They give ammunition to America’s
enemies, and pause to America’s friends.” What a baseless, horrible, and
anti-democratic charge to level against citizens exercising their
fundamental rights. This is precisely why we have, and should highly
value, our First Amendment. How authoritarian and cruel to say to people
who disagree, or are fearful, that what they are doing is comparable to
terrorism and treason!
<p>
Scores of people deemed “other”—Arabs and South Asians, Israelis and
Central Asians, Muslims and Jews—have been xenophobically harassed and
attacked by the government, corporations, and vigilantes in the US. There
have been approximately 2,000 people held in secret detention, mostly
held in solitary confinement and incommunicado, most likely with no
connection to terrorism, all of whose names and charges are unknown to
us. Additionally, there are possibly 5,000 or more people—primarily
Middle Eastern men, though anyone may be considered “fair” game—to be
“questioned” by Ashcroft’s deputies.
<p>
So secretive and duplicitous the Bush Administration has been that it
won’t divulge the evidence against bin Laden it claims to have and has
promised to publicize. Even if we already reasonably <i>assume</i> his
guilt, direct evidence is still of course necessary. The administration
also does not release any information about those it detains, while the
government increases its (formerly unconstitutional) powers of
surveillance, search, and seizure. The levels of secrecy and deception
practiced by this administration—notoriously including the revelation
that Bush instituted a bunkerized “shadow government”, secret from even
the Congress—are alarming to say the least. At worst, it is another step
in Bush’s quiet coup against democracy.
<p>
Further erosion of civil rights comes via military tribunals, a form of
judicial martial law. Speaking of Bush’s executive order establishing
secret military tribunals, Yale Professor Rogers M. Smith says that<br>

<dl>
<dd>The order allows military officials within the United States to
arrest aliens on mere suspicion of terrorism, without having to show
probable cause; to try them entirely in secret; to use any evidence
against them that military officials judge to have ‘probative value,’
even if it is mere hearsay or illegally obtained; to convict them on
simple preponderance of such evidence, rather than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt; to convict them by a vote of two-thirds of the military
judges, without a requirement of unanimity, much less trial by jury; and
to sentence them to death, without appeal to the civilian courts.
<p>

</dl>
Additionally, it is Bush <i>himself</i> who personally decides who
gets charged in these kangaroo courts and it is Secretary of Defense
(sic) Rumsfeld himself who <i>personally</i> has to OK the defense
lawyer—keeping in mind that Rumsfeld and Bush are also the commanders of
the judge and the prosecutor. And, according to Ashcroft’s Congressional
testimony, Bush and Rumsfeld <i>are</i> the appellate process.&nbsp; The
Bush Administration sounds more like a monarchy every day.
<p>
William Safire, the conservative <i>New York Times</i> essayist, argues
that each military tribunal would be empowered to “conceal evidence by
citing national security, make up its own rules, find a defendant guilty
even if a third of the officers disagree, and execute the alien with no
review by any civilian court”. Excising the judicial branch, it would be
the executive branch alone that is the “investigator, prosecutor, judge,
jury and jailer or executioner”. How convenient! This is what Bush calls
a “full and fair trial”. This type of Orwellian authoritarianism is not
entirely surprising, however, given that Bush has three times publicly
said, as recently as December 18<sup>th</sup> and July 27<sup>th</sup>
2001, that things would be much easier if he were the dictator—for him,
that is.
<p>
Many legal experts have criticized the use of military tribunals. A
letter signed by more than 300 law professors, for example, describes the
military tribunals as “legally deficient, unnecessary and unwise”. The
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> simply calls Bush’s military tribunals
“indefensible”, arguing that we shouldn’t be “shredding the
Constitution—which applies to all ‘persons,’ not just citizens”. In 1866,
other legal experts also took issue with military tribunals. In <i>Ex
Parte Milligan</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that “martial law,
established on such a basis, destroys every guarantee of the Constitution
and effectively renders the military independent of and superior to the
civil powers...Civil liberty and this kind of martial law cannot endure
together; one or the other must perish...Martial rule can never exist
where the Courts are open...”
<p>
It is <i>never</i> an inopportune time to assert one’s rights and to
speak up on behalf of justice. Indeed, as Hillel asks, “if not now,
when?” The attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup> were clearly “crimes
against humanity”, especially based on their scope and scale, their
horror and human toll, the number of people killed and that they were
from so many countries, and the number of survivors still terrified.
Bush, however, is treating these heinous crimes as “acts of war”, even
though he earlier and correctly compared Al Qaeda to the mafia. It is an
instructive comparison. 
<p>
When trying to stop and punish the mafia (not to mention mass murderers
such as Kaczinski, Pinochet, McVeigh, and Milosovic), we appropriately
attempt to locate, capture, arrest, arraign, impartially try, convict,
and imprison the guilty people, giving them access to their accusers, the
evidence, and independent defense counsel, following the rules of law and
the norms of justice. We do not, it should be needless to say, carpet
bomb and destroy entire blocks, neighborhoods, towns, cities, and
countries for the purposes of tracking down individuals or even groups of
suspected criminals. 
<p>
The rule of law simply means that the rules need to follow the law—not
the fear, not the fad, not the anger, and not the president—without
exception.
