<p>This should have been the Democrats' year. 
<p>The country is still mired in recession. Polls consistently have shown that 
the Republicans' positions on such basic policy issues as the environment and 
the economy are decidedly unpopular. The connection of top administration officials 
with scandal-plagued corporations provided ample opportunities for a populist 
message against corruption and in support of economic justice. 
<p>Despite this, the Democrats became the first party out of office to lose one 
of the houses of Congress in an off-year election. It was the first time in a 
century that a Republican president saw his party gain seats in an off-year election 
and only the second time since 1934 that a sitting president's party did not lose 
seats in Congress 
<p>Instead of emulating the hugely successful 1994 Republican strategy of aggressively 
challenging the incumbent president and his party's Congressional leadership, 
the Democrats instead decided to work on a consensus-building approach with the 
Republican administration. They even went as far as supporting President George 
W. Bush's demand that he be granted the authority to invade Iraq without the legally-required 
mandate from the United Nations Security Council. In addition, the majority of 
Democrats went on record praising his support for last spring's attacks by Israel's 
right-wing government against civilian areas of the occupied West Bank. The Democrats 
went as far as supporting Republican calls authorizing the use of military force 
to free any citizen of the United States or an allied nation detained for war 
crimes by the United Nations' International Criminal Court in The Hague. 
<p>As a result, many thousands of rank-and-file Democrats, longtime supporters 
of peace and human rights issues, voted for the Green Party or simply did not 
vote. Thousands more voted reluctantly for the Democratic nominee but did not 
put in the volunteer time or campaign contributions they would have otherwise, 
angered that the Democrats had shifted so far to the right. 
<p>It is noteworthy that both incumbent Democratic senators and five out of the 
six Democratic House incumbents who were defeated supported the Iraq war resolution. 
By contrast, no incumbent who opposed the Democratic Congressional leadership's 
support of President Bush's war plans lost, with the exception of Rep. James Maloney 
of Connecticut, who was pitted against a popular moderate female Republican incumbent 
in a redrawn district. 
<p>It is difficult to shift public attention to domestic issues in times of international 
tension. Making a strong case against the Bush administration' s war plans, its 
support for repressive governments and its assaults on well-respected international 
institutions would have almost certainly resulted in a galvanizing of the Democratic 
Party faithful as well as large numbers of independents, insuring a Democratic 
victory. 
<p>The Democratic leadership should have recognized that calls for prescription 
drug benefits for seniors while the nation is concerned about an illegal, unnecessary 
and possibly devastating war simply did not catch the imagination of the voting 
public. 
<p>This was particularly problematic in that the Democrats were unable to explain 
how they intended to pay for such benefits while refusing to reverse recently-enacted 
tax cuts and in authorizing a military campaign that will cost up to $200 billion. 
<p>Hopefully, the Democrats will learn the lesson for Tuesday's devastating defeat 
and decide to replace their discredited leadership with those who have the integrity 
and political smarts to return them to majority status.
