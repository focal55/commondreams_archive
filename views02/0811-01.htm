<p>On Aug. 2, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0803-02.htm">ordered</a> 
the U.S. Department of Justice to release the names of more than 1,180 individuals 
the government has detained in connection with its post-Sept. 11 investigation 
of terrorist activities. 
<P> It was a victory for our democratic form of government. The 47-page ruling 
opens by stating a premise most Americans believe: 
<P> &quot;Secret arrests are a concept odious to a democratic society and profoundly 
antithetical to the bedrock values that characterize a free and open one such 
as ours.&quot; 
<P> In 1954, former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, in his An Almanac 
of Liberty, wrote: &quot;It would be unthinkable that in this country a person 
could be spirited away, held incommunicado, tried in secret, and executed.&quot; 
<P> Except for the portion of his statement regarding execution, the unthinkable 
has now become not only thinkable but hard reality in the United States. 
<P> In response, 23 civil rights, human rights and civil liberties organizations 
filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Justice for the release of the 
information in December. The organizations asked the government to release the 
names of the individuals detained, when and where they were arrested and then 
jailed, the names of attorneys representing detainees and the government&#39;s 
policy directives regarding arresting and holding detainees. 
<P> Judge Kessler ordered the government to release the names of all detainees 
within 15 days - except those names sealed by specific court order and those of 
detainees who have signed a statement requesting their identity be kept confidential. 
<P> &quot;Here, the government has used its arrest power to detain individuals 
as part of an investigation that is widespread in its scope and secrecy. Plaintiffs 
voice grave concerns about the abuse of this power, ranging from denial of the 
right to counsel and consular notification, to discriminatory and arbitrary detention, 
to the failure to file charges for prolonged periods of detention, to mistreatment 
of detainees in custody,&quot; Judge Kessler noted. 
<P> Of the nearly 1,200 individuals detained in the government&#39;s original 
sweep, according to court records, approximately 130 were sent back to their home 
countries for infractions of immigration law, less than 25 for minor crimes, while 
73 face federal criminal charges unrelated to terrorism and 74 are still being 
held in custody by immigration officials. 
<P> No one arrested in the sweeps after the Sept. 11 attacks has been charged 
in connection with those attacks. 
<P> &quot;Unquestionably,&quot; Judge Kessler wrote, &quot;the public&#39;s interest 
in learning the identities of those arrested and detained is essential to verifying 
whether the government is operating within the bounds of the law.&quot; 
<P> And unquestionably, that political philosophy is the cornerstone of our democracy. 
<P> The government had argued that the release of the names of detainees might 
inform terrorists about the direction the investigation was taking and &quot;could 
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.&quot; Further, 
it argued, disclosure of the names could allow terrorists to create false and 
misleading evidence. 
<P> Judge Kessler found all three lines of reasoning highly speculative, unconvincing 
and without supporting evidence. 
<P> The judge also found the government&#39;s treatment of material witness information 
&quot;deeply troubling.&quot; A material witness is not accused of a crime, but 
has been arrested because it is believed his or her testimony is important to 
a criminal proceeding. A material witness can be held only until his or her testimony 
can be secured by deposition. Yet the government has kept everything about these 
individuals secret. 
<P> &quot;The public has no idea whether there are 40, 400 or possibly more people 
in detention on material witness warrants,&quot; the judge wrote. The government&#39;s 
rationale for &quot;withholding the identities of material witnesses is fundamentally 
wrong as a matter of law,&quot; she added. 
<P> In this secrecy-addicted administration, even its own policy directives are 
clandestine. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the government 
released only two documents regarding &quot;policy directives&quot; about the 
detainees, and the FBI, according to Judge Kessler, didn&#39;t even bother to 
conduct a search for the documents requested, nor did it provide an explanation 
as to why no search was done. 
<P> It isn&#39;t credible that federal law enforcement agencies as well as FBI, 
Justice and Immigration and Naturalization Service offices throughout the nation 
were told how to proceed in the post-Sept. 11 sweeps without creating a single 
document. 
<P> The Justice Department did win one victory. Judge Kessler agreed with the 
government&#39;s reasons for withholding the dates and locations of arrest, detention 
and release: Dates and locations could be useful to terrorist organizations seeking 
to finding out the Justice Department&#39;s arrest strategy. Further, the information 
could jeopardize the safety of those who run the detention facilities and the 
inmates held there. 
<P> This nation&#39;s history has repeatedly shown that an independent judiciary 
is essential to holding reluctant administrations to constitutional and democratic 
standards. 
<P> Judge Kessler&#39;s ruling upholds those standards.
