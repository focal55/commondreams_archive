I could be in heaven. This might be my heaven: no Valkyries or virgins, no petitioning at Peter's gates. Instead, a walk in beauty, with a soft mist of rain on my face, falcons soaring, trees budding, and the sun striking through the pearly clouds in shining columns of light. I call this swell of sunlight, right out of a Renaissance painting, "God peering from the heavens." It always seems to come after rains. 
<P>
Oh, I can't forget the wind. the wind's at my back, pushing me up the rolling Stanford foothills, playing a low whistle as I watch a dozen varieties of bird fly by. This is some of the most beautiful land in the world. It reminds me of Tuscany, a place where classical painters shaped the Western image of society and of the heavens. It makes me feel at peace. 
<P>
Peace is hard to come by these days. I search for it. More than that, I'm trying to help create it. In the six months since September 11, I realized I have to begin the search for peace by changing myself as well as trying to change others. A decade in journalism had left me spent. It's hard to pick at the wounds of society-ostensibly to help heal them-and then see the same old four-letter-word happen over and over again. Race relations have taken a measurable nosedive; the economy is in the crapper (with journalists among those rapidly losing their jobs); and AIDS is the leading cause of death for African-Americans aged 25-44, a demographic I happen to be squarely in the middle in. Part of my job is trying to explain how crises like these happen, but sometimes I can't even explain it to myself. 
<P>
 On September 11, I was on my way back from a restful visit with my father, brother, and family in Zimbabwe, a country having issues of its own. I got off the plane in bustling Johannesburg, which reminds me of a mostly-black Atlanta or L.A., and my host told me that the World Trade towers had just collapsed. I remember walking out to his car in the bright sunshine and thinking, "You are so deluded. That is not possible." I really only believed it when the wife of his colleague at the Steve Biko Foundation called in from New York and told us it was all true. 
<P>
Later I went to my hotel room in suburban Sandtown, an immaculate area with a massive luxury mall, and watched the footage of the planes over and over again. Watching the replays was ritualistic, obsessive, like a disturbed child banging his or her head against the wall. I checked email and found love notes from the people close to me, sent love notes back. But when I wrote "love," I should have written, "fear" instead. I didn't feel love right then. I feared for them, myself, the world. 
<P>
I still do, but back then I remember feeling a dullness inside that threatened to overwhelem me. When I was finally able to come home a few days later, the rubble was still smoking. I could see it from my apartment, the plumes of dark smoke silhouetted against the pink dawn sky. Our flight from Johnanesburg was one of the first to land at JFK and that airport was vacant, as if someone had set off one of the weapons of mass destruction that killed the people and left the concrete intact. It was empty as I felt, cold as I felt. 
<P>
A couple of nights later I cried, and I'm not the crying kind. I cried for the 25% of people in Zimbabwe infected with HIV. My brother's mother's family is thinking about opening a private orphanage to take care of all the children left behind by the dying. I cried because HIV has hit my family in the United States as well. I cried because I knew, even then, that we were bound to go to war. I cried because I hadn't cried in a long time, and everything stored up was going to kill me if I didn't let it loose. 
<P>
I cried and then I flew. In the next few days I flew from New York to Florida to California, drifting through the empty airports to my new home. When I met my new colleagues on the Stanford fellowship, we shared feelings of being in suspended animation-journalists without deadlines, warriors without swords. At first I felt guilty for sitting on the sidelines, then I settled into using the time as I'd planned.trying new angles, deeper angles, on figuring out how we got here in the first place. I took history classes that spanned the 15th Century to the present, which is at least the span we need to understand the earth-shattering tussle between Islam and Christianity. I began taking dance and art classes that are as relevant to understanding and changing this world as any textbook. I started really listening to the people around me, incredible people who've been to Afghanistan and beyond. 
<P>
Several of my colleagues here at Stanford have been war correspondents, seen the dead and the dying and almost been one of them.  No one cares about what they write, or at least sometimes it has seemed  that way. 
<P>
Take the story of Ian Stewart, who covered the brutal civil war in Sierra Leone, where combatants chop off the hands of civilians. His editors wouldn' t run his stories. And then he got shot in the head, almost killed. His cameraman <I>was</I> killed. The bullet tunneled from the front to the back of his skull, and it took days to fly him to surgery. Now he's written a book, "Freetown Ambush," about what it took to cover this war no one cared about, and why we should. (For one, the diamonds on your finger, in your ears, or around your neck could have been dug by a civilian whose limbs were later chopped off, and/or helped fund the Taliban.) He's been featured on "Oprah." His near-death story may do what his reporting alone could not-make people care. 
<P>
What makes people care? How do we open our hearts to caring about others? I think of something that Siobahn Darrow, another former war correspondent (for CNN) said on a panel broadcast on CSPAN.  There's an informal calculus in the newsroom, she said, where one American life equals ten European lives, equals ten thousand African lives. According to this calculus, Ian's stories barely had a chance. The calculus of human life continues. More Afghani civilians, most of who support the U.S.,  have now died in the War Against Terrorism than Americans died on September 11. We don't want to think about that. As a memo from one Florida newspaper revealed, even some journalists don't want to write about that. Even if we ultimately think these deaths were unvaoidable, we should examine them, mourn them, the same way we've demanded the world mourn our losses.  If others cry for us why can 't we cry for them? 
<P>
Maybe we're afraid we'd never stop crying. Listening to the radio for just two minutes this morning I heard about the desperation in Argentina, where the currency has imploded and more than a third of the nation lives in poverty; and a report from India, where Hindus and Muslims have been killing each other. It's always the cousins who fight, from Israel and Palestine onward. And on some level we're all cousins, aren't we? 
<P>
	
	
<p>At least it seems that way to me. Reaching outward several rings, my own family, through blood and marriage, encompasses people of African-American, Zimbabwean, Italian, Russian, and Vietnamese heritages and nationalities. One of my dearest friends has parents who immigrated from Uganda and Austria, and her family stretches from Africa to Europe to Asia to the Americas. Even if blood doesn't connect us, living at the cross-section of the modern world does. That's what America is, a place where we meet, fight, love, fight, learn, and fight. I wish we fought less. 
<P>
 <b>"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings has thou ordained strength." </b> 
<P>
One night I was sitting after dinner with a few of my colleagues, a Stanford professor, and his six year old daughter. She's one of these precocious New York children who takes about 20 after-school activities and knows more about world affairs than people thrice her age, but still loves coloring and goofing off. As the grownups talked about war, she and I sat on the floor drawing with crayons. I asked her offhand, "What does freedom mean to you?" Without hesitation she said, "Freedom means not having to fight, and Americans aren't free because we have to fight." 
<P>
I carry this with me, think about it every day since she's said it. For a speech in October, I researched the way my people, black people, have to fight every war this country is in. Forty percent of women in the armed forces are black, and eighteen percent of the men. When we, America, goes to war, we, black America, is more likely to go than anyone. Rich people go to war these days by choice only. I'm not rich, but I am financially free enough not to fight; mentally free enough to worry about the people fighting for me. Half of my mother's generation of my family was in the military. I know freedom, the kind we enjoy, does not come without a cost. 
<P>
Can we even imagine a world where we are completely free, free from the ravages of war and the burden of ignoring it when someone else is dying? To do that, it requires faith When the Bible says, "Oh ye of little faith," I raise my hand.. The passage from Matthew continues, "take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?" Could I also take no thought of war? I would like, in the words of a six year old, to be truly free. 
<P>
Waging peace is out of fashion these days. Yet Stanford professor Clay Carson, editor of the Martin Luther King, Jr., papers, points out that the overthrow of Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic was part of a Ghandi and King-style nonviolence movement. A year ago, hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets after he threatened to nullify the election he lost. Now he's on trial in the Hague for crimes against humanity, including mass murder. We may not be able to avoid waging war, but we can certainly learn from and celebrate the hard-won lessons of nonviolent change, which only takes place when people stand together. 
<P>I question my faith but I must have some, or else I would despair at the penchant for self-destruction we humans seem to enjoy. My faith is not the faith of Bin Laden, a fundamentalist who sanctifies killing, or Falwell, a fundamentalist who blames the killing on Americans he doesn't like, from gays and lesbians to the ACLU. (As former war correspondent Debra Copaken Cogen wrote in the afterward to her memoir "Shutterbabe," "Jerry Bin Laden; Osama Fallwell.")  Instead, I have faith in us, in our ability to change the world for the better. That will and has to take many forms, from improving education to protecting the earth we walk on. In the past months I've met some incredible people changing the world from their communities outward, including a 19 year old AIDS prevention worker and a 21 year-old environmental justice activist who's been at it for over five years. The rest of us can't be too scared or too self-conscious to work towards what we believe in. As I said to one group of college students-don't be overly worried about screwing up the world, it's pretty screwed up already! 
<P>
What's changed for me since September 11 is that I have more faith. I have to. May the wind be always at your back.
<P>
Peace, <br>
