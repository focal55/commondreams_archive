<p>The collapse of Richard Gephardt's leadership of the House Democratic Caucus 
did not occur on November 5, when the party lost seats in an election where history 
and economic trends suggested that it should have gained them. That result was 
simply a confirmation of the crisis that had been evident for more than a year. 
From the first days of George W. Bush's selected-not-elected presidency, it was 
clear that Gephardt was unprepared to serve as the leader of Congressional opposition 
to a Republican president. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 
he simply stopped trying. That doomed Democratic chances of taking over the House 
in 2002, as Gephardt failed to define an opposition agenda and took positions 
out of sync with his own caucus. </p>
<p> That was never more evident than on October 10 when, after Gephardt helped 
craft the resolution authorizing Bush to launch a unilateral attack on Iraq, the 
majority of House Democrats voted against the plan. In surprising result, 126 
House Democrats opposed it with only 81 joining their leader Gephardt in supporting 
it. </p>
<p> Among the Democrats who opposed the resolution was House Minority Whip Nancy 
Pelosi, the California Democrat who won the caucus' Number 2 leadership position 
last year. Pelosi, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence, argued -- as did Senate Intelligence Committee chair Bob Graham, 
D-Florida -- that the Bush administration had failed to make a case for its position. 
"I have seen no evidence or intelligence that suggests that Iraq indeed poses 
an imminent threat to our nation," she said, in one of the most powerful indictments 
of the resolution. "If the Administration has that information, they have not 
shared it with the Congress." </p>
<p> Pelosi's stance placed her in direct opposition not just to the Bush administration 
but to Gephardt. And it stirred immediate discussion among House Democrats about 
what it might be like to be a genuine opposition party. An aggressive progressive, 
Pelosi has long argued that Democrats need to clearly distinguish themselves from 
Republicans on domestic and international issues. Now, she can point to Tuesday's 
election results -- in which Democrats who opposed the Bush agenda on taxes and 
war ran better than those who compromised with the administration -- as confirmation 
of her view. </p>
<p> With Gephardt stepping down as minority leader, Pelosi is running hard to 
replace him. She is not starting from scratch. Speculation about Gephardt's departure 
-- in order to focus on a 2004 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination 
-- was rampant in the House even before the election, and Pelosi has been quietly 
organizing support. But she was not alone in that endeavor. Another prominent 
House Democrat, Caucus chair Martin Frost, D-Texas, has been running just as hard 
as Pelosi. </p>
<p> With Gephardt's announcement that he is stepping aside, the contest for the 
top Democratic leadership post in the House will speed up. Democrats are set to 
choose a replacement for the minority leader on November 14. Pelosi is reported 
to have collected commitments from 110 House Democrats to support her candidacy. 
That would be more than enough to secure the position in a House that, depending 
on final results from Tuesday, will include 204 Democratic representatives and 
five delegates from US territories and the District of Columbia. </p>
<p> Commitments of this sort are no guarantee of support in the closed caucus 
vote, however, and Pelosi's backers do not intend to coast through the next several 
days. They know they will be involved in a serious internal campaign against Frost, 
one of the ablest strategists in the House. </p>
<p> It would be a mistake to see the Pelosi-Frost fight as a clear left-right 
struggle. Pelosi is one of the most progressive members of the House, with a voting 
record that frequently displays 100 percent support for the positions advanced 
by organized labor, environmental and consumer groups. But Frost, despite his 
Texas roots, is no southern conservative. He too has earned his share of 100 percent 
AFL-CIO ratings over the years. Pelosi has support from some conservative Democrats, 
who see her as an able fund raiser and an effective spokesperson for the caucus. 
Frost has liberal supporters who respect the leadership role he's played in coordinating 
congressional campaigns over the years. </p>
<p> That said, there are clear distinctions. Where Pelosi was a leading foe of 
the Iraq resolution, Frost supported it. Pelosi has in recent years been an outspoken 
critic of the corporate free-trade agenda, while Frost has a mixed record that 
includes a vote to permanently normalize trade relations with China. (That vote 
by Frost so angered local United Auto Workers members that, in 2000, they removed 
desks that had been donated for use in the congressman's campaign office. He has 
since been more supportive of labor's position on trade issues.) </p>
<p> The biggest difference between Frost and Pelosi came through as they staked 
out their visions for how House Democrats should position themselves in the next 
Congress. The day after Tuesday's vote, Frost's spokesman Tom Eisenhauer told 
reporters, "The country moved to the right yesterday. And House Democrats won't 
win the majority by moving further to the left." </p>
<p> Pelosi, for her part, is arguing that Democrats need to distinguish themselves 
from Republicans. "To win back the House in 2004," she says, "we need a unified 
party that will draw clear distinctions between our vision of the future and that 
espoused by the Republicans."</p> </p>
