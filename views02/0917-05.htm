<p>The debate on a possible pre-emptive war by the United States against Iraq 
has so far centered on elaborate cost-benefit equations of how much it would cost 
in money, blood and geopolitical influence to topple Saddam Hussein -- and who 
would replace him. What has not yet been discussed are the consequences for global 
governance if a pre-emptive strike is successful. Suppose everything goes right, 
democracy is restored and the Iraqi threat is removed at low cost (a tall order) 
-- the American initiative will set an important precedent, one sure to be invoked 
by potential imitators.</P>
<P>The first, the widest and the most dangerous interpretation is that it would 
legitimate the proposition that whenever Country A believes, rightly or wrongly, 
that there is a &#34;clear and present danger&#34; from Country B, it is entitled 
to attack first. The 19th-century military historian Carl von Clausewitz claimed 
that war is a continuation of foreign policy by other means, and that attack is 
often the best defense. A successful U.S. pre-emptive strike against Iraq will, 
in effect, reinstate both Clausewitz propositions.</P>
<P>Under this doctrine, Pakistan could perceive a clear and present danger from 
India and attack first, or vice versa. Israel and the Arab states could use the 
same logic to launch quick first strikes; for that matter, Iraq could launch a 
pre-emptive strike against the United States, on the legitimate pretext that it 
perceives a clear and imminent threat from the latter. In fact, an immediate imitator 
is already manifest: Last week, Vladimir Putin invoked the Bush doctrine to threaten 
pre-emptive action against neighboring Georgia, which he accused of harboring 
Chechen rebels.</P>
<P>The 20th century has seen two world wars, plus countless regional wars. After 
1945, the idea was to outlaw war as an instrument of policy and rely instead on 
collective security mechanisms. In addition, the mutually assured destruction 
theory of deterrence created a remarkable stability between the superpowers until 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both parties renounced first strikes.</P>
<P>Legitimating unilateral pre-emptive war would set back the clock to pre-Second 
World War parameters and negate most of the advances in global governance achieved 
since then.</P>
<P>Let's consider a second, slightly milder interpretation: that unilateral pre-emptive 
strikes are fine as long as they are initiated by a strong power against a much 
weaker opponent. During the Cold War, the former Soviet Union possessed frightening 
weapons of mass destruction. Russia still does and so does China. Should all these 
states be attacked pre-emptively? Pragmatic geopoliticians will answer no; let 
us just attack the weaker states. The stronger states can be allowed to get away 
with murder. The precedent then would be: It is fine to attack first as long as 
you are sure of winning. This notion is almost as dangerous as the first.</P>
<P>The third interpretation is that if the cause is good, pre-emptive strikes 
are justified. The &#34;cause&#34; may be restoring democracy, effecting &#34;regime 
change&#34; or whatever the attacking power believes in. We find ourselves on 
a very slippery slope -- because the justice of the cause is a matter of subjective 
interpretation. It could be used by Islamic fundamentalists against the infidels, 
or by world revolutionaries against capitalism. Besides, citing &#34;the restoration 
of democracy&#34; in the case of Iraq carries the obvious flaw that the United 
States and others have never hesitated to back dictatorial regimes (including 
Saddam Hussein's in Iraq in the 1980s), if it is in their interest to do so.</P>
<P>The fourth interpretation is that pre-emptive strikes constitute a privilege 
that belongs only to the United States by virtue of its position as sole superpower 
and, therefore, world sheriff. This interpretation would be plausible if the United 
States were to accept intervening, like the Lone Ranger, to right all wrongs -- 
if all the injustices in the world could be corrected by American power.</P>
<P>As distasteful as that might be to third parties, this form of unilateralism 
would be at least internally consistent and might be accepted, if clear rules 
of engagement were made explicit.</P>
<P>But the current situation, where proposed interventions are not only unilateral 
but entirely conditioned and motivated by U.S. national interest (rather than 
global interests), is obviously not acceptable to either allies or foes of the 
United States. Rather than contributing to world order, American unilateralism 
will severely destabilize it.</P>
<P>In the end, it is the combination of &#34;unilateral&#34; and &#34;pre-emptive&#34; 
that is the dangerous mix. Unilateral defensive war is still quite acceptable, 
as when the United States responded to the unprovoked 9/11 attack originating 
in Afghanistan. Multilateral pre-emptive military interventions sanctioned by 
a legitimate world body to right obvious wrongs, stop genocides or for general 
humanitarian purposes are not only acceptable but desirable -- much like police 
raids intended to nip in the bud terrorist or criminal activities. Prevention 
is a virtue. But unilateral pre-emptive war in the name of national interest opens 
up a Pandora's box much more dangerous that the problem it addresses.</P>
<P>The Westphalian World Order, born of the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, entrusted 
the governance of this planet to the juxtaposition of a number of national sovereignties. 
This system is rapidly becoming obsolete and must be reformed in favor of some 
forms of supranationality -- that is, the subordination of national sovereignty 
to higher global values.</P>
<P>The reform must involve new and improved versions of multilateralism, including 
better intergovernmental institutions. Until then, the use of force between nations 
must be sanctioned by a legitimate world body and cannot be left to the arbitrary 
self-interest of the current world heavyweight champion acting solely in its own 
self-interest.</P>
<P>To do otherwise is to let slip the dogs of war. And this could make the previous 
century, with its two world wars, look like a pacifist's dream.</P>
<P><I>Kimon Valaskakis was Canada's ambassador to the OECD from 1995 to 1999. 
He is currently the president of the Club of Athens, an international initiative 
involving world leaders interested in better global governance.</I></P>
