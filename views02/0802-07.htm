<p>On Saturday night Bob Dylan returns to the scene of the crime. For the first 
time since 1965 - when he appalled traditionalists by playing electrified rock'n'roll 
- he will be appearing at the Newport folk festival. 
<P>Having been Grammied, Clintoned and Poped, Dylan has no need of Newport's belated 
seal of approval. But it is a moment worth pausing over, especially now, with 
the hard rain headed Iraq's way. 
<P>The 16 minutes of music blasted out by Dylan on that summer night 37 years 
ago were to become, in the words of Dylan's biographer, Clinton Heylin, "the most 
written-about performance in the history of rock". And not without cause. Dylan's 
clash with the milieu from which he had emerged was high drama, and more. The 
moment was culturally, politically and commercially resonant - a fulcrum of the 
American 60s. 
<P>History vindicated Dylan - and in short order. Like a Rolling Stone, booed 
at Newport, soared up the charts, detonating an explosion of pop music innovation 
and ambition (as well as pretension). But, unexpectedly, history may also end 
up vindicating Dylan's Newport opponents. One of those scandalized by the new 
sound was the folk archivist Alan Lomax, who died two weeks ago. Lomax's collections 
of American music were the foundations of Dylan's art. But when Dylan turned up 
the amps, all Lomax heard was a sellout to the forces the festival was supposed 
to challenge. 
<P>The festival had always been intertwined with the civil rights movement, giving 
northerners a taste of the freedom songs being sung on the frontline, and sending 
anthems such as Blowin' in the Wind back down south to expand the traditional 
repertoire. Also on the bill with Dylan that evening was Fannie Lou Hamer, not 
a singer but a Mississippi militant. Hamer was there because the festival organizers 
assumed the audience would share a political as well as a musical ethic. Indeed, 
to them, the two were one. 
<P>A tenet of the folk revival was that young people should aspire not merely 
to consume but to participate - in music, in public life. In contrast to the manufactured 
sound of teen-targeted pop, folk promised something enduring, authentic and collective. 
Dylan himself had declared that folk music was "the only true, valid death you 
can feel today". In that context, as folk veteran Oscar Brand explained, "the 
electric guitar represented capitalism". 
<P>It sounds far-fetched today, but Lomax, as it turned out, had a point. Dylan's 
boundary-blurring rock'n'roll helped create a new record-buying constituency, 
a milestone in the construction of today's global music industry. Now dominated 
by a handful of giant media conglomerates, it is both more centralized and more 
socially segregated as executives calibrate the music to chime with consumer demographics. 
As Lomax feared, the demands of authenticity and political independence do indeed 
clash with those of commerce (ask George Michael). 
<P>"You don't need a weatherman to know the way the wind blows" - but these days 
there is an army of well-paid weathermen advising us. You can walk into any chain 
bookstore and purchase the Rough Guide to Cult Movies or a pocket precis of the 
Madchester scene. Since 1965, capitalism's expertise in packaging the dissident 
and flogging it back to the people from whence it came has become intimidatingly 
awesome - never more so than when PriceWaterhouse-Cooper adopted The Times They 
are A-Changin'. 
<P>The Newport festival itself is not what it was. Abandoned in 1970 (because 
of what its official website terms "growing social unrest"), it was revived in 
the mid-1980s, largely stripped of political aspirations. Today it occupies a 
cozy niche in the industry. The title sponsor for this year's event is a company 
mass producing "natural juices" (it is also backed by Borders, the bookselling 
giant, and ABC television). 
<P>What will Dylan play on Saturday night? With Dylan, it's anyone's guess. However, 
one number featured in recent outings is Masters of War, his 1963 assault on the 
military-industrial complex. When he performed this in the US after September 
11, many in the audience seized on it as an indictment, not of a cabinet stuffed 
with arms dealers, but of America's enemies in the war on terror. Some fans punctuated 
the master's rendition with lusty shouts of "Death to Bin Laden". 
<P>It is unlikely Dylan will ever tell us why he chose to sing this song at this 
moment. However, it is worth noting that he plucked out the same song at the 1991 
Grammy ceremony during the Gulf war. If there is an all-out war on Iraq in the 
coming months, no one should be surprised if a new generation finds meaning in 
the old lyrics: "You fasten the triggers/for others to fire/ then you set back 
and watch/ when the death count gets higher." Or, more importantly, composes new 
ones. In doing so, they could study Dylan at Newport in 1965, in all its glorious 
contradictions, to some advantage. 
<P><i>Mike Marqusee's study of Bob Dylan will be published by Bookmarks in the 
autumn.</i>
