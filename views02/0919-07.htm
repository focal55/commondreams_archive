<p>Right after 9/11, I made a bold prediction: that the small number of players 
who determine American policy in the Middle East would soon be joined by a broadly 
based peace faction which recognizes that the Arab-Israeli conflict threatens 
American security. I was wrong. The number of players remains small. If they’ve 
made room at the table for anyone, it hasn’t been peaceniks, but hawkish Christians.</P>
<p>The reason I was wrong is that I didn’t reckon on the strength of the Zionist 
lobby. As it demonstrated by helping to bankroll successful challengers to two 
incumbent Congressmen who had spoken out for Palestinian rights—Cynthia McKinney 
of Georgia and Earl Hilliard of Alabama—the Zionist lobby is powerful and focused.</P>
<p>&quot;The score is now Jewish activists 2, anti-Israel members of Congress 
0,&quot; the <i>Jewish Press</i> crowed in its coverage of those primaries.</P>
<p>But who else said it so bluntly? One of the difficulties about discussing this 
question is that the mainstream media refuse to address it directly; it’s considered 
too sensitive. <i>The New York Times</i>’ front-page story on Ms. McKinney’s defeat 
purposely muddled the issue. Its headline read, &quot;For Black Politicians, 2 
Races Suggest a Rise of New Tactics.&quot; The Jewish lobby did not make an appearance 
until the fifth paragraph, and then in a backhanded fashion.</P>
<p>You don’t see <i>The Times </i>pussyfooting when it comes to the anti-Castro 
lobby or the National Rifle Association, two other powerful special-interest groups. 
When they muscle the system, we read faintly sinister accounts of the Arlington, 
Va., headquarters for the gun lobby and the bland, alien Wayne LaPierre, or hysterical 
interviews with nutso Castro-haters on Eighth Street in Miami.</P>
<p>Even the words &quot;Jewish lobby&quot; stick in the throat. Earlier this year, 
Chris Matthews devoted a segment on <i>Hardball </i>to the question of why European 
nations have such a different position on the Middle East than the United States 
does. The segment was moronic. It ignored a social and political reality that 
Mr. Matthews, a political veteran, knows damn well: Jews are empowered in American 
society in a way that they are not in Europe. Indeed, Jewish money may be the 
most important segment of Democrat Party fund-raising.</P>
<p>Last year, on a trip to the Middle East, <i>Times </i>columnist Thomas Friedman 
also dismissed the issue. He said that an Arab journalist approached him at a 
conference and quietly asked him about all the Jews in the media in the United 
States. Mr. Friedman stepped away, shaking his head. &quot;Wow,&quot; he wrote, 
before commenting somewhat along the lines of <i>Can you believe the conspiracy 
theories that have taken root in the Arab world?</i></P>
<p>It’s only understandable that these theories have taken root. Jews represent 
an American elite. They have money, they have power, and Ariel Sharon has explicitly 
called upon them to use their influence over the American political process.</P>
<p>You’re just not allowed to say so in mixed company. Talking about &quot;Jewish 
influence&quot; reminds people of the Nazis. Abe Foxman is ready at a moment’s 
notice to insist on the Jewish identity as victim. Any acknowledgment of the large 
Jewish presence in the American establishment would start up anti-Semitism in 
this country, it is thought. (The same concerns probably caused <i>Seinfeld </i>to 
prevaricate about its Jewishness by unconvincingly labeling George, Kramer and 
Elaine as goyim.)</P>
<p>The problem is that the Zionist lobby is too important not to talk about. It’s 
a significant institution, and its moods and tone affect all of our interests. 
But the best reporting on the lobby happens at the periphery. For instance, the 
writer Michael Massing did a searching piece on the Zionist lobby in <i>The American 
Prospect </i>earlier this year, in which he showed that the lobby’s goal is to 
make sure there is &quot;no daylight&quot; between the American government and 
the Israeli government.</P>
<p>And as the Israeli government has gotten tougher, so has the lobby.</P>
<p>&quot;The Jewish lobby has changed dramatically in the last 10 years. It is 
no longer a Jewish lobby per se, but a pro-Israeli lobby,&quot; explains Jean 
Abinader, managing director of the Arab-American Institute. &quot;The Kristols, 
Krauthammers and Safires have brought in their crowd—neoconservatives and Christian 
evangelicals.&quot;</P>
<p>What about the natural proclivity of Jews to be liberals? Liberals have yielded 
authority in the debate, Mr. Abinader says, due to feelings of fear and guilt 
over the horrors of the latest intifada: &quot;Who knows the security situation 
in Israel better, us or them?&quot; And, Mr. Abinader adds, American liberals 
have gotten no signals of moderation from the Palestinians. He’s right: I heard 
many of those sentiments expressed by the rabbi at a Kol Nidre service at a conservative 
synagogue on the Upper West Side.</P>
<p>The refusal of liberal American Jews to make an independent stand has left 
the American left helpless. American liberalism has always drawn strength from 
Jews. They are among the largest contributors to the Democratic Party; they have 
brought a special perspective to any number of social-justice questions, from 
the advancement of blacks and women to free speech. They fostered multiculturalism.</P>
<p>Those Jewish values would, you’d think, honor the Palestinians’ suffering and 
demand more evenhandedness of American policy. Or as the great Anthony Lewis writes 
in his introduction to <i>The Other Israel: Voices of Refusal and Dissent</i> 
(The New Press): &quot;[T]he issue is unambiguous: occupation. There can be peace 
only when Israel withdraws from the territories it conquered in 1967, leaving 
an uninterrupted West Bank as part of a viable Palestine.&quot;</P>
<p>But Mr. Lewis is retired from <i>The Times</i>, and there’s no political cover 
for his point of view. When Congress considered a bill on solidarity with Israel 
last spring, nearly 100 Congressmen argued against putting the legislation on 
the floor because it was so one-sided. But the bill did come to the floor, and 
only 21 of the 100 stuck their necks out to vote against it. Cynthia McKinney 
and Earl Hilliard were among them, and they’re now out of work.</P>
<p>Joined across the aisle by right-wing Republicans, Democratic Representative 
Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor, led the floor debate on that measure. The Holocaust 
continues to be the baseline reference for Jews when thinking about their relationship 
to the world, and the Palestinians. A couple of months ago, I got an e-mail from 
a friend of a friend in Israel about the latest bus-bombing. &quot;They’re going 
to kill us all,&quot; was the headline. (No matter that Israel has one of largest 
armies in the world, and that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis). 
Once, when I suggested to a liberal journalist friend that Americans had a right 
to discuss issues involving Jewish success in the American power structure—just 
as we examined the WASP culture of the establishment a generation ago—he said, 
&quot;Well, we know where that conversation ends up: in the ovens of Auschwitz.&quot;</P>
<p>So while liberal Jews often have private conversations about the Middle East 
in which they acknowledge the absence of leadership in the Israeli government 
and the desperation of the Palestinians, they generally do not wish this to become 
a public conversation with other American citizens. Even liberal Jews are afraid 
to test America’s dedication to fairness.</P>
<p>The effect of their silence is that the discussion of these issues is steered 
by the right, and the most intolerant views are bandied about in respectable circles 
without objection.</P>
<p>Last spring, Dick Armey—a leading conservative Zionist on national television—called 
for all Palestinians to leave the West Bank. This is a hateful position; it amounts 
to ethnic cleansing. But no one in Mr. Armey’s Zionist alliance condemned him 
for saying as much. The only criticism came from Arab-American quarters.</P>
<p>To judge from the rhetoric on the Web sites of supporters of Denise Majette, 
the candidate who defeated Ms. McKinney in the Democratic primary in Georgia, 
some of her backers also favor &quot;transfer&quot;—the expulsion of Arabs from 
the West Bank. No one tells them to take their money back.</P>
<p>It goes without saying that there is a vicious, anti-Semitic extremism on the 
Muslim side. The media are very sensitive to that. But with the collapse of any 
kind of liberal presence in this discussion, the American discourse has become 
tough and, at times, racist.</P>
<p>&quot;‘Discourse’ is the wrong word,&quot; says Mr. Abinader of the Arab-American 
Institute. &quot;Pro-Arab voices have no political power. There is not a dialogue. 
It’s like one hand clapping.&quot;</P>
<p>I’ve heard even Democratic Jews argue that Palestine is a fictional entity, 
that the people who lived in the area for generations have no true homeland, that 
they should be absorbed by Arab states. On campuses around the country, Zionists 
have succeeded in blocking Palestinians or their supporters from even speaking. 
Lately, following expressions of outrage from Zionists, the Queens Museum of Art 
removed a pamphlet from an art exhibit that asked viewers to &quot;hear a word 
on Palestine and perhaps to help us right a wrong.&quot; This spasm of intolerance 
was reported in the latest issue of the<i> Jewish Press</i>, which also included 
an insert attacking &quot;The Plague of Jewish-Arab Marriages.&quot; Racism, unremarked.</P>
<p>Where is the openness of the Jewish liberal tradition? Where is the respect?</P>
<p>It is a commonplace among peaceniks that the occupation has hurt Israel spiritually 
and practically. Well, it has hurt American Jews spiritually as well. The refusal 
to condemn the occupation on the basis of our hard-earned American values represents 
an abdication of moral authority.</P>
<p>Lately, <i>The Forward </i>reported an exceptional stand: Rabbi Paul Menitoff, 
a leader of the American Reform movement, called on the White House to send American 
troops to the Middle East and threaten both Israel and the Palestinians with sanctions 
if they don’t take positive steps toward peace.</P>
<p>Other Reform rabbis promptly attacked Mr. Menitoff for even suggesting that 
America has an independent power to bring to bear on the situation. Still, it 
would be nice to see the rabbi’s break as a sign of slippage. Jimmy Carter has 
lately made a forceful statement opposing the American government’s disdain for 
the Palestinians. An evangelical Christian group has distanced itself from right-wing 
evangelicals and called on George W. Bush to vigorously oppose &quot;the continued 
unlawful and degrading Israeli settlement movement.&quot;</P>
<p>Americans have had their own long struggle with human-rights questions, which 
can provide a helpful perspective on the Middle East. We have the right to see 
the region’s troubles as a cycle of violence in which both sides are inflamed 
and acting crazy—a cycle that we, as a superpower, have the ability to affect, 
that we do not have to be caught up in. And one day, before too long (a humble 
prediction), American peaceniks will take their seat at the policy table.
