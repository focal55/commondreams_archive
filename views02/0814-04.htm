<p> Even from my office in Ghana, it was clear that the recent U.S. decision to 
cancel this year's contribution to the United Nations Population Fund had nothing 
to do with China's abortion policies and everything to do with politics.
<p>But that didn't stop my blood from boiling. How could one man--albeit the U.S. 
president--so easily wager human lives and human hopes for short-term political 
gain? This decision does nothing about China's population policies. It doesn't 
help the women of the world who need access to prenatal care, family planning 
or other reproductive health services. This decision doesn't help those most vulnerable 
to HIV/AIDS. The only person helped by this decision is President Bush.
<p>People say the decision was motivated by a desire to placate the Christian 
right and those who oppose family planning in the United States. How can a decision 
that will leave women and children to die be called "Christian"? This decision 
will undermine and erode established and new reproductive health-care programs 
in 140 countries, including some of the poorest in the world.
<p> The only possible results are those the Bush administration claims it wants 
to prevent: unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and increased dangers for mothers 
and infants. At a time when the world has finally begun to grasp the devastating 
scale and pervasiveness of the AIDS pandemic, this decision could not be more 
irresponsible.
<p>Today, 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS; some 14,000 more become 
infected each day. Ninety-five percent of these people live in the developing 
world, and it's precisely in these locations that the United Nations Population 
Fund seeks to expand its programs.
<p>As an African living in Ghana, not a day goes by that I can forget about this 
disease, the toll it's taking on my people or how it is ravaging my continent. 
I am sad for the children of Africa--11 million of whom have been orphaned by 
AIDS. In high-prevalence countries in sub-Saharan Africa, at least one-third of 
all boys now age 15 will die of AIDS before their 35th birthday. The future of 
this continent is dying.
<p>The population fund offers a beacon of hope in this otherwise gloomy picture. 
It has strong relationships with governments and local organizations; the agency 
is known, respected and trusted by the people it helps. Its programs are also 
cost-effective.
<p>In less developed countries, a dollar or two is enough to buy some medicine, 
pay for a medical visit or supply contraceptives for three months or more. Sometimes 
it's enough to save a life. Of course, the $34 million being withheld by the United 
States may seem insignificant to a nation that spends $100 billion a year on fast 
food. Regrettably, the decision also marks another step backward for the U.S. 
on international family planning overall.
<p>Nearly a decade ago, I chaired the main committee at the International Conference 
on Population and Development in Cairo, where leaders of the world promised to 
help make universal access to family planning and other reproductive health services 
a reality for all people.
<p>The international community is still little more than halfway toward the spending 
goals set for 2000 at that conference. Only four countries--the Netherlands, Denmark, 
Sweden and Norway--have met or achieved their "fair share" of the target funding. 
The United States trails by far.
<p>There is word that the U.S. Senate is working on language for next year's budget 
that will not only restore funding to the population fund but increase it to $50 
million. This would be the right thing to do. I hope Congress and the American 
people will indeed restore funding and make clear to the president how unacceptable 
his decision is.</p>

HIV/AIDS and on the board of directors of Population Action International.</i></p>
