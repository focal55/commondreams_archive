<p>Dear Gabriel, 
<p> Like the rest of the family I've hassled you quite a bit over the years for 
just pulling up stakes and moving to Syria, of all places. (Was Long Island that 
bad?) But in light of the election results here last week I wonder, my dear older 
brother, if you might have a spare room or two for my family and me. Damascus 
suddenly looks like a good place to spend the next couple of years of this Republican 
shogunate, although I wouldn't be surprised if your mayor, too, is a Republican, 
if your muezzin is a Republican, if your cats meow Republican. They're everywhere, 
those Grand Old Party boomers. Word has it the GOP expects to sweep the first 
elections in Baghdad after the winter's war, then set its sights on a few of those 
oily Asian republics and boldly go where no pipeline has gone before. 
<p> I'm exaggerating. Even the Democrats would kill for those pipelines, but you 
get the idea. The country is in the mood for monochromatic simplicities like never 
since the days when Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge posed as presidents, Congress 
was somnolent, and William Howard Taft, that rotund mediocrity, was chief justice 
of the very conservative supreme court he'd packed a few years earlier, when he 
was president. Then as now the country had gone through a bit of a trauma -- not 
World War I, which Americans rather enjoyed as they do most wars, but a tide of 
anti-corporate populism that scared Wall Street stiff. The Harding-Coolidge years 
lubed up Wall Street again and stiffed everybody else, with the inevitable consequence 
of 1929. We're in for a repeat racket. 
<p> You left the country just as the purring 1990s got under way, but think of 
them as the 1920s uncorked and unclothed, as the 1980s unbound. No prohibitions 
to worry about, no more Soviet Union to worry about, not much of anything to worry 
about, really. For a while it even seemed as if we had deficits and the business 
cycle licked. With the whole nation pledging allegiance to the markets, politics 
became so irrelevant, Democrats and Republicans so interchangeable, that the whole 
country settled into governance by toss-up. Then came the attacks. Wall Street 
was literally doused in the ashes of Sept. 11, and for a while the sweat in corporate 
board rooms smelled of that 1929 vintage. Acridly fruity. The economy was tanking 
anyway, like the Bush presidency, and it looked as if having an ellipsis for a 
president might prove costly. 
<p> But Republican policy is the art of deferral. The stage managers of the Bush 
presidency realized immediately that the trauma this time was at once far more 
visceral and far less severe than, say, a real war or a depression. Like any act 
of terrorism in an essentially stable society the attacks were nothing more than 
a spectacularly deadly freak. They couldn't change the lives of most Americans 
one whit, and didn't. The change was all Bush's. He turned the attacks into his 
own personal blessing, milking them for their traumatic value as his only means 
of making himself indispensable and his business-scripted repression necessary. 
Plagiarizing from the Cold War play book, he manufactured the kind of fears and 
enmities that naturally make Americans more conservative. He succeeded so well 
that the likes of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, two basement-variety rogues, 
now seem more threatening to the United States than Stalin, Kruschev and their 
ICBMs ever did. (And they said the age of irony was dead). Just as Harding called 
the American dream "a damn good phrase with which to carry an election," Bush 
has made perpetual war with one axis or another a damn good plan with which to 
carry many elections. Fear and loathing have never been so politically expedient. 
<p> The administration can now resume making America safer for shareholders and 
the world safer for America, all the while paying for the new imperium with Reagan-style 
debt and that unfailing electoral bribe, the tax cut. Because most of those who 
do vote are older, richer and exclusively concerned with defying taxes (if not 
death), the Republican gift has been to turn their America into a banana republic, 
the kind of place where they don't have to pay taxes, but legally. As a result 
our social services are beginning to look like those of a banana republic, too 
(inmates get better health care than about 50 million Americans, feedlots are 
better subsidized than many schools). 
<p> You'd think the Democrats would have a thing or two to say about this splendid 
little heist. But the opposition is part of the problem. It doesn't exist. I haven't 
been a Democrat since Adlai Stevenson left the building (and I wasn't even born 
when Adlai Stevenson was around), but I'm sure I'm only one in many millions who 
look at Democrats and despair of their intellectual vapidity, their cluelessness 
in the face of so many opportunities to live up to their name. They've instead 
stood by like spectators at their own beheading. The wonder is that despite everything 
the nation is still split down the middle between the two parties, which only 
confirms the extent to which Republicans are winning by default. The show is so 
easily the Democrats' to steal, if they could muster a spine or two out of their 
skeletal ideas. But should I make my way out to you, dear Gabriel, I wouldn't 
be surprised if the road to Damascus was full of Democrats falling off their donkeys. 
I would be surprised if any of them could manage a revelation or two to help them 
make their way back to where they belong. Chances are they'd get right back on 
their donkeys and confuse them with elephants. 
<p> Give my love to Faridah and your three boys. But on second thought, don't 
leave the porch light on for us. The best of America was hewed in dissent, and 
I have too much faith in this place to turn off my own porch light.
