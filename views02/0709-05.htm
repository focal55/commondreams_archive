<p>The face of AIDS is female.
<P> Hers is not the portrait the American public wants to see. It is more comfortable 
for us to conclude that AIDS is a disease that affects only them. That is, people 
who are gay or in the grip of drugs, out there at a distance that is safe enough 
from the moral middle class.
<P> The international conference on AIDS being held this week in Barcelona bares 
the truth. Women - heterosexual women in sanctioned relationships - are the world's 
chief victims of AIDS.
<P> They are not yet a majority of those who suffer from AIDS but they will be, 
and soon. Some 44 percent of those who are HIV-positive are now women, according 
to a United Nations report prepared for the conference. If the future is with 
the young, as the politicians are so fond of saying, for girls it is grim.
<P> Worldwide, average HIV infection rates among teenage girls are more than five 
times higher than those for teenage boys, according to the UN. Among people now 
in their 20s, infection rates are three times higher among women than among men. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, epicenter of the epidemic, women already are a majority 
of those infected.
<P> Are they uninformed? Immoral? Incapable of just saying no?
<P> They are merely second-class citizens. "Gender inequalities," the United Nations 
has concluded, "are a major, driving force behind the AIDS epidemic."
<P> Biased and brutal cultures, not bad behavior, are killing women and girls. 
Many teenage girls in the developing world are forced into early marriage. Most 
are forced to wed older men who've already had many partners. Many are beaten. 
Widows, in some societies, are the property of the dead husband's brother.
<P> Social inequality turns out to be a most effective incubator of unsafe sex.
<P> "Women don't have any leverage to negotiate protection," said Dr. Geeta Rao 
Gupta, president of the International Center for Research on Women, in an interview 
from Barcelona. "If you are economically dependent on your husband or his family, 
how can you insist that he wear a condom? How do you get him to stop beating you?"
<P> Abstinence-only seems not to be an option.
<P> Yet abstinence is the official position the United States now takes in international 
health forums when the subject is adolescent sex. Mostly, the Bush administration 
has lost that argument to the majority of nations who find it does not fit the 
facts. A third of pregnant teenagers at a prenatal clinic in Cape Town, for example, 
told researchers that their first intercourse was forced. Four of 10 unmarried 
Kenyan teenagers said they'd received money, gifts or some other favor for sex.
<P> The Bush administration now offers increased aid to prevent the transmission 
of the AIDS virus from pregnant mothers to their babies. This route of infection 
is easily and cheaply prevented through drugs. Healthy babies are beautiful to 
behold, easy to love and perfect for political embrace.
<P> And what about mother?
<P> At the same time it nobly tries to prevent infection in babies, the administration 
is poised to eliminate funding for the UN population fund, based on unfounded 
charges by some anti-abortion activists that the UN is complicit in China's forced 
abortion policy. The population agency provides AIDS-prevention counseling in 
142 countries. It is often the only source of information in a rural village. 
It offers contraception and prenatal care.
<P> So the sum of the two American policies is this: A woman might well have AIDS, 
but no access to birth control to prevent a pregnancy that could result in a baby 
Americans would then gladly treat to prevent AIDS.
<P> Of course, the United States cannot by itself lift up the world's women from 
life-threatening subservience. But neither should it help push them back. This 
is a global campaign against death itself. Now we know death really does discriminate.
<P> Governments - all governments - must finally admit that by social custom and 
social policy, they are killing women. Early in this crisis, we learned AIDS is 
both fatal and preventable. So is sexism.
