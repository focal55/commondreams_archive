<p>There is scarcely a discussion of climate change on the radio or television 
that does not involve a "climate skeptic" - someone who believes there is no problem. 
This would be unexceptionable if the media always promoted dissent: if, for example, 
someone was brought in to attack capitalism every time the economy was discussed. 
But the coverage the anti-environmentalists receive suggests that the dissent 
that reinforces an underlying orthodoxy is welcome while that which challenges 
it is not. Whatever the explanation may be, the airtime their views receive is 
out of all proportion to the scientific support they muster. 
<P>But let us, for a moment, assume that they are right. Let us imagine that climate 
change does not exist, that pollution does no damage to ecosystems or human health, 
that fisheries are not collapsing, freshwater reserves are not drying up, topsoil 
is not eroding, and forests and coral reefs are not disappearing. Let us pretend 
there is no conflict between two of the avowed goals of the current earth summit: 
relieving poverty in the poor nations while enhancing economic growth in the rich 
ones. Let us pretend that there is no competition for resources between rich and 
poor. Let us accept, in other words, the myths of neoliberalism. 
<P>This is the position taken by the farmer and philosopher Simon Fairlie in his 
new pamphlet, The Prospect of Cornutopia. He envisages the future that most of 
the rich world's governments, economists and media foresee. In this vision, economic 
growth proceeds at some 3% a year, without threatening the earth's capacity to 
support its population. By 2100, if this rate is sustained, we will be 18 times 
richer than we are today. 
<P>Fairlie asks the question that so many economists have ducked. When we possess 
this fabulous wealth, how will we spend it? "A fraction of this amount," he notes, 
"will provide all of us with the one car per two people which appears to be the 
saturation rate ... What next? Will everyone be jetting around the world on a 
weekly basis from airports in every town? Will each home have 10 rooms and a swimming 
pool and, if so, where are we going to build them?" Will we then inhabit the terrestrial 
heaven that the advocates of endless growth have promised us? 
<P>I hardly dare to mention this for fear of being accused of romanticizing poverty 
or somehow conspiring to keep people in the picturesque state to which I would 
never submit myself. But it is impossible not to notice that, in some of the poorest 
parts of the world, most people, most of the time, appear to be happier than we 
are. In southern Ethiopia, for example, the poorest half of the poorest nation 
on earth, the streets and fields crackle with laughter. In homes constructed from 
packing cases and palm leaves, people engage more freely, smile more often, express 
more affection than we do behind our double glazing, surrounded by remote controls. 
<P>This is not to suggest that poverty causes happiness. In southern Ethiopia 
people desperately want better healthcare, better education, better housing and 
sanitation, not to mention smart clothes, motorbikes, refrigerators and radios. 
But while poverty does not cause happiness, there appears to be some evidence 
that wealth causes misery. Since 1950, 25-year-olds in Britain have become 10 
times more likely to be affected by depression. And it is surely fair to say that 
most of us suffer from subclinical neuroses, anxiety or a profound discomfort 
with ourselves. 
<P>Perhaps one of the reasons why people in Ethiopia appear to be happier than 
we are is that they have less to lose by letting other people into their lives. 
The more wealth we possess, the more isolated we become. We must defend it, and 
ourselves, against the intrusions of other people. 
<P>An increase in wealth is always either preceded or followed by an increase 
in property rights. Over the past 20 years, for example, wealthy people have laid 
claim to human genes, public archives, town squares and village greens, playing 
fields, beaches, even clouds and landing spaces on the moon. Having enhanced their 
wealth, they retreat to gated communities, hire guards and install CCTV and movement 
sensors. 
<P>The rich lock themselves in and lock everyone else out. So many fences rise 
to exclude us that after a while we are no longer shut out but shut in. And if 
we try to cross those barriers we pay dearly, for the increasing freedom of capital 
has been accompanied by unprecedented rates of imprisonment. For both the secluded 
and the excluded, the fruits of economic growth become a substitute for human 
interaction: we prefer watching TV than talking to our neighbors.
<P>Plenty of evidence suggests that as we become richer, we become less content 
with ourselves. It is incorrect to say that necessity is the mother of invention. 
In the rich world, invention is the mother of necessity. When people already possess 
all the goods and services they need, growth can be stimulated only by discovering 
new needs. Advertising creates gaps in our lives in order to fill them. We buy 
the products, but the gaps remain. 
<P>Already, in the rich nations, the beneficiaries of development spend much of 
their money on escaping from it: it costs a fortune to live in a place that does 
not assault your eyes and ears with ugliness. To absorb our increasing wealth 
we must keep building. Our new cars need new roads, our new goods and services 
must come from new shops and warehouses and offices. One day there may be nowhere 
left in which we can shut the noise out of our heads. 
<P>Wealth also appears to reduce our capacity to act. Our reliance upon technology 
supplants our reliance upon ourselves and other people. As George Orwell suggested, 
"the logical end of mechanical progress is to reduce the human being to something 
resembling a brain in a bottle". 
<P>In other words, as Simon Fairlie argues, the rich world is approaching the 
point at which "satiation turns into deprivation". Even if we were to forget the 
damage our growing economies inflict upon the environment, even if we were to 
ignore the conflict between our greed and the fulfillment of other people's needs, 
we should be able to see that economic growth in nations that are rich enough 
already is a disaster. 
<P>Environmentalists have been fudging this issue for far too long. We have been 
demanding an accommodation between the irreconcilable objectives of ever-increasing 
wealth and environmental protection, an accommodation we call "sustainable development". 
<P>We know that the world is already rich enough to meet all real human needs, 
but that this wealth is not trickling down from rich to poor. We know that while 
there is a desperate need for redistribution, further growth in the rich world 
is likely to make everyone more miserable. We know that wealth has been romanticized. 
Yet we are afraid to ask for what we really want. Unless we are brave enough to 
confront the notion that growth is good, the world will shop until it drops.
