<p>George W. Bush, fresh off a brush clearing operation at his Crawford ranch, 
snubbed the Earth Summit in Johannesburg for a trip to Oregon, where he vowed 
to fight future forest fires by taking a chainsaw to the nation's forests and 
the environmental laws that protect them. 
<p>In the name of fire prevention, Bush wants to allow the timber industry to 
log off more than 2.5 million acres of federal forest over the next ten years. 
He wants it done quickly and without any interference from pesky statutes such 
as the Endangered Species Act. Bush called his plan "the Healthy Forests Initiative." 
But it's nothing more than a giveaway to big timber, that comes at a high price 
to the taxpayer and forest ecosystems. 
<p>Bush's stump speech was a craven bit of political opportunism, rivaled, perhaps, 
only by Bush's call to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling 
as a way to help heal the nation after the attacks of September 11. That plan 
sputtered around for awhile, but didn't go anywhere. But count on it: this one 
will. 
<p>Bush is exploiting a primal fear of fire that almost overwhelms the crippling 
anxiety about terrorists. In a one of the great masterstrokes of PR, Americans 
have been conditioned for the past 60 years that forest fires are bad...bad for 
forests. It's no accident that Smokey the Bear is the most popular icon in the 
history of advertising, far outdistancing Tony the Tiger or Capt. Crunch. 
<p>But the forests of North America were born out of fires, not destroyed by them. 
After Native Americans settled across the continent following the Wisconsin glaciation, 
fires became an even more regular event, reshaping the ecology of the Ponderosa 
pine and spruce forests of the Interior West and the mighty Douglas-fir forests 
of the Pacific Coast. 
<p>Forest fires became stigmatized only when forests began to be viewed as a commercial 
resource rather than an obstacle to settlement. Fire suppression became an obsession 
only after the big timber giants laid claim to the vast forests of the Pacific 
Northwest. Companies like Weyerhaeuser and Georgia-Pacific were loath to see their 
holdings go up in flames, so they arm-twisted Congress into pour millions of dollars 
into Forest Service fire-fighting programs. The Forest Service was only too happy 
to oblige because fire suppression was a sure way to pad their budget: along with 
the lobbying might of the timber companies they could literally scare Congress 
into handing over a blank check. [For an excellent history of the political economy 
of forest fires I highly recommend Stephen Pyne's, Fire in America.] 
<p>In effect, the Forest Service fire suppression programs (and similar operations 
by state and local governments) have acted as little more than federally-funded 
fire insurance policies for the big timber companies, an ongoing corporate bailout 
that has totaled tens of billions of dollars and shows no sign of slowing down. 
There's an old saying that the Forest Service fights fires by throwing money at 
them. And the more money it spends, the more money it gets from Congress. 
<p>"The Forest Service budgetary process rewards forest managers for losing money 
on environmentally destructive timber sales and penalizes them for making money 
or doing environmentally beneficial activities," says Randal O'Toole, a forest 
economist at the Thoreau Institute in Bandon, Oregon. "Until those incentives 
are changed, giving the Forest Service more power to sell or thin trees without 
environmental oversight will only create more problems than it solves." 
<p>Where did all the money go? It largely went to amass a fire-fighting infrastructure 
that rivals the National Guard: helicopters, tankers, satellites, airplanes and 
a legion of young men and women who are thrust, often carelessly, onto the firelines. 
Hundreds of fire fighters have perished, often senselessly. For a chilling historical 
account of how inept Forest Service fire bureaucrats put young firefighters in 
harms way read Norman Maclean's (author of A River Runs Through It) last book, 
Young Men and Fire. In this book, Maclean describes how incompetence and hubris 
by bureaucrats led to the deaths of 13 firefighters outside Seeley Lake, Montana 
in the great fire of 1949. More recently, mismanagement has led to firefighters 
being needlessly killed in Washington and Colorado. 
<p>Since the 1920s, the Forest Service fire-fighting establishment has been under 
orders to attack forest fires within 12 hours of the time when the fires were 
first sighted. For decades, there's been a zero tolerance policy toward wildfires. 
Even now, after forest ecologists have proved that most forests not only tolerate 
but need fire, the agency tries to suppress 99.7 percent of all wildfires. This 
industry-driven approach has come at a terrible economic and ecological price. 
<p>With regular fires largely excluded from the forests and grasslands, thickets 
of dry timber, small sickly trees and brush began to build up. This is called 
fuel loading. These thickets began a breeding ground for insects and diseases 
that ravaged healthy forest stands. The regular, low-intensity fires that have 
swept through the forests for millennia have now been replaced by catastrophic 
blazes that roar with a fury that is without historical or ecological precedent. 
<p>Even so the solution to the fuels problem is burning, not logging. The Bush 
plan is the environmental equivalent of looting a bombed out city and raping the 
survivors. The last thing a burned over forest needs is an assault by chainsaws, 
logging roads and skid trails, to haul out the only living trees in a scorched 
landscape. The evidence has been in for decades. The proof can be found at Mt. 
St. Helens and Yellowstone Park: Unlogged burned forests recover quickly, feeding 
off the nutrients left behind dead trees and shrubs. On the other hand, logged 
over burned forests rarely recover, but persists as kind of biological deserts, 
prone to mudslides, difficult to revegetate and abandoned by salmon and deep forest 
birds, such as the spotted owl, goshawk and marbled murrelet. They exist as desolate 
islands inside the greater ecosystem. 
<p>Even worse, such a plan only encourages future arsonists. The easiest way to 
clearcut an ancient forest is to set fire to it first. Take a look at the major 
fire of the west this summer: the big blazes in Arizona and Colorado were set 
by Forest Service employees and seasonal fire-fighters, another big fire in California 
was started by a marijuana suppression operation, fires in Oregon, Washington 
and Montana have been started by humans. 
<p>In Oregon more than 45,000 acres of prime ancient forest in the Siskiyou Mountains 
was torched by the Forest Service's firefighting crews to start a backfire in 
order to "save" a town that wasn't threatened to begin with. The fires were ignited 
by shooting ping-pong balls filled with napalm into the forest of giant Douglas-firs. 
By one estimate, more than a third of the acres burned this summer were ignited 
by the Forest Service as backfires. That's good news for the timber industry since 
they get to log nearly all those acres for next to nothing. 
<p>Far from acting as a curative, a century of unrestrained logging has vastly 
increased the intensity and frequency of wildfires, particularly in the West. 
The Bush plan promises only more of the same at an accelerated and uninhibited 
pace. When combined with global warming, persistent droughts, and invasions by 
alien insects species (such as the Asian-long-horned beetle) and diseases, the 
future for American forests looks very bleak indeed. 
<p>Predictably, the Bush scheme was met with howls of protest from the big environmental 
groups. This is part of Bush's irresponsible anti-environmental Agenda," said 
Bill Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society. "The truth is that waiving 
environmental laws will not protect homes and lives from wildfire." 
<p>But they only have themselves to blame. They helped lay the political groundwork 
for the Bush plan long ago. And now the Administration, and its backers in Big 
Timber, have seized the day and put the environmentalists on the run. 
<p>The environmentalists have connived with the logging-to-prevent-fires scam 
for political reasons. First came a deal to jettison a federal court injunction 
against logging in the Montana's Bitterroot National Forest designed to appease 
Senator Max Baucus, friend of Robert Redford and a ranking Democrat. More than 
14,000 acres of prime forest inside formerly protected roadless areas are now 
being clearcut. Then last month came a similar deal brokered by Senate Majority 
Leader Tom Daschle with the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society that allows 
the timber industry to begin logging the Black Hills, sacred land of the Sioux, 
totally unfettered by any environmental constraints. 
<p>Grassroots greens warned that such willy-nilly dealmaking with Democrats would 
soon become a model for a national legislation backed by Bush and Republican legislators 
that would dramatically escalate logging on all national forests and exempt the 
clearcuts from compliance with environmental laws. We've now reached that point. 
<p>And there's no sign the big greens have learned their lesson. 
<p>The latest proposal comes courtesy of the Oregon Natural Resources Council 
and the Sierra Club. It's rather timidly called the "Environmentalist New Vision." 
There's nothing new about the plan, except that it is being endorsed by a claque 
of politically intimidated green groups instead of Boise-Cascade. It calls for 
thinning ( i.e., logging) operations near homes in the forest/suburb interface. 
This is a pathetic and dangerous approach that sends two wrong messages in one 
package: that thinning reduces fire risk and that it's okay to build houses in 
forested environments. 
<p>In fact, there's no evidence that thinning will reduce fires in these situations 
and it may provide a false sense of security when there are other measures that 
are more effective and less damaging to the environment. 
<p>"Forest Service fire researcher Jack Cohen has found that homes and other structures 
will be safe from fire if their roof and landscaping within 150 feet of the structures 
are fireproofed," says O'Toole. "A Forest Service report says there are 1.9 million 
high-risk acres in the wildland-urban interface, of which 1.5 million are private. 
Treating these acres, not the 210 million federal acres, will protect homes. Firebreaks 
along federal land boundaries, not treatments of lands within those boundaries, 
will protect other private property. Once private lands are protected, the Forest 
Service can let most fires on federal lands burn." 
<p>As it stands, the Sierra Club's scheme will only result in more logging, more 
subdivisions in wildlands and, predictably, more fires. Any environmental outfit 
with a conscience would call for an immediate thinning of subdivisions on urban/wildland 
interface, not forests. Don't hold your breath. Too many big-time contributors 
to environmental groups own huge houses inside burn-prone forests in places Black 
Butte Ranch, Oregon, Flagstaff, Arizona and Vail, Colorado. 
<p>Of course, there's still resistance to these schemes. When Bush arrived in 
Portland to make official his handout to big timber, he was greeted by nearly 
a thousand protesters. On the streets of the Rose City, Earth First!ers and anti-war 
activists shouted down Bush and his plans for war on Iraq and the environment. 
The riot police soon arrived in their Darth Vader gear. The demonstrators, old 
and young alike, were beaten, gassed, and shot at with plastic bullets. They even 
pepper sprayed children. Dozens were arrested; others were bloodied by bullets 
and nightsticks. 
<p>This is a portent of things to come. When the laws have been suspended, the 
only option to protect forests will be direct action: bodies barricaded against 
bulldozers, young women suspended in trees, impromptu encampments in the deep 
snows of the Cascades and Rockies. 
<p>Not long ago, the occupation of cutting down the big trees ranked as one of 
the most dangerous around. Now, thanks to the connivance of Bush, Daschle and 
the big enviro groups, the job of protecting them will be fraught with even more 
peril. 
<p>Those brave young forest defenders, forced into the woods as a thin green line 
against the chainsaws, should send their bail requests to the Sierra Club and 
their medical bills to the Wilderness Society. They can afford it.
