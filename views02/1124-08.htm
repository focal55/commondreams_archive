<p> Saturday, the FBI announced it was investigating
whether the Saudi government funded students who
assisted two of the 9/11 hijackers. Only this summer,
a top Pentagon official told me there was no
connection between the Saudi government and the
September 11th attacks. Quite understandably that was
all he could say in light of the Administration's
policy. What is disturbing, if not surprising, is that
the Administration stubbornly continues to downplay
the Saudi government's complicity and perhaps direct involvement in al Qaeda's funding, so as not to distract from its war plans for Iraq. 
<p>It would behoove Americans to recall that in 1945
president Franklin Roosevelt and King Abdul-Aziz Ibn
Saud agreed that the U.S. would protect Saudi Arabia
from foreign threats and in return would gain
preferred access to Saudi oil. Implied in this deal,
was that the U.S. would overlook the autocratic nature
of the Saudi government, as it was a vital buffer
against communist incursion. 
<p>Much has changed since 1945, but this bargain
has endured because it remains highly profitable for
leaders on both sides--but at what cost?
Unfortunately, 9/11 and other previous al Qaeda
attacks are probably only the beginning of the cost to
the U.S. But the Saudi government may also eventually
pay, as the clash on November 16th and November 17th
between Saudi security forces and young disciples of
bin Laden hinted.   
<p>Obviously the Bush administration is not willing to
sever ties to Saudi Arabia, to pull out our troops,
close our bases, and pay $5 dollars/gallon or more at
the gas pump. But, if the Administration and Congress
are going to be serious about eliminating al Qaeda,
then they must bring enormous pressure to bear on the
Saudi government to completely cooperate in
apprehending and bringing to justice private citizens
or officials that have aided al Qaeda. No doubt this
will be tricky, as the money has probably come from
the highest levels. However, to ignore this, as the Administration would like, is a mistake we cannot
afford to make.   
<p>Last month the Washington Post reported that
U.S. intelligence named about a dozen of al Qaeda's
Saudi financiers and that the Treasury Department is
sending officials to Europe to gain cooperation in
freezing their assets. These private Saudi citizens
have apparently been funding al Qaeda all along and
enjoy the protection of the government. This is no
secret and the Administration knows it, but has so far
been unwilling to take the drastic action necessary to
cut terrorist funding.
<p>Two months ago, the Wall Street Journal cited the
example of an alleged al Qaeda logistics chief and
Saudi businessman who was recently detained by Saudi
police, after he was named in a private lawsuit
brought by victims of the World Trade Center attacks.
If we knew about him, why didn't we present him with a
one-way ticket from Prince Sultan Air Base to
Guantánamo Bay?  
<p>The truth is, we know very well where the money is
coming from, even though American officials insist
it's difficult to track the many cash transactions
involved. It is difficult, but it's significantly
harder when you're not even willing to try.
