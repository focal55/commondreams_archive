<p>Palestinian Authority President Yasir Arafat stunned the world yesterday by 
demanding that the United States hold democratic elections for a new Chief 
Executive before it attempts to continue in its role as broker between 
Israel and Palestine.

<p>"Mr. Bush is tainted by his association with Jim-Crow-style selective 
disenfranchisement and executive strong-arm tactics in a southeastern 
province controlled by his brother," said Mr. Arafat, who was elected with 
87% of the vote in 1996 elections in the West Bank and Gaza, declared to be 
free and fair by international observers, including former U.S. president 
Jimmy Carter. "Our count shows that he would have lost the election if his 
associates hadn't deprived so many thousands of African-Americans, an 
oppressed minority, of the right to vote. He is not the man to bring peace 
to the Middle East."

<p>Hugo Chavez, elected president of Venezuela with 62% of the popular vote, 
concurred with Mr. Arafat. Chavez has long been a victim of Bush's 
anti-democratic attitude, as the Bush administration funneled hundreds of 
thousands of dollars through the "National Endowment for Democracy" to 
anti-Chavez forces and reportedly gave the go-ahead for an attempted 
military coup by those forces. "After it was over and I was back in power," 
said Chavez, "his administration actually told me 'legitimacy is not 
conferred by a majority vote.' Unless, of course, it's a majority of the 
Supreme Court. I respect the local traditions, however quaint, of the 
United States, but he hardly sets the best example for the Middle East, 
does he? Why don't we get back to that idea of an international conference 
to settle the question of Palestine?"

<p>Bush was not without his supporters, however. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon, elected head of a country that legally discriminates among its 
citizens on the basis of religious belief, forbids political candidates 
from advocating an end to that discrimination, and disenfranchises an 
entire people through military occupation, dismissed the call as "absurd."

<p>Hamid Karzai, recently "elected" head of Afghanistan by a grand council, or 
"loya jirga," in which a foreign body, controlled by the United States, 
selected delegates; unelected warlords who had ravaged the country were 
permitted to control the meeting and to threaten delegates who refused to 
vote their way; and the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay 
Khalilzad, refused to allow at least two other candidates to stand for 
election, added his support for Mr. Bush in his hour of need. Said Karzai, 
"In Afghanistan, we have the loya jirga. In the United States, you have 
your own process -- as we understand, it's traditional over there for 
corporations to play a large part in electing officials and writing 
legislation. We're very interested in looking into that kind of system 
ourselves."

<p>Vojislav Kostunica, chosen head of Yugoslavia in an election where the 
United States spent an estimated $25 million to influence the results, was 
also keen to rush to Bush's defense, indicating that he saw no procedural 
problems with the 2000 elections.

<p>And Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, long derided for his claim that "Asian 
culture" is at odds with universal human rights, added, "The elections are 
strictly an internal matter, and should have no bearing on the status of 
the United States as a broker. The Palestinians' high-handedness is a 
serious threat to national independence."

<p>In a surprise move, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, long an ally of the 
United States, supported Arafat's call, saying, "While we're at it, let's 
take another look at our agreement on American independence. George 
Washington was not only unelected, he did rather associate with terrorists. 
Benedict Arnold would have been a much more suitable partner for peace, 
n'est ce pas?"

<p>Arafat, busy working on a plan to find a new Israeli leader not tainted 
with the massacre of hundreds of innocents in Sabra and Shatila to 
negotiate with, could not be reached for further comment.
