<p>Had he been born in the old Soviet Union, Philip Berrigan would have vanished into the gulag or a psychiatric hospital.
<P></P>
He had every credential for the dissident's role: a burning faith in his own beliefs verging at times on zealotry, buttressed by a deep humanity and an immense courage that enabled him to defy governments and challenge the "don't-rock-the-boat" mindset of conventional public opinion.
<P></P>
Providence, however, decided that Berrigan would be a dissident in what he sometimes called "the American Empire." 
<P></P>
As a young man, he was a promising athlete who played semi-professional baseball before deciding to go north to attend St. Michael's College in Toronto for a short time before being drafted.
<P></P>
In 1943, he went off to fight in the U.S. Army infantry, where he performed competently enough to earn a battlefield commission as a second lieutenant. 
<P></P>
But within a decade of war's end, the fighting soldier &#8212; in his words "a highly skilled young killer, I thought then that's what patriots did" &#8212; had become a man totally committed to peace.
<P></P>
Ordained a Catholic priest in 1955, he went on to become a passionate and at times violent anti-war activist, first against the conflict in Vietnam and then against nuclear weapons. 
<P></P>
On several occasions, his journey would take him to prison.
<P></P>
Along the way, he fell in love with Elizabeth McAlister, a nun with whom he exchanged marriage vows in letters smuggled to and from his cell.
<P></P>
When they officially married in 1973, they were both excommunicated.
<P></P>
Wryly, he would describe his condition as "a Catholic trying to be a Christian."
<P></P>
For the last 30 years of his life, Berrigan's base was Jonah House, a communal home for pacifists the couple set up in Baltimore. 
<P></P>
There, he earned a modest living from writing, housepainting and lecturing about the causes to which he'd devoted himself. 
<P></P>
Berrigan's convictions were fueled by the evils of segregation, which he had first witnessed in the treatment of black soldiers on the troop ship to Europe. 
<P></P>
When he decided to become a priest, he joined the Josephite order, which is devoted to helping African Americans.
<P></P>
A seven-year stint in New Orleans, teaching theology at an all-black parish school, only increased his determination to root out "the poisonous tree" of racism. 
<P></P>
By the late 1960s, Vietnam was casting an ever-darker shadow and Berrigan's views were sealed: Racism and war were strangling all that was good in America. 
<P></P>
"Is it possible for us," he asked, "to be vicious, brutal and violent at home, and to be fair, judicious, beneficent and idealistic abroad?" 
<P></P>
The priest became so troublesome that the Josephites ordered him to stop speaking out against injustice. 
<P></P>
He refused, was transferred to parishes in New York state and then Baltimore &#8212; and changed his opposition from words to deeds. 
<P></P>
His first act of protest came on Oct. 17, 1967, when he and three friends entered a public office in Baltimore and spattered Vietnam draft-board documents with a liquid made in part from their blood. 
<P></P>
That offense ultimately earned him a six-year jail term. 
<P></P>
Exactly seven months later &#8212; on May 17, 1968 &#8212; came the incident that turned Berrigan and his brother Daniel into national figures, when they and seven other activists set fire to hundreds of draft cards at Catonsville, Md., using a homemade napalm of gasoline mixed with soap. 
<P></P>
The trial of the "Catonsville Nine" resulted in a 3&nbsp;1/2-year jail term, which Berrigan was to serve concurrently with the Baltimore sentence.
<P></P>
The nine did not meekly go to prison, arguing that punishment for an action that had been right was itself wrong. Within a few days, Philip Berrigan was tracked down and captured.
<P></P>
America being America, he and Daniel, a priest who'd joined the Jesuit order in 1952, became celebrities, appearing on the cover of <i>Time </i>magazine while the glitziest writers queued up to profile them.
<P></P>
But, America also being a country less tolerant of dissent than its carefully burnished image would indicate, the Berrigans were widely vilified as communists and traitors. 
<P></P>
Philip Berrigan was undeterred. In 1980, he was a co-founder of the Plowshares movement against nuclear weapons and the U.S.-Soviet arms race. 
<P></P>
The organization signaled its arrival by breaking into a General Electric factory near Philadelphia. 
<P></P>
His protests continued until the very end of his life. In 1999, he and three other activists broke into a U.S. National Guard air base near Baltimore to protest the use of depleted uranium, widely suspected of causing cancer, to strengthen anti-armor shells. He received a jail term that kept him behind bars until December, 2001. 
<P></P>
"I'm going to fight all the way, and hopefully die with my boots on," he said. And on Dec. 6, at age 79, that's just what he did.
<P></P>
America is again on the brink of launching a war, this time against Iraq. In a final statement released to his friends and supporters a few days before his death, Berrigan warned of these "hair-trigger times, with well-manicured barbarians at the wheel and our nuclear strike force armed and ready."
