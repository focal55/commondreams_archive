<p>Last week, the Arab American Institute (AAI) and Americans for Peace Now (APN) 
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1122-01.htm">released a joint 
public opinion poll</a> of Jewish and Arab Americans' attitudes toward Israeli-Palestinian 
peace. 
<p>Roughly 87 percent of Jewish Americans and 97 percent of Arab Americans 
surveyed agreed that Israelis and Palestinians alike have the right to live 
in secure and independent states.  When polled about the likely details of 
such a two-state solution, including the evacuation of most Israeli 
settlements from the West Bank and Gaza, implementation of a right of return 
for Palestinian refugees to the new Palestinian state, and sharing Jerusalem 
as the capital of both states, support remained high with 52 percent of 
Jewish Americans and 79 percent of Arab Americans favoring such a 
compromise.

<p>In addition to revealing that our two communities are more moderate and less 
fanatic on Middle East-related issues than people are often led to believe, 
the survey results also send a clear message to our decision-makers that 
Jewish and Arab Americans want to see the United States follow policies that 
will encourage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process rather than detract 
from it.  The results also raise some key questions that must be addressed 
both among and between the Jewish and Arab communities in this country.

<p>First, if Jewish Americans overwhelmingly support the establishment of a 
Palestinian state and a majority of them say they would support the terms of 
a just and lasting peace, then why is the Jewish American establishment 
pursuing an anti-peace agenda?  For the past two years, as Palestinians have 
fought for their right to live in an independent state free of a foreign 
military occupation, the overtly racist, anti-Palestinian rhetoric of these 
organizations has become even more shrill.

<p>Instead of supporting steps toward peace, the Jewish American establishment, 
headed by the America Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the 
Council of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, has actively 
sought to punish the Palestinian Authority through Congressional legislation 
designed to limit its ability to engage in diplomacy, as well as through 
attempts to suspend U.S. and U.N. humanitarian aid to the Palestinian 
people.  This fundamental disconnect between the leadership of the Jewish 
American community and its grassroots demonstrates how this establishment is 
less interested in being representative than it is in advancing actions that 
demonize and hurt Palestinians.

<p>Second, if both Arab and Jewish Americans seem to agree on the path toward a 
just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, then why is there 
so little cooperation between the organizations charged with representing 
our respective communities?  Although the teamwork between AAI and APN that 
brought about this survey is commendable, unfortunately it represents an 
exception rather than the rule.  Both Jewish and Arab organizations, along 
with the grassroots of both communities, need to make a redoubled effort to 
work together and send a powerful message to both our decision-makers in the 
United States and to Israelis and Palestinians that peaceful co-existence is 
possible based on mutual respect and acknowledgment of full and equal 
rights.

<p>Third, if there is indeed so much convergence of views on Middle East peace 
between our two communities, then why are the interests of Jewish and Arab 
Americans often portrayed as being inexorably at odds?  This misconception 
often leads decision-makers into the dangerous trap of believing that U.S. 
foreign policy in the Middle East is a zero-sum game in which the positions 
they adopt will necessarily alienate one or the other community.  Most 
politicians are under the false impression that in order not to upset their 
Jewish American constituents, they have to adopt a blatantly one-sided 
position that strictly aligns U.S. foreign policy with Israel’s military 
occupation of the Palestinian people.  The AAI-APN poll shows the falsity of 
thinking in zero-sum terms and should signal to politicians that they can 
support a balanced foreign policy – which caters to the needs and 
aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians – and still enjoy the support 
of both their Jewish and Arab constituents.

<p>Fourth, if Arab and Jewish Americans are supportive of a just and lasting 
peace between Israelis and Palestinians, then which special interests are 
responsible for preventing the United States from adopting a balanced 
foreign policy toward the conflict?  As it stands today, U.S. foreign policy 
unconditionally supports Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians 
economically, diplomatically, and militarily.  Not only is the Jewish 
American establishment advocating for the continuation of this injustice, 
but they are backed by the fundamentalist Christian Zionist lobby and the 
arms industry, each of which have ulterior motives in supporting policies 
that have nothing to do with the well-being of either Israelis or 
Palestinians.

<p>It is time for politicians in this country to cast aside the special 
interests and listen to the grassroots of their Arab and Jewish 
constituencies, along with the vast majority of all Americans who want to 
see a lasting peace finally take hold in the Middle East.  When this 
happens, we will have an example of a healthy, functioning, representative 
democracy combined with a morally sound foreign policy.
