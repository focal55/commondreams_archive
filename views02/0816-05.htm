<p>CAMBRIDGE, MASS.</SPAN> &#150; In the season finale this past spring of NBC's 
"The West Wing," President Jed Bartlet struggles to decide whether to order the 
assassination of the foreign minister of Qumari (a fictitious Middle Eastern state) 
who is a known terrorist. The climactic scene shows the president arguing against 
the idea with his no-nonsense chief of staff, who, at one point, says something 
to the effect of: "The most horrifying aspect of your liberalism is that you think 
there are moral absolutes." The president felt that it wasn't worth sacrificing 
the basic principles of humanity to order an assassination. The chief of staff 
thought the assassination, while morally dubious, would ultimately save the lives 
of thousands who would suffer if the foreign minister stayed in power. The plot 
thickens. 
<P>A similar back-and-forth has played out between a US District Court judge in 
Washington and the State Department over the past few weeks in a federal case 
of corporate human rights abuse in Indonesia. <a href="http://www.laborrights.org/" target="_new">International 
Labor Rights Fund</a>, a human rights group in Washington, has filed a lawsuit 
alleging that the ExxonMobil Corporation looked the other way when its security 
guards, who are members of Indonesia's military, carried out torture, rape, and 
extrajudicial execution while guarding its plant in war-torn Aceh. The State Department 
recently answered a query by Exxon for its input on the possible foreign policy 
ramifications of allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The State Department's recommendation 
in a letter to the judge: The case should be dismissed because, if litigated, 
the matter could offend the Indonesian government, resulting in the possibility 
of even greater human rights abuse, and a cold shoulder from America's most important 
ally in the war on terror.</P>
<P>So now the real-life judge (Judge Louis Oberdorfer), in considering the State 
Department's recommendation and deciding whether to dismiss the case, faces fictitious 
President Bartlet's quandary: Is calling Exxon to account for its complicity in 
human rights abuse a moral absolute? Or can diplomatic concerns outweigh that 
imperative, effectively putting justice on hold?</P>
<P>In the first place, the State Department's reasons for dismissal are not all 
terribly pressing &#150; or even legitimate &#150; foreign policy concerns. For 
instance, it states in its letter that the lawsuit might anger Indonesia to the 
point where it would drop its ties to American businesses and partner instead 
with countries less concerned about human rights, such as China. If American businesses 
don't behave better than those from less-enlightened countries, what's the point 
of State supporting them in the first place? The argument chases its tail.</P>
<P>A closer question is whether jeopardizing America's relationship with a major 
ally in the war on terror outweighs the importance of seeing a company answer 
to exploitative and harmful business practices. Moderate Muslim areas of southeast 
Asia are already a significant investment for the Bush administration: 1,200 American 
troops in the Philippines have just spent half a year training the military in 
counterterrorism fundamentals, and Indonesia, eager to impress its new Western 
friend, has deported scores of Middle Eastern Muslims on charges of collusion 
with Al Qaeda. Without Indonesia on our side, many say, terrorists fleeing central 
Asia will soon make the southeast their new headquarters.</P>
<P>Yet, I argue that a moral absolute exists. There are certain basic rights, 
standards, and freedoms that must not be compromised, even to avoid future turmoil. 
Among them are freedom from torture, rape, and murder, and the concomitant promise 
that when such freedoms are taken away, the law will find out why.</P>
<P>Sweeping under the rug ExxonMobil's role in unspeakable acts against the citizens 
of Aceh &#150; like ordering the assassination of a despicable foreign leader 
&#150; is tantamount to giving up the principles we fight for as we fight against 
terrorism: The means are poisoned and they sour the end.</P>
<P>Thus a triumph in the war on terror achieved by ignoring human rights abuse 
would be hollow because America's cherished principles &#150; freedom, transparency 
in government, and above all, human dignity &#150; would have been abandoned in 
the relentless drive for victory, making us no better than the terrorists we pursue.</P>
<P>Allowing Exxon to walk free is a moral failure, regardless of its perceived 
long-term benefits, not to mention a hypocritical betrayal of this country's new 
drive toward corporate responsibility.</P>
<P>President Bartlet, under pressure from his chief of staff, ultimately falters 
in his moral stand and orders the assassination. Here's hoping that Judge Oberdorfer 
won't do the same.</P>
