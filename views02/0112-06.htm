<i>The idea of multiculturalism 
                    still holds, says lord <b>BHIKHU PAREKH</b></i>
                  
<p><i>As a thinker, Lord Bhikhu 
                    Parekh has been unafraid to criticise attitudes in his country, 
                    India, and Britain, his adopted homeland. The last time the 
                    professor, one of the leading theorists on the philosophical 
                    underpinnings of multiculturalism, found himself in the thick 
                    of controversy was when the commission he chaired on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain 
                    presented its report in October 2000. There was a huge row 
                    over the Report’s formulation that ‘Britishness’ has racial 
                    connotations, that it is often defined in terms that exclude 
                    ethnic minorities and the people of Scotland. The Professor 
                    at the London School of Economics was recently in New Delhi 
                    for a busy few days. Excerpts from a conversation with VANDITA 
                    MISHRA:</i></p>
<p>&#149; <b>2001 was a troubling 
                    year, when the practice and possibilities of multiculturalism 
                    appeared to be severely challenged. There was September 11 
                    in the US. In India, the year ended with December 13.</b></p>
<p>I WOULD distinguish between 
                    September 11 and December 13. December 13 was a local event, 
                    a group of people wanting to make use of Kashmir to destabilise 
                    not only Kashmir but also India. It was a pure terrorist act. 
                    What happened on September 11 was more than that. </p>
<p>At one level, it was an attempt 
                    to punish the US for what it appeared to have done in Palestinian 
                    territories, Iraq and so on. It was also a symbol of a larger 
                    clash between religious fundamentalism and modernity.</p>
<p>The question is what lessons 
                    can we draw from what happened on September 11. There is one 
                    that has been drawn by American liberals — that there is, 
                    as Samuel P. Huntington laid down, a clash of civilisations; 
                    that Christianity and Islam can never co-exist. And that the 
                    West must find ways of subduing Islamic societies. This, I 
                    believe, is the completely wrong lesson. Islam has been a 
                    part of western consciousness and vice versa for hundreds 
                    of years. To juxtapose these societies as wholly incompatible 
                    civilisations is totally fraudulent.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t take into account 
                    the fact that the Muslim population will constitute almost 
                    a quarter of the world population by the year 2025. How do 
                    you declare a war on a people of this magnitude?
                    I would, therefore, draw the opposite lesson. That unless 
                    different civilisations enter into a dialogue and understand 
                    each other, none will survive and flourish. </p>
<p>The West would continue to 
                    fight Islam, become increasingly militarised and lose its 
                    liberal, democratic character. In order to fight September 
                    11, the US has already bypassed its Constitution, its laws, 
                    locked up people and subjected them to torture. You might 
                    win the war, but only by losing all that you stand for. You 
                    have to find ways to engage each other in dialogue, to create 
                    spaces for, diversity. The world should not be shaped in the 
                    image of the US or the west; it should be a conversation between 
                    civilisations. </p>
<p>&#149; <b>Last year also saw 
                    an increase in racial violence in Britain. There was vicious 
                    rioting in June-July.</b></p>
<p>IN the last three weeks in 
                    Britain, there have been four reports on the riots that happened 
                    earlier in the year. These reports emphasise three things. 
                    One, different communities are leading parallel lives. Eighty 
                    per cent of those involved in the riots were Pakistani Muslims 
                    who live in areas where levels of poverty and unemployment 
                    are much higher than the national average. </p>
<p>Two, they go to different schools, 
                    so future citizens are growing up without sharing a common 
                    educational experience. Three, in this situation, it is easy 
                    for outside, racist elements to create misunderstandings and 
                    spark off explosions.</p>
<p>If you want communities to 
                    understand each other, only multiculturalism shows the way. 
                    Not a ghettoised view of multiculturalism, but an interactive 
                    one, which is the Indian way. It means that all cultures are 
                    part of my common inheritance, reaching out to each other 
                    while being rooted in our own culture. </p>
<p>A culturally footloose group 
                    of people are dangerous. They can be recruits for terrorism.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism must also 
                    go hand in hand with social justice. Philosophically, proponents 
                    of multiculturalism are criticised for being only interested 
                    in culture. My response to that is the politics of recognition 
                    must be integrated with the politics of redistribution. </p>
<p>&#149; <b>But hasn’t discrimination 
                    against Muslims festered as a separate question in western 
                    societies? The liberal establishment has often masked its 
                    prejudice behind posturing on female illiteracy in the Muslim 
                    world, or on female circumcision.</b></p>
<p>LIBERALS know what to do with 
                    racism. They can deal with injustice based on colour. They 
                    have been at the forefront of the anti-racist struggle in 
                    Britain, which has the most powerful legislation against racial 
                    discrimination.</p>
<p>But from the mid- to late 80s, 
                    partly because of the Salman Rushdie affair, a new phenomenon 
                    appeared. And Liberals panicked at Muslim militancy. Because 
                    they have always been uneasy with religion, and that includes 
                    Pandit Nehru in our country. Now, lo and behold, here were 
                    Muslims demanding certain rights based on religion.</p>
<p>The fact is people are being 
                    discriminated against, in terms of employment etc, not just 
                    on the basis of colour, but also religion. There is tremendous 
                    evidence to show discrimination against Muslims. </p>
<p>While the legal system is geared 
                    against race-based prejudice, what about religion-based prejudice? 
                    It is only now that the government has made some attempts 
                    to address this problem head on. There is a greater attempt 
                    among the people to understand Islam. </p>
<p>&#149; <b>In India, do you 
                    see the situation, post-December 13, triggering more intolerance? 
                    There are attempts by the VHP, for instance, to manoeuvre 
                    the current tensions between India and Pakistan to fuel the 
                    Ayodhya ‘‘movement’’.</b></p>
<p>THIS constant tendency to equate 
                    Pakistan with Muslims and Muslims with Pakistan is dangerous. 
                    It completely corrupts our understanding of our domestic situation. 
                    And it is also politically mad. If a small group of Muslims 
                    from outside the country could cause this degree of damage 
                    to India, how will you handle a large chunk of your population 
                    if they become profoundly alienated and dissatisfied? The 
                    Muslim community in India has been exemplary. </p>
<p>Our family life and cultural 
                    life would be infinitely poorer without its contribution. 
                    Although Muslims feel alienated from the national life, though 
                    they have been systematically discriminated against, they 
                    have been intensely loyal. How many Muslims in India demonstrated 
                    for the Taliban? How many went to fight with it? There was 
                    just that remark by the Shahi Imam that Shabana Azmi could 
                    tackle on her own. Why don’t you appreciate this and build 
                    on it? The VHP is being morally irresponsible and politically 
                    suicidal.</p>
<p>&#149; <b>You have written 
                    extensively on Gandhi. Is Gandhi’s way relevant in the present 
                    context? </b></p>
<p> There are important practical 
                    lessons from Gandhi’s life and work. At a time when public 
                    life is so corrupt, let us remember him as a man who only 
                    gave. </p>
<p>If Gandhi had been alive, what 
                    would he have said to Osama bin Laden? The day the terrorist 
                    attack took place, he would have said, you are going down 
                    the wrong way, terrorism is no answer. And once the Americans 
                    started bombing Afghanistan, he would have said to him — if 
                    you love these people, give yourself up for them. You will 
                    also get so much political capital out of it. Then the Americans 
                    will not dare to harm you. </p>
<p>Gandhi was this beautiful combination 
                    of high morality and shrewd calculations. The challenge is 
                    to combine morality with politics, idealism with realism. 
                    The old man did that.</p>
