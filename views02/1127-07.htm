<p>The full effects of the 2001 so-called ``USA Patriot Act'' have not yet 
been felt, fortunately. But one of its first effects has been to benefit the 
president's brother, Marvin.
    <p>Marvin P. Bush, one of George W. Bush's three younger brothers, is 
co-founder and partner in Winston Partners, a private investment firm in 
Alexandria, Va. Winston Partners in turn is part of a larger venture capital 
entity called the Chatterjee Group, headed by venture capitalist Purnendu 
Chatterjee. (Venture capital firms provide money to start-up businesses and 
other companies, usually in return for equity and some managerial say in the 
company.)
    <p>Through this and other business relationships, this Bush sibling is 
positioned to do very well in high-tech activities as a result of provisions 
of the Patriot Act.
    <p>Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that the Chatterjee Group 
consists of Winston Partners, L.P.; and a half-dozen other entities with 
addresses in the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, the Isle of Man and 
Delaware.
    <p>Bush's partner is Scott Andrews, with whom he went to school. Winston 
Partners has two branches, hedge funds and private equity funds, engaged in a 
variety of investments, including global ``outsourcing'' and offshore 
information technology.
    <p>H.R. 3162, called ``The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing 
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act'' (or USA 
Patriot), was designed to prevent money laundering and requires banks to 
``know their customers.''
    <p>Inevitably, many companies are aggressively marketing services to make 
businesses ``Patriot Act''-compliant: that is, they sell computer systems to 
enable banks to argue successfully to Uncle Sam that they're not laundering 
money for terrorists. One of the most aggressive is Sybase Inc., which 
developed a ``Sybase PATRIOT compliance Solution'' months ago. Sybase, which 
said it wanted foreign banks as customers (it already had a deal with the 
People's Bank of China), landed Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in time for the October 
2002 compliance deadline.
    <p>This is where Winston Partners comes in. The Chatterjee Group, including 
Winston Partners, owns 5.5 million shares in Sybase (Chatterjee businesses 
also have been paid thousands more shares in Sybase). SEC filings show that 
Winston Partners LP owns 1,036,075 shares in Sybase; Winston Partners LDC 
holds 1,317,825 shares; and Winston Partners LLC owns 1,221,837 shares. The 
shares owned by the subsidiaries are collectively managed in funds for Winston 
Partners by Pernendu Chatterjee. There is also a Chatterjee Charitable 
Foundation.
    <p>Business for Sybase is business for Bush, and the Patriot Act boosted 
business.
    <p>Not that the Patriot Act is Sybase's only federal conduit. The company is 
also a significant government contractor (especially nowadays), with contracts 
from the Agriculture Department, the Navy ($2.9 million in 2001), the Army 
($1.8 million in 2001), the Defense Department ($5.3 million in 2001), 
Commerce, Treasury and the General Services Administration among others. The 
federal procurement database lists Sybase's total awards for 2001 as 
$14,754,000.
    <p>Sybase is only one of the companies with federal contracts from which 
Marvin Bush's firm derives financial benefit. Winston Partners' portfolio also 
includes Amsec Corp., which got Navy contracts worth $37,722,000 in 2001.
    <p>The potential for abuse here can hardly be overstated. A branch of the 
military or other government agency that risked funding cutbacks, for example, 
could throw up a buffer by awarding a contract benefiting the First Family. 
Why spend money on a lobbyist in the industry, when you might have one in the 
White House?
    <p>Now let's step back and look at the big picture. The president's brother 
is marketing to offshore customers (shipping out American jobs, be it noted). 
He is closely linked to entities marketing ``outsourcing'' and ``global 
alternative investments'' yet more aggressively. Companies associated with 
them are doing other high-end versions of the same. And some companies in 
which they have a stake are involved in the most sensitive technology outside 
nuclear weapons - being marketed simultaneously to the U.S. government, to 
foreign banks and to the states (Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, New Jersey and New 
York also purchase from Sybase). This is ``security"?
    <p>Nor is Marvin Bush the only family member in this picture. His brother Jeb 
Bush, Florida's governor, is also an investor in the Winston Capital Fund, 
managed by Marvin Bush's firm. And Indigo Systems Corp., another federal 
contractor ($2,629,000 in 2001 from Defense and NASA), is substantially backed 
by The Carlyle Group, the global finance company connected to George H.W. 
Bush.
    <p>As we used to say in Texas, son of a gun.
    <p>There is a crying need for oversight and accountability, but the need has 
yet to be met.
