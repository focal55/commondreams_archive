<p>Your Excellencies: 

<p>There is much truth in an assessment attributed to journalist Alan Nairn that 

the United States “wields power that no nation should have. It can go anywhere 

and kill anyone. Only the American public can hold Washington back. Only the American 

people stand between the bombers and the bombed.” Still, I’m writing today to 

urge your government, as a member-state of the United Nations Security Council, 

to use every possible nonviolent means to resist the government of my country, 

the United States of America, in its quest to consolidate and extend its global 

military and economic hegemony. As a first step, I urge your government to reject 

any proposed Security Council resolutions the Bush administration may conceivably 

invoke to violently topple the odious regime of Saddam Hussein. 

<p>Recently, the US government released its “National Security Strategy.” Here, 

the Bush administration states openly the militaristic foreign policy US governments 

have actively, if less forthrightly, pursued since at least the end of World War 

II. “America,” we are told, “will act against . . . emerging threats before they 

are fully formed” because “the only path to peace and security is the path of 

[military] action.” And if the international community is not convinced of the 

necessity, legality, or justness of America’s “path of action” then the US “will 

not hesitate to act alone” and “if necessary, act preemptively”. 

<p>The US government has also served notice that not only will it pursue <i>full 

spectrum dominance</i> on the battlefield but it will also use its might to “dissuade 

potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, 

or equaling, the power of the United States.” Possessing unrivaled conventional 

military forces, thousands of weapons of mass destruction, and a demonstrated 

willingness to use them, the US represents a frightening conjuncture of imperialist 

ability and aspiration. 

<p>British historian Alfred Toynbee’s 1967 observation about the United States 

is well-taken. He said: 

<p><i>&quot;America . . . now stands for what Rome stood for. Rome consistently 

supported the rich against the poor in all foreign communities that fell under 

her sway; and, since the poor, so far, have always and everywhere been far more 

numerous than the rich, Rome’s policy made for inequality, for injustice, and 

for the least happiness of the greatest number.&quot;</i>

<p>I am not so naïve as to suppose the poor figure very prominently in the foreign 

or domestic policy of your government. However, I do trust you realize that, where 

they do not coincide, America, like Rome before her, puts the interests of her 

empire and her rich ahead of those of the rich in your country. Thus, your government 

has some stake in creating a world system where no one country or small bloc of 

countries can jeopardize the security of another country merely on the basis of 

“national interest.” 

<p>Furthermore, the consequences of America’s misguided, militarized foreign policy 

have been horrific and far-reaching even for countries not conceivably on the 

short list for a US invasion. For example, while most of the hijackers came from 

the repressive US-client state of Saudi Arabia, the terrorist atrocities of September 

11, 2001, can be traced back to US support for Muslim extremists seeking to overthrow 

the government of Afghanistan which, as expected, prompted a Soviet invasion. 

Years of bloodshed and upheaval followed, fueled by American and Soviet arms and 

funds. From this mayhem, with US, Saudi, and Pakistani backing, emerged Osama 

bin Laden, al-Qaida and the Taleban. These erstwhile associates of the US government 

are, among other things, the most likely perpetrators of the World Trade Center 

bombings, which, to say the least, killed the citizens of many different countries. 

<p>Although the serious terrorist threats and repulsive regimes, such as that 

of Saddam Hussein, that have resulted from America’s foreign policy must be effectively 

addressed, they should not be addressed by adding fuel to the flames, least of 

all by the US. The United States must no longer be allowed to overthrow the governments 

of other sovereign states. The US government will no doubt engage in bribery and 

bullying in an attempt to advance its agenda; the pressure for your government 

to capitulate will be great. However, in consideration of the long-term consequences 

of any appeasement to American aggression and militarism I hope your government 

will rise to the challenge and mobilize nonviolently but decisively against America’s 

imperialist aspirations and actions.
