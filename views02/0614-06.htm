<p>By the end of July a US district court will decide whether drug giant Pfizer 
should stand trial in the United States for presiding over a coercive, botched 
1996 experiment on Nigerian children with meningitis. In a class-action suit filed 
last August, thirty Nigerian families say the company violated the Nuremberg Code 
by forcing an unapproved, risky experiment on unwitting subjects who suffered 
brain damage, loss of hearing, paralysis and death as a result. </p>
<p> If allowed, the case will open a rare window on a business generally shrouded 
in FDA and Big Pharma secrecy: the global commerce in human experimentation. Over 
the past decade, the drug industry has quietly exported its clinical testing overseas, 
where oversight is slim and patients plentiful. According to a largely unnoticed 
Health and Human Services (HHS) report, the number of foreign investigators seeking 
FDA approvals increased sixteenfold between 1990 and 1999. The actual numbers 
are probably much higher--companies aren't required to alert the FDA before taking 
their research overseas, nor does the FDA track research by location after approving 
new drugs. </p>
<p> Globalizing clinical research solves the pharmaceutical paradox that while 
the average American brings home more than ten prescriptions a year, just one 
in 350 is willing to play guinea pig for new drug testing. An abundance of poor, 
undertreated and doctor-trusting patients in Eastern Europe, Latin America and 
Southeast Asia renders the quick, positive results corporate sponsors need to 
get new drugs approved fast. According to one review, a whopping 99 percent of 
controlled trials published in China bestowed positive results upon the treatment 
under investigation. </p>
<p> Although the HHS report found that the "FDA cannot assure the same level of 
human subject protections in foreign trials as domestic ones," industry officials 
say that companies have little interest in bending the rules. "Occasionally things 
go wrong," allows Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America official 
Caroline Loew. But generally speaking, she says, "companies that are investing 
$800 million in every single drug are not going to waste money on trials that 
don't meet [the FDA's] exacting standards." Loew says that companies test new 
drugs abroad so they can sell them to needy foreign patients. </p>
<p> Analysts disagree. "There may be a market" in some developing countries, says 
Tufts University's drug-development expert Kenneth Kaitin, "but they are really 
interested in the United States, Europe and Japan," which dominate more than 80 
percent of the global drug market. Indeed, all this foreign experimentation can 
hardly be counted on to develop malaria vaccines or cure multidrug-resistant TB. 
"The diseases that are of most interest are mainly the degenerative diseases--arthritis, 
obesity, heart disease--the diseases of people in the developed world," says South 
African bioethicist Dr. Solomon Benatar. </p>
<p> Just 0.3 percent of the drug industry's much-touted R&amp;D resulted in the 
handful of drugs approved for tropical diseases between 1975 and 1997, despite 
tens of thousands of industry-sponsored clinical trials conducted around the world 
every year. Currently, US companies are investigating treatments for oral cancer 
in China, lupus in Mexico and severe short stature in Eastern Europe, among other 
studies--not exactly a list of the world's most pressing public health problems. 
</p>
<p> Even if Americans were willing to participate in trials, they take so many 
medications that they make poor lab rats anyway, clinical researchers say. To 
prove a new drug safe and effective, "you want patients with no other disease 
states and no other treatments. Then you can say relatively clearly that whatever 
happens to those patients is from the drug," says MDS Pharma's Simon Yaxley, whose 
company sells what industry PR folks call "patient recruitment solutions" in Eastern 
Europe, South Africa, Latin America and China. In developing countries, many people, 
because they are poor and don't have access to clinicians and hospitals, aren't 
taking any medicines for their illnesses. </p>
<p> Not only do experiments on such patients yield clearer results, but recruitment 
is rapid. "Say you need 1,000 patients in your trial. If you tried Western Europe, 
it would take you a long time to find untreated patients," Yaxley says. In a developing 
country, "you might find those patients in half the time." After all, "the healthcare 
systems aren't as sophisticated," he adds, and "because of that, there is an increased 
interest in accessing drugs via clinical research, and therefore we can leverage 
that interest." Indeed, consumer health advocates say that clinical trials are 
the only way some poor patients can get any formal healthcare at all. </p>
<p> Government bureaucracy overwhelms clinical research in the United States, 
scientists complain, but in developing countries "there is tremendous government 
cooperation," says Kaitin. "The governments of China, India and Taiwan are bending 
over backward to get these companies to conduct research and manufacture there. 
They are giving tax breaks, building facilities. In Taiwan, many hospitals have 
switched overall record-keeping to English, so if Western companies want to do 
a clinical trial there, they will have no problem." </p>
<p> Conveniently, many of the FDA's ponderous regulations stop at the border. 
For example, the FDA's requirement that companies prove that their experimental 
drugs are safe on animals before starting tests on humans doesn't apply for tests 
conducted outside the United States. And experiments on Americans must undergo 
painstaking, lengthy reviews by government-regulated "institutional review boards" 
(IRBs). But "if you go to some countries and say you want the IRB to review this, 
they say, 'What is an IRB?'" comments Dennis DeRosia, chair of the Association 
of Clinical Research Professionals. The FDA simply requires that foreign trials 
conform to the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki, a series of 
ethical recommendations that critics call rudimentary, nonbinding and ambiguous. 
Scientists routinely ignore Helsinki directives to publish negative results and 
make study designs public, and they liken Helsinki-required ethics committees 
in developing countries to rubber stamps. "No ethical questions are raised at 
all," one investigator admitted to the National Bioethics Advisory Commission 
(NBAC). </p>
<p> What results is one set of acceptable risks for patients at home and quite 
another for patients abroad, a double standard that has left hundreds of preventable 
deaths in its wake. Most notoriously, in the mid- and late 1990s, the National 
Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control funded and defended studies 
in which Western scientists withheld treatment from HIV-infected pregnant women 
in developing countries, even though they knew antiretroviral drugs would reduce 
the rate of HIV infection in their infants by two-thirds. Hundreds of infants 
"needlessly contracted HIV infection" while Western doctors presided over their 
care, according to an incendiary <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> paper 
by Public Citizen's Dr. Peter Lurie and Dr. Sidney Wolfe. </p>
<p> It wasn't that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs weren't available to the 
scientists--the manufacturer offered them free to clinical researchers. Rather, 
the demands of scientific rigor required that some sick patients go untreated, 
as NIH and CDC officials explained in a later <i>NEJM</i> issue. Only by observing 
how these untreated patients fared and comparing their outcomes with those of 
experimental treatments could scientists quickly and decisively determine whether 
the experimental treatments worked, they wrote. Comparing experimental treatments 
to antiretroviral therapy--standard in the West but deemed too expensive, risky 
and difficult to administer in poor countries--could only prove whether new treatments 
equaled or improved upon antiretroviral therapy. But in some cases, "the really 
relevant question is whether this quick, cheap, easy thing works. You don't really 
care if the thing works better," explains international-health ethicist Nancy 
Kass. "What you care about is, does it work, period." Plus, since none of the 
study subjects could have afforded antiretroviral drugs at the time, NIH's Dr. 
Harold Varmus and CDC's Dr. David Satcher argued, "the assignment to a placebo 
group does not carry a risk beyond that associated with standard practice." </p>
<p> Such justifications, retorted former <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> 
editor Marcia Angell, "are reminiscent of those for the Tuskegee study"--a kind 
of ethical relativism that results in "widespread exploitation of vulnerable Third 
World populations for research programs that could not be carried out in the sponsoring 
country." </p>
<p> Government-funded scientists' willingness to sacrifice a few African lives 
in search of a cheap, effective way to save many more backfired nastily when South 
African parliamentarian Peter Mokaba recently charged South Africa's new AIDS-treatment 
programs with foisting dangerous and unnecessary Western drugs upon an unsuspecting 
African public. According to the <i>New York Times</i>, recent revelations of 
improper conduct in an NIH-funded HIV-transmission trial in Uganda intensified 
South Africans' receptivity to Mokaba's dangerous accusations. "You set yourself 
up for these kinds of problems if you don't conduct your study properly," says 
Lurie. "The researchers have to take responsibility for this." </p>
<p> By all accounts, the quest for rapid results sent Pfizer scientists jetting 
to Nigeria in late March 1996. Pfizer scientists had been industriously collecting 
data on its experimental broad-spectrum antibiotic Trovan when one of the worst 
epidemics of meningococcal meningitis broke out in Nigeria. The scourge presented 
a golden opportunity to test their hot new drug, which they suspected could effectively 
treat meningitis in oral form, bypassing the painful injections their competitors' 
drugs required. "We had to move quickly," a Pfizer spokesperson told the <i>Washington 
Post</i>. In Nigeria, where the contagion infected more than 100,000, the company 
could test Trovan on hundreds of patients in a matter of weeks. </p>
<p> The Nigerian government was happy to cooperate, arranging for the company's 
accommodation and silencing criticism from local physicians, according to court 
documents. The FDA granted permission to export the experimental medicine the 
very same day it was requested, Pfizer says. And a Nigerian hospital ethics committee 
sanctioned the study design, as required by Helsinki, the company claims. Not 
so, confessed two Nigerian doctors to the <i>Post </i>in January 2001. "There 
was no ethical committee at the time of the trial, none met, and no approval was 
properly given for the trial," said one. The "approval" document was cobbled together 
long after the experiment concluded and was then backdated, the other doctor said. 
And Pfizer's study design was dangerously risky, critics say. One of Pfizer's 
own scientists, Dr. Juan Walterspiel, warned management that the study methods 
were "improper and unsafe" before and after the study was conducted, acts of integrity 
that led to his swift dismissal. </p>
<p> The company, in a heady mix of haste and arrogance, planned to give 100 deathly 
ill Nigerian children experimental Trovan either orally or by injection, and compare 
their outcomes to 100 others given shots of competitor Roche's FDA-approved Rocephin. 
But an oral form of Trovan, though convenient, was too risky to test on dangerously 
sick poor kids, Walterspiel complained. "Some of the children were in critical 
condition and most of them malnourished, which made oral absorption even more 
unpredictable," Walterspiel wrote to Pfizer officials in a December 18, 1997, 
letter. According to Nigerian families' class-action suit against the company, 
Pfizer then forced sick children into its study, failing to inform them either 
of the experimental nature of the drug they'd be subjected to or the availability 
of WHO-approved meningitis treatment from a nearby Doctors Without Borders team. 
Not a single Helsinki-required informed-consent form was signed, the company admits. 
No witnesses signed statements attesting to the "verbal consent" Pfizer claims 
to have obtained either, the company admits on its website. "These people had 
no idea they were part of any clinical trial," says Elaine Kusel, an attorney 
representing the Nigerian families suing Pfizer. </p>
<p> It wasn't the first Third World trial involving lack of consent. One analysis 
of South African patients who had participated in a study of HIV transmission 
found that almost 90 percent felt forced into the trial. Thirteen percent of researchers 
interviewed by NBAC said they weren't sure if their study participants were aware 
that they were in a research project. "Informed consent is a joke," a clinical 
investigator who worked in developing countries commented to NBAC. Pfizer scientists 
took other liberties as well. When some children resisted the painful Rocephin 
shots, Pfizer scientists slashed the dose to one-third the FDA-approved levels. 
This unapproved, reckless deviation from the study protocol endangered lives, 
Kusel charges. Pfizer disputes the claim. </p>
<p> The extent of the damage from Trovan and the low dose of Rocephin remains 
unclear. Pfizer claims it lost just 6 percent of its patients in both the Trovan 
and Rocephin groups, proving that oral and injected Trovan worked as well as Rocephin. 
But the company didn't adequately track the long-term recovery of its patients, 
Kusel says. Initial fatality rates may have been relatively low, but with only 
one follow-up visit (the FDA recommended two in 1998), nobody knows how many children 
ended up deaf, brain-damaged or dead--whether from meningitis, experimental Trovan 
or a low dose of Rocephin, she says. </p>
<p> Pfizer defends the study by stressing that the FDA itself found little seriously 
amiss when it reviewed the data in 1997, a fact maybe more suggestive of the FDA's 
selective oblivion than Pfizer's propriety. While the agency did decline to consider 
Pfizer's application, noting "discrepancies," it didn't object to the lack of 
signed consent forms or note problems with the ethics-approval letter, the company 
says. The agency's approval of Trovan for no less than fourteen adult indications 
netted Pfizer more than $160 million until reports of liver damage led the FDA 
to pull the plug in 1999. </p>
<p> The trial would have remained Pfizer's dirty little secret had the <i>Washington 
Post </i>not unearthed it in a late 2000 investigative series. The sensational, 
John le Carr&eacute;-like story of coercive experimentation brought thousands 
of Nigerians into the streets, launching belated Nigerian and FDA inquiries. In 
a flurry of outrage, US Representatives Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde sponsored a 
patient-protection amendment to the Export Administration Act, which would make 
it more difficult for companies to export experimental medicines abroad. </p>
<p> But Pfizer stands by its study. On its website the company argues that given 
the impoverished, squalid conditions Pfizer found in Nigeria, patients ought to 
have deemed themselves lucky to get the cutting-edge medical care and upgraded 
local facilities that Pfizer's trial offered. "Overall medical care substantially 
improved due to the presence of this clinical trial," Pfizer says. </p>
<p> This specious argument, that "whatever we do is better than nothing," as Nigerian 
physician Alphonsus Obayuwana put it, underpins ongoing attempts to rationalize 
shoddy treatment of poor patients in developing countries. In January 2001, for 
instance, as part of a trial of a new drug, Discovery Laboratories planned to 
administer saltwater or air placebos to 325 deathly ill premature infants--arguing 
that in the poorly equipped Latin American hospitals where the trial would be 
conducted, patients couldn't afford effective drugs anyway. Discovery admitted 
to the FDA that its new surfactant drug, called Surfaxin, probably wouldn't improve 
upon any of the four surfactants the agency had approved since 1990, according 
to internal FDA documents procured by Public Citizen. But however marginal Surfaxin's 
contribution to patient care, the drug would be easier to manufacture, the company 
says. Since the FDA only requires that new drugs prove effective--not more effective 
than already approved drugs--Discovery planned to seek FDA approval by showing 
that Surfaxin was better than nothing. The problem of finding parents of dying 
infants desperate enough to risk being assigned to a placebo group could be overcome 
by exporting the trial to impoverished Latin American hospitals, "where other 
drugs in its class are approved, but not standard of care because of financial 
limitations or government rationing," FDA officials explained in an agency review 
of the study. </p>
<p> After Public Citizen stepped up pressure, the company redesigned the study 
without placebos in April 2001, but FDA medical policy associate director Dr. 
Robert Temple, who participated in an agency review of the study, defends the 
original study design. "At present nobody in the places where the study would 
have been done is getting surfactant," he told me. "If they did, the trial half 
of the people would get surfactant and better perinatal care, and the other half 
would get better perinatal care. It seems to me all the people in the trial would 
have been better off." Indeed, Public Citizen's Lurie says, Discovery intended 
to upgrade research sites to the standards of a Western intensive-care unit--"they 
just wouldn't squirt active drug down the tube." </p>
<p> The international health advocates one would expect to mount a noisy campaign 
against shoddy corporate trials have been surprisingly muted. There's a certain 
wariness about imposing impossible demands and idealistic ethical standards on 
companies that can easily take their business elsewhere. Doctors Without Borders, 
the WHO and other international health organizations have made increasing corporate 
research interest in the Third World a primary goal, making critiques of such 
trials secondary, at least for now. "It takes half a second to look at how much 
more burdened the developing world is with ill health and disability. What we 
need, if anything, is more health research in the developing world, not less," 
says Johns Hopkins bioethicist Ruth Faden. Plus, even when companies aim for rich 
Western consumers, testing new drugs on poor patients "brings benefits to the 
patients. They get special attention and potential therapy," adds HIV researcher 
Arthur Ammann, who has tried to convince drug companies to run more trials in 
developing countries. </p>
<p> Watchdogs like Public Citizen's Health Research Group vociferously decry unethical 
study designs but can do little to police study conduct, which both the FDA and 
the drug industry view as secret, "proprietary" information. Ethics documents 
issued by international associations such as the World Medical Association and 
the WHO/UNESCO's Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, 
as important as they are, are alarmingly toothless. Pharma companies themselves 
have attempted a voluntary "harmonization" of clinical research standards abroad 
to meet FDA standards but, not surprisingly, such efforts are frighteningly nascent 
in many developing countries. </p>
<p> In the end, such voluntary endeavors, while crucial, are hardly sufficient 
to protect the would-be guinea pigs of the world sacrificed on the altar of Big 
Pharma profit. The IRB reviews, FDA approvals and the like that protect patients 
at home need to be not only universal but mandatory. With any luck, the class-action 
suit against Pfizer will strengthen the argument for such protections--at least 
until the gap between Western elites glutted on the latest medicines and a world 
majority lacking access to simple antibiotics somehow begins to close.</p>
