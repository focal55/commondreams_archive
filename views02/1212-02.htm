<p>ON TELEVISION, the good guys almost always catch the criminal by the 
last commercial. But in real life, criminals disappear and reappear with 
puzzling unpredictability.
<P>American intelligence operations, for example, have been unable to locate 
Osama bin Laden, the 6-foot-4 bearded al Qaeda leader who masterminded the 
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. From somewhere -- a cave or a trawler on the 
high seas -- he still directs a multinational terrorist organization and 
taunts and threatens American officials.
<P>Mullah Omar, the one-eyed enigmatic Taliban leader, has also disappeared. 
Every so often, some farmer spots him wandering in the mountains of 
Afghanistan, but American forces have been unable to find him as well.
<P>The anthrax killer has also vanished -- after sending deadly spores through 
the postal system to members of Congress and the media. According to Barbara 
Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular biologist with the Federation of American 
Scientists, the FBI knew within two weeks that the strain of anthrax 
originated within the U.S. bio-defense program. This has led some to wonder if 
the government would prefer that the culprit remain undiscovered. If missing, 
he can't reveal secrets about our government's biological weapons research 
labs.
<P>But despite these intelligence lapses, give the Bush administration credit 
for capturing an impressive crowd of prominent former criminals.
<P>John Poindexter, for example, has emerged from relative obscurity to head 
the new Orwellian office of Total Information Awareness, housed in the 
Pentagon. Once a national security adviser to President Reagan, Poindexter 
helped mastermind the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scam that sought to evade 
congressional will. In 1990, he was convicted of five felony counts (later 
overturned on a technicality) for lying to Congress. Now he is armed with an 
immense database that can track all our of lives through government and 
commercial sources.
<P>Also resurrected is Elliot Abrams, another veteran of the Iran-Contra 
scandal. President Bush has just appointed him director of Middle Eastern 
affairs. In 1987, Abrams pleaded guilty to withholding information from 
Congress. Five years later, Bush senior pardoned him.
<P>Don't forget John Negroponte and Otto Reich, also veterans of the Iran-
Contra scam. They are now, respectively, our ambassador to the United Nations 
and special envoy for the Western Hemisphere affairs at the State Department.
<P>Henry Kissinger is also back, though not by popular demand. President Bush 
chose him to lead the independent commission that will investigate why our 
government failed to prevent the deadly terrorist attacks against American 
civilians. For the record, Kissinger has not been charged with any crime, 
though many believe he committed more than a few when he conducted government 
affairs in secrecy and with deceit. His harshest critics, moreover, have 
accused him of war crimes -- of orchestrating the secret bombing of Cambodia 
and the violent overthrow of Salvador Allende, the elected president of Chile, 
in 1973.
<P>Even Jim Crow -- long thought dead after the passage of civil rights laws 
in the 1960s -- made a surprise appearance when Senate Republican leader Trent 
Lott of Mississippi praised retiring Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., for having 
defended white supremacy and legal segregation.
<P>Well, there you have it. Call it what you will -- coddling criminals or 
compassionate conservatism -- but this is the Bush administration's quixotic 
record for finding and bringing criminals to justice.</p>
