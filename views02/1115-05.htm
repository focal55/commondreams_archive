<p>The memorial service for Senator Wellstone, his wife Sheila and 
daughter Marcia at the Washington Hebrew Congregation in Washington, DC 
on November 13, 2002 was a fitting and diverse tribute from their two 
sons, Mark and David, Senatorial colleagues, staff and friends.

    <p>With each heartfelt expression, the assemblage understood what 
Senator Tom Daschle meant when he said "so much was lost in that crash."

    <p>Paul and Sheila Wellstone were there always for the poor, the 
homeless, the sick and the defenseless.  They championed justice for 
millions of people and traveled to their places of distress to see their 
plight first-hand.  Senator Wellstone always wanted to see situations 
for himself - in Bosnia, Thailand, Columbia, American prisons.

    <p>Yesterday the Associated Press called me to ask who would take the 
place of Paul Wellstone in the U.S. Senate.  I had no answer because now 
there is no one with his sense of consistent, determined energy on so 
many issues, so many networks, so many strategies.

    <p>Anyone who visited him in his Senate offices was greeted so warmly 
and authentically that it was like coming home.  His phrase -- "Never 
separate the lives you live from the words you speak" is one for the 
book of quotations.  it is also a self-description of Paul and Sheila.

    <p>In the Senate, Wellstone was identified by his support for raising 
the frozen minimum wage, for renewable energy and for opposition to 
corporate lobbyists who demand corporate welfare, tax escapes (to 
Bermuda tax havens), and lax enforcement of the corporate crime laws.  
He took on the tobacco companies, the drug companies and the health 
insurance giants.

    <p>But perhaps Paul and Sheila Wellstone's greatest passion 
was legislation which would give mental health patients health insurance 
parity with those suffering from physical illness.  At the memorial 
service, Republican Senator Pete Domenici, tossed aside his prepared 
remarks to speak about how he met Paul Wellstone at a meeting of mental 
health advocates.  His affection for the Minnesota Senator was apparent 
when he vowed that the parity bill he and Wellstone have co-authored 
would be enacted by the Congress next year and would be known as "the 
Paul Wellstone memorial mental health parity law."

    <p>Senator Wellstone's desk in the Senate is now shrouded in black.  
His Senate colleagues unanimously passed legislation to apply $10 
million to establish the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community 
Building in St. Paul, Minnesota.

    The Wellstones understood to their core the meaning of Jean Monnet's 
words -- "Without people nothing is possible, but without institutions 
nothing is lasting."  The essence of community is the banding together 
of people to do for themselves and posterity what they could not do 
alone -- both in the civic society and in government.

      
<p>The last bill Paul Wellstone introduced was S.3143, known as the consumer and 
shareholder protection association. It was legislation that would facilitate through 
inserts in mailings of large publicly traded corporations, including financial 
institutions, invitations to their customers to join together voluntarily in non-profit 
associations that would defend their interests. (for full text see <a href="http://www.essential.org" target="_new">essential.org</a>). 
<p>The corporate crime wave and the looting of the pensions and 401ks 
of millions of Americans losing trillions of dollars worried Wellstone.  
He wanted to help build institutions of investor and consumer influence 
to prevent recurrences in the future.

    <p>After the fatal airplane crash, commentators were awed by 
the outpouring of praise for Wellstone by friends and adversaries
alike.  
<p>What was it about this politician that led his strongest opponents in 
the Congress to weep when they heard the news?  Certainly, it was his 
friendly personality and his personal interest in their own family 
tragedies.  They all had a Paul Wellstone story dear to their heart.  
But it was mainly what Senator Daschle called the rarest of traits -- 
"his moral courage."  Something  maybe they had wished on themselves 
long ago.

    <p>Garrison Keillor commemorated Wellstone in his nationally syndicated 
public radio program with these words: "Paul Wellstone identified 
passionately with people at the bottom, people in trouble, people in the 
rough.  He was an old-fashioned Democrat who felt more at home with the 
rank and file than with the rich and famous."

    <p>At the short end of some 99 to 1 of 95 to 5 votes in the Senate, 
Wellstone's problem was that he did not have enough "old-fashioned 
Democrats" with him in the Senate.  There may come a time when his 
statement that "politics is not about power; it is about people" will 
attract many more dedicated adherents throughout the land.</p>
