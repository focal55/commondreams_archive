<p>Subprime lenders have been marching up to state legislators around the 
nation with a stern warning-"enact protections for borrowers and you 
will trigger a quick and certain reduction of credit for thousands of 
low, moderate and middle income borrowers."
	<p>But, the hard facts coming out of the states with the courage to stop 
predatory and other unfair lending practices are putting the lie to the 
lenders' scare campaign.
	<p>Last summer, Morgan Stanley, a major financial services firm, surveyed 
300 branch mangers and loan officers from five of the largest subprime 
home equity originators and independent mortgage brokers.  The
conclusion from these front-line subprime operators was that predatory 
lending protections had not significantly dampened loan growth.
	<p>That was the finding for Georgia, New York and North Carolina which 
provide the toughest protections as well as for Connecticut, California, 
Florida and Pennsylvania which have enacted more limited protections 
against predatory lending practices.
	<p>In fact, Morgan Stanley's survey concluded that the more consumer 
friendly lending practices required in these states had lowered loan 
costs and appear to be boosting volume, not drying up credit.
	
<p>Morgan Stanley's survey is supported by a study of the North Carolina anti-predatory 
statute conducted by the <a href="http://www.responsiblelending.org/" target="_new">Center 
for Responsible Lending</a>. 
<p>The Center said no major subprime lenders (lenders with more than one 
percent of the market) left North Carolina after enactment of the 
consumer protections. More important, the organization estimated that 
the curbs on predatory lending had saved North Carolina consumers at 
least $100 million in 2000.
	<p>Subprime borrowers with blemished credit histories are regarded as high 
risk and, as a result, predatory lenders take advantage of their
vulnerability and weak bargaining position, charging them inflated 
interest rates and loan points, attaching costly "add-ons" like credit 
insurance, luring them into repeated fee-ridden refinancings and 
unaffordable repayment plans. Some of the predatory interest rates range 
up to eight percent above the average subprime rates.  The end result is 
often bankruptcies and foreclosures.
	<p>Consumer protections adopted by North Carolina and a handful of other 
state legislatures have been bright spots in this dismal world of 
predatory lending. Congress, in contrast, has been  paralyzed by massive 
campaign funds from the entire range of financial interests, including 
predatory lenders. There have been some brave statements for the record, 
but nothing even remotely akin to remedial action in the federal 
legislature.
	<p>While Congress looks the other way, the Federal Trade Commission, at 
least, has weighed in on behalf of consumers.  Its most noteworthy 
effort was a lawsuit against giant Citigroup, charging widespread 
abusive lending practices and violations of the Truth in Lending Act, 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
	<p>Jodie Bernstein, director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said 
Citigroup's newly acquired affiliate-Associates First Capital-engaged in 
a wide variety of deceptive practices.
	<p>"They hid essential information from consumers, misrepresented loan 
terms, flipped loans and packed in optional fees to raise the costs of 
the loans," Bernstein charged.
	  <p>In September, Citigroup threw in the towel and entered into a $215 million 
        settlement with FTC. The fund will be distributed among the victims of 
        Citigroup's deceptive lending practices. 
      <p>Despite FTC's effort against Citigroup predatory lending practices and 
the adoption of some protections in some states, consumer across the 
nation continue to be victimized by predatory and near predatory lending 
practices.  The fast buck, deceptive operators range from the 
established international giants like Citigroup to the back alley loan 
sharks which are equally adept at separating the poor and the near poor 
from their hard-earned money.
	<p>Knowing Congress is a safe-haven against any meaningful federal
sanctions on predatory lending, the financial industry-ranging from
finance companies to multi-billion dollar banks-will be chipping away at
what state protections have been enacted and making sure that the idea
of consumer protection doesn't spread to other states.
	<p>In Georgia, lenders like Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation,
Ameriquest, Option On, and New Century Financial Corporation are
launching new attacks on that state's Fair Lending Law, threatening to
leave the state if the law isn't repealed.  Hopefully, the findings of
recent surveys like those conducted at Morgan Stanley will give state
legislators the courage to stand fast on consumer protections for
borrowers.
	<p>In addition to the state laws, consumers need the protection of a strong 
federal statute against all aspects of predatory lending in all
50 states. But, the nation is faced with one of the most
corporate-oriented anti-consumer Congresses in our history. The
predatory lenders and other practitioners of deceptive and unfair credit
practices fully expect that the Congress will continue to look the other
way when consumer credit protections are mentioned.
    	<p>Two and one half  years ago, I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan about the lack of action and he agreed that "enough was 
enough" on the excesses of predatory lending. Unfortunately, the Federal 
Reserve has taken only small steps to curb the practices.  Not only the 
Federal Reserve, but the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision need 
to place a priority on ending this outrageous gouging of innocent low 
and moderate and middle income families.</p>
