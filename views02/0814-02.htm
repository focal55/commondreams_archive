<p>BAD TIMING is only one of several problems afflicting George W. Bush's Waco 
Economic Summit. The economy is just not cooperating with his upbeat message.
<P>A second major industry, airlines, is now joining the telecommunications collapse 
as evidence that the economy faces more than a crisis of investor confidence. 
The Federal Reserve has been keeping the economy afloat with interest rate cuts, 
but despite economic weakness, it declined yesterday to cut rates further. Last 
week, the Commerce Department quietly and sheepishly released revised statistics 
showing that the recession of 2001 was more serious and prolonged than originally 
thought.</P>
<P>The Waco event needs to be understood mainly as theater. The same cynical producers 
who recruited African-American tokens to integrate the 2000 Republican National 
Convention unearthed a handful of ''ordinary'' Americans to come to Waco mainly 
for their value as props. But, for the most part, Bush's summiteers are the usual 
suspects who have brought the economy to its current pass. Serious critics of 
corporate corruption were not welcome.</P>
<P>Imagine a genuine economic summit, with a wide range of dissenting views. It 
might ask: How do we restore honesty and transparency to the governance of corporations? 
The legislation that Bush recently signed (after it became clear that it was unstoppable) 
is only the beginning.</P>
<P>For example, a Wall Street Journal investigation recently reported that insiders 
in the telecom industry sold about $18 billion of stock in companies that they 
were touting to the public, just as these companies were about to tank. This was 
all perfectly legal. The options game, also entirely legal, is likewise rigged 
in favor of insiders and is a virtual invitation for corporate executives to manipulate 
share prices. Aren't there enough ordinary incentives for successful entrepreneurs 
to get rich without gimmicks to cheat investors? If Bush were serious, he would 
appoint a blue ribbon group of critics to devise fundamental reforms.</P>
<P>A true summit on the economy also might explore just where deregulation went 
so badly awry. The now disgraced accounting profession, the nearly bankrupt telecom 
industry, and the sputtering airlines have one thing in common. All were deregulated 
in the name of the holy free market.</P>
<P>In the case of accountants (who contributed tens of millions of dollars to 
both parties), the deregulation was implicit. Whenever SEC chairman Arthur Levitt 
tried to crack down on accounting abuses, leading legislators of both parties 
simply threatened the SEC's budget.</P>
<P>In the case of phone companies and airlines, the deregulation was explicit 
bipartisan policy. But the experiment failed. For these are industries where one 
airline seat or one dial tone is pretty much like another, and true competition 
turns ruinous. Too many companies invest in too much capacity, and then nobody 
can turn a profit. </P>
<P>The airlines and phone companies compensate for the lost revenue by gouging 
consumers whenever the opportunity arises. But evidently the gouging is not sufficient 
to keep them profitable. US Airways, with choice monopoly routes and dominance 
of several key hubs, still could not make a living. The third scandal-ridden industry, 
electric power, is another case where deregulation invited abuses and only raised 
prices. Hard as it is to grasp, regulation of such industries is necessary to 
protect both consumers and shareholders.</P>
<P>A real economic summit might look closely at another sector that profoundly 
affects real people - health care - where both parties are pursuing only the most 
partial of reforms. Inadequate prescription drug covers for seniors-only and a 
watered down patients' rights bill are subjects fierce of partisan debate while 
the big issue - universal coverage - is simply off the table.</P>
<P>What is the connection between these ignored issues and the faltering economy? 
The connection is wasted resources. The telecom bubble attracted $2 trillion of 
investment capital that went to no useful purpose. The corporate abuses, options 
scams, needless mergers and acquisitions all enriched insiders, but added little 
economic value. The economy cannot afford this waste.</P>
<P>HMOs spend a small fortune trying to avoid insuring patients who might get 
sick, while hospitals and doctors spend billions trying to collect money owed 
them by HMOs. A universal system would waste less money, which could be redirected 
to patient care. Bush's Economic Summit is a political version of Tom Stoppard's 
play, ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,'' where trivial characters and 
issues usurp the audience's attention, while the important themes are tantalizingly 
offstage.</P>
<P>For a day, the summit may provide some diversion and entertainment. But the 
real problems affecting the real economy lie beyond the ingenuity of creative 
theater.</P>
