<p>Did you see the cover story of Newsweek magazine last week?

<p>The cover story is titled, "Why TV is Good for Kids."

<p>What are we to expect from Newsweek next week?

<p>Why Soda Pop is Good for Kids.

<p>Why Sedentary Living is Good for Kids.

<p>Why Obesity is Good for Kids.

<p>Some things are good for kids.

<p>Reading is good for kids.

<p>Love and caring is good for kids.

<p>Teaching is good for kids.

<p>Running, playing basketball and baseball and tennis and swimming are good for kids.

<p>But don't try and insult us by telling us that sitting in front of a TV is good for kids.

<p>Why, against all common sense, is Newsweek going to try and convince us that television is good for kids?

<p>Well, one reason might be: Newsweek is owned by the Washington Post Company, which owns a sprawling cable company and six broadcast stations around the country.

<p>Of course, nowhere in the article does Newsweek tell us this.

<p>And how does Newsweek try and convince us that TV is good for kids?

<p>They trot out an expert, Daniel Anderson, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, who claims that TV is good for kids.

<p>But what Newsweek doesn't tell us is Anderson is a paid consultant to a variety of television networks and advertising interests.

<p>His clients include: NBC, CBS, Universal Pictures, Sony, General Mills, the Leo Burnett ad agency, Nickelodeon and the National Association of Broadcasters.

<p>The article says that TV is a good thing because kids learn from television and parents are "looking for TV to help them do a better job of raising kids."

<p>But Frank Vespe, executive director of the TV TurnOff Network (www.tvturnoff.org),  points out that the article misses a crucial
issue: the average American school child spends more time in front of the television each year -- about 1,023 hours -- than in the classroom
-- about 900 hours.

<p>"This amount of television -- more than twice what anyone thinks is a healthy amount -- has negative consequences for health, education, and family time," Vespe said.

<p>This amount of television watching actually hurts children.

<p>Vespe points to studies documenting how kids gain weight from watching TV, and that TV reinforces sex roles and stereotyping.

<p>Voracious TV-watching kids turn into voracious TV-watching adults. The average American watches four hours a day, 1460 hours a year, about two full months, 24 hours a day, every year.

<p>Newsweek did run a one-page counterpoint ("No It's Not") to its "TV Is Good for Kids" eight pager.

<p>The "No It's Not" counterarticle is written by a mom who points out that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children younger than two and a maximum of two hours a day of "screen time" -- TV, computers or videogames -- for older kids.

<p>We rang up the author of the "Why TV Is Good for Kids" article, Daniel McGinn.

<p>McGinn immediately points out that at the end of his article, he did write that the expert, Anderson, advised on a handful of television shows during their conception.

<p>"People who help create television shows get paid to do so," McGinn tells us.

<p>Well, yes, but Anderson gets paid to do much more.

<p>According to his own bio, Anderson has been paid by NBC and by General Mills to consult "on television viewing behavior."

<p>And he's been paid by the Leo Burnett ad agency to consult on "children's cognitive processing of television."

<p>That's a touch more than helping to "create television shows."

<p>We asked Newsweek's McGinn why he didn't inform his readers that Newsweek is owned by the Washington Post which owns a cable company and six broadcast news outlets.

<p>"Newsweek is owned by the Washington Post," he says. "I'm not sure what the Washington Post owns today."

<p>You mean you don't know that the Washington Post Company owns television outlets?

<p>It's right on the company's web site: WDIV in Detroit, KPRC in Houston, WPLG in Miami, WKMP in Orlando, KSAT in San Antonio and WJXT in Jacksonville.

<p>The Post also owns Cable ONE, the owner and operator of cable television systems serving subscribers across the country.

<p>Earlier, McGinn left a message on our machine saying he was willing to talk with us "at whatever length."

<p>At this point, though, McGinn decides the conversation has gone on long enough.

<p>"Who do you write for?" he asks. We tell him.

<p>"Have a great day, bud." And he hangs up.
