From a distance, an anthill looks like an inanimate mound of earth.  Yet 
when from up close, you see movement - ants busily working for the greater 
good of their ecosystem, ants who bear the brunt of hard labor, carrying 
many times their body weight in food for the colony, working in unison.

<p>From a distance, Santa Barbara looks like this anthill.  We might appear 
comfortably inert, insulated from the economic injustices which have 
plagued nearby areas like Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, but looking 
closely, we are a community in motion.

<p>The agricultural laborers, workers and pickers who sustain the local 
economy are like the ants: diligently working, yet often out of sight or 
unappreciatedly trampled underfoot.  The People's March for Economic 
Justice scheduled for Saturday, April 27 here in Santa Barbara will 
highlight the diverse groups working toward achieving a sustainable 
economy, a living wage and workplace justice in our community.  This march 
aims to show the commitment, the momentum and the ongoing winnable 
struggles which affect everyone.

<p>Among the groups involved are the United Farm Workers, the Coalition for a 
Living Wage and two groups looking to challenge the role of the University 
of California's involvement in less-than-humanitarian endeavors - the UC 
Nuclear Free Campaign and Students for a Free Tibet.

<p>Nearly fifty local groups have endorsed this march, overwhelming evidence 
that many people in Santa Barbara County are interested in economic justice 
and informed about the issues.  Yet many people still live at a distance, 
believing that our anthill is just fine as is.

<p>Student groups disagree.  Students for a Free Tibet and the student members 
belonging to the UC Nuclear Free Campaign support the local struggles for 
economic justice by challenging the UC school system's involvement with BP 
Amoco petroleum investments in Tibet and the inappropriate relationship 
between the University of California and the Department of Energy regarding 
oversight and management of the nuclear weapons research facilities and 
laboratories.

<p>Michael Coffey of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation says that "these issues 
- human rights in Tibet and the military-industrial-academic complex - 
directly affect what goes on locally in the Santa Barbara Community."  He 
continued by saying, "We must support those who sustain our local economy 
by challenging the fundamentally undemocratic policy and practice of 
overseeing nuclear weapons research and development by the largest employer 
in Santa Barbara County, UCSB."

<p>The need to de-link the University of California from the nuclear weapons 
industry is inextricably linked to the People's March for Economic 
Justice.  More than $6 billion in taxpayer dollars supports the 
relationship between UC and DoE, money which would be much more wisely 
spent on education, healthcare and social services infrastructure.  Rather 
than funding the machinery of death, we should allocate our resources 
toward promoting a better quality of life for all people.

<p>The United Farm Workers from Ventura County will be present at the march to 
explain the situation with their employer, mushroom mogul Pictsweet, owned 
by United Foods, Inc.  For nearly fourteen years the workers have tried to 
gain a contract, and in September 2000 initiated a boycott of Pictsweet 
products hoping to influence the management to come to the negotiating 
table.  The workers want safer working conditions, a raise to accommodate 
the rising cost of living, a forum for mediating conflicts on the job and 
most of all, respect.

<p>The Pictsweet workers are encouraged and excited to be participating in 
this march.

<p>"Our community is in movement," says United Farm Workers organizer Brendan 
Greene.  "We are working to change our community, to better our community 
for ourselves and our families.  We want everyone in Santa Barbara to see 
our struggles and our hard work and to become a part of our campaigns for 
justice."

<p>A living wage for Santa Barbara County residents is tremendously 
important.  UCSB instructor and Ph.D. candidate Keith Rosendal analyzed 
local data about the economic structure of our community and found that 
rents in Goleta have increased by 33% and over 20% in Santa Barbara, 
highlighting a need for affordable housing for all local residents.  He 
learned that since 1996 more than 21% of people living in Santa Barbara 
County have no health insurance, compared to the national figure of 13%, 
and that the growth of jobs in Southern California has occurred in areas 
which pay very little - in the service and agricultural sectors.  These 
statistics are a mirror held up to our faces: what kind of a society can 
accept the disparity of allocation of resources and access to important 
things like healthcare, decent wages and respect!

<p>Marches symbolize motion, movement, progress.  Our community Economic 
justice ought to be attainable for all members of our society, which will 
require support and solidarity in Santa Barbara.

<p>The power in nonviolent action is unity, diversity and recognition of the 
delicate web of interconnectedness which binds all the issues together at 
the People's March for Economic Justice.
