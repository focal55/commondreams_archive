<p>To the "man in the street", on whose support Tony Blair and George Bush ultimately 
depend, it looks like a fair enough offer. For months the US has been huffing 
and puffing, mouthing and mithering, making waves over Iraq, demanding that it 
do what Washington wants. Now, finally, it has received a simple answer: yes. 
So what does the US do? Ask for more. 
<P>It is worth recalling how this pseudo-epiphany was reached. The build-up began 
in earnest with Bush's "axis of evil" speech in January; then came his doctrine 
of "pre-emptive attack" (what security adviser Condoleezza Rice sweetly calls 
"anticipatory defense"). Then a startled world learned that "rogue states" holding 
weapons of mass destruction were more or less on the team with Osama and al-Qaida. 
That, it transpired, made them legitimate targets for America's "war on terror" 
and "regime change". 
<P>Last week, Bush turned his screw yet more fiercely. If Iraq truly wished peace, 
he hectored, it must not only agree to full, certified disarmament under UN auspices 
(and on US terms). It must also swiftly honor all the numerous obligations laid 
upon it after the Gulf war. 
<P>But Iraq's weapons remained the principal focus. Some chemical and biological 
capability is still most likely at Saddam Hussein's disposal, according to the 
final reports of the UN inspectors in 1998. He may since have developed more. 
Scarier still, hawks squawk, Iraq may be only three years, or three months, or 
who knows, three weeks away from acquiring a nuclear weapon. An image was conjured 
of the Baghdad bazaar. "Pop round next Tuesday Mr Saddam. Your package will be 
waiting." 
<P>Such angst with all this blethering did Bush and his cohorts inspire. Such 
discomfiture and war-feverish unease did they spread among European allies such 
as Blair and his party followers. What strains and stresses stole like shadows 
of the night over the deserts of the Middle East as Arab allies and foes alike 
contemplated a coming US onslaught. How greatly did they clamor and cringe, to 
the delight of the Cheneys and Rumsfelds, Wolfowitzs and Perles. One by one, slinking 
Saudis followed chapeau-chomping French into the American sheepfold. 
<P>And then, after all this hot and bother fuss, suddenly and out of the blue, 
even before General Tommy Franks, the wannabe "Stormin' Norman", has unpacked 
his Qatar camp bed, Iraq simply says "OK". To all these provocations, Baghdad 
puts a timely stopper. 
<P>Nor is there any doubting the popularity of Saddam's shift, enough to make 
the White House sick. Security council members declare themselves encouraged. 
Russia looks forward to a political settlement and an end to threats of war. China 
discerns a positive sign. Backsliding Germany's Joschka Fischer rubs it in with 
a told-you-so about the efficacy of the UN-centered, multilateral approach. Even 
in London, predictions fly suggesting that war, if it comes, has now been put 
back a year, that Bush and Blair are split over how to proceed, and that Downing 
Street will be blamed by US hardliners for steering their president up a diplomatic 
blind alley. Some Muslim countries, meanwhile, demand a lifting of sanctions. 
<P>Worse still, the no-strings nature of Iraq's riposte has plain-spoken appeal. 
And to the "man in the street", increasingly bowed, browbeaten and bamboozled 
by the government's line (as polls show) but now relieved and hopeful, it seems 
reasonable. After all, what more do these people want? 
<P>Quite a lot, actually, and the Bushmen's demands will increase rather than 
diminish as yesterday's momentary flummoxing fades. The gap between what America 
might wisely do, and what it really does, may yet grow schismatically chasmatic. 
<P>The US has a "moral obligation", says sensible Liberal Democrat Menzies Campbell, 
to take the Iraqi offer seriously and explore it fully. Will it do so? The initially 
scornful and dismissive response can be expected to harden in the days ahead into 
a firm line insisting the threat has not diminished one whit, that Iraq will be 
judged by actions, not words, and that merely "tactical" maneuvers of this sort 
have been seen before. 
<P>Far from welcoming Iraq's prima facie compliance with weapons inspections resolutions, 
the coming US emphasis will be on the several other "materially breached" UN decrees. 
And whatever Moscow says, the dogged pursuit of a new resolution authorizing a 
yet tougher line will continue apace. 
<P>Far from facilitating the inspections process, quickly agreeing a timetable 
and fixing an end point, as Iraq has previously asked, the stress now will be 
on anywhere, anytime coercion, intrusion, paramilitary enforcement, and re-extraction 
of inspectors at the first glimmer of obstruction. The public message will be 
skepticism, that anything worth finding has already been hidden, that "cheat and 
retreat" is Iraq's game, and that the military option may still be the only option. 
<P>To this end, despite yesterday's developments, the military build-up will continue, 
the ships and tanks, planes and carriers so vital to America's sense of self-worth 
will edge towards Iraq, the tone-deaf Rumsfeld's Pentagon will bang on at what 
Syria calls the drums of war and deathly ominous B52s, like so many unChristian 
soldiers marching as to war, will once more silence the hedgerows of Gloucestershire. 
Expect US pretexts for escalation, fake and insincere negotiations, and false 
horizons. 
<P>For Saddam, with every concession, the bar will be raised ever higher. Almost 
whatever he says or does, the gun will remain at his head, the trigger ever cocked 
for the commencement of a battle which Bush et al will not be denied. Despite 
a broad international consensus against it, regime change and nothing less will 
remain the ultimate objective. 
<P>And why, the "man in the street" might ask, do they appear so set on violence? 
Because Bush's misconceived, over-hyped global "war on terror" has run out of 
targets and is far from won. Because Iraq is oil-rich (the second biggest reserves) 
and the Saudis grow unreliable. Because, purely in domestic policy terms, especially 
post-Enron, this government is political roadkill. Because the administration's 
predominant, evangelical clique believes it is solo superpower America's historic 
mission (Bush says it is a "calling") to spread its universal values and rescue 
a muddled world from itself. Because the Bush family has old scores to settle 
and new elections to win. Because Bush lacks the insight and imagination to act 
differently. Because in their September 11 pain and unforgotten anger, not nearly 
enough of America's "men in the street", and in high places too, are prepared 
to say stop, pause, and consider what it is they do.</p>
