<p>Three years ago Time magazine carried an article by James Cramer, the founder 
of TheStreet.com, an online magazine fully dedicated to the worship of mammon. 
Extolling the virtues of a life dedicated to buying and selling shares from home, 
it was called "Yeah, Day Traders!" Cramer's message was simple. Forget teaching, 
forget tilling the land, forget making trucks or mending bones; instead make a 
living from speculation. There had, the article insisted, never been a better 
time "to trade for a living". 
<P>In his splendid book on the triumph of extreme capitalism*, Thomas Frank called 
1999 the summer of corporate love, and he was spot on. Just as in 1967, the promise 
was of liberation from the straight world of the past; the difference was that 
the drug of choice was not LSD but money. And the gurus of the revolution were 
not the Beatles and the Stones, but men like Cramer and James Glassman, who predicted 
that the Dow Jones industrial average would not stop at 10,000 but rise inexorably 
to 36,000. A suitable epitaph for the summer of corporate love would be John Lennon's 
for the Beatles when they split up three years after Sgt Pepper: "The dream is 
over." 
<P>Today the talk is not of when the Dow will hit 36,000 but how low it will go. 
Today, a magazine that used the headline "Yeah, Day Traders!" would be in danger 
of being torched by the small army of investors who have seen the value of their 
portfolios shrivel since the bubble burst in the spring of 2000. Today, the issue 
is whether the price of collective market insanity will be a serious global recession 
or, even worse, a full-blown slump. 
<P>There is an army of pundits out there willing to say that there is little to 
worry about. Policy makers everywhere are oozing reassurance, intoning the mantra 
that the economic vibes are good. Lawrence Lindsey, George Bush's economic adviser, 
was at it in the Financial Times yesterday, insisting that a recession in the 
US was "unlikely". 
<P>In reality, of course, nobody knows for sure what is going to happen. Financial 
analysts have their charts which are supposed to be able to predict the future 
from the past, and these now spell trouble. Economists who look at the hard economic 
data say that cheaper money and higher spending means things are getting better. 
But both presuppose that economics is a science rather than a modern form of alchemy, 
and that the practitioners in its black arts are anything more than highly-paid 
witch doctors. The only theory that is really relevant to the stock market is 
chaos theory. The recent history of the dollar is a case in point. For at least 
the past five years, the strength of the US currency has been eating into corporate 
profitability and contributing to a record trade deficit. Markets knew that the 
dollar was overvalued, but kept on buying it regardless. Over the past two months, 
the mood has changed and the dollar has fallen by 14% against the euro, breaking 
through the one-for-one parity level yesterday for the first time in more than 
two years. When will the fall be arrested? Who knows? On some estimates, the dollar 
is still 30% overvalued, but a rapid fall of that size would feed back into the 
equity markets, with foreign investors rushing for the door. 
<P>All of which explains why policymakers are a lot more concerned about the recent 
downward spasm in share prices than they are letting on. The sharp fall in American 
consumer confidence reported last Friday was a clear indication that the public 
mood has been affected by the declines on Wall Street triggered by the $3.8bn 
accounting fraud at WorldCom. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
America's central bank, is giving testimony to Congress today but his words will 
be less important than the Fed's actions when it meets next month to set interest 
rates. 
<P>Greenspan's real fear is that the US economy will become locked in a downward 
spiral in which falling share prices lead to weak consumption, which in turn puts 
pressure on company profits and - eventually - the financial system itself. Asset 
prices would collapse and corporations be forced to slash prices in order to generate 
cash flow, leading to a period of deflation in which lower interest rates failed 
to stimulate growth. It could never happen, say the optimists. In fact, it already 
has - in the world's second largest economy, Japan. There, the country has had 
four recessions since its bubble burst at the end of the 1980s. Prices are falling, 
consumers are hoarding cash; it would take but one more shove to push the banks 
over the edge into systemic crisis. Greenspan has been studying a voluminous report 
he ordered into the Japanese experience; that's how worried he is. 
<P>The best that can be hoped for is that there are no more stories of boardroom 
wrongdoing over the coming weeks, and that some better (and honest) figures from 
some of the titans of corporate America produce a rapid recovery in share prices, 
which then boosts consumer spending. This would not provide a cure for the economy's 
ills, which are caused by excessive hi-tech investment and excessive borrowing 
during the bubble years, but it would at least buy Greenspan some time. 
<P> F ar more worrying would be a continuation of the falls in share prices over 
the next couple of weeks. In those circumstances, the Fed would then come under 
strong pressure to cut interest rates at its August meeting, and would almost 
certainly bow to it. There is, however, no guarantee that it would be effective 
in restoring confidence. Why? Firstly, it would be a small cut of only 0.25 percentage 
points from the already low level of 1.75%. Secondly, it might be counter-productive, 
seen as a sign that the Fed was panicking (which it would be). Finally, the relevant 
level of interest rates is the one being paid by companies and consumers on their 
loans. These have not been coming down nearly quickly enough to prevent financial 
distress. 
<P>The underlying problem is that since the mid-1990s, share prices are up by 
200% but corporate profits - as measured by sober government statisticians rather 
than dodgy auditors - have risen by 40%. It is conceivable that Greenspan would 
have to cut, cut and cut again before Wall Street responded. Even then (and assuming 
there is no invasion of Iraq to complicate matters), there is a risk that the 
easing of policy will simply lead to a re-run of this year - a short-lived burst 
of euphoria followed by the realization that companies cannot produce the earnings 
expected of them. Greenspan and Bush would then be in an even worse quandary than 
they are now, having used up nearly all the shots in their locker. Meanwhile, 
Europe and Japan - heavily dependent on a US recovery to keep their economies 
ticking over - would be faced with the prospect of deep, prolonged recession. 
<P>If this sounds gloomy, that's because it is. It would be the most critical 
moment for the global economy since the 1930s. There would, however, be one silver 
lining: people would ask how we got into this mess in the first place. The answer 
is that policy makers, dazzled by Cramer, Glassman and their friends in the financial 
markets, deliberately removed the brake pedal from global capitalism. And, as 
any engineer knows, the brake pedal is what allows the machine to travel safely 
at speed. Without it there are only two speeds - dangerously fast and dead slow.
