<p>Only two days after President Bush's September 4th meeting with top Congressional 
officials, US forces patrolling the no-fly zones over Iraq stepped up their attacks 
on Iraqi military targets. This is happening just as reports surfaced that the 
largest US military buildup in Gulf region since the Gulf Conflict of 1991 was 
underway. The September 4th meeting itself was a watershed. Until that point at 
least two things had been ambiguous on the surface: whether the President would 
consult Congress on his war plans, and whether Bush was serious when he said he 
had not made a decision. With top Democrats indicating after the meeting that 
they could probably be persuaded to vote for war, the Bush strategy suddenly appears 
quite clear. A barrage of conflicting reports have been circulating in the media 
over the last six months, much of it known to be disinformation. And the media 
has been caught up in covering the various apparent splits over whether the US 
should 'go it alone' in invading Iraq (with no serious disagreement over whether 
or not attacking Iraq would, in itself, be a good idea). All of this served to 
distract attention away from any voices that oppose attacking Iraq at all. But 
at the same time, there has been a virtually unprecedented groundswell of action, 
organization and speaking out against the Bush administration's plans to attack 
Iraq. Tens of thousands of Americans have been organizing at the grassroots, meeting 
their congressmen and candidates, expressing deep concerns and strong opposition 
to a major attack on Iraq. 
<p>While almost overnight the Bush camp has gone from appearing divided and in 
disarray, it now appears virtually unanimous and confident that it can win over 
Congress and possibly a few allies at the UN to support a plan for war driven 
by a mix of hysteria and unsubstantiated allegations. While the Democrats are 
already indicating that they will not allow such a vote to take place before the 
election, the administration appears to be closing ranks in an attempt to rush 
a pro-war vote through Congress before it adjourns again in October, in hopes 
of making an end run around the growing opposition to war. The Republicans know 
that their Democratic opponents in the November elections will be wary about being 
seen weak on patriotism if they should dare to speak out against the war, even 
if the public is deeply divided and confused about the whole matter. It remains 
to be seen whether voters will be so distracted by foreign policy (normally a 
non-factor in elections) that they will lose sight of the stagnating and floundering 
US economy. 
<p>So if you don't want to see the US launch a massive assault against a country 
that was already 'bombed back into the stone age' eleven years ago, then you need 
to be spending every free moment you have writing letters, making phone calls, 
sending faxes and e-mails, voicing your opinion loud and clear on talk radio shows, 
in letters to the editor, any outlet you have to speak out. And take heart, all 
the facts are on your side. 
<p>First, there is simply no evidence of Iraqi government involvement in the attacks 
of September eleventh. Therefore, the Patriot Act does not provide for US military 
action against Iraq. Second, there is no evidence of Iraq having reconstituted 
its weapons of mass destruction programs. On September 7th, British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair met with President Bush and unveiled his long-awaited 'proof' that 
Iraq is reconstituting its programs. The evidence? Satellite photos showing construction 
at former weapons production sites. "What more evidence do we need?" Bush asked 
reporters. But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that the photos 
do not reveal anything to arouse suspicions of renewed weapons programs in Iraq. 
And the White House staff have already admitted that Bush's claim that a 1998 
IAEA study reported that Iraq would have nuclear weapons capability within six 
months was mistaken (the report actually "found no indication of Iraq having achieved 
its program goal of producing nuclear weapons..."). The fact that Bush and Blair's 
'evidence' was discredited within 24 hours of its revelation means we should call 
on our leaders to be on guard and call for scrutiny, deliberation and caution 
before they commit young men to war based on specious allegations or suspiciously 
convenient evidence. 
<p>But the question of whether or not Iraq possesses such weapons distracts from 
the real issue: would Iraq use them against the US or its allies? Is historical 
memory so feint these days that we have forgotten about the Cold War and deterrence? 
With upwards of 40,000 Soviet nuclear missiles pointed at the US, not one was 
fired, and that has everything to do with the threat that the US posed to the 
USSR. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz is on record as saying that it would be 
suicide for Iraq to threaten the US with weapons of mass destruction. 
<p>Launching an all-out war on Iraq would distract this nation from the real danger 
our citizens face. That danger comes from groups like Al Qaeda that have openly 
declared their intent to take the lives of American citizens and who showed on 
September 11 just how seriously they are to be taken. The Iraqi government's military 
activities can be subjected to inspections, but Al Qaeda has the elements of surprise, 
anonymity and perhaps also patience (remember the WTC attack of 1993?) on their 
side. Chasing Al Qaeda operatives down in the hills of Afghanistan and confiscating 
arms caches may slow them down in the short run, but until the US reverses policies 
that brutalize whole populations in the region, every major military action it 
undertakes there will surely make recruiting all that much easier for these terrorists, 
and thus will surely make it more dangerous for Americans to travel abroad or 
even to stay at home. In the age of weapons of mass destruction, the risks of 
war for even the world's sole superpower are incalculable. That puts the highest 
of premiums on diplomacy. The US could have inspectors back in Iraq tomorrow if 
it wanted them; all it would have to do is lay out a clear timetable for the lifting 
of the cruel embargo on Iraq. 
<p>All the debate about whether or not the US has evidence to support its pretext 
for attacking Iraq also serves to distract from the question of what the US stands 
to gain from such an invasion. And virtually everybody knows that this question 
can be answered with one word: oil. If this were Western Australia, forget it, 
we would not even be talking about it. It is only a narrow range of interests 
that will be served by an invasion of Iraq. 
<p>Will the interests of Iraqis really be served? If Karzai's shaky puppet regime 
in Afghanistan is any indication, then clearly Iraqis can expect the US to expend 
tens of billions of dollars to bomb them, and only tens of millions to help rebuild 
a post-Saddam Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq's population is concentrated in urban 
centers, where Iraq will no doubt locate its military units and where the US will 
no doubt concentrate its bombing. So the civilian death rates will likely be much 
higher and could easily rival the 75,000 to 150,000 Iraqi civilians that human 
rights groups estimated perished from the 1991 bombing. 
<p>And will the American public be served? Will we really be any safer? Will our 
troops come home sick as they did eleven years ago? And how many young men now 
in uniform will come back in body bags? 
<p>The National Network to End the War Against Iraq (NNEWAI) is asking everyone 
to call their senators and congressmen each Tuesday until the election to voice 
opposition to attacking Iraq. NNEWAI ('New Way') members will be joining other 
organizations on September 29th in Washington for a public forum and protest against 
plans to attack Iraq. The tentative plan is for an 'embassy march' to encourage 
other nations to hold fast to their opposition to the Bush war plan. On the following 
weekend, October 6th and 7th, local protests will be held across the US. And plans 
are underway for another, larger, anti-war demonstration at the steps of the Capitol 
in mid-October, before Congress adjourns.
