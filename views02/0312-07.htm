Now that the US recession is over (Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has 
pronounced it), it is worth glancing back at the 
widespread concerns of a global economic 
slowdown that prevailed just a few months ago. 
These fears turned out to be overblown, and 
there's a reason for that: the "global economy" is 
itself somewhat of an exaggeration.

<p>Last year, when the economies of the 
United States, Europe, and Japan were all slowing 
at the same time, many people took this as further 
evidence that globalization had finally put us all 
in the same economic boat. But the slowdown of 
the three major economies -- which together 
account for more than three-fourths of the world's 
output -- was, more than anything, a coincidence. 

<p>The downturn had different, mainly 
internal, causes in each of these economies. In the 
United States, it was the partial bursting of the 
stock market bubble that ended the longest 
economic expansion in our history. Europe is 
constrained primarily by the tight monetary policy 
of its central bank: it is holding short-term interest 
rates twice as high as ours, despite much higher 
unemployment there. And Japan is caught in its 
own unique deflationary slump -- with consumers 
and businesses holding back on spending -- that 
has persisted for most of the last decade.

<p>More importantly, any one of the Big 
Three economies can pull itself out of its own 
slump without help from the others. This is 
especially true for the United States, where more 
than 88 percent of the goods and services we 
produce are still sold right here at home.

<p>The larger-than-life portrayal of our global 
economic inter-connectedness is but one of 
numerous exaggerations that have come to 
dominate the discussion of globalization. Think of 
it as a marketing strategy: our political leaders, 
backed by most economists at major think tanks, 
are trying to sell a particular brand of 
globalization to an increasingly skeptical public. 
Call it "the Washington Consensus," for its place 
of origin.

<p>This brand is marketed as an inexorable 
march of progress, driven by technological 
advances in such areas as communications and 
transportation. If the majority of Americans have 
actually lost out in this process -- as economic 
research and wage data for the last quarter-century 
clearly show -- well, they will just have to adapt 
better to the "global economy." 

<p>To question the consensus is portrayed as 
futile and senseless, like opposing the weather. 
But in reality, the rules that govern global 
commerce are made by people -- mostly 
politicians. These rules can be changed so that the 
majority of people -- in the world as well as here -
- benefit from globalization. 

<p>That certainly hasn't happened yet. 
Contrary to the mythology of the global economy, 
the vast majority of low and middle-income 
countries have suffered a drastic decline in 
economic growth over the past 20 years. From 
1980-2000, the per capita income of the low and 
middle-income countries grew at less than half the 
rate of the previous two decades. This is World 
Bank data, and any economist who is literate in 
this area knows what happened -- but few are 
willing to even talk about this profound economic 
failure. They do not want to be seen as spoiling 
the overall effort to market the Washington 
Consensus.

<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, we are by 
no means out of the woods just yet, despite 
positive growth in the fourth quarter of last year 
and the current quarter's expected improvement. 
US consumers, with their debt at record levels, 
cannot continue to drive the engine of recovery by 
themselves. And there is no indication so far that 
business investment, down 9 percent from its peak 
a year ago, is coming back. Exports could help, 
but not so long as the US dollar remains over-
valued. 

<p>That leaves the government. But the bond 
markets are already anticipating that the Fed will 
raise interest rates as early as May (the Fed has 
never been all that comfortable with 
unemployment below 6 percent).

<p>And sadly, more than 60 years after 
World War II pulled this country out of the Great 
Depression, military Keynesianism is still the only 
expansionary fiscal policy that can command a 
majority among our political class. Hence the real 
economic stimulus package of the Bush 
Administration, whether calculated as such or not: 
the War Without End. It seems that globalization 
is not only area of economic debate where 
ideology has crowded out reason.
