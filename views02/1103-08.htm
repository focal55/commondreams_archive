<p>Faced with Saddam Hussein, the former teenage hit man from Tikrit, our government 
appears to feel the need to talk as tough as any Tikriti. Ari Fleischer, speaking 
from the White House briefing room, calls for "one bullet" to take care of the 
Iraqi leader; George Bush talks blithely of "taking him out"; and Tom Lantos, 
ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee, recently, according 
to Ha'aretz, assured a visiting Israeli lawmaker: "We'll be rid of the bastard 
soon enough, and in his place we'll install a pro-Western dictator, who will be 
good for us and for you."
<p> Such violent sentiments are not necessarily a reaction to Hussein's well-documented 
cruelty. We can, after all, be understanding about such foibles among our friends. 
The gassing of the Kurds was greeted with barely more than a bleat of protest 
from Washington, as was his earlier use of chemical weapons in the war with Iran, 
but we were allies then. It took Hussein's apparent bid for control of the world 
oil market by invading Kuwait to turn him into "Hitler," capable, as was faithfully 
reported in the propaganda buildup to the last Gulf War, of tossing Kuwaiti babies 
out of hospital incubators. That myth, dreamed up by the PR firm Hill and Knowlton, 
was exposed soon after it had served its purpose. Others, such as the notion that 
Hussein is both ready and able to unleash some super-weapon on the United States, 
have proved more enduring.
<p> Now more than ever, myth looms larger than reality when it comes to Iraq, 
which may be why Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan has suggested that the 
dispute be settled in an OK Corral shootout between Bush and Hussein, flanked 
by their respective veeps and umpired by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
<p> In the prologue to "Saddam: King of Terror," Con Coughlin strikes a no less 
mythic note, citing as part of the indictment against the Iraqi leader his links 
to Osama bin Laden and an alleged meeting in Prague between hijacker Mohamed Atta 
and an Iraqi intelligence officer, a story now effectively discredited by the 
Czech intelligence service that spread it in the first place. Once past the obligatory 
threat-mongering, however, Coughlin, a British journalist well-versed in Middle 
Eastern affairs, deploys more credible sources, especially the reminiscences of 
former Baathists who once worked closely with Hussein, to present an engrossing 
account of how this semi-educated peasant boy advanced to power through the bloodstained 
shoals of Iraqi revolutionary politics.
<p> While accounts of his subject's brutality and ruthlessness are familiar, though 
no less chilling for that, Coughlin reminds us that Hussein did not achieve his 
eminence through terror alone. Not only was he extremely skillful politically 
-- steadily accumulating power through the 1970s while maintaining a low profile 
in the shadow of his cousin, President Ahmad Hassan Bakr -- he also displayed 
considerable constructive talents as an administrator.
<p> Iraqi leaders, for example, had long chafed at the control of the country's 
oil resources by the cartel of foreign oil corporations that made up the Iraq 
Petroleum Co. Efforts by various regimes to alter this colonial relationship by 
taking over those oilfields that the IPC refused to develop had proved fruitless: 
Among other disciplinary measures, the international oil companies simply refused 
to supply oil to any country that bought oil directly from the Iraqi government 
rather than from the IPC.
<p> Beginning in 1971, Hussein (then deputy to Bakr but already the key power 
in the country), advised by the gifted oil minister Murtada Hadithi, took the 
initiative in outmaneuvering the cartel. After first securing the Soviet Union 
as a great-power sponsor (despite a career built on persecuting Communists), he 
induced the French to break ranks with the consortium by promising them lucrative 
contracts and discounted oil prices. The scheme worked, finally allowing Iraq 
unfettered access to its own fabulous oil riches. It was, says Coughlin, "the 
single most revolutionary event to take place in Iraq since its establishment" 
-- one which has doubtless not been forgotten or forgiven by the oil companies 
-- generating a tidal wave of cash, which the Baath used "to turn the country 
into a modern state, and to raise the living standards of ordinary Iraqis."
<p> Carrying out this vast undertaking required skilled assistance. Hussein has 
always drawn a distinction between "those who are loyal" and "those who are expert," 
the former being those very few trusted individuals -- first and foremost his 
immediate family -- through whom he maintains his grip on power. When it comes 
to experts, however, Hussein always displayed an eager eye for, as one former 
apparatchik recalls, "young people with good qualifications who were intelligent 
and courageous." Even today, anyone who encounters his officials -- such as oil 
minister Amer Rashid; Amir Sadi, chief negotiator on the weapon inspection issue; 
or Foreign Minister Naji Sabri -- can see that Hussein is served by an impressively 
accomplished team. Of course, as the charming Sabri could explain, competence 
does not guarantee a long life in Hussein's Baghdad. His cousin was Hadithi, the 
former oil minister who later became ambassador to Moscow. Hadithi was summoned 
home soon after Hussein took supreme power in 1979 and executed (perhaps because 
the newly enthroned leader did not want anyone around sharing credit for the oil 
coup). Sabri's brother was killed as well, and rumor has it that Sabri himself 
was on the list until an attentive Hussein struck it off with the words "not him, 
he can be useful."
<p> Kenneth M. Pollack's purpose in "The Threatening Storm" is less to tell a 
well-rounded story than to argue the case, as declared in his subtitle, for invading 
Iraq, displacing Hussein and building a new Iraq. Pollack, a former CIA analyst 
and National Security Council staffer in the Clinton administration, argues that 
such action is imperative because Hussein is not only a bloodthirsty tyrant but 
a really stupid one to boot, prone to irrational gambles such as the attack on 
the Kurds in 1974 as well as the attacks on Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. Such 
reckless adventurism, Pollack insists, is a threat to us because Hussein is on 
the point of acquiring nuclear weapons. Therefore, he and every aspect of his 
regime must be eliminated as quickly as possible. This martial intervention will 
ultimately reverse anti-Americanism in the Arab world once the U.S. has built 
a "strong, prosperous, and inclusive new Iraqi state."
<p> Because so much of the "debate" over war with Iraq has barely risen above 
the level of sloganeering, Pollack's considered, empirical style and intellectually 
rigorous tone is likely to strike a chord with many undecided observers. Each 
stage in his argument comes buttressed with well-footnoted facts and sources (albeit 
secondary and mostly non-Iraqi). Still, this is probably the best presentation 
of their case that the war party can hope for, especially because Pollack takes 
a hardheaded approach to various postulated alternatives to a full-scale land 
invasion, such as a bombing campaign &#224; la Kosovo or a sponsored assault by 
the Iraqi opposition with U.S. air support, along the lines of the recent Afghan 
campaign. He is surely right in deriding these latter notions, although I think 
he has been a little naive about the opposition-based variant, which was most 
likely crafted by the opposition leader Ahmed Chalabi with the express design 
of drawing the United States into a full-scale land war with Iraq.
<p> As with any work of advocacy, facts and viewpoints inconvenient to the basic 
thesis sometimes get short shrift. His muddled account of Hussein's dealings with 
the Kurds in the mid-'70s -- actually a masterful display of cunning by "Mr. Deputy" 
that crushed the threat of Kurdish separatism for a generation -- may be due to 
simple ignorance. However, though he glosses over or fails to mention them, he 
must surely be aware of the various covert U.S. interventions in Iraqi affairs, 
including the CIA-supported 1963 coup that first put Hussein's Baath Party in 
power, or the Carter administration's encouraging support for Hussein's attack 
on Iran in 1980. He does concedes that the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, 
might have led Hussein to believe he had a green light to attack Kuwait, but he 
discounts the significance of the encounter.
<p> Similarly, Pollack refers delicately to Israel's "purported" nuclear arsenal. 
This might be dismissed as a mere quibble, save that the argument of his book 
-- the case for invading Iraq and occupying Iraq -- rests on the assumption that 
a dangerously reckless Hussein is about to have the bomb, with no "purported" 
about it. It is this threat alone -- biological and chemical weapons are not, 
he persuasively suggests, instruments of mass destruction because they are ineffective 
or at least unpredictable -- that justifies war.
<p> In late 1998, when the last United Nations weapon inspection mission ended 
in debacle and a rain of American bombs, the inspectors concerned with the Iraqi 
nuclear program were fully satisfied that the program was dead and buried. One 
U.S. official supervising the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
the institution charged with Iraqi nuclear disarmament, said to me at the time, 
"The United States pushes the IAEA to find little discrepancies in Iraq's nuclear 
accounting so that the file can be kept open, but short of lobotomizing or killing 
all the Iraqi nuclear scientists, the Iraqi nuclear program is finished. We have 
closed down all their nuclear facilities and activities." And in its October 1998 
report to the U.N., the IAEA itself stated, "There are no indications that there 
remains in Iraq any physical capability for the production of weapon-usable nuclear 
material of any practical significance."
<p> Such assessments do not find favor with Pollack, who regards Hussein's acquisition 
of nuclear weapons as "probably inevitable." His major source for this conclusion 
appears to be an exiled Iraqi nuclear physicist, Khidhir Hamza, who is described 
without qualification as "the former head of Iraq's nuclear weapons program." 
Hamza, who defected in 1994, claims that Hussein will most likely be in possession 
of three nuclear weapons by 2005 (though occasionally he amends that to "a bomb" 
within "months"). This individual is furthermore a key source for the suggestion 
that Hussein planned to fire a nuclear warhead, should he have had one available 
in time, at Tel Aviv during the Gulf War, thus inviting retaliatory immolation 
from Israel. If true, this certainly bolsters the case for Hussein's being impermissibly 
reckless.
<p> However, not everyone takes Hamza at his own estimation as "Saddam's bombmaker." 
In his forceful debunking of the Iraqi threat, former senior weapon inspector 
Scott Ritter states flatly in "War on Iraq," that Hamza "wasn't a designer and 
he certainly wasn't head of the program.... &#91;He&#93; is not who he says he 
is." David Albright, a Washington-based expert on nuclear proliferation who helped 
give Hamza initial credibility, recently claimed that Hamza exaggerated his own 
importance in the Iraqi program and recycled information he had picked up from 
the press, including specious revelations about biological and chemical weapons, 
as his own firsthand knowledge. Despite such reservations, Hamza still finds a 
respectful hearing among journalists and Congress, despite the lack of confirmation 
from other sources. It is telling that, while the United States detected a North 
Korean uranium enrichment program in its early stages, the administration has 
been unable, despite huge effort, to uncover hard evidence -- which it would quite 
certainly broadcast -- of any similar Iraqi activity.
<p> Ritter, meanwhile, a hero among the hawks, is now vilified, when he is not 
ignored, because of his assertions, backed up by detailed information from his 
days as a star weapon inspector, that the former U.N. inspection effort effectively 
destroyed all Hussein's weapons of mass destruction as well as his means for constructing 
them. The very fact of Ritter's relative obscurity nowadays, compared to people 
with more palatable messages, such as Hamza, points to the lack of any real debate 
on the official justifications for the proposed invasion.
<p> But then, who needs justifications? In December 1989, the U.S. attacked Panama 
on the flimsiest of pretexts and overthrew its government, killing more than 300 
Panamanians in the process. The invasion was officially code-named "Operation 
Just Cause." But, inside the Pentagon, cynics dubbed it "Operation Just Because." 
As a former defense official said to me recently, "we invaded Panama just because 
it was there and we could."
<p> Perhaps the same will be said of Iraq.
