<p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's pleading with the United States to "be patient," 
and give inspectors a chance do their work in Iraq before going to war is the 
latest sign of the growing gulf between Washington and the rest of the world on 
this issue. Having succeeded in the first phase of their war plan -- using Iraq 
to win both houses of Congress by displacing other issues in the election -- the 
Bush Administration's strategists are marching forward with phase two: making 
war inevitable. 
<p>The UN Security Council's unanimous 15-0 vote on a resolution authorizing new 
weapons inspections was widely seen here as a big victory for President Bush, 
but that was mostly because of bad reporting by the media. In truth, the administration 
got a unanimous vote by compromising on a key issue: France and Russia, as well 
as other governments, wanted an agreement that no military action against Iraq 
would be authorized without a second debate and vote in the Security Council. 
<p>The resolution that passed is ambiguous, but it is clear that Washington assured 
the others that this resolution did not authorize military action if the inspections 
failed. 
<p>According to Newsweek, both Powell and Bush assured France "that Washington 
would allow a genuine Security Council debate in the event that chief U.N. inspector 
Hans Blix reports Iraqi defiance or deceit." 
<p>The Russians got the same impression: "In the accepted resolution it is clearly 
stated that, in the event of problems, the members of the security council will 
gather to look at the situation as it stands and decide on further action," said 
Russian deputy foreign minister Yuri Fedotov. 
<p>But the problem is not just that President Bush could ignore the UN Security 
Council and go to war without their approval. A more likely scenario is that the 
Security Council will cave to U.S. pressure in the weeks and months ahead. Americans 
who have framed their opposition to the war as against "unilateral action" by 
the United States could very well regret that stance. 
<p>The reality is that the Security Council is composed of 15 countries, with 
five having a permanent seat and a veto -- and not the entire United Nations. 
And sadly, most of these 14 governments do not represent their people any more 
than the Bush Administration represents Americans. In Britain, opposition to the 
war has run as high as 71 percent, and 38 percent of those polled agreed with 
the statement that Prime Minister Tony Blair is "George W. Bush's poodle." But 
Mr. Blair will continue to bark, sit up, and beg at Washington's command. And 
we cannot realistically count on any of the others to stand up to the world's 
only super-power when push comes to shove. 
<p>Dick Cheney has a vision of the future, a decades-long crusade in which "terrorism" 
replaces communism as the pretext for using force and violence to impose Washington's 
will on the rest of the world. Having failed to show any link between Iraq and 
terrorism, the Bush Administration now prepares for a war that can be expected 
to kill tens of thousands of people -- mostly civilians, including children and 
the elderly. If the war leaves no stable government in its wake -- as in Afghanistan 
-- it can simply move on to the next confrontation, perhaps with North Korea. 
If the war provokes terrorist attacks against Americans, as it probably will, 
this is an added bonus for the Bush Administration, as it will be used to justify 
further military spending and adventures. 
<p>These people have nothing to offer American public -- there is a limited political 
base for repealing taxes on the rich -- and seem to have concluded that war and 
security issues offer their best hope to stay in power through the next election 
cycle. 
<p>Their main opposition at present comes from the millions of people who have 
demonstrated against the war -- in such disparate cities as Florence, Rome, London, 
Washington, Toronto, Tokyo, San Francisco and San Juan. 
<p>Most of the world is against this war, and sees through the various pretexts 
offered by the Bush administration. But their leaders have failed them. For now, 
democracy -- such as it exists -- is truly in the streets.</p>
