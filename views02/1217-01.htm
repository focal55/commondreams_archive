<p>Remember when President Bush said he was going to bring honor and integrity 
back to the Oval Office, implying, of course, that the credibility of the executive 
branch had been undermined by his predecessor, affectionately known in GOP circles 
as "Slick Willie"?</p>
<p>Recall with me the words of No. 43's favorite political philosopher: "Ye shall 
know them by their fruits."</p>
<p>It's unfair to make ultimate judgments about shrubs based on the bearing of 
questionable pieces of fruit, but for those skeptical of political rhetoric it 
does raise serious concern when a man of integrity appoints Henry Kissinger -- 
a guy with a reputation as an international war criminal -- to chair what is perhaps 
the most important federal commission ever assembled to investigate national security. 
</p>
<p>I guess honor and integrity took it on the chin when the good Dr. Kissinger 
resigned from the post the other day.</p>
<p>Sure, if the head of the Nevada boxing commission appointed Don King as chairman 
of a task force investigating corruption in professional pugilism, it doesn't 
mean he's a bad guy, right?</p>
<p>I mean, who can better infiltrate the murky underworld of prize-fighting promotion 
than King? Who cares if it doesn't inspire public confidence?</p>
<p>So if the Kissinger appointment didn't convince you that Bush is dead serious 
about restoring honor and integrity to the Oval Office, the recent naming of Elliot 
Abrams as Condoleezza Rice's top aide in charge of Middle Eastern affairs ought 
to make it a bit clearer.</p>
<p>Abrams is most famous for the perjury he committed as assistant secretary of 
state for Inter-American Affairs when he testified before Congress during the 
Iran-Contra hearings.</p>
<p>In October 1991, rather than stand trial for feloniously evading the truth, 
Abrams pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of withholding information from 
Congress. On Nov. 5, 1991, he was sentenced to two years probation and community 
service. He never completed his sentence because in the final days of No. 41's 
administration he was given a presidential pardon.</p>
<p>So what does someone who played a significant part in illegal arms dealing 
and a high-level cover-up do after leaving government service? Go to work as the 
president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, of course -- a position Abrams 
was appointed to in July 1996.</p>
<p>Abrams' defenders (like Kissinger supporters) argue that he is a very "competent" 
diplomat; an intellectual with impressive credentials.</p>
<p>Abrams' credentials are impressive indeed. A Harvard grad with a master's degree 
in international relations from the London School of Economics, he started his 
diplomatic career as assistant secretary of state for international organizations, 
becoming the youngest person ever to rise to the ranks of assistant secretary 
of state. An upcoming star, Abrams was dubbed by colleagues "the king of Latin 
America."</p>
<p>Investigative journalist David Harris' book "Shooting the Moon: The True Story 
of An American Manhunt" provides lots of insider details about Abrams' diplomatic 
career south of the border.</p>
<p>During his State Department tenure, after defending Panamanian dictator Manuel 
Noriega on behalf of former CIA director George Casey, Abrams flip-flopped when 
Bush decided to go after the general. </p>
<p>In fact, Abrams went so far as to draft plans to invade Panama. The plan was 
to use a "surgical strike" deploying commando troops armed with extradition papers 
and the backing of the world's most powerful military.</p>
<p>"When news of this plan eventually reached the Department of Defense, the reviews 
were unanimous," Harris writes. " 'Off the wall,' 'cockamamie,' 'comic strip,' 
'sloppy' and simply 'bull (expletive)' were perhaps the nicest things said about 
it there."</p>
<p>Gen. Fred Woerner described Abrams' plan as a "hare-brained scheme ordered 
into execution before anyone had any time or inclination to work out the details."</p>
<p>Typical of "chicken hawks," Abrams response was that the military brass was 
made up of a bunch of "wimps."</p>
<p>Harris relates one particular strategy meeting in which former Joint Chiefs 
of Staff Adm. William Crowe rebuked Abrams, saying: "There was no such thing as 
a 'surgical strike.' . . All military operations are by definition messy. Only 
someone who had never been involved in one could imagine otherwise." </p>
<p>"As a military man" Crowe was "quite frankly, frightened by such civilian fantasies 
about military action."</p>
<p>The retired admiral told an acquaintance that Abrams was little more than a 
"fanatic," Harris reports. "Even years later, the chairman (Crowe) still professed 
to be mystified at how the secretary of state. . . could delegate Latin America 
to the likes of this zealot of an assistant secretary."</p>
<p>We need a war hawk "fanatic" in charge of Middle East relations like we need 
another terrorist attack, which we just might get with such "zealots" as Abrams 
back in the saddle.</p>
