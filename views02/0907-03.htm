<p>Over the last year I've made a couple of firm predictions. The first was that 
sooner or later George Bush would launch a war to topple Saddam Hussein; the second 
was that the American people would regain their sense of balance in the aftermath 
of the 11 September bombings &#150; i.e. the country of the middle ground would 
reassert itself. The question now is whether the latter development &#150; for 
it has come to pass &#150; will cancel out the possibility of the first. Will 
the return to the center ground of the majority of American public opinion make 
it impossible for George Bush to rally domestic support for his plans to oust 
Saddam?</p>
<p>A headline in yesterday's <i>Washington Post</i> spoke the truth when it declared: 
"Bush Faces Daunting Task in Building Public Support." It did not say "impossible 
task", but merely pointed to the danger of attacking Saddam when only 37 per cent 
of poll respondents believe Bush has clearly explained his rationale for a war 
with Iraq. If you are about to commit vast numbers of troops with a risk of mass 
casualties and the wholesale destabilization of the Middle East, then the least 
people deserve is an explanation.</p>
<p>Thus has the doctrine of pre-emptive action, so passionately urged by the locker-room 
tendency on the right, come unstuck. The likes of Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz 
have been shown to be fearfully out of touch with public sentiment. Not so the 
worried congressmen and senators who have been besieged with letters, e-mails 
and calls from constituents. Across America there is an audible shout of "wait 
a minute". Set aside the so-called Vietnam syndrome, foreign wars have never been 
intrinsically popular in the US.</p>
<p>Over the last decade the real crisis in international affairs has not been 
domineering Yankee power but the struggle to make America engage with the rest 
of the world. In Bill Clinton we saw an instinctively internationalist president 
who needed to be continually wary of any public perception that he was too busy 
with "abroad". There is big irony here; it was the Republican right in particular 
that encouraged isolationist drift but that now finds itself unable, for the time, 
to convince Americans that it should send their children to fight in the Middle 
East.</p>
<p>Messrs Perle and Wolfowitz would argue that this time it is very different. 
This is no Bosnia or Rwanda or Somalia, no appeal to humanitarian instincts, but 
a situation in which the national interests of the US are directly threatened. 
Why then do a majority of Americans seem unconvinced of the urgency of the situation? 
Part of the truth is that President Bush has made little attempt to make a compelling 
case for war. More specifically he has failed to link 11 September and the horror 
it represented with Saddam Hussein. People want to know just how Iraq threatens 
their home town.</p>
<p>There was an assumption that in the climate of moral outrage that followed 
11 September, Mr Bush's long-standing desire to get rid of Saddam would have wide 
support. Also what appeared to be a relatively uncomplicated victory in Afghanistan 
emboldened the hawks in the White House. The current crisis in "liberated" Afghanistan 
should tell Mr Bush that the line between confidence and hubris can be perilously 
close.</p>
<p>I expect that when Mr Bush does present his evidence it will lay out much that 
we already know. We will be given details of Saddam's chemical and biological 
weapons capacity. There will be evidence, too, of his attempt to re-launch a nuclear 
weapons program, and finally &#150; but critically in terms of public opinion 
&#150; there will be a dossier on Saddam's links to al-Qa'ida. What none of us 
can tell until we see the information is whether the intelligence is speculative 
or solid. Even if the intelligence is less than overwhelming in relation to al-Qa'ida, 
Mr Bush may win grudging backing for his war. But grudging backing is as bad as 
no backing if the war starts go wrong.</p>
<p>The assumption that Saddam's army will simply fold as it did during the last 
Gulf War may turn out to be wrong-headed. The Iraqi leader never committed his 
best troops to battle, and when the Allied forces stormed into Kuwait and Iraq 
during Operation Desert Storm they faced waves of miserable conscripts. The real 
fighting forces were held back to deal with the internal war against the Shia 
and the Kurds, who, as Saddam anticipated, rose in rebellion when the regime seemed 
threatened.</p>
<p>During the last Gulf War, Saddam continually underestimated the determination 
of the Allies to launch an invasion. He did so largely on the basis that he believed 
the coalition would fall apart as evidence grew of civilian casualties from the 
air campaign. This time around he will calculate that public opinion in the US 
and Britain will either forestall an attack, or revolt when the military and civilian 
cost becomes too high. Saddam may well be willing to allow a war to start in the 
belief that it will collapse from political pressures well before US armour ever 
reaches the gates of Baghdad. Thus he has little incentive to cave in now to what 
are likely to be very tough demands on weapons inspections. If Saddam is convinced 
that the rest of the world is opposed to war and that the US and Britain are isolated, 
he will play tough and hope to humiliate Bush before a shot is fired. But it is 
at this point that American public opinion could swing in behind the President 
and the countdown to war will have begun.</p>
<p>The list of what-ifs that attend any war scenario is scary. Mr Blair senses 
this more acutely than his American counterpart, if only because he is more inclined 
to hear the advice of his own diplomats and intelligence people. Thus when he 
arrives in Camp David today he will surely be asking how Mr Bush proposes to deal 
with the prospect of large-scale casualties if Saddam's &eacute;lite forces make 
a stand in the cities. How will the US respond if Saddam deploys chemical and 
biological weapons against Allied forces and against the Israelis? And what does 
he plan to do for Iraq after Saddam is ousted? Iraq is a country of different 
nations &#150; Sunni, Shia and Kurd &#150; and could easily slide into Yugoslavia-style 
anarchy. Mr Bush needs to say whether he plans to turn Iraq into an international 
protectorate with thousands of Allied troops patrolling the area for years into 
the future.</p>
<p>But most of all Mr Bush needs to make a compelling case to his own people, 
and the rest of the world, for going to war in the first place. So expect to see 
a big public relations campaign to shock the American people into supporting war, 
with or without wide international support, and expect a sudden increase in the 
tempo of American efforts to try and win Arab support by pressing Ariel Sharon 
to talk to the Palestinians. It's hard to believe there will be any meaningful 
dialogue, and the best Bush can expect is a lowering of anti-war rhetoric from 
Arab leaders. Also expect Saddam to give a little but not enough and... expect 
war this winter.</p>
