<p>Writing just hours before the US election, one columnist for the London based Guardian commented that “a respectable performance by Republicans tonight - maintaining, say, their narrow hold over the House of Representatives even when the economy is sputtering - would be seen as an enormous vindication of a man who won fewer votes in the 2000 election than his Democratic opponent and was only installed in the White House thanks to five members of the US Supreme Court. From fending off questions about the legitimacy of his presidency, Bush would have become one of only three presidents not to lose House seats in a midterm election.” That Bush and the Republicans were able to surpass even these goals loudly proclaims not only Republican success but a Democratic debacle.  The tragic death of Paul Wellstone late last month might almost serve as a metaphor for the state of the Party.  Wellstone often described himself as representing the democratic wing of the Democratic Party. That wing is moribund. Without its inspiration, the party will be fortunate to survive.   

<p>Some commentators attribute the Democrats’ defeat to “wag the dog”: the President 
distracted the electorate with war talk. Yet unlike the days following September 
11, 2002, Americans are more reluctant than the President to plunge into war. 
<p>An election focused on economics couldn’t hurt Republicans when their Democratic 
opponents could hardly be viewed as an alternative. In a few states—including 
Maine-- individual Democrats did offer decidedly more progressive perspectives 
on taxes, prescription drugs, and corporate accountability. But the ability of 
some genuinely progressive Democrats to score with their messages is limited by 
the skill of the Republican response and by the confusion and timidity of their 
own party leaders. 
<p>Republicans have become adept at portraying themselves as opponents of corporate fraud, high prescription drug prices, and environmental pollution. Though the specifics of their programs are very different, I am impressed by how many Republicans around the country come off as flaming liberals in their commercials. If all I knew about George Pataki were his political ads, I would think he was a Green social democrat.

 

<p>In an age driven by sound bites, candidates have few opportunities to establish 
differences from their opponents. Their cause is better served when national parties 
articulate the stakes. Democrats enjoyed control of the US Senate. Though they 
could not enact any legislation, leaders and committee chairs could have used 
the last year to establish an alternative agenda. Yet to do so would entail breaks 
with the Clinton past. 
<p>Today’s sagging economy is one legacy of bipartisan ineptitude.  The collapse of the tech- driven stock market bubble was foreseen—not only by some left economists but even by such establishment figures as Lawrence Lindsay. But a Lindsay suggestion that the Fed impose tougher margin requirements to dampen stock market speculation was rejected by Alan Greenspan (an icon of both parties) and never accepted by the Clinton Administration. That Administration embraced a broad package of financial deregulation that did as much to encourage excesses on Wall Street as any of the Bush Administration’s sins of omission or commission. 

 

<p>After Bush’s election, national Democrats continued to squander their opportunities. 
Nation columnist William Greider comments: “Democrats like to wail about Bush's 
$1.3 trillion tax cut but forget that Daschle's opening offer was $900 billion. 
He rushed through the bailout for airlines (his wife was a lead lobbyist) and 
left out the workers. The measure expanding unemployment benefits was hailed as 
a great Democratic victory, but the bill included $43 billion in new business 
tax breaks, compared with $8.5 billion for the millions of jobless.” DC Democrats 
have no public identity as the party that would provide relief for victims of 
trade policy or offer fiscal assistance to struggling state governments. 
<p>Democratic leaders argue that the day has passed for pro-active government, 
especially more spending. Yet historically in tough times, progressive Democrats, 
both prodded by and sometimes providing leadership for grass roots groups, have 
shown that government can work for ordinary citizens. Broad based, publicly funded 
initiatives, such as Social Security, the GI bill, and Medicare, soon became staples 
of American life. They achieved their popularity because they were efficient, 
comprehensive, and laid a solid foundation for private sector growth. 
<p>Today, a progressive Democratic leadership would point out that Republican 
proposals for means tested prescription drug programs funneled through the private 
sector will be both inefficient and intrusive. Means testing always involves continual 
snooping into the private lives of potential recipients. Corporate providers of 
health care services too often “compete” by devising elaborate ways to focus enrollment 
on the healthy. When competition takes that form, even conservative governments 
eventually must devise complicated regulations. 
<p>Poverty and disease, as Wellstone so eloquently argued on many occasions, are fought in the least intrusive and most effective ways by establishing a sound safety net of fair wages and education and health care for all.  Paul Wellstone’s greatness lay in his willingness to be out front on such issues as jobs and fair wages for all, defense of family farms, and universal healthcare even when these concerns were scorned by elite opinion. 

 

<p>I recently discussed Wellstone academic background with Peter Bachrach, a distinguished Temple University political theorist now retired to Southwest Harbor. Peter’s ground breaking work in the sixties taught my generation about the subtle ways institutional and cultural forces exclude some voices even in formally democratic societies. 

 

<p>When Wellstone came up for tenure at Carleton College, the administration tried 
to deny him promotion. But widespread campus opposition forced administrators 
to initiate an outside evaluation of the professor by a distinguished visiting 
team (including Peter). That team’s report, endorsing his teaching and scholarship, 
forced the administration to relent. Peter commented that Wellstone’s sin was 
to encourage students to do broad, open- ended interviews with impoverished local 
farmers about their grievances and political goals. The Administration feared 
the antagonism and controversy such interviews might stir up. 
<p>Leadership in Washington today consists of focus groups and carefully orchestrated polls. It is primarily about packaging party funders’ goals and concerns.  It is not about forcefully articulating ends and objectives that will engage and serve the broad middle and working class. 

 

<p>The anguished response to Wellstone’s death from many grass roots organizations 
from Maine to California stands in contrast to an election where most Americans 
found little reason even to vote. There is a lesson for the opposition party—if 
it ever hopes to move beyond irrelevance.
