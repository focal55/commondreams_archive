            The art of the deal is a media dream: Savvy achievers get to the
top.
Guile and artifice -- even outright deception -- may well be part of the
game, but there's nothing like success. One way or another, money and
centralized power end up calling the tunes. Or so the media script often
goes.

<p>From its beginnings a half-century ago, the Pacifica radio network
set out to be quite different. Listeners tuned in for something else --
a
much more inclusive embrace of human creativity and political dissent.
Like most endeavors, there were failures and crises along the way. But
even with Pacifica's tumultuous history, the last three years have been
times of extraordinary upheaval.

<p>Two words -- "censorship" and "democracy" -- summarize much of what
has been at stake in the national battle over Pacifica.

<p>Now, some very good news: Democracy is winning.

<p>As the owner of noncommercial radio stations based in five
metropolitan areas -- San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, New York and
Washington -- the nonprofit Pacifica Foundation operates with a national
board of directors. During the 1990s, a succession of power grabs
enabled
a board majority to emerge with ill-disguised contempt for the
progressive
principles and grassroots innovation that had long enlivened the
Pacifica
airwaves.

<p>In 1999, turmoil reached a boiling point at the Pacifica station
headquartered in Berkeley, Calif. -- the nation's oldest
listener-sponsored radio outlet, KPFA. Long-simmering conflicts erupted
after Pacifica's national management tried to prevent KPFA from airing
news reports about firings at the station.

<p>People at KPFA refused to knuckle under. They resisted in ways that
journalists and activists have resisted for hundreds of years -- by
speaking out and by organizing. Apparently baffled that so many
employees
would take principled positions at the risk of losing their jobs, the
Pacifica management called in police, even ordering the arrest of
longtime
reporters in the KPFA newsroom.
<p>During a lockout that lasted several weeks, the outpouring of
support
for KPFA included a series of large demonstrations. One afternoon, more
than 10,000 people marched by the boarded-up station. Pacifica
management
felt compelled to relent. The station reopened.

<p>The Pacifica picture turned bleaker at the end of 2000 when a
"Christmas coup" at WBAI in New York City resulted in the firing and
banning of dozens of longtime staffers and programmers. Opponents of the
crackdown mobilized to resist the takeover while the station's new
management retaliated against critical voices. Producers for Pacifica's
hard-hitting "Democracy Now" program, the most popular in the network's
history, were harassed until they moved out of the WBAI studios. At that
point, the Pacifica-owned stations -- except for KPFA in Berkeley --
stopped broadcasting the program.

<p>At KPFK in Los Angeles, KPFT in Houston, WPFW in Washington and
WBAI,
station managers went along with a national Pacifica regime eager to
censor criticism of their own censorial policies. Hundreds of program
hosts and other volunteers were purged from the four stations because
they
refused to remain silent about the suppression.

<p>In contrast to the self-selecting power consolidation by Pacifica's
board majority, KPFA moved ahead with a democratizing process that
initiated regular elections -- so that thousands of supporters, as
members
of listener-funded KPFA Radio, could vote for a "local advisory board"
to
represent them.

<p>For years, the corporate-minded new regime atop Pacifica had a grip
on the network. Along the way, it was sometimes grim to see the
responses
from left-leaning institutions that had for decades been among key
constituencies of the Pacifica network. Some accommodated themselves to
the network's new regime.

<p>But a lot of other organizations protested the new censorship and
thereby risked being frozen off Pacifica's airwaves. Nationwide, dozens
of
community radio stations helped by condemning Pacifica actions and
boycotting its news show. Across the nation, countless listeners became
media activists as they devoted enormous amounts of time and energy to a
movement aimed at recreating Pacifica as an unabashedly progressive
grassroots network.

<p>Because of such efforts, ranging from lawsuits and picket lines to
boycotts and public education campaigns, the pressure became too much
for
the corporate-minded majority on the Pacifica national board. In late
December, a legal settlement reconstituted the board. And now, for the
first time in many years, the board's majority is committed to
progressive
principles.

<p>Many challenges are ahead. The ousted regime left the network with
massive debt, largely due to sky-high bills from law firms, security
services and public-relations outfits. Managers who've been in place at
four Pacifica stations have clear records of censorship that suited the
network's former board majority. As those managers update their resumes
and look for jobs elsewhere, they can boast of extensive experience at
opportunism.

<p>For understandable reasons, many people are cynical about media
these
days. But we shouldn't succumb to defeatism. "Democratic media" is not
necessarily an oxymoron.
