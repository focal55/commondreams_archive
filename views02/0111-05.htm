            The Bush Administration's entanglement with ENRON is beginning to
unravel as
it finally admits that Enron executives entered the White House six
times
last year to secretly plan the Administration's energy policy with
Vice-President Cheney before the collapse of the Texas-based energy
giant.
Meanwhile, even more trouble for our
former-Texas-oil-man-turned-President
is brewing with reports that unveil UNOCAL, another big energy company,
for
being in bed with the Taliban, along with the U.S. government in a
major,
continuing effort to construct pipelines through Afghanistan from the
petroleum-rich Caspian Basin in Central Asia.  Beneath their burkas,
UNOCAL
is being exposed for giving the five star treatment to Taliban Mullahs
in
the Lone Star State in 1997.  The "evil-ones" were also invited to meet
with
U.S. government officials in Washington, D.C.

<p>According to a December 17, 1997 article in the British paper, The
Telegraph, headlined, "Oil barons court Taliban in Texas,"  the Taliban
was
about to sign a "£2 billion contract with an American oil company to
build a
pipeline across the war-torn country. ... The Islamic warriors appear to
have been persuaded to close the deal, not through delicate negotiation
but
by old-fashioned Texan hospitality. ...  Dressed in traditional salwar
khameez,Afghan waistcoats and loose, black turbans, the high-ranking
delegation was given VIP treatment during the four-day stay."

<p>At the same time, U.S. government documents reveal that the Taliban were
harboring  Osama bin Laden as their "guest" since June 1996.  By then,
bin
Laden had:  been expelled by Sudan in early 1996 in response to US
insistence and the threat of UN sanctions; publicly declared war against
the
U.S. on or about August 23, 1996; pronounced the bombings in Riyadh and
at
Khobar in Saudi Arabia killing 19 US servicemen as 'praiseworthy
terrorism',
promising that other attacks would follow in November 1996 and further
admitted carrying out attacks on U.S. military personnel in Somalia in
1993
and Yemen in 1992, declaring that "we used to hunt them down in
Mogadishu";
stated in an interview broadcast in February 1997 that "if someone can
kill
an American soldier, it is better than wasting time on other matters."
Evidence was also developing which linked bin Laden to: the 1995 bombing
of
a U.S. military barracks in Riyadh which killed five;  Ramzi Yuosef, who
led
the 1993 World Trade Center attacks; and a 1994 assassination plot
against
President Clinton in the Philippines.

<p>Back in Houston, the Taliban was learning how the "other half lives,"
and
according to The Telegraph, "stayed in a five-star hotel and were
chauffeured in a company minibus." The  Taliban representatives "...were
amazed
by the luxurious homes of Texan oil barons. Invited to dinner at the
palatial home of Martin Miller, a vice-president of Unocal, they
marveled at
his swimming pool, views of the golf course and six bathrooms."   Mr.
Miller, said he hoped that UNOCAL had clinched the deal.

<p>Dick Cheney was then CEO of Haliburton Corporation, a pipeline services
vendor based in Texas.   Gushed Cheney in 1998, "I can't think of a time
when we've had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically
significant as the Caspian.  It's almost as if the opportunities have
arisen
overnight.  The good Lord didn't see fit to put oil and gas only where
there
are democratically elected regimes friendly to the United States.
Occasionally we have to operate in places where, all things considered,
one
would not normally choose to go. But we go where the business is." Would
Cheney bargain with the harborers of U.S. troop killers if that's where
the
business was?

<p>The Telegraph reported that Unocal had promised to start building the
pipeline and paying the Taliban immediately, with the added inducements
and
a donation of £500,000 to the University of Nebraska for courses in
Afghanistan to train 400 teachers, electricians, carpenters and
pipefitters.

<p>The Telegraph also reported, "The US government, which in the past has
branded the Taliban's policies against women and children "despicable",
appears anxious to please the fundamentalists to clinch the lucrative
pipeline contract." In a paper prepared by Neamatollah Nojumi, at the
Tufts
University  Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Nojumi wrote in August
1997 that Madeline Albright sat in a "full-dress CIA briefing" on the
Caspian region.  CIA agents then accompanied "some well-trained
petroleum
engineers" to the region.  Albright concluded that shaping the region's
policies was "one of the most exciting things that we can do."

<p>It's also exciting to the Bush Administration.   According to the
authors of
Bin Laden, the Hidden Truth, one of the FBI's leading counter terrorism
agents, John O'Neill, resigned last year in protest over the Bush
Administration's  alleged obstruction of his investigation into bin
Laden.
(A similar complaint has been filed on behalf of another unidentified
FBI
Agent by the conservative Judicial Watch public interest group.)
Supposedly
the Bush Administration had been meeting since January 2001 with the
Taliban, and was also reluctant to offend Saudi Arabians who O'Neill had
linked to bin Laden.  Mr. O'Neill, after leaving the FBI, assumed the
position of security director at the World Trade Center, where he was
killed
in the 911 attacks.

<p>As America's New War now begins focusing on other "rogue nations,"
UNOCAL's
stars have magically aligned.   About two months after the Houston
parties,
UNOCAL executive John Maresca addressed the House Subcommittee on Asia
and
the Pacific and urged support for establishment of an investor-friendly
climate in Afghanistan,  "... we have made it clear that construction of
our
proposed pipeline cannot begin until a recognized government is in place
that has the confidence of governments, lenders and our company."
Meaning
that UNOCAL's ability to construct the Afghan pipeline was  a cause
worthy
of U.S. taxpayer dollars.

<p>Maresca's prayers have been answered with the Taliban's replacement.
As
reported in Le Monde, the new Afghan government's head,  Hamid Karzai,
formerly served as a UNOCAL consultant.  Only nine days after Karzai's
ascension, President Bush nominated  another UNOCAL consultant and
former
Taliban defender, Zalmay Khalilzad, as his special envoy to Afghanistan.

<p>When  UNOCAL makes big bucks from the  pipeline they should  donate 50%
of
all pretax profits to the 911 Fund.   And they should also cut a very
special check to the widow of FBI Agent O'Neill.
