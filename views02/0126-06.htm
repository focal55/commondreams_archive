A BIZARRE thing happened to me over the past week: Conservative newspapers 
and columnists made a concerted effort to portray me as a guilty party in the 
Enron scandal. Why? Because in 1999, before coming to the New York Times, I 
was briefly paid to serve on an Enron advisory board.
<P>Never mind that, scrupulously following the Times' conflict of interest 
rules, I resigned from that board as soon as I agreed to write for the New 
York Times -- making me much more fastidious than, say, William Kristol, who 
served on that same board while editing the Weekly Standard. Never mind that I 
disclosed that past connection a year ago, the first time I wrote about Enron 
in this column. Never mind that the compensation I received per day was 
actually somewhat less than other companies were paying me at the time for 
speeches on world economic issues.
<P>And never mind that when I started writing in this column about issues of 
concern to Enron -- in particular, criticizing the role that market 
manipulation by energy companies played in the California power crisis -- my 
position was not at all what the company wanted to hear.
<P>Yet reading those attacks, you would think that I was a major-league white-
collar criminal.
<P>It's tempting to take this vendetta as a personal compliment: Some people 
are so worried about the effect of my writing that they will try anything to 
get me out of newspapers. But actually it was part of a broader effort by 
conservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it 
would stick.
<P>A few days ago, Tim Noah published a very funny piece in Slate about this 
effort, titled "Blaming liberalism for Enron." (Full disclosure: I used to 
write a column for Slate -- and Slate is owned by Microsoft. So I guess that 
makes me a Bill Gates crony. I even shook his hand once.) It describes the 
strategies conservative pundits have used to shift the blame for the Enron 
scandal onto the other side of the political spectrum.
<P>Among the ploys: Enron was in favor of the Kyoto Treaty, because it thought 
it could make money trading emission permits; see, environmentalism is the 
villain. Or how about this: Enron made money by exploiting the quirks of 
electricity markets that had been only partly deregulated; see, regulation is 
the villain.
<P>And, of course -- you knew this was coming -- it's all a reflection of 
Clinton-era moral decline. As we all know, Texas businessmen and politicians 
were models of probity; they never cooked their books or engaged in mutual 
back-scratching.
<P>One doubts that the people putting out this stuff really expect to convince 
anyone. But they do hope to muddy the waters.
<P>Why is Enron a problem for conservatives? Even if the Bush administration 
turns out to be squeaky clean, the scandal threatens perceptions that the 
right has spent decades creating. After all that effort to discredit concerns 
about the gap between haves and have-nots as obsolete "class warfare," along 
comes a real-life story that reads like a leftist morality play: Wealthy 
executives make off with millions while ordinary workers lose their jobs and 
their life savings. After all that effort to convince people that the private 
sector can police itself, the most admired company in America turns out to 
have been a giant Ponzi scheme -- and the most respected accounting firm turns 
out to have been an accomplice.
<P>You might think that the shock of the Enron scandal would make some 
conservatives reconsider their beliefs. But the die-hards prefer to sling muck 
at liberals, hoping it will stick.
<P>Sorry, guys; I'm clean. The muck stops here.</p>
