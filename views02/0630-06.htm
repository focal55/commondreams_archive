<p>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Only a person of unblemished virtue can get a job at 
Wal-Mart — a low-level job, that is, sorting stock, unloading trucks or operating 
a cash register. A drug test eliminates the chemical miscreants; a detailed "personality 
test" probes the job applicant's horror of theft and willingness to turn in an 
erring co-worker.</p>
<P> Extreme submissiveness to authority is another desirable trait. When I applied 
for a job at Wal-Mart in the spring of 2000, I was reprimanded for getting something 
"wrong" on this test: I had agreed only "strongly" to the proposition, "All rules 
have to be followed to the letter at all times." The correct answer was "totally 
agree."</p>
<P> Apparently the one rule that need not be slavishly adhered to at Wal-Mart 
is the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires that employees be paid 
time and a half if they work more than 40 hours in a week. Present and former 
Wal-Mart employees in 28 states <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0625-04.htm">are 
suing</a> the company for failure to pay overtime.</p>
<P> A Wal-Mart spokesman says it is company policy "to pay its employees properly 
for the hours they work." Maybe so, but it wasn't a policy I remember being emphasized 
in the eight-hour orientation session all new "associates" are required to attend. 
The session included a video on "associate honesty" that showed a cashier being 
caught on videotape as he pocketed some bills from the cash register. Drums beat 
ominously as he was led away in handcuffs and sentenced to four years in prison.</p>
<P> The personnel director warned us, in addition, against "time theft," or the 
use of company time for anything other than work — "anything at all," she said, 
which was interpreted in my store as including trips to the bathroom. We were 
to punch out even for our two breaks, to make sure we did not exceed the allotted 
15 minutes.</p>
<P> It turns out, however, that Wal-Mart management doesn't hold itself to the 
same standard of rectitude it expects from its low-paid employees. My first inkling 
of this came in the form of a warning from a co-worker not to let myself be persuaded 
to work overtime because, she explained, Wal-Mart doesn't pay overtime. Naïvely, 
I told her this was impossible; such a large company would surely not be flouting 
federal law.</p>
<P> I should have known better. We had been apprised, during orientation, that 
even after punching out, associates were required to wait on any customers who 
might approach them. Thanks to the further requirement that associates wear their 
blue and yellow vests until the moment they went out the door, there was no avoiding 
pesky last-minute customers.</p>
<P> Now some present and former employees have filed lawsuits against Wal-Mart. 
They say they were ordered to punch out after an eight-hour shift and then continue 
working for no pay. In a practice, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0625-04.htm">reported 
in The Times</a>, that you might expect to find only in a third-world sweatshop, 
Wal-Mart store managers in six states have locked the doors at closing time, some 
employees say, forcing all present to remain for an hour or more of unpaid labor.</p>
<P> This is "time theft" on a grand scale — practically a mass mugging. Of course, 
in my brief experience while doing research for a book on low-wage work, I found 
such practices or milder versions of them by no means confined to Wal-Mart.</p>
<P> At a Midwestern chain store selling hardware and lumber, I was offered an 
11-hour shift five days a week — with no overtime pay for the extra 15 hours. 
A corporate-run housecleaning service paid a starting wage of only $6.65 an hour 
but required us to show up in the morning 40 minutes before the clock started 
running — for meetings and to prepare for work by filling our buckets with cleaning 
supplies.</p>
<P> What has been revealed in corporate America over the past six months is a 
two-tier system of morality: Low-paid employees are required to be hard-working, 
law-abiding, rule-respecting straight arrows. More than that, they are often expected 
to exhibit a selfless generosity toward the company, readily "donating" chunks 
of their time free of charge. Meanwhile, as we have learned from the cases of 
Enron, Adelphia, ImClone, WorldCom and others, many top executives have apparently 
felt free to do whatever they want — conceal debts, lie about profits, engage 
in insider trading — to the dismay and sometimes ruin of their shareholders.</p>
<P> But investors are not the only victims of the corporate crime wave. Workers 
also suffer from management greed and dishonesty. In Wal-Mart's case, the moral 
gravity of its infractions is compounded by the poverty of its "associates," many 
of whom are paid less than $10 an hour. As workers discover that their problem 
is not just a rogue store manager or "bad apple" but management as a whole, we 
can expect at the very least widespread cynicism, and perhaps an epidemic of rule-breaking 
from below. </p>
