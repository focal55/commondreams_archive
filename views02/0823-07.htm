<p>Within hours after my column "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0804-08.htm">Bush’s 
Bad Idea Must Not Go Unchallenged</a>" was posted on Common Dreams I started to 
receive e-mails in response. A week later I had over 50 e-mails from all over 
the U.S. plus Canada and the U.K. 
<p>Though it’s only a tiny sample, the demographics are interesting. There were 
27 men and 19 women (the rest I couldn’t determine) About a dozen messages were 
just a line or two; one was two pages; most were two or three paragraphs. All 
were civil and most were careful with spelling, punctuation and grammar (not always 
common in e-mails) Ten gave no geographic location, three were from Canada, two 
from U.K. and the remainder from 15 states, including five from the DC area. The 
largest number came from Ohio, with multiple responses also from Maine, California, 
and Washington (state). 
<p>I was encouraged that everyone who wrote agreed that attacking Iraq was a bad 
idea, even though not all of them liked my ideas. Three upbraided me for questioning 
the effectiveness of the Green Party, and a few proposed other ideas like teach-ins, 
a general strike, or a mail-blitz on the Senate. Other suggestions included impeaching 
Bush, an Internet chain-letter, and a Constitutional amendment for a referendum 
on declaring war. 
<p>Several people expressed disappointment that I had, after all, no "magic bullet" 
to prevent Bush from going to war. That’s true: I don’t. I’m not sure "magic bullets" 
are a very good idea. Quick, easy fixes to complex human problems -- especially 
fixes that involve explosives -- hardly ever work in the long term, and have, 
historically, killed a lot of people. The scenario is simple: 
<p>Government too powerful? Blow up a Federal Building. Palestinians on land you 
want? Blow up their homes. Don’t like American imperialism? Blow up the World 
Trade Center. Saddam Hussein a menace? Blow up his country. 
<p>But none of my correspondents sought such solutions. Most supported long-term 
changes: new political parties, instant runoff voting, campaign finance reform, 
reducing US dependence on oil, supporting the UN -- all worthy ideas. 
<p>But most also recognized that we don’t have time to effect such changes before 
we get dragged into a war that could make them moot. GlobalSecurity.org has posted 
an "Iraq Countdown Clock" that postulates that Bush will attack Iraq on Nov. 6, 
the day after the U.S. election. 
<p>So I’ve kept looking for something that could help people speak up and stand 
up against the rhetorical bullets of "axis of evil" and "war on terrorism"; something 
that could quickly become an icon for opposition to attacking Iraq; something 
that would help people start conversations and identify allies. 
<p>Bumper stickers are good -- and Common Dreams is offering them, very reasonably. 
But bumper-stickers go on cars, not where people hold conversations. 
<p>And conversations are critical. Conversations -- at the kitchen table, the 
water-cooler, the church dinner, the board meeting, over a beer or a lunch-bucket, 
across the back fence, in the grocery checkout line or waiting room -- are how 
people form opinions and define stakes, learn that they are not alone in their 
doubts, and participate in developing public consensus about issues that matter 
to them. We need these conversations and they need to involve us all, -- "Joe 
Six-Pak", kids in high school, retirees in senior centers, single moms and minimum-wage 
workers -- not just readers of Common Dreams. 
<p>A good icon would need to be very cheap, universally available and unique enough 
to attract attention, something that could be pinned to a lapel, tacked on a door, 
or hung from a rear-view mirror. 
<p>How about a Moebius strip? Anyone can make one: 
<p>Cut a paper strip about eight inches long and a half-inch wide. Make it into 
a loop by bringing the ends together, but before you fasten them, twist one end 
so that its back side meets the front side of the other end. Glue, tape or staple 
the ends together to make a ring with a twist in it. 
<p>It’s a three-dimensional object with one continuous side and one continuous 
edge. It’s simple enough for young children to make, but has curious physical 
properties and the potential for appealing metaphors. It’s easily crushed or torn, 
but quickly replaceable; it’s not hazardous or threatening, and not useful for 
anything much except conversations. You can write on it -- all the way around 
until you come back where you started -- something like NO ATTACK ON IRAQ! 
<p>Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies has suggested that if Bush 
believes that attacking Iraq "is politically risky, he won’t do it." 
<p>It is infinitely sad that our President makes decisions about killing and war 
on the basis of political risks to himself. But if this is his game, we can beat 
him. There are signs that he may be starting to see those risks. 
<p>We don’t need a "magic bullet" to destroy Bush’s Bad Idea. We just need to 
come together and say NO! to attacking Iraq with enough voices to demonstrate 
that it’s politically risky. Maybe a simple paper icon could help do that.
