<p>Sixty-five thousand people and more than 100 heads of state, including Prime 
Minister Jean Chr&#233;tien, have come together to assess the promises made 10 
years ago at the Rio Earth summit and confront the fact that our planet is on 
the brink of environmental collapse. Yet already many activists are dubbing the 
World Summit on Sustainable Development &#34;Rio minus 10,&#34; instead of the 
hoped for &#34;Rio plus 10,&#34; in anticipation of a major sellout by our governments 
and the United Nations.</P>
<P>This sellout takes several forms. First, U.S. President George W. Bush (who 
is not in attendance) has instructed his negotiators to roll back two key principles 
agreed to by his father in the Rio framework: an international commitment to both 
the Precautionary Principle, whereby governments are supposed to err on the side 
of caution where there is the danger of environmental harm, and to an understanding 
that powerful nations of the industrialized North -- who played the biggest role 
in causing a problem -- should take the lead in addressing it.</P>
<P>As well, the U.S. government remains steadfastly opposed to any ceremony that 
would bring the Kyoto Protocol on climate change into effect at the summit. And 
the United States is touting what Mr. Bush calls a new &#34;global Marshall Plan&#34; 
-- the Millennium Challenge Account. The plan would tie aid only to those nations 
that open their economies to unregulated U.S. trade and investment.</P>
<P>Secondly, the United States, Canada and Europe are working hand in glove with 
the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization 
to subsume environmental and development agendas into their larger agenda of economic 
globalization, which includes unlimited growth, free trade, liberalized investment, 
privatization and a reduced role for government. The UN is being pressured to 
adopt as its overarching framework the text that came out of the WTO's ministerial 
meeting in Doha, Qatar, last December. The text contains, among other anti-environmental 
provisions, the clarification that WTO rules trump multilateral environment agreements 
and offer up &#34;environmental services,&#34; including water, to the control 
of the market.</P>
<P>It is crucial to remember that in the 10 years since Rio, globalization has 
made powerful inroads. World output has risen by 50 per cent, with trade and investment 
driving economic growth. Only three years after Rio, the WTO was created with 
binding enforcement rules ready to quash the soft and unenforceable promises made 
there. Together with the World Bank and the IMF -- in a holy trinity overseeing 
globalization -- the WTO has now hijacked the UN and the summit agenda.</P>
<P>The final threat lies with the transnational corporations that are poised to 
take advantage of this government retreat. Through the Business Action for Sustainable 
Development -- an amalgam of business created in part by the International Chamber 
of Commerce -- transnational corporations are working to block efforts to frame 
a regulatory mechanism to govern their activities. They are poised to take advantage 
of &#34;private-public&#34; partnerships being offered by the UN at the summit, 
and especially want access to the lucrative services sectors of water, energy 
and health.</P>
<P>One looming fight at the summit will center around the world's declining freshwater 
resources. As Fortune magazine says, &#34;Water promises to be to the 21st century 
what oil was to the 20th century -- the precious commodity that determines the 
wealth of nations.&#34;</P>
<P>On one side will be the WTO, the World Bank, First World governments and the 
huge water transnationals, arguing that the only way to save water will be to 
put it in private hands and sell it like energy on the open market.</P>
<P>On the other side will be international environmentalists, public-sector workers 
and human-rights groups working with local South African activists who insist 
that water is a fundamental human right that must be maintained as part of the 
global &#34;commons.&#34; This is a life-and-death issue in this country. Since 
the African National Congress adopted World Bank privatization plans, more than 
10 million South Africans have had their water turned off because they cannot 
afford the newly privatized water.</P>
<P>The setting of the summit tells the story. Government, WTO and corporate delegates 
gather in the lavish hotels and convention facilities of Sandton, the fabulously 
wealthy Johannesburg suburb that houses huge estates, English gardens and swimming 
pools, and has become South Africa's new financial epicenter.</P>
<P>At the same time, activists will gather in places such as nearby Alexandra 
township, a poverty-stricken community where sanitation, electricity and water 
services have been cut and which is divided from Sandton only by a river so polluted 
that it has cholera warning signs on its banks.</P>
<P>The summit presents an unparalleled opportunity to stop the Earth's ecological 
decline. Alas, other interests are at play. What will Canada's delegation do? 
<p><I>Maude Barlow is national chairperson of the <a href="http://www.canadians.org/" target="_new">Council 
of Canadians</a> and is in Alexandra township, not Sandton, during the summit.</i></p>
